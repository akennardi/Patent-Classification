At an electronic device, detecting a compatible external device, where the external device is
executing or has executed a first application. The detection may be made wirelessly. The
electronic device also receives usage information regarding the first application from the
external device. Display an affordance for user selection based on the received information.
When the affordance is selected, launch a second application on the electronic device, the
second application corresponding to the first application. In some examples, the second
application is a different version of the first application. Launching the second application
may additionally include bringing the second application to the same state as the first
application. For example, if e-mail is being drafted on the external device, the electronic
device may launch an e-mail editor showing the draft. In this way, a user can seamlessly
transition from the use of one electronic device to another electronic device.

                                               FIELD
[0006]       The present disclosure relates generally to computer user interfaces, and more
specifically to techniques for permitting a user to transition from use of one device to another,
seamlessly.
                                         BACKGROUND
[0007]       Modern electronic devices can support various software applications. Cellular
phones, tablet computers, and laptop computers can each execute messaging programs such
as e-mail editors and web browsers. A user who owns multiple electronic devices may elect
to use one device over another based on the device's suitability at the moment. For example,
while on-the-go, the user may prefer to read e-mail using a cellular phone. A device's
suitability can change, however. For example, when an e-mail requires a lengthy reply, the
user may prefer to draft the lengthy response using the full-sized keyboard of a laptop
computer. To accomplish this transition using conventional techniques, the user may power
up a laptop, launch an e-mail application, find the specific e-mail for which a response is
needed, and begin to prepare the response. It would be helpful if the user could transition
from use of one device to another, such as transition from reading an e-mail on one device to
drafting a reply on another device, in a seamless and cognitively continuous manner.

                             DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0081]      The following description sets forth exemplary methods, parameters, and the like.
It should be recognized, however, that such description is not intended as a limitation on the
scope of the present disclosure but is instead provided as a description of exemplary
embodiments.
[0082]      There is a need for electronic devices that permit a user to efficiently transition
from the use of one device to another while maintaining an overall sense of continuity. For
example, if the user is using one application on a first device, it would be helpful for the
second device-to which the user is transitioning-to automatically launch the same
application, so that the user may continue without loss of progress. Such techniques can
reduce the cognitive burden on a user who switches between uses of multiple computing
devices, thereby enhancing productivity. Further, such techniques can reduce processor and
battery power otherwise wasted on redundant user inputs.
[0083]      Below, FIGS. 1A-1B, 2, 3, 4A-4D, 16, and 23-42 provide a description of
exemplary devices for performing the techniques for transitioning between computing
devices. FIGS. 5A-5L, 6A-6D, 7A-7G, 8A-8C, 17A-17E, 18A-18D, and 19A-19C illustrate
exemplary user interfaces for transitioning between computing devices. FIGS. 9-15, 20-22,
and 43-53 are flow diagrams illustrating methods of managing event notifications in
accordance with some embodiments. The user interfaces in FIGS. 5A-5L, 6A-6D, 7A-7G,
8A-8C, 17A-17E, 18A-18D, and 19A-19C are used to illustrate the processes described
below, including the processes in FIGS. 9-15, 20-22, and 43-53.
                                                14

                                                                                          1002141603
[0084]        Although the following description uses terms "first," "second," etc. to describe
various elements, these elements should not be limited by the terms. These terms are only
used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first touch could be termed a
second touch, and, similarly, a second touch could be termed a first touch, without departing
from the scope of the various described embodiments. The first touch and the second touch
are both touches, but they are not the same touch.
[0085]        The terminology used in the description of the various described embodiments
herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be
limiting. As used in the description of the various described embodiments and the appended
claims, the singular forms "a", "an," and "the" are intended to include the plural forms as
well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term
"and/or" as used herein refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one
or more of the associated listed items. It will be further understood that the terms "includes,"
"including," "comprises," and/or "comprising," when used in this specification, specify the
presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do
not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps,
operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.
[0086]        The term "if' may be construed to mean "when" or "upon" or "in response to
determining" or "in response to detecting," depending on the context. Similarly, the phrase
"if it is determined" or "if [a stated condition or event] is detected" may be construed to mean
"upon determining" or "in response to determining" or "upon detecting [the stated condition
or event]" or "in response to detecting [the stated condition or event]," depending on the
context.
[0087]        Embodiments of electronic devices, user interfaces for such devices, and
associated processes for using such devices are described. In some embodiments, the device
is a portable communications device, such as a mobile telephone, that also contains other
functions, such as PDA and/or music player functions. Exemplary embodiments of portable
multifunction devices include, without limitation, the iPhone@, iPod Touch®, and iPad@
devices from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California. Other portable electronic devices, such as
laptops or tablet computers with touch-sensitive surfaces (e.g., touch screen displays and/or
touchpads), are, optionally, used. It should also be understood that, in some embodiments,
                                                 15

                                                                                          1002141603
the device is not a portable communications device, but is a desktop computer with a touch
sensitive surface (e.g., a touch screen display and/or a touchpad).
[0088]      In the discussion that follows, an electronic device that includes a display and a
touch-sensitive surface is described. It should be understood, however, that the electronic
device optionally includes one or more other physical user-interface devices, such as a
physical keyboard, a mouse, and/or a joystick.
[0089]      The device may support a variety of applications, such as one or more of the
following: a drawing application, a presentation application, a word processing application, a
website creation application, a disk authoring application, a spreadsheet application, a gaming
application, a telephone application, a video conferencing application, an e-mail application,
an instant messaging application, a workout support application, a photo management
application, a digital camera application, a digital video camera application, a web browsing
application, a digital music player application, and/or a digital video player application.
[0090]      The various applications that are executed on the device optionally use at least one
common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive surface. One or more
functions of the touch-sensitive surface as well as corresponding information displayed on the
device are, optionally, adjusted and/or varied from one application to the next and/or within a
respective application. In this way, a common physical architecture (such as the touch
sensitive surface) of the device optionally supports the variety of applications with user
interfaces that are intuitive and transparent to the user.
[0091]      Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable devices with touch
sensitive displays. FIG. 1A is a block diagram illustrating portable multifunction device 100
with touch-sensitive display system 112 in accordance with some embodiments. Touch
sensitive display 112 is sometimes called a "touch screen" for convenience and is sometimes
known as or called a "touch-sensitive display system." Device 100 includes memory 102
(which optionally includes one or more computer-readable storage mediums), memory
controller 122, one or more processing units (CPUs) 120, peripherals interface 118, RF
circuitry 108, audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, microphone 113, input/output (1/0)
subsystem 106, other input control devices 116, and external port 124. Device 100 optionally
includes one or more optical sensors 164. Device 100 optionally includes one or more
contact intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of contacts on device 100 (e.g., a touch
                                                 16

                                                                                            1002141603
sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system 112 of device 100). Device 100
optionally includes one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating tactile outputs on
device 100 (e.g., generating tactile outputs on a touch-sensitive surface such as touch
sensitive display system 112 of device 100 or touchpad 355 of device 300). These
components optionally communicate over one or more communication buses or signal lines
103.
[0092]      As used in the specification and claims, the term "intensity" of a contact on a
touch-sensitive surface refers to the force or pressure (force per unit area) of a contact (e.g., a
finger contact) on the touch-sensitive surface, or to a substitute (proxy) for the force or
pressure of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface. The intensity of a contact has a range of
values that includes at least four distinct values and more typically includes hundreds of
distinct values (e.g., at least 256). Intensity of a contact is, optionally, determined (or
measured) using various approaches and various sensors or combinations of sensors. For
example, one or more force sensors underneath or adjacent to the touch-sensitive surface are,
optionally, used to measure force at various points on the touch-sensitive surface. In some
implementations, force measurements from multiple force sensors are combined (e.g., a
weighted average) to determine an estimated force of a contact. Similarly, a pressure
sensitive tip of a stylus is, optionally, used to determine a pressure of the stylus on the touch
sensitive surface. Alternatively, the size of the contact area detected on the touch-sensitive
surface and/or changes thereto, the capacitance of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to
the contact and/or changes thereto, and/or the resistance of the touch-sensitive surface
proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto are, optionally, used as a substitute for the
force or pressure of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, the
substitute measurements for contact force or pressure are used directly to determine whether
an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is described in units
corresponding to the substitute measurements). In some implementations, the substitute
measurements for contact force or pressure are converted to an estimated force or pressure,
and the estimated force or pressure is used to determine whether an intensity threshold has
been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is a pressure threshold measured in units of
pressure). Using the intensity of a contact as an attribute of a user input allows for user
access to additional device functionality that may otherwise not be accessible by the user on a
reduced-size device with limited real estate for displaying affordances (e.g., on a touch
                                                  17

                                                                                             1002141603
sensitive display) and/or receiving user input (e.g., via a touch-sensitive display, a touch
sensitive surface, or a physical/mechanical control such as a knob or a button).
[0093]       As used in the specification and claims, the term "tactile output" refers to physical
displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device, physical displacement
of a component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device relative to another component
(e.g., housing) of the device, or displacement of the component relative to a center of mass of
the device that will be detected by a user with the user's sense of touch. For example, in
situations where the device or the component of the device is in contact with a surface of a
user that is sensitive to touch (e.g., a finger, palm, or other part of a user's hand), the tactile
output generated by the physical displacement will be interpreted by the user as a tactile
sensation corresponding to a perceived change in physical characteristics of the device or the
component of the device. For example, movement of a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch
sensitive display or trackpad) is, optionally, interpreted by the user as a "down click" or "up
click" of a physical actuator button. In some cases, a user will feel a tactile sensation such as
an "down click" or "up click" even when there is no movement of a physical actuator button
associated with the touch-sensitive surface that is physically pressed (e.g., displaced) by the
user's movements. As another example, movement of the touch-sensitive surface is,
optionally, interpreted or sensed by the user as "roughness" of the touch-sensitive surface,
even when there is no change in smoothness of the touch-sensitive surface. While such
interpretations of touch by a user will be subject to the individualized sensory perceptions of
the user, there are many sensory perceptions of touch that are common to a large majority of
users. Thus, when a tactile output is described as corresponding to a particular sensory
perception of a user (e.g., an "up click," a "down click," "roughness"), unless otherwise
stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to physical displacement of the device or a
component thereof that will generate the described sensory perception for a typical (or
average) user.
[0094]       It should be appreciated that device 100 is only one example of a portable
multifunction device, and that device 100 optionally has more or fewer components than
shown, optionally combines two or more components, or optionally has a different
configuration or arrangement of the components. The various components shown in FIG. 1A
are implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both hardware and software,
including one or more signal processing and/or application-specific integrated circuits.
                                                   18

                                                                                        1002141603
[0095]      Memory 102 may include one or more computer-readable storage mediums. The
computer-readable storage mediums may be tangible and non-transitory. Memory 102 may
include high-speed random access memory and may also include non-volatile memory, such
as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile
solid-state memory devices. Memory controller 122 may control access to memory 102 by
other components of device 100.
[0096]      Peripherals interface 118 can be used to couple input and output peripherals of the
device to CPU 120 and memory 102. The one or more processors 120 run or execute various
software programs and/or sets of instructions stored in memory 102 to perform various
functions for device 100 and to process data. In some embodiments, peripherals interface
118, CPU 120, and memory controller 122 may be implemented on a single chip, such as
chip 104. In some other embodiments, they may be implemented on separate chips.
[0097]      RF (radio frequency) circuitry 108 receives and sends RF signals, also called
electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 converts electrical signals to/from electromagnetic
signals and communicates with communications networks and other communications devices
via the electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 optionally includes well-known circuitry
for performing these functions, including but not limited to an antenna system, an RF
transceiver, one or more amplifiers, a tuner, one or more oscillators, a digital signal
processor, a CODEC chipset, a subscriber identity module (SIM) card, memory, and so forth.
RF circuitry 108 optionally communicates with networks, such as the Internet, also referred
to as the World Wide Web (WWW), an intranet and/or a wireless network, such as a cellular
telephone network, a wireless local area network (LAN) and/or a metropolitan area network
(MAN), and other devices by wireless communication. The RF circuitry 108 optionally
includes well-known circuitry for detecting near field communication (NFC) fields, such as
by a short-range communication radio. The wireless communication optionally uses any of a
plurality of communications standards, protocols, and technologies, including but not limited
to Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Enhanced Data GSM Environment
(EDGE), high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), high-speed uplink packet access
(HSUPA), Evolution, Data-Only (EV-DO), HSPA, HSPA+, Dual-Cell HSPA (DC-HSPDA),
long term evolution (LTE), near field communication (NFC), wideband code division
multiple access (W-CDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple
access (TDMA), Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE), Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) (e.g.,

[0098]      Audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, and microphone 113 provide an audio interface
between a user and device 100. Audio circuitry 110 receives audio data from peripherals
interface 118, converts the audio data to an electrical signal, and transmits the electrical
signal to speaker 111. Speaker 111 converts the electrical signal to human-audible sound
waves. Audio circuitry 110 also receives electrical signals converted by microphone 113
from sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 converts the electrical signal to audio data and
transmits the audio data to peripherals interface 118 for processing. Audio data may be
retrieved from and/or transmitted to memory 102 and/or RF circuitry 108 by peripherals
interface 118. In some embodiments, audio circuitry 110 also includes a headset jack (e.g.,
212, FIG. 2). The headset jack provides an interface between audio circuitry 110 and
removable audio input/output peripherals, such as output-only headphones or a headset with
both output (e.g., a headphone for one or both ears) and input (e.g., a microphone).
[0099]      I/O subsystem 106 couples input/output peripherals on device 100, such as touch
screen 112 and other input control devices 116, to peripherals interface 118. 1/0 subsystem
106 optionally includes display controller 156, optical sensor controller 158, intensity sensor
controller 159, haptic feedback controller 161, and one or more input controllers 160 for
other input or control devices. The one or more input controllers 160 receive/send electrical
signals from/to other input control devices 116. The other input control devices 116
optionally include physical buttons (e.g., push buttons, rocker buttons, etc.), dials, slider
switches, joysticks, click wheels, and so forth. In some alternate embodiments, input
controller(s) 160 are, optionally, coupled to any (or none) of the following: a keyboard, an
infrared port, a USB port, and a pointer device such as a mouse. The one or more buttons
(e.g., 208, FIG. 2) optionally include an up/down button for volume control of speaker 111
                                                20

                                                                                         1002141603
and/or microphone 113. The one or more buttons optionally include a push button (e.g., 206,
FIG. 2).
[00100]     A quick press of the push button may disengage a lock of touch screen 112 or
begin a process that uses gestures on the touch screen to unlock the device, as described in
U.S. Patent Application 11/322,549, "Unlocking a Device by Performing Gestures on an
Unlock Image," filed December 23, 2005, U.S. Pat. No. 7,657,849, which is hereby
incorporated by reference in its entirety. A longer press of the push button (e.g., 206) may
turn power to device 100 on or off. The user may be able to customize a functionality of one
or more of the buttons. Touch screen 112 is used to implement virtual or soft buttons and one
or more soft keyboards.
[00101]     Touch-sensitive display 112 provides an input interface and an output interface
between the device and a user. Display controller 156 receives and/or sends electrical signals
from/to touch screen 112. Touch screen 112 displays visual output to the user. The visual
output may include graphics, text, icons, video, and any combination thereof (collectively
termed "graphics"). In some embodiments, some or all of the visual output may correspond
to user-interface objects.
[00102]     Touch screen 112 has a touch-sensitive surface, sensor, or set of sensors that
accepts input from the user based on haptic and/or tactile contact. Touch screen 112 and
display controller 156 (along with any associated modules and/or sets of instructions in
memory 102) detect contact (and any movement or breaking of the contact) on touch screen
112 and convert the detected contact into interaction with user-interface objects (e.g., one or
more soft keys, icons, web pages, or images) that are displayed on touch screen 112. In an
exemplary embodiment, a point of contact between touch screen 112 and the user
corresponds to a finger of the user.
[00103]     Touch screen 112 may use LCD (liquid crystal display) technology, LPD (light
emitting polymer display) technology, or LED (light emitting diode) technology, although
other display technologies may be used in other embodiments. Touch screen 112 and display
controller 156 may detect contact and any movement or breaking thereof using any of a
plurality of touch sensing technologies now known or later developed, including but not
limited to capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic wave technologies, as well as
other proximity sensor arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of contact
                                                 21

                                                                                        1002141603
with touch screen 112. In an exemplary embodiment, projected mutual capacitance sensing
technology is used, such as that found in the iPhone@ and iPod Touch@ from Apple Inc. of
Cupertino, California.
[00104]      A touch-sensitive display in some embodiments of touch screen 112 may be
analogous to the multi-touch sensitive touchpads described in the following U.S. Patents:
6,323,846 (Westerman et al.), 6,570,557 (Westerman et al.), and/or 6,677,932 (Westerman),
and/or U.S. Patent Publication 2002/0015024A1, each of which is hereby incorporated by
reference in its entirety. However, touch screen 112 displays visual output from device 100,
whereas touch-sensitive touchpads do not provide visual output.
[00105]      A touch-sensitive display in some embodiments of touch screen 112 may be as
described in the following applications: (1) U.S. Patent Application No. 11/381,313,

Keyboard," filed September 16, 2005; and (9) U.S. Patent Application No. 11/367,749,
"Multi-Functional Hand-Held Device," filed March 3, 2006. All of these applications are
incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.
[00106]      Touch screen 112 may have a video resolution in excess of 100 dpi. In some
embodiments, the touch screen has a video resolution of approximately 160 dpi. The user
may make contact with touch screen 112 using any suitable object or appendage, such as a
stylus, a finger, and so forth. In some embodiments, the user interface is designed to work
primarily with finger-based contacts and gestures, which can be less precise than stylus-based
input due to the larger area of contact of a finger on the touch screen. In some embodiments,
the device translates the rough finger-based input into a precise pointer/cursor position or
command for performing the actions desired by the user.
                                                 22

                                                                                          1002141603
[00107]      In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, device 100 may include a
touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular functions. In some
embodiments, the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device that, unlike the touch
screen, does not display visual output. The touchpad may be a touch-sensitive surface that is
separate from touch screen 112 or an extension of the touch-sensitive surface formed by the
touch screen.
[00108]      Device 100 also includes power system 162 for powering the various components.
Power system 162 may include a power management system, one or more power sources
(e.g., battery, alternating current (AC)), a recharging system, a power failure detection circuit,
a power converter or inverter, a power status indicator (e.g., a light-emitting diode (LED))
and any other components associated with the generation, management and distribution of
power in portable devices.
[00109]      Device 100 may also include one or more optical sensors 164. FIG. 1A shows an
optical sensor coupled to optical sensor controller 158 in I/O subsystem 106. Optical sensor
164 may include charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) phototransistors. Optical sensor 164 receives light from the
environment, projected through one or more lenses, and converts the light to data
representing an image. In conjunction with imaging module 143 (also called a camera
module), optical sensor 164 may capture still images or video. In some embodiments, an
optical sensor is located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112 on the
front of the device so that the touch screen display may be used as a viewfinder for still
and/or video image acquisition. In some embodiments, an optical sensor is located on the
front of the device so that the user's image may be obtained for video conferencing while the
user views the other video conference participants on the touch screen display. In some
embodiments, the position of optical sensor 164 can be changed by the user (e.g., by rotating
the lens and the sensor in the device housing) so that a single optical sensor 164 may be used
along with the touch screen display for both video conferencing and still and/or video image
acquisition.
[00110]      Device 100 optionally also includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165.
FIG. 1A shows a contact intensity sensor coupled to intensity sensor controller 159 in I/O
subsystem 106. Contact intensity sensor 165 optionally includes one or more piezoresistive
strain gauges, capacitive force sensors, electric force sensors, piezoelectric force sensors,
                                                 23

                                                                                          1002141603
optical force sensors, capacitive touch-sensitive surfaces, or other intensity sensors (e.g.,
sensors used to measure the force (or pressure) of a contact on a touch-sensitive surface).
Contact intensity sensor 165 receives contact intensity information (e.g., pressure information
or a proxy for pressure information) from the environment. In some embodiments, at least
one contact intensity sensor is collocated with, or proximate to, a touch-sensitive surface
(e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112). In some embodiments, at least one contact
intensity sensor is located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112,
which is located on the front of device 100.
[00111]     Device 100 may also include one or more proximity sensors 166. FIG. 1A shows
proximity sensor 166 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately, proximity sensor 166
may be coupled to input controller 160 in I/O subsystem 106. Proximity sensor 166 may
perform as described in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 11/241,839, "Proximity Detector In
Handheld Device"; 11/240,788, "Proximity Detector In Handheld Device"; 11/620,702,
"Using Ambient Light Sensor To Augment Proximity Sensor Output"; 11/586,862,
"Automated Response To And Sensing Of User Activity In Portable Devices"; and
11/638,251, "Methods And Systems For Automatic Configuration Of Peripherals," which are
hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In some embodiments, the proximity
sensor turns off and disables touch screen 112 when the multifunction device is placed near
the user's ear (e.g., when the user is making a phone call).
[00112]     Device 100 optionally also includes one or more tactile output generators 167.
FIG. 1A shows a tactile output generator coupled to haptic feedback controller 161 in 1/0
subsystem 106. Tactile output generator 167 optionally includes one or more electroacoustic
devices such as speakers or other audio components and/or electromechanical devices that
convert energy into linear motion such as a motor, solenoid, electroactive polymer,
piezoelectric actuator, electrostatic actuator, or other tactile output generating component
(e.g., a component that converts electrical signals into tactile outputs on the device). Contact
intensity sensor 165 receives tactile feedback generation instructions from haptic feedback
module 133 and generates tactile outputs on device 100 that are capable of being sensed by a
user of device 100. In some embodiments, at least one tactile output generator is collocated
with, or proximate to, a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112) and,
optionally, generates a tactile output by moving the touch-sensitive surface vertically (e.g.,
in/out of a surface of device 100) or laterally (e.g., back and forth in the same plane as a
                                                 24

                                                                                           1002141603
surface of device 100). In some embodiments, at least one tactile output generator sensor is
located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112, which is located on the
front of device 100.
[00113]     Device 100 may also include one or more accelerometers 168. FIG. 1A shows
accelerometer 168 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately, accelerometer 168 may
be coupled to an input controller 160 in I/O subsystem 106. Accelerometer 168 may perform
as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050190059, "Acceleration-based Theft
Detection System for Portable Electronic Devices," and U.S. Patent Publication No.
20060017692, "Methods And Apparatuses For Operating A Portable Device Based On An
Accelerometer," both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In some
embodiments, information is displayed on the touch screen display in a portrait view or a
landscape view based on an analysis of data received from the one or more accelerometers.
Device 100 optionally includes, in addition to accelerometer(s) 168, a magnetometer (not
shown) and a GPS (or GLONASS or other global navigation system) receiver (not shown) for
obtaining information concerning the location and orientation (e.g., portrait or landscape) of
device 100.
[00114]     In some embodiments, the software components stored in memory 102 include
operating system 126, communication module (or set of instructions) 128, contact/motion
module (or set of instructions) 130, graphics module (or set of instructions) 132, text input
module (or set of instructions) 134, Global Positioning System (GPS) module (or set of
instructions) 135, and applications (or sets of instructions) 136. Furthermore, in some
embodiments, memory 102 (FIG. 1A) or 370 (FIG. 3) stores device/global internal state 157,
as shown in FIGS. 1A and 3. Device/global internal state 157 includes one or more of: active
application state, indicating which applications, if any, are currently active; display state,
indicating what applications, views or other information occupy various regions of touch
screen display 112; sensor state, including information obtained from the device's various
sensors and input control devices 116; and location information concerning the device's
location and/or attitude.
[00115]     Operating system 126 (e.g., Darwin, RTXC, LINUX, UNIX, OS X, iOS,
WINDOWS, or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks) includes various software
components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks (e.g., memory
                                                25

                                                                                            1002141603
management, storage device control, power management, etc.) and facilitates communication
between various hardware and software components.
[00116]     Communication module 128 facilitates communication with other devices over
one or more external ports 124 and also includes various software components for handling
data received by RF circuitry 108 and/or external port 124. External port 124 (e.g., Universal
Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to other devices or
indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.). In some embodiments, the
external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as, or similar to and/or
compatible with, the 30-pin connector used on iPod@ (trademark of Apple Inc.) devices.
[00117]     Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects contact with touch screen 112 (in
conjunction with display controller 156) and other touch-sensitive devices (e.g., a touchpad
or physical click wheel). Contact/motion module 130 includes various software components
for performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as determining if
contact has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining an intensity of the
contact (e.g., the force or pressure of the contact or a substitute for the force or pressure of the
contact), determining if there is movement of the contact and tracking the movement across
the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more finger-dragging events), and
determining if the contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a finger-up event or a break in contact).
Contact/motion module 130 receives contact data from the touch-sensitive surface.
Determining movement of the point of contact, which is represented by a series of contact
data, optionally includes determining speed (magnitude), velocity (magnitude and direction),
and/or an acceleration (a change in magnitude and/or direction) of the point of contact. These
operations are, optionally, applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger contacts) or to multiple
simultaneous contacts (e.g., "nultitouch"/multiple finger contacts). In some embodiments,
contact/motion module 130 and display controller 156 detect contact on a touchpad.
[00118]     In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 uses a set of one or more
intensity thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user (e.g., to
determine whether a user has "clicked" on an icon). In some embodiments, at least a subset
of the intensity thresholds are determined in accordance with software parameters (e.g., the
intensity thresholds are not determined by the activation thresholds of particular physical
actuators and can be adjusted without changing the physical hardware of device 100). For
example, a mouse "click" threshold of a trackpad or touch screen display can be set to any of
                                                 26

                                                                                          1002141603
a large range of predefined threshold values without changing the trackpad or touch screen
display hardware. Additionally, in some implementations, a user of the device is provided
with software settings for adjusting one or more of the set of intensity thresholds (e.g., by
adjusting individual intensity thresholds and/or by adjusting a plurality of intensity thresholds
at once with a system-level click "intensity" parameter).
[00119]     Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects a gesture input by a user. Different
gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns (e.g., different motions,
timings, and/or intensities of detected contacts). Thus, a gesture is, optionally, detected by
detecting a particular contact pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap gesture includes
detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up (liftoff) event at the same
position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g., at the position of
an icon). As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the touch-sensitive surface
includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or more finger-dragging
events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up (liftoff) event.
[00120]     Graphics module 132 includes various known software components for rendering
and displaying graphics on touch screen 112 or other display, including components for
changing the visual impact (e.g., brightness, transparency, saturation, contrast, or other visual
property) of graphics that are displayed. As used herein, the term "graphics" includes any
object that can be displayed to a user, including ,without limitation, text, web pages, icons
(such as user-interface objects including soft keys), digital images, videos, animations, and
the like.
[00121]     In some embodiments, graphics module 132 stores data representing graphics to
be used. Each graphic is, optionally, assigned a corresponding code. Graphics module 132
receives, from applications etc., one or more codes specifying graphics to be displayed along
with, if necessary, coordinate data and other graphic property data, and then generates screen
image data to output to display controller 156.
[00122]     Haptic feedback module 133 includes various software components for generating
instructions used by tactile output generator(s) 167 to produce tactile outputs at one or more
locations on device 100 in response to user interactions with device 100.
                                                27

[00123]     Text input module 134, which may be a component of graphics module 132,
provides soft keyboards for entering text in various applications (e.g., contacts 137, e-mail
140, IM 141, browser 147, and any other application that needs text input).
[00124]     GPS module 135 determines the location of the device and provides this
information for use in various applications (e.g., to telephone 138 for use in location-based
dialing; to camera 143 as picture/video metadata; and to applications that provide location
based services such as weather widgets, local yellow page widgets, and map/navigation
widgets).

[00144]     Each of the above-identified modules and applications corresponds to a set of
executable instructions for performing one or more functions described above and the
methods described in this application (e.g., the computer-implemented methods and other
information processing methods described herein). These modules (e.g., sets of instructions)
need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures, or modules, and thus
various subsets of these modules may be combined or otherwise rearranged in various
embodiments. For example, video player module may be combined with music player
module into a single module (e.g., video and music player module 152, FIG. 1A). In some
embodiments, memory 102 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified
above. Furthermore, memory 102 may store additional modules and data structures not
described above.
[00145]     In some embodiments, device 100 is a device where operation of a predefined set
of functions on the device is performed exclusively through a touch screen and/or a touchpad.
By using a touch screen and/or a touchpad as the primary input control device for operation
of device 100, the number of physical input control devices (such as push buttons, dials, and
the like) on device 100 may be reduced.
[00146]     The predefined set of functions that are performed exclusively through a touch
screen and/or a touchpad optionally include navigation between user interfaces. In some
                                                33

                                                                                          1002141603
embodiments, the touchpad, when touched by the user, navigates device 100 to a main, home,
or root menu from any user interface that is displayed on device 100. In such embodiments, a
"menu button" is implemented using a touchpad. In some other embodiments, the menu
button is a physical push button or other physical input control device instead of a touchpad.
[00147]      FIG. lB is a block diagram illustrating exemplary components for event handling
in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102 (FIG. 1A) or
370 (FIG. 3) includes event sorter 170 (e.g., in operating system 126) and a respective
application 136-1 (e.g., any of the aforementioned applications 137-151, 155, 380-390).
[00148]      Event sorter 170 receives event information and determines the application 136-1
and application view 191 of application 136-1 to which to deliver the event information.
Event sorter 170 includes event monitor 171 and event dispatcher module 174. In some
embodiments, application 136-1 includes application internal state 192, which indicates the
current application view(s) displayed on touch-sensitive display 112 when the application is
active or executing. In some embodiments, device/global internal state 157 is used by event
sorter 170 to determine which application(s) is (are) currently active, and application internal
state 192 is used by event sorter 170 to determine application views 191 to which to deliver
event information.
[00149]      In some embodiments, application internal state 192 includes additional
information, such as one or more of: resume information to be used when application 136-1
resumes execution, user interface state information that indicates information being displayed
or that is ready for display by application 136-1, a state queue for enabling the user to go
back to a prior state or view of application 136-1, and a redo/undo queue of previous actions
taken by the user.
[00150]      Event monitor 171 receives event information from peripherals interface 118.
Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on touch
sensitive display 112, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface 118 transmits
information it receives from 1/0 subsystem 106 or a sensor, such as proximity sensor 166,
accelerometer(s) 168, and/or microphone 113 (through audio circuitry 110). Information that
peripherals interface 118 receives from I/O subsystem 106 includes information from touch
sensitive display 112 or a touch-sensitive surface.
                                                34

                                                                                          1002141603
[00151]      In some embodiments, event monitor 171 sends requests to the peripherals
interface 118 at predetermined intervals. In response, peripherals interface 118 transmits
event information. In other embodiments, peripherals interface 118 transmits event
information only when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving an input above a
predetermined noise threshold and/or for more than a predetermined duration).
[00152]      In some embodiments, event sorter 170 also includes a hit view determination
module 172 and/or an active event recognizer determination module 173.
[00153]      Hit view determination module 172 provides software procedures for determining
where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views when touch-sensitive display
112 displays more than one view. Views are made up of controls and other elements that a
user can see on the display.
[00154]      Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set of
views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which
information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a
respective application) in which a touch is detected may correspond to programmatic levels
within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application. For example, the lowest level
view in which a touch is detected may be called the hit view, and the set of events that are
recognized as proper inputs may be determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the
initial touch that begins a touch-based gesture.
[00155]      Hit view determination module 172 receives information related to sub-events of a
touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized in a hierarchy, hit
view determination module 172 identifies a hit view as the lowest view in the hierarchy
which should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view is the lowest level
view in which an initiating sub-event occurs (e.g., the first sub-event in the sequence of sub
events that form an event or potential event). Once the hit view is identified by the hit view
determination module 172, the hit view typically receives all sub-events related to the same
touch or input source for which it was identified as the hit view.
[00156]      Active event recognizer determination module 173 determines which view or
views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In some
embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that only the hit
view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, active event
                                                35

                                                                                        1002141603
recognizer determination module 173 determines that all views that include the physical
location of a sub-event are actively involved views, and therefore determines that all actively
involved views should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments,
even if touch sub-events were entirely confined to the area associated with one particular
view, views higher in the hierarchy would still remain as actively involved views.
[00157]     Event dispatcher module 174 dispatches the event information to an event
recognizer (e.g., event recognizer 180). In embodiments including active event recognizer
determination module 173, event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to an
event recognizer determined by active event recognizer determination module 173. In some
embodiments, event dispatcher module 174 stores in an event queue the event information,
which is retrieved by a respective event receiver 182.
[00158]     In some embodiments, operating system 126 includes event sorter 170.
Alternatively, application 136-1 includes event sorter 170. In yet other embodiments, event
sorter 170 is a stand-alone module, or a part of another module stored in memory 102, such
as contact/motion module 130.
[00159]     In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes a plurality of event handlers
190 and one or more application views 191, each of which includes instructions for handling
touch events that occur within a respective view of the application's user interface. Each
application view 191 of the application 136-1 includes one or more event recognizers 180.
Typically, a respective application view 191 includes a plurality of event recognizers 180. In
other embodiments, one or more of event recognizers 180 are part of a separate module, such
as a user interface kit (not shown) or a higher level object from which application 136-1
inherits methods and other properties. In some embodiments, a respective event handler 190
includes one or more of: data updater 176, object updater 177, GUI updater 178, and/or event
data 179 received from event sorter 170. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater
176, object updater 177, or GUI updater 178 to update the application internal state 192.
Alternatively, one or more of the application views 191 include one or more respective event
handlers 190. Also, in some embodiments, one or more of data updater 176, object updater
177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a respective application view 191.
[00160]     A respective event recognizer 180 receives event information (e.g., event data
179) from event sorter 170 and identifies an event from the event information. Event
                                                36

                                                                                        1002141603
recognizer 180 includes event receiver 182 and event comparator 184. In some
embodiments, event recognizer 180 also includes at least a subset of: metadata 183, and event
delivery instructions 188 (which may include sub-event delivery instructions).
[00161]      Event receiver 182 receives event information from event sorter 170. The event
information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch
movement. Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional
information, such as location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a
touch, the event information may also include speed and direction of the sub-event. In some
embodiments, events include rotation of the device from one orientation to another (e.g.,
from a portrait orientation to a landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the event
information includes corresponding information about the current orientation (also called
device attitude) of the device.
[00162]      Event comparator 184 compares the event information to predefined event or sub
event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event, or
determines or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event
comparator 184 includes event definitions 186. Event definitions 186 contain definitions of
events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event 1 (187-1), event 2 (187
2), and others. In some embodiments, sub-events in an event (187) include, for example,
touch begin, touch end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple touching. In one
example, the definition for event 1 (187-1) is a double tap on a displayed object. The double
tap, for example, comprises a first touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a
predetermined phase, a first liftoff (touch end) for a predetermined phase, a second touch
(touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, and a second liftoff (touch
end) for a predetermined phase. In another example, the definition for event 2 (187-2) is a
dragging on a displayed object. The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or contact) on
the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a movement of the touch across touch
sensitive display 112, and liftoff of the touch (touch end). In some embodiments, the event
also includes information for one or more associated event handlers 190.
[00163]      In some embodiments, event definition 187 includes a definition of an event for a
respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator 184 performs a hit
test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event. For example, in
an application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on touch-sensitive
                                                 37

                                                                                          1002141603
display 112, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display 112, event comparator 184
performs a hit test to determine which of the three user-interface objects is associated with
the touch (sub-event). If each displayed object is associated with a respective event handler
190, the event comparator uses the result of the hit test to determine which event handler 190
should be activated. For example, event comparator 184 selects an event handler associated
with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit test.
[00164]      In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event (187) also includes
delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been determined
whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event recognizer's
event type.
[00165]      When a respective event recognizer 180 determines that the series of sub-events
do not match any of the events in event definitions 186, the respective event recognizer 180
enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which it disregards
subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other event recognizers,
if any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process sub-events of an
ongoing touch-based gesture.
[00166]      In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 includes metadata 183
with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event delivery system
should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers. In some
embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate
how event recognizers may interact, or are enabled to interact, with one another. In some
embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate
whether sub-events are delivered to varying levels in the view or programmatic hierarchy.
[00167]      In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 activates event handler
190 associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event are
recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 delivers event
information associated with the event to event handler 190. Activating an event handler 190
is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In some
embodiments, event recognizer 180 throws a flag associated with the recognized event, and
event handler 190 associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a predefined process.

                                                                                        1002141603
[00168]     In some embodiments, event delivery instructions 188 include sub-event delivery
instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating an event
handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to event
handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views. Event
handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views receive the
event information and perform a predetermined process.
[00169]     In some embodiments, data updater 176 creates and updates data used in
application 136-1. For example, data updater 176 updates the telephone number used in
contacts module 137, or stores a video file used in video player module. In some
embodiments, object updater 177 creates and updates objects used in application 136-1. For
example, object updater 177 creates a new user-interface object or updates the position of a
user-interface object. GUI updater 178 updates the GUI. For example, GUI updater 178
prepares display information and sends it to graphics module 132 for display on a touch
sensitive display.
[00170]     In some embodiments, event handler(s) 190 includes or has access to data updater
176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178. In some embodiments, data updater 176,
object updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a single module of a respective
application 136-1 or application view 191. In other embodiments, they are included in two or
more software modules.
[00171]     It shall be understood that the foregoing discussion regarding event handling of
user touches on touch-sensitive displays also applies to other forms of user inputs to operate
multifunction devices 100 with input devices, not all of which are initiated on touch screens.
For example, mouse movement and mouse button presses, optionally coordinated with single
or multiple keyboard presses or holds; contact movements such as taps, drags, scrolls, etc. on
touchpads; pen stylus inputs; movement of the device; oral instructions; detected eye
movements; biometric inputs; and/or any combination thereof are optionally utilized as inputs
corresponding to sub-events which define an event to be recognized.
[00172]     FIG. 2 illustrates a portable multifunction device 100 having a touch screen 112 in
accordance with some embodiments. The touch screen optionally displays one or more
graphics within user interface (UI) 200. In this embodiment, as well as others described
below, a user is enabled to select one or more of the graphics by making a gesture on the
                                                39

                                                                                          1002141603
graphics, for example, with one or more fingers 202 (not drawn to scale in the figure) or one
or more styluses 203 (not drawn to scale in the figure). In some embodiments, selection of
one or more graphics occurs when the user breaks contact with the one or more graphics. In
some embodiments, the gesture optionally includes one or more taps, one or more swipes
(from left to right, right to left, upward and/or downward), and/or a rolling of a finger (from
right to left, left to right, upward and/or downward) that has made contact with device 100.
In some implementations or circumstances, inadvertent contact with a graphic does not select
the graphic. For example, a swipe gesture that sweeps over an application icon optionally
does not select the corresponding application when the gesture corresponding to selection is a
tap.
[00173]      Device 100 may also include one or more physical buttons, such as "home" or
menu button 204. As described previously, menu button 204 may be used to navigate to any
application 136 in a set of applications that may be executed on device 100. Alternatively, in
some embodiments, the menu button is implemented as a soft key in a GUI displayed on
touch screen 112.
[00174]      In one embodiment, device 100 includes touch screen 112, menu button 204, push
button 206 for powering the device on/off and locking the device, volume adjustment
button(s) 208, subscriber identity module (SIM) card slot 210, headset jack 212, and
docking/charging external port 124. Push button 206 is, optionally, used to turn the power
on/off on the device by depressing the button and holding the button in the depressed state for
a predefined time interval; to lock the device by depressing the button and releasing the
button before the predefined time interval has elapsed; and/or to unlock the device or initiate
an unlock process. In an alternative embodiment, device 100 also accepts verbal input for
activation or deactivation of some functions through microphone 113. Device 100 also,
optionally, includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of
contacts on touch screen 112 and/or one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating
tactile outputs for a user of device 100.
[00175]      FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary multifunction device with a display and
a touch-sensitive surface in accordance with some embodiments. Device 300 need not be
portable. In some embodiments, device 300 is a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a
tablet computer, a multimedia player device, a navigation device, an educational device (such
as a child's learning toy), a gaming system, or a control device (e.g., a home or industrial
                                                 40

                                                                                          1002141603
controller). Device 300 typically includes one or more processing units (CPUs) 310, one or
more network or other communications interfaces 360, memory 370, and one or more
communication buses 320 for interconnecting these components. Communication buses 320
optionally include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls
communications between system components. Device 300 includes input/output (1/0)
interface 330 comprising display 340, which is typically a touch screen display. I/O interface
330 also optionally includes a keyboard and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 350 and
touchpad 355, tactile output generator 357 for generating tactile outputs on device 300 (e.g.,
similar to tactile output generator(s) 167 described above with reference to FIG. 1A), sensors
359 (e.g., optical, acceleration, proximity, touch-sensitive, and/or contact intensity sensors
similar to contact intensity sensor(s) 165 described above with reference to FIG. 1A).
Memory 370 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR
RAM, or other random access solid state memory devices; and optionally includes non
volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage
devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices. Memory 370
optionally includes one or more storage devices remotely located from CPU(s) 310. In some
embodiments, memory 370 stores programs, modules, and data structures analogous to the
programs, modules, and data structures stored in memory 102 of portable multifunction
device 100 (FIG. 1A), or a subset thereof. Furthermore, memory 370 optionally stores
additional programs, modules, and data structures not present in memory 102 of portable
multifunction device 100. For example, memory 370 of device 300 optionally stores drawing
module 380, presentation module 382, word processing module 384, website creation module
386, disk authoring module 388, and/or spreadsheet module 390, while memory 102 of
portable multifunction device 100 (FIG. 1A) optionally does not store these modules.
[00176]     Each of the above-identified elements in FIG. 3 may be stored in one or more of
the previously mentioned memory devices. Each of the above-identified modules
corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function described above. The above
identified modules or programs (e.g., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as
separate software programs, procedures, or modules, and thus various subsets of these
modules may be combined or otherwise rearranged in various embodiments. In some
embodiments, memory 370 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified
above. Furthermore, memory 370 may store additional modules and data structures not
described above.

                                                                                       1002141603
[00177]     Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces that may be
implemented on, for example, portable multifunction device 100.
[00178]     FIG. 4A illustrates an exemplary user interface for a menu of applications on
portable multifunction device 100 in accordance with some embodiments. Similar user
interfaces may be implemented on device 300. In some embodiments, user interface 400
includes the following elements, or a subset or superset thereof:
    *   Signal strength indicator(s) 402 for wireless communication(s), such as cellular and
        Wi-Fi signals;
    *   Time 404;
    *   Bluetooth indicator 405;
     " Battery status indicator 406;
    *   Tray 408 with icons for frequently used applications, such as:
            o Icon 416 for telephone module 138, labeled "Phone," which optionally
                includes an indicator 414 of the number of missed calls or voicemail
                messages;
            o Icon 418 for e-mail client module 140, labeled "Mail," which optionally
                includes an indicator 410 of the number of unread e-mails;
            o Icon 420 for browser module 147, labeled "Browser;" and
            o Icon 422 for video and music player module 152, also referred to as iPod
                (trademark of Apple Inc.) module 152, labeled "iPod;" and
    *   Icons for other applications, such as:
            o Icon 424 for IM module 141, labeled "Messages;"
            o Icon 426 for calendar module 148, labeled "Calendar;"
            o Icon 428 for image management module 144, labeled "Photos;"
            o Icon 430 for camera module 143, labeled "Camera;"
            o Icon 432 for online video module 155, labeled "Online Video;"
                                               42

                                                                                          1002141603
             o  Icon 434 for stocks widget 149-2, labeled "Stocks;"
             o  Icon 436 for map module 154, labeled "Maps;"
             o  Icon 438 for weather widget 149-1, labeled "Weather;"
             o  Icon 440 for alarm clock widget 149-4, labeled "Clock;"
             o  Icon 442 for workout support module 142, labeled "Workout Support;"
             o  Icon 444 for notes module 153, labeled "Notes;" and
             o  Icon 446 for a settings application or module, labeled "Settings," which
                provides access to settings for device 100 and its various applications 136.
[00179]     It should be noted that the icon labels illustrated in FIG. 4A are merely exemplary.
For example, icon 422 for video and music player module 152 may optionally be labeled
"Music" or "Music Player." Other labels are, optionally, used for various application icons.
In some embodiments, a label for a respective application icon includes a name of an
application corresponding to the respective application icon. In some embodiments, a label
for a particular application icon is distinct from a name of an application corresponding to the
particular application icon.
[00180]     FIG. 4B illustrates an exemplary user interface on a device (e.g., device 300, FIG.
3) with a touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a tablet or touchpad 355, FIG. 3) that is separate
from the display 450 (e.g., touch screen display 112). Device 300 also, optionally, includes
one or more contact intensity sensors (e.g., one or more of sensors 357) for detecting intensity
of contacts on touch-sensitive surface 451 and/or one or more tactile output generators 359
for generating tactile outputs for a user of device 300.
[00181]     Although some of the examples which follow will be given with reference to
inputs on touch screen display 112 (where the touch-sensitive surface and the display are
combined), in some embodiments, the device detects inputs on a touch-sensitive surface that
is separate from the display, as shown in FIG. 4B. In some embodiments, the touch-sensitive
surface (e.g., 451 in FIG. 4B) has a primary axis (e.g., 452 in FIG. 4B) that corresponds to a
primary axis (e.g., 453 in FIG. 4B) on the display (e.g., 450). In accordance with these
embodiments, the device detects contacts (e.g., 460 and 462 in FIG. 4B) with the touch
sensitive surface 451 at locations that correspond to respective locations on the display (e.g.,
in FIG. 4B, 460 corresponds to 468 and 462 corresponds to 470). In this way, user inputs
                                                 43

                                                                                            1002141603
(e.g., contacts 460 and 462, and movements thereof) detected by the device on the touch
sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in FIG. 4B) are used by the device to manipulate the user interface
on the display (e.g., 450 in FIG. 4B) of the multifunction device when the touch-sensitive
surface is separate from the display. It should be understood that similar methods are,
optionally, used for other user interfaces described herein.
[00182]     Additionally, while the following examples are given primarily with reference to
finger inputs (e.g., finger contacts, finger tap gestures, finger swipe gestures), it should be
understood that, in some embodiments, one or more of the finger inputs are replaced with
input from another input device (e.g., a mouse-based input or stylus input). For example, a
swipe gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click (e.g., instead of a contact) followed
by movement of the cursor along the path of the swipe (e.g., instead of movement of the
contact). As another example, a tap gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click while
the cursor is located over the location of the tap gesture (e.g., instead of detection of the
contact followed by ceasing to detect the contact). Similarly, when multiple user inputs are
simultaneously detected, it should be understood that multiple computer mice are, optionally,
used simultaneously, or a mouse and finger contacts are, optionally, used simultaneously.
[00183]     FIG. 4C illustrates exemplary personal electronic device 460. Device 460
includes body 462. In some embodiments, device 460 can include some or all of the features
described with respect to devices 100 and 300 (e.g., FIGS. 1A-4B). In some embodiments,
device 460 has touch-sensitive display screen 464, hereafter touch screen 464. Alternatively,
or in addition to touch screen 464, device 460 has a display and a touch-sensitive surface. As
with devices 100 and 300, in some embodiments, touch screen 464 (or the touch-sensitive
surface) may have one or more intensity sensors for detecting intensity of contacts (e.g.,
touches) being applied. The one or more intensity sensors of touch screen 464 (or the touch
sensitive surface) can provide output data that represents the intensity of touches. The user
interface of device 460 can respond to touches based on their intensity, meaning that touches
of different intensities can invoke different user interface operations on device 460.
[00184]     Techniques for detecting and processing touch intensity may be found, for
example, in related applications: International Patent Application Serial No.

[00185]      In some embodiments, device 460 has one or more input mechanisms 466 and
468. Input mechanisms 466 and 468, if included, can be physical. Examples of physical
input mechanisms include push buttons and rotatable mechanisms. In some embodiments,
device 460 has one or more attachment mechanisms. Such attachment mechanisms, if
included, can permit attachment of device 460 with, for example, hats, eyewear, earrings,
necklaces, shirts, jackets, bracelets, watch straps, chains, trousers, belts, shoes, purses,
backpacks, and so forth. These attachment mechanisms may permit device 460 to be worn
by a user.
[00186]      FIG. 4D depicts exemplary personal electronic device 470. In some
embodiments, device 470 can include some or all of the components described with respect
to FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 3. Device 470 has bus 472 that operatively couples I/O section 474 with
one or more computer processors 476 and memory 478. I/O section 474 can be connected to
display 480, which can have touch-sensitive component 482 and, optionally, touch-intensity
sensitive component 484. In addition, I/O section 474 can be connected with communication
unit 490 for receiving application and operating system data, using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, near
field communication (NFC), cellular, and/or other wireless communication techniques.
Device 470 can include input mechanisms 486 and/or 488. Input mechanism 486 may be a
rotatable input device or a depressible and rotatable input device, for example. Input
mechanism 488 may be a button, in some examples.
[00187]      Input mechanism 488 may be a microphone, in some examples. Personal
electronic device 470 can include various sensors, such as GPS sensor 492, accelerometer
494, directional sensor 495 (e.g., compass), gyroscope 496, motion sensor 498, and/or a
combination thereof, all of which can be operatively connected to I/O section 474.
[00188]      Memory 478 of personal electronic device 470 can be a non-transitory computer
readable storage medium, for storing computer-executable instructions, which, when
executed by one or more computer processors 476, for example, can cause the computer
processors to perform the techniques described above, including processes 900-1500 and
2000-2200 (FIGS. 9-15 and 20-22). The computer-executable instructions can also be stored
                                                 45

                                                                                           1002141603
and/or transported within any non-transitory computer-readable storage medium for use by or
in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer
based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the instructions
from the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device and execute the instructions. For
purposes of this document, a "non-transitory computer-readable storage medium" can be any
medium that can tangibly contain or store computer-executable instructions for use by or in
connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The non-transitory
computer-readable storage medium can include, but is not limited to, magnetic, optical,
and/or semiconductor storages. Examples of such storage include magnetic disks, optical
discs based on CD, DVD, or Blu-ray technologies, as well as persistent solid-state memory
such as flash, solid-state drives, and the like. Personal electronic device 470 is not limited to
the components and configuration of FIG. 4D, but can include other or additional
components in multiple configurations.
[00189]      As used here, the term "affordance" refers to a user-interactive graphical user
interface object that may be displayed on the display screen of devices 100, 300, 460 and/or
470 (FIGS. 1, 3, and 4C-D). For example, an image (e.g., icon), a button, and text (e.g.,
hyperlink) may each constitute an affordance.
[00190]      As used herein, the term "focus selector" refers to an input element that indicates
a current part of a user interface with which a user is interacting. In some implementations
that include a cursor or other location marker, the cursor acts as a "focus selector" so that
when an input (e.g., a press input) is detected on a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touchpad 355
in FIG. 3 or touch-sensitive surface 451 in FIG. 4B) while the cursor is over a particular user
interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider or other user interface element), the
particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some
implementations that include a touch screen display (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112
in FIG. 1A or touch screen 112 in FIG. 4A) that enables direct interaction with user interface
elements on the touch screen display, a detected contact on the touch screen acts as a "focus
selector" so that when an input (e.g., a press input by the contact) is detected on the touch
screen display at a location of a particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window,
slider, or other user interface element), the particular user interface element is adjusted in
accordance with the detected input. In some implementations, focus is moved from one
region of a user interface to another region of the user interface without corresponding
                                                 46

                                                                                            1002141603
movement of a cursor or movement of a contact on a touch screen display (e.g., by using a
tab key or arrow keys to move focus from one button to another button); in these
implementations, the focus selector moves in accordance with movement of focus between
different regions of the user interface. Without regard to the specific form taken by the focus
selector, the focus selector is generally the user interface element (or contact on a touch
screen display) that is controlled by the user so as to communicate the user's intended
interaction with the user interface (e.g., by indicating, to the device, the element of the user
interface with which the user is intending to interact). For example, the location of a focus
selector (e.g., a cursor, a contact, or a selection box) over a respective button while a press
input is detected on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touchpad or touch screen) will indicate
that the user is intending to activate the respective button (as opposed to other user interface
elements shown on a display of the device).
[00191]      As used in the specification and claims, the term "characteristic intensity" of a
contact refers to a characteristic of the contact based on one or more intensities of the contact.
In some embodiments, the characteristic intensity is based on multiple intensity samples. The
characteristic intensity is, optionally, based on a predefined number of intensity samples, or a
set of intensity samples collected during a predetermined time period (e.g., 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5,
1, 2, 5, 10 seconds) relative to a predefined event (e.g., after detecting the contact, prior to
detecting liftoff of the contact, before or after detecting a start of movement of the contact,
prior to detecting an end of the contact, before or after detecting an increase in intensity of the
contact, and/or before or after detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact). A
characteristic intensity of a contact is, optionally based on one or more of: a maximum value
of the intensities of the contact, a mean value of the intensities of the contact, an average
value of the intensities of the contact, a top 10 percentile value of the intensities of the
contact, a value at the half maximum of the intensities of the contact, a value at the 90 percent
maximum of the intensities of the contact, or the like. In some embodiments, the duration of
the contact is used in determining the characteristic intensity (e.g., when the characteristic
intensity is an average of the intensity of the contact over time). In some embodiments, the
characteristic intensity is compared to a set of one or more intensity thresholds to determine
whether an operation has been performed by a user. For example, the set of one or more
intensity thresholds may include a first intensity threshold and a second intensity threshold.
In this example, a contact with a characteristic intensity that does not exceed the first
threshold results in a first operation, a contact with a characteristic intensity that exceeds the
                                                  47

                                                                                          1002141603
first intensity threshold and does not exceed the second intensity threshold results in a second
operation, and a contact with a characteristic intensity that exceeds the second threshold
results in a third operation. In some embodiments, a comparison between the characteristic
intensity and one or more thresholds is used to determine whether or not to perform one or
more operations (e.g., whether to perform a respective operation or forgo performing the
respective operation) rather than being used to determine whether to perform a first operation
or a second operation.
[00192]      In some embodiments, a portion of a gesture is identified for purposes of
determining a characteristic intensity. For example, a touch-sensitive surface may receive a
continuous swipe contact transitioning from a start location and reaching an end location, at
which point the intensity of the contact increases. In this example, the characteristic intensity
of the contact at the end location may be based on only a portion of the continuous swipe
contact, and not the entire swipe contact (e.g., only the portion of the swipe contact at the end
location). In some embodiments, a smoothing algorithm may be applied to the intensities of
the swipe contact prior to determining the characteristic intensity of the contact. For
example, the smoothing algorithm optionally includes one or more of: an unweighted sliding
average smoothing algorithm, a triangular smoothing algorithm, a median filter smoothing
algorithm, and/or an exponential smoothing algorithm. In some circumstances, these
smoothing algorithms eliminate narrow spikes or dips in the intensities of the swipe contact
for purposes of determining a characteristic intensity.
[00193]      The intensity of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface may be characterized
relative to one or more intensity thresholds, such as a contact-detection intensity threshold, a
light press intensity threshold, a deep press intensity threshold, and/or one or more other
intensity thresholds. In some embodiments, the light press intensity threshold corresponds to
an intensity at which the device will perform operations typically associated with clicking a
button of a physical mouse or a trackpad. In some embodiments, the deep press intensity
threshold corresponds to an intensity at which the device will perform operations that are
different from operations typically associated with clicking a button of a physical mouse or a
trackpad. In some embodiments, when a contact is detected with a characteristic intensity
below the light press intensity threshold (e.g., and above a nominal contact-detection
intensity threshold below which the contact is no longer detected), the device will move a
focus selector in accordance with movement of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface
                                                 48

                                                                                          1002141603
without performing an operation associated with the light press intensity threshold or the
deep press intensity threshold. Generally, unless otherwise stated, these intensity thresholds
are consistent between different sets of user interface figures.
[00194]      An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the
light press intensity threshold to an intensity between the light press intensity threshold and
the deep press intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as a "light press" input. An
increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the deep press
intensity threshold to an intensity above the deep press intensity threshold is sometimes
referred to as a "deep press" input. An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from
an intensity below the contact-detection intensity threshold to an intensity between the
contact-detection intensity threshold and the light press intensity threshold is sometimes
referred to as detecting the contact on the touch-surface. A decrease of characteristic
intensity of the contact from an intensity above the contact-detection intensity threshold to an
intensity below the contact-detection intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as detecting
liftoff of the contact from the touch-surface. In some embodiments, the contact-detection
intensity threshold is zero. In some embodiments, the contact-detection intensity threshold is
greater than zero.
[00195]      In some embodiments described herein, one or more operations are performed in
response to detecting a gesture that includes a respective press input or in response to
detecting the respective press input performed with a respective contact (or a plurality of
contacts), where the respective press input is detected based at least in part on detecting an
increase in intensity of the contact (or plurality of contacts) above a press-input intensity
threshold. In some embodiments, the respective operation is performed in response to
detecting the increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity
threshold (e.g., a "down stroke" of the respective press input). In some embodiments, the
press input includes an increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input
intensity threshold and a subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact below the press-input
intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the
subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below the press-input threshold
(e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input).
[00196]      In some embodiments, the device employs intensity hysteresis to avoid accidental
inputs sometimes termed "jitter," where the device defines or selects a hysteresis intensity
                                                 49

                                                                                             1002141603
threshold with a predefined relationship to the press-input intensity threshold (e.g., the
hysteresis intensity threshold is X intensity units lower than the press-input intensity
threshold or the hysteresis intensity threshold is 75%, 90%, or some reasonable proportion of
the press-input intensity threshold). Thus, in some embodiments, the press input includes an
increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity threshold and a
subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold that
corresponds to the press-input intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed
in response to detecting the subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below
the hysteresis intensity threshold (e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input).
Similarly, in some embodiments, the press input is detected only when the device detects an
increase in intensity of the contact from an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity
threshold to an intensity at or above the press-input intensity threshold and, optionally, a
subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact to an intensity at or below the hysteresis
intensity, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the press input
(e.g., the increase in intensity of the contact or the decrease in intensity of the contact,
depending on the circumstances).
[001971          For ease of explanation, the descriptions of operations performed in response
to a press input associated with a press-input intensity threshold or in response to a gesture
including the press input are, optionally, triggered in response to detecting either: an increase
in intensity of a contact above the press-input intensity threshold, an increase in intensity of a
contact from an intensity below the hysteresis intensity threshold to an intensity above the
press-input intensity threshold, a decrease in intensity of the contact below the press-input
intensity threshold, and/or a decrease in intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity
threshold corresponding to the press-input intensity threshold. Additionally, in examples
where an operation is described as being performed in response to detecting a decrease in
intensity of a contact below the press-input intensity threshold, the operation is, optionally,
performed in response to detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact below a hysteresis
intensity threshold corresponding to, and lower than, the press-input intensity threshold.
[001981          As used herein, an "installed application" refers to a software application that
has been downloaded onto an electronic device (e.g., devices 100, 300, 460, and/or 470) and
is ready to be launched (e.g., become opened) on the device. In some embodiments, a
downloaded application becomes an installed application by way of an installation program
                                                  50

                                                                                          1002141603
that extracts program portions from a downloaded package and integrates the extracted
portions with the operating system of the computer system.
[00199]           As used herein, the term "open application" or "executing application" refers
to a software application with retained state information (e.g., as part of device/global internal
state 157 and/or application internal state 192). An open or executing application may be any
one of the following types of applications:
    *    an active application, which is currently displayed on a display screen of the device
         that the application is being used on;
    *    a background application (or background processes), which is not currently displayed,
         but one or more processes for the application are being processed by one or more
         processors; and
    *    a suspended or hibernated application, which is not running, but has state information
         that is stored in memory (volatile and non-volatile, respectively) and that can be used
         to resume execution of the application.
[00200]      As used herein, the term "closed application" refers to software applications
without retained state information (e.g., state information for closed applications is not stored
in a memory of the device). Accordingly, closing an application includes stopping and/or
removing application processes for the application and removing state information for the
application from the memory of the device. Generally, opening a second application while in
a first application does not close the first application. When the second application is
displayed and the first application ceases to be displayed, the first application becomes a
background application.
[00201]      Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces ("UI") and
associated processes that may be implemented on a multifunction device with a display and a
touch-sensitive surface, such as devices 100, 300, 460, and/or 470, to improve a user's
experience in transitioning between different electronic devices. For brevity, the
ftnctionalities described herein may be referred to as "continuity" functionalities.
1.       Exemplary use of continuity functionality
                                                  51

                                                                                        1002141603
[00202]     FIGS. 5A-5D demonstrate an exemplary transition between the use of two
different electronic devices using continuity functionalities. In FIG. 5A, user 502 is using
electronic device 504. Electronic device 504 may be portable multifunction device 100 in
some embodiments. As shown, electronic device 504 is a cellular phone. Cellular phone 504
is displaying user interface screen 506. User interface screen 506 is part of a messaging
application that is executing on cellular phone 504. User interface screen 506 shows a
message transcript between user 502 and participant 510, named John. The illustrated
message transcript includes message bubbles 508 representing a messaging conversation. In
the ongoing conversation, John (participant 510) has asked user 504 for a web site URL.
[00203]     Because cellular phone 504 has a relatively small display screen, looking up the
requested web site URL on cellular phone 504 may prove inefficient. Instead, user 504 may
wish to find the requested information on an electronic device having a relatively larger
display. As shown in FIG. 5B, user 504 approaches tablet computer 512 for this purpose, as
tablet computer 512 has a larger screen and is better suited for the task. As user 502, who is
holding cellular phone 504, approaches tablet computer 512, the two devices come within
wireless communications range of each other and begin wireless communication. Tablet
computer 512 may detect the presence of cellular phone 504 via a low-energy wireless
protocol. Upon detection, tablet computer 512 may obtain from cellular phone 504 additional
information, such as usage information, indicating that a messaging application is active on
cellular phone 504.
[00204]     Turning to FIG. 5C, based on this information, tablet computer 512 displays
affordance 514 indicating that is possible for the user to continue his on-going messaging
conversation on tablet computer 512. Affordance 514 may be displayed on user-interface
locked screen 515. Restated, in response to detecting cellular phone 504, and receiving usage
information (regarding the messaging application being used on cellular phone 504), tablet
computer 512 displays continuity affordance (e.g., icon) 514 to inform the user that
continuity of the messaging application across the devices is possible.
[00205]     As used here, the term "affordance" refers to a user-interactive graphical user
interface object may be displayed on the display screen of device 100, 300, and/or 460 (FIGS.
1, 3, and 4C). For example, an image (e.g., icon), a button, and text (e.g., hyperlink) may
each constitute an affordance.
                                                52

                                                                                           1002141603
[00206]      A user may select the displayed continuity affordance to launch a corresponding
messaging application. In some embodiments, a user may select a continuity affordance via a
touch gesture (e.g., tap, swipe, flick, long touch). In some embodiments, a user may select a
continuity affordance via a mouse gesture (e.g., hover, click, double-click, drag). In the
example of FIG. 5D, user 502 may swipe continuity affordance 514 upwards (as indicated by
arrow 516) to launch the corresponding messaging application on tablet computer 512. That
is, in response to a swipe gesture in a particular direction (e.g., up), tablet computer 512
unlocks and launches a messaging application. The messaging application that is launched
on tablet computer 512 may be a version of the active messaging application on cellular
phone 504. For example, the active messaging application on tablet computer 512 may be
Messages for iPad@ while the active messaging application on cellular phone 504 may be
Messages for iPhone@, both made by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California.
[00207]      In addition to launching a corresponding messaging application, tablet computer
512 may also display the same message transcript that is shown on cellular phone 504.
Further, because tablet computer 512 has a larger display screen, additional message bubble
518 may be shown (recall only bubbles 508 were shown on cellular phone 504). From here,
user 502 may switch to a web browsing application on tablet computer 512 to find the
requested URL for participant 510.
[00208]      Through the above-described continuity techniques, user 502 transitioned from
cellular phone 504 to tablet computer 512 without a loss of progress. During the transition,
user 502 did not need to find and launch messages application manually. Further, during the
transition, user 502 did not need to search for the message transcript involving participant
510 among other message transcripts. Rather, the state of the messaging application survived
the transition from cellular phone 504 to tablet computer 512.
[00209]      U.S. Patent Application 11/322,549, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,657,849, describes that,
in the user-interface lock state (hereinafter the "lock state"), a device such as device 100, 300,
or 460 is powered on and operational but ignores most, if not all, user input. That is, the
device takes no action in response to user input and/or the device is prevented from
performing a predefined set of operations in response to the user input. The predefined set of
operations may include navigation between user interfaces and activation or deactivation of a
predefined set of functions. The lock state may be used to prevent unintentional or
unauthorized use of the device or activation or deactivation of functions on the device. When
                                                 53

                                                                                           1002141603
the device is in the lock state, the device may be said to be locked. In some embodiments, the
device in the lock state may respond to a limited set of user inputs, including input that
corresponds to an attempt to transition the device to the user-interface unlock state or input
that corresponds to powering the device off. In other words, the locked device responds to
user input corresponding to attempts to transition the device to the user-interface unlock state
or powering the device off, but does not respond to user input corresponding to attempts to
navigate between user interfaces. It should be appreciated that even if the device ignores a
user input, the device may still provide sensory feedback (such as visual, audio, or vibration
feedback) to the user upon detection of the input to indicate that the input will be ignored. A
locked device, however, may still respond to a limited class of input. The limited class may
include input that is determined by the device to correspond to an attempt to transition the
device to the user-interface unlock state, including inputs that invoke continuity features.
[00210]     In the user-interface unlock state (hereinafter the "unlock state"), the device is in
its normal operating state, detecting and responding to user input corresponding to interaction
with the user interface. A device that is in the unlock state may be described as an unlocked
device. An unlocked device detects and responds to user input for navigating between user
interfaces, entry of data and activation or deactivation of functions. In embodiments where
the device includes a touch screen, the unlocked device detects and responds to contact
corresponding to navigation between user interfaces, entry of data and activation or
deactivation of functions through the touch screen.
[00211]     FIG. 5E illustrates another example of continuity between cellular phone 504 and
tablet computer 512, but involves a different exemplary application-      in this instance a web
browsing application. FIG. 5E demonstrates how continuity functionalities may benefit a
user who is working with a lengthy document. As shown, cellular phone 504 is displaying
web-page 520 via a web browsing application. Because cellular phone 504 has a relatively
small display screen, the user may wish to transition to a larger device, such as tablet
computer 512, that is in-range. Because the two devices are in-range, tablet computer 512
may detect the proximity of cellular phone 504 wirelessly and may receive usage information
regarding the active web browsing application from cellular phone 504. In response to this
detection and the received usage information, tablet computer 512 displays continuity
affordance 522. Continuity affordance 522 may include a thumbnail image indicating that
the application to be launched is a web browsing application. When the affordance is
                                                54

                                                                                          1002141603
selected, tablet computer 512 launches its version of the web-browsing application. Further,
upon launching the corresponding web browsing application, tablet computer 512 displays
the portion of web-page 520 that is displayed on cellular phone 504. Thus, user 502 may
continue reading from where he left off. Note that, because tablet computer 512 has a larger
display screen, additional portion 521 of web-page 520 may also be displayed for viewing.
[00212]     In some embodiments, a user selects (e.g., invokes) a continuity affordance by
swiping the affordance in a particular direction. In the example of FIG. 5D, an upward swipe
is used to invoke continuity affordance 514. When this is the case, in response to a tap on the
continuity affordance-which is insufficient for invoking continuity features-       the device
may bounce the continuity affordance (via visual animation) to indicate to the user that a
swipe is necessary to invoke the continuity features. Optionally, the device may display
instructional text informing the user that a swipe is necessary.   Optionally, device 100 may
require the user to swipe the continuity affordance beyond a predetermined threshold distance
in order for the swipe to register as a selection. When this is the case, in response to a swipe
shorter than the threshold, the device may bounce-back the affordance, thereby suggesting to
the user that a longer swipe is necessary to invoke the continuity features. Optionally, the
device may display an instructional text informing the user that a longer swipe is necessary to
invoke continuity features. Optionally, the device may display the instructional text only
after the user has interacted with the affordance a few times but failed to invoke the feature in
each attempt. Alternatively, in some embodiments, a user selects a continuity affordance by
tapping the affordance. In the example of FIG. 5E, continuity affordance 522 may be
selected by a tap.
2.      Exemplary user interfaces for invoking continuity functionality
[00213]     Attention is now directed to additional ways in which affordances for invoking
continuity functionalities may be displayed, with reference to FIGS. 5F-5N. As shown in
FIG. 5F, in some embodiments, continuity affordance 522 becomes displayed on user
interface lock screen 523 when device 100a senses a compatible external device that is in
range and that is transmitting relevant application usage data. (Device 100a may be device
100 in some embodiments.) The display of continuity affordance 522 may be temporary,
meaning that continuity affordance 522 may cease to be displayed after some condition. For
example, continuity affordance 522 may be removed from display after it has been displayed
for a predetermined time (e.g., 8 seconds). As another example, continuity affordance 522
                                                 55

                                                                                         1002141603
may be removed from display if the compatible external device leaves communications
range. Optionally, continuity affordance 522 does not display if the touch-sensitive display
of device 100a is powered-on after a predetermined time (e.g., 8 seconds) has elapsed since
the compatible external device came within range, even if the device has transmitted relevant
application usage data. Optionally, continuity affordance 522 becomes displayed on lock
screen 523 only when the compatible external device (or active application thereon) was
recently used within a predetermined amount of time (e.g., within the last 8 seconds).
[00214]     Also as shown in FIG. 5F, in some embodiments, continuity affordance 526
appears permanently on user interface lock screen 525 of device 100b, meaning that the
affordance is displayed whenever lock screen 525 is displayed. (Device 100b may be device
100 in some embodiments.) Permanent continuity affordance 526 may take on one visual
appearance when a compatible device is nearby and continuity is possible. The affordance
may take on another visual appearance when there is no device to transition to, e.g., it may
appear disabled. Permanent continuity affordance 526 may be used where it is desirable for
continuity features to have an emphasized visual profile.
[00215]     Also as shown in FIG. 5F, in some embodiments, continuity affordance 526 is
displayed on lock screen 527 of device 100c as a message in a queue of other system
messages. (Device 100c may be device 100 in some embodiments.) As shown, device 100c
may display notification messages notifying a user to incoming messages, phone calls,
calendar entries, and the like. Device 100c may organize these notification messages into a
queue. In these embodiments, continuity affordance 526 may appear in the same manner to
notify the user of the device's capability to launch a corresponding application. This
placement may be used where it is desirable for continuity features to have a reduced, limited
visual profile.
[00216]     FIG. 5G illustrates the incorporation of continuity features with a biometric
reader. Device 100 may have a biometric reader that is used for unlocking the device. In
FIG. 5G, device 100 is equipped with a biometric reader in the form of fingerprint reader
534. Device 100 may be configured to unlock when fingerprint reader 534 reads a known
fingerprint. When unlocking, if device 100 detects a compatible external device that is in
range and that is transmitting relevant application usage data, device 100 may display dialog
536. Dialog 536 asks the user whether continuity is desired. If the user indicates "yes,"
device 100 launches a corresponding application using continuity techniques, as discussed

                                                                                           1002141603
above. For example, device 100 may launch a messaging application that corresponds to the
messaging application executing on device 504 (FIG. 5A). The launched messaging
application may display the message transcript shown in user interface screen 506 (FIG. 5A).
[00217]     FIG. 5H illustrates the incorporation of continuity features into a multi-tasking
user interface screen in some embodiments. As shown, device 100 may display multi-tasking
screen 538. Multi-tasking screen 538 may be a user interface for choosing, from among
multiple active applications, an application that should become the active application on
device 100. For this purpose, multi-tasking screen 538 may include affordances 540, 542,
and 544 that correspond to different applications. Affordances 540, 542, and 544 are located
near the left side, center, and right side of screen 538, respectively. Center affordance 542
may represent the most-recently active application on device 100. Right affordance 544 may
represent a background application running on device 100. A user selection (e.g., tap) of
affordance 542 or 544 may make the corresponding application the active application on
device 100.
[00218]     Left-most affordance 540 may be reserved for invoking continuity features.
Affordance 540 may be displayed when device 100 detects a compatible external device that
is in-range and that is transmitting relevant application usage data. In the illustrated example,
a user selection (e.g., tap) of affordance 540 causes device 100 to launch a corresponding
application using continuity techniques. For instance, in response to a user selection of
affordance 540, device 100 may launch a messaging application that corresponds to the
messaging application last used on device 504 (FIG. 5A). The launched messaging
application may display the message transcript shown in user interface screen 506 (FIG. 5A).
[00219]     To facilitate a user's identification of the applications represented by affordances
of 540, 542, and 544, each of the affordances may display a thumbnail image of the
application. For example, affordance 540 may show a thumbnail image of user interface
screen 506 to indicate that the message transcript (e.g., application state) that would be
launched in response to the user's selection of the affordance. In addition, to facilitate a
user's selection of affordance 540, multi-tasking screen 538 may be scrollable. That is, the
use may swipe center affordance 542 rightward to bring affordance 540 to the center of the
screen for more convenient selection.
                                                  57

                                                                                            1002141603
[00220]     FIG. 51 illustrates the inclusion of continuity features into yet other user interface
screens. The operating system of a device like device 100 may provide certain screens that
are "pervasive" in the sense that the screens are generally accessible within the operating
environment. The incorporation of continuity affordances into one or more of these
pervasive screens may promote the accessibility of continuity features throughout the
operating environment. As shown in FIG. 5I, while device 100 is displaying a user interface
screen 550, a user may swipe downwards from the top edge of screen 550 as indicated by
arrow 546 to reveal notifications screen 530. (User interface screen 550 may be an
application screen or a "home" screen.) Alternatively, a user may swipe rightwards from the
left edge of screen 550 to reveal search screen 560, as indicated by arrow 547. Alternatively,
a user may swipe upwards from the bottom edge of screen 550 to reveal control screen 570,
as indicated by arrow 548. (As used here, the left, top, and bottom edges lie on a plane that is
coplanar with the display surface.)
[00221]     Notifications screen 530 may display notification messages notifying a user to
device activity such as incoming messages, phone calls, calendar entries, and the like.
Notifications screen 530 may also include continuity affordance 532 to notify the user of the
device's capability to launch an application corresponding to the active application of an in
range external device. A user may select (e.g., tap) continuity affordance 532 to launch a
corresponding application on device 100. Search screen 560 may display a search criteria
and a set of related search results. The search results may include continuity affordance 562.
A user may select (e.g., tap) continuity affordance 562 to launch a corresponding application
on device 100. Control screen 570 may have affordances for controlling the operation of
device 100, such as switches for toggling airplane mode, wireless communication, cellular
communication, peer-to-peer communication, and so forth. In some embodiments, control
screen 570 may include continuity affordance 572 for switching on/off continuity features,
meaning that a user can select (e.g., tap) continuity affordance 572 to enable/disable
continuity features. In some embodiments, control screen 570 includes continuity affordance
572 for launching an application using continuity features, meaning that a user can (e.g., tap)
continuity affordance 572 to launch a corresponding application on device 100.
[00222]     The exact swipe gestures (and more generally, input modalities) used to invoke
notifications screen 530, search screen 560, and control screen 570 may vary in different
embodiments. For example, in some embodiments notifications screen 530 and control
                                                 58

                                                                                          1002141603
screen 570 may be invoked in opposite fashion than that illustrated by FIG. 5I. That is, it is
possible for a downward swipe from the top edge (e.g., 546) to invoke control screen 570 and
for an upward swipe from the bottom edge (e.g., 548) to invoke notifications screen 530. In
yet other embodiments, device 100 may differentiate swipe gestures based on whether a
swipe is made from an edge of the touch-sensitive display. That is, it is possible for device
100 to display notifications screen 530 in response to a downward swipe that is from the top
edge of the touch-sensitive display, but to display search screen 560 in response to a
downward swipe that originates within the perimeter of the touch-sensitive display. The
incorporation of continuity affordances into one or more of these pervasive screens can
beneficially promote the accessibility of continuity features throughout the operating
environment.
[00223]      FIGS. 5J-5L illustrates additional placements of continuity affordances in various
user interfaces. In FIG. 5J, laptop 599 is in a user-interface locked state and requires the
entry of a password to unlock. Laptop 599 may be device 300 in some embodiments. In
addition to password entry field 574, lock screen 576 includes continuity affordance 578. In
the illustrated example, continuity affordance 578 is located at the top right comer of lock
screen 576, where notification messages are also displayed. In some embodiments, a user
may invoke continuity features by entering a proper password into password input field 574
and clicking on continuity affordance 578. That is, in response to receiving a valid password
and a mouse-event (e.g., click) on continuity affordance 578, device 599 may unlock and
launch an application corresponding to an active application of an in-range device. In some
embodiments (not illustrated in FIG. 5J), continuity affordance 578 is located in the password
input field 574. In some embodiments (not illustrated in FIG. 5J), lock screen 576 includes a
thumbnail image indicating the application that would be launched if continuity affordance
578 is invoked. In some embodiments, after unlocking, laptop 599 asks the user for
confirmation before launching the corresponding application.
[00224]      As also shown in FIG. 5J, laptop 599 may be unlocked and may display desktop
screen 580. Desktop screen 580 may have dock area 582. Dock area 582 may have icons
for launching applications. Dock area 582 may also include continuity affordance 584 for
launching an application using continuity functionalities. In some embodiments, continuity
affordance 584 permanently resides in area 582. In some embodiments, continuity
affordance 584 is inserted into dock area 582 when a compatible device comes within range
                                                59

                                                                                        1002141603
of laptop 599 and transmits relevant application usage data to laptop 599. Optionally,
continuity affordance 584 may bounce as it is inserted into dock area 582 to promote
visibility. In some embodiments, when displayed, continuity affordance 584 is the left-most
icon on dock area 582. In some embodiments, continuity affordance 584 is removed from
area 582 after it has been displayed for a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 8 seconds). In
response to a user selection (e.g., tap) of continuity affordance 584, laptop 599 may launch an
application based on continuity features, e.g., a different version of the messaging application
that is active on cellular phone 504 (FIG. 5A).
[00225]      An example of dock area 582 is the Dock provided by the Mac OS operating
system, made by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California. Dock area 582 may, however, take on
other visual forms in different embodiments. For example, dock area 582 may appear as a
bar across the bottom or another edge of the screen, to which icons for launching applications
can be pinned.
[00226]      As shown in FIG. 5K, desktop screen 580 displayed by laptop 599 may have
menu bar 586. Menu bar 586 may include affordance 588 for launching an application using
continuity functionality. In some embodiments, continuity affordance 588 is the right-most
icon on menu bar 586. In some embodiments, continuity affordance 588 permanently resides
on menu bar 586. In some embodiments, continuity affordance 588 is inserted into menu bar
586 when a compatible device comes within range of laptop 599 and transmits relevant
application usage data to laptop 599. Continuity affordance 588 may bounce (e.g., via an
animation) as it is inserted into menu bar 586 to promote visibility. In some embodiments,
continuity affordance 588 is removed from menu bar 586 after it has been displayed for a
predetermined amount of time (e.g., 8 seconds). In response to a user selection (e.g., tap) of
continuity affordance 588, laptop 599 may launch an application based on continuity features,
e.g., a different version of the messaging application that is active on device 504 (FIG. 5A).
[00227]      One example of menu bar 586 shown in FIG. 5K is the menu bar called "Finder"
in the Mac OS operating system, made by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California. In different
embodiments, menu bar 586 may, however, reside at different on-screen locations, meaning
that it may be located away from the top edge of the screen. For example, menu bar 586 may
appear as a bar across the bottom edge of the screen, to which a hierarchical menu for starting
application programs can be found. In such an implementation, continuity affordance 588
may appear in the lower right area of the screen, for example.
                                                 60

                                                                                         1002141603
[00228]     As also illustrated in FIG. 5K, laptop 599 may be unlocked and may display
desktop screen 590. Desktop screen 590 may have icon grid 591. Icon grid 591 may have
icons for launching applications on laptop 599. For example, icon grid 591 may have icon
592 for launching a web browsing application on device 100. Icon grid 590 may also include
continuity affordance 593 for launching an application using continuity functionality. In
response to a user selection (e.g., tap) on continuity affordance 593, laptop 599 may launch
an application based on continuity features, e.g., a different version of the messaging
application that is active on device 504 (FIG. 5A).
[00229]     As shown in FIG. 5L, laptop 599 may display a task-switching user interface
(task-switcher) 594 for switching between different applications that are executing on laptop
599. Task-switcher 594 includes affordances representing active applications. As shown,
task-switcher 594 may include affordances 596 representing an application that is active in
the foreground of laptop 599. Task-switcher 594 also may include affordances 597
representing background applications on laptop 599. Task-switcher 594 also may include
continuity affordance 595 for launching an application using continuity functionality. In
some embodiments, continuity affordance 595 is the left-most affordance on task-switcher
594. In some embodiments, continuity affordance 595 is the right-most affordance on task
switcher 594.
[00230]     In some embodiments, laptop 599 displays task-switcher 594 in response to a
command-tab input from the user. In some embodiments, laptop 599 displays task-switcher
594 in response to a keystroke or keystroke combination, such as an alternate-tab input from
the user. In some embodiments, laptop 599 displays task-switcher 594 in response to the
placement of the mouse cursor at a corner (e.g., lower right) of the screen. A user may select
continuity affordance 595 to invoke continuity functionality. In some embodiments, a user
may press the tab key repeatedly while holding the command key (or alternate key) to
traverse through the displayed affordances to reach continuity affordance 595. In response to
each press of the tab key, laptop 599 may highlight (or otherwise visually emphasize) a
different affordance in task-switcher 594. When continuity affordance 595 is visually
highlighted, the user may release the command key (or alternate key) to select continuity
affordance 595. In response to the user selection, laptop 599 may launch an application
based on continuity features, e.g., a different version of the messaging application that is
active on device 504 (FIG. 5A).
                                                 61

                                                                                          1002141603
[00231]      Also as shown in FIG. 5L, laptop 599 may be unlocked and may show desktop
screen 581. When laptop 599 receives application usage information from a compatible
electronic device that is within communications range, laptop 599 may display notification
message 583. A user may select (e.g., click on) notification message 583 to launch an
application that corresponds to the active application that is executing on the in-range,
compatible electronic device.
[00232]      In some embodiments, a device can "push" an application onto another device.
FIGS. 5M-5N illustrate exemplary user interfaces illustrating this "push" technique according
to some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 5M, cellular phone 504 is executing messaging
application 511. In addition, device 199 (which may be device 100 or device 300 in some
embodiments) is within communications range of cellular phone 504. Cellular phone 504
may display affordance 513 for pushing messaging application 511 onto device 199. In
response to a user selection of "yes" in affordance 513, cellular phone 504 sends information
(e.g., instructions) to device 199 identifying messaging application 511. Cellular phone 504
may also send state information regarding messaging application 511, such information
identifying the particular the message transcript that is being displayed. As shown in FIG.
5N, in some embodiments, continuity affordance 519 appears on device 199, and may be
selected by a user to launch a corresponding messaging application. In some embodiments
(not shown), device 199 may automatically launch a corresponding messaging application
after it receives the identifying information from cellular phone 504. In some embodiments,
a confirmation message 517 is displayed on cellular phone 504 that a push instruction has
been sent to device 199.
[00233]      FIGS. 17A-17E depict additional exemplary user interfaces related to the "push"
technique according to some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 17A, wearable electronic
device 1704, worn by user 1702, may obtain and display web page 1706. Wearable
electronic device 1704 may be device 460 (FIG. 4C) in some embodiments. Due to its form
factor, wearable electronic device 1704 may default to displaying a relatively small portion of
web page 1706 to improve readability. Sometimes, a user may however wish to see larger
portions of the web page.
[00234]      Attention is now directed how the user may view a larger portion of web page
1706, at a compatible device, in this situation. As shown in FIG. 17B, when user 1702 walks
within wireless communication range of tablet computer 1708, device 1704 may
                                                62

                                                                                       1002141603
communicate with tablet computer 1708 and determine that the two devices are compatible
for purposes of continuity. As depicted in FIG. 17C, user 1702 user may touch the touch
sensitive display of wearable electronic device 1704 (as indicated by contact 1710) while web
page 1706 is displayed to invoke menu 1711. Menu 1711 may include affordances for
invoking different features of device 1704, including affordance 1712 for invoking continuity
features between wearable electronic device 1704 and tablet computer 1708.
[00235]     In some embodiments, wearable electronic device 1704 may require contact 1710
to be a contact on the touch-sensitive display that has a maximum intensity exceeding a
threshold intensity. Restated, if the maximum intensity of contact 1710 does not exceed the
threshold, device 1704 may invoke another feature, such as a feature to obtain and display
another web page, for example if the position of selection 1710 corresponds to a web page
hyperlink.
[00236]     Turning to FIG. 17D with reference to FIG. 17C, when user 1702 selects
affordance 1712 (as indicated by contact 1714), wearable electronic device 1704 may send
information (e.g., instructions) to tablet computer 1708 identifying the web browsing
application that is active in the foreground of wearable electronic 1704. Wearable electronic
device 1704 may also send to tablet computer 1708 an indication of the web page that is
being displayed, e.g., web page 1706. In some embodiments, confirmation message 1715 is
displayed on wearable electronic device 1704 to indicate that a push instruction has been sent
to the external device. The external device-tablet computer 1708-may display continuity
affordance 1716 upon obtaining the instructions.
[00237]     Turning to FIG. 17E, when user 1702 selects affordance 1716, such as by swiping
the affordance in the up direction, tablet computer 1708 launches an application that
corresponds to the web browser running on wearable electronic device 460. For example,
tablet computer 1708 may launch Safari® by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California.
Optionally, when launched, the application may display web page 1706. Also optionally,
when launched, the application may display web page 1706 such that the (smaller) portion
displayed on wearable electronic device 1704 is part of the (larger) portion displayed on
tablet computer 1708. Because tablet computer 1708 has a larger display screen than
wearable electronic device 460, a larger portion of web page 1706 may be displayed at once.
                                                63

                                                                                            1002141603
[00238]     FIGS. 18A-1 8D depict additional exemplary user interfaces related to the "push"
technique according to some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 18A, wearable electronic
device 1804, worn by user 1802, may display alert 1806. Wearable electronic device 1804
may be device 460 in some embodiments. Alert 1806 may be a message informing the user
of incoming application data. The incoming application data is a message in the illustrated
examples. Alerts may be useful in alerting the user to the availability of new application data
when the corresponding application for processing the data is not executing in the foreground
of the device. While it is possible for user 1802 to view the incoming message on wearable
electronic device 1804, sometimes, the user may prefer to view the body of the message on a
larger, external computing device.
[00239]     Attention is now directed to how user 1804 may do so. Turning to FIG. 18B,
when a compatible external device is available, a user may invoke continuity functionality by
touching and sliding alert 1806 in a particular direction, such as to the left or to the right, via
touch input 1808. In response, wearable electronic device 1804 may send information (e.g.,
instructions) to the nearby device that identifies the incoming message. Turning to FIG. 18C,
in some embodiments, wearable electronic device 1804 displays confirmation message 1810
to indicate that a push instruction has been sent to an external device. After obtaining the
instruction, the external device-tablet computer 1812-may display continuity affordance
1814.
[00240]     As shown in FIG. 18C, a user may invoke continuity features on tablet computer
1812 by selecting affordance 1814 (e.g., by sliding the affordance upwards). In response to
the selection of affordance 1814, device 1812 may launch an application for viewing
incoming message 1822 corresponding to alert 1806 (FIG. 18A). When launched, the
application displays incoming message 1822 on the screen of tablet computer 1812.
Messages by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California is an exemplary application that may be
launched in this situation to view a copy of incoming message 1822.
[00241]     It should be understood that device 199 (FIGS. 5M-5N), device 1708 (FIGS. 17A
17E), device 1812 (FIGS. 18A-18D), and/or device 1910 (FIGS. 19A-19C) may display
affordances for invoking continuity features in various ways. For example, any one of the
exemplary user interfaces for displaying continuity affordances illustrated in FIGS. 5C-5L
may be used.
                                                 64

                                                                                           1002141603
3.       Correspondence between applications
[00242]     Attention is now directed to correspondence between applications that may be
invoked using continuity features, with reference to FIGS. 6A and 6B. FIG. 6A illustrates the
use of continuity functionality to launch, on one device, a different version of an application
that is executing on another device. As shown in FIG. 6A, cellular phone 504 is executing a
web browser application that is displaying web-page 602. Cellular phone 504 is in
communications range of tablet computer 512, and transmits application usage data
identifying the active web browser application and web-page 602 to tablet computer 512.
When a user invokes continuity features on tablet computer 512, the tablet launches its own
version of the web browser application showing the same web-page 602. That is, in this
example, two applications are considered to be corresponding if they are different versions of
the same application. In some embodiments, cellular phone 504 may be executing Safari®
for iPhone and tablet computer 512 may be executing Safari for iPad@. In some
embodiments, tablet computer 512 may be executing a portable document editor while
cellular phone 504 may be executing a portable document viewer.
[00243]     FIG. 6B illustrates the use of continuity functionality to launch, on one device, an
application that is different but related to an application that is executing (or recently
executed) on another device. One example of related applications is companion applications.
For example, if a music-management application 604 (e.g., iTunes@ by Apple Inc. of
Cupertino, California) is playing a song on laptop 599 when a user invokes continuity
functionality from cellular phone 504, cellular phone 504 may launch a music-player 606 to
play the same song. Another example of related applications is an application that controls
another. For example, if a music-player application is executing on laptop 599 when
continuity is invoked on cellular phone 504, cellular phone 504 may launch a remote control
having transport controls for controlling the music-player that is active on laptop 599.
[00244]     Attention is now directed to continuity of application states. The "state" of an
application as used here refers to a mode or a condition of an application. Exemplary
application states include the condition of showing a particular screen, a mode or
configuration setting in which the application is operating, the condition of displaying a
particular location within a navigational hierarchy of the application, the condition of
displaying a particular part of or location within a document, and so forth.
                                                 65

                                                                                            1002141603
[00245]      Referring back to FIG. 5B, when cellular phone 504 communicates with tablet
computer 512, cellular phone 504 may transmit to tablet computer 512 certain usage data.
The usage data may indicate the state of an active application on cellular phone 504, such as
the messaging application. The receiving tablet computer 512 may use this information to
launch a corresponding application in the same application state. For example, if the user is
viewing a particular message transcript on cellular phone 504 when continuity is invoked on
tablet computer 512, tablet computer 512 may launch a corresponding messaging application
and display the same the same messages transcript. If the messages transcript is sufficiently
lengthy to require scrolling, tablet computer 512 may display the messages transcript at the
same scrolling position based on position information provided by the usage data.
[00246]      In instances where the active application of cellular phone 504 is presenting
information from particular position in a navigational hierarchy of the application (e.g., a
particular screen or sub-screen within the application), when continuity is invoked on tablet
computer 512, tablet computer 512 may display the same application screen or sub-screen.
For instance, if cellular phone 504 is displaying a screen for configuring advanced messaging
settings, tablet computer 512 may display the same configuration screen when a user invokes
continuity from tablet computer 512. Put another way, display states may also survive
continuity.
[00247]      In instances where the active application of cellular phone 504 is in a particular
mode when continuity is invoked on tablet computer 512, tablet computer 512 may launch
the corresponding application in the same mode. For instance, if cellular phone 504 is
playing a video in (i) landscape orientation, (ii) at a 16:9 aspect ratio, (iii) with audio muted,
and (iv) closed captioning enabled when continuity is invoked on tablet computer 512, tablet
computer 512 may launch a corresponding video player playing the same video from the
same position with settings (i)-(iv).
[00248]      Attention is now directed to using continuity features to invoke applications that
are associated with points-of-interests, with reference to FIGS. 6C and 6D. FIG. 6C
illustrates the use of continuity functionality to launch an application that is associated with
an electronic point-of-interest. For example, the electronic point-of-interest may be a
household electronics device, such as a smart-television. The household electronics device
may emit a wireless signal that communicates its identity to cellular phone 504. When a user
invokes continuity functionality from cellular phone 504, cellular phone 504 may use this
                                                 66

                                                                                           1002141603
information to launch an application for controlling the smart television. The application
may be, for instance, a smart-television controller 610. FIG. 6D illustrates the use continuity
techniques to launch an application associated with a physical point-of-interest. For example,
cellular phone 504 may be within a designated range of a landmark, such as the Statue of
Liberty. If continuity functionality is invoked on cellular phone 504 in this situation, cellular
phone 504 may launch an application 612 describing the Statue and its history. In some
embodiments, physical proximity between cellular phone 504 and the landmark may be
determined based on GPS readings from the cellular phone 504 and known coordinates of the
landmark (e.g., from a map). In some embodiments, cellular phone 504 can obtain and
account for locational broadcasts made on behalf of the landmark, such as signals received
from Wi-Fi "beacons" that are broadcasting location information of the landmark.
[00249]      Sometimes, cellular phone 504 may be within wireless communication range of
point-of-interest for which an application is available on the internet, but the application is
not yet installed onto cellular phone 504. For example, a user may carry cellular phone 504
into a coffee shop that offers a mobile ordering and/or payment application that has not been
previously installed on the cellular phone. In some embodiments, if a user invokes continuity
functionality on cellular phone 504 in this situation, cellular phone 504 may display an
affordance for downloading and installing the relevant application. In this way, a user may
instruct cellular phone 504 to obtain the relevant application by simply selecting (e.g.,
tapping) the affordance. In some embodiments, if a user invokes continuity functionality on
cellular phone 504 in this situation, cellular phone 504 may direct the user to an intermediate
source of information for the point-of-interest-    such as a web-page-    so that the user may
make a more informed decision as to whether to install an application associated with the
point-of-interest. In these situations, cellular phone 504 may obtain a deep link and display
or access the deep link for further user consideration.
[00250]      Because a many-to-one relationship can exist between available applications and a
point-of-interest, cellular phone 504 may consider additional factors in determining what
application is most relevant for purposes of continuity. In some embodiments, cellular phone
504 considers the frequency of use of certain applications at a particular point-of-interest to
identify the exact application that should be launched. For example, cellular phone 504 may
find that a fitness (sometimes called workout) application and a gymnasium membership
application are both associated with the user's gym. Device 100 may further determine that
                                                 67

                                                                                        1002141603
the user more frequently accesses the workout application while he is at the gym. In response
to this determination, device 100 may launch the workout application when the user invokes
continuity functionality on cellular phone 504 upon arrival at the gym.
[00251]     In some embodiments, cellular phone 504 considers the time of day to identify the
exact application that should be launched. For example, cellular phone 504 may find that a
train schedule application and a news application are both frequently accessed while a user is
waiting at a commuter train stop. Cellular phone 504 may further determine that the user
tends to access the news application in the mornings while waiting at the train station. In
response to this determination, cellular phone 504 may launch the news application if a user
invokes continuity features in the morning upon arrival to the train station.
[00252]     In some embodiments, cellular phone 504 considers other contextual information
to identify the exactly application that should be launched. For example, cellular phone 504
may find that an in-car entertainment application is frequently used when the GPS sensors of
the phone indicate that the device is moving at speed, and the RF circuitry of cellular phone
504 indicates that the device is connected to a Bluetooth device named "CAR MEDIA."
Thus, when a user invokes continuity functionality on cellular phone 504 in this situation,
cellular phone 504 may launch the in-car entertainment application in response.
[00253]     Additional techniques for determining relationships between applications may be
found in the following co-pending provisional applications: U.S. Patent Application Serial
No. 62/005,781, "ACTIVITY CONTINUATION BETWEEN ELECTRONIC DEVICES,"
filed May 30, 2014; U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 62/005,793, "COMPANION

[00254]     Attention is now directed to using continuity features in combination with voice
based intelligent automated assistant features, with reference to FIGS. 19A-19C. Siri,     made
by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California, is an exemplary intelligent automated assistant.
Intelligent automated assistant techniques are also described in, for example, U.S. Utility
                                                68

                                                                                        1002141603
Application Serial No. 12/987,982 for "Intelligent Automated Assistant," filed January 10,
2011, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
[00255]     As shown in FIG. 19A, user 1902 may provide verbal command 1903 to wearable
electronic device 1904. Wearable electronic device 1904 may be device 460 (FIG. 4C) in
some embodiments. Verbal command 1903 may be a request for directions to a nearby
coffee shop. In some embodiments, after receiving verbal command 1903, wearable
electronic device 1904 may send information indicative of the verbal command to an external
device that is in-range, in this example cellular phone 1910. Cellular phone 1910 maybe
device 100 (FIG. 1) in some embodiments.
[00256]     In response to receiving instructions from wearable electronic device 1902,
cellular phone 1910 may display affordance 1912 for invoking continuity features. When a
user invokes continuity via affordance 1912 (e.g., by way of a swipe gesture as shown in FIG.
19B), cellular phone 1910 may display information that have been obtained in response to
verbal command 1906. In the illustrated example, cellular phone 1910 displays turn-by-turn
navigation 1914 to a nearby coffee shop in response to command 1903.
[00257]      The information sent by wearable electronic device 1904 to external device
(cellular phone) 1910 may include data representing verbal command 1906, in some
examples. The information sent by device wearable electronic 1904 to external device
(cellular phone) 1910 may include data representing a web service for obtaining information
responsive to verbal command 1906, in some examples. The information sent by wearable
electronic device 1904 to external device (cellular phone) 1910 may include data representing
information obtained in response to verbal command 1906, in some examples.
[00258]     These examples serve to illustrate that while the division of labor between
wearable electronic device 1904 and external device 1910 with respect to processing and
providing intelligent automated responses may vary between embodiments, each of the
embodiments may still permit a user to choose between obtaining intelligent automated
responses on one or more of the involved devices at his choosing. It is particularly helpful to
a user to be able to query the assistant using a highly portable device (e.g., wearable
electronic device 1904) and later decide whether to receive the assistant's response on the
same device and/or on a compatible external device (e.g., cellular phone 1910) as one of the
                                                69

                                                                                         1002141603
two devices may have audio/visual capabilities (e.g., speakers, larger/high-resolution screens)
that are be better suited for presenting the resulting response.
[00259]     As an example, as shown in FIG. 19C, wearable electronic device 1904 may
display turn-by-turn directions 1914 after receiving verbal command 1906, in some
embodiments. However the amount of information displayed at one time may be limited by
the form-factor of wearable electronic device 1904. A more complete view of turn-by-turn
directions 1914 may be displayed by cellular phone 1910 if a user elects continuity features
on cellular phone 1910, as cellular phone 1910 is equipped with a larger display screen. In
this way, a user may conveniently invoke voice assistant functionality through one device
and, as desired, use one or both devices to review the information provided by the voice
assistant.
4.      Disambiguation
[00260]     Situations may arise in which a device is unable to determine, definitively, what
application should be launched based on incoming data, historical data, and/or contextual
information. This situation may be provoked by multiple external devices being within range
of the device. Consider FIG. 7A, which illustrates a first external device 702 executing a
messaging application 704 and a second external device 706 executing a web browsing
application 708. A user is interacting with both devices in that he is intermittently texting
while web browsing. Both devices are within range of tablet computer 710. Both devices are
also wirelessly transmitting usage data regarding applications 704 and 708 to tablet computer
710. In this situation, tablet computer 710 may be unable to determine which of the two
applications is actually more relevant to the user.
[00261]     In some embodiments, tablet computer 710 may identify the more recently used
application as the more relevant application for purposes of continuity. That is, if the user
last accessed messaging application 704 six seconds ago but last accessed web browser 708
ten seconds ago, when continuity is invoked on tablet computer 710, tablet computer 710
launches a corresponding messaging application because messaging application 704 was
more recently by the user. Optionally, tablet computer 710 may display a thumbnail
representation of the messaging application in continuity affordance 714 to indicate the
application that will be launched.
                                                 70

                                                                                          1002141603
[00262]     This treatment, however, may not always be appropriate. For instance, the user
may rather focus on web browsing on the larger tablet computer 710. In some embodiments,
when faced with this situation, tablet computer 710 may display additional information to
permit the user to provide an informed selection of the application to launch. For instance,
tablet computer 710 may display more than one continuity affordance on lock screen 712 to
indicate the availability of multiple applications to continue from. As shown in FIG. 7B,
tablet computer 710 may show affordances 714 and 716 to signal the need for user selection
between the two.
[00263]     FIGS. 7C-7E illustrate how tablet computer 710 may respond to a selection (e.g.,
tap) of the group of affordances 714 and 716. In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 7C,
when tablet computer 710 receives a user input (e.g., tap) at the group of affordances, tablet
computer 710 visually ungroups the affordances and translates the affordances on-screen so
that they are appropriately spaced for individual selection using a touch object. The
ungrouping may involve visually translating affordances 714 and 716 from their grouped
position to their ungrouped positions. In response to a user selection (e.g., swipe or tap) of
continuity affordance 714, tablet computer 710 may launch a messaging application
corresponding to that of device 702. In response to a user selection of continuity affordance
716, tablet computer 710 may launch a web browsing application corresponding to that of
device 706.
[00264]     In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 7D, tablet computer 710 displays
disambiguation screen 718 when a user selects continuity affordance 714 or 716.
Disambiguation screen 718 may display 22 may display continuity affordance 714 or 716 for
individual selection. In response to a user selection (e.g., swipe or tap) of continuity
affordance 714, tablet computer 710 may launch a messaging application corresponding to
that of device 702. In response to a user selection of continuity affordance 716, tablet
computer 710 may launch a web browsing application corresponding to that of device 706.
[00265]     In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 7E, tablet computer 710 displays
disambiguation screen 720. Disambiguation screen 720 may organize, by categories, the
applications that are available for launching through continuity functionality. The
categorization of applications may be based on the relationship between the available
applications, and those applications executing on external devices. For example,
corresponding applications that are different versions of applications executing on external
                                                71

                                                                                       1002141603
devices may be placed under one category 722, while related (e.g., companion) applications
may be placed under another category 724. In addition, applications that are displayed due to
the device's proximity to a point-of-interest may be displayed as yet another category of
applications 726.
[00266]      In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 7F, tablet computer 710 displays
disambiguation screen 730. Disambiguation screen 730 may organize, into tabbed lists, the
applications that are available for launching through continuity functionality. The separation
of applications across tabs may be based on the relationship between the available
applications and those that are executing on external devices. Tab headings may identify the
relationship. Affordances for launching applications within each category (tab) are displayed
when the tab to which they belong is selected. For example, affordances for invoking
corresponding applications are displayed under tab 732, while affordances for invoking
related (e.g., companion) applications are displayed under tab 734.
[00267]      In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 7G, tablet computer 710 displays
disambiguation screen 740. Disambiguation screen 740 may list applications corresponding
to each compatible external device that is within communications range. As shown,
disambiguation screen 740 includes heading 742 representing a first external device (e.g., 702
in FIG. 7A). Disambiguation screen 740 also includes heading 744 representing a second
external device (e.g., 706 in FIG. 7A). Disambiguation screen 740 also includes heading 745
representing a third external device. Tablet computer 710 also displays, under each heading,
affordances representing applications that correspond to those executing (and/or has
executed) on the respective external device.
[00268]      As shown in FIG. 7G, affordances 746, 748, and 750 represent corresponding
versions of three applications that are executing (and/or have executed) on external device
702. Optionally, the ordering of affordances 746, 748, and 750 may reflect how recently
each application was used by the user relative to one another. Likewise, affordances listed
together with heading 744 represent corresponding versions of applications that are executing
(and/or have executed) on external device 706. Screen 740 may be scrollable in the one
direction (e.g., horizontal) to reveal additional external devices. Screen 740 may be
scrollable in another direction (e.g., vertical) to more application affordances.
                                                  72

                                                                                         1002141603
[00269]     In some embodiments, disambiguation screen 740 may include a "favorites"
heading (not shown). Tablet computer 710 may display, under this "favorites" heading,
affordances showing applications that have been designated by a user as favorites. In some
embodiments, tablet computer 710 may organize this information into tabbed lists (not
shown). Such a tabbed list may appear similar to the tabbed list illustrated in FIG. 7F,
meaning that applications corresponding to each external device may be displayed under a
tab.
[00270]     It is noted that when an application is launched in the manner described with
respect to FIGS. 7A-7G, device 710 may place the continuing application into the same
application state as the corresponding application on the external device, as discussed above.
[00271]     Notably, the user interfaces described by FIGS. 7A-7G provide users with
powerful ways of cataloging their application use across multiple electronics devices, and to
transition between uses of those applications seamlessly. Consider, for example, a situation
in which one user owns a compatible cellular phone, tablet computer, and laptop computer.
A user interface screen modeled after disambiguation screen 740 (FIG. 7G) would provide a
particularly powerful way for the user to transition between the different devices, depending
on which device is best suited to a particular task, by presenting the user with the universe of
possible open (and optionally closed) applications to continue from.
5.       Improved wireless communication techniques
[00272]     In some embodiments, wireless communication, for purposes of continuity
functionality, occur over a peer-to-peer wireless communication protocol such as Bluetooth
and/or Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE). In some embodiments, wireless communication for
purposes of continuity functionality utilizes more than one wireless communication protocol.
For example, WiFi may be used in addition to BTLE. In these embodiments, an initial
communication between two devices may occur over a lower powered protocol, such as
BTLE, even if the protocol yields a slower data transfer speed. Subsequent communications
may occur over a secondary network that is relatively faster, such as WiFi.
[00273]     As an example, a laptop computer may obtain, over BTLE, usage information
indicating that an in-range iPhone@ is being used to draft an e-mail message. When a user
invokes e-mail continuity on the laptop computer, the two devices may communicate over
WiFi to transmit application data including portions of the draft e-mail and accompany
                                                73

                                                                                          1002141603
attachments, so that the user may continue drafting on the laptop without a loss of progress.
Through this bifurcated approach, devices may poll for other compatible devices that are in
range without placing unduly power requirements on the devices' power systems. The
reduced power consumption rates may also permit more frequent polling rates. At the same
time, a faster channel is reserved for data intensive communications such as the
communication of application data and/or application state information.
[00274]     In some embodiments, usage information that is transmitted over the slower
communication protocol includes device authentication information. The authentication
information may include a token or other identifier that is calculated (e.g., hashed) at least in
part based on a user ID. In some examples, the user ID is an e-mail address. In some
embodiments, the user ID is an iCloud ID offered by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California,
which may be in turn be associated with an e-mail address. Two compatible devices may
decide to permit or deny the use of continuity functionalities based on (at least in part)
whether the devices are associated with the same user ID. In this way, privacy between
devices owned by different (but physically proximate) users can be maintained, meaning that
continuity between different users' devices can be prevented (or permitted) as desired.
[00275]     In some embodiments, a device may further conserve power by permitting a user
to designate how much continuity information should be automatically obtained from a
compatible device that is within wireless communication range. In these embodiments, the
device may receive, over a lower-powered peer-to-peer communication protocol, initial
information identifying one or more compatible devices. In response to detecting the external
devices and the initial information, the device may display a continuity affordance that
informs the user as to the potential availability of continuity features. However, the displayed
continuity affordance may have a visual appearance indicating that continuity features have
not been fully enabled. In particular, the device may refrain from obtaining additional usage
and/or application data information from the compatible devices until the device receives a
user's instruction to do so. The user may do so by selecting (e.g., tapping) on the displayed
affordance. In response to the user selection, the device may obtain additional usage and/or
application data information that would permit the device to launch a corresponding
application in a proper application state. In addition, the device may update the visual
appearance of the affordance to indicate that continuity with the compatible device is now
enabled and may thus be invoked from the device (e.g., by a swipe).
                                                 74

                                                                                          1002141603
[00276]      This power conservation technique is illustrated in FIGS. 8A-8C. In FIG. 8A,
device 504 and device 199 are within communications range and are compatible for purposes
of continuity. While the two devices are in range, device 199 initially receives a first portion
of usage information from device 504 indicating its presence and support for continuity
functionality. This initial communication 801 may occur over a low powered communication
protocol such as BTLE. In response to receiving this first portion of usage information,
device 199 displays continuity affordance 802 having a disabled appearance. A user may
select (e.g., tap) affordance 802 to enable further communication 803 between the devices for
purposes of continuity. Turning to FIG. 8B, in response to the user selection of affordance
802, device 199 obtains an additional, second portion of usage information from device 504.
The additional usage information may indicate, among other things, the use of messaging
application 804 on device 504, as well as the state of messaging application 804. Also,
device 199 may change the visual appearance of affordance 802 so that it appears enabled.
Optionally, device 199 may include a thumbnail image indicative of application 804 with
affordance 802. As shown in FIG. 8C, a user may then swipe or otherwise activate
affordance 802 to launch a corresponding application on device 199.
[00277]      FIG. 9 is a flow diagram illustrating process 900 for transitioning between two
electronic devices. Process 900 may be performed at an electronic device with a display and
a touch-sensitive surface, like device 100 (FIG. 1), device 300 (FIG. 3), device 460 (FIG.
4C), and device 470 (FIG. 4D). At block 902, the device detects, via wireless
communication, an external device. The external device is executing or has executed a first
application. At block 904, the device receives from the external device usage information
indicating usage of the first application on the external device. Optionally, the usage
information includes usage statistics on when and how recently the first application as used.
Optionally, the usage information indicates the state of the first application. At block 906, in
response to detecting the external device and receiving the usage information, the device
displays an affordance on its screen. Optionally, at block 906, the device may determine how
long the affordance has been displayed and cease to display the affordance after a
predetermined amount of time. At block 908, the device receives input data representing user
selection of the displayed affordance. At block 910, in response to receiving the input data,
the device launches a second application on the electronic device, the second application
corresponding to the first application. In some embodiments, the second application may
correspond to the first application in that the second application is a different version of the
                                                 75

                                                                                         1002141603
first application. In some embodiments, the second application may correspond to the first
application in that both applications have at least one application feature in common. For
example, both applications may be able to view a particular type of presentation file. In some
embodiments, the second application may correspond to the first application in that the
second application is a companion to the first and/or the second application provides features
for controlling the operation of the first application. Optionally, when the device launches the
second application, the device also places the second application into the same application
state as the first application.
[00278]      In some embodiments (e.g., touchscreen embodiments), the device that is
performing process 900 has a touch screen display and a touch-sensitive surface is on the
display. In some embodiments (e.g., non-touchscreen embodiments), the device has a display
separate from the touch-sensitive surface. Thus, the appearance of continuity affordance 514
displayed at block 908 may be different. For example, in touchscreen embodiments, the
displayed affordance may look like those illustrated in FIGS. 5C-5I, FIGS. 7A-7G, and/or
FIGS. 8A-8C. In non-touchscreen embodiments, the displayed affordance may look like
those illustrated in FIGS. 5J-5L. The exact user input that the device is responsive to during
block 910 may also be different. For example, in touchscreen embodiments, the displayed
affordances may be responsive to touch input using a touch object, such as a tap, a long
duration touch, a flick, a swipe, or another applicable touch gesture. In non-touchscreen
embodiments, the displayed affordances may be responsive to mouse events generated using
a mouse or equivalent input device, such as a click, double click, drag, and so forth.
Combinations of the embodiments are possible. For example, a touchscreen device can be
responsive to an external wireless mouse, thus devices in the touchscreen embodiments can
also be responsive to mouse and mouse cursor input techniques. Likewise, a non-touchscreen
device can be responsive to a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touchpad), thus devices of the
non-touchscreen embodiments can also be responsive to touch input. Put another way, it is
entirely possible for a tablet computer to display one of screens illustrated in FIG. 5J-5L and
to launch an application using continuity functionality in response to a wireless
keyboard/mouse input. Likewise, it is entirely possible for a laptop computer to also have a
touch-sensitive display and therefore be able to provide the screens illustrated in FIGS. 5C
5I, FIGS. 7A-7G, and/or FIGS. 8A-8C and respond to both keyboard, mouse, and touch
input. Other combinations are also possible.

[00289]      FIG. 10 is a flow diagram illustrating process 1000 of transitioning between two
electronic devices. Process 1000 may be performed at an electronic device with a display and
a touch-sensitive surface, like device 100 (FIG. 1), device 300 (FIG. 3), and device 460 (FIG.
4C). At block 1002, the device detects, via wireless communication, an external device. The
external device is executing or has executed a first application. At block 1004, the device
receives from the external device usage information indicating usage of the first application
on the external device. This usage information may be received using a first wireless
communication protocol. At block 1006, the device receives from the external device
application data of the first application. This usage information may be received using a
second wireless communication protocol different from the first. At block 1008, in response
to detecting the external device and the information received in blocks 1004 and 1006, the
device displays a continuity affordance. Optionally, at block 1008, the device may determine
how long the affordance has been displayed and cease to display the affordance after a

[00290]      In some embodiments, the usage information received at block 1004 is received
over a lower-powered wireless communication protocol and the information received at block
1006 is received over a higher-powered wireless communication protocol. The lower
powered wireless communication protocol may have a lower bandwidth and/or slower data
transfer rate, meaning that the lower-powered wireless communication protocol has a lower
data transfer capacity. In some embodiments, the lower-powered wireless communication
protocol is a peer-to-peer protocol and the higher-powered wireless communication protocol
is a local-area-network protocol. In some embodiments, the lower-powered wireless
                                                 81

                                                                                          1002141603
communication protocol is the Bluetooth or Bluetooth Low Energy protocol, and the higher
powered wireless communication protocol is a IEEE 802.1 1x WiFi protocol.
[00291]      The division of labor between communications under the first and second wireless
communication protocols may vary. Restated, if the device needs to receive a certain
universe of information in order to provide continuity functionalities, how much of that
universe of information is transmitted over the first, as opposed to the second wireless
communication protocol may vary between embodiments and/or may vary within particular
embodiments based on factors such as remaining batter life on the device. In some
embodiments, device authentication information is transmitted over the first wireless
communication protocol. In some embodiments, device-identifying information, is
transmitted over the first wireless communication protocol, while application data, such as
the contents of a draft e-mail, is transmitted over the second wireless communication
protocol. Device-identifying information may be a Bluetooth token, a user ID such as an
Apple iCloud@ ID, or an e-mail address, for example.

[00293]      FIG. 11 is a flow diagram illustrating process 1100 for transitioning between two
electronic devices. Process 1100 may be performed at an electronic device with a display and
a touch-sensitive surface, like device 100 (FIG. 1), device 300 (FIG. 3), device 460 (FIG.
4C). At block 1102, the device detects proximity between itself and a point-of-interest. At
block 1104, the device determines whether the proximity is within a threshold range. At
block 1106, in accordance with the determination that the proximity is within the threshold
range, the device displays an affordance on a screen. At block 1108, the device receives
input data representing selection of the displayed affordance. At block 1110, in response to
                                                 82

                                                                                          1002141603
receiving the input data, the device launches an application on the electronic device
associated with the point-of-interest.
[00294]     In some embodiments, the device is locked at block 1102 and unlocks at block
1110. The point-of-interest may be electronic or may be a physical landmark having
electronic devices that identify its location. When the point-of-interest is an electronic
device, at block 1110, the device may launch an application for controlling the electronic
point-of-interest. For example, if the point-of-interest is a smart television, at block 1110, a
remote control application for the television may be launched. When the point-of-interest is a
physical landmark, at block 1110, the device may launch an application that is related to the
landmark. For example, the device may launch, at block 1110, a tourist pamphlet for the
landmark.
[00295]     Optionally, at block 1110, device 100 may consider other factors in determining
what application to launch. As discussed above, device 100 may consider contextual
information such as time and frequency of access in determining what application to launch.
Also, as discussed above, device 100 may find that the desired application is not yet installed.
In these instances, device 100 may proceed to block 1112 to download, install, and launch the
application. Alternatively, device 100 may display additional information for the user to
determine if a particular application should be installed.
[00296]     FIG. 12 is a flow diagram illustrating process 1200 for selecting an application to
launch when multiple applications are available for purposes of continuity. Process 1200
may be performed at an electronic device with a display and a touch-sensitive surface, like
device 100 (FIG. 1), device 300 (FIG. 3), and/or device 460 (FIG. 4C). At block 1202, the
device detects via wireless communication, a first external device. The first external device
may be executing a first application. The first application may have a particular state. At
block 1204, the device detects, via wireless communication, a second external device distinct
from the first external device. The second external device is executing a second application.
The second application may have a particular state. At block 1206, the device displays at
least one affordance on a screen of the electronic device based on detecting the first external
device and the second external device. The displayed affordances may have the visual
appearance of, for example, the user interface screens shown in FIGS. 7A-7G. At block
1208, the device receives input data representing user selection of an affordance of the at
least one displayed affordances. Possible inputs include those described above, including
                                                83

                                                                                          1002141603
those discussed with reference to process 900 (FIG. 9). At block 1210, in response to
receiving the input data, the device launches a third application on the electronic device. The
third application may be a version of the first application or the second application.
[00297]     FIG. 13 is a flow diagram illustrating process 1300 for transitioning between two
electronic devices. Process 1300 may be performed at an electronic device with a display and
a touch-sensitive surface, like device 100 (FIG. 1), device 300 (FIG. 3), and/or device 460
(FIG. 4C). At block 1302, the device, which is executing a first application, detects an
external device via wireless communication. At block 1304, the device displays a push
affordance on-screen for instructing the external device to launch a second application
corresponding to the first application. At block 1306, the device detects a user selection of
the push affordance. At block 1308, in response to detecting the user selection, the device
sends an instruction to the external device, causing the external device to display an
affordance for launching the second application on the external device.
[00298]     FIG. 14 is a flow diagram illustrating process 1400 for transitioning between two
electronic devices. Process 1400 may be performed at an electronic device with a display and
a touch-sensitive surface, like device 100 (FIG. 1), device 300 (FIG. 3), and/or device 460
(FIG. 4C). At block 1402, the device detects via wireless communication an external device.
The external device is executing a first application. At block 1404, the device receives, from
the external device, a first part of usage information indicating the first application was used
on the external device by a user within a time interval. At block 1406, in response to
detecting the external device and receiving the first part of usage information, the device
displays an affordance on a screen of the electronic device. At block 1408, the device detects
a user selection of the displayed affordance. At block 1410, in response to detecting the user
selection, the device: (i) changes the visual appearance of the displayed affordance; and (ii)
obtains, from the external device, a second part of usage information associated with the first
application. At block 1412, the device detects a user input on the changed affordance. At
block 1414, in response to receiving the user input, the device launches a second application
on the electronic device based on at least the second part of usage information. The second
application corresponds to the first application.
[00299]     FIG. 15 is a flow diagram illustrating process 1500 for transitioning between
multiple electronic devices. Process 1500 may be performed at an electronic device with a
display and a touch-sensitive surface, like device 100 (FIG. 1), device 300 (FIG. 3), and/or
                                                 84

                                                                                              1002141603
device 460 (FIG. 4C). At block 1502, the device receives, via wireless communication from
a first external device, first data representing a first plurality of applications that are executing
and/or has executed on the first external device. At block 1504, the device displays a first
plurality of affordances representing the first plurality of applications, the plurality of
affordances including a first affordance corresponding to a first application of the first
external device. At block 1506, the device detects user selection of the first affordance. At
block 1508, in response to detecting user selection of the first affordance, the device launches
a first local application on the electronic device. The first local application is a version of the
first application.
[00300]      In addition to receiving information from a first external device, a local device
that is performing process 1500 may receiver information from a second external device.
Optionally, process 1500 may include block 1510, during which the device receives via
wireless communication from a second external device, the second data representing a second
plurality of applications that are executing and/or has executed on the second external device.
Further, at block 1512, the device may display a second plurality of affordances representing
the second plurality of applications, including a second affordance corresponding to a second
application of the second external device. Further still, at block 1514, the device may detect
user selection of the second affordance, and in response, launch a second local application on
the electronic device, wherein the local application is a version of the second application.
[00301]      It should be noted that, in some embodiments, the first and second plurality of
affordances, which represent the applications of the first and second external devices, may be
displayed together on the same screen. This user interface may have the visual appearance of
screen 740 in FIG. 7G, for example. From this screen, a user may identify the various
applications that are running on nearby devices. Also, from this screen, a user may choose to
continue his work on the local device by invoking a corresponding application on the local
device. In this way, process 1500 provide powerful ways of cataloging a user's application
use across multiple electronics devices, and permitting the user to transition from use of one
device to another seamlessly. Consider, for example, a situation in which one user owns a
compatible cellular phone, tablet computer, and laptop computer. A device performing
process 1500 to display disambiguation screen 740 (FIG. 7G) would allow the user to easily
transition between the different devices onto the local device, which may be more suitable for
the task at hand.

                                                                                          1002141603
[00302]      FIG. 20 is a flow diagram illustrating process 2000 for transitioning between two
electronic devices. In some embodiments, process 2000 may be performed at an electronic
device with a display and a touch-sensitive surface that is capable of detecting intensity of
touch contacts. In some embodiments, process 2000 may be performed at an electronic with
a display and a touch-sensitive surface that is able to determine a substitute (proxy) for the
force or pressure of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface. Exemplary devices that may
perform process 2000 include devices 100, 300, and 460 (FIGS. 1, 3, and 4C).
[00303]      At block 2002, a first touch contact is detected on the touch-sensitive display. The
first contact has a first maximum intensity. The position of first contact on the touchscreen
may correspond to an icon for launching an application on the device. At block 2004, a
determination is made as to whether the first maximum intensity exceeds a threshold
intensity. If the first maximum intensity is below the threshold intensity, processing
continues to block 2006 where the corresponding application is launched. If the first
maximum intensity is above the threshold intensity, processing proceeds to block 2005 where
a feature other than launching the corresponding application is performed. For example, in
some embodiments, a context-sensitive menu is displayed.
[00304]      At block 2008, a second contact may be detected on the touch-sensitive display,
the second contact having a second maximum intensity. At block 2010, a determination is
made as to whether the second maximum intensity exceeds a threshold intensity. If the
second maximum intensity is above the threshold intensity, processing continues to block
2012 where an instruction may be sent, via wireless communication, to an external device.
The instruction may cause the external device to display an affordance for launching a second
application on the external device corresponding to the first application. In some
embodiments, the second contact and the sending of the instruction is separated by one or
more intervening steps. For example, the user may be required to select an additional
affordance (e.g., on-screen icon) after the second contact in order for the instruction to be
sent. The additional affordance may be labeled in a way to indicate to the user that he is
about to "push" information from one electronic device to another. If the second maximum
intensity is below the threshold intensity, processing proceeds to block 2011 where a feature
other than sending the instruction launching the second application is performed. For
example, in some embodiments, a feature of the first application may be invoked.

                                                                                          1002141603
[00305]      FIG. 21 is a flow diagram illustrating process 2100 for transitioning between two
electronic devices. In some embodiments, process 2100 may be performed at an electronic
device with a display and a touch-sensitive surface, such as devices 100, 300, and 460 (FIGS.
1, 3, and 4C). An application may be installed and be executable on the device. At block
2102, while the installed application is not displayed (e.g., while the application is not active
in the foreground), application data for the installed application may be obtained. At block
2104, an alert indicative of the obtained application data may be displayed. For example, the
installed application may be Messages®, made by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California; the
obtained application data may be an incoming text message; and the alert may include text
notifying the user of the incoming text message. At block 2106, a swipe of the alert may be
detected. At block 2108, responsive to a determination that the detected movement is
substantially in a first direction, an instruction may be sent via wireless communication to the
external device. The instruction may provide information for the external device to display
an affordance for launching a second application on the external device that corresponds to
the first application. The instruction may instruct the external device to display the
affordance. As used here, an "alert" may consistent of graphical user interface objects in the
form of text and images.
[00306]      FIG. 22 is a flow diagram illustrating process 2200 for transitioning between two
electronic devices. In some embodiments, process 2200 may be performed at an electronic
device with a display and a microphone, such as devices 100, 300, and 460 (FIGS. 1, 3, and
4C). The electronic device may have an intelligent automated assistant that is responsive to
voice input received via microphone. At block 2202, voice input may be detected. The voice
input may include a verbal request for information. At block 2204, an external device that is
within wireless communications range may be detected. At block 2206, responsive at least in
part to detecting the voice input and detecting the external device, an instruction may be sent
via wireless communication to the external device. The instruction may provide information
for the external device to display an affordance for displaying the requested information. The
instruction may instruct the external device to display the affordance.
[00307]      FIG. 53 is a flow diagram illustrating process 5300 for transitioning between two
electronic devices. Process 5300 may be performed at an electronic device with a touch
sensitive display and a microphone, like device 100 (FIG. 1), device 300 (FIG. 3), device 460
(FIG. 4C), and device 470 (FIG. 4D). At block 5302, the electronic device detects a voice
                                                  87

                                                                                          1002141603
input from the microphone. The voice input includes a verbal request for information. At
block 5304, the electronic device detects, via wireless communication, an external device. At
block 5306, the electronic device, in response at least in part to detecting the voice input and
detecting the external device, sends an instruction, via wireless communication, to the
external device. The instruction causes the external device to display an affordance for
displaying the requested information.
[00308]     It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in FIGS.
9-15 and 20-22 have been described is exemplary and not intended to indicate that the
described order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of
ordinary skill in the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations described
herein. For brevity, these details are not repeated here. Additionally, it should be noted that
aspects of processes 900-1500 (FIGS. 9-15) and processes 2000-2200 (FIGS. 20-22) may be
incorporated with one another. For example, process 900 describes the receiving of input in
both touchscreen and non-touchscreen equipped devices. Touchscreen and non-touchscreen
devices may be used to perform one or more of processes 1000-1500 and 2000-2200 (FIGS.
10-15 and 20-22). Thus, the input techniques described with respect to process 900 may be
relevant to processes 1000-1500 and 2000-2200. For brevity, the permutations of user input
techniques are not repeated.
[00309]     The operations in the information processing methods described above may be
implemented by running one or more functional modules in information processing apparatus
such as general purpose processors or application specific chips. These modules,
combinations of these modules, and/or their combination with general hardware (e.g., as
described above with respect to FIGS. 1A, IB, 3, 4C, and 4D) are all included within the
scope of protection of the invention.

1608 is configured to receive data, from RF unit 1606, representing an external device that is
within wireless communications range, display a graphical user interface affordance on
touch-sensitive surface unit 1604. In some embodiments, continuity unit 1610 is configured
to parse the received data and determine a corresponding application to launch on device 1
600, as well as an application state. In some embodiments, continuity unit 1610 is also
configured to parse the received data and determine an application state so that the
corresponding application may be launched under that state. Application unit 1612 may be
configured to launch the corresponding application in the desired state.
[00311]     The functional blocks of the device 1600 are, optionally, implemented by
hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software to carry out the principles of
the various described examples. It is understood by persons of skill in the art that the
functional blocks described in FIG. 16 are, optionally, combined or separated into sub-blocks
to implement the principles of the various described examples. Therefore, the description
herein optionally supports any possible combination or separation or further definition of the
functional blocks described herein.

block diagram of an electronic device 2300 configured in accordance with the principles of
the various described embodiments. In accordance with some embodiments, the functional
blocks of electronic device 2300 are configured to perform the techniques described above.
The functional blocks of the device 2300 are, optionally, implemented by hardware, software,

time.
[00316]     In some embodiments, the first application was used on the external device within
a predetermined amount of time prior to the current time.
[00317]     In some embodiments, the first application and the second application have at

[00335]     In some embodiments, electronic device 2300 is a laptop or desktop computer.
[00336]     In some embodiments, electronic device 2300 is a tablet computer.

[00338]     In some embodiments, the external device is a laptop or desktop computer.
[00339]     In some embodiments, the external device is a tablet computer.
[00340]     In some embodiments, the external device is a phone.
[00341]     The operations described above with reference to FIG. 9 are, optionally,
implemented by components depicted in FIGS. 1A-1B or FIG. 23. For example, detecting
                                                 92

                                                                                         1002141603
operation 902, receiving operation 904, and displaying operation 906 may be implemented by
event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event
sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher module 174
delivers the event information to application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of
application 136-1 compares the event information to respective event definitions 186, and
determines whether a first contact at a first location on the touch-sensitive surface
corresponds to a predefined event or sub event, such as activation of an affordance on a user
interface. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is detected, event recognizer 180
activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the event or sub-event. Event
handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176 or object updater 177 to update the
application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a respective
GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it would be clear
to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be implemented based on
the components depicted in FIGS. lA-1B.
[00342]     In accordance with some embodiments, FIG. 24 shows an exemplary functional
block diagram of an electronic device 2400 configured in accordance with the principles of
the various described embodiments. In accordance with some embodiments, the functional
blocks of electronic device 2400 are configured to perform the techniques described above.
The functional blocks of the device 2400 are, optionally, implemented by hardware, software,

examples. It is understood by persons of skill in the art that the functional blocks described
in FIG. 34 are, optionally, combined or separated into sub-blocks to implement the principles
of the various described examples. Therefore, the description herein optionally supports any
possible combination or separation or further definition of the functional blocks described
herein.
[00566]      As shown in FIG. 34, an electronic device 3400 includes processing unit 3426
optionally coupled to display unit 3420. In some embodiments, processing unit 3426
includes an external device detecting unit 3430, a display enabling unit 3434, an input
detecting unit 3432, an application launching unit 3436, and a data receiving unit 3438.
[00567]      Processing unit 3426 is configured to: detect (e.g., with external device detecting
unit 3430), via a first communication protocol, an external device, wherein the external
device is executing or has executed a first application; receive (e.g., with data receiving unit),
from the external device, usage information indicating usage of the first application on the

                                               122

                                                                                          1002141603
screen (e.g., display unit 3420) of electronic device 3400; receive (e.g., with data receiving
unit), via a second communication protocol, application data of the first application from the
external device, the second communication protocol different from the first communication
protocol; detect (e.g., with input detecting unit 3432) a user selection of the displayed
affordance; and in response to receiving the input data: launch (e.g., with application
launching unit 3436) a second application on electronic device 3400, the second application
corresponding to the first application; and enable (e.g., with display enabling unit 3434)

protocol comprises: receiving (e.g., with data receiving unit 3438), via WiFi, the application
data associated with the first application.
[00572]      In some embodiments, the usage information includes identification data based on
an e-mail address, and processing unit 3426 is further configured to: enable (e.g., with display
enabling unit 3434) display of the affordance only if electronic device 3400 is associated with
the same e-mail address.
[00573]      The operations described above with reference to FIG. 10 are, optionally,
implemented by components depicted in FIGS. 1A-1B or FIG. 34. For example, detecting
operation 1002, receiving operation and displaying operation 1008 may be implemented by
event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event
sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher module 174
                                                123

                                                                                          1002141603
delivers the event information to application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of
application 136-1 compares the event information to respective event definitions 186, and
determines whether a first contact at a first location on the touch-sensitive surface
corresponds to a predefined event or sub event, such as activation of an affordance on a user
interface. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is detected, event recognizer 180
activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the event or sub-event. Event
handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176 or object updater 177 to update the
application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a respective
GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it would be clear
to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be implemented based on
the components depicted in FIGS. 1A-1B.

implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event handler 190. Event
monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive display 112, and event
dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to application 136-1. A respective
event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event information to respective event
definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a first location on the touch
sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event or sub event, such as activation of an
affordance on a user interface. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is detected,
event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the event
or sub-event. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176 or object updater 177 to
update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a
respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it
would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be
implemented based on the components depicted in FIGS. lA-lB.

4242), to the external device, at least a portion of the obtained information.
[00695]     The operations described above with reference to FIG. 53 are, optionally,
implemented by components depicted in FIGS. 1A-1B or FIG. 42. For example, input
detecting operation 5202, external device detecting operation 5204, and sending operation
5206 may be implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event handler 190.
Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive display 112, and
event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to application 136-1. A
respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event information to
