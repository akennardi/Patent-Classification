[0001]    This Application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application
No. 61/569,120 filed December 9, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety.
                                         TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]    The present technology relates generally to compositions and methods of preventing
or treating disease. In particular, the methods relate to the administration of aromatic
cationic peptides to a subject in need thereof.
                                            BACKGROUND
[0003]    The aromatic-cationic peptides disclosed herein are useful in therapeutic
applications relating to oxidative damage and cell death. When administered to a mammal in
need thereof, the peptides localize to the mitochondria and improve the integrity and function
of the organelle. Administration of the peptides to a subject in need thereof reduces the
number of mitochondria undergoing mitochondrial permeability transition, reduces the level
of oxidative damage to cells and tissues, and increases the rate of mitochondrial ATP
synthesis.
                                              SUMMARY
[0004]    In one aspect, the present invention provides an aromatic-cationic peptide or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In some embodiments, the salt comprises
trifluoroacetate salt or acetate salt. In some embodiments, the peptide is selected from the

[0025]     The definitions of certain terms as used in this specification are provided below.
Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein generally have the
same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this
invention belongs.
[0026]     As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an"l
and "the" include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. For example,
reference to "a cell" includes a combination of two or more cells, and the like.
[0027]     As used herein, the "administration" of an agent, drug, or peptide to a subject
includes any route of introducing or delivering to a subject a compound to perform its
intended function. Administration can be carried out by any suitable route, including orally,
intranasally, parenterally (intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or
subcutaneously), or topically. Administration includes self-administration and the
administration by another.
[0028]     As used herein, the term "amino acid" includes naturally-occurring amino acids and
synthetic amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function
in a manner similar to the naturally-occurring amino acids. Naturally-occurring amino acids
are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified,
e.g., hydroxyproline, y-carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refers
to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally-occurring amino
acid, i.e., an a-carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an
R group, e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium.
Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but
retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally-occurring amino acid. Amino acid
mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general
chemical structure of an amino acid, but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally
occurring amino acid. Amino acids can be referred to herein by either their commonly
                                                 16

    WO 2013/086020                                                           PCT/US2012/067984
known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB
Biochemical Nomenclature Commission.
[0029]    As used herein, the term "biological sample" refers to material derived from or
contacted by living cells. The term encompasses tissues, cells and biological fluids isolated
from a subject, as well as tissues, cells and fluids present within a subject. Biological
samples include but are not limited to, whole blood, fractionated blood, semen, saliva, tears,
urine, fecal material, sweat, buccal, skin, cerebrospinal fluid, and hair. Biological samples
also includes biopsies of internal organs and cancers. Biological samples can be obtained
from subjects for diagnosis or research or can be obtained from undiseased individuals, as
controls or for basic research.
[0030]    As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers to a quantity sufficient to achieve
a desired therapeutic and/or prophylactic effect. In the context of therapeutic or prophylactic
applications, the amount of a composition administered to the subject will depend on the type
and severity of the disease and on the characteristics of the individual, such as general health,
age, sex, body weight and tolerance to drugs. It will also depend on the degree, severity and
type of disease. The skilled artisan will be able to determine appropriate dosages depending
on these and other factors. The compositions can also be administered in combination with
one or more additional therapeutic compounds.
[0031]    An "isolated" or "purified" polypeptide or peptide is substantially free of cellular
material or other contaminating polypeptides from the cell or tissue source from which the
agent is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when
chemically synthesized. For example, an isolated aromatic-cationic peptide would be free of
materials that would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses of the agent. Such
interfering materials may include enzymes, hormones and other proteinaceous and
nonproteinaceous solutes.
[0032]    As used herein, the terms "polypeptide", "peptide", and "protein" are used
interchangeably herein to mean a polymer comprising two or more amino acids joined to
each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds, i.e., peptide isosteres. Polypeptide
refers to both short chains, commonly referred to as peptides, glycopeptides or oligomers, and
to longer chains, generally referred to as proteins. Polypeptides may contain amino acids
other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. Polypeptides include amino acid sequences

    WO 2013/086020                                                          PCT/US2012/067984
modified either by natural processes, such as post-translational processing, or by chemical
modification techniques that are well known in the art.
[0033]    As used herein, the terms "treating" or "treatment" or "alleviation" refers to both
therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to
prevent or slow down (lessen) the targeted pathologic condition or disorder. It is also to be
appreciated that the various modes of treatment or prevention of medical conditions as
described are intended to mean "substantial", which includes total but also less than total
treatment or prevention, and wherein some biologically or medically relevant result is
achieved.
[0034]    As used herein, "prevention" or "preventing" of a disorder or condition refers to a
compound that, in a statistical sample, reduces the occurrence of the disorder or condition in
the treated sample relative to an untreated control sample, or delays the onset or reduces the
severity of one or more symptoms of the disorder or condition relative to the untreated
control sample.
Methods of Prevention or Treatment
[0035]    The present technology relates to the treatment or prevention of disease by
administration of certain aromatic-cationic peptides.
[0036]    The aromatic-cationic peptides are water-soluble and highly polar. Despite these
properties, the peptides can readily penetrate cell membranes. The aromatic-cationic peptides
typically include a minimum of two or three amino acids or a minimum of four amino acids,
covalently joined by peptide bonds. The maximum number of amino acids present in the
aromatic-cationic peptides is about twenty amino acids covalently joined by peptide bonds.
Suitably, the maximum number of amino acids is about twelve, more preferably about nine,
and most preferably about six.
[0037]    The amino acids of the aromatic-cationic peptides can be any amino acid. As used
herein, the term "amino acid" is used to refer to any organic molecule that contains at least
one amino group and at least one carboxyl group. Typically, at least one amino group is at
the a position relative to a carboxyl group. The amino acids may be naturally occurring.
Naturally occurring amino acids include, for example, the twenty most common levorotatory
(L) amino acids normally found in mammalian proteins, i.e., alanine (Ala), arginine (Arg),
                                                18

    WO 2013/086020                                                            PCT/US2012/067984
asparagine (Asn), aspartic acid (Asp), cysteine (Cys), glutamine (Gln), glutamic acid (Glu),
glycine (Gly), histidine (His), isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), lysine (Lys), methionine (Met),
phenylalanine (Phe), proline (Pro), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), tryptophan, (Trp), tyrosine
(Tyr), and valine (Val). Other naturally occurring amino acids include, for example, amino
acids that are synthesized in metabolic processes not associated with protein synthesis. For
example, the amino acids ornithine and citrulline are synthesized in mammalian metabolism
during the production of urea. Another example of a naturally occurring amino acid includes
hydroxyproline (Hyp).
[0038]     The peptides optionally contain one or more non-naturally occurring amino acids.
Optimally, the peptide has no amino acids that are naturally occurring. The non-naturally
occurring amino acids may be levorotary (L-), dextrorotatory (D-), or mixtures thereof. Non
naturally occurring amino acids are those amino acids that typically are not synthesized in
normal metabolic processes in living organisms, and do not naturally occur in proteins. In
addition, the non-naturally occurring amino acids suitably are also not recognized by
common proteases. The non-naturally occurring amino acid can be present at any position in
the peptide. For example, the non-naturally occurring amino acid can be at the N-terminus,
the C-terminus, or at any position between the N-terminus and the C-terminus.
[0039]     The non-natural amino acids may, for example, comprise alkyl, aryl, or alkylaryl
groups not found in natural amino acids. Some examples of non-natural alkyl amino acids
include a-aminobutyric acid, 0-aminobutyric acid, y-aminobutyric acid, 6-aminovaleric acid,
and s-aminocaproic acid. Some examples of non-natural aryl amino acids include ortho-,
meta, and para-aminobenzoic acid. Some examples of non-natural alkylaryl amino acids
include ortho-, meta-, and para-aminophenylacetic acid, and y-phenyl-3-aminobutyric acid.
Non-naturally occurring amino acids include derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids.
The derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids may, for example, include the addition of
one or more chemical groups to the naturally occurring amino acid.
[0040]     For example, one or more chemical groups can be added to one or more of the 2', 3',
4', 5', or 6' position of the aromatic ring of a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue, or the 4', 5',
6', or 7' position of the benzo ring of a tryptophan residue. The group can be any chemical
group that can be added to an aromatic ring. Some examples of such groups include
branched or unbranched C 1-C4 alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, butyl,
isobutyl, or t-butyl, C 1-C 4 alkyloxy (i.e., alkoxy), amino, C1 -C4 alkylamino and C1 -C 4
                                                   19

    WO 2013/086020                                                           PCT/US2012/067984
dialkylamino (e.g., methylamino, dimethylamino), nitro, hydroxyl, halo (i.e., fluoro, chloro,
bromo, or iodo). Some specific examples of non-naturally occurring derivatives of naturally
occurring amino acids include norvaline (Nva) and norleucine (Nle).
[0041]    Another example of a modification of an amino acid in a peptide is the
derivatization of a carboxyl group of an aspartic acid or a glutamic acid residue of the
peptide. One example of derivatization is amidation with ammonia or with a primary or
secondary amine, e.g. methylamine, ethylamine, dimethylamine or diethylamine. Another
example of derivatization includes esterification with, for example, methyl or ethyl alcohol.
Another such modification includes derivatization of an amino group of a lysine, arginine, or
histidine residue. For example, such amino groups can be acylated. Some suitable acyl
groups include, for example, a benzoyl group or an alkanoyl group comprising any of the C1
C4 alkyl groups mentioned above, such as an acetyl or propionyl group.
[0042]    The non-naturally occurring amino acids are preferably resistant, and more
preferably insensitive, to common proteases. Examples of non-naturally occurring amino
acids that are resistant or insensitive to proteases include the dextrorotatory (D-) form of any
of the above-mentioned naturally occurring L-amino acids, as well as L- and/or D- non
naturally occurring amino acids. The D-amino acids do not normally occur in proteins,
although they are found in certain peptide antibiotics that are synthesized by means other than
the normal ribosomal protein synthetic machinery of the cell. As used herein, the D-amino
acids are considered to be non-naturally occurring amino acids.
[0043]    In order to minimize protease sensitivity, the peptides should have less than five,
preferably less than four, more preferably less than three, and most preferably, less than two
contiguous L-amino acids recognized by common proteases, irrespective of whether the
amino acids are naturally or non-naturally occurring. Optimally, the peptide has only D
amino acids, and no L-amino acids. If the peptide contains protease sensitive sequences of
amino acids, at least one of the amino acids is preferably a non-naturally-occurring D-amino
acid, thereby conferring protease resistance. An example of a protease sensitive sequence
includes two or more contiguous basic amino acids that are readily cleaved by common
proteases, such as endopeptidases and trypsin. Examples of basic amino acids include
arginine, lysine and histidine.

    WO 2013/086020                                                         PCT/US2012/067984
[0044]    The aromatic-cationic peptides should have a minimum number of net positive
charges at physiological pH in comparison to the total number of amino acid residues in the
peptide. The minimum number of net positive charges at physiological pH will be referred to
below as (pm). The total number of amino acid residues in the peptide will be referred to
below as (r). The minimum number of net positive charges discussed below are all at
physiological pH. The term "physiological pH" as used herein refers to the normal pH in the
cells of the tissues and organs of the mammalian body. For instance, the physiological pH of
a human is normally approximately 7.4, but normal physiological pH in mammals may be
any pH from about 7.0 to about 7.8.
[0045]    "Net charge" as used herein refers to the balance of the number of positive charges
and the number of negative charges carried by the amino acids present in the peptide. In this
specification, it is understood that net charges are measured at physiological pH. The
naturally occurring amino acids that are positively charged at physiological pH include L
lysine, L-arginine, and L-histidine. The naturally occurring amino acids that are negatively
charged at physiological pH include L-aspartic acid and L-glutamic acid.
[0046]    Typically, a peptide has a positively charged N-terminal amino group and a
negatively charged C-terminal carboxyl group. The charges cancel each other out at
physiological pH. As an example of calculating net charge, the peptide Tyr-Arg-Phe-Lys
Glu-His-Trp-D-Arg has one negatively charged amino acid (i.e., Glu) and four positively
charged amino acids (i.e., two Arg residues, one Lys, and one His). Therefore, the above
peptide has a net positive charge of three.

[0053]            In one embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a relationship
between the minimum number of net positive charges at physiological pH (pm) and the total
number of amino acid residues (r) wherein 3 pm is the largest number that is less than or equal
to r + 1. In this embodiment, the relationship between the minimum number of net positive
charges (pm) and the total number of amino acid residues (r) is as follows:

[0054]     In another embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a relationship between
the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and the total number of amino acid
residues (r) wherein 2 pm is the largest number that is less than or equal to r + 1. In this
embodiment, the relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and
the total number of amino acid residues (r) is as follows:
              TABLE 2. Amino acid number and net positive charges (2 pm p+1)

[0055]     In one embodiment, the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and the total
number of amino acid residues (r) are equal. In another embodiment, the peptides have three
or four amino acid residues and a minimum of one net positive charge, suitably, a minimum
of two net positive charges and more preferably a minimum of three net positive charges.
[0056]     It is also important that the aromatic-cationic peptides have a minimum number of
aromatic groups in comparison to the total number of net positive charges (p1 ). The minimum

number of aromatic groups will be referred to below as (a). Naturally occurring amino acids
that have an aromatic group include the amino acids histidine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and
phenylalanine. For example, the hexapeptide Lys-Gln-Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Trp has a net positive
charge of two (contributed by the lysine and arginine residues) and three aromatic groups
(contributed by tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan residues).
[0057]    The aromatic-cationic peptides should also have a relationship between the
minimum number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of net positive charges at
physiological pH (pt) wherein 3a is the largest number that is less than or equal to pt + 1,
except that when pt is 1, a may also be 1. In this embodiment, the relationship between the
minimum number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of net positive charges (pt) is
as follows:

[0058]    In another embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a relationship between
the minimum number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of net positive charges (pt)
wherein 2a is the largest number that is less than or equal to pt + 1. In this embodiment, the
relationship between the minimum number of aromatic amino acid residues (a) and the total
number of net positive charges (pt) is as follows:
        TABLE 4. Aromatic groups and net positive charges (2a < pt+1 or a= pt=l)

[0059]    In another embodiment, the number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of
net positive charges (pt) are equal. In one embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptide may
have
        (a) at least one net positive charge;
        (b) a minimum of three amino acids;
        (c) a maximum of about twenty amino acids;
        (d) a relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and the
total number of amino acid residues (r) wherein 3 pm is the largest number that is less than or
                                                 26

equal to r + 1; and
        (e) a relationship between the minimum number of aromatic groups (a) and the total
number of net positive charges (p1) wherein 3a is the largest number that is less than or equal
to pt+ 1, except that when a is 1, p may also be 1.
[0060]    Carboxyl groups, especially the terminal carboxyl group of a C-terminal amino acid,
are suitably amidated with, for example, ammonia to form the C-terminal amide.
Alternatively, the terminal carboxyl group of the C-terminal amino acid may be amidated
with any primary or secondary amine. The primary or secondary amine may, for example, be
an alkyl, especially a branched or unbranched C1-C4 alkyl, or an aryl amine. Accordingly,
the amino acid at the C-terminus of the peptide may be converted to an amido, N
methylamido, N-ethylamido, N,N-dimethylamido, N,N-diethylamido, N-methyl-N
ethylamido, N-phenylamido or N-phenyl-N-ethylamido group. The free carboxylate groups
of the asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid residues not occurring at the C
terminus of the aromatic-cationic peptides may also be amidated wherever they occur within
the peptide. The amidation at these internal positions may be with ammonia or any of the
primary or secondary amines described above.

[0062]    In one embodiment, the peptides have mu-opioid receptor agonist activity (i.e., they
activate the mu-opioid receptor). Mu-opioid activity can be assessed by radioligand binding
to cloned mu-opioid receptors or by bioassays using the guinea pig ileum (Schiller et al., Eur
JMed Chem, 35:895-901, 2000; Zhao et al., JPharmacolExp Ther, 307:947-954, 2003).
Activation of the mu-opioid receptor typically elicits an analgesic effect. In certain instances,
an aromatic-cationic peptide having mu-opioid receptor agonist activity is preferred. For
example, during short-term treatment, such as in an acute disease or condition, it may be
beneficial to use an aromatic-cationic peptide that activates the mu-opioid receptor. Such
acute diseases and conditions are often associated with moderate or severe pain. In these
instances, the analgesic effect of the aromatic-cationic peptide may be beneficial in the
treatment regimen of the human patient or other mammal. An aromatic-cationic peptide
which does not activate the mu-opioid receptor, however, may also be used with or without
                                                  30

    WO 2013/086020                                                           PCT/US2012/067984
an analgesic, according to clinical requirements. Peptides which have mu-opioid receptor
agonist activity are typically those peptides which have a tyrosine residue or a tyrosine
derivative at the N-terminus (i.e., the first amino acid position).
[0063]     Alternatively, in other instances, an aromatic-cationic peptide that does not have
mu-opioid receptor agonist activity is preferred. For example, during long-term treatment,
such as in a chronic disease state or condition, the use of an aromatic-cationic peptide that
activates the mu-opioid receptor may be contraindicated. In these instances, the potentially
adverse or addictive effects of the aromatic-cationic peptide may preclude the use of an
aromatic-cationic peptide that activates the mu-opioid receptor in the treatment regimen of a
human patient or other mammal. Potential adverse effects may include sedation, constipation
and respiratory depression. In such instances an aromatic-cationic peptide that does not
activate the mu-opioid receptor may be an appropriate treatment. Peptides that do not have
mu-opioid receptor agonist activity generally do not have a tyrosine residue or a derivative of
tyrosine at the N-terminus (i.e., amino acid position 1). The amino acid at the N-terminus can
be any naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring amino acid other than tyrosine. In one
embodiment, the amino acid at the N-terminus is phenylalanine or its derivative. Exemplary
derivatives of phenylalanine include 2'-methylphenylalanine (Mmp), 2',6'
dimethylphenylalanine (2',6'-Dmp), N,2',6'-trimethylphenylalanine (Tmp), and 2'-hydroxy
6'-methylphenylalanine (Hmp).
[0064]     The peptides mentioned herein and their derivatives can further include functional
variants. A peptide is considered a functional variant if the variant has the same function as
the stated peptide. The analog may, for example, be a substitution variant of a peptide,
wherein one or more amino acids are substituted by another amino acid. Suitable substitution
variants of the peptides include conservative amino acid substitutions. Amino acids may be
grouped according to their physicochemical characteristics as follows:
         (a)     Non-polar amino acids: Ala(A) Ser(S) Thr(T) Pro(P) Gly(G) Cys (C);
         (b)     Acidic amino acids: Asn(N) Asp(D) Glu(E) Gln(Q);
         (c)     Basic amino acids: His(H) Arg(R) Lys(K);
         (d)     Hydrophobic amino acids: Met(M) Leu(L) Ile(I) Val(V); and
         (e)     Aromatic amino acids: Phe(F) Tyr(Y) Trp(W) His (H).

[0065]     Substitutions of an amino acid in a peptide by another amino acid in the same group
is referred to as a conservative substitution and may preserve the physicochemical
characteristics of the original peptide. In contrast, substitutions of an amino acid in a peptide
by another amino acid in a different group is generally more likely to alter the characteristics
of the original peptide.
[0066]    In some embodiments, the peptides disclosed herein are derived from precursors,
such as peptide precursors. For example, in some embodiments, the precursor comprises an
aromatic-cationic which is also a therapeutic agent or drug.

Detection and Characterization of Aromatic-Cationic Peptides
[0068]    The aromatic-cationic peptides described herein may be detected and/or
characterized using methods known in the art. Peptides in a sample may be detected, for
example, using methods of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) such as those
described in Aguilar, HPLC of Peptides and Proteins:Methods and Protocols,Humana
                                                32

    WO 2013/086020                                                             PCT/US2012/067984
Press, New Jersey (2004). Peptides may be detected, for example, using reverse-phase HPLC
(RP-HPLC) or ion exchange HPLC. High-performance liquid chromatography (or high
pressure liquid chromatography, HPLC) is a chromatographic technique that can separate a
mixture of compounds and is used in biochemistry and analytical chemistry to identify,
quantify and purify the individual components of the mixture. HPLC typically utilizes
different types of stationary phases, a pump that moves the mobile phase(s) and analyte
through the column, and a detector to provide a characteristic retention time for the analyte.
The detector may also provide additional information related to the analyte, (e.g., UV/Vis
spectroscopic data for analyte if so equipped). Analyte retention time varies depending on the
strength of its interactions with the stationary phase, the ratio/composition of solvent(s) used,
and the flow rate of the mobile phase. Typically, with HPLC, a pump (rather than gravity)
provides the higher pressure required to move the mobile phase and analyte through a
relatively densely packed column. The increased density arises from smaller particle sizes.
This allows for a better separation on columns of shorter length when compared to ordinary
column chromatography.
[0069]    In some embodiments, peptides are detected and/or characterized using reverse
phase HPLC (RP-HPLC). Reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC or RPC) typically includes a
non-polar stationary phase and an aqueous, moderately polar mobile phase. One common
stationary phase is a silica which has been treated with RMe2SiCl, where R is a straight chain
alkyl group such as CisH 37 or CsH   17 . With these stationary phases, retention time is longer for
molecules which are less polar, while polar molecules elute more readily.
[0070]    In some emobdiments, peptides are detected and/or characterized using ion
exchange HPLC. Typically, in ion-exchange chromatography, retention is based on the
attraction between solute ions and charged sites bound to the stationary phase. Ions of the
same charge are excluded. Typical types of ion exchangers include but are not limited to the
following. Polystyrene resins. These resins allow cross linkage which increases the stability
of the chain. In general, higher cross linkage reduces swerving, which increases the
equilibration time and ultimately improves selectivity. Cellulose and dextran ion exchangers
(gels): These possess larger pore sizes and low charge densities making them suitable for
protein separation. Controlled-pore glass or porous silica.
[0071]    In general, ion exchangers favor the binding of ions of higher charge and smaller
radius. Typically, an increase in counter ion (with respect to the functional groups in resins)

concentration reduces the retention time. Typically, an increase in pH reduces the retention
time in cation exchange while a decrease in pH reduces the retention time in anion exchange.
[0072]    In addition, peptides in a sample may be characterized, for example, using methods
of mass spectrometry (MS). A general reference related to methods of mass spectrometry is
Sparkman, Mass Spectrometry Desk Reference, Pittsburgh: Global View Pub (2000).
[0073]    One of skill in the art will understand that the aromatic-cationic peptides described
herein may be detected and/or characterized using any number of conventional biochemical
methods known in the art. The HPLC and MS methods described herein are illustrative and
are not to be construed as limiting in any way.
Prophylactic and Therapeutic Uses of Aromatic-Cationic Peptides
[0074]    The aromatic-cationic peptides described herein are useful to prevent or treat
disease. Specifically, the disclosure provides for both prophylactic and therapeutic methods
of treating a subject at risk of (or susceptible to) disease by administering the aromatic
cationic peptides described herein. Accordingly, the present methods provide for the
prevention and/or treatment of disease in a subject by administering an effective amount of an
aromatic-cationic peptide to a subject in need thereof.
[0075]    In one embodiment, the peptides described above are useful in treating any disease
or condition that is associated with mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Reducing
the number of mitochondria undergoing, and preventing, MPT is important, since MPT is
associated with several common diseases and conditions in mammals. Such diseases and
conditions include, but are not limited to, ischemia and/or reperfusion of a tissue or organ,
hypoxia, neurodegenerative diseases, etc. Mammals in need of treatment or prevention of
MPT are those mammals suffering from these diseases or conditions.
[0076]    Ischemia in a tissue or organ of a mammal is a multifaceted pathological condition
which is caused by oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) and/or glucose (e.g., substrate) deprivation.
Oxygen and/or glucose deprivation in cells of a tissue or organ leads to a reduction or total
loss of energy generating capacity and consequent loss of function of active ion transport
across the cell membranes. Oxygen and/or glucose deprivation also leads to pathological
changes in other cell membranes, including permeability transition in the mitochondrial
membranes. In addition other molecules, such as apoptotic proteins normally
                                                  34

    WO 2013/086020                                                          PCT/US2012/067984
compartmentalized within the mitochondria, may leak out into the cytoplasm and cause
apoptotic cell death. Profound ischemia can lead to necrotic cell death. Ischemia or hypoxia
in a particular tissue or organ may be caused by a loss or severe reduction in blood supply to
the tissue or organ. The loss or severe reduction in blood supply may, for example, be due to
thromboembolic stroke, coronary atherosclerosis, or peripheral vascular disease. The tissue
affected by ischemia or hypoxia is typically muscle, such as cardiac, skeletal, or smooth
muscle. The organ affected by ischemia or hypoxia may be any organ that is subject to
ischemia or hypoxia. Examples of organs affected by ischemia or hypoxia include brain,
heart, kidney, and prostate. For instance, cardiac muscle ischemia or hypoxia is commonly
caused by atherosclerotic or thrombotic blockages which lead to the reduction or loss of
oxygen delivery to the cardiac tissues by the cardiac arterial and capillary blood supply. Such
cardiac ischemia or hypoxia may cause pain and necrosis of the affected cardiac muscle, and
ultimately may lead to cardiac failure. Ischemia or hypoxia in skeletal muscle or smooth
muscle may arise from similar causes. For example, ischemia or hypoxia in intestinal smooth
muscle or skeletal muscle of the limbs may also be caused by atherosclerotic or thrombotic
blockages.
[0077]    Reperfusion is the restoration of blood flow to any organ or tissue in which the flow
of blood is decreased or blocked. For example, blood flow can be restored to any organ or
tissue affected by ischemia or hypoxia. The restoration of blood flow (reperfusion) can occur
by any method known to those in the art. For instance, reperfusion of ischemic cardiac tissues
may arise from angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft, or the use of thrombolytic drugs.
[0078]    The methods described herein can also be used in the treatment or prophylaxis of
neurodegenerative diseases associated with MPT. Neurodegenerative diseases associated
with MPT include, for instance, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's
disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gherig's disease). The
methods disclosed herein can be used to delay the onset or slow the progression of these and
other neurodegenerative diseases associated with MPT. The methods disclosed herein are
particularly useful in the treatment of humans suffering from the early stages of
neurodegenerative diseases associated with MPT and in humans predisposed to these
diseases.
[0079]    The aromatic-cationic peptides described above are also useful in preventing or
treating insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, bum injuries and secondary complications,

    WO 2013/086020                                                          PCT/US2012/067984
heart failure, diabetic complications (such as diabetic retinopathy), ophthalmic conditions
(such as choroidal neovascularization, retinal degeneration, and oxygen-induced retinopathy).
[0080]      The aromatic-cationic peptides described above are also useful in reducing oxidative
damage in a mammal in need thereof. Mammals in need of reducing oxidative damage are
those mammals suffering from a disease, condition or treatment associated with oxidative
damage. Typically, the oxidative damage is caused by free radicals, such as reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and/or reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Examples of ROS and RNS include
hydroxyl radical (HO-), superoxide anion radical (02), nitric oxide (NO-), hydrogen peroxide
(H2 0 2 ), hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and peroxynitrite anion (ONOO-). In one embodiment, a
mammal in need thereof may be a mammal undergoing a treatment associated with oxidative
damage. For example, the mammal may be undergoing reperfusion, ischemia, or hypoxia.
[0081]      In another embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides can be used to prevent lipid
peroxidation and/or inflammatory processes that are associated with oxidative damage for a
disease or condition. Lipid peroxidation refers to oxidative modification of lipids. The lipids
can be present in the membrane of a cell. This modification of membrane lipids typically
results in change and/or damage to the membrane function of a cell. In addition, lipid
peroxidation can also occur in lipids or lipoproteins exogenous of a cell. For example, low
density lipoproteins are susceptible to lipid peroxidation. An example of a condition
associated with lipid peroxidation is atherosclerosis. Reducing oxidative damage associated
with atherosclerosis is important since atherosclerosis is implicated in, for example, heart
attacks and coronary artery disease.
[0082]      Inflammatory processes include and activation of the immune system. Typically, the
immune system is activated by an antigenic substance. The antigenic substance can be any
substance recognized by the immune system, and include self-derived particles and foreign
derived particles. Examples of diseases or conditions occurring from an inflammatory process
to self-derived particles include arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Examples of foreign particles
include viruses and bacteria. The virus can be any virus which activates an inflammatory
process, and associated with oxidative damage. Examples of viruses include, hepatitis A, B or
C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus, and bovine diarrhea virus. For
example, hepatitis virus can elicit an inflammatory process and formation of free radicals,
thereby damaging the liver. The bacteria can be any bacteria, and include gram-negative or
gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria contain lipopolysaccharide in the bacteria
                                                 36

    WO 2013/086020                                                            PCT/US2012/067984
wall. Examples of gram-negative bacteria include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Proteus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia, and Bacteroides. Examples of gram
positive bacteria include pneumococci and streptococci. An example of an inflammatory
process associated with oxidative stress caused by a bacteria is sepsis. Typically, sepsis
occurs when gram-negative bacteria enter the bloodstream.
[0083]    Liver damage caused by a toxic agent is another condition associated with an
inflammatory process and oxidative stress. The toxic agent can be any agent which causes
damage to the liver. For example, the toxic agent can cause apoptosis and/or necrosis of liver
cells. Examples of such agents include alcohol, and medication, such as prescription and non
prescription drugs taken to treat a disease or condition.
[0084]    The methods disclosed herein can also be used in reducing oxidative damage
associated with any neurodegenerative disease or condition. The neurodegenerative disease
can affect any cell, tissue or organ of the central and peripheral nervous system. Examples of
such cells, tissues and organs include, the brain, spinal cord, neurons, ganglia, Schwann cells,
astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia. The neurodegenerative condition can be an acute
condition, such as a stroke or a traumatic brain or spinal cord injury. In another embodiment,
the neurodegenerative disease or condition can be a chronic neurodegenerative condition. In a
chronic neurodegenerative condition, the free radicals can, for example, cause damage to a
protein. An example of such a protein is amyloid .beta.-protein. Examples of chronic
neurodegenerative diseases associated with damage by free radicals include Parkinson's
disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (also
known as Lou Gherig's disease).
[0085]    Determinationof the BiologicalEffect of the Aromatic-CationicPeptide-Based
Therapeutic. In various embodiments, suitable in vitro or in vivo assays are performed to
determine the effect of a specific aromatic-cationic peptide-based therapeutic and whether its
administration is indicated for treatment. In various embodiments, in vitro assays can be
performed with representative animal models, to determine if a given aromatic-cationic
peptide-based therapeutic exerts the desired effect in preventing or treating a disease or
medical condition. Compounds for use in therapy can be tested in suitable animal model
systems including, but not limited to rats, mice, chicken, pigs, cows, monkeys, rabbits, and
the like, prior to testing in human subjects. Similarly, for in vivo testing, any of the animal
model systems known in the art can be used prior to administration to human subjects.

[0086]    ProphylacticMethods. In one aspect, the invention provides a method for
preventing, in a subject, disease by administering to the subject an aromatic-cationic peptide
that prevents the initiation or progression of the condition. In prophylactic applications,
pharmaceutical compositions or medicaments of aromatic-cationic peptides are administered
to a subject susceptible to, or otherwise at risk of a disease or condition in an amount
sufficient to eliminate or reduce the risk, lessen the severity, or delay the outset of the
disease, including biochemical, histologic and/or behavioral symptoms of the disease, its
complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of
the disease. Administration of a prophylactic aromatic-cationic can occur prior to the
manifestation of symptoms characteristic of the aberrancy, such that a disease or disorder is
prevented or, alternatively, delayed in its progression. The appropriate compound can be
determined based on screening assays described above.
[0087]    TherapeuticMethods. Another aspect of the technology includes methods of
treating disease in a subject for therapeutic purposes. In therapeutic applications,
compositions or medicaments are administered to a subject suspected of, or already suffering
from such a disease in an amount sufficient to cure, or at least partially arrest, the symptoms
of the disease, including its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes in
development of the disease. As such, the invention provides methods of treating an
individual afflicted with a disease or medical condition.
Modes of Administration and Effective Dosages
[0088]    Any method known to those in the art for contacting a cell, organ or tissue with a
peptide may be employed. Suitable methods include in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo methods. In
vivo methods typically include the administration of an aromatic-cationic peptide, such as
those described above, to a mammal, suitably a human. When used in vivo for therapy, the
aromatic-cationic peptides are administered to the subject in effective amounts (i.e., amounts
that have desired therapeutic effect). The dose and dosage regimen will depend upon the
degree of the injury in the subject, the characteristics of the particular aromatic-cationic
peptide used, e.g., its therapeutic index, the subject, and the subject's history.
[0089]    The effective amount may be determined during pre-clinical trials and clinical trials
by methods familiar to physicians and clinicians. An effective amount of a peptide useful in
the methods may be administered to a mammal in need thereof by any of a number of well

known methods for administering pharmaceutical compounds. The peptide may be
administered systemically or locally.
[0090]     The peptide may be formulated as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term
"pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means a salt prepared from a base or an acid which is
acceptable for administration to a patient, such as a mammal (e.g., salts having acceptable
mammalian safety for a given dosage regime). However, it is understood that the salts are not
required to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as salts of intermediate compounds that
are not intended for administration to a patient. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be
derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases and from
pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids. In addition, when a peptide contains
both a basic moiety, such as an amine, pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety such as a
carboxylic acid or tetrazole, zwitterions may be formed and are included within the term
"salt" as used herein. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic bases include
ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous,
potassium, sodium, and zinc salts, and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically
acceptable organic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including
substituted amines, cyclic amines, naturally-occurring amines and the like, such as arginine,
betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2
diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N
ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine,
isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperadine, polyamine
resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine,
tromethamine and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic acids
include salts of boric, carbonic, hydrohalic (hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydrofluoric or
hydroiodic), nitric, phosphoric, sulfamic and sulfuric acids. Salts derived from
pharmaceutically acceptable organic acids include salts of aliphatic hydroxyl acids (e.g.,
citric, gluconic, glycolic, lactic, lactobionic, malic, and tartaric acids), aliphatic
monocarboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, butyric, formic, propionic and trifluoroacetic acids),
amino acids (e.g., aspartic and glutamic acids), aromatic carboxylic acids (e.g., benzoic, p
chlorobenzoic, diphenylacetic, gentisic, hippuric, and triphenylacetic acids), aromatic
hydroxyl acids (e.g., o-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 1-hydroxynaphthalene-2
carboxylic and 3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acids), ascorbic, dicarboxylic acids (e.g.,
fumaric, maleic, oxalic and succinic acids), glucoronic, mandelic, mucic, nicotinic, orotic,

pamoic, pantothenic, sulfonic acids (e.g., benzenesulfonic, camphosulfonic, edisylic,
ethanesulfonic, isethionic, methanesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, naphthalene- 1,5-disulfonic,
naphthalene-2,6-disulfonic and p-toluenesulfonic acids), xinafoic acid, and the like. In some
embodiments, the salt comprises trifluoroacetate salt or acetate salt.
[0091]     The aromatic-cationic peptides described herein or a pharmaceutically salt thereof
such as acteate salt or trifluoroacetate salt, can be incorporated into pharmaceutical
compositions for administration, singly or in combination, to a subject for the treatment or
prevention of a disease or medical condition described herein. Such compositions typically
include the active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the term
"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes saline, solvents, dispersion media, coatings,
antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like,
compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Supplementary active compounds can also be
incorporated into the compositions.
[0092]     Pharmaceutical compositions are typically formulated to be compatible with its
intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral
(e.g., intravenous, intradermal, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous), oral, inhalation, transdermal
(topical), intraocular, iontophoretic, and transmucosal administration. Solutions or
suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the
following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils,
polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial
agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or
sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as
acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium
chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or
sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable
syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. For convenience of the patient or
treating physician, the dosing formulation can be provided in a kit containing all necessary
equipment (e.g., vials of drug, vials of diluent, syringes and needles) for a treatment course
(e.g., 7 days of treatment).
[0093]     Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use can include sterile aqueous
solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous
preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration,

    WO 2013/086020                                                            PCT/US2012/067984
suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor ELTM (BASF,
Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, a composition for
parenteral administration must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy
syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and
must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and
fungi.
[0094]    The aromatic-cationic peptide compositions or a pharmaceutically salt thereof such
as acteate salt or trifluoroacetate salt, can include a carrier, which can be a solvent or
dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol,
propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof.
The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin,
by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of
surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various
antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic
acid, thiomerasol, and the like. Glutathione and other antioxidants can be included to prevent
oxidation. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars,
polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged
absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the
composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate or
gelatin.
[0095]    Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in
the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients
enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are
prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle, which contains a basic
dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the
case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, typical methods of
preparation include vacuum drying and freeze drying, which can yield a powder of the active
ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution
thereof.
[0096]    Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the
purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with
excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules. Oral
                                                  41

     WO 2013/086020                                                          PCT/US2012/067984
compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash.
Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as
part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of
the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline
cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating
agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or
Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or
saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.
[0097]    For administration by inhalation, the compounds can be delivered in the form of an
aerosol spray from a pressurized container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant,
e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. Such methods include those described in
U.S. Pat. No. 6,468,798.
[0098]     Systemic administration of a therapeutic compound as described herein can also be
by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration,
penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such
penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal
administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal
administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays. For transdermal
administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams
as generally known in the art. In one embodiment, transdermal administration may be
performed my iontophoresis.
[0099]    A therapeutic peptide or a pharmaceutically salt thereof such as acteate salt or
trifluoroacetate salt, can be formulated in a carrier system. The carrier can be a colloidal
system. The colloidal system can be a liposome, a phospholipid bilayer vehicle. In one
embodiment, the therapeutic peptide is encapsulated in a liposome while maintaining peptide
integrity. As one skilled in the art would appreciate, there are a variety of methods to prepare
liposomes. (See Lichtenberg et al., Methods Biochem. Anal., 33:337-462 (1988); Anselem et
al., Liposome Technology, CRC Press (1993)). Liposomal formulations can delay clearance
and increase cellular uptake (See Reddy, Ann. Pharmacother.,34(7-8):915-923 (2000)). An
active agent can also be loaded into a particle prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable
ingredients including, but not limited to, soluble, insoluble, permeable, impermeable,
biodegradable or gastroretentive polymers or liposomes. Such particles include, but are not
                                                 42

limited to, nanoparticles, biodegradable nanoparticles, microparticles, biodegradable
microparticles, nanospheres, biodegradable nanospheres, microspheres, biodegradable
microspheres, capsules, emulsions, liposomes, micelles and viral vector systems.
[0100]    The carrier can also be a polymer, e.g., a biodegradable, biocompatible polymer
matrix. In one embodiment, the therapeutic peptide can be embedded in the polymer matrix,
while maintaining protein integrity. The polymer may be natural, such as polypeptides,
proteins or polysaccharides, or synthetic, such as poly a-hydroxy acids. Examples include
carriers made of, e.g., collagen, fibronectin, elastin, cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate,
polysaccharide, fibrin, gelatin, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the polymer is
poly-lactic acid (PLA) or copoly lactic/glycolic acid (PGLA). The polymeric matrices can be
prepared and isolated in a variety of forms and sizes, including microspheres and
nanospheres. Polymer formulations can lead to prolonged duration of therapeutic effect. (See
Reddy, Ann. Pharmacother.,34(7-8):915-923 (2000)). A polymer formulation for human
growth hormone (hGH) has been used in clinical trials. (See Kozarich and Rich, Chemical
Biology, 2:548-552 (1998)).
[0101]    Examples of polymer microsphere sustained release formulations are described in
PCT publication WO 99/15154 (Tracy et al.), U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,674,534 and 5,716,644 (both
to Zale et al.), PCT publication WO 96/40073 (Zale et al.), and PCT publication WO
00/38651 (Shah et al.). U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,674,534 and 5,716,644 and PCT publication WO
96/40073 describe a polymeric matrix containing particles of erythropoietin that are
stabilized against aggregation with a salt.
[0102]    In some embodiments, the therapeutic compounds are prepared with carriers that
will protect the therapeutic compounds against rapid elimination from the body, such as a
controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems.
Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate,
polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylacetic acid. Such
formulations can be prepared using known techniques. The materials can also be obtained
commercially, e.g., from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal
suspensions (including liposomes targeted to specific cells with monoclonal antibodies to
cell-specific antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be
prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in
U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811.

[0103]     The therapeutic compounds can also be formulated to enhance intracellular delivery.
For example, liposomal delivery systems are known in the art, see, e.g., Chonn and Cullis,
"Recent Advances in Liposome Drug Delivery Systems," Current Opinion in Biotechnology
6:698-708 (1995); Weiner, "Liposomes for Protein Delivery: Selecting Manufacture and
Development Processes," Immunomethods, 4(3):201-9 (1994); and Gregoriadis, "Engineering
Liposomes for Drug Delivery: Progress and Problems," Trends Biotechnol., 13(12):527-37
(1995). Mizguchi et al., CancerLett., 100:63-69 (1996), describes the use of fusogenic
liposomes to deliver a protein to cells both in vivo and in vitro.
[0104]     Dosage, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the therapeutic agents can be
determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals,
e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the
dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and
therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50.
Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that
exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that
targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to
uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.
[0105]     The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in
formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies
preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no
toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed
and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods, the
therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose can
be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that
includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half
maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used
to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for
example, by high performance liquid chromatography.
[0106]     Dosage may also be determined empirically by detecting aromatic-cationic peptides
in a biological sample from a subject. Biological samples obtained from a subject who has
been administered aromatic-cationic peptides may be subjected to HPLC and/or MS to detect
and characterize the aromatic-cationic peptides present in the subject's bodily fluids and
                                                44

    WO 2013/086020                                                           PCT/US2012/067984
tissues. Biological samples include any material derived from or contacted by living cells.
Examples of biological samples include but are not limited to whole blood, fractionated
blood, semen, saliva, tears, urine, fecal material, sweat, buccal, skin, cerebrospinal fluid, and
hair. Biological samples also include biopsies of internal organs, organs removed for
transplant or cancers. The presence of aromatic-cationic peptides in the biological sample is
established by comparison to data obtained for reference samples such as those provided in
Example 6. The levels of aromatic-cationic peptides present in the sample may serve as a
basis to increase or decrease the dosage of an aromatic-cationic peptide or a precursor
thereof, administered to a given subject, wherein the precursor may be an aromatic-cationic
which is also a therapeutic agent or drug.
[0107]    Typically, an effective amount of the aromatic-cationic peptides, sufficient for
achieving a therapeutic or prophylactic effect, range from about 0.00000 1 mg per kilogram
body weight per day to about 10,000 mg per kilogram body weight per day. Preferably, the
dosage ranges are from about 0.000 1 mg per kilogram body weight per day to about 100 mg
per kilogram body weight per day. For example dosages can be 1 mg/kg body weight or 10
mg/kg body weight every day, every two days or every three days or within the range of 1-10
mg/kg every week, every two weeks or every three weeks. In one embodiment, a single
dosage of peptide ranges from 0.1-10,000 micrograms per kg body weight. In one
embodiment, aromatic-cationic peptide concentrations in a carrier range from 0.2 to 2000
micrograms per delivered milliliter. An exemplary treatment regime entails administration
once per day or once a week. In therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at
relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or
terminated, and preferably until the subject shows partial or complete amelioration of
symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patient can be administered a prophylactic regime.
[0108]    In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of an aromatic-cationic
peptide may be defined as a concentration of peptide at the target tissue of 10-11 to 10-6 molar,
e.g., approximately 10-7 molar. This concentration may be delivered by systemic doses of
0.01 to 100 mg/kg or equivalent dose by body surface area. The schedule of doses would be
optimized to maintain the therapeutic concentration at the target tissue, most preferably by
single daily or weekly administration, but also including continuous administration (e.g.,
parenteral infusion or transdermal application).

[0109]    In some embodiments, the dosage of the aromatic-cationic peptide is provided at a
"low," "mid," or "high" dose level. In one embodiment, the low dose is provided from about
0.01 to about 0.5 mg/kg/h, suitably from about 0.01 to about 0.1 mg/kg/h. In one
embodiment, the mid-dose is provided from about 0.1 to about 1.0 mg/kg/h, suitably from
about 0.1 to about 0.5 mg/kg/h. In one embodiment, the high dose is provided from about 0.5
to about 10 mg/kg/h, suitably from about 0.5 to about 2 mg/kg/h.
[0110]    The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage and
timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to, the severity of the
disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and
other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective
amount of the therapeutic compositions described herein can include a single treatment or a
series of treatments.
[0111]    In some embodiments, multiple doses, or varying amounts of an aromatic-cationic
peptide are administered to a subject. In some embodiments, the multiple doses or varying
amounts of the peptide are administered throughout the course of a procedure (e.g., a surgery)
or are administered throughout the course of a disease or conditions. For example, in some
embodiments, the peptide is administered intraveneously, for example during a surgery, and
the amount of peptide provided to the subject is adjusted during the procedure. In other
embodiments, the subject is administered a dose of peptide (e.g., orally or by injection, e.g.,
intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraosseous, and intraperitoneal)
about once every 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8
hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, once per day, once every other day, or once per week. In some
embodiments, the amount of peptide present in the subject (the subject's peptide level) is
monitored to determine the appropriate dose and schedule needed to maintain a desired
peptide level in the subject. In some embodiments, peptide levels are determined periodically
during administration, and/or are determined at one or more time points after administration.
For example, in some embodiments, peptide levels are determined within a few minutes of
administration, about 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8
hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, two days, 3 days 5 days, 7 days or 14 days after
administration. In other embodiments, the subjects peptide levels are determined every 10
minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, hourly, every two hours, every 4 hours, every 6
hours or every 12 hours, for a predetermined time, such as during a surgical procedure.

Depending on the determined peptide level, one or more additional doses may be provided to
achieve a desired peptide level to maintain a therapeutic effect. In some embodiments,
peptide levels may be found sufficient to delay an additional dose or doses.
[0112]     In some embodiments, the detected levels of aromatic-cationic peptide are compared
to aromatic-cationic peptide levels in a healthy control subject (e.g., a subject who has been
administered substantially the same dose of the peptide via substantially the same route of
administration). Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the level of the peptide
is determined in different organs, systems and/or fluids of a subject. In some embodiments,
the level of the peptide is determined in different organs, systems and/or fluids of a subject
and compared to peptide levels in comparable systems, organs, and fluids of a control
subject. In some embodiments, such an analysis provides information regarding the
availability of the peptide, and the transport of the peptide throughout the body of the subject
as compared to the control. For example, the route of administration may be changed for a
particular subject to optimize peptide delivery to a particular tissue or organ (e.g., to achieve
a more localized distribution of the peptide). Additionally or alternatively, the route of

distribution.
[0113]     Method for identifying and determining the presence or amount (level) of an
aromatic-cationic peptide in a subject sample are known in the art and include, but are not
limited to HPLC and mass spectrometry.
[0114]     As noted previously, in some embodiments, peptide levels are determined in a
biological sample from the subject, and include, without limitation, blood samples, tissues
samples, (e.g., organ or tumor biopsy samples), urine and saliva.
[0115]     Also disclosed herein are kits for the detection of aromatic-cationic peptides. In
some embodiments, the kits include a sample collection device to collect a sample from the
subject, and a sample storage device for preservation of the biological sample. Depending on
the intended method of detection, the sample is stored in an appropriate buffer or
preservative, also provided in the kit. In some embodiments, a sample collector includes a
container for liquid, such as a vial or tube (e.g., for blood, blood products, urine). In other
embodiments, the sample collector is an absorbent material, such as a sterile cotton swab
(e.g., to collect a buccal sample, saliva, nasal swabs, etc), a slide, a sterile paper, a card, a

including, for example, farm animals, such as sheep, pigs, cows, and horses; pet animals,
such as dogs and cats; laboratory animals, such as rats, mice and rabbits. In a suitable
embodiment, the mammal is a human.
                                            EXAMPLES
[0118]     The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which should
not be construed as limiting in any way.
Example 1 - Aromatic-Cationic Peptides of the Present Technology Inhibit Inhibits H2 0 2
Generation by Isolated Mitochondria
[0119]     In this Example, the effects of the aromatic-cationic peptides of the invention on
H 2 0 2 generation by isolated mitochondria are investigated. H 2 0 2 is measured using luminol
chemiluminescence as described in Y. Li, H. Zhu, M. A. Trush, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1428,
1-12 (1999)). Briefly, 0.1 mg mitochondrial protein is added to 0.5 ml potassium phosphate
buffer (100 mM, pH 8.0) in the absence or presence of an aromatic-cationic peptide. Luminol
(25 mM) and 0.7 IU horseradish peroxidase are added, and chemilumunescence is monitored
with a Chronolog Model 560 aggregometer (Havertown, Pa.) for 20 min at 37 0 C. The
amount of H 2 0 2 produced is quantified as the area under the curve (AUC) over 20 min, and
all data are normaliized to AUC produced by mitochondria alone.
[0120]     It is predicted that the aromatic-cationic peptide will reduce the spontaneous
production of H 2 0 2 by isolated mitochondria. As such, the aromatic-cationic peptides are
useful for reducing oxidative damage and are useful in the treatment or prevention of diseases
or conditions that relate to oxidative damage.

    WO 2013/086020                                                           PCT/US2012/067984
Example 2 - Aromatic-Cationic Peptides of the Present Technology Reduce Intracellular
ROS and Increase Cell Survival
[0121]     To show that the claimed peptides are effective antioxidants when applied to whole
cells, neuronal N 2A cells are plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1x10 4 /well and allowed
to grow for 2 days before treatment with tBHP (0.5 or 1 mM) for 40 min. Cells are washed
twice and replaced with medium alone or medium containing varying concentrations of
aromatic-cationic peptides (10-12 M to 10-9 M) for 4 h. Intracellular ROS is measured by
carboxy-H 2DCFDA (Molecular Probes, Portland, Oreg.). Cell death is assessed by a cell
proliferation assay (MTS assay, Promega, Madison, Wis.).
[0122]     Incubation with tBHP will result in an increase in intracellular ROS and decrease in
cell viability. However, it is predicted that incubation of these cells with an aromatic-cationic
peptide will reduce intracellular ROS and increase cell survival. As such, the aromatic
cationic peptides are useful for reducing oxidative damage and are useful in the treatment or
prevention of diseases or conditions that relate to oxidative damage.
Example 3 - Aromatic-cationic Peptides of the Present Technology Protect Against MPT
Induced by Ca 2 + and 3-Nitropropionic Acid
[0123]     To isolate mitochondria from mouse liver, mice are sacrificed by decapitation. The
liver is removed and rapidly placed into chilled liver homogenization medium. The liver is
finely minced using scissors and then homogenized by hand using a glass homogenizer. The
homogenate is centrifuged for 10 min at 10OOg at 4'C. The supernatant is aspirated and
transferred to polycarbonate tubes and centrifuged again for 10 min at 3000g, 4'C. The
resulting supernatant is removed, and the fatty lipids on the side-wall of the tube are carefully
wiped off. The pellet is resuspended in liver homogenate medium and the homogenization
repeated twice. The final purified mitochondrial pellet is resuspended in medium. Protein
concentration in the mitochondrial preparation is determined by the Bradford procedure.
[0124]     To investigate the localization of the aromatic-cationic peptides of the invention,
approximately 1.5 mg mitochondria in 400 gl buffer is incubated with labeled aromatic
cationic peptide for 5-30 min at 37'C. The mitochondria are then centrifuged down and the
amount of label is measured in the mitochondrial fraction and buffer fraction. Assuming a
mitochondrial matrix volume of 0.7 gl/mg protein (Lim et al., JPhysiol 545:961-974, 2002),
the concentration of peptide in mitochondria can be determined. It is predicted that the
                                                 49

    WO 2013/086020                                                          PCT/US2012/067984
claimed aromatic-cationic peptides will be more concentrated in mitochondria compared to
the buffer fraction.
[0125]    To investigate the effects of the aromatic-cationic peptides of the invention on
mitochondrial membrane potential, isolated mouse liver mitochondria are incubated with
100-200 gM aromatic-cationic peptide. Mitochondrial membrane potential is measured using
tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM). Addition of mitochondria results in immediate
quenching of the TMRM signal which is readily reversed by the addition of FCCP, indicating
mitochondrial depolarization. The addition of Ca2+ (150 gM) results in immediate
depolarization followed by progressive loss of quenching, indicative of MPT. Addition of
aromatic-cationic peptide alone, even at 200 gM, is not predicted to cause mitochondrial
depolarization or MPT. It is also predicted that the aromatic-cationic peptides will not alter
mitochondrial function, including oxygen consumption during state 3 or state 4, or the
respiratory ratio (state 3/state 4).
[0126]    To show that the claimed peptides are effective at protecting against MPT induced
by Ca2+ overload, isolated mitochondria are pre-treated with aromatic-cationic peptide (10
gM) for 2 min prior to addition of Ca2+. It is predicted that the aromatic-cationic peptides of
the invention will increase the tolerance of mitochondria to cumulative Ca2+ challenges.
[0127]    3-Nitropropionic acid (3NP) is an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase
in complex II of the electron transport chain. Addition of 3NP (1 mM) to isolated
mitochondria causes dissipation of mitochondrial potential and onset of MPT. Pretreatment
of mitochondria with the aromatic-cationic peptides of the invention is predicted to delay the
onset of MPT induced by 3NP.
[0128]    To demonstrate that the aromatic-cationic peptides of the invention can penetrate
cell membranes and protect against mitochondrial depolarization elicited by 3NP, Caco-2
cells are treated with 3NP (10 mM) in the absence or presence of the aromatic-cationic
peptides for 4 h, and then incubated with TMRM and examined under LSCM. In control
cells, the mitochondria are clearly visualized as fine streaks throughout the cytoplasm. In
cells treated with 3NP, the TMRM fluorescence is much reduced, indicating generalized
depolarization. In contrast, it is predicted that concurrent treatment with the aromatic
cationic peptides of the invention will protect against mitochondrial depolarization caused by
3NP.

    WO 2013/086020                                                          PCT/US2012/067984
[0129]    As such, the aromatic-cationic peptides are useful for preventing MPT and are
useful in the treatment or prevention of diseases or conditions that relate to MPT.
Example 4 - Aromatic-cationic Peptides of the Present Technology Protect Against
Mitochondrial Swelling and Cytochrome c Release
[0130]    MPT pore opening results in mitochondrial swelling. This Example examines the
effects of the aromatic-cationic peptides of the invention on mitochondrial swelling by
measuring reduction in absorbance at 540 nm (A5 4 0). Once the absorbance is measured, the
mitochondrial suspension is then centrifuged and cytochrome c in the mitochondrial pellet
and supernatant is determined by a commercially-available ELISA kit. It is predicted that
pretreatment of isolated mitochondria with the aromatic-cationic peptides of the invention
will inhibit swelling and cytochrome c release induced by Ca 2 + overload. Besides preventing
MPT induced by Ca 2 + overload, it is predicted that the aromatic-cationic peptides of the
invention will also prevent mitochondrial swelling induced by MPP+(1-methyl-4
phenylpyridium ion), an inhibitor of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.
[0131]    As such, the aromatic-cationic peptides are useful for preventing MPT and are
useful in the treatment or prevention of diseases or conditions that relate to MPT.
Example 5 - The Peptides of the Present Technology increase the rate ATP synthesis in
isolated mitochondria.
[0132]    This example will demonstrate the impact of peptides of the present technology on
the rate of mitochondrial ATP synthesis.
[0133]    The rate of mitochondrial ATP synthesis will be determined by measuring ATP in
respiration buffer collected from isolated mitochondria 1 min after addition of 400 mM ADP.
ATP will be assayed by HPLC. All experiments will be carried out in triplicate, with n=3. It
is predicted that addition of peptides of the present technology to isolated mitochondria will
increase the rate of ATP synthesis in a dose-dependent manner.
[0134]    This result will demonstrate the peptides of the present technology are useful in
methods and compositions for increasing the rate of mitochondrial ATP synthesis.

Example 6 - Characterization of Aromatic-Cationic Peptides
[0135]    Aromatic-cationic peptides of the present technology can be synthesized using solid
phase synthesis and characterized using HPLC and MS. Exemplary HPLC and MS methods
are provided in Examples 7 and 8 below.
Example 7 - Detection of Aromatic-Cationic Peptides in a Biological Sample
[0136]    This example demonstrates the detection of aromatic-cationic peptides in a
biological sample by HPLC. Biological samples are collected from subjects in a suitable
manner depending on the nature of the sample. Biological samples include any material
derived from or contacted by living cells. Examples of biological samples include but are not
limited to whole blood, fractionated blood, semen, saliva, tears, urine, fecal material, sweat,
buccal, skin, cerebrospinal fluid, and hair. Biological samples also include biopsies of
internal organs or cancers. Once obtained, the biological samples are stored in a manner
compatible with the methods of detection until the methods are performed to ensure the
preservation of aromatic -cationic peptides present in the sample.
[0137]    Samples are loaded onto a 250 x 4.6 (i.d.) mm C18 5 gm column and subjected to a
gradient of 0.10%trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (Solution A) and 0.10%trifluoroacetic acid

by comparison to data obtained for reference samples such as those provided in Example 6.

any way. One of skill in the art will understand that the aromatic-cationic peptides described

biological sample by MS. Biological samples are collected from subjects in a suitable manner

whole blood, fractionated blood, semen, saliva, tears, urine, fecal material, sweat, buccal,
skin, cerebrospinal fluid, and hair. Biological samples also include biopsies of internal
