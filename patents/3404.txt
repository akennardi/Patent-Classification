 5 Related Application
              This application is a divisional application of Australian Application No. 2014295310,
   the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Most of the disclosure of that
   application is included herein.    However, reference may be made to the specification of that
   application as filed to gain further understanding of the invention claimed herein.

   Technical Field
            The present invention relates to a wind power generation tower, and more particularly to a
   wind power generation tower having a vertical shaft wind power turbine in an interior thereof.
   Background Art
15          In general, a wind power generation system refers to a technology for converting a force of
   wind into a rotating force to produce electric power, and is a system for converting wind energy into
   mechanical energy, driving a generator, and producing electric power.
            Such wind power generation systems are classified into horizontal shaft wind power
   generation systems and vertical shaft wind power generation systems. The horizontal shaft wind
20 power generation systems show a high efficiency but are significantly influenced by the direction of
   wind, and the vertical shaft wind power generation systems are not significantly influenced by the
   direction of wind but the efficiency thereof is not as high as that of the horizontal shaft wind power
   generation systems. Accordingly, most main businesses related to wind power generation are
   intensively interested in horizontal shaft wind power generation, and considerably many studies on a
25 method of increasing efficiency of the vertical shaft wind power generation are being conducted.
   However, a proper measure for increasing the efficiency of a vertical shaft wind power generation
   system has not been found yet Meanwhile, the present invention relates to a vertical shaft wind
   power generation system, and thus a vertical wind power generation system will be described
   hereinbelow.
30          The vertical shaft wind power generation system has a technical advantage of utilizing wind
   blowing from all directions, but it is generally difficult to efficiently generate power because the
   direction and strength of wind are not constant by using the wind blowing in the atmosphere.
   Accordingly, various methods for effectively concentrating the direction of wind have been
   developed in an attempt to solve the problem, and for example, a measure of additionally adding a
                                                        1
                                                                                 9986936 1 (GHMatters) P102035.AJ.1 15/02/2018

   wind collection pipe structure having guide walls around a vertical shaft wind power turbine such
   that wind can flow in a constant direction and the speed of wind can be increased.
             Korean Patent Application Publication No. 2009-0035884 (Acceleration type wind power
   generator) discloses a technology in which a wind power generator has a drag type wind power
 5 turbine in an interior thereof and a wind collection pipe structure for making the direction of wind
   constant and increasing the speed of wind at the same time is installed around the wind power
   turbine such that the efficiency of the vertical shaft wind power turbine can be increased.
             Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2010-531594 (Wind power turbine having
   vertical shaft) discloses a technology in which a drag type vertical shaft wind power turbine is
10 provided in the interior of a wind power tower and a wind collection pipe structure for making the
   direction of wind constant and increasing the speed of wind at the same time is installed around the
   drag type vertical shaft wind power turbine.
             However, each of the wind collection pipes disclosed in the patents is designed such that
   wind guided to the wind collection pipe directly contacts drag type wind power blades to induce
15 rotation of the wind power blades, in which case it is difficult to consistently generate wind power as
   the movement of the drag type blades change in the same way according to the change of wind.
   Furthermore, because the wind having passed through the guide walls directly contacts the drag type
   blades so that resistance is considerably generated, the configuration is advantageous when the drag
   type blades are initially started but makes it difficult to effectively generate wind power as it acts as a
20 resistance when the speed of wind is high.
             Accordingly, the applicant of the present invention sought a wind power generation tower
   including a vertical shaft wind power turbine to solve the above-described technical problems.
   Summary of the Invention
25           A wind power generation tower according to an embodiment of the present invention
   comprises: a wind collection part and an energy conversion part, the wind power generation tower

   power turbine may be a gyro mill type wind power turbine. A distance of the wind passage may be
   1.5 m.
            Embodiments of the present invention have the advantage of providing a technology on a
   wind power generation tower which generates wind power even at a low speed and shows a
   maximum wind power generation efficiency.
            The wind power generation tower according to an embodiment of the present invention can
   realize wind power generation by accelerating wind even when the speed of the wind is low, and
15 can improve entire power generation efficiency by increasing a use efficiency of wind rotating
   blades, thereby improving overall power generation efficiency.
            In addition, the wind power generation tower according to an embodiment of the present
   invention can strengthen the strength of wind due to a Venturi effect and accelerate rotation of
   blades installed in an interior of a cylindrical wind power generation tower by making larger a
20 pressure drop of the wind withdrawing from the wind power generation tower using vortices
   generated on a rear surface of the wind power generation tower.

   a distance change of a wind passage in the wind power generation tower according to the present
   invention.
   Mode for Invention
 5          Hereinafter, a wind power generation tower according to the present invention will be
   described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.
            The applicant according to the present invention suggests a wind power generation tower
   having a plurality of layers (or tiers) of wind collection parts for amplifying wind strength while
   controlling the direction of wind as a measure for further amplifying strength of wind while more
10 effectively concentrating the direction of wind in the surrounding air. FIG. 1 shows the wind power
   generation tower, and as shown in FIG. 1,the wind power generation tower 100 according to the
   present invention may have a plurality of layers of wind collection parts 110 including a plurality of
   wind inlets 111. Meanwhile, the wind flowing to the wind power generation tower 100 may pass
   through the wind inlets 111 of the wind power generation tower 110, or as shown in the drawings,
15 may flow along both side (surfaces) and an upper side of the wind power generation tower 100. In
   this case, vortices (swirling flows) may be generated on a rear surface (side) of the wind power
   generation tower 100. The vortices generated on a rear surface of the wind power generation tower
   100 are generated as long as the wind power generation tower 100 has a predetermined height and a
   predetermined volume irrespective of the shape of the wind power generation tower 100, but when
20 the cross-section of the wind power genemtion tower 100 generally has a circular shape, vortices are
   generated on a side opposite to the side where wind is introduced into the wind power generation
   tower 100. Accordingly, the wind power genemtion tower 100 according to the present invention
   may have a cylindrical shape.
            FIG. 2 shows a cross-section of one layer of the wind power genemtion tower according to
25 the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2, the wind power generation tower 100 according to the
   present invention may have a wind collection part 110 and an energy conversion part 150. As
   described above, the wind collection part 110 may be formed by disposing a plurality of wind guide
   walls 120 radially with respect to the center of the wind power generation tower 100 such that the
   cross-sections of a wind inlet 111 and a wind outlet 112 are different from each other by a
30 predetermined level or more so that the direction of the wind introduced into the wind inlet 111 of
   the wind power generation tower 100 may be controlled and the strength of the wind may be
   amplified. Here, the difference between the cross-sections of the wind inlet 111 and the wind outlet
   112 may be formed such that wind speed is increased by a Venturi effect at a low wind speed of 5
   m/s or less.
                                                        4
                                                                                9986936_1(GHMatters) P102035.AU.1 15/02/2018

             FIG. 3 shows power generation outputs for the cross-sections of the wind inlet 111 and the
   wind outlet 112 of the wind collection part 110. FIG. 3 shows a result obtained by experimenting
   with an actual tower installed in Jeju Island (Korea) by the applicant, in which a wind power
   generator having a rated output of 6 KW was experimented with, and when the ratio of the cross
 5 sections of the wind inlet 111 and the wind outlet 112 was changed to 1:1 or more, a cross-section
   ratio by which a suitable Venturi effect can be achieved was sought by measuring an output
   measured by the wind power generator installed in the actual tower. It can be seen in the
   experimental result that an output of 5 KW or more, which is admitted as commercial power when
   the ratio of cross-sections of the wind inlet 111 and the wind outlet 112 is about 2.5:1, is generated,
10 considering that a range of an output admitted as commercial power is about 5 KW in a wind power
   generator. Accordingly, an effect of increasing the speed of wind in the wind collection part 110 of
   the wind power generation tower 100 can be realized by setting the ratio of the cross-sections of the
   wind inlet 111 and the wind outlet 112 of the wind collection part 110 installed in the wind power
   generation tower 100 according to the present invention to a minimum of about 2.5:1.
15           It is preferable that the wind guide walls 120 are designed to have a suitable number of
   wind inlets 111 such that the wind introduced into the wind power generation tower 100 is
   effectively discharged to the outside. Accordingly, in the wind power generation tower 100
   according to the present invention, the wind introduced into the wind power generation tower 100
   may be effectively discharged to the outside by installing at least five to nine wind guide walls 110.
20           A vertical shaft (axis) type wind power turbine is installed in the energy conversion part 150
   formed in a central space of each of the layers of the wind power generation tower 100. The vertical
   shaft type wind power turbine installed in the wind power generation tower 100 according to the
   present invention may be either a drag type wind power turbine or a lift type wind power turbine.
   Meanwhile, a lift type wind power turbine is installed as the vertical shaft type wind power turbine
25 in the embodiment of the present invention, and will be described based on an embodiment in which
   a gyro mill type wind power turbine 130 is installed. FIG. 4 shows an embodiment of the gyro mill
   type wind power turbine 130, and the gyro mill type wind power turbine may include a central shaft
   131, a gyro mill type wind power blade 133 having a streamlined shape and rotated by a lifting
   force, and a support shaft 132 connecting the central shaft 131 and the gyro mill type wind power
30 blade 133.
             The energy conversion part 150 is a space for converting wind energy into mechanical
   energy while the wind having passed through the wind collection part 110 passes through the
   energy conversion part 150, and may include a wind passage 151 defined by a space between the
   gyro mill wind power blade 133 and an end of the wind guide wall 120, and an inner passage 152
35 defined as a space between the central shaft 131 of the gyro mill type wind power turbine 130 and
                                                        5
                                                                                9986936_1(GHMatters) P102035.AU.1 15/02/2018

   the gyro mill type wind power blade 133, with respect to the gyro mill type wind power blade 133
   of the gyro mill type wind power turbine 130.
             The gyro mill type wind power turbine 130 is technically similar to a Darrieus wind power
   turbine in that it is driven by a lifting force, but the solidity of the gyro mill type wind power turbine
 5 130 is higher than that of the Darrieus wind power turbine and TSR (Tip Speed Ratio) thereof is
   lower than that of the Darrieus wind power turbine in that the gyro mill type wind power turbine 130
   is formed such that the gyro mill type wind power blade 133 is streamlined and has a finite length.
   Here, the solidity of a wind power turbine refers to a ratio of a length occupied by a blade to a
   rotation radius of the blade at any predetermined radial position, and the TSR refers to a ratio of a
10 speed of wind to a speed of an end of a blade. That is, if the speed of wind and the speed of an end
   (tip) of a blade are the same, the TSR is 1.
             Meanwhile, because the solidity of the gyro mill type wind power turbine 130 according to
   the embodiment of the present invention is considembly high unlike the Darrieus wind power
   turbine, lifting force is considerably decreased as the TSR increases due to an interference between
15 the gyro mill type wind power blades 133 and a reduction of the speed of the wind introduced to the
   blades located at a downstream side of the gyro mill type wind power blades 133.
             Accordingly, the applicant improved the structure of the wind power generation tower 100
   according to the present invention to maximally overcome the disadvantages while strengthening
   the technical advantages. In more detail, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 5,the plurality of wind guide
20 walls 120 may be inclined at a constant (or the same) angle along the center of the wind power
   generation tower 100 such that the wind introduced through the wind inlets 111 can flow in a radial
   direction of the energy conversion part 150. Accordingly, as shown in the drawings, the wind
   having passed through the wind collection part 110 flows through a wind passage 151 along a dial
   direction of the energy conversion part 150. In addition, it is important that the energy conversion
25 part 150 of the wind power generation tower 100 according to the embodiment of the present
   invention is designed to have a wind passage 151 large enough to smoothly rotate the gyro mill type
   wind power blade 133.
             Because the gyro mill type wind power blades 133 are rotated by a lifting force unlike the
   drag type vertical shaft turbine according to the related art, front and rear ends of the gyro mill type
30 wind power blades 133 require space through which wind sufficiently flows. Accordingly, the
   present invention is designed such that a space between the central shaft 133 of the gyro mill type
   wind power turbine 130 and the gyro mill type wind power blades 133 is defined as an inner
   passage 152 and a space between the gyro mill type wind power blades 133 and the wind guide
   walls 120 of the wind collection part 110 is defined as a wind passage 151, and the space through
35 which wind can sufficiently flow is secured through the wind passage 151.
                                                           6
                                                                                   9986936_1(GHMatters) P102035.AU.1 15/02/2018

              FIGS. 2 and 5 show the technical features of the present invention. Referring to FIGS. 2 and
   5, the wind having passed through the wind collection part 110 may flow along the wind passage
   151 formed in a radial direction of the energy conversion part 150. In addition, the energy
   conversion part 150 of the wind power genemtion tower 100 according to the present invention can
 5 restrain the speeds of the blades from being decreased by a drag force generated at a downstream
   side of the gyro mill wind power turbine 130 according to the related art because the energy
   conversion part 150 of the wind power genemtion tower 100 according to the present invention
   rarely generates wind flows at an opposite radial direction thereof
              Furthermore, in the wind power generation tower 100 according to the present invention, it
10 is most important to properly set the distance of the wind passage 151 in order to effectively increase
   the rotation efficiency of the gyro mill type wind power turbine 130 installed in the energy
   conversion part 150. Meanwhile, in order to properly set the distance of the wind passage 151, the
   speed change of the wind passing through the wind outlets 112 is measured when the wind passing
   through the wind outlets 112 of the wind collection part 110 contacts the gyro mill type wind power
15 blades 133, results of which are shown in FIGS. 6A to 6D. The distance of the wind passage 151 is
   0.3 m in FIG. 6A, 0.7 m in FIG. 6B, 1 m in FIG. 6C, and 1.5 m in FIG. 6D. Referring to the
   drawings, it can be seen that the speed of the wind discharged through the wind outlets 112 changes
   according to the distance change of the wind passage 151. In more detail, it can be seen that a
   resistance of the passage decreases as the distance of the wind passage 151 increases such that the
20 speed of the wind discharged through the wind outlets 112 increases. According to the experimental
   result, it can be seen that the resistance of the passage considerably decreases if the distance of the
   wind passage 151 becomes about 1.0 m or more. It can be seen that the speed of the wind
   discharged through the wind outlets 112 at a distance of about 1.5 m reaches a maximum point
   Accordingly, according to the above-described result, the wind power generation tower according to
25 the present invention is designed such that the distance of the wind passage 151 formed in the
   energy conversion part 150 of the wind power generation tower 100 is at least 1.0 m.
              As described above, when the distance of the wind passage 151 is properly set, the gyro
   mill type wind power turbine 130 installed within the energy conversion part 150 is rotated while
   minimizing the resistance of the wind discharged through the wind outlets 112 of the wind
30 collection part 110, and it is most important to properly set the distance of the wind passage 151 of
   the wind power generation tower 100 according to the present invention because the wind power
   generation tower 110 has a sufficient wind flow space through which the lift blades can generate a
   rotating force.
              Meanwhile, as described above, the wind passage 151 formed in the energy conversion part

   further increase the strength of the wind in the energy conversion part 150 of the wind power
   generation tower 100 through the flow of the wind generated by the wind power generation tower
   100, in addition to the purpose of forming a flow ofwind for smoothly genemting a lifting force of
   the wind power blades 133 of the gyro mill type wind power turbines 130. FIG. 1 exemplarily
 5 shows a flow of the wind flowing through the wind power generation tower 100 according to the
   present invention, and the wind flowing through the wind power genemtion tower 100 may be wind
   flowing on both side surfaces and an upper surface of the wind power generation tower 100 in
   addition to the wind flowing through the interior of the wind power generation tower 100 via the
   wind inlets 111 of the wind collection part 110. In this case, as shown in FIG. 2, vortices having a
10 relatively low pressure are generated on a side opposite to a side through which the wind of the wind
   power generation tower 100 is introduced. Accordingly, the wind discharged to the outside through
   the interior of the wind power generation tower 100 experiences a larger pressure drop due to the
   vortices, and thus the wind flowing along the wind passage 151 in the interior of the wind power
   generation tower 100 may be discharged to the outside of the wind power generation tower 100 at a
15 more rapid speed.
             In more detail, the wind discharged in an opposite direction of the wind power generation
   tower 100 via the wind passage 151 in the energy conversion part 150 generates a considerably
   large pressure difference between the energy conversion part 150 and the wind discharge space in
   which the vortices are formed due to the vortices formed in the wind discharge space at a side
20 opposite to the side of the wind power generation tower 100, and the strength of the wind passing
   through the wind passage 151 of the energy conversion part 150 may be increased. Accordingly, the
   wind flowing along the wind passage 151 of the energy conversion part 150 is influenced by the
   pressure difference generated by the above-described vortices, and the effect considembly influences
   the rotating force of the gyro mill type wind power blades formed in the energy conversion part 150.
25           Accordingly, as described above, in order to improve the efficiency of the vertical shaft
   wind power turbine installed within the energy conversion part 150 using the vortices generated
   according to the flow of the wind generated by the wind power genemtion tower 100, it is necessary
   to install the wind passage 151 in the energy conversion part 150. If the wind passage 151 is not
   properly installed in the energy conversion part 150, the effect of increasing the strength of the wind
30 flowing in the energy conversion part 150 generated by the pressure difference due to the wind
   generated by the wind power generation tower 100 does not influence the rotating force of the
   vertical shaft wind power turbine installed in the energy conversion part 150.
             Accordingly, as described above, the wind passage formed in the energy conversion part
   150 of the wind power generation tower 100 according to the present invention can cause a smooth
35 rotating force of the gyro mill type wind power turbine 130, and can increase the strength of the
                                                       8

   wind due to a pressure drop generated by vortices generated by a flow of wind flowing along the
   wind power generation tower 100.
             The wind power generation tower 100 including a gyro mill type wind power turbine
   according to the present invention employs the gyro mill type wind power turbine 130, which is a
 5 vertical shaft wind power turbine, in the wind power generation tower 100, and according to the
   present invention, efficiency can be increased by about 50% or more as compared to the case in
   which the vertical shaft wind power turbine according to the related art is rotated in the surrounding
   air. This increases a flow rate and a strength of wind flowing through the energy conversion part 150
   through the configurations of the wind collection part 110 and the energy conversion part 150 in
10 addition to an effect of increasing the strength of the wind due to the Venturi effect of the wind
   collection part 110, thereby increasing energy applied to the gyro mill type wind power turbine 130
   and the wind in the energy conversion part 150 can be made to more rapidly flow by the pressure
   difference due to the vortices generated by the flow of the wind directly generated by the wind
   power generation tower 100, so that the above-described effects can be achieved.
15           Meanwhile, although it has been described that the gyro mill type wind power turbine 130
   is installed as the vertical shaft wind power turbine installed in the wind power generation tower
   100, the technical feature of the present invention is not limited to the gyro mill type wind power
   turbine 130 and the present invention also may be applied to various vertical shaft wind power
   turbines installed in the wind power generation tower 100.
20           Although the exemplary embodiment of the present invention has been described, it will be
   appreciated by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be variously modified and
   changed by adding, changing, or removing constituent components without departing from the
   scope of the present invention described in the claims and the modifications or changes fall within
   the scope of the present invention.
25           It is to be understood that, if any prior art is referred to herein, such reference does not
   constitute an admission that such prior art forms a part of the common general knowledge in the art,
   in Austmlia or any other country.
