  5            This invention was made with government support under Grant Nos. A1096040 and A1084794,

                                               Background of the Invention
 10           Vaccines that elicit cellular immune responses against viruses seek to reflect global viral diversity
    in order to effectively treat or prevent viral infection. For HIV vaccines, the initiation of robust and diverse
    human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific T cell responses is desirable for an effective HIV vaccine.
    The highly variable Envelope protein (Env) is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies against HIV,
    and vaccine antigens may be tailored accordingly to elicit these antibody responses. To this end,
 15 immunogens mimicking the trimeric structure of Env on the native HIV virion are actively being pursued
    as antibody-based HIV vaccines. However, it has proven difficult to produce biochemically stable trimeric
    Env immunogens that elicit diverse neutralizing antibody responses.
              Thus, there is an unmet need in the field for the development of vaccines that include novel,
    optimized trimeric Env immunogens, which can elicit broadly neutralizing antibody responses in order to
 M0 allow for more successful HIV vaccination outcomes.
                                                 Summary of the Invention
               In a first aspect, the invention features a stabilized trimer having three gp140 polypeptides in
    which at least one (e.g., two or each) of the gp140 polypeptides includes an amino acid sequence having
 ?5 at least 90% identity (e.g., at least 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%. 97%, 98%, or 99% identity) to, or
    the sequence of, SEQ ID NO: 2 (mEnv+).
               In a related second aspect, the invention features a stabilized trimer having three gp140
    polypeptides in which at least one (e.g., two or each) of the gp140 polypeptides includes an amino acid
    sequence having substantially the sequence of (e.g., 99% or more identity), or the sequence of, SEQ ID
30   NO: 1 (mEnv) or SEQ ID NO: 3 (cEnv).
               In some embodiments, the stabilized trimers are heterotrimers. The stabilized polypeptide
    heterotrimers may include two mosaic Env1 gp140 polypeptides (e.g., mEnv and/or mEnv+) each
    including an amino acid sequence having at least 90% identity (e.g., at least 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%,
    96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity) to, or the sequence of, SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2, and one clade C Env gp140
35   polypeptide (e.g., "cEnv" having SEQ ID NO: 3) including an amino acid sequence having at least 90%
     identity (e.g., at least 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity) to, or the sequence
    of, SEQ ID NO: 3 (cEnv) (e.g., two mEnv and one cEnv; two mEnv+ and one cEnv; or one mEnv, one
     mEnv+, and one cEnv). In other embodiments, the stabilized heterotrimers may include one mosaic Env1
    gp140 polypeptide (e.g., mEnv and/or mEnv+) including an amino acid sequence having at least 90%
40   identity (e.g., at least 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity) to, or the sequence
                                                               1

        WO 2014/107744                                                                    PCT/US2014/010543
    of, SEQ ID NO: I or 2, and two clade C Env gp140 polypeptides (e.g., cEnv) each including an amino
    acid sequence having at least 90% (e.g., at least 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%
    identity) to, or the sequence of, SEQ ID NO: 3 (e.g., one mEnv and two cEnv; one mEnv+ and two cEnv).
    In some embodiments, the stabilized heterotrimer includes a combination of two different mosaic Env1
  5 sequences (e.g., one mEnv and two mEnv+; two mEnv and one mEnv+-; or one mEnv, one mEnv+, and
    cEnv). In some embodiments, the stabilized heterotrimer includes cEnv and two of the same Env1
    polypeptides (e.g., two mEnv and one cEnv; two mEnv+ and one cEnv). In other embodiments, the
    stabilized heterotrimer includes one cEnv and two different mosaic Env1 polypeptides (e.g., one cEnv,
    one mEnv, and one mEnv+). In yet other embodiments, the stabilized heterotrimer includes two cEnv
  0 polypeptides and one mosaic Env1 polypeptide (e.g., two cEnv and one mEnv; or two cEnv and one
    mEnv+).
              Alternatively, stabilized gp140 Env trimers can be prepared in which one or two of the gp140 Env
    polypeptides in the trimer has a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4 (mosaic gp140 Env2, "mEnv2") or SEQ ID
    NO: 5 (mosaic gp140 Env3, "mEnv3). In another embodiment said stabilized trimers have three gp140
  5 polypeptides in which at least one (e.g., two or each) of the gp140 polypeptides includes an amino acid
    sequence having at least 90% identity (e.g., at least 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%
    identity) to, or the sequence of, SEQ ID NO: 4 or 5. Preferably, mEnv2 or mEnv3 is modified in a similar
    manner to that of mEnv, mEnv+, or cEnv, which each possess a trimerization domain, as discussed
    herein below. Therefore, in some embodiments of the invention, stabilized gp140 Env trimers can be
  0 prepared which have the following constituent polypeptides: one mEnv and two mEnv2; two mEnv and
    one mEnv2; one mEnv+ and two mEnv2; two mEnv+ and one mEnv2; one cEnv and two mEnv2; two
    cEnv and one mEnv2; one mEnv, one mEnv+, and one mEnv2; one mEnv, one cEnv, and mEnv2; one
    mEnv+, one cEnv, and one mEnv2; one mEnv and two mEnv3; two mEnv and one mEnv3; one mEnv+
    and two mEnv3; two mEnv+ and one mEnv3; one cEnv and two mEnv3; two cEnv and one mEnv3; one
 .5 mEnv, one mEnv+, and one mEnv3; one mEnv, one cEnv, and mEnv3; one mEnv+, one cEnv, and one
    mEnv3; one mEnv, one mEnv2, and one mEnv3; one mEnv+, one mEnv2, and one mEnv3; or one cEnv,
    one mEnv2, and one mEnv3.
              In a third aspect, the invention features a composition including a stabilized trimer of the first or
    second aspect. In an embodiment, the composition of the third aspect includes one or more different
30  stabilized trimer(s). In other embodiments, the different stabilized trimer(s) has three gp140 polypeptides
    in which at least one (e.g., two or each) of the gp140 polypeptides comprises an amino acid sequence
    having at least 90% identity (e.g., at least 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity)
    to, or the sequence of, SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. In other embodiments, the different stabilized
    trimer(s) may be a homotrimer or a heterotrimer. In some embodiments, the compositions of the third
35  aspect further include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient, or diluent, and/or an adjuvant.
              In a fourth aspect, the invention features a vaccine including any one of the compositions of the

    immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a subject in need thereof. In some embodiments, the vaccine
    elicits production of neutralizing anti-HIV antisera (e.g., neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antisera) after
40  administration to the subject. The anti-HIV antisera can neutralize HIV (e.g., HIV-1), for example,
    selected from any one or more of clade A, clade B, and clade C.

                                                          Definitions
              As used herein, the term "about" means +/- 10% of the recited value.
              By "adenovirus" is meant a medium-sized (90-100 nm), non-enveloped icosahedral virus that
    includes a capsid and a double-stranded linear DNA genome. The adenovirus can be a naturally
  5 occurring, but isolated, adenovirus (e.g., sAd4287, sAd4310A, or sAd4312) or a recombinant adenovirus
    (e.g., replication-defective or replication competent sAd4287, sAd4310A, or sAd4312 or a chimeric
    variant thereof).
              As used herein, "administering" is meant a method of giving a dosage of a pharmaceutical
    composition (e.g., a composition of the invention, such as any one of the vaccines of the first or fourth
 0  aspects, the compositions of the third aspect, the nucleic acid molecules of the fifth aspect, and/or the
    vectors of the sixth aspect) to a subject. The compositions utilized in the methods described herein can
    be administered, for example, intramuscularly, intravenously, intradermally, percutaneously,
    intraarterially, intraperitoneally, intralesionally, intracranially, intraarticularly, intraprostatically,
    intrapleurally, intratracheally, intranasally, intravitreally, intravaginally, intrarectally, topically,
 5  intratumorally, peritoneally, subcutaneously, subconjunctivally, intravesicularlly, mucosally,
    intrapericardially, intraumbilically, intraocularly, orally, topically, locally, by inhalation, by injection, by
    infusion, by continuous infusion, by localized perfusion bathing target cells directly, by catheter, by
    lavage, by gavage, in cremes, or in lipid compositions. The preferred method of administration can vary
    depending on various factors (e.g., the components of the composition being administered and the
  0 severity of the condition being treated).
              As used herein, the term "clade" refers to related human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs)
    classified according to their degree of genetic similarity. There are currently three groups of HIV41
    isolates: M, N and 0. Group M (major strains) consists of at least ten clades, A through J. Group 0
    (outer strains) may consist of a similar number of clades. Group N is a new HIV-1 isolate that has not
 .5 been categorized in either group M or 0. In certain exemplary embodiments, a composition of the
    invention (e.g., any one of the vaccines of the first or fourth aspects, the compositions of the third aspect,
    the nucleic acid molecules of the fifth aspect, and/or the vectors of the sixth aspect) as described herein
    will recognize and raise an immune response (e.g., neutralizing anti-HIV antisera) against two, three, four,
    five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten or more clades and/or two or more groups of HIV.
30            Throughout this specification and claims, the word "comprise," or variations such as "comprises"
    or "comprising," will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not
    the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.
              As used herein, the term "envelope glycoprotein" refers, but is not limited to, the glycoprotein that
    is expressed on the surface of the envelope of HIV virions and the surface of the plasma membrane of
35  HIV infected cells. The env gene encodes gp160, which is proteolytically cleaved into the gp120 and
    gp4l Envelope (Env) proteins. Gp120 binds to the CD4 receptor on a target cell that has such a
    receptor, such as, e.g., a T-helper cell. Gp4l is non-covalently bound to gp120, and provides the second
    step by which HIV enters the cell. It is originally buried within the viral envelope, but when gp120 binds to
    a CD4 receptor, gp120 changes its conformation causing gp4l to become exposed, where it can assist in
40  fusion with the host cell.
                                                                6

        WO 2014/107744                                                                     PCT/US2014/010543
             By "gene product" is meant to include mRNAs transcribed from a gene as well as polypeptides
    translated from those mRNAs.
             By "heterologous nucleic acid molecule" or "heterologous gene" is meant any exogenous nucleic
    acid molecule (e.g., a nucleic acid molecule encoding an optimized gp140 Env polypeptide of the
  5 invention) that can be inserted into the a vector of the invention (e.g., an adenovirus or poxvirus vector)
    for transfer into a cell, tissue, or organism, for subsequent expression of a gene product of interest or
    fragment thereof encoded by the heterologous nucleic acid molecule or gene. In a preferred
    embodiment, the heterologous nucleic acid molecule, which can be administered to a cell or subject as
    part of the present invention, can include, but is not limited to, a nucleic acid molecule encoding at least
 10 one optimized mosaic Env polypeptide (e.g., a mosaic Env1 polypeptide, such as mEnv and mEnv+)
    and/or a clade C Env polypeptide (e.g., a clade C Env1 polypeptide, such as cEnv).
             By "human immunodeficiency virus" or "HIV" is meant a virus of the genus Lentivirinae, part of the
    family of Retroviridae, and includes, but is not limited to, HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV type 2 (HIV-2), two
    species of HIV that infect humans.
 15          By "immune response" is meant any response to an antigen or antigenic determinant by the
    immune system of a subject (e.g., a human). Exemplary immune responses include humoral immune
    responses (e.g., production of antigen-specific antibodies, e.g., neutralizing antibodies (NAbs)) and cell
    mediated immune responses (e.g., lymphocyte proliferation).
             As used herein, the term "reducing" with respect to HIV refers to a reduction or decrease of an
 !0 HIV-mediated activity (e.g., infection, fusion (e.g., target cell entry and/or syncytia formation), viral spread,
    etc.) and/or a decrease in viral titer. HIV-mediated activity and/or HIV titer may be decreased by 5%,
    10%, 15%, 20 %, 25%, 30%, 35%1 40            45%, 50%, 55% 60%, 65%, 70% 75% 80%/ 81% 82% 83%.
    84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.1 %,
    99.2%, 99.3%, 99.4%, 99.5%, 99.6%, 99.7%, 99.8%, 99.9% or more compared to that of a control subject
  5 (e.g., an untreated subject or a subject treated with a placebo).
             By "neutralizing antibody" or "NAb" is meant an antibody which either is purified from, or is
    present in, serum and which recognizes a specific antigen (e.g., HIV Env glycoprotein, such as a gp140
    polypeptide or a gp120 polypeptide) and inhibits the effect(s) of the antigen in the host (e.g., a human).
    As used herein, the antibody can be a single antibody or a plurality of antibodies.
30           "Nucleic acid" or "polynucleotide," as used interchangeably herein, refer to polymers of
    nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides,
    ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be
    incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase, or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide
    may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present,
35  modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The
    sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be
    further modified after synthesis, such as by conjugation with a label. Other types of modifications include,
    for example, "caps," substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog,
    internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl
40  phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g.,
    phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example,
                                                             7

        WO 2014/107744                                                                   PCT/US2014/010543
   proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, poly-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators
   (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron,
   oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric
   nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl
 5 groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate
   groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional
   nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid or semi-solid supports. The 5' and 3' terminal OH can be
   phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon
   atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also
10 contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for
   example, 2'-O-methyl-, 2'-O-allyl, 2'-fluoro- or 2'-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, alpha-anomeric
   sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars,
   sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs and a basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more
   phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups
15 include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O)S("thioate"), P(S)S
   ("dithioate"), "(O)NR 2 ("amidate"), P(O)R, P(O)OR', CO or CH 2 ("formacetal"), in which each R or R' is
   independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (-0-) linkage,
   aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical.
   The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.
20            By "optimized" is meant an immunogenic polypeptide that is not a naturally-occurring peptide,
   polypeptide, or protein, such as a non-naturally occurring viral polypeptide (e.g., a gp140 polypeptide of
   the invention). Optimized viral polypeptide sequences are initially generated by modifying the amino acid
   sequence of one or more naturally-occurring viral gene products (e.g., peptides, polypeptides, and
   proteins, e.g., a viral Env polypeptide, e.g., a viral Env1, Env2, and/or Env3 polypeptide) to increase the
25 breadth, intensity, depth, or longevity of the antiviral immune response (e.g., cellular or humoral immune
   responses) generated upon immunization (e.g., when incorporated into a composition of the invention,
   e.g., vaccine of the invention) of a subject (e.g., a human). Thus, the optimized viral polypeptide may
   correspond to a "parent" viral gene sequence; alternatively, the optimized viral polypeptide may not
   correspond to a specific "parent" viral gene sequence but may correspond to analogous sequences from
30 various strains or quasi-species of a virus. Modifications to the viral gene sequence that can be included
   in an optimized viral polypeptide include amino acid additions, substitutions, and deletions. In one
   embodiment of the invention, the optimized polypeptide is a mosaic envelope protein, such as mosaic
    Env1 gp140 (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012/0076812, herein incorporated by reference), or
   an optimized version thereof, which has been further altered to include a leader/signal sequence for
35  maximal protein expression, cleavage site mutation(s), a factor Xa site, and/or a foldon trimerization
   domain (see, e.g., SEQ ID NO: 2). Methods of generating an optimized viral polypeptide are described
    in, e-g., Fisher et al. "Polyvalent Vaccine for Optimal Coverage of Potential T-Cell Epitopes in Global HIV
    1 Variants," Nat. Med. 13(1):100-106 (2007) and International Patent Application Publication WO
   2007/024941, herein incorporated by reference. Once the optimized viral polypeptide sequence is
40 generated, the corresponding polypeptide can be produced or administered by standard techniques (e.g.,
    recombinant viral vectors, such as the adenoviral vectors disclosed in International Patent Application
                                                            8

        WO 2014/107744                                                                    PCT/US2014/010543
    Publications WO 2006/040330 and WO 2007/104792, herein incorporated by reference) and optionally
    assembled in conjunction with one or more other viral polypeptides of the invention to form a stabilized
    polypeptide trimer.
              By "pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, excipient, carrier, or adjuvant" is meant a diluent,
 5  excipient, carrier, or adjuvant which is physiologically acceptable to the subject while retaining the
    therapeutic properties of the pharmaceutical composition with which it is administered. One exemplary
    pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is physiological saline. Other physiologically acceptable diluents,
    excipients, carriers, or adjuvants and their formulations are known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., U.S.
    Pub. No. 2012/0076812).
 0            By "recombinant," with respect to a composition (e.g., a vector of the invention, such as an
    adenovirus or poxvirus vector), is meant a composition that has been manipulated in vitro (e.g., using
    standard cloning techniques) to introduce changes (e.g., changes to the composition, e.g., adenovirus or
    poxvirus genome of an adenovirus or poxvirus vector, respectively) that enable binding to or containment
    of a therapeutic agent and/or that promote the introduction of a therapeutic agent into a subject (e.g., a
 5  human) or a host cell. The recombinant composition of the invention may therefore be an adenoviral or
    poxviral transport vector (e.g., a replication-defective adenoviral or poxviral vector) for delivery of one or
    more of the stabilized Env polypeptide trimers of the invention.
              By "sequence identity" or "sequence similarity" is meant that the identity or similarity between two
    or more amino acid sequences, or two or more nucleotide sequences, is expressed in terms of the
 .0 identity or similarity between the sequences. Sequence identity can be measured in terms of "percentage
    (%) identity," wherein the higher the percentage, the more identity shared between the sequences.
    Sequence similarity can be measured in terms of percentage similarity (which takes into account
    conservative amino acid substitutions); the higher the percentage, the more similarity shared between the
    sequences. Homologs or orthologs of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences possess a relatively high
 .5 degree of sequence identity/similarity when aligned using standard methods. Sequence identity may be
    measured using sequence analysis software on the default setting (e.g., Sequence Analysis Software
    Package of the Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center, 1710
    University Avenue, Madison, WI 53705). Such software may match similar sequences by assigning
    degrees of homology to various substitutions, deletions, and other modifications.
30            As used herein, the term "stabilized polypeptide trimer" refers, but is not limited to, an oligomer
    that includes a protein and/or polypeptide sequence that increases the stability (e.g., via the presence of
    one or more oligomerization domains) of the trimeric structure (e.g., reduces dissociation of a trimer into
    monomeric units). In particular, the stabilized polypeptide trimer is composed of three mosaic Env
    proteins (e.g., Env1, Env2, and/or Env3), three clade C Env proteins, or a combination of one or more
35  mosaic Env proteins and one or more clade C Env proteins, in which at least one Env protein includes an
    oligomerization domain. An "oligomerization domain" refers, but is not limited to, a polypeptide sequence
    that can be used to increase the stability of an oligomeric envelope protein such as, e.g., to increase the
    stability of a HIV gp140 trimer. Oligomerization domains can be used to increase the stability of
    homooligomeric polypeptides as well as heterooligomeric polypeptides. Oligomerization domains are well
40  known in the art, and include "trimerization domains."     A trimerization domain refers to an oligomerization
    domain that stabilizes trimeric polypeptides (e.g., trimers consisting of one or more of the gp140
                                                            9

         WO 2014/107744                                                                     PCT/US2014/010543
    polypeptides of the invention). Examples of trimerization domains include, but are not limited to, the T4
    fibritin "foldon" trimerization domain; the coiled-coil trimerization domain derived from GCN4 (Yang et al.
    (2002) J. Virol. 76:4634); and the catalytic subunit of E. coli aspartate transcarbamoylase as a trimer tag
    (Chen et al. (2004) J. Virol. 78:4508).
  5            A "subject" is a vertebrate, such as a mammal (e.g., a human). Mammals also include, but are
    not limited to, farm animals (such as cows), sport animals (e.g., horses), pets (such as cats and dogs),
    mice, and rats. A subject to be treated according to the methods described herein (e.g., a subject having
    an HIV infection or a subject at risk of an HIV infection) may be one who has been diagnosed by a
    medical practitioner as having such a condition. Diagnosis may be performed by any suitable means. A
 10 subject in whom the risk of an HIV infection is to be reduced or prevented may or may not have received
    such a diagnosis. One skilled in the art will understand that a subject to be treated according to the
    present invention may have been subjected to standard tests or may have been identified, without
    examination, as one at high risk due to the presence of one or more risk factors (e.g., a needle stick or
    known exposure to HIV or an HIV infected individual).
 15            By "having substantially the sequence of" with respect to constructs of the invention is meant
    having at least 99% sequence identity to a recited reference sequence (e.g., having no more than 7
    amino acid residue differences, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 amino acid residue differences (e.g., additions,
    deletions, or conservative amino acid substitutions), relative to a recited reference sequence).
               By "therapeutically effective amount" isrmeant an amount of a therapeutic agent that alone, or
 !0 together with one or more additional (optional) therapeutic agents, produces beneficial or desired results
    upon administration to a mammal. The therapeutically effective amount depends upon the context in
    which the therapeutic agent Is applied. For example, in the context of administering, a-vaccine
    composition including a therapeutic agent such as a stabilized gp140 trimer of the invention, the
    therapeutically effective amount of the vaccine composition is an amount sufficient to achieve a reduction
 )5 in the level of HIV (e.g., as measured by a stabilization or decrease in HIV titer compared to a non-treated
    control), and/or an increase in the level of neutralizing anti-HIV antisera (e.g., as measured by an
     increase in serum neutralizing antibody levels relative to a non-treated control in a luciferase-based virus
     neutralization assay) as compared to a response obtained without administration of a composition of the
     invention (e.g., a vaccine composition), and/or to prevent the propagation of an infectious virus (e.g., HIV)
30   in a subject (e.g., a human) having an increased risk of viral infection. Ideally, a therapeutically effective
    amount provides a therapeutic effect without causing a substantial cytotoxic effect in the subject. In
    general, a therapeutically effective amount of a composition administered to a subject (e.g., a human) will
    vary depending upon a number of factors associated with that subject, for example the overall health of
    the subject, the condition to be treated, or the severity of the condition. A therapeutically effective amount
35  of a composition can be determined by varying the dosage of the product and measuring the resulting
    therapeutic response.
               As used herein, and as well understood in the art, "treatment" is an approach for obtaining
     beneficial or desired results, such as clinical results. Beneficial or desired results can include, but are not
     limited to, alleviation or amelioration of one or more symptoms or conditions; diminishment of extent of
40   disease, disorder, or condition; stabilization (i.e., not worsening) of a state of disease, disorder, or
     condition; prevention of spread of disease, disorder, or condition; delay or slowing the progress of the
                                                              10

        WO 2014/107744                                                                   PCT/US2014/010543
    disease, disorder, or condition; amelioration or palliation of the disease, disorder, or condition; and
    remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. "Palliating" a disease, disorder,
    or condition means that the extent and/or undesirable clinical manifestations of the disease, disorder, or
    condition are lessened and/or time course of the progression is slowed or lengthened, as compared to the
  5 extent or time course in the absence of treatment.
              The term "vaccine," as used herein, is defined as material used to provoke an immune response
    (e.g., the production of neutralizing anti-HIV antisera). Administration of the vaccine to a subject may
    confer at least partial immunity against HIV infection.
             As used herein, the term "vector" is meant to include, but is not limited to, a virus (e.g.,
  0 adenovirus or poxvirus), naked DNA, oligonucleotide, cationic lipid (e.g., liposome), cationic polymer
    (e.g., polysome), virosome, nanoparticle, or dentrimer. By "adenovirus vector" is meant a composition
    that includes one or more genes (non-structural or structural), or fragments thereof, from an adenoviral
    species (e.g., adenovirus serotype 11 (Ad1 1), adenovirus serotype 15 (Ad15), adenovirus serotype 24
    (Ad24), adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26), adenovirus serotype 34 (Ad34), adenovirus serotype 35 (Ad35),
  5 adenovirus serotype 48 (Ad48), adenovirus serotype 49 (Ad49), adenovirus serotype 50 (Ad50), Pan9
    (AdC68), or a chimeric variant thereof (e.g., adenovirus serotype 5 HVR48 (Ad5HVR48))) that may be
    used to transmit one or more heterologous genes (e.g., one or more of the optimized gp140 polypeptides
    of the invention) from a viral or non-viral source to a subject or a host. The nucleic acid material of the
    viral vector may be encapsulated, e.g., in a lipid membrane or by structural proteins (e.g., capsid
  0 proteins), that may include one or more viral polypeptides e g an envelope glycoprotein). The viral
    vector can be used to infect cells of a subject, which, in turn, promotes the translation of the heterologous
    gene(s) of the viral vector into a protein product (e.g., one or more of the gp4      nv polypeptides
    described herein, such that a stabilized trimer of the invention is formed).
              The term "virus," as used herein, is defined as an infectious agent that is unable to grow or
 .5 reproduce outside a host cell and that infects mammals (e.g., humans) or birds.
              Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following Detailed
    Description, the drawings, and the claims.

                                        Detailed Description of the Invention
             Most antibodies induced by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (e.g., HIV type 1 (H!V-1)) are
   ineffective at preventing initiation or spread of infection, as they are either non-neutralizing or narrowly
 5 isolate-specific. One of the biggest challenges in HIV vaccine development is to design a HIV envelope
   immunogen that can induce protective, neutralizing antibodies effective against the diverse HIV strains
   that characterize the global pandemic. Indeed, the generation of "broadly neutralizing" antibodies that
   recognize relatively conserved regions on the envelope glycoprotein are rare. The present invention is
   based in part on the discovery of stabilized trimeric HIV envelope (Env) proteins and combinations thereof
30 that elicit a surprisingly broad neutralizing antibody response in vivo.
   Stabilized gp140 Env Trimers of the Invention
             The invention features novel stabilized HIV gp140 Env polypeptide trimers. Stabilized trimers of
   the invention feature optimized gp140 Env polypeptides. These polypeptides may have, or may be
35 modified to include, one or more of the following domains and/or mutations. The gp140 Env polypeptide
   constituents may include a T4-fibritin "foldon" trimerization domain sequence to support stable trimer
   formation (see, e.g., Figures 1A, 1B, and 1C, depicting the amino acid sequences of mEnv (SEQ ID NO:
   1), mEnv+ (SEQ ID NO: 2), and cEnv (SEQ ID NO: 3), respectively, which each include a C-terminal
   trimerization domain). The optimized gp140 Env polypeptides may also include cleavage site mutations
40 to enhance stability, for example, by eliminating cleavage by a peptidase (see, e.g., Figures 1B and 1C,
   which depict the mutated residues as circled residues in the mEnv+ and cEnv amino acid sequence,
                                                            15

        WO 2014/107744                                                                     PCT/US2014/010543
    respectively, between the gp120 and gp41 moieties). The optimized gp140 Env polypeptides may
    additionally have a signal/leader sequence to maximize protein expression (see, e.g., the signal/leader
    sequence of mEnv+ or cEnv, demarcated in Figures 1B and 1C, respectively). Further, the optimized
    gp140 Env polypeptides may include a Factor Xa cleavage site (SRIEGR), which may, for example, be
  5 incorporated upstream of (N-terminal to) the trimerization domain (see. e.g., Figures 1B and 1C, which
    depict the location of the Factor Xa cleavage site in the amino acid sequence of mEnv+ and cEnv,
    respectively). As discussed herein below, the stabilized trimers of the invention are preferably
    homotrimers (e.g., trimers composed of three identical polypeptides). Heterotrimers (e.g., trimers
    composed of three polypeptides that are not all identical) of the invention are also envisioned.
 10           The stabilized trimers of the invention are preferably stabilized homotrimers that include, for
    example, three gp140 polypeptides, wherein each of the gp140 polypeptides includes an amino acid
    sequence having at least 90% identity (e.g., at least 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%
    identity) to, or the sequence of, SEQ ID NO: 2 (mEnv+). The invention also features stabilized
                                                                                   14 0
    homotrimers including three gp140 polypeptides, wherein each of said gp             polypeptides includes an
  5 amino acid sequence having substantially the sequence of (e.g., 99% or more identity), or the sequence
    of, SEQ ID NO: 1 (mEnv) or SEQ ID NO: 3 (cEnv) or SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 5. Exemplary
    homotrimers of the invention include Trimers 1, 2, and 3 in Table 1 below.
             Alternatively, the stabilized trimer of the invention may be a stabilized heterotrimer. For example,
    the stabilized trimer may be a stabilized heterotrimer that includes a combination of two different mosaic
 !0 Eni sequences (e.g., one mEn. and two mEnv+ two mEnv and one mEnv; orone mEn,                       one mEnv
    anc cEnv). in some instances, the stabilized heterotrimer includes cEnv an' two of the same Env
    polypeptides 'e.g., two mEnv and one cEnv; two mEnv+ and one cEnj. in other instance               the stabilized
    heterotrimer includes one cEnv and two different mosaic EnvI polypeptides (e.g, one cEnv, one mEnv,
    and one mEnv+).
  5          Alternatively, the stabilized heterotrimer may include one, two or three constituent Env
    polypeptides including an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4 (mosaic gp140 Env2, "mEnv2") or SEQ
    ID NO: 5 (mosaic gp140 Env3, "mEnv3"). Preferably, mEnv2 or mEnv3 is modified in a similar manner to
    that of mEnv, mEnv+, or cEnv, which each possess a trimerization domain, as discussed above and as
    depicted in Figures 1A-1C. Therefore, other stabilized heterotrimers of the invention include trimers
30  having the following constituent polypeptides: one mEnv and two mEnv2; two mEnv and one mEnv2; one
    mEnv+ and two mEnv2; two mEnv+ and one mEnv2; one cEnv and two mEnv2; two cEnv and one
    mEnv2; one mEnv, one mEnv+, and one mEnv2; one mEnv, one cEnv, and mEnv2; one mEnv+, one
    cEnv, and one mEnv2; one mEnv and two mEnv3; two mEnv and one mEnv3; one mEnv+ and two
    mEnv3; two mEnv+ and one mEnv3; one cEnv and two mEnv3; two cEnv and one mEnv3; one mEnv,
35  one mEnv+, and one mEnv3; one mEnv, one cEnv, and mEnv3; one mEnv+, one cEnv, and one mEnv3;

   described herein and above. The vaccine may be used for treating or reducing the risk of a human
   immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a subject in need thereof. For example, the vaccine may elicit
   production of neutralizing anti-HIV antisera (e.g., neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antisera) after administration to
30 the subject. The anti-HIV antisera may also be able to neutralize HIV (e.g., HIV-1), for example, selected
   from any one or more of clade A, clade B, and clade C.
   Nucleic Acid Molecules of the Invention
             In some embodiments, the vaccines of the invention include one or more nucleic acid molecules
35 of the invention, such as a nucleic acid molecule having a nucleotide sequence that encodes a gp140
   polypeptide, in which the gp140 polypeptide includes (a) an amino acid sequence having at least 95%
   identity (e.g., 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identity) to SEQ ID NO: 1, (b) an amino acid sequence
   having at least 95% identity (e.g., 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identity) to SEQ ID NO: 2, and/or (c) an

40 sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, (e) an amino acid sequence having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 and/or
   combinations thereof. As discussed below, vectors (e.g., viral vectors, such as an adenovirus or poxvirus

    vector) of the invention can include one or more of these nucleic acid molecules. Accordingly, vaccines
    of the invention may include one or more of these vectors. The stabilized gp140 Env trimer polypeptides
    of the invention, as well as vaccines, nucleic acids, and vectors that incorporate one or more optimized
    gp140 Env polypeptides, can be recombinantly expressed in a cell or organism, or can be directly
  5 administered to a subject (e.g., a human) infected with, or at risk of becoming infected with, HIV (e.g.,
    HIV-1).
    Vectors of the Invention
             As noted above, the invention features vectors including one or more of the nucleic acid
  0 molecules of the invention. The vector can be, for example, a carrier (e.g., a liposome), a plasmid, a
    cosmid, a yeast artificial chromosome, or a virus (e.g., an adenovirus vector or a poxvirus vector) that
    includes one or more of the nucleic acid molecules of the invention.
             An adenovirus vector of the invention can be derived from a recombinant adenovirus serotype 11
    (Adl1), adenovirus serotype 15 (Ad15), adenovirus serotype 24 (Ad24), adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26),
 5  adenovirus serotype 34 (Ad34), adenovirus serotype 35 (Ad35), adenovirus serotype 48 (Ad48),
    adenovirus serotype 49 (Ad49), adenovirus serotype 50 (Ad50), Pan9 (AdC68), or a chimeric variant
    thereof (e.g., adenovirus serotype 5 HVR48 (Ad5HVR48)). A poxvirus vector of the invention may be
    derived, for example, from modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA). These vectors can include additional
    nucleic acid sequences from several sources.
 .0          Vectors of the invention can be constructed using any recombinant molecular biology technique
    known in the art. The vector, upon transfection or transduction of a target cell or organism, canbe
    extrachromosomal or integrated into the host cell chromosome. The nuciei acid component of a vector
    can be in single or multiple copy number per target cell, and can be linear, circular, or concatamerized.
    The vectors can also include internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequences to allow for the expression of
 '5 multiple peptide or polypeptide chains from a single nucleic acid transcript (e.g., a polycistronic vector,
    e.g., a bi- or tri-cistronic vector)
             Vectors of the invention can also include gene expression elements that facilitate the expression
    of the encoded polypeptide(s) of the invention (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 1 (mEnv), 2 (mEnv+), 3 (cEnv), 4
    and/or 5 or polypeptides having amino acids sequences with at least 90%, 91%, 92$, 93&, 94%, 95%,
30  96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2). Gene expression elements include,
    but are not limited to, (a) regulatory sequences, such as viral transcription promoters and their enhancer
    elements, such as the SV40 early promoter, Rous sarcoma virus LTR, and Moloney murine leukemia
    virus LTR; (b) splice regions and polyadenylation sites such as those derived from the SV40 late region;
    and (c) polyadenylation sites such as in SV40. Also included are plasmid origins of replication, antibiotic
35  resistance or selection genes, multiple cloning sites (e.g., restriction enzyme cleavage loci), and other
    viral gene sequences (e.g., sequences encoding viral structural, functional, or regulatory elements, such
    as the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR)).
             Exemplary vectors are described below.

              Adenovirus Vectors
              Recombinant adenoviruses offer several significant advantages for use as vectors for the
    expression of, for example, one or more of the optimized gp140 Env polypeptides of the invention. The
    viruses can be prepared to high titer, can infect non-replicating cells, and can confer high-efficiency
  5 transduction of target cells ex vivo following contact with a target cell population. Furthermore,
    adenoviruses do not integrate their DNA into the host genome. Thus, their use as expression vectors has
    a reduced risk of inducing spontaneous proliferative disorders. In animal models, adenoviral vectors have
    generally been found to mediate high-level expression for approximately one week. The duration of
    transgene expression (expression of a nucleic acid molecule of the invention) can be prolonged by using
 10 cell or tissue-specific promoters. Other improvements in the molecular engineering of the adenovirus
    vector itself have produced more sustained transgene expression and less inflammation. This is seen
    with so-called "second generation" vectors harboring specific mutations in additional early adenoviral
    genes and 'gutless" vectors in which
    virtually all the viral genes are deleted utilizing a Cre-Lox strategy (Engelhardt et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
 15 USA 91:6196 (1994) and Kochanek et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:5731 (1996), each herein
    incorporated by reference).
              The rare serotype and chimeric adenoviral vectors disclosed in International Patent Application
    Publications WO 2006/040330 and WO 2007/104792, each incorporated by reference herein, are
    particular useful as vectors of the invention F.or example, recombinant adernovirus serotype           (Ad11),

    adenovirus serotype 49 (Ad49), adenovirus serotype 50 (Ad50), PanO AdC68) or a chimeric variant
    thereof (e.g., adenovirus serotype 5 HVR48 (Ad5HVPA8) can encode and/or deliver one or more of the
    optimized gp140 Env polypeptides of the invention to facilitate formation and presentation of gp140 Env
 )5 trimer formation. in some embodiments, one or more recombinant adenovirus vectors can be
    administered to the subject in order to express gp140 Env polypeptides for formation of stabilized trimers
    of the invention.
              Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) Vectors
30            Adeno-associated viruses (AAV), derived from non-pathogenic parvoviruses, can also be used to
    facilitate delivery and/or expression of one or more of the optimized gp140 Env polypeptides of the
    invention as these vectors evoke almost no anti-vector cellular immune response, and produce transgene
    expression lasting months in most experimental systems.
              Stabilized trimers of the invention may be produced upon expression of the gp140 Env
35  polypeptides described herein using an AAV vector.
              Retrovirus Vectors
              Retroviruses are useful for the expression of optimized gp140 Env polypeptides of the invention.
    Unlike adenoviruses, the retroviral genome is based in RNA. When a retrovirus infects a cell, it will
40  introduce its RNA together with several enzymes into the cell. The viral RNA molecules from the
    retrovirus will produce a double-stranded DNA copy, called a provirus, through a process called reverse
                                                             20

         WO 2014/107744                                                                    PCT/US2014/010543
    transcription. Following transport into the cell nucleus, the proviral DNA is integrated in a host cell
    chromosome, permanently altering the genome of the transduced cell and any progeny cells that may
    derive from this cell. The ability to permanently introduce a gene into a cell or organism is the defining
    characteristic of retroviruses used for gene therapy. Retroviruses include lentiviruses, a family of viruses
  5 including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that includes several accessory proteins to facilitate viral
    infection and proviral integration. Current, "third-generation," lentiviral vectors feature total replication
    incompetence, broad tropism, and increased gene transfer
    capacity for mammalian cells (see, e.g., Mangeat and Trono, Human Gene Therapy 16(8):913 (2005) and
    Wiznerowicz and Trono, Trends Biotechnol 23(1):42 (2005), each herein incorporated by reference).
  0            Stabilized trimers of the invention may be produced upon expression of the gp140 Env
    polypeptides described herein using a retrovirus vector.
               Other Viral Vectors
               Besides adenoviral and retroviral vectors, other viral vectors and techniques are known in the art
 [5 that can be used to facilitate delivery and/or expression of one or more of the optimized gp140 Env
    polypeptides of the invention in a cell (e.g., a blood cell, such as a lymphocyte) or subject (e.g., a human)
    in order to promote formation of the trimers of the invention. These viruses include poxviruses (e.g.,
    vaccinia virus and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA); see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,603,112 and
    5762,938, each incorporated by reference herein), herpesviruses, togaviruses (e.g., Venezuelan Equine

  5            Naked DNA and Oligonucleotides
               Naked DNA or oligonucleotides encoding one or more of the optimized gp140 Env polypeptides
    of the invention can also be used to express these polypeptides in a cell or a subject (e.g., a human) in
    order to promote formation of the trimers of the invention. See, e.g., Cohen, Science 259:1691-1692
    (1993); Fynan et al., Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:11478 (1993); and Wolff et al., BioTechniques
30   11:474485 (1991), each herein incorporated by reference. This is the simplest method of non-viral
    transfection. Efficient methods for delivery of naked DNA exist, such as electroporation and the use of a
    "gene gun," which shoots DNA-coated gold particles into a cell using high pressure gas and carrier
     particles (e.g., gold).

     polypeptides of the invention into a cell or subject in order to promote formation of the trimers of the
     invention, lipoplexes (e.g., liposomes) and polyplexes can be used to protect the nucleic acid from
     undesirable degradation during the transfection process. The nucleic acid molecules can be covered with
40   lipids in an organized structure like a micelle or a liposome. When the organized structure is complexed
    with the nucleic acid molecule it is called a lipoplex. There are three types of lipids: anionic (negatively
                                                             21

        WO 2014/107744                                                                   PCT/US2014/010543
    charged), neutral, or cationic (positively-charged). Lipoplexes that utilize cationic lipids have proven utility
    for gene transfer. Cationic lipids, due to their positive charge, naturally complex with the negatively
    charged nucleic acid. Also as a result of their charge they interact with the cell membrane, endocytosis of
    the lipoplex occurs, and the nucleic acid is released into the cytoplasm. The cationic lipids also protect
  5 against degradation of the nucleic acid by the cell.
             Complexes of polymers with nucleic acids are called polyplexes. Most polyplexes consist of
    cationic polymers and their production is regulated by ionic interactions. One large difference between
    the methods of action of polyplexes and lipoplexes is that polyplexes cannot release their nucleic acid
    load into the cytoplasm, so, to this end, co-transfection with endosome-lytic agents (to lyse the endosome
  0 that is made during endocytosis) such as inactivated adenovirus must occur. However, this is not always
    the case; polymers such as polyethylenimine have their own method of endosome disruption as does
    chitosan and trimethylchitosan.
             Exemplary cationic lipids and polymers that can be used in combination with one or more of the
    nucleic acid molecules encoding one or more of the optimized gp140 Env polypeptides of the invention to
  5 form lipoplexes or polyplexes include, but are not limited to, polyethylenimine, lipofectin, lipofectamine,
    polylysine, chitosan, trimethylchitosan, and alginate.
             Hybrid methods
             Several hybrid methods of gene transfer combine tw o more techniques. Virosomes. fo
  { example, combine lipoplexes (e.g., liposomes) with an inactivated virus. Thi approach has been showr
    to result in more efficient gene transfer in respiratory epithelia cells compared to either viral or liposoma
    methods alone. Other methods involve mixing other viral vectors vith cationi lipids or hybridizing
    viruses. Each of these methods can be used to facilitate transfer of one or more of the nucleic acid
    molecules of the invention encoding one or more of the optimized gp140 Env polypeptides of the
 )5 invention into a cell or subject in order to promote formation of the trimers of the invention.
             Dendrimers
             Dendrimers may be also be used to transfer one or more of the nucleic acid molecules of the
    invention encoding one or more of the optimized gp140 Env polypeptides of the invention into a cell or
30  subject in order to promote formation of the trimers of the invention. A dendrimer is a highly branched
    macromolecule with a spherical shape. The surface of the particle may be functionalized in many ways,
    and many of the properties of the resulting construct are determined by its surface. In particular it is
    possible to construct a cationic dendrimer (i.e., one with a positive surface charge). When in the
    presence of genetic material (e.g., a nucleic acid molecule), charge complimentarity leads to a temporary
35  association of the nucleic acid with the cationic dendrimer. On reaching its destination the dendrimer
    nucleic acid complex is then taken into the cell via endocytosis.
    Methods of Treatment using the Compositions of the Invention
             In vivo Administration
40           The invention features methods for the in vivo administration of a therapeutically effective amount
    of one or more of the compositions (i.e., vaccines, vectors, stabilized trimer(s), nucleic acids,

    polypeptides, stabilized trimer, or other composition thereof described herein) of the invention to a subject
    (e.g., a human, e.g., a human infected with HIV or a human at risk of an HIV infection) in need thereof.
    Upon administering one or more of the compositions of the invention to the subject, the stabilized trimers
    of the invention can elicit protective or therapeutic immune responses (e.g., cellular or humoral immune
  5 responses, e.g., neutralizing anti-HIV antisera production, e.g., anti-HIV antisera that neutralizes HIV
    selected from clade A, clade B, and/or clade C HIV) directed against the viral immunogens.
             The method may be used to treat or reduce the risk of an HIV infection in a subject in need
    thereof. The subject may be infected with HIV or may be at risk of exposure to HIV. The compositions of
    the invention can be administered to a subject infected with HIV to treat AIDS. Examples of symptoms of
  0 diseases caused by a viral infection, such as AIDS, that can be treated using the compositions of the
    invention include, for example, fever, muscle aches, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, sore throat,
    headache, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, weakness, dizziness, bleeding under the skin, in internal
    organs, or from body orifices like the mouth, eyes, or ears, shock, nervous system malfunction, delirium,

  5 paralysis of the limbs, confusion, back pain, loss of sensation, impaired bladder and bowel function, and
    sleepiness that can progress into coma or death. These symptoms, and their resolution during treatment,
    may be measured by, for example, a physician during a physical examination or by other tests and
    methods known in the art.

 .5 of a control subject (e.g., an untreated subject or a subject treated with a placebo).
             One or more of the compositions of the invention may also be administered in the form of a
    vaccine for prophylactic treatment of a subject (e.g., a human) at risk of an HIV infection.
             The compositions utilized in the methods described herein can be formulated, for example, for
    administration intramuscularly, intravenously, intradermally, percutaneously, intraarterially,
30  intraperitoneally, intralesionally, intracranially, intraarticularly, intraprostatically, intrapleurally,

    localized perfusion bathing target cells directly, by catheter, by lavage, by gavage, in cremes, or in lipid
35  compositions.
             The preferred method of administration can vary depending on various factors (e.g., the
    components of the composition being administered and the severity of the condition being treated).
    Formulations suitable for oral or nasal administration may consist of liquid solutions, such as an effective
    amount of the composition dissolved in a diluent (e.g., water, saline, or PEG-400), capsules, sachets,
40  tablets, or gels, each containing a predetermined amount of the chimeric Ad5 vector composition of the
    invention. The pharmaceutical composition may also be an aerosol formulation for inhalation, for
                                                               23

   example, to the bronchial passageways. Aerosol formulations may be mixed with pressurized,
   pharmaceutically acceptable propellants (e g., dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, or nitrogen). In
   particular, administration by inhalation can be accomplished by using, for example, an aerosol containing
   sorbitan trioleate or oleic acid, for example, together with trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorofluoromethane,
 5 dichlorotetrafluoroethane, or any other biologically compatible propellant gas.
             Immunogenicity of the composition of the invention may be significantly improved if it is co
   administered with an immunostimulatory agent or adjuvant. Suitable adjuvants well-known to those
   skilled in the art include, for example, aluminum phosphate, aluminum hydroxide, QS21, Quil A (and
   derivatives and components thereof), calcium phosphate, calcium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide, glycolipid
10 analogs, octodecyl esters of an amino acid, muramyl dipeptides, polyphosphazene, lipoproteins, ISCOM
   matrix, DOC-Chol, DDA, cytokines, Adju-Phos, Matrix M, CpG/Emulsigen, and other adjuvants and
   derivatives thereof.
             Compositions according to the invention described herein may be formulated to release the
   composition immediately upon administration (e.g., targeted delivery) or at any predetermined time period
15 after administration using controlled or extended release formulations. Administration of the composition
   in controlled or extended release formulations is useful where the composition, either alone or in
   combination, has (i) a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., the difference between the plasma concentration
   leading to harmful side effects or toxic reactions and the plasma concentration leading to a therapeutic
   effect is small generally the therapeutic index Ti         defined as the ratio of medianletha dose(D      50) to
?0 median effective dose (ED5 )); (ii) a narrow absorption window at the site of release (eg., the gastro
   intestinaltract);or (iii) a shot biologica hal-ife so tha frequent dosingduring a day i required in order
   to sustain a therapeutic leve
             Many strategies car be pursued to obtain controlled or extended release in which the rate of
   release outweighs the rate of metabolism of the pharmaceutical composition. For example, controlled
25 release can be obtained by the appropriate selection of formulation parameters and ingredients,
   including, for example, appropriate controlled release compositions and coatings. Suitable formulations
   are known to those of skill in the art. Examples include single or multiple unit tablet or capsule
   compositions, oil solutions, suspensions, emulsions, microcapsules, microspheres, nanoparticles,
   patches, and liposomes.

40 weeks, 1-12 months, 1-20 years) or may be for the life of the subject. The composition(s) may also be
   administered to said subject as a prime or a boost composition or in a prime-boost regimen. In a

             When treating disease(e.g., ADS), the compositions of the invention may be administered to te
   subject either before the occurrence of symptoms or a definitive diagnosis or after diagnosis or symptoms
   become evident. For example, the composition may be administered, for example, immediately after
 5 diagnosis or the clinical recognition of symptoms or 2, 4, 6, 10, 15, or 24 hours, 2, 3, 5, or 7 days, 2, 4, 6
   or 8 weeks, or even 3, 4, or 6 months after diagnosis or detection of symptoms.
             For in vivo treatment of human and non-human patients infected with HIV, the patient may be
   administered or provided a pharmaceutical formulation including a composition of the present invention.
   When used for in vivo therapy, compositions of the invention may be administered to the patient in
30 therapeutically effective amounts (i.e., amounts that eliminate or reduce the patient's viral burden). The
   compositions may be administered to a human patient in accord with known methods, such as
   intravenous administration, e.g., as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by
   intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerobrospinal, subcutaneous, intraarticular, intrasynovial, intrathecal,
   oral, topical, or inhalation routes. The compositions may be administered parenterally, when possible, at
35 the target cell site, or intravenously. Intravenous or subcutaneous administration of the composition is
   preferred in certain embodiments. Therapeutic compositions of the invention may be administered to a
   patient or subject systemically, parenterally, or locally.
             The compositions may be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile
   filtered. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized

    compositions in solid form may be packaged in multiple single dose units, each containing a fixed amount
    of any one or more of the optimized gp140 Env nucleic acids required to support formation of one or more
    of the stabilized trimers of the invention and/or one or more of the stabilized trimers of the invention of the
  5 invention and, if desired, one or more immunomodulatory agents, such as in a sealed package of tablets
    or capsules, or in a suitable dry powder inhaler (DPI) capable of administering one or more doses.
             Dosages
             The dose of a composition of the invention (e.g., a vaccine including one or more of the stabilized
 10 gp140 Env trimers of the invention) or the number of treatments using a composition of the invention may
    be increased or decreased based on the severity of, occurrence of, or progression of, the HIV infection
    and/or disease related to the HIV infection (e.g., AIDS) in the subject (e.g., based on the severity of one
    or more symptoms of HIV infection/AIDS described above).
             The stabilized gpl40 Env trimer compositions of the invention can be administered in a
  5 therapeutically effective amount that provides an immunogenic and/or protective effect against HIV or
    target protein of HIV (e g., gp140). The subject may, for example, be administered polypeptide
    compositions of the invention (e.g., stabilized gp140 Env trimers of the invention) in a non-vectored
    composition. The polypeptide composition administered may include between approximately 1 pg and 1
    mg of stabilized Env trimers, and more preferably between 50 pg and 300 pg of stabilized Env trimers of
 J0 the invention.
               Alternatively, the subject may be administereein the forrn ofairal vector, at least about 1x403
    viral particles (vp)/dose or between 1"xia and1IO        vp/dose preferably between 1x10 and
    vp/doseand more preferably between 1x10 and             10vp/dose.
              Viral particles include nucleic acid molecules encoding one or more of the optimized gp140 Env
  5 polypeptides of the invention and are surrounded by a protective coat (a protein-based capsid with hexon
    and fiber proteins). Viral particle number can be measured based on, for example, lysis of vector
    particles, followed by measurement of the absorbance at 260 nm (see, e.g,. Steel, Curr. Opin. Biotech.,
    1999).
             The dosage administered depends on the subject to be treated (e.g., the age, body weight,
30  capacity of the immune system, and general health of the subject being treated), the form of
    administration (e.g., as a solid or liquid), the manner of administration (e.g., by injection, inhalation, dry
    powder propellant), and the cells targeted (e.g., epithelial cells, such as blood vessel epithelial cells, nasal
    epithelial cells, or pulmonary epithelial cells). The composition is preferably administered in an amount
    that provides a sufficient level of the stabilized gp140 Env trimer gene product (e.g., a level of stabilized
35  gp140 Env trimer that elicits an immune response without undue adverse physiological effects in the
    subject caused by the immunogenic trimer).
             In addition, single or multiple administrations of the compositions of the present invention may be
    given (pre- or post-infection and/or pre- or post-diagnosis) to a subject (e.g., one administration or
    administration two or more times). For example, subjects who are particularly susceptible to, for
40  example, HIV infection may require multiple treatments to establish and/or maintain protection against the
    virus. Levels of induced immunity provided by the pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be
                                                           26

    monitored by, for example, measuring amounts of neutralizing anti-HIV secretory and serum antibodies.
    The dosages may then be adjusted or repeated as necessary to trigger the desired level of immune
    response. For example, the immune response triggered by a single administration (prime) of a
    composition of the invention may not be sufficiently potent and/or persistent to provide effective
  5 protection. Accordingly, in some embodiments, repeated administration (boost), such that a prime-boost
    regimen is established, may significantly enhance humoral and cellular responses to the antigen of the
    composition.
             Alternatively, as applies to recombinant therapy, the efficacy of treatment can be determined by
    monitoring the level of the one or more optimized gp140 Env trimers expressed by or present in a subject
 10 (e.g., a human) following administration of the compositions of the invention. For example, the blood or
    lymph of a subject can be tested for the immunogenic trimer(s) using, for example, standard assays
    known in the art (see, e.g., Human Interferon-Alpha Multi-Species ELISA kit (Product No. 41105) and the
    Human Interferon-Alpha Serum Sample kit (Product No. 41110) from Pestka Biomedical Laboratories
    (PBL), Piscataway, New Jersey).
 15          A single dose of one or more of the compositions of the invention may achieve protection, pre
    infection or pre-diagnosis. In addition, a single dose administered post-infection or post-diagnosis can
    function as a treatment according to the present invention.
             A single dose of one or more of the compositions of the invention can also be used to achieve
    therapy in subjects being treated for a disease. Multiple doses (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, or more doses) can also
 )0 be administered, in necessary, to these subjects.

             Adiuvants
             Any one of the compositions of the invention (e.g., vaccines, vectors, stabilized trimer(s), nucleic
    acid molecules, etc.) can be formulated to include, be administered concurrently with, and/or be
    administered in series with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants to increase the
    immunogenicity of the composition (e.g. upon administration to a subject in need thereof, e.g., a subject
    infected with HIV or at risk of an HIV infection). Adjuvants approved for human use include aluminum
  0 salts (alum). These adjuvants have been useful for some vaccines including hepatitis B, diphtheria, polio,
    rabies, and influenza. Other useful adjuvants include Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA), Incomplete
    Freund's Adjuvant (IFA), muramyl dipeptide (MDP), synthetic analogues of MDP, N-acetylmuramyl-L
    alanyl-D-isoglutamyl-L-alanine-2-[1,2-dipalmitoyl-s-gly- cero-3-(hydroxyphosphoryloxy)]ethylamide (MTP
    PE), Adju-Phos, Matrix M, CpG/Emulsigen, and compositions containing a metabolizable oil and an
  5 emulsifying agent, wherein the oil and emulsifying agent are present in the form of an oil-in-water
    emulsion having oil droplets substantially all of which are less than one micron in diameter.
             Ex Vivo Transfection and Transduction
               he present invention also provides for the ex vivo transfection or transduction of cells followed
 .0 by administration of these cells back into a subject (e g., human) to allow for the expression of one or
    more of the optimized gp i40 Env polypeptides of the invention that have immunogenic properties. Ir one
    embodiment, the cells areutologous toLthe treated subjec.Cellscan beansfected or ransduced -x
    vivo with, for example one or more vectors of the invention to allow fr the temporal or permanent
    expression of one or more of the optimized gp140 Env polypeptides in the treated subject. Upon
 ;5 administering these modified cells to the subject, the one or more vectors of the invention will be
    expressed, eliciting protective or therapeutic immune responses (e.g., cellular or humoral immune
    responses, e.g., production of neutralizing anti-HIV antisera) directed against the gp140 immunogenic
    trimer or trimers that form.
             Cells that can be isolated and transfected or transduced ex vivo according to the methods of
30  invention include, but are not limited to, blood cells, skin cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, skeletal
    muscle cells, hepatocytes, prostate epithelial cells, and vascular endothelial cells. Stem cells are also
    appropriate cells for transduction or transfection with a vector of the invention. Totipotent, pluripotent,
    multipotent, or unipotent stem cells, including bone marrow progenitor cells and hematopoietic stem cells
    (HSC), can be isolated and transfected or transduced with, for example, a vector of the invention, and
35  administered to a subject according to the methods of the invention.
             The method of transfection or transduction has a strong influence on the strength and longevity of
    protein expression (e.g., stabilized gp140 trimer expression) in the transfected or transduced cell, and
    subsequently, in the subject (e.g., human) receiving the cell. The present invention provides vectors that
    are temporal (e.g., adenoviral vectors) or long-lived (e.g., retroviral vectors) in nature. Regulatory
40  sequences (e.g., promoters and enhancers) are known in the art that can be used to regulate protein
    expression. The type of cell being transfected or transduced also has a strong bearing on the strength
                                                            28

    and longevity of protein expression. For example, cell types with high rates of turnover can be expected
   to have shorter periods of protein expression.
             Combination Therapies
 5           Other therapeutic regimens can be combined with the administration of compositions of the
    present invention. The combined administration includes co-administration, using separate formulations
   or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably
   there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.
    Preferably such combined therapy results in a synergistic therapeutic effect. In certain embodiments, it is
 0 desirable to combine administration of a composition of the invention with an agent (e.g., an antibody or
   antibody fragment) directed against an antigen associated with the infectious agent. Passive
    immunization has proven to be an effective and safe strategy for the prevention and treatment of viral
   diseases (see Keller et al., Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 13:602- 14 (2000); Casadevall, Nat. Biotechnol. 20: 114
    (2002); Shibata et al., Nat. Med. 5:204-10 (1999); and Igarashi et al., Nat. Med. 5:211-16 (1999), each of
 5 which are incorporated herein by reference). Passive immunization using human monoclonal antibodies,
    provide an immediate treatment strategy for emergency prophylaxis and treatment of HIV, and can be
    used in combination alongside the compositions of the present invention. HIV antibodies and fragments
   thereof specifically bind or preferentially bind to infected cells, as compared to normal control uninfected
   cells an tissue. Thus, these HIV antibodies can be used to selectively target infected celis or tissue in a
 O patien, biological sample, or cell population, e.g., a part of      combination therapy with compositions of
   the present invention.
             For example, US Provisionai Application No. 61/886,932, incorporated herein by reference in its
   entirety, discloses HIV clade C Env trimers, the polypeptides of which may be used in combination with
   polypeptides disclosed herein to form trimers of the present invention. US Provisional Application No.
 5 61/884,414, also incorporated herein by reference, discloses methods of treating subjects infected with
    HIV and blocking HIV infections in subjects at risk of HIV infection using H332 glycan-dependent
   antibodies. PCT application WO 2012/030904, also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety,
   discloses broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV, any of which can be used in methods of treating HIV
   in a subject in need thereof according to the present invention. Exemplary antibodies include VRC01,
30  PGT121, PGT126, PG9, PG16, and 3BNC117.

             The invention provides kits that include a pharmaceutical composition containing a vaccine,
35 vector, stabilized trimer, or optimized viral polypeptide of the invention, and a pharmaceutically
   acceptable carrier, in a therapeutically effective amount for preventing or treating a viral infection. The
   kits include instructions to allow a clinician (e.g., a physician or nurse) to administer the composition
   contained therein.
             Preferably, the kits include multiple packages of the single-dose pharmaceutical composition(s)
40 containing an effective amount of a vaccine, vector, stabilized trimer, or optimized viral polypeptide of the
   invention. Optionally, instruments or devices necessary for administering the pharmaceutical

     composition(s) may be included in the kits. For instance, a kit of this invention may provide one or more
     pre-filled syringes containing an effective amount of a vaccine, vector, stabilized trimer, or optimized viral
     polypeptide of the invention. Furthermore, the kits may also include additional components such as
     instructions or administration schedules for a patient infected with or at risk of being infected with a virus
  5  to use the pharmaceutical composition(s) containing a vaccine, vector, stabilized trimer, or optimized viral
     polypeptide of the invention.
               It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made
     in the compositions, methods, and kits of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope
     of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of

    Roller Bottle Transfection and Protein Purification
              DMEM growth media supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) was used to grow 293T
    to confluence in Cell Bind* roller bottles (Corning), growth media removed, followed by addition of 250 ml
    of pre-warmed Freestyle 293 expression medium (Invitrogen) and incubation for 2 hours at 370C, 5%
  5 C02. 250 pg of DNA expression vector pVRC8400 mosaic gp140 version-2 was mixed with 320 pl of
    polyethylenimine (PEI) (1 mg/ml) added to 20 ml of room temperature freestyle 293 medium, incubated at
    room temperature for 20 minutes and then added in each roller bottle followed by incubation for 6 days in
    370C, 5% C02. The cell supernatant was harvested at 6 days after medium change. The Histidine
    tagged optimized mosaic gp140 Env version-2 protein, including SEQ ID NO: 2, was purified by Ni-NTA
  0 (Qiagen) followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Briefly, after a clarifying spin and the addition of
    imidazole to the final concentration of 10 mM, the cell supernatant was loaded onto a nickel column at a
    flow rate of 0.8 mL/min and was washed with 20 mM imidazole in PBS followed by further washing with
    40 mM imidazole in PBS. The protein then was eluted with 300 mM imidazole in PBS. The fractions
    containing the purified protein were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by gel-filtration
  5 chromatography on Superose 6 (GE Healthcare) in a column running buffer containing 25 mM Tris (pH
    7.5) and 150 mM NaCl. The purified proteins were concentrated, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at
    80 1C.

    Neutralizing Antibody Assay in TZM. bl Cells
              Neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 Env pseudoviruses were measured using
    luciferase-based virus neutralization assays in TZM.bl cells. These assays measure the reduction in
35  luciferase reporter gene expression in TZM-bl cells following a single round of virus infection. The ID50
    was calculated as the serum dilution that resulted in a 50% reduction in relative luminescence units
    compared with the virus control wells after the subtraction of cell control relative luminescence units.
    Briefly, threefold serial dilutions of serum samples were performed in duplicate (96-well flat-bottomed

    Example 2. Generation of optimized mosaic gpl40 Env1 trimers of the invention
               mEnv+ (polypeptide including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2) has been modified
    from mEnv (polypeptide including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1) in the following manner.
    First, the leader peptide secretion sequence has been made identical to that used in the stabilized clade
 [0 C gp140 Env (cEnv) trimer polypeptide constituent (SEQ ID NO: 3). Second, cleavage site mutations
    have been incorporated between gpl 20 and gp4l moieties to further enhance stability. Third, a factor Xa
    protease cleavage site (SRIEGR) has been incorporated upstream of the foldon trimerization domain.
    The amino acid sequences of the three Env polypeptides (SEQ ID NOs: 1-3) and the specific
    modifications present in each are depicted in Figures 1A-1C.
  5           Surprisingly, these modifications resulted in a remarkably stabilized gp140 Env1 trimer (e.g., an
    mEnv+ trimer of the invention). In order to assess stability, we first compared the expression levels of
    mEnv+ relative to mEnv by Western blot analysis. To this end, T-25 flasks containing 80% confluent
    293T cells were transfected with eukaryoti expression vector pVRC8400 expressing mEnv or mEnv+
    using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) andilof each supernatantaalyzed by Western bloa
                                               tag RP (Qiagen). Figure 2 depict a Western blot showing the

    expressior.levels of mEnv and mEnv+ irdanes            and respectively       Notably the expression levels of
    mEnv-r were remarkabIy higher compared to th           of mEnv or cEnv, which was used as a positive control
    (see lane 1).     In this experiment, empty pVRC8400 was used as a negative control (see lane 2).
              As noted above, the mEnv+ was expressed in 293T cells and purified following cell lysis and
 .5 clarification by virtue of a His-tag using a Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column. The collected fractions following
    imidazole elution were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by gel-filtration chromatography on
    Superose 6 (GE Healthcare) in a column running buffer containing 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and 150 mM
    NaCl. A chromatography trace of depicting mEnv+ elution from the Superose 6 column is depicted in
    Figure 3. The peak fractions (i.e., the fractions obtained under the peak curve in Figure 3) were then
30  individually analyzed on a 4-15% pre-case SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 4). The SDS-PAGE gel demonstrates
    that the gel-filtration purification succesfully resulted in the isolation of a homogenous population of
    mEnv+ polypeptides. As described further herein, the immunogenicity of these stabilized gp140 Env
    trimers (both homotrimers of mEnv and mEnv+, as well as a combination of mEnv and cEnv homotrimers)
    was assessed in guinea pigs using a panel of tier 1 isolates from clades A, B, and C.

    Example 3. Analysis of neutralizing antibody responses
               Preclinical evaluation of candidate Env immunogens is critical for concept testing and for
    prioritization of vaccine candidates. Luciferase-based virus neutralization assays in TZM.bl cells (Li et al.

40  developed as high throughput assay that can be standardized (Montefiori (2009) Methods Mol. Biol.
    485:395; Polonis et al. (2008) Virology 375:315). A luciferase reporter gene assay was performed in
                                                             32

     TZM-b1 cells (a genetically engineered cell line that expresses CD4, CXCR4 and CCR5 and contains
     Tat-inducible Luc and @-Gal reporter reporter genes) based on single round infection with molecularly
     cloned Env-pseudotyped viruses. This assay resulted in a high success rate in single round infections,
     increased assay capacity (e.g., a two day assay), increased precision (e.g., accurately measured 50%
  5  neutralization), and an improved level of standardization (e.g., a stable cell line). The luciferase reporter
     gene assay was optimized and validated.
              To assess the neutralization profile afforded by the stabilized gp140 Env trimers of the invention,
     TZM.b1 assays were performed in which guinea pig sera obtained pre-vaccination (Pre) and four weeks
     after the third vaccination (Post) with cEnv homotrimers, mEnv homotrimers, or both cEnv and mEnv
  0  homotrimers were tested against a multi-clade panel of tier 1 neutralization-sensitive isolates including
     clade B (SF162.LS and Bal.26), and clade C (MW965.26 and TV1 .21) HIV-1 Envelope pseudoviruses
     and Murine lukemia virus (MuLV) (negative control) (Figures 5A-5C).
              TZM.b1 assays were also performed in which guinea pig sera obtained pre-vaccination (Pre) and
     four weeks after the third vaccination (Post) using cEnv homotrimers, mEnv homotrimers, or both cEnv
  5  and mEnv homotrimers were tested against HIV-1 Envelope pseudoviruses of intermediate neutralization
     sensitive tier-1 (Tier 1B) cliadeA isolates (MS208.A1 and Q23.17) (Figures 6A-6B), highly neutralization
     sensitive (Tier IA) and Tier 1B clade B isolates (SF162.LS, BaL.26, SS1196.1, and 6535.3) (Figures 7A
     7D), and Tier lA and Tier 1B clade C isolates (MW965.26, TV1.21, ZM109F.PB4, and ZM 9MPB7)

     Example 4. Treating or reducing the risk of an HIV infection in a subject using the compositions
     of the invention
              The composition of the invention (e.g., a vaccine of the invention) may be administered to a
     subject (e.g., a human infected with HIV or at risk of an HIV infection) in a prime-boost vaccination
30   regimen to treat or reduce the risk of an HIV infection in a subject in need thereof. For example, one or

    Example 5. Combination of mEnv trimer with cEnv trimer elicits superior neutralizing antibody
    responses relative to either trimer alone
    Introduction
 15           The generation of HIV-1 Env glycoprotein immunogens that can elicit both binding and nAbs
    against diverse, circulating HIV-1 strains is a major goal of HIV-1 vaccine development (Stephenson et al.
    (2013) Immunol. Rev. 254:295; Srivastava et al. (2005) Hum. Vaccin. 1:45; Barouch (2008) Nature.
    45:63 Ka rlss-on H edesta m et al1.(2008)1    1\at. Rev. M icrobiol. 6:14; asco, e a9.(21An. Rev.

    interaction and i present as a trimeric spike (gp120/gI .)on the vira surface During the course a
    natural HiV     infection, most individuals induce an-Env antibody responsewith limited neutralzation
    capacity and variability in tne Env gene can be as higl as 30% (Louwagie          a   1995     irol 69:26
    Kalish et al. 1995) Aids. 9:851; Korber et al. (2001) Br. Med. Bull. 58:19), posing major challenges in the
 )5 development of globally relevant Env-based immunogens. it has been reported, however, that
    approximately 10-25% of HIV-1 infected individuals have the ability to produce broadly neutralizing
    antibodies (bnAbs) (Stamatatos et alt (2009) Nat. Med. 15:866) providing the rationale that similar
    responses may be achievable with appropriate Env immunogens. Recent studies have highlighted the
    therapeutic efficacy such bnAbs have in rhesus monkeys chronically infected with the pathogenic simian
30  human immunodeficiency virus SHIV-SF162P3 Barouch et al. (2013) Nature. 503:224).
              One strategy to address HIV-1 sequence diversity has utilized bioinformatically optimized
     mosaic' proteins (Fischer et al. (2007) Nat. Med. 13:100), which are in silicon recombined HIV-1
    sequences designed for improved coverage of global HIV-1 diversity. Several proof-of-concept
    immunogenicity studies in non-human primates have demonstrated that vector-encoded mosaic antigens
35  can augment the depth and breadth of cellular immune responses and also improve antibody responses
    when compared to consensus and/or natural sequence antigens (Stephenson et al. (2012) J. Virol.
    86:11434; Barouch et al. (2010) Nat. Med. 16:319; Santra et al. (2010) Nat. Med. 16:324; Santra et al.
    (2012) Virology. 428:121). We have also recently reported the protective efficacy of vector-based HIV-1
    mosaic antigens against SHIV challenges in rhesus monkeys (Barouch et al. (2013) Cell. 155:531).
40  However, the generation and evaluation of HIV-1 mosaic Env protein immunogens have not previously
    been described.

              In this study, we report the production and characterization of a mosaic M gp140 trimer (mEnv).
    By surface plasmon resonance, mEnv bound CD4 as well as several bnAbs including VRC01, PGT121,
    PGT126, PG9, PG16, and 3BNC117, demonstrating that the trimer was intact and presented these
    relevant epitopes. mEnv also exhibited functional capacity to infect target cells in the TZM.bI assay.
  5 Immunogenicity studies in guinea pig showed that mEnv elicited high binding antibody titers, cross-clade
    tier 1 TZM.bl nAbs and detectable tier 2 A3R5 nAbs that were a different spectrum than those elicited by
    our clade C gp140 trimer (cEnv). The nAb response elicited by a mixture of mEnv and cEnv proved
    additive and was superior to either trimer alone.
 10 Methods
    Production & expression of H/V-1 Env proteins
              Three synthetic gp140 mosaic M Env gene sequences designated mEnv, mEnv2 (Barouch et al
    (2010) Nat. Med. 16:319) and mEnv3, all containing point mutations to eliminate cleavage and fusion
    activity, were derived from a previously described Computational optimization method (Fischer et al.
 15 (2007) Nat. Med. 13:100; Barouch et al. (2010) Nat. Med. 16319). Human codon optimized versions
    were synthesized by GeneArt (Life Technologies). Each construct was engineered to express a C
    terminal T4 bacteriophage fibritin 'foid-on' trimerization domain and polyhistidine motif by PCR
    amplification with custom primers. Genes were cloned into the Sali-BamHl restriction sites of a pCMV

    harvested at 96-108 hours after medium change and the His-tagged gpl40 proteins purified by Ni-NTA
    (Qiagen) and size-exclusion chromatography as previously described (Kovacs et al. (2012) Proc. Nati.
    Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 109:12111; Nkolola et al. (2010) J. Virol. 84:3270). The synthetic gene for full-length
    mosaic M gp120 with a C-terminal His-tag was generated from the mEnv construct by PCR amplification
30  with custom primers, produced in 293T cells utilizing transient transfections with polyethylenimine and
    subsequently purified by Ni-NTA (Qiagen) and size-exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 (GE
    Healthcare). The synthetic gene for full-length mosaic M gp160 used in the TZM.bl assay was
    synthesized by GeneArt (Life Technologies) and cloned into a pcDNA TM3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector
    (Invitrogen).

    Western blot immunodetection
              Supernatants (20 p!) obtained 48-hours post transient transfection of 293T cells with pCMV
    mEnv, mEnv2, or mEnv3 gp140 expression constructs were separately mixed with reducing sample
    buffer (Pierce), heated for 5 minutes at 1000 C and run on a precast 4-15% SDS-PAGE gel (Biorad).
40  Protein was transferred to a PVDF membrane using the iBlot dry blotting system (Invitrogen) and
    membrane blocking performed overnight at 4'C in PBS-T [Dulbeco's Phosphate Buffered Saline + 0.2%

    V/V Tween 20 (Sigma) + 5% WN non-fat milk powder]. Following overnight blocking, the PVDF
    membrane was incubated for 1 hour with PBS T containing a 1:2000 dilution of monoclonal antibody
    penta His-HRP (Qiagen), washed 5 times with PBS-T and developed using the Amersham ECL plus
    Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare). For western blot immunodetection using 2F5 and
 5  4E10 monoclonal antibodies, clade A (92UG037.8) gp140 (Kovacs et al. (2012) Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci.

    as above.
    Surface plasmon resonance
 0            Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was conducted on a Biacore 3000 (GE Healthcare) at 250C
    utilizing HBS-EP running buffer (GE Healthcare). Immobilization of soluble two-domain CD4 (Freeman et
    al. (2010) Structure. 18:1632) (1,500 RU) or protein A (ThermoScientific) to CM5 chips was performed
    following the manufacturer (GE Healthcare) recommendations. Immobilized IgGs were captured at 300
    750 RU. Binding experiments were conducted at a flow rate of 50pl/min with a 2-minute association
 5  phase and 5-minute dissociation phase. Regeneration was conducted with a single injection of 35 mM
    NaOH and 1.3 M NaCI at lO0pl/min followed by a 3-minute equilibration phase in HBS-EP buffer.

 5 Results
   Expression and stability of the mosaic M gp140 trimer
            Eukaryotic pCMV DNA vectors expressing HIV-1 mEnv, mEnv2, and mEnv3 were transfected
   into 293T cells, and protein expression and stability were assessed after 48 hours. Western blot analysis
   revealed a band size of the appropriate size for mEnv gp140 but not for mEnv2 or mEnv3 (Figure 9A),
10 suggesting that the mEnv was a more stable and intact protein than the others. Size exclusion
   chromatography (SEC) using material generated from a stable 293T cell line expressing mEnv
   demonstrated a mono-disperse peak corresponding to the expected size for a gp140 trimer and
   confirmed the homogeneity of the trimer (Figure 9B). To evaluate the stability of this trimer, 100 pg protein
   underwent a freeze-thaw cycle or was stored for 7 days at 4"C and re-evaluated by SEC and showed no
15 signs of aggregation, dissociation or degradation (Figure 9C).

            We next assessed the ability of the CD4bs bnAbs VRC01 and 3BNC1 17 (Wu et al. (2010)
   Science. 329:856; Scheid et al. (2011) Science. 333:1633) to bind to mEnv. VRC01 and 3BNC117 bound
   the mEnv trimer with high affinities of 1.28 nM and 2.12 nM, respectively, showing that these epitopes are
   present in the mEnv trimer (Table 2; Figure 1OC - 10D).

                Recent studies have highlighted the prominent role of N-linked glycans in the recognition of
     epitopes targeted by several bnAbs (Pejchal et al. (2011) Science. 334:1097; Walker et aL (2011) Nature,
     477:466). In particular, the PGT class of bnAbs interact with N-linked glycans (such N332) and variable
     loop 3 (V3). Both PGT121 and PGT126 bound the trimer with high affinities of 28.2 nM and 539 nM
  5  (Table 2; Figure I1A - IIB), respectively y, indicating that the key N-linked glycan epitopes recognized by
     these bnAbs were present on the trimer.
                 PG9 and PG16 bind preferentially to intact Env trimers and target N-linked glycans and variable
     loops 1 and 2 (V1N2) and N-linked glycans in this region (Walker et al. (2009) Science. 326;285;
     McLellan et al. (2011) Nature. 480:336). The mEnv trimer bound to PG9 with a remarkably high affinity
 10  (57.8 nM; Figure 11C), whereas the mosaic gp120 monomer bound with a 22-fold lower affinity and
     substantially lower magnitude (1,280 nM) (Table 2; Figure 11E). The observed binding for PG9 was
     comparable to that observed with the recently described soluble, fully glycosylated cleaved BG505
     SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer (Julien et al. (2013) Science. 342:1477; Sanders et al. (2013) PLoS Pathog.
     9:el 003618). PG16 binding was also substantially greater to the mEnv trimer than the corresponding
 15  gp120 monomer (Table 3; Figures 11D, 11 F), although the off-rate was faster for PG16 compared with
     PG9. These data show that the mEnv timer, but not the corresponding monomer, efficiently binds these
     conformation-dependent bnAbs.

                 Finally, we assessed 2F5 and 4E10 binding to the membrane proximal external region (MPER)
     epitopes. 2F5 and 4E10 bnAbs bind to linear epitopes (Cardoso et al. (2007) J. Mol. Biol. 365:1533; Ofek
     et al. (2004) J. Virol. 78:10724) and at least the 2F5 epitope was present in the linear mEnv sequence as
25   confirmed by sequence alignment (Figure 12A) and Western blot analyses (Figure 12B). However, by
     SPR and ELISA, the intact mEnv trimer was unable to bind 2F5, suggesting that the MPER epitope is
     buried in the trimer (Ofek et al. (2004) J. Virol. 78:10724) and not accessible in the context of the stable,
     folded mEnv trimer (Figure 12C - 12D), similar to our findings with our previously characterized stable
     clade C trimer (Kovacs et al. (2012) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 109:12111). Taken together, these
30   antigenicity data suggest that the mEnv trimer exhibits many features of a properly folded trimer.
     Functionality of the mEnv trimer
                 We next evaluated whether the mEnv protein was functional. Full-length mosaic M gp160 was
     used to generate pseudovirions to assess infectivity in TZM.bl cells (Kovacs et al. (2012) Proc. Nati.
35   Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 109:12111; Nkolola et al. (2010) J. Virol. 84:3270; Mascola et al. (2005) J. Virol.
     79:10103; Montefiori (2009) Methods. Mol. Biol. 485:395). We observed that, over a broad titration range,
                                                              39

         WO 2014/107744                                                                  PCT/US2014/010543
     mEnv readily infected TZM.bl target cells over-expressing CD4 and co-receptors CCR5/CXCR4 (Figure
     13). These data indicated that the synthetic mEnv has the functional ability to infect TZM.bl target cells.
    Immunogenicity of the mEnv trimer
  5           Guinea pigs (n=5/group) were immunized three times at monthly intervals with 100 pg mEnv
    trimer, 100 pg of our previously reported clade C gp140 trimer (hereafter referred to as "cEnv' Kovacs et
    al. (2012) Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 109:12111; Nkolola et al. (2010) J. Virol. 84:3270) or a mixture of
    50 pg of both trimers with ISCOM-based Matrix M or Emulsigen/CpG adjuvants (Kovacs et al. (2012)
    Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 109:12111; loannou et al. (2002) J. Virol. 76:9002). High titer, binding
 10 antibodies by ELISA were elicited by all the vaccination regimens with comparable kinetics (Figure 14A
     14B). These responses were detectable after a single immunization and increased after the second and
    third immunization. Peak immunogenicity titers ranged from 5.0-7.0 logs. Binding antibody titers elicited
    by cEnv and mEnv trimers were higher against their respective homologous antigens (P<0.05), whereas
    the bivalent mEnv and cEnv mixture induced comparable responses to both antigens (Figure 14A - 14B).
  5           We next assessed nAb responses elicited in these animals pre-vaccination and post-3d
    vaccination serum samples using the TZM.bl nAb assay (Kovacs et al. (2012) Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci.
    U.S.A. 109:12111; Nkolola et al. (2010) J. Virol. 84:3270; Mascola et al. (2005) J. Virol. 79:10103;
    Montefiori (2009) Methods. Mol. Biol. 48:395). We included a multi-lade panel of tier 1 psuedoviruses
    comprising easy-toneutralize tier 1A viruses(SPF62LS MW96526and an extended pane of
  S interrmediate tierBvirusesDJ26~3, Ba!26,V.2, MS208, Q237 SSI961 65355CZM09
    ZM19        Background ore-vaccination titerswere observed a negative to low (<20) rrEn administered
     in Matrix M adjuvant wasobserveddo induce highilter ZMib nAb against tier 1           SF62,      M96,26)
    and several terlB (D263.8 BaE26, SS196.)viruses (Figure SA               158).When comparedto cEnv
    administered in the same adjuvant, mEnv elicited higher magnitude nAb titers against tier 1 B clade B
 .5 viruses Bal.26 and SS1196.1 (P<0.05; unpaired t-tests) (Figure 15A - 15B). in contrast, cEnv induced
    higher responses than did mEnv against clade A and clade C viruses (MW965.26, DJ263.8, TV1.21,
    MS208.1, Q23.17 and ZM109F; P<0.05, unpaired t-tests) (Figure 15A - 15B).
              Importantly, the nAb responses elicited by the bivalent mEnv and cEnv mixture appeared additive
    (Figure 15A). These data suggest that the combination induced increased breadth than either mEnv or
30  cEnv alone, and nAb responses to each isolate induced by the combination were typically comparable to
    the higher of the two individual trimers (Figure 15A - 15B). These data indicate that the mEnv and cEnv
    mixture conferred an immunologic advantage compared with either trimer alone. Comparable results
    were observed in guinea pigs receiving mEnv, cEnv, or bivalent mEnv and cEnv mixture in
    CpG/Emulsigen adjuvants (Figure 15C - 15D). Overall, these data suggest that the mEnv and cEnv
35  trimers were complementary and could be effectively combined as a mixture that was superior to either
    trimer alone in terms of nAb coverage.
              Previous studies with cEnv demonstrated sporadic and low level tier 2 nAb responses by TZM.bl
    assay (Kovacs et al. (2012) Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 109:12111; Nkolola et al. (2010) J. Virol.
    84:3270). We therefore opted to utilize the more sensitive A3R5 assay to compare tier 2 nAb activity in
40  these groups of animals. Both cEnv and mEnv induced detectable tier 2 nAbs against C viruses
    (Ce1086_B2, Ce2010, Du422) (Figure 16A) and clade B viruses (SUMA, SC22.3C2) (Figure 16B). The
                                                          40

       WO 2014/107744                                                                    PCT/US2014/010543
   bivalent mEnv and cEnv mixture elicited responses that were typically comparable to the better of the two
   individual trimers (Figure 16A - 16B). In addition, low tier 2 nAb activity was detected against clade B
   virus REJO. LucR with the combined regimen but not either trimer alone (*P<0.05; Mann Whitney test)
   (Figure 16B). These data demonstrate that the mixture of immunologically complementary mEnv and
 5 cEnv trimers were superior to either trimer alone.
             We further developed an optimized version of the mEnv polypeptide, referred to herein as
   "Mosaic 1 Env gp140 version 2" or "mEnv+." As shown in Figure 2, mEnv+ (lane 4) is expressed at
   higher levels than cEnv (lane 1) or mEnv (lane 2). mEnv+ also demonstrates robust purity and stability,
   as shown by size exclusion chromatography (Figures 17A - 17B) and by SDS-PAGE profile (Figure 17C).
10 The immunogenicity of mEnv+ was comparable to that of mEnv, regardless of adjuvant used (Figures
   18A - B). Neutralization assays further demonstrated the comparable immunogenicity of mEnv+ as
   compared to mEnv (Figure 19).
