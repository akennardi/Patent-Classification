      SYSTEM FOR COUPLING TOGETHER SEGMENTS OF A UTILITY POLE,
             AND A UTILITY POLE ASSEMBLY COMPRISING THE SAME
 5                          BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Field of the Invention
   [0001]      There is provided a coupling system. In particular, there is provided a
10 coupling system for coupling together segments of a utility pole and a utility pole
   assembly comprising the same.
   Description of the Related Art
   [0002]      United States Patent No. 4,272,929 to Hanson discloses a tower for a wind
15 generator. The tower comprises a plurality of segments where each segment fits into the
   one below it and is adjustable relative that lower segment. The lower segment is anchored
   in the ground and includes a stirrup which holds the lowest section of the tower a distance
   above the bottom of the hole so that when cement is poured into the hole to anchor the
   tower, the cement flows up into the interior of the tower to give additional support.
20 Adjustment means in the form of set screws are provided where each pair of sections join
   to allow alignment of the sections to vertical.
   [0003]      United States Patent No. 4,543,764 to Kozikowski discloses forming one or
   more sheets about standing poles to try to enhance the structural characteristics of the
   poles. The sheets are defined by an outer jacket, a plurality of spacer members positioned
25 within the jacket and a solidified encapsulating material which fills the jacket.
   [0004]      One of the drawbacks of a slip fit type connection for utility poles is that the
   overlap is somewhat variable. Slip fit connections, by their nature, are variable length
                                                  1

                                                 2
   depending on many design and fabrication tolerance parameters. In an application where
   overall height is critical, such systems may not be used. Other problems include aligning
   the pole sections and taking the joint apart if this ever becomes necessary. Such systems
   also have a tendency to settle over time after installation. In some applications, this is
 5 unacceptable and slip joint connections thus cannot be used.
                               BRIEF SUMMARY OF INVENTION
   [0005]       There is accordingly provided, and it is an object to provide, an improved
10 utility pole assembly, coupling system therefor, and method of installing the same.
   [0006]       According to one aspect, there is provided a utility pole assembly. The
   assembly includes a utility pole comprising a plurality of pole segments. A first said pole
   segment includes a flange and an end portion extending outwards from the flange. A
   second said pole segment is shaped to fit about the end portion. The second said pole
15 segment has a distal end and including a flange adjacent to said distal end of the second
   said pole segment. The assembly includes at least one longitudinally-extending guide pin
   connectable with a first one of the flanges. The guide pin is at least partially extendable
   through a second one of the flanges.
   [0007]       According to another aspect, there is provided a utility pole assembly. The
20 utility pole assembly includes a utility pole comprising a plurality of pole segments. A
   first said pole segment includes a flange and an end portion extending outwards from the
   flange. A second said pole segment includes a flange adjacent to a distal end thereof. The
   second said pole segment is shaped to fit about the end portion via a slip fit connection.
   The assembly includes a plurality of elongate extraction members threadably engageable
25 with a first one of the flanges. The extraction members are abuttable against a second one
   of the flanges. Actuation of the extraction members causes the pole segments to
   disengage from the slip fit connection.

                                                   3
   [0008]        According to a further aspect, there is provided a coupling system for
   coupling a first utility pole segment to a second utility pole segment. Each of the pole
   segments has a distal end. The system includes a first flange connectable to the first
   utility pole segment at a location spaced-apart from the distal end of the first utility pole
 5 segment. The first flange defines an end portion of the first utility pole segment extending
   between the flange and the distal end of the first utility pole segment. The system
   includes a second flange connectable to the second utility pole segment adjacent to the
   distal end of the second utility pole segment. Each of the flanges has at least one fastener
   aperture extending therethrough. The second utility pole segment is shaped to fit about
10 the end portion of the first utility pole segment. The system includes at least one guide
   pin connectable with a first one of the flanges. The guide pin is extendable into a second
   one of the flanges upon the second utility pole segment extending about the end portion
   of the first utility pole segment. The fastener apertures are positioned to align with each
   other upon the guide pin connecting to the first one of the flanges and extending into the
15 second one of the flanges.
   [0009]        According to yet another aspect, there is provided a method of connecting a
   first utility pole segment to a second utility pole segment. The method includes coupling
   a first flange to the first utility pole segment adjacent to an end portion of the first utility
   pole segment. The method includes coupling a second flange to the second utility pole
20 segment adjacent to a distal end of the second utility pole segment. The method includes
   positioning the second utility pole segment about the end portion of the first utility pole
   segment. The method includes aligning the second utility pole segment relative to the
   first utility pole segment via at least one elongate alignment member. This aligning step
   includes coupling the guide pin to a first of the utility pole segments and extending
25 through a second of the utility pole segments. The method includes coupling the flanges
   of the utility pole segments so aligned together via one or more fasteners.

                   DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
20  [0011]     Referring to the drawings and first to Figure 1, there is shown a utility pole
   assembly 20. The assembly has a longitudinal axis 22. The assembly 20 includes a utility
   pole 25 comprising a plurality of pole segments, in this example a first or lower pole
   segment 24 and a second or upper pole segment 26. However, this number is not strictly
   required and the utility pole may have more than two segments in other embodiments,
25 such as six or more segments in other examples. The assembly 20 includes a conduit, in
   this example an electrical cable 29 extending through the utility pole segments 24 and 26.
    [0012]     As seen in Figure 1, the lower pole segment has an upper or distal end 30, a
   lower or proximal end 32 spaced-apart from the distal end, and a side, in this example an
   annular side 37 extending between the ends thereof. The side of the lower pole segment
30 24 extends parallel with longitudinal axis 22. The lower pole segment 24 includes a lower

                                                 7
   flange 34 adjacent to the proximal end thereof. The lower flange radially outwards and is
   shaped to couple to a base 21 of the utility pole assembly 20. The base 21 rests upon
   foundation 23. The lower pole segment 24 has two pairs of transversely-extending
   apertures positioned between the distal end 30 and the proximal end 32 thereof. This is
 5 shown in Figure 3 by aperture 33 for the first pair of apertures and aperture 35 for the
   second pair of apertures which extend through the side 37 of the lower pole segment 24.
   Each pair of apertures aligns horizontally in this example.
    [0013]     As seen in Figure 3, the lower pole segment 24 includes an upper annular
   flange 36 having an inner diameter Di. The lower pole segment has an outer diameter D2
10 adjacent to flange 36. The inner diameter Di of the flange 36 is generally equal to and
   approximately the same size as the outer diameter D 2 of the lower pole segment. The
   flange couples to, extends outwards from and extends perpendicular to side 37 of the
   lower pole segment 24 in this example.
    [0014]     The lower pole segment 24 includes an end portion 38 extending outwards, in
15 this example upwards from the flange. The end portion of the lower pole segment is
   tubular and extends from the distal end 30 of the lower pole segment to the upper flange.
   The end portion 38 slightly tapers radially inwards as the end portion extends from flange
   36 to distal end 30 of the lower pole segment in this example. The lower pole segment 24
   has an outer diameter D3 at the distal end 30 thereof which is less than the outer diameter
20 D2 of the lower pole segment and inner diameter Di of the flange 36. The flange 36 in this
   example extends radially outwards and is coupled to the lower pole segment, in this
   example via weld 40. Thus, the tapered end portion 38 of the lower pole segment 24
   extends through the flange 36 and the flange is welded to the lower pole segment
   thereafter.
25  [0015]     As seen in Figure 3, transversally-extending apertures 33 and 35 are adjacent
   to the upper flange 36 in this example. As seen in Figure 4, the flange has a generally
   annular top 41 and, as seen in Figure 3, a generally annular bottom 43.

                                                   8
   [0016]       As   seen in Figure 4, the upper flange 36            includes   a plurality   of
   circumferentially spaced-apart, radially outwardly extending protrusions, in this example
   three protrusions 42, 44 and 46. Each of the protrusions has a substantially planar top and
   bottom and is generally rectangular in shape in this example. This is shown in Figure 3
 5 by protrusion 42 have a top 45 and bottom 47. The flange 36 has a plurality of
   circumferentially spaced-apart fastener apertures extending therethrough, in this example
   in the form of a pair of spaced-apart fastener apertures per protrusion. This is shown by
   fastener apertures 48 and 50 extending through protrusion 42 of the flange.
   [0017]       The upper flange 36 has a plurality of circumferentially spaced-apart
10 additional apertures extending therethrough in this embodiment, in this example in the
   form of one threaded, guide pin aperture per protrusion. This is shown by in Figure 3 by
   guide pin aperture 52 extending through protrusion 42 of the flange. Having the guide
   pins threaded into the flange 36 after the latter has been galvanized and prior to the
   transportation of the various parts of the assembly 20 may inhibit damage of the guide
15 pins. This may also reduce operator installation time and facilitate subsequent assembly
   of the utility pole 25. Each of the guide pin apertures 52 is between paired ones 48 and 50
   of the fastener apertures of the protrusions 42 of the flange 36 of the lower pole segment
   24 in this example.
   [0018]       As seen in Figure 3, the utility pole assembly 20 includes at least one, and this
20 example a plurality of circumferentially spaced-apart, longitudinally-extending alignment
   members, such as keys or in this example guide pins. In this case the assembly includes
   three guide pins 54, 56 and 58. However, this number is not strictly required and there
   may be only one guide pin, a pair of guide pins, or more than three guide pins in other
   examples. The guide pins 54, 56 and 58 extend longitudinally parallel with the
25 longitudinal axis 22 of the assembly 20. Each guide pin has a head in this example in the
   form a nut 60, a threaded portion 62 adjacent to the nut, and an elongate shaft 64 coupled
   to and extending outwards from the threaded portion in this example. The nut is welded
   to the rest of the guide pin in this example. Each guide pin has a tapered end 65 spaced
   apart from the nut 60 thereof. The guide pins 54, 56 and 58 are connectable to flange 36

                                                 9
   of the lower pole segment 24 in this example by inserting the pins from below the flange
   such that the nuts 60 abut the bottom 43 of the flange, as seen in Figure 4.
    [0019]     Referring back to Figure 3, the threaded portions 62 of the guide pins 54 are
   shaped to threadably engage with respective ones of the guide pin apertures 52.
 5 Engagement of the nut 60 with a wrench enables the guide pin to be threadably secured to
   the flange 36. As seen in Figure 4, each of the guide pins is thus positioned between
   paired ones 48 and 50 of the fastener apertures of the flange 36 of the lower pole segment
   24 in this example. The guide pins are thus connectable to and extend axially outwards
   from respective ones of the protrusions of the flange of the lower pole segment 24.
10  [0020]     Referring to Figure 1, the upper pole segment 26 has a first or upper end 66, a
   second, lower, or distal end 68 spaced-apart from the upper end, and a side, in this
   example an annular side 69 extending between the ends thereof. The side of the upper
   pole segment 26 extends parallel with longitudinal axis 22. The upper pole segment has
   two pairs of transversely-extending apertures adjacent to the upper end 66 thereof. This is
15 shown in Figure 2 by a first pair of apertures 70 and 72 and a second pair of apertures 74
   and 76.
    [0021]     Referring to Figure 1, the upper pole segment 26 may be raised and positioned
   in place relative to the lower pole segment 24 via a lifting machine, in this example a
   crane 78. The crane includes a telescopic arm 80, a cable 82 extending from the arm and
20 a crane hook 84 coupled to the cable. Cranes per se, including their various parts and
   functionings, are known to those skilled in the art and thus crane 78 will not be described
   in detail.
    [0022]     As seen in Figure 2, the upper pole segment 26 couples to the hook in this
   example via a pair of elongate members 86 and 88 which threadably couple to the pole
25 segment via the first pair of apertures 70 and 72 and second pair of apertures 74 and 76,
   and a strap 90 which extends between and couples together the elongate members and the
   hook. The elongate members and strap are shown partially in ghost in Figure 2. In a like

                                                   10
   manner, the lower pole segment 24 seen in Figure 3 may be selectively raised and moved
   in place by the crane by extending elongate members through apertures 33 and 35 of the
   lower pole segment.
    [0023]      Still referring to Figure 3, at least the distal end portion 92 of the upper pole
 5 segment 26 is shaped to fit about the end portion 38 of the lower pole segment via a slip
   fit connection. The end portion of the lower pole segment 24 is shown partially in ghost
   in Figure 4.
    [0024]     As seen in Figure 4, the upper pole segment includes a flange 94 adjacent to
   the distal end 68 thereof. The flange has an inner diameter D4 . The upper pole segment 26
10 has an outer diameter Ds adjacent to flange 94. The inner diameter D4 of flange 94 is
   generally equal to and approximately the same size as the outer diameter Ds of the upper
   pole segment. The flange couples to, extends outwards from and extends perpendicular to
   side 69 of the upper pole segment 26 in this example. The flange in this example extends
   radially outwards and is coupled to the upper pole segment 26 in this example via weld
15 96. The flange 94 extends about and is welded to the distal end 68 of the upper pole
   segment. The flange 94 has a generally annular top 98 and a generally annular bottom
    100 spaced-apart from the top thereof.
    [0025]      Still referring to Figure 4, flange 94 includes a plurality of circumferentially
   spaced-apart, radially outwardly extending protrusions, in this example three protrusions
20  102, 104, and 106. Each of the protrusions has a substantially planar top and bottom and
   is generally rectangular in shape in this example. This is shown in Figure 3 by protrusion
    102 having a top 103 and bottom 105. The flange 94 has a plurality of circumferentially
   spaced-apart fastener apertures extending therethrough, in this example in the form of a
   pair of spaced-apart fastener apertures per protrusion. This is shown by fastener apertures
25  108 and 110 extending through protrusion 102 of the flange.
    [0026]     The flange 94 has a plurality of circumferentially spaced-apart additional
   apertures extending therethrough in this embodiment, in this example in the form of one

                                                 11
   alignment aperture per protrusion. This is shown in Figure 4 by alignment aperture 112
   extending through protrusion 102 of the flange. Each of the alignment apertures 112 is
   between paired ones 108 and 110 of the fastener apertures of the protrusions of the flange
   94 of the upper pole segment 26 in this example.
 5  [0027]     As seen in Figure 6, the utility pole assembly 20 further includes a plurality of
   elongate extraction members, in this example extraction bolts threadably coupled to the
   upper flange 94. In this example there are three extraction bolts, as shown by bolts 113
   and 115 in Figure 6. Each bolt is positioned between a pair of the protrusions of flange 94
   in this example. This shown by bolt 113 positioned between protrusions 102 and 104.
10  [0028]     Referring to Figure 5, the guide pins 54, 56 and 58 are shaped to be
   extendable through respective ones of the alignment apertures 112 of flange 94 of the
   upper pole segment 26. The fastener apertures 108 and 110 of flange 94 are positioned to
   align with respective ones of the fastener apertures 48 and 50 of flange 36 of the lower
   pole segment 24 upon the guide pins extending through the flange 94 of the upper pole
15 segment. The protrusions 42, 44 and 46 of flange 36 of the lower pole segment 24 align
   within the protrusions 102, 104 and 106 of flange 94 of the upper pole segment 26 upon
   the guide pins 54, 56 and 58 extending through the flange of the upper pole segment. As
   seen in Figure 4, the upper pole segment 26 so aligned is thus shaped to extend about and
   slip fit with the end portion 38 of the lower pole segment 24 with, as seen in Figure 5,
20 bottom 100 of flange 94 abutting the top 41 of flange 36.
    [0029]     As seen in Figure 6, the utility pole assembly 20 includes a plurality of
   fasteners shaped to extend through the fastener apertures of the flanges 94 and 36 so
   aligned, to selectively couple together the flanges. The fasteners in this example are in the
   form of a plurality of nuts and bolts shaped to threadably engage with respective ones of
25 the nuts. This is shown in Figure 7 by nut 114 abutting bottom 43 of flange 36 and
   threadably engaging with bolt 116. As seen in Figure 6, each bolt has a bolt head 118
   which abuts the top 98 of flange 94 in this example.

                                                  12
    [0030]      Referring to Figure 1, there is thus herein provided a method of connecting a
   first, in this example upper pole segment 26 to a second, in this example lower pole
   segment 24.
    [0031]      As seen in Figure 4, the method includes providing flange 36 with a plurality
 5 of circumferentially spaced-apart, axially-extending guide pins 54, 56 and 58. The
   method includes coupling the guide pins to the flange, in this example via threaded
   engagement of the pins with the flange.
    [0032]      The method includes providing flange 94 with a plurality of circumferentially
   spaced-apart alignment apertures 112 which align with respective ones of the guide pins
10 of flange 94.
    [0033]      Referring to Figure 3, the method further includes providing flange 36 with a
   plurality of circumferentially spaced-apart apertures 48 and 50. The method includes
   providing flange 94 with a plurality of circumferentially spaced-apart apertures 108 and
    110 which align with the apertures of the first of the flanges upon the guide pins 54, 56
15 and 58 being inserted through flange 94.
    [0034]      The method includes extending tapered end portion 38 of the lower pole
   segment 24 through flange 36 and thereafter welding the flange to the annular side 37 of
   the lower pole segment. The method thus includes coupling flange 36 to the lower pole
   segment adjacent to the end portion 38 thereof via weld 40 in this example.
20  [0035]      The method includes positioning flange 94 adjacent to distal end 68 of the
   upper pole segment 26 and thereafter welding the flange to annular side 69 of the upper
   pole segment. The method thus further includes coupling flange 94 to the upper pole
   segment 26 adjacent to distal end 68 thereof.

                                                 13
    [0036]     As seen with reference to Figures 1 and 4, the method includes positioning the
   upper pole segment about the end portion 38 of the lower pole segment 24 in this
   example via a crane 78. Referring to Figure 4, the method includes selectively rotating
   via the crane the upper pole segment relative to the lower pole segment, as shown by
 5 arrow of numeral 120, so as to align the upper pole segment relative to the lower pole
   segment via guide pins 54, 56 and 58. The alignment step includes coupling the guide
   pins to flange 36 and thereafter extending the guide pins through the flange 94 via the
   alignment apertures 112 of flange 94.
    [0037]     Referring to Figures 6 and 7, the method includes coupling the flanges 36 and
10 94 of the utility pole segments 24 and 26 so aligned together via fasteners, in this
   example nuts 114 and bolts 116.
    [0038]     As seen in Figure 4, the flanges 36 and 94 so shaped and guide pins 54, 56
   and 58 comprise a coupling system 28 for coupling the upper pole segment 26 to the
   lower pole segment 24. The end portion 38 of the lower pole segment is part of this
15 coupling system.
    [0039]     A slip fit connection of the assembly may be most effective when it is tapered,
   because such a configuration promotes a tight, no-gap friction fit which may put a
   connection in a different, better fatigue category than a welded flange connection. The
   assembly 20 as herein described may be said to incorporate a fixed designed length
20 connection. The assembly so configured is designed for a small clearance in the slip-fit
   that allows the flanges to always come in contact, while taking advantage of the slip fit
   feature also as it relates to assembly and servicing. Thus, as seen in Figure 5A, the
   assembly 20 has a small radially-inwardly extending clearance or gap extending between
   the end portion 38 of lower pole segment 24 at a location adjacent to flange 36 and the
25 upper pole segment 26 at a location adjacent to the flange 94 of the upper pole segment.
   This gap enables the flanges 36 and 94 to abut with each other. The guide pins are shaped
   to be long enough to lock the orientation of the upper utility pole segment 26 of the utility
   pole 25 before the taper of the slip-fit connection engages.

                                                 14
    [0040]     Referring to Figure 6, in order to disassemble the upper pole segment 26 from
   the lower pole segment 24, nuts 114 and bolts 116 are removed. Referring to Figure 8,
   extraction bolts 113 and 115 may next be selectively actuated or extended, causing the
   extraction bolts to abut and push against the top 41 of flange 36. This thereby results in
 5 flange 94 being spaced-apart from flange 36 as seen in Figure 8. Thereafter and referring
   to Figure 1, crane 78 may be used to remove upper pole segment 26 from lower pole
   segment 24 in a like manner as described above.
    [0041]     Alternatively, one or more guide pins themselves may be reversed and
   thereafter used to function as the extraction bolts.
10  [0042]     Figures 9 and 10 show a utility pole assembly 20.1 according to a second
   aspect. Like parts have like numbers and functions as the utility pole assembly 20 shown
   in Figures 1 to 8 with the addition of decimal extension ".1". Utility pole assembly 20.1
   is the same as described for utility pole assembly 20 shown in Figures 1 to 8 with the
   following exception.
15  [0043]     In this embodiment, the guide pins 54.1, 56.1 and 58.1 are press-fit to the
   apertures 52.1 of the flange 36.1 of the lower pole segment 24.1. The end portion 38.1 of
   the lower pole segment 24.1 is shown partially in ghost in Figure 9 and fully in ghost in
   Figure 10.
    [0044]     Figures 11 and 12 show a utility pole assembly 20.2 according to a third
20 aspect. Like parts have like numbers and functions as the utility pole assembly 20 shown
   in Figures 1 to 8 with the addition of decimal extension ".2". Utility pole assembly 20.2
   is the same as described for utility pole assembly 20 shown in Figures 1 to 8 with the
   following exceptions.
    [0045]     In this embodiment, flange 94.2 is spaced-apart upwards from the distal end
25 68.2 of the upper pole segment 26.2. The upper pole segment 26.2 has an outer diameter

                                                  15
   D6  adjacent to flange 94.2. The inner diameter D4.2 of the flange 94.2 is generally equal to
   and approximately the same size as the outer diameter D6 of the upper pole segment. The
   distal end portion 92.2 of the upper pole segment in this example extends downwards
   from the flange. The distal end portion of the upper pole segment 26.2 is tubular and
 5 extends from the distal end 68.2 of the upper pole segment to flange 94.2. The distal end
   portion 92.2 tapers slightly radially inwards as the distal end portion extends from flange
   94.2 to distal end 68.2 of the upper pole segment. The outer diameter Ds. 2 of the upper
   pole segment 26.2 at the distal end 68.2 of the upper pole segment is less than the outer
   diameter D6 of the upper pole segment and inner diameter D4.2 of flange 94. Thus, the
10 tapered end portion 92.2 of the upper pole segment 26.2 extends through the flange 94.2
   and the flange is welded to the upper pole segment thereafter.
    [0046]     As seen in Figure 11, in this embodiment flange 36.2 is adjacent to the distal
   end 30.2 of the lower pole segment 24.2. Thus, flange 36.2 extends about and is welded
   to the distal end 30.2 of the lower pole segment 24.2. At least the upper end portion 38.2
15 of the lower pole segment 24.2 is shaped to extend or fit about the end portion 92.2 of the
   upper pole segment 26.2 in a slip fit manner, as seen in Figure 12. The end portion of the
   upper pole segment is shown in ghost in Figure 12. The assembly 20.2 otherwise
   generally couples together in a like manner as described for assembly 20. The outer
   diameters D 3.2 and D 2.2 of the lower pole segment 24.2 align with each other and are
20 generally the same size.
    [0047]     The assembly 20.2 in this embodiment may incorporate either a reversed
   tapered or straight fit connection. It is also possible to arrange the guide pins reversed as
   a variation but to keep the flange arrangement the same.
    [0048]      The utility pole assemblies 20, 20.1 and 20.2 as herein described provide
25 many advantages. Each assembly incorporates ease of assembly with the strength of a
   slip fit connection with the precision of a flanged connection. The assemblies 20, 20.1
   and 20.2 as herein described enable a slip joint type connection with a fixed overlap. By
   taking advantage of the strength of the slip fit connection, the flange size and number of

                                                  16
   bolts of the assemblies, as well as the welded connection may be greatly reduced,
   reducing the cost of the connection.
    [0049]      The guide pins 54, 56, 58, 54.1, 56.1 and 58.1 as herein described facilitate
   alignment of the utility pole segments 24, 26, 24.1, 26.1, 24.2 and 26.2. The guide pins
 5 ensure proper alignment of the fastener apertures of the flanges once the pins are engaged
   with the flange on the other of the pole segments. The length of guide pins enables this
   alignment of the utility pole segments prior to the slip-fit pole sections of the utility pole
   segments being engaged. The number of guide pins can vary and the guide pins may be
   permanent or removable. A portable drift pin or a pry bar may also be used in lieu of
10 fixed pins, for example.
    [0050]      Once the guide pins are engaged, the assembly as herein described enables the
   crane to be redeployed, thereby significantly reducing crane time utilizes during
   installation. Thus, once the upper pole segment is stacked and the alignment pin(s) are
   engaged, the crane can be released to go to the assembly. The final engagement of the
15 slip fit can be achieved later with the flange bolts and this feature saves valuable crane
   time.
    [0051]      The extraction bolts 113, 115, 113.1, 115.1,       113.2, and 115.2 as herein
   described facilitate selective removal of the utility pole segments should this be required.
   This disassembly provision may thus be said to provide an easy method for disassembly
20 if required.
    [0052]      The slip fit connections as herein described have been tapered, with the end
   portion of a first of the utility pole segments being tapered to fit with the end portion of a
   second of the utility pole segments. Alternatively, the end portions may be configured
   without a taper, such that a straight-fit connection is provided.

                                               17
  [0053]      It will be appreciated that many variations are possible within the scope of the
  invention described herein. For example, the flanges as herein described are welded to
  the utility pole segments. However, this is not strictly required and the flanges may
  couple to the utility pole segments in other manners in other embodiments for example,
5 or may be integrally connected to and formed with the pole segment in other examples.
  [0054]      It will also be understood by someone skilled in the art that many of the
  details provided above are by way of example only and are not intended to limit the scope
  of the invention which is to be determined with reference to at least the following claims.
