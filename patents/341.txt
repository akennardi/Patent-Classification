   Field
   The present invention relates to a method of enabling
   restoration of games, a method of restoring games, a game
20 controller, a gaming machine and a gaming system.
   Background
   Some electronic wagering games unlock game features as a
25 player progresses through different stages. Such games may
   require significant amount of game play to progress through
   the different stages to unlock the game features. Accordingly,
   a player who decides to cash out may be discouraged from
   playing the same game again because the player has to go
30 through the same stages to unlock the same game features.
   There is thus a need to enable a player to save a game.

   Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming device
   having a game controller configured to employ one of a
25 plurality of game state identifiers associated with respective
   ones of a plurality of game states to enable a game to be
   restored or to restore a game. Advantageously, the game state
   identifiers allow the game controller to easily duplicate game
   states when enabling a game to be restored. This allows
30 players to restore a game at a later time, for example, to
   access game features previously unlocked in the game.
   In certain embodiments, the gaming device is provided as part
   of a gaming system, where the game controller also relies on a
35 session identifier from a session server. The session
   identifier provides a simple yet effective way of controlling
   the number of times a game may be restored, typically so it
   can only be restored once.
40 It is envisaged that a game state corresponds to a particular
   stage of a game. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate

   that a game state need not correspond only to the end or
   beginning of a stage of a game and that a game state may
   correspond to any point of a game. For example, a game state
   may correspond to the middle of a game stage where a new game
 5 feature is unlocked.
   It is envisaged that a predetermined plurality of game state
   identifiers are associated with respective ones of the
   plurality of game states. It is envisaged that each game state
10 is associated with a game state identifier by a game state
   mapper configured to map the game state to the game state
   identifier. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that
   the game state mapper may be implemented by a processor of a
   computer based on computer program code stored in a memory or
15 other tangible storage medium. Herein the term "processor" is
   used to refer generically to any device that can process game
   instructions and may include: a microprocessor,
   microcontroller, programmable logic device or other
   computational device, a general purpose computer  (for example,
20 a PC) or a server.
   General construction of the gaming device
   In an embodiment, the gaming device is a stand alone gaming
25 machine wherein all or most components required for enabling
   restoration of games or for restoring games are present in a
   player operable gaming machine.
   The gaming device has several core components. At the broadest
30 level, the core components are a player interface 50 and a
   game controller 60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player
   interface is arranged to enable manual interaction between a
   player and the gaming device and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
35 instructions to play a game, observe game outcomes, to enable
   restoration of a game, or to restore a game.
   Components of the player interface may vary from embodiment to
   embodiment but will typically include a credit mechanism 52 to
40 enable a player to input credits and receive payouts, one or

   more displays 54, a game play mechanism 56 including one or
   more input devices that enable a player to input game play
   instructions  (e.g. to enable a player to input/output
   instructions for enabling the restoration of a game or for
 5 restoring a game),  and one or more speakers 58.
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62 that
   processes the game play instructions in accordance with game
10 play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the display.
   Typically, the game play rules are stored as program code in a
   memory 64 but can also be hardwired. As discussed earlier, a
   "processor" may be any device that may be arranged or
   configured to process game play instructions in accordance
15 with game play rules and may include:  a microprocessor,
   microcontroller, programmable logic device or other
   computational device, a general purpose computer   (e.g. a PC)
   or a server.
20 A gaming device in the form of a stand alone gaming machine 10
   is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine 10 includes a
   console 12 having a display 14 on which are displayed
   representations of a game 16 that can be played by a player.
   Although not illustrated, the gaming machine also includes
25 readers/printers for a player to insert a ticket and/or to
   retrieve a ticket printed by the gaming machine, a keypad for
   a player to enter game restoration information and a
   transmitter for sending out game restoration information. A
   mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10 houses a bank of buttons
30 22 for enabling a player to interact with the gaming machine,
   in particular during game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a
   credit input mechanism 24 which in this example includes a
   coin input chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit
   input mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
35 reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit card.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example pay
   tables and details of bonus awards and other information or
   images relating to the game.   Further artwork and/or
40 information may be provided on a front panel 29 of the console

   12.  A coin tray 30 is mounted beneath the front panel 29 for
   dispensing cash payouts from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
 5 display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen device.
   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid crystal display,
   plasma screen, any other suitable video display unit, or the
   visible portion of an electromechanical device.   The top box
   26 may also include a display, for example a video display
10 unit, which may be of the same type as the display 14, or of a
   different type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of a
   typical gaming machine which may be the same as or different
15 to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101 having a
   processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.  Instructions and
   data to control operation of the processor 102 are stored in a
20 memory 103, which is in data communication with the processor
   102.  Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 103.
25
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for ensuring
   regulatory compliance and monitoring player credit, an
   input/output (I/0) interface 105 for communicating with
   peripheral devices of the gaming machine 100.   The
30 input/output interface 105 and/or the peripheral devices may
   be intelligent devices with their own memory for storing
   associated instructions and data for use with the input/output
   interface or the peripheral devices.  A random number
   generator module 113 generates random numbers for use by the
35 processor 102.  Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
   that the reference to random numbers includes pseudo-random
   numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
40 includes game restoration devices that communicate with the

   game controller 101. These include a ticket printer 109, a
   ticket reader 108, an identifier transmitter 114 and a keypad
   115. In addition, the player interface also comprise
   peripheral devices including one or more displays 106, a touch
 5 screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism), a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110
   and a coin output mechanism 111.   Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware may be
   omitted as required for the specific implementation. For
10 example, while buttons or touch screens are typically used in
   gaming machines to allow a player to place a wager and
   initiate a play of a game any input device that enables the
   player to input game play instructions may be used.
15 In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.   The
   network card may, for example, send requests for information
   or other information to a session server and receive requests
   for information or other information from a session server.
20
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of an
   exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM 103A, EPROM
   103B and a mass storage device 103C.   The RAM 103A typically
   temporarily holds program files for execution by the processor
25 102 and related data.  The EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device
   and/or may contain some system or game related code.   The mass
   storage device 103C is typically used to store game programs,
   the integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B or
30 elsewhere.
   General construction of the gaming device as part of a gaming
   system
35 In another embodiment, the gaming device is part of a gaming
   system wherein some of the components required for enabling
   restoration of games or restoring games are present in a
   player operable gaming machine and some of the components
   required for implementing the game are located remotely
40 relative to the gaming machine.   For example, some of the

   steps for enabling the restoration of a game may be executed
   on a player operable gaming machine and some of the steps for
   restoring a game may be executed remotely by a session server.
 5 In addition, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, a gaming system may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a session server and
   the respective functions of the gaming machine and the gaming
   server are selectively modifiable.  For example, the gaming
10 machine, although part of the gaming system, may operate in
   stand alone gaming machine mode depending on the game being
   played, operating conditions, and so on. Other variations will
   be apparent to persons skilled in the art.
15 Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a network 201,
   which for example may be an Ethernet network. Gaming machines
   202A,202B,202C in Figure 5 are connected to the network 201.
   The gaming machines 202A,202B,202C each provide a player
20 operable interface and may be the same as the gaming machines
   10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have simplified
   functionality depending on the requirements for enabling
   restoration of games and for restoring games.  While gaming
   machines 202A,202B,202C are illustrated as being individually
25 connected to the network 201, banks of two or more gaming
   machines are also envisaged.
   In Figure 5, there is also illustrated a session server 206
   for administering session identifiers that are stored in a
30 database 207. As discussed earlier, these session identifiers
   may be used together with the game state identifiers to enable
   the restoration of a game or to restore a game played in any
   one of the gaming machines 202A,202B,202C. In Figure 5, the
   session server 206 is illustrated as a central server that
35 communicates with all of the gaming machines 202A,202B,202C.
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet, for
40 example through a firewall 211.

   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in accordance
   with known techniques, the session server 206 need not be
   centralized and that the functionality at the server side of
 5 the network may be distributed over a plurality of different
   computers.  For example, elements may be run as a single
   "engine" on one server or a separate server may be provided.
   That is, the session server can be implemented in a
   distributed fashion wherein the gaming machines are connected
10 to separate session servers each of which is able to
   communicate with the database 207. It is also envisaged that
   the database 207 itself may be implemented in a distributed
   fashion. For example, a central session server 206 can
   communicate with multiple databases so that some of the
15 session identifiers are stored in one database and the other
   session identifiers are stored in another database.
   Further detail of the gaming system
20 Figure 6 illustrates, in an embodiment, the game controller of
   a gaming device. In Figure 6, the game controller 60 is shown
   implementing a number of modules to enable the restoration of
   a game. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the
   modules are based typically on program code 641 and data
25 stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the art will also
   appreciate that the modules are implemented typically using
   processor 62 but that some of the modules could be implemented
   in some other way, for example by a dedicated circuit.
30 In Figure 6, the modules include a restoration request
   receiver 310 which operates in response to a player's
   operation of player interface 50 by having the player operate
   an input device 56  (e.g. pressing the touch screen and/or one
   of more buttons) to receive a request for subsequent
35 restoration of a game. The restoration request receiver 310 is
   also arranged to communicate the request for subsequent
   restoration of a game to a session identifier requestor 320
   and a game state identifier selector 340. The session
   identifier requestor 320 is arranged to make a request for a
40 session identifier from a session server 306. In an

   embodiment, this request for a session identifier can be
   transmitted through a network via a network card of a gaming
   device. The session server 306 is arranged to receive this
   request. A session identifier generator 370 is arranged to
 5 generate a session identifier. Persons skilled in the art
   would appreciate that this can be done in a variety of ways
   (for example by generating a pseudo-random number sequence)
   and that the session identifier can be of a variety of lengths
   (for example, a 16 bit sequence) and/or be in different format
10 (for example, a hexadecimal sequence). The session server 306
   is arranged to output the session identifier upon receiving
   this request to a session identifier issuer 330. The session
   generator 306 is also arranged to transmit the newly generated
   session identifier to a session identifier database 380 to
15 update the database. The session identifier database 380 is
   arranged to store the session identifiers that have been
   issued. The session identifier issuer 330 is arranged to issue
   the session identifier to the player interface 50.
20 The game state identifier selector 340 is arranged to select
   one of a plurality of game state identifiers associated with
   respective ones of a plurality of game states based on the
   current game state presented at the gaming device. In this
   embodiment, the game state identifier selector 340 is arranged
25 to select a game state identifier from a game state identifier
   database 360. The game state identifier database 360 is
   arranged to store a predetermined set of game state
   identifiers corresponding to various game states. The game
   state identifier selector 340 is arranged so that the selected
30 game state identifier can be communicated to a game state
   issuer 350 which is arranged to issue the game state
   identifier to the player interface 50.
   The player interface 50 is arranged so that either the session
35 identifier or the game state identifier or both the session
   identifier and the game state identifier can be output to a
   user. In this embodiment, a ticket printer 309 is used to
   output the session identifier and/or the game state identifier
   by printing a ticket comprising either the session identifier
40 or the game state identifier or both the session identifier

   and the game state identifier. In an alternative embodiment,
   either or both the session identifier and/or the game state
   identifier can be output to a user by an identifier
   transmitter which transmits a Short Messaging Service (SMS)
 5 message comprising either the session identifier or the game
   state identifier or both the session identifier and the game
   state identifier. Typically, users are output with both a game
   state identifier and a session identifier.
10 Figure 7 illustrates the game controller 60 implementing a set
   of modules to restore a game. As with Figure 6, persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the modules are
   typically implemented by processor 62 based on program code
   642 stored in memory 64 but that some of the modules could be
15 implemented in some other way, for example by a dedicated
   circuit.
   The modules include a game state identifier receiver 410
   arranged to receive a game state identifier from the player
20 interface 50. In this embodiment, a game state identifier is
   received when a player inserts a ticket comprising the game
   state identifier into a ticket reader 408. Alternatively, a
   game state identifier may be received when a player enters the
   game state identifier on one of the input devices 56 of the
25 gaming device  (e.g. by entering the game state identifier on a
   keypad). Person skilled in the art will appreciate that an
   input device can be used in various ways so as to allow a game
   state identifier to be received; for example, a "virtual"
   keypad on the touch screen of the gaming device can be used to
30 enter the game state identifier.
   The modules of the game controller 60 also include a session
   identifier receiver 420 arranged to receive a session
   identifier from the player interface 50. In this embodiment, a
35 session identifier is received when a player inserts a ticket
   comprising the session identifier into the ticket reader 408.
   It is envisaged that a ticket can comprise either the game
   state identifier or the session identifier or both the session
   identifier and the game state identifier. In an alternative
40 embodiment, the session identifier can be received when a

   player enters the session identifier using one of the input
   devices 56. It is envisaged that a player may enter a game
   state identifier  (or a session identifier) using one of the
   input devices 56 but use a ticket to provide the session
 5 identifier (or game state identifier).
   The session identifier receiver 420 is arranged so that the
   session identifier received from the player interface 50 may
   be communicated to the session identifier communicator 430 so
10 as to determine whether the session identifier received from
   the player interface 50 has been previously used to restore a
   game. In an embodiment, this communication is transmitted
   through a network via the network card. In this embodiment, a
   session identifier verifier 470 is arranged to determine
15 whether the session identifier received from the player
   interface 50 has been previously used to restore a game by
   searching through a session identifier database 480 which
   stores the session identifiers that have been issued by not
   previously used to restore a game. The session identifier
20 communicator 430 is arranged so that the result of this
   determination can be communicated to a game state  restorer
   440. Person skilled in the art will appreciate that the
   determination of whether the session identifier received from
   the player interface 50 has been previously used to restore a
25 game can also be done in a variety of ways and can depend on
   how the session identifier was issued. The session identifier
   communicator 430 is also arranged to communicate to the game
   state restorer 440 that an otherwise invalid session
   identifier was received from the player interface 50.  In this
30 embodiment, once the session identifier verifier 470
   determines that the session identifier from the player
   interface 50 has not been previously used to restore a game,
   it deletes the session identifier listed in the session
   identifier database 480 so that the same session identifier
35 cannot be used in the future to restore another game. Persons
   skilled in the art would appreciate that the session
   identifier verifier need not always restrict each session
   identifier to be used only once. For example, each session
   identifier stored in the session identifier database can be
40 associated with a count value that is decremented each time a

   session identifier is used to restore a game. In this way,
   each session identifier can be used to restore a game a
   plurality of times instead of just once.
 5 The game state restorer 440 is arranged to restore a game at
   the gaming device to one of a plurality of game states
   associated with respective ones of a plurality of game state
   identifiers based on the game state identifier communicated
   from the game state identifier receiver 410 if the game state
10 restorer 440 receives from the session identifier communicator
   430 the determination that the session identifier has not yet
   been used and is otherwise valid. In this embodiment, the game
   state restorer 440 is arranged to restore a game by restoring
   the game to the game state that is associated with the game
15 state identifier communicated from the game state identifier
   receiver 410.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a game
   controller will typically implement not only the modules of
20 Figure 6 but also the modules of Figure 7. Accordingly, a game
   controller may be used both to enable restoration of games and
   to restore games.
   The method of enabling restoration of games is outlined in
25 Figure 8. First, a request for enabling restoration of a game
   is received at a gaming device 810. This request may be
   initiated by a player using a touch screen and/or buttons of
   the gaming device during play of a game. After the request is
   received, one of a plurality of game state identifiers (each
30 associated with a respective one of plurality of game states)
   is selected based on the game state currently being presented
   at the gaming device 820. A request for a session identifier
   from the session server is also made 830 after the request for
   enabling restoration is received. After a session identifier
35 is received from the session server 840, the selected game
   state identifier and the received session identifier is then
   issued 850 and a ticket printer prints a ticket comprising the
   game identifier and session identifier. Once the game state
   identifier is printed, the game presented at gaming machine is
40 stopped and a database is updated to reflect that the

   particular session identifier has been issued.
   Person skilled in the art will appreciate that the game
   identifier and/or session identifier can be issued in other
 5 ways. For example, the session identifier can be issued by
   requesting the player to enter his/her mobile phone number on
   the keypad of a gaming device that is connected via a network
   to a SMS Gateway and transmitting from the SMS Gateway a Short
   Messaging Service  (SMS) message comprising the game identifier
10 and/or session identifier to the player's mobile phone, where
   it will be stored in a memory of the phone.
   It is also envisaged that a player may input player
   information (such as a player's loyalty membership details)
15 via a keypad, touch screen and/or buttons to register the
   ticket before or after the ticket is printed by a ticket
   printer so that the player can restore a game even if he has
   lost the ticket.
20 Additionally, the ticket, game state identifier and/or session
   identifier may also be associated with a pin or password so
   that only the player is able to use the ticket, game state
   identifier and/or session identifier.
25 The method of restoring games corresponding to the above
   method of enabling restoration of games is illustrated in
   Figure 9. A game state identifier is first received at a
   gaming device 900. This game state identifier can be received
   by having a player enter the game state identifier manually
30 using a keypad of the gaming device or by having the player
   insert a valid ticket into the ticket reader of the gaming
   device. Next a session identifier is received 910. The session
   identifier can also be received via the keypad or the ticket
   reader of the gaming device. This can involve entering player
35 information (if the player lost his ticket) and/or entering a
   pin or associated password using the keypad, touch screen
   and/or buttons. Both the game state identifier and the session
   identifier can be received simultaneously or one can be
   received before the other. The session identifier is then
40 communicated to a session server 920. Upon receiving this

   communication, a determination as to whether the session
   identifier was previously used to restore a game is made 930.
   It is envisaged that the session identifier or the game state
   identifier may also be validated before this determination is
 5 carried out. If it is determined that the session identifier
   was previously used or either or both the session identifier
   or the game state identifier are invalid identifiers, the
   gaming device reverts back to the state of waiting to receive
   a game state identifier. If it is determined that the session
10 identifier was not previously used and that both the game
   state identifier and the session identifier are valid, the
   gaming device then proceed to restore a game to one of the
   plurality of game states based on the game state  identifier
   940.
15
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the above
   description of the gaming system. Persons skilled in the art
   will also appreciate that the method could be embodied in
   program code. The program code could be supplied in a number
20 of ways, for example on a tangible computer readable medium,
   such as a disc or a memory  (for example, that could replace
   part of memory 103) or as a data signal  (for example, by
   transmitting it from a server).
25 Similarly, it will be appreciated that the identifiers can be
   supplied on any appropriate tangible data carrier, such as by
   writing them to a magnetic swipe card, storing them in a
   memory (including transmitting identifiers to a device having
   a memory) etc.
30
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
35 embodiments of the invention can be employed to form further
   embodiments.
   It is to be understood that, if any prior art is referred to
   herein, such reference does not constitute an admission that
40 the prior art forms a part of the common general knowledge in

   the art in any country.
   In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of
   the invention, except where the context requires otherwise due
 5 to express language or necessary implication, the word
   "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising"
   is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of
   the stated features but not to preclude the presence or
   addition of further features in various embodiments of the
10 invention.
