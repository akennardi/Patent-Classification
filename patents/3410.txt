        FIELD OF THE INVENTION
        The present invention relates to drug intermediates isovaleric acid synthesis
 5 method.
        GENERAL BACKGROUND
        Isovaleric acid is used for the production of sedative hypnotics bromoisovaleride,
   but more for the production of spices, the isovalerate used as a perfume mainly includes
10 isovalerate hexahydrate, isovalerate, isopentyl isovalerate, geranyl isovalerate, benzyl
   isovalerate and cinnamyl isovalerate. Lower isovalerate esters is used for edible spices,
   and higher isovalerate esters for cosmetics. Isovalic acid natural stored in valerian oil,
   vanilla oil, hops oil, bay leaf oil, spearmint oil, etc., the Chinese national standard
   GB2760-86 provides for the use of food spices, mainly for the preparation of cheese
15 and cream flavor, but also trace for fruit flavor. However, most of the existing synthetic
   methods are using isoamyl alcohol oxidation synthesis, it is complicated and the final
   yield is not very high. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new synthetic method for
   further improving the quality and yield of the product and reducing the byproduct
   content, it has important economic significance.
