   The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent Application No.
   2013234139, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
   Introduction
 5 This disclosure relates to the isolation and sequencing of a nucleic acid molecule that
   includes a gene cluster comprising 10 genes from a noscapine producing Papaver
   somniferum [opium poppy] cultivar; transgenic cells transformed with said nucleic acid
   molecule, sequence variants of the genes; the use of said genes/proteins in the production of
   opiate alkaloids; and the use of the genes as a marker of P. somniferum plants that
10 synthesize opiate alkaloids, in particular noscapine.
   Background to Disclosure
   Noscapine belongs to the phthalideisoquinoline subclass of the structurally diverse
   isoquinoline alkaloids whereas codeine, morphine, thebaine and oripavine belong to the
   morphinan subclass. While the biosynthesis of morphinans has been elucidated at the
15 molecular level our knowledge of noscapine biosynthesis has not advanced significantly since
   the demonstration using isotope labeling in the 1960s, that it is derived from scoulerine.
   Understanding the biochemical genetics underpinning noscapine biosynthesis should enable
   improved production of noscapine and related molecules both in poppy and other expression
   systems.
20 P. somniferum is the plant from which opium is extracted. The opium poppy is the only
   commercially exploited poppy of the family Papaveraceae and is the principal source of
   natural opiates. The opium is extracted from latex harvested from the green seed pods. A
   further source of opiate alkaloids is the poppy straw which is the dried mature plant. P.
   somniferum is a source of clinically useful opiate alkaloids such as morphine, codeine,
25 thebaine, noscapine [also known as narcotine] and papaverine. The clinical application of
   these opiate alkaloids and their derivates is broad having use as analgesics, cough
   suppressants and anti-spasmodics. Although not used as a pharmacological agent in its own
   right, thebaine is a particularly useful opiate which can be converted into a range of
   compounds such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, oxymorphone,                nalbuphine naltrexone,
30 buprenorphine    and   etorphine. These      intermediates also have broad    pharmaceutical
   applications. For example, oxycodone, oxymorphone and etorphine are widely used as an
   analgesic for moderate to severe pain and are often combined with other analgesics such as
   ibuprofen. Buprenorphine is used in the treatment of heroin addiction and chronic pain.
   Naltrexone is used in the treatment of alcohol and opiate addiction.

   WO 2013/136057                                                       PCT/GB2013/050599
    This disclosure relates to transcriptomic analysis of P. somniferum noscapine producing
    cultivars compared to P. somniferum cultivars that are non-noscapine producing. The
    analysis has revealed the exclusive expression of a group of mostly cytochrome P450
    and methyltransferase genes in a poppy variety that produces noscapine. These genes
 5  are surprisingly absent from the genomes of two non-noscapine producing varieties.
    Analysis of an F2 mapping population indicated the genes are tightly linked in the
    noscapine variety and bacterial artificial chromosome sequencing confirmed they exist as
    a novel gene cluster for the biosynthesis of opiate alkaloids.

    Hybridization of a nucleic acid molecule occurs when two complementary nucleic acid
    molecules undergo an amount of hydrogen bonding to each other. The stringency of
    hybridization can vary according to the environmental conditions surrounding the nucleic

    Chemical-regulated promoters can be used to modulate the expression of a gene in a
    plant through the application of an exogenous chemical regulator. Depending upon the
    objective, the promoter may be a chemical-inducible promoter, where application of the
    chemical induced gene expression, or a chemical-repressible promoter, where
15  application of the chemical represses gene expression. Chemical-inducible promoters
    are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, the maize In2-2 promoter, which
    is activated by benzenesulfonamide herbicide safeners, the maize GST promoter, which
    is activated by hydrophobic electrophilic compounds that are used as pre-emergent
    herbicides, and the tobacco PR-1a promoter, which is activated by salicylic acid. Other
20  chemical-regulated promoters of interest include steroid-responsive promoters (see, for
    example, the glucocorticoid-inducible promoter in Schena et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad.
    Sci. USA 88: 10421-10425 and McNellis et al. (1998) Plant J. 14(2): 247-257) and
    tetracycline-inducible and tetracycline-repressible promoters (see, for example, Gatz et

    "Operably linked" means joined as part of the same nucleic acid molecule, suitably
    positioned and oriented for transcription to be initiated from the promoter. DNA operably
    linked to a promoter is "under transcriptional initiation regulation" of the promoter. In a
    preferred aspect, the promoter is a tissue specific promoter, an inducible promoter or a
 5  developmentally regulated promoter.
    Particular of interest in the present context are nucleic acid constructs which operate as
    plant vectors.   Specific procedures and vectors previously used with wide success in
    plants are described by Guerineau and Mullineaux (1993) (Plant transformation and
10  expression vectors. In: Plant Molecular Biology Labfax (Croy RRD ed) Oxford, BIOS
    Scientific Publishers, pp 121-148.        Suitable vectors may include plant viral-derived
    vectors (see e.g. EP194809). If desired, selectable genetic markers may be included in
    the construct, such as those that confer selectable phenotypes such as resistance to
    herbicides (e.g. kanamycin, hygromycin, phosphinotricin, chlorsulfuron, methotrexate,
15  gentamycin, spectinomycin, imidazolinones and glyphosate).
     In a preferred embodiment of the invention said vector is a bacterial artificial
    chromosome [BACS].

    According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a nucleic acid molecule
    comprising a transcription cassette wherein said cassette includes a nucleotide
    sequence designed with reference to a nucleotide sequence selected from the group:
    SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10, and is adapted for expression by provision of
10  at least one promoter operably linked to said nucleotide sequence such that both sense
    and antisense molecules are transcribed from said cassette.
     In a preferred embodiment of the invention said cassette is adapted such that both sense
    and antisense ribonucleic acid molecules are transcribed from said cassette wherein said
15  sense and antisense nucleic acid molecules are adapted to anneal over at least part or
    all of their length to form a inhibitory RNA or short hairpin RNA.
     In a preferred embodiment of the invention said cassette is provided with at least two
    promoters adapted to transcribe both sense and antisense strands of said ribonucleic
20  acid molecule.
     In an alternative preferred embodiment of the invention said cassette comprises a
    nucleic acid molecule wherein said molecule comprises a first part linked to a second
    part wherein said first and second parts are complementary over at least part of their
25  sequence and further wherein transcription of said nucleic acid molecule produces an
    ribonucleic acid molecule which forms a double stranded region by complementary base
    pairing of said first and second parts thereby forming an short hairpin RNA.
    A technique to specifically ablate gene function is through the introduction of double
30  stranded RNA, also referred to as small inhibitory/interfering RNA (siRNA) or short
    hairpin    RNA [shRNA], into        a cell which    results in the destruction of mRNA
    complementary to the sequence included in the siRNA/shRNA molecule.            The siRNA
    molecule comprises two complementary strands of RNA (a sense strand and an
    antisense strand) annealed to each other to form a double stranded RNA molecule. The
35  siRNA molecule is typically derived from exons of the gene which is to be ablated. The
    mechanism of RNA interference is being elucidated. Many organisms respond to the
    presence of double stranded RNA by activating a cascade that leads to the formation of
                                               11

    siRNA. The presence of double stranded RNA activates a protein complex comprising
    RNase Ill which processes the double stranded RNA into smaller fragments (siRNAs,
    approximately 21-29 nucleotides in length) which become part of a ribonucleoprotein
    complex. The siRNA acts as a guide for the RNase complex to cleave mRNA
 5  complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA thereby resulting in destruction of
    the mRNA.

     If microbial cells are used as organisms in the process according to the invention they
    are grown or cultured in the manner with which the skilled worker is familiar, depending
    on the host organism. As a rule, microorganisms are grown in a liquid medium
    comprising a carbon source, usually in the form of sugars, a nitrogen source, usually in
 5  the form of organic nitrogen sources such as yeast extract or salts such as ammonium
    sulfate, trace elements such as salts of iron, manganese and magnesium and, if
    appropriate, vitamins, at temperatures of between 00C and 1000C, preferably between
     100C and 600C, while gassing in oxygen.
    The pH of the liquid medium can either be kept constant, that is to say regulated during
10  the culturing period, or not. The cultures can be grown batchwise, semi-batchwise or
    continuously. Nutrients can be provided at the beginning of the fermentation or fed in
    semi-continuously or continuously. The methylated opiate alkaloids produced can be
    isolated from the organisms as described above by processes known to the skilled
    worker, for example by extraction, distillation, crystallization, if appropriate precipitation
15  with salt, and/or chromatography. To this end, the organisms can advantageously be
    disrupted beforehand. In this process, the pH value is advantageously kept between pH
    4 and 12, preferably between pH 6 and 9, especially preferably between pH 7 and 8.
    The culture medium to be used must suitably meet the requirements of the strains in
    question. Descriptions of culture media for various microorganisms can be found in the
20  textbook "Manual of Methods for General Bacteriology" of the American Society for
    Bacteriology (Washington D.C., USA, 1981).
    As described above, these media which can be employed in accordance with the
    invention usually comprise one or more carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inorganic
    salts, vitamins and/or trace elements.
25  Preferred carbon sources are sugars, such as mono-, di- or polysaccharides. Examples
    of carbon sources are glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, ribose, sorbose, ribulose,
    lactose, maltose, sucrose, raffinose, starch or cellulose. Sugars can also be added to the
    media via complex compounds such as molasses or other by-products from sugar
    refining. The addition of mixtures of a variety of carbon sources may also be
30  advantageous. Other possible carbon sources are oils and fats such as, for example,
    soya oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil and/or coconut fat, fatty acids such as, for example,
    palmitic acid, stearic acid and/or linoleic acid, alcohols and/or polyalcohols such as, for
    example, glycerol, methanol and/or ethanol, and/or organic acids such as, for example,
    acetic acid and/or lactic acid.

    Nitrogen sources are usually organic or inorganic nitrogen compounds or materials
    comprising these compounds. Examples of nitrogen sources comprise ammonia in liquid
    or gaseous form or ammonium salts such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride,
    ammonium phosphate, ammonium carbonate or ammonium nitrate, nitrates, urea, amino
 5  acids or complex nitrogen sources such as cornsteep liquor, soya meal, soya protein,
    yeast extract, meat extract and others. The nitrogen sources can be used individually or
    as a mixture.
     Inorganic salt compounds which may be present in the media comprise the chloride,
    phosphorus and sulfate salts of calcium, magnesium, sodium, cobalt, molybdenum,
10  potassium, manganese, zinc, copper and iron.
     Inorganic sulfur-containing compounds          such as, for example, sulfates,       sulfites,
    dithionites, tetrathionates, thiosulfates, sulfides, or else organic sulfur compounds such
    as mercaptans and thiols may be used as sources of sulfur for the production of sulfur
    containing fine chemicals, in particular of methionine.
15  Phosphoric acid, potassium dihydrogenphosphate or dipotassium hydrogenphosphate or
    the corresponding sodium-containing salts may be used as sources of phosphorus.
    Chelating agents may be added to the medium in order to keep the metal ions in
    solution. Particularly suitable chelating agents comprise dihydroxyphenols such as
    catechol or protocatechuate and organic acids such as citric acid.
20  The fermentation media used according to the invention for culturing microorganisms
    usually also comprise other growth factors such as vitamins or growth promoters, which
    include, for example, biotin, riboflavin, thiamine, folic acid, nicotinic acid, panthothenate
    and pyridoxine. Growth factors and salts are frequently derived from complex media
    components such as yeast extract, molasses, cornsteep liquor and the like. It is
25  moreover possible to add suitable precursors to the culture medium. The exact
    composition of the media compounds heavily depends on the particular experiment and
    is decided upon individually for each specific case. Information on the optimization of
    media can be found in the textbook "Applied Microbiol. Physiology, A Practical
    Approach" (Editors P.M. Rhodes, P.F. Stanbury, IRL Press (1997) pp. 53-73, ISBN 0 19
30  963577 3). Growth media can also be obtained from commercial suppliers, for example
    Standard 1 (Merck) or BHI (brain heart infusion, DIFCO) and the like.
    All media components are sterilized, either by heat (20 min at 1.5 bar and 121 0C) or by
    filter sterilization. The components may be sterilized either together or, if required,
                                              14

    separately. All media components may be present at the start of the cultivation or added
    continuously or batchwise, as desired.
    The culture temperature is normally between 150C and 450C, preferably at from 250C to
    400C, and may be kept constant or may be altered during the experiment. The pH of the
 5  medium should be in the range from 5 to 8.5, preferably around 7.0. The pH for
    cultivation can be controlled during cultivation by adding basic compounds such as
    sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia and aqueous ammonia or acidic
    compounds such as phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid. Foaming can be controlled by
    employing antifoams such as, for example, fatty acid polyglycol esters. To maintain the
10  stability of plasmids it is possible to add to the medium suitable substances having a
    selective effect, for example antibiotics. Aerobic conditions are maintained by introducing
    oxygen or oxygen-containing gas mixtures such as, for example, ambient air into the
    culture. The temperature of the culture is normally 200C to 450C and preferably 250C to
    400C. The culture is continued until formation of the desired product is at a maximum.
15  This aim is normally achieved within 10 to 160 hours.
    The fermentation broth can then be processed further. The biomass may, according to
    requirement, be removed completely or partially from the fermentation broth by
    separation methods such as, for example, centrifugation, filtration, decanting or a
    combination of these methods or be left completely in said broth. It is advantageous to
20  process the biomass after its separation.
    However, the fermentation broth can also be thickened or concentrated without
    separating the cells, using known methods such as, for example, with the aid of a rotary
    evaporator, thin-film evaporator, falling-film evaporator, by reverse osmosis or by
    nanofiltration. Finally, this concentrated fermentation broth can be processed to obtain
25  the opiate alkaloids present therein.

    encoded by a nucleic acid molecule as represented by the nucleic acid sequence in SEQ
     ID NO:    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10, or a nucleic acid molecule that hybridizes under
    stringent hybridization conditions to the nucleotide sequence in SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

    According to an aspect of the invention there is provided the use of a viral vector
    according to the invention in viral induced gene silencing in a P. somniferum plant.
    Virus induced gene silencing [VIGS] is known in the art and exploits a RNA mediated
30  antiviral defence mechanism. Plants that are infected with an unmodified virus induces a
    mechanism that specifically targets the viral genome. However, viral vectors which are
    engineered to include nucleic acid molecules derived from host plant genes also induce
    specific inhibition of viral vector expression and additionally target host mRNA.      This
    allows gene specific gene silencing without genetic modification of the plant genome and
35  is essentially a non-transgenic modification.

    Figure 1: Identification of genes exclusively present in the genome of a noscapine
    producing poppy variety, HN1 (High Noscapine 1). (A) Relative abundance of the major
    alkaloids extracted from the capsules of three commercial varieties of poppy, HM1 (High
    Morphine 1), HT1 (High Thebaine 1) and HN1. M = morphine, C = codeine, T = thebaine,
25  0 = oripavine and N = Noscapine. (B) EST libraries from stem and capsule were
    generated by pyrosequencing and unique contiguous sequences assembled as
    described in material and methods . Ten genes (PSMT1, PSMT2, PSMT3, CYP82X1,
     CYP82X2, CYP82Y1, CYP719A21, PSATI, PSSDR1 and PSCXE1) as defined in the
    text, were represented only in EST libraries from the HN1 variety. EST abundance of five
30  other functionally characterized P. somniferum genes (BBE, TNMT, SaIR, SaIAT and
    T6DM) show them to be expressed in all three varieties and at consistently higher levels
    in stem compared to capsule as is also the case for the HN1 specific genes as shown in
    colour code (Fig 1). PCR on genomic DNA from all three varieties revealed that the ten
    HN1 specific genes are absent from the genomes of the HM1 and HT1 varieties (Fig 5);

    and HM1 and the F1 generation. (B) The field grown F2 generation segregated into three
    classes of zero, low and high noscapine. F2 GC- and F2 GC+ indicate the absence and
    presence respectively of the noscapine gene cluster. Numbers in brackets indicate
 5  number of individuals in each class;
    Figure 3: The HN1 gene cluster. The structure and position of the ten HN1 specific genes
    expressed in stems and capsule tissues is shown above the central black line which
    represents 401 Kb of genomic sequence. Exons are represented by filled grey boxes and
10  introns by fine black lines. Arrows indicate the 5' to 3' orientation of each gene. Additional
    open reading frames depicted below the central black line are as defined by the key.
    None of these ORFs are represented in the stem and capsule EST libraries;

15  the HN1 gene cluster. Results from both leaf latex and capsules are consistent with each
    of these genes encoding enzymes involved in noscapine biosynthesis (A-F). All
    compounds that accumulate, apart from scoulerine, have been putatively identified on
    the basis of mass spectra as detailed in Fig. 6. The mass-to-charge (m/z) value (M)
    followed by retention time (T) in seconds is shown for each compound on the horizontal
20  axis. (G) Proposed pathway for noscapine biosynthesis based on VIGS data. Solid
    arrows depict steps supported by VIGS data, dotted arrows depict additional proposed
    steps. For the secoberbine intermediates, R1 = H or OH, R2 = H or OH and R3 =
    CH2OH or CHO or COOH (Fig. 6). The noscapine structure is numbered according to
    the IUPAC convention;

    panels show the mass spectra of the pseudomolecular parent ion at the chromatographic
35  peak apex in black and corresponding MS2 fragmentation spectra in red, scaled to

    mass spectra were obtained at a resolution setting of 7500. Text printed above selected
    diagnostic ions indicate the exact monoisotopic mass of the ion, the calculated formula
    within limits C=1:100, 0=0:200, N=0:3 and H=1:200, and the number/total number of
    formulae returned within a 5ppm error window. Fragments were reconciled against
 5  theoretical fragments generated by submitting candidate parent structures to Mass
    Frontier software (version 5.01.2; HighChem, Bratislava, Slovakia). Candidate parent
    structures were derived from PubChem searches and the comprehensive review of
    Papaver     spp.   alkaloids (Sariyar (2002)     Pure Appl. Chem. 74,         557-574).  (A)
    Tetrahydrocolumbamine; this compound was characterized from a peak eluting at 174s
10  from VIGS-silenced CYP719A21.          Eight out of ten observed MS2 fragments were
    calculated as feasible by Mass Frontier; only the two most abundant diagnostic
    fragments are shown. (B) Secoberbine intermediate 1 (C21H25NO6); this compound
    was characterized from a peak eluting at 147s from VIGS-silenced CYP82X2. If R1=OH,
    R2=H, and R3=CH2OH, then this compound is narcotolinol which is consistent with both
15  annotated fragments.         Another candidate formula fit would be demethoxylated
    narcotindiol (R1=H, R2=OH, R3=CH2OH); however this structure would not form the
    observed fragment at 206.0816. (C) Secoberbine intermediate 2 (C21H23NO6); this
    compound was characterized from a peak eluting at 103s from VIGS-silenced CYP82X2.
     If R1=OH , R2=H, and R3=CHO, then this compound would be                  a desmethylated
20  derivative of macrantaldehyde. (D) Papaveroxine; this compound was characterized from
    a peak eluting at 214s from VIGS-silenced PSCXE1. The 398.1600 fragment observed is
    consistent with deacetylation. (E) Narcotinehemiacetal; this compound was characterized
    from a peak eluting at 121s from VIGS-silenced PSSDR1.                  (F) Narcotoline (4'
    desmethylnoscapine); this compound was characterized from a peak eluting at 208s
25  from    VIGS-silenced      PSMT2.     Other    isobaric  possibilities   were   6-    or  7
    desmethylnoscapine. However, the 206.0816 fragment observed is consistent with a
    hydroxylated 4' position. Alternative structures could be discounted by comparing the
    candidate fragmentation spectra with that from synthetic 7-desmethylnoscapine, which
    eluted at a different retention time and lacked the characteristic 206.0816 fragment;

    Materials and Methods
    Plant Material Three GSK Australia poppy varieties that predominantly accumulate
    either noscapine (High Noscapine, HN1), morphine (High Morphine, HM1) or thebaine
 5  (High Thebaine HT1), were grown in Maxi (Fleet) RootrainerTM (Haxnicks, Mere, UK)
    under glass in 16 hour days at the University of York horticulture facilities. The growth
    substrate consisted of 4 parts John Innes No. 2, 1 part Perlite and 2 parts Vermiculite.
    The HM1 xHN1 F2 mapping population was grown at the GlaxoSmithKline Australia field
    trial site, Latrobe, Tasmania from September 2009 to February 2010.
10
    Crossing and selfing Crosses were carried out between HNand HM1 individuals to
    generate F1 hybrid seed. At the hook stage of inflorescence development, immature
    stamens were removed from selected HN1 flower buds. HN1 stigmas were fertilized with
    pollen from synchronously developing HM1 flowers shortly after onset of anthesis. To
15  prevent contaminating pollen from reaching the receptive stigmas, emasculated flowers
    were covered with a muslin bag for four days after pollination. Both the F1 and F2
    generations were self-pollinated to produce F2 and F3 seed, respectively. Self-pollination
    was ensured by covering the flowers shortly before onset of anthesis with a muslin bag.
20  RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis Upper stems (defined as the 2 cm section
    immediately underneath the capsule) and whole capsules were harvested at two
    developmental stages represented by 1-3 days and 4-6 days, after petal fall. Five plants
    were used per developmental stage and cultivar. The material was ground to a fine
    powder in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. RNA was isolated from the powder
25  using a CTAB-based extraction method (Chang et al (1993) Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 11,
     113-116)      with   small  modifications:   (i) three   sequential     extractions    with
    chloroform:isoamylalcohol (24:1) were performed and (ii) the RNA was precipitated
    overnight with lithium chloride at 40C. After spectrophotometric quantification, equal
    amounts of RNA were pooled from five plants per cultivar, development stage and organ.
30  The pooled samples underwent a final purification step using an RNeasy Plus MicroKit
    (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). RNA was typically eluted in 30-100 pl water.             cDNA was
    prepared with the SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit (Clontech, Saint-Germainen
    Laye, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions but using SuperScript ||
    Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen,      Paisley, UK ) for first strand synthesis. The
35  CDSIII/3'PCR primer was modified to: 5' ATT CTA GAT CCR ACA TGT TTT TTT TTT
    TTT TTT TTT TVN 3' where R = A or G, V = A, C or G; N = A/T or C/G. Following

    digestion with Mmel (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) the cDNA was finally purified
    using a QlAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK).
    cDNA Pyrosequencing: Pyrosequencing was performed on the Roche 454 GS-FLX
 5  sequencing platform (Branford, CT) using cDNA prepared from the following four
    samples of each of the three varieties:
         i. upper stem, 1-3 days after petal fall
       ii.  upper stem, 4 -6 days after petal fall
      iii.  capsule, 1-3 days after petal fall
10    iv.   capsule, 4 -6 days after petal fall
    Raw sequence analysis, contiguous sequence assembly and annotation The raw
    sequence datasets were derived from parallel tagged sequencing on the 454 sequencing
    platform (Meyer et al (2008) Nature Prot. 3, 267-78). Primer and tag sequences were first
15  removed from all individual sequence reads. Contiguous sequence assembly was only
    performed on sequences longer than 40 nucleotides and containing less than 3%
    unknown (N) residues. Those high quality Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequences
    were assembled into unique contiguous sequences with the CAP3 Sequence Assembly
    Program (Huang and Madan (1999) Genome Res. 9, 868-877), and the resulting contigs
20  were annotated locally using the BLAST2 program (Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids
    Res. 25, 3389-3402) against the non-redundant peptide database downloaded from the
    NCBI.
    Expression profiling: The number of ESTs associated with a specific consensus
25  sequence representing each of the candidate genes detailed in Figure 1 was counted for
    each EST library. EST numbers were normalised on the basis of total number of ESTs
    obtained per library. For each variety, EST counts were combined for the two
    developmental stages from both stems and capsules. Differences in candidate gene
    expression levels between organs and varieties were visualised as a heat map using
30  Microsoft Excel.
    Preparation of genomic DNA from glasshouse grown plants
     In order to amplify and obtain genomic sequences of the candidate genes 30-50 mgs of
35  leaf material was collected from 4-6 week old glasshouse-grown seedlings from each of
    the three varieties. Genomic DNA was extracted using the BioSprint 96 Plant kit on the
                                              29

 5  Primers for amplification and Sanger-sequencing of the candidate genes from genomic
    DNA were based on the respective contiguous sequences assembled from the ESTs or
    on BAC sequences. The primer sequences are shown in Table 3. PCR amplifications
    were performed on pools of genomic DNA comprising DNA from four individuals.
    Amplification was typically carried out on 10 ng genomic DNA in 1x Phusion High Fidelity
10  Buffer supplemented with 200 nM forward and reverse primers, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.02
    units/p] Phusion Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes, Vantaa, Finnland). Standard
    PCR conditions were used throughout with annealing temperatures and times dependent
    on primers and PCR equipment.
15  DNA extraction from the field-grown F2 mapping population
     40-50 mg of leaf tissue was harvested from F2 plants at the 'small rosette' growth stage
    (~10 leaves present on each plant) into 1.2 ml sample tubes. A 3 mm tungsten carbide
    bead was added to each tube and samples were kept at -800C for a minimum of two
    hours prior to freeze-drying for 18 hours. Following freeze drying, samples were
20  powdered by bead-milling (Model TissueLyser, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) at 30 Hz for
    two 60 s cycles separated by plate inversion. DNA extraction was performed with the
    Nucleospin Plant II kit (Macherey-Nagel, DOren, Germany) using the supplied Buffer Set
    PL2/3 following the manufacturer's protocol for centrifugal extraction. DNA was
    quantified by UV- spectroscopy.

    Genotyping of the HN1xHM1 F2 mapping population for the presence or absence
    of the HN1 -specific candidate genes
    Plants of the F2 mapping population were genotyped for the presence or absence of
    eight candidate genes. The gene primer pairs (Table 3) were designed with fluorescent
30  tags (5'-VIC*-labeled)    for use on      the ABI  3730xl capillary apparatus (Applied
    Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR amplifications were typically carried out on 10 ng
    genomic DNA in 1x GoTaq buffer supplemented with 1 mM MgCl 2, 500 nM forward and
    reverse primer, 0.125 mM dNTPs, 0.1 U GoTaq (Promega, Southampton, UK). The
    amplification conditions were: 1 min 94 0C, 30-36 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 0C, 30
35  s annealing at 62 0C and 20-50 s extension at 72 0C, followed by a final extension for 5
    min at 72 0 C. Cycle number and extension times depended on the candidate gene (Table
    3). Amplification products were diluted 1:20 in H2 0 and fractionated on an ABI 3730xl
                                             30

    GeneMarkerTM software (Softgenetics, State College, PA).
    Poppy straw analysis from field grown F2 plants
 5  Poppy capsules were harvested by hand from the mapping population once capsules
    had dried to approximately 10% moisture on the plant. After manually separating the
    seed from the capsule, the capsule straw samples (Poppy Straw) were then ground in a
    ball mill (Model MMO4, Retsch, Haan, Germany) into a fine powder. Samples of ground
    poppy straw were then weighed accurately to 2  0.003 g and extracted in 50 ml of a
10   10% acetic acid solution. The extraction suspension was shaken on an orbital shaker at
    200 rpm for a minimum of 10 min, then filtered to provide a clear filtrate. The final filtrate
    was passed through a 0.22 pm filter prior to analysis. The loss on drying (LOD) of the
    straw was determined by drying in an oven at 105 0 C for 3 hours.
15  All solutions were analysed using a Waters Acquity UPLC system (Waters Ltd., Elstree,
    UK). fitted with a Waters Acquity BEH C18 column, 2.1 mm        x 100 mm with 1.7 micron
    packing. The mobile phase used a gradient profile with eluent A consisting of 10 mM
    ammonium bicarbonate of pH 10.2 and eluent B methanol. The mobile phase gradient
    conditions used are as listed in the table below with a linear gradient. The flow rate was
20  0.5 ml per minute and the column maintained at 60 0 C. The injection volume was 2 I]and
    eluted peaks were ionised in positive APCI mode and detected within 5 ppm mass
    accuracy using a Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap. The runs were controlled by Thermo Xcalibur
    software (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Hemel Hempstead, UK).

    reduced using the CAMERA package (Kuhl et al (2012) Anal. Chem. 84, 283-289).
    Alkaloids were identified by comparing exact mass and retention time values to those of
 5  standards and quantified by their pseudomolecular ion areas using custom R scripts.
    Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) library construction
     The HN1 BAC library was constructed from high molecular weight (HMW) genomic DNA
    processed at Amplicon Express, Inc. (Pullman, WA) from four week old seedlings using
10  the method described (Tao et al (2002) Theor. Apple. Genet. 105, 1058-1066). The HMW
    DNA was partially digested with the restriction enzyme HindIll and size selected prior to
    ligation of fragments into the pCC1 BAC vector (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI)
    and transformation of DH10B E. coicells, which were then plated on Luria-Bertani (LB)
    agar with chloramphenicol, X-gal and IPTG at appropriate concentrations. Clones were
15  robotically picked with a Genetix QPIX (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) into 240 384
    well plates containing LB freezing media. Plates were incubated for 16 hours, replicated
    and then frozen at -80 0C. The replicated copy was used as a source plate for nylon filters
    that were made and used for screening using the PCR DIG Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche
    Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). To estimate insert sizes, DNA aliquots of 10 BAC
20  minipreps were digested with 5U of Notl enzyme for 3 hours at 37 0C. The digestion
    products were separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (CHEF-DRIll system, Bio
    Rad, Hercules, CA) in a 1% agarose gel in TBE. Insert sizes were compared to those of
    the Lambda Ladder MidRange              I PFG Marker (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,
    MA). Electrophoresis was carried out for 18 hours at 140 C with an initial switch time of 5
25  s, a final switch time of 15 s, in a voltage gradient of 6 V/cm. The average BAC clone
    size for the library was found to be 150 Kb.
    Filter construction and screening
    Filter design and screening was carried out at Amplicon Express, Inc. (Pullman, WA).
30  Bioassay dishes containing LB agar plate media and 12.5 pg/mL chloramphenicol were
    prepared. Positively charged nylon Amersham Hybond-N' membrane (GE Healthcare
    Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) was applied to the media surface and the GeneMachines
    G3 (Genomics Solutions, Bath, UK) was used to robotically grid 18,432 clones in
    duplicate on filters. The filters were incubated at 370C for 12 to 14 hours. The filters were
35  processed using the nylon filter lysis method (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning:          A
    Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY,
    2001, ed. 3, vol.1, chap. 1) with slight modifications. Following processing, the DNA was

    linked to the hybridization membrane filters according to the Hybond N+ manual by
    baking at 800C for 2 hours. To screen the library a 643 bp digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled
    probe representing position 2161-2803 in the genomic sequence of CYP82X2 (SEQ ID
    NO 6) was generated from 1.5 ng gDNA by PCR reaction using the primers shown in
 5  Table 3 and the PCR DIG synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN)
    according to the manufacturer's instructions. A non-labeled probe was amplified, diluted
    and spotted to each filter in the following dilutions of 2 ng, 1 ng, 0.1 ng and 0.0 ng as a
    positive control. The controls were baked at 800C for 30 min. Following a 30 min
    prehybridizing wash in DIG EasyHyb solution at 450C approximately 0.5 pl of denatured
10  DIG labeled PCR product was added per ml of hybridization solution with the nylon filters
    and incubated with gentle shaking overnight at 450C. The nylon filters were washed twice
    in a 2x standard sodium citrate (SSC), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer at
    room temperature for 5 min each, and twice with a 0.5x SSC, 0.1% SDS buffer at 650C
    for 15 minutes each. The hybridized probe was detected using NBT/BCIP stock solution
15  according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN)
    and was found to hybridize to six BAC clones.
    BAC sequencing and automated sequence assembly: The six positive BAC clones from
    the BAC library were sequenced at Amplicon Express, Inc. (Pullman, WA) by Focused
20  Genome Sequencing (FGS) with an average depth of 100x coverage. FGS is a Next
    Generation Sequencing (NGS) method developed at Amplicon Express that allows very
    high quality assembly of BAC clone sequence data using the Illumina HiSeq platform
    (Illumina,lnc, San Diego, CA). The proprietary FGS process makes NGS tagged libraries
    of BAC clones and generates a consensus sequence of the BAC clones with all reads
25  assembled at 80 bp overlap and 98% identity. The gapped contiguous sequences were
    ordered and orientated manually based on mate pair sequences from four libraries of
    insert size 5000, 2000, 500 and 170 bp. Overlapping BAC clones, PS_BAC193LO9,
    PSBAC179L19, PSBAC15OA23 and PSBAC164FO7, which together encoded all 10
    genes from the HN1 cluster, were selected for further sequence assembly. Where
30  possible, gaps and ambiguous regions on both BAC clones were covered by primer
    walking with traditional Sanger sequencing to validate the assembly. Combination of the
    four overlapping BAC sequences gave a single continuous consensus sequence
    assembly of 401 Kb. The sequences of the 10 genes from the HN1 cluster were
    determined independently by Sanger sequencing and the 100% agreement of the
35  Sanger determined gene sequences with the assembly from FGS provided quality
    assurance for the whole assembly.

    Annotation of the assembled sequence: The sequences of the four BAC clones were
    annotated with an automated gene prediction program          FGENESH (Salamov and
    Solovyev (2002) Genome Res. 10, 516-522). The gene structure including exon-intron
    arrangement for the 10 genes in the HN1 cluster was validated by comparison with
 5  cDNA sequence for each gene. cDNA sequence was not available for any of the
    remaining ORFs detailed in Fig. 3 since they are not represented in any of the EST
    libraries. The predicted function of all ORFs was evaluated by BLAST analysis (Altschul
    et al (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25, 3389-3402) and those ORFs with significant hits (e
    value less than 1e-8) were included in Fig.3.

    Generation of plasmid constructs for Virus Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS)
    The tobacco rattle virus (TRV) based gene silencing system (Liu et al (2002) Plant J. 30,
    415-422) was used to investigate the gene function of PSMT1, PSMT2, CYP719A21,
     CYP82X2, PSSDR1 and PSCXE1. DNA fragments selected for silencing were amplified
15  by PCR and cloned into the silencing vector pTRV2 (GenBank accession no: AF406991).
    They were linked to a 129 bp-long fragment (SEQ ID NO: 30) of the P. somniferum
    PHYTOENE DESATURASE             gene (PSPDS) in order to simultaneously silence the
    respective candidate genes and PSPDS.           Plants displaying the photo-bleaching
    phenotype resulting from PSPDS silencing (Hileman et al (2005) Plant J. 44, 334-341)
20  were identified as plants successfully infected with the respective silencing constructs
    and selected for further analysis.
    Generation of the pTRV2:PDS construct: A 622 bp fragment of PSPDS was amplified
    from cDNA prepared from HN1 using primers shown in Table 3. Sau3Al digestion of the
25  622 bp PCR product yielded among others a fragment of 129 bp (SEQ ID NO: 30) which
    was cloned into the BamHl site of the pTRV2 vector. The orientation and fidelity was
    confirmed by sequencing and the resulting pTRV2:PDS vector was used in the
    generation of the VIGS construct for each candidate gene. The pTRV2:PDS construct
    also served as the control in the VIGS experiments.
30
    DNA fragments selected for silencing the respective candidate genes were amplified
    from either HN1 genomic or cDNA. Primers used for amplification as well as the
    positions of the selected sequences within the respective open reading frames are
    shown in Table 3. The PSMT1, CYP719A21 and CYP82X2 fragments were first cloned
35  into pTVOO (Ratcliff et al (2001) Plant J., 237-245) using Hindlll and Kpnl and then
    subcloned into pTRV2:PDS using BamHl and Kpnl. PSMT2, PSCXE1 and PSSDR1

    fragments were cloned directly into pTRV2:PDS using BamHI and Kpnl. The orientation
    and fidelity of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing.
    Transformation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens with VIGS constructs: VIGS constructs
 5  were propagated in E. coli strain DH5a and transformed into electrocompetent
    Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain GV3101) by electroporation.
     Infiltration of plants: Separate overnight liquid cultures of A. tumefaciens containing
    individual VIGS constructs (each consisting of a selected DNA fragment from the target
10  gene linked to the 129 bp-long fragment from the P. somniferum                 PHYTOENE
    DESATURASE gene) were used to inoculate LB medium containing 10 mM MES, 20 pM
    acetosyringone and 50pg/ml kanamycin. Cultures were maintained at 28'C for 24 hours,
    harvested by centrifugation at 3000xg for 20 min, and resuspended in infiltration solution
    (10 mM MES, 200 pM acetosyringone, 10 mM MgCl2 ,) to an OD600 of 2.5. A. tumefaciens
15  harbouring the individual VIGS constructs including the control, pTRV2:PDS, were each
    mixed 1:1       (v/v) with A. tumefaciens containing pTRV1      (GenBank accession no:
    AF406990), and incubated for two hours at 220C prior to infiltration. Two week old
    seedlings of HN1 grown under standard greenhouse conditions (220C, 16h photoperiod),
    with emerging first leaves, were infiltrated as described (Hagel and Facchini (2010) Nat.
20  Chem. Biol. 6, 273-275).
    Latex and capsule analysis of silenced plants: Leaf latex of infiltrated plants displaying
    photo-bleaching as a visual marker for successful infection and silencing was analyzed
    when the first flower buds emerged (~7 week old plants). Latex was collected from cut
25  petioles, with a single drop dispersed into 500 pl of 10% acetic acid. This was diluted 1Ox
    in 1% acetic acid to give an alkaloid solution in 2% acetic acid for further analysis.
    Capsules were harvested from the same plants used for latex analysis and single
    capsules were ground to a fine powder in a ball mill (Model MM04, Retsch, Haan,
    Germany). Samples of ground poppy straw were then weighed accurately to 10 0.1 mg
30  and extracted in 0.5 ml of a 10% acetic acid solution with gentle shaking for 1h at room
    temperature. Samples were then clarified by centrifugation and a 50 p1 subsample diluted
     10x in 1% acetic acid to give an alkaloid solution in 2% acetic acid for further analysis.
    All solutions were analyzed as described for the poppy straw analysis from field grown
    F2 plants. Likewise, all data analysis was carried out using the R programming language.
35  Putative alkaloid peaks were quantified by their pseudomolecular ion areas using custom
    scripts. Peak lists were compiled and any peak-wise significant differences between
    samples were identified using 1-way ANOVA with p-values adjusted using the Bonferroni
                                              35

   WO 2013/136057                                                      PCT/GB2013/050599
    correction for the number of unique peaks in the data set. For any peak-wise
    comparisons with adjusted p-values < 0.05, Tukey's HSD test was used to identify peaks
    that were significantly different between any given sample and the control. Alkaloids
    were identified by comparing exact mass and retention time values to those of standards.
 5  Where standards were not available, the Bioconductor rcdk package (Smith et al (2006)
    Anal. Chem. 78, 779-787) was used to generate pseudomolecular formulae from exact
    masses within elemental constraints C = 1 100, H = 1 200, 0 = 0 200, N = 0 3 and mass
    accuracy < 5ppm. The hit with the lowest ppm error within these constraints was used to
    assign a putative formula.

    Example 1
    Transcriptomic analysis reveals the exclusive expression of 10 genes encoding
    five distinct enzyme classes in a high noscapine producing poppy variety, HN1.
15  These genes are absent from the genome of two noscapine non-producing
    varieties.
    Capsule extract from three opium poppy varieties developed in Tasmania for alkaloid
    production designated as High Morphine 1 (HM1), High Thebaine 1 (HT1) and High
    Noscapine 1 (HN1) on the basis of the most abundant alkaloid in each case (Fig. 1A)
20  underwent metabolite profiling. Noscapine was found to be unique to HN1 relative to
    HM1 and HT1. Roche 454 pyrosequencing was performed on cDNA libraries derived
    from stem and capsule tissue from all three varieties. Analysis of Expressed Sequence
    Tag (EST) abundance led to the discovery of a number of previously uncharacterized
    genes that are expressed in the HN1 variety but are completely absent from the HM1
25  and HT1 EST libraries (Fig. 1B). The corresponding genes were putatively identified as
    three O-methyltransferases       (PSMT1,    PSMT2,   PSMT3),    four cytochrome     P450s
    (CYP82X1, CYP82X2, CYP82X3 and CYP719A21), an acetyltransferase (PSATi), a
    carboxylesterase (PSCXE1) and a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (PSSDR1). In
    contrast a    number     of other functionally   characterized   genes    associated with
30  benzylisoquinoline alkaloid synthesis, including Berberine Bridge Enzyme (BBE),
     Tetrahydroprotoberberine    cis-N-MethylTransferase (TNMT),      Salutaridine Reductase
    (SaIR), Salutaridinol 7-0-AcetylTransferase (SaAT) and Thebaine 6-0-demethylase
    (T60DM) were expressed in all three varieties (Fig. 1B). PCR analysis on genomic DNA
    from all three varieties revealed that the genes exclusively expressed in the HN1 variety
35  are present as expected in the genome of HN1 but absent from the genomes of the HM1
    and HT1 varieties (Fig.1B and Fig. 5).

   WO 2013/136057                                                         PCT/GB2013/050599
    Example 2
    Analysis of an F2 mapping population shows the genes are tightly linked in HN1
    and their presence is associated with the production of noscapine.
    An F2 mapping population of 271 individuals was generated using HN1 and HM1 as
 5  parents. Genotyping of the field grown F2 population revealed that the HN1 specific
    genes are tightly linked and associated with the presence of noscapine suggesting they
    occur as a gene cluster involved in noscapine biosynthesis (Fig. 2B). Analysis of
    noscapine levels in field grown F2 capsules revealed that individuals containing this
    putative gene cluster fall into two classes. The first class containing 150 individuals, have
10  relatively low levels of noscapine and the second class containing 63 individuals exhibit
    the high noscapine trait of the parental HN1 variety (Fig. 2B). The 58 F2 individuals that
    lack the putative gene cluster contain undetectable levels of noscapine (Fig. 2B). F3
    family analysis confirmed that F2 individuals exhibiting the high noscapine trait were
    homozygous for the gene cluster while those exhibiting the low noscapine trait were
15  heterozygous (Table 2). Noscapine levels in both the F1 population (Fig. 2A) and the
    heterozygous F2 class are much lower than the intermediate levels expected for a semi
    dominant trait, suggesting involvement of some form of repression. The step change to
    high noscapine in homozygous F2 class suggests this trait is linked to the gene cluster
    locus rather than spread quantitatively among other loci.
20
    Example 3
    Bacterial artificial chromosome sequencing confirms that the 10 genes exist as a
    complex gene cluster
    To further characterize the putative noscapine gene cluster, a Bacterial Artificial
25  Chromosome (BAC) library was prepared from genomic DNA isolated from HN1
    and six overlapping BACs containing genes from the cluster were identified. Next
    generation and Sanger sequencing was used to generate a high quality assembly of 401
    Kb confirming the arrangement of the 10 genes in a cluster spanning 221 Kb (Fig 3).
    Only one other homologous gene, a carboxylesterase (PSCXE2),              was found in the
30  genomic sequence flanking the gene cluster (Fig 3) but PSCXE2 was not represented in
    any of our EST libraries. Interspersed among the ten genes are both retrotransposon and
    DNA transposable element (TE) sequences (Fig 3), which may have some function in
    gene rearrangement for cluster formation as thought to be the case for the thalianol and
    marneral clusters from A. thaliana (Field et al (2011) PNAS 108, 16116-16121).

    Example 4
    Virus induced gene silencing results in accumulation of pathway intermediates
    allowing gene function to be linked to noscapine synthesis and a novel bifurcated
    biosynthetic pathway to be proposed
 5   In order to functionally characterize the genes in the HN1 cluster Virus Induced Gene
    Silencing (VIGS) was performed on poppy seedlings. VIGS in poppy seedlings persists
    through to mature plant stages (Hileman et al (2005) Plant J. 44, 334-341), and therefore
    both leaf latex and capsule extracts were routinely assayed (Fig. 4). Silencing PSMT1
    resulted in accumulation of scoulerine in capsules and also low levels of reticuline in
10  latex, indicating that this gene product is responsible for the first committed step in the
    pathway to noscapine synthesis (Fig 4A). The predicted product of PSMT1                   is
    tetrahydrocolumbamine (Fig. 6), which accumulated in seedlings and capsules that were
    silenced for CYP719A21 (Fig 4B). CYP719A21 shows high homology to cytochrome
    P450 oxidases that act as methylenedioxy bridge-forming enzymes (Dfaz Chdvez et al
15  (2011) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 507, 186193; Ikezawa et al (2009) Plant Cell Rep. 28,
     123-133). Therefore CYP719A21 may encode a canadine synthase.Fig. 6). Silencing of
    a second cytochrome P450 gene, CYP82X2, resulted in accumulation of several
    secoberbine intermediates some of which may represent side products to the main
    synthetic pathway (Fig. 4C, Fig. 6). Silencing of the carboxylesterase gene PSCXE1
20  resulted in accumulation of up to 20% total alkaloid content of putative papaveroxine
    (Fig. 6) implying acetylation of a secoberbine intermediate as depicted in Fig. 4G. The
    PSATI gene from the HN1 cluster is an obvious candidate for this reaction. Silencing of
    PSSDR1       resulted    in  accumulation    of  what    was    putatively   identified  as
    narcotinehemiacetal (Fig. 6), an immediate precursor of noscapine (Fig 4G). These data
25  support a biosynthetic route to noscapine that involves early O-methylation of a
    secoberbine intermediate at the position equivalent to the C4' hydroxyl group of
    noscapine (Fig. 4G). However, silencing PSMT2, resulted in accumulation of up to 20%
    narcotoline, indicating that 0-methylation at the C4' hydroxyl group can also occur as a
    final step in noscapine production (Fig. 4F). These results imply bifurcation of the main
30  pathway at the secoberbine intermediate stage with PSMT2 being responsible for both
    the O-methylation of a secoberbine intermediate and narcotoline. Silencing PSMT2
    results in accumulation of high levels of narcotoline as flux is directed down the
    desmethyl branch of the pathway (Fig. 4F).
