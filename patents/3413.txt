Abstract
The invention provides a window chain winder assembly for selectively limiting the
extent of opening of a window, the winder assembly having a housing (8); a chain
(2) contained within the housing to be partially extended therefrom, the chain being
attached at its distal end to a moveable portion of a window frame assembly. An
actuator (3) on the outside of the housing is operable for activating a rotatable drive
gear (9) to drive the chain into and out of the housing, and a restrictor mechanism
(4), which is accessible from outside the housing (8) and which is attached to a
stopper (16) within the housing (8), is positionable in an active state to restrict chain
length beyond the housing. Rotation of the actuator (3) drives the chain (2) out of
the housing to the extent permitted until the stopper (16) inhibits further movement,
thereby restricting the opening distance of the attached window frame.

Field of the Invention
 [01]       This invention relates to a window chain winder that functions to restrict
 the extent of opening of a hinged window assembly. More specifically it relates to
 a window chain winder that provides a convenient mechanism to restrict the length
 of chain permitted to be extended from the winder body and thereby restrict the
 window opening distance of the window frame to which the assembly is attached.
 Winders of this type are typically installed on awning windows. Without limiting its
 application beyond its use on awning windows, the invention will herein be
 described in terms of a chain winder that is capable in use of limiting the extent of
 opening of windows, thereby to improve safety.
Background to the Invention
 [02]       Window winders typically include a body which houses a stiff chain,
 being one that remains generally in a single plane and which is able to extend out
 of an opening in the body. The distal end of the chain is attached to the moveable
 part of the window assembly, which may open inwards, but is usually configured to
 open outwardly. When activated, either manually or mechanically, the winder
 causes a length of the chain to be extended from the body, in doing so pushing the
 moveable part of the hinged window frame, into an open position.
 [03]       To improve safety around openable windows, it is desirable to limit the
 opening distance to prevent accidental falls from heights, while still allowing the
 flow of fresh air and light into the premises. Although an increasing proportion of
 families now occupy multi-storey dwellings, not all multi-storey dwellings are
 occupied by children or others who may be at an elevated risk of falling from height.
 There is a benefit to lower risk residents being able to open a window to its full
 extent.
 [04]       A problem with existing chain winders that function to restrict the opening
 distance of a window is that the maximum length by which the chain may extend
 from the winder body and therefore dictate the opening distance of the window,

                                             2
must be set on the base plate of the body prior to installation. Once set, opening
distance cannot be varied without significant effort in unscrewing and removing the
entire winder from its installed position on the window. This is an impractical and
time-consuming task for residents who do not have the necessary tools or
adequate know-how to alter the window opening distance by making the necessary
adjustment. It would therefore be desirable to provide a window winder that allows
a user flexibility to lock the winder in a restricted position or to allow the winder to
open the window to its full extent, depending on the individual circumstances of
that user.
[05]       A further problem when considering the safety issue of people falling
from heights is that a locking mechanism that must be locked in the restricted
position each time the window is opened, presents a risk that a child or other person
may open the window beyond that restricted position because they are unaware of
the means for locking, and/or are unable to lock, the window lock in the safe,
restricted position.
[06]       There is discerned a need for a lockable and restrictable winder to
operate such that, once locked in a restricting state, the chain may be fully retracted
into the housing (barring the means by which it is connected to the window) to allow
the window to be moved to the closed position, but not be extensible beyond its
restricted length when opened. This would provide additional security and safety
by preventing a window being inadvertently left in the unlocked and unrestricted
position while still maintaining the ability to open the window to the restricted
position to allow the passage of light and air.

Summary of the Invention
 [08]       The invention disclosed herein provides for a window winder assembly
 including:
             a housing and a removable base attached thereto, together defining a
             body having an internal space within;
             a chain, containable within the housing and having a distal end
             attached to a bracket, the bracket being securable in use to a
             moveable portion of a window frame;
             an actuator, operable by means of a handle operably located external
             to the housing, and comprising a drive gear operatively mounted within
             the housing, such that, when the bracket is operatively secured to a
             moveable window frame portion, the drive gear,
                   when rotated about its axis in a first direction, engages with the
                   chain to drive a length of the chain to an extended position
                   external to the housing, so that the moveable window frame
                   portion is driven to an open position relative to the fixed window
                   frame; and
                   when rotated in a second, opposite direction, the chain length is
                   withdrawn into the housing, so that the moveable window frame
                   portion is moved to a closed position relative to the fixed window
                   frame;
             a chain travel-restrictor mechanism operatively mounted within the
             housing and user-accessible through an aperture in an upper external
             surface of the housing, the restrictor mechanism comprising a movable
             stopper and a stopper-locking device,
             the stopper being movable, by operation of the stopper locking device,
             from an active position, in which passage of the chain is obstructed and

                                             4
             the length of chain extending from the housing is restricted, to an
             inactive position, in which the passage of the chain is not obstructed,
             so that it is permitted to bypass the stopper and extend from the housing
             to its full extent.
[09]       In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the housing comprises a
fixing post to which the chain, at its proximal end, is permanently secured.
[010]      According to a preferred form of the invention, the housing comprises an
axle secured therein, to which the drive gear is operatively connected, for activation
by rotation of the actuator, whereby to drive the chain to extend from or be retracted
within the housing.
[011]      According to a further preferred form of the invention, the window winder
assembly includes an idler gear having multiple teeth for engaging with the chain
and operably arranged to travel in a substantially linear path within the housing,
being rotated about its axis by movement of the chain within the housing. The
chain moves in an arcuate path defined by the location of the idler gear and internal
wall of the housing.
[012]      In a still further preferred form of the invention, when the stopper is in
active position, is orientated to block travel of the idler gear through the housing
such that further extension of the chain out of the housing is prevented and the
opening distance of the attached window is restricted.
[013]       According to a further preferred form of the invention, the restrictor
mechanism comprises a key-operable locking barrel.
[014]      Preferably, the locking barrel extends to an upper outer surface of the
housing, to be accessible from beyond said surface for insertion of a key. The
locking barrel may comprise a wafer cylinder for operation by insertion of a key
therein.
[015]      Preferably the stopper is connected to the locking barrel to be rotatable
with said barrel by key operation, thereby to be positioned in active or inactive

                                              5
orientation. When the stopper is in inactive state, the idler gear can bypass the
stopper, so that the chain can be extended from the housing to its full extent.
[016]       In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the housing contains a jamb
portion fixed to it within, the jamb portion being located to define a limit to which the
idler gear can travel as a result of travel of the chain when extended from the
housing.
[017]       In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the idler gear, when
at the limit of its travel with the chain having been extended from the housing, rests
substantially directly above the stopper, thereby to prevent the stopper being
rotated into a position between the idler gear and the jamb portion and to allow
subsequent rotation of the drive means in the opposing direction only, thereby next
to ensure at least partial withdrawal of the chain into the housing, and drawing of
the attached window towards its closed position.
[018]       According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a
method of restricting a window opening, the method comprising the steps of
providing a window frame assembly having an openable movable portion hingedly
connected to a fixed frame portion; attaching a chain winder assembly to the fixed
frame portion,       the assembly comprising a chain-receiving housing, a winder
actuator and a restrictor device; attaching a first distal end of a chain to the
moveable portion, and a second, proximal end of the chain to the housing so that
a length of chain extends from housing to the moveable frame portion; operating
the actuator to adjust said length of chain, and operating the restrictor device to
limit the length of chain that the actuator may cause to be released from the
housing; thereby to limit displacement of the moveable frame portion from the fixed
portion.
[019]       Further, according to this aspect, the restrictor device is operable to
locate a blocking member to prevent movement of an idler gear engaged with the
chain within the housing.

                                            6
 [020]       In a preferred form of the invention, the method includes the step of
 locking the blocking member in active, movement-preventing orientation.
 [021]       Preferably, the method comprises the step of preventing locking of the
 blocking member when the chain length has been adjusted to its maximum.
 [022]       The locking mechanism may include a barrel lock attached to the
 blocking member for causing displacement thereof between an inactive and an
 active, blocking orientation.

Detailed Description of Embodiments of the Invention
 [024]       The window chain winder assembly of this invention has been configured
 such that the restrictor operating mechanism is positioned to be accessed from the
 upper outside surface of the winder housing, allowing a user or operator to

                                           7
alternate conveniently between the restricted window opening distance and the
fully opened distance.
[025]      With reference to Figure 1, the winder 100 of the present invention is
comprised of a body 1, a flexible chain 2, an actuator 3 and a restrictor mechanism
4.   Body 1 is secured to the fixed portion 42 of a window frame assembly with
securing fasteners (not shown) inserted through openings 6. The distal end of the
chain is attached to the moveable portion 44 of the window frame assembly by a
bracket 5 and screw fasteners 26 of conventional design. Moveable frame portion
44 includes a window pane and is pivotally attached to fixed frame portion 42 by
means of hinges (not shown). The fixed frame portion is secured to the wall in
which the window is located.
[026]      Actuator 3, to be described below, protrudes from body 1 and provides
a rotatable handle for grasping by an operator of the winder device. It is operatively
connected to a winding mechanism housed within the body.
[027]      Body 1 has an internal space within it, enclosed by a housing 8 and an
attachable base plate 7. The base plate has four openings 10, each for use in
securing the base plate to the housing by means of a securing fastener 11. The
securing fasteners illustrated are shown as fixing screws, but other types of
securing fasteners are contemplated without departing from the scope of the
invention.
[028]      Figure 2 provides an exploded view of the winder and internal
components thereof. Actuation of actuator 3, by a human operator or user rotating
the handle, drives a rotatable drive gear 9 within body 1 to engage with sprockets
of chain 2, thereby causing the a length of the chain to extend from or be retracted
into the body, The length of chain extended in turn alters the opening distance of
the attached window portion 44 from fixed portion 42.
[029]      A restrictor mechanism 4, installed within the body but accessible
externally via an aperture in the upper outer surface of the housing of body 1,
comprises a stopper 16 contained within the body. The stopper is rotatably

                                             8
connected to be moveable with the restrictor mechanism from an inactive to an
active orientation within the housing and chain.
[030]      When in an active position, the stopper restricts the length of chain 2 that
may be wound out from the body by operating actuator 3.               The limitation of
extensible length thereby restricts the opening distance of the attached window.
When in its inactive position, the stopper is removed from inhibiting chain
movement. This allows the operator of the actuator to wind the chain out from the
body to its full extent, in turn allowing the window to open to its full extent.
[031]       The drive means for the chain, which includes drive gear 9 and a worm
gear 12, operatively engageable therewith, is activated by rotation of the handle of
actuator 3, situated external to housing 8. Here actuator 3 is shown as a handle to
be rotated manually, but other means of actuation, including automated means,
are also to be considered as falling within the scope of the invention.
[032]      Actuator 3 is attached integrally to worm gear 12 by means of a retaining
clip 13. Rotating actuator 3 rotates the worm gear, which in turn drives drive gear
9 in a rotating motion in a plane coinciding with a plane occupied by chain 2, so
that teeth protruding from drive gear 9 actively engage chain 2, to drive it into or
out of housing 8, thereby altering its external exposed length, and adjusting the
opening distance of attached movable window frame portion 44 (see Figure 1). An
aperture 17 at the proximal end of the chain 2 is inserted over a fixing post 18 to
permanently secure the proximal end of the chain to the housing 8, so that rotation
of drive gear 9 will cause rotation of an idler gear 14 along a linear, longitudinal
path through the interior of the body, guiding and maintaining the position of the
chain 2 with the help of guiderails 28. A portion of the chain is always retained
within the housing, extending from post 18, around idler gear 14 and drive gear 9
before exiting through portal 24.
[033]      Figure 2 illustrates further detail of restrictor mechanism 4. The restrictor
mechanism passes through the upper external surface of housing 8 to provide a
convenient means for altering the maximum openable distance of the window,
either from the restricted open position at which the stopper 16 is in the active state,

                                            9
or to a fully open position at which stopper 16 is in the inactive state. "Active" is the
position in which stopper 16 restricts chain travel by preventing rotation of idler gear
14 and consequently its travel relative to the chain. "Inactive" is the position in
which the stopper does not impede movement of the idler gear and therefore does
not restrict chain travel to its maximum paid-out length.
[034]       The restrictor mechanism consists of a lock barrel 21 secured to stopper
16 by means of a washer 19 and a fastener, shown here as a screw 20. The
restrictor mechanism is operated by insertion into and rotation of a key 15 in the
lock barrel. Rotating the key rotates with it the attached stopper, though an arc of
900, from the active state (see Figure 3) to the inactive state (see Figure 4).
[035]       Visual and written cues to aid easy identification of restricted (locked)
versus unrestricted position are provided on the exterior of housing 8, adjacent the
keyhole 30. When the key is in the horizontal position, the restrictor mechanism is
in the inactive, unrestricted position. Rotation of the key 900 anticlockwise in the
direction of the arrow shown on the housing 8 to a generally vertical plane of
orientation, indicates that restrictor mechanism 4 is in the active, restricted (or
locked) state.
[036]       It should be appreciated that the restrictor mechanism is not limited to
the form or position in the housing described herein. Other means of restrictor
mechanism, including electromechanical and automated means and/or with or
without key operation are also considered to be within the scope hereof.
[037]       Figure 3 shows the internal components of housing 8 by virtue of base
plate 7 having been removed for convenience of explanation. Stopper 16 is in its
active, blocking orientation. Insertion and rotation of key 15 in locking barrel 21
anticlockwise by 900, has rotated stopper 16 900 into active position, such that
stopper 16 sits generally perpendicular to base plate 7 (when fitted). This is shown
in the callout circle of Figure 3. When in this active position, stopper 16 acts to limit
the length of chain 2 that can extend from housing 8.

                                             10
[038]       In active restricting (or stopping) position, stopper 16 blocks further travel
of the distal end of the chain 2 out of body 1.
[039]       Operation of the handle of actuator 3, as outlined above, rotates drive
gear 9, causing it to engage chain 2. Further rotation then causes the chain to be
pushed or pulled according to direction of handle rotation.           Clockwise rotation
draws the chain into the housing and anticlockwise rotation expels it gradually.
Whichever links of the chain are at any moment engaged with idler gear 14 cause
it to rotate about its axis and, driven by the chain, to move along a linear path in
the housing, in the plane occupied by the chain, which plane it parallel to the base
plate. Idler gear 14 serves to guide chain 2 through the housing 8 towards the
expulsion aperture or, alternatively, further inward.
[040]       Continuing rotation of actuator 3 will continue to drive the chain out of
the housing until idler gear 14 engages with stopper 16, provided the latter is in its
downwardly-depending, path-blocking orientation. At this point, rotation of the idler
gear about its axis is inhibited and further rotation of actuator 3 is prevented. Chain
2 cannot then be driven further out of housing 8 and the opening distance of the
attached window is thereby restricted.
[041]       Rotation of actuator 3 in the opposite, clockwise direction rotates drive
gear 9 in the opposing direction to draw chain 2 into the housing and thereby pull
the attached window to its closed position. This design feature provides the added
convenience and safety benefit of allowing the window to be opened between the
safe restricted position and the closed position without having to lock and unlock
the restrictor mechanism.
[042]       Figure 4 shows stopper 16 in the inactive state. When in this unrestricted
position, the stopper is positioned with its arresting arm in a generally parallel and
longitudinally aligned position relative to base plate 7, as shown in the callout.
Rotation of actuator 3 causes drive gear 9 to engage chain 2 to drive the chain
progressively out of the housing. With stopper 16 in its inactive position, idler gear
14, rotated and drawn along by chain 2, pass over stopper 16 without progress
impeding contact occurring between the idler gear and the stopper. Continuing

                                            11
rotation of actuator 3 will drive chain 2 out of housing 8 to its full available extent
until idler gear 14 comes into abutment with jamb 22, which is fixed to housing 8.
This position defines the furthermost point idler 14 can travel along its path, as
shown in Figure 5 and the greatest extent to which chain 2 can be expelled.
[043]       Figure 5 further demonstrates that when chain 2 is at maximum
permitted expulsion length, idler gear 14 rests adjacent the jamb and directly above
the stopper, such that rotation of key 15 in locking barrel 21 will be impeded by
reason of idler gear preventing rotation of stopper 16. From this configuration,
rotation of actuator 3 is possible in one direction only, being the direction that draws
chain 2 back into housing 8, thereby pulling the attached window to the closed
position.
[044]       It will be appreciated that the embodiment and variations described
herein illustrate selected examples of the method, kit and apparatus of the
invention providing for the selected limiting of the extent to which a hinged window
may be opened. With the insight gained from this disclosure, the person skilled in
the art is well placed to discern further embodiments by means of which to put the
claimed invention into practice.

     to its full extent.
2. A window winder assembly according to claim 1, wherein the housing
   comprises a fixing post to which the chain, at its proximal end, is
   permanently secured.
3. A window winder assembly according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the
   housing comprises an axle secured therein, to which the drive gear is
   operatively connected, for activation by rotation of the actuator,
   whereby to drive the chain to extend from or be retracted within the
   housing
4. A window winder assembly according to any one of the preceding
   claims further including an idler gear having multiple teeth for engaging
   with the chain and operably arranged to travel in a substantially linear
   path within the housing, being rotated about its axis by movement of
   the chain within the housing.
5. A window winder assembly according to claim 4 wherein the stopper,
   when in active position, is orientated to block travel of the idler gear
   through the housing such that further extension of the chain out of the
   housing is prevented and the opening distance of the attached window
   is restricted.
6. A window winder assembly according to any one of the preceding
   claims, wherein the travel-restrictor mechanism comprises a key
   operable locking barrel.

                                          14
7.        A window winder assembly according to claim 6, wherein the locking
          barrel comprises a wafer cylinder for operation by insertion of a key
         therein.
8.       A window winder assembly according to claim 6 or claim 7, wherein the
         stopper is connected to the locking barrel to be rotatable with said barrel
          by key operation, thereby to be positioned in active or inactive
         orientation.
9.       A window winder assembly according to claim 8, wherein the stopper,
         when in inactive orientation, the idler gear can bypass the stopper, so
         that the chain can be extended from the housing to its full extent.
10.      A window winder assembly according to claim 9, wherein the housing
         contains a jamb portion fixed to it within, the jamb portion being located
         to define a limit to which the idler gear can travel as a result of travel of
         the chain when extended from the housing.
11.       A window winder assembly according claim 10, wherein the idler gear,
    when at the limit of its travel with the chain having been extended from the
    housing, rests substantially directly above the stopper, thereby to prevent
    the stopper being rotated into a position between the idler gear and the jamb
    portion and to allow subsequent rotation of the drive means in the opposing
    direction only, thereby next to ensure at least partial withdrawal of the chain
    into the housing, and drawing of the attached window towards its closed
    position.
12.       A method of restricting a window opening, the method comprising the
    steps of:
            a providing a window frame assembly having an openable movable
                portion hingedly connected to a fixed frame portion;

                                          15
            b attaching a chain winder assembly to the fixed frame portion, the
               assembly comprising a chain-receiving housing, a winder actuator
               and a restrictor device;
            c  attaching a first distal end of a chain to the moveable portion, and
               a second, proximal end of the chain to the housing so that a length
               of chain extends from housing to the moveable frame portion;
           d operating the actuator to adjust said length of chain, and
           e   operating the restrictor device to limit the length of chain that the
               actuator can cause to be released from the housing;
           thereby to limit displacement of the moveable frame portion from the
           fixed portion.
13.       The method of claim 12 wherein the restrictor device is operable to
    locate a blocking member to prevent movement of an idler gear engaged
    with the chain within the housing.
14.       The method of claim 13 including the step of locking the blocking
    member in active, movement-preventing orientation.
15.       The method of claim 14 including the step of preventing locking of the
    blocking member when the chain length has been adjusted to its maximum.
16.       The method of claim 14 or claim 15 wherein the locking mechanism
    comprises a barrel lock attached to the blocking member for causing
    displacement thereof between an            inactive and an     active, blocking
    orientation.
