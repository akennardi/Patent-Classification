                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
       [0001]     The present invention relates to a hybrid vehicle.
2. Description of Related Art
       [0002]     Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 10-339185 (JP 10-339185 A)
discloses a front-engine front-wheel drive (FF) hybrid vehicle including an engine, a rotating
machine, a transaxle, drive shafts, driving wheels, and the like.    A damper, a torque converter,
a transmission mechanism, a differential, and the like are provided in a case of the transaxle,
and the damper and the torque converter are placed on the same axis as an output shaft of the
engine.    Further, the transmission mechanism is placed such that the output shaft of the
engine and an input shaft of the transmission mechanism are placed on the same axis, but the
output shaft of the engine and an output shaft of the transmission mechanism are placed on
different axes.    The rotating machine is placed outside the case of the transaxle on an axis
different from the output shaft of the engine, and is configured such that a power output from
the output shaft of the engine and a power output from an output shaft of the rotating machine
are transmittable to the driving wheels.
                               SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
       [0003]     The hybrid vehicle described in JP 10-339185 A separately requires an
exclusive cooling device configured to cool the rotating machine that generates heat by
operating, which causes a problem to cause upsizing of the hybrid vehicle correspondingly.
       [0004]     The present invention provides a hybrid vehicle that can achieve downsizing
and cool a rotating machine.
       [0005]     As an exemplary aspect of the present invention is a hybrid vehicle.       The

                                                2
hybrid vehicle includes: an engine including an output shaft configured to output a power; a
damper placed on a first axis that is the same axis as the output shaft; a rotating machine
placed on the first axis; a torque converter placed on the first axis; a transmission mechanism
placed so that an input shaft of the transmission mechanism is positioned on a second axis that
is an axis different from the first axis; a case in which the rotating machine and the
transmission mechanism are accommodated; drive shafts; driving wheels attached to the drive
shafts; and an oil accumulated in a lower part of a space surrounded by the case and used for
lubrication of the transmission mechanism, the oil being in contact with a part of the rotating
machine.
       [0006]     Further, in the above invention, the torque converter may include a lock-up
clutch, and the damper, the rotating machine, and the torque converter may be placed in this
order from an engine side so that a power of the engine is transmitted to the damper, the
rotating machine, and the torque converter in this order.
       [0007]     As such, in the hybrid vehicle of the present invention, the rotating machine
is placed on the engine side relative to the torque converter.      Accordingly, even if such a
defect occurs that the torque converter cannot be locked up by the lock-up clutch, the engine
can be started by a power of the rotating machine.
       [0008]     Further, in the above invention, the hybrid vehicle may further include a
differential connected to the drive shafts and accommodated in the case.          The differential
may include a differential ring gear and the differential ring gear may be placed in the case
such that a part of the rotating machine and a part of the differential ring gear overlap with
each other when viewed from an axial direction of the first axis and the differential ring gear
partially are in contacted with the oil.
       [0009]     Hereby, in the hybrid vehicle of the present invention, a distance between the
rotating machine and the differential ring gear can be made closer in a radial direction of the
differential ring gear, so that an oil scooped up by the differential ring gear can be easily

                                                 3
poured over the rotating machine, thereby making it possible to improve coolability of the
rotating machine.
       [0010]     Further, in the above invention, the hybrid vehicle may further include a
differential connected to the drive shafts and accommodated in the case.          The differential
may include a differential ring gear, and the rotating machine and the differential ring gear
may be placed in the case such that the rotating machine is positioned on an extension line of
the differential ring gear in a radial direction and the differential ring gear partially contacts
with the oil.
       [0011]     Hereby, in the hybrid vehicle of the present invention, the oil scooped up by
the differential ring gear is easily poured over the rotating machine, thereby making it
possible to improve coolability of the rotating machine.
       [0012]     Further, in the above invention, the hybrid vehicle may further include a
clutch configured to interrupt a power transmission between the engine and the rotating
machine.      The clutch may be provided in an inside-diameter side of a rotor included in the
rotating machine.
       [0013]     As such, in the hybrid vehicle of the present invention, the clutch is placed on
the inside-diameter side of the rotor included in the rotating machine, thereby making it
possible to shorten a length of the transaxle in the axial direction in comparison with a case
where the rotating machine and the clutch are serially placed side by side in the axial direction
of the output shaft of the engine.
       [0014]     Further, the hybrid vehicle may further include, in the above invention, a
clutch configured to interrupt a power transmission between the engine and the rotating
machine.      The clutch may be provided in a first power transmission path between the engine
and the rotating machine; and a second power transmission path between the rotating machine
and the driving wheels may be connected when the clutch interrupts the first power

                                                 4
transmission path.
       [0015]     As such, in the hybrid vehicle of the present invention, even if the clutch
interrupts the power transmission between the engine and the rotating machine, the power
transmission path between the rotating machine and the driving wheels is connected, so that
an electric power can be generated by regeneration of the rotating machine by a rotational
force from a driving-wheel side.
       [0016]     In the hybrid vehicle of the present invention, the rotating machine is
accommodated in the same case as the damper, the torque converter, and the transmission
mechanism, and a space where an oil accumulated in the case and the rotating machine can
make contact with each other is formed in the case.     Hereby, the oil and the rotating machine
can make contact with each other in the space, so that the rotating machine can be cooled.
Thus, it is not necessary to provide an exclusive cooling device for cooling the rotating
machine, thereby making it possible to restrain upsizing of the hybrid vehicle correspondingly.
This yields such an effect that downsizing is achieved and the rotating machine can be cooled.

                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
       [0018]     The following describes one embodiment of an FF (front-engine front-wheel
drive) hybrid vehicle to which the present invention is applied, with reference to the drawings.
Note that the present invention is not limited by the present embodiment, but can be also
applied to a hybrid vehicle that employs a rear-engine rear-wheel drive (RR) system, for
example.
       [0019]     FIG. 1 is a skeleton diagram of a hybrid vehicle 1 according to the
embodiment.      As illustrated in FIG. 1, the hybrid vehicle 1 of the embodiment includes an
engine 2, a transaxle 10, and a pair of driving wheels 9.
       [0020]     The transaxle 10 is configured such that a damper 3, a motor generator 4 as a
rotating machine, a torque converter 5, a power transmission mechanism 6, a transmission
mechanism 7, a differential 8, and the like are accommodated in a transaxle case 11, which is
a housing of the transaxle 10.      The transaxle 10 constitutes a power transmission device that
transmits a driving torque input from the engine 2 to the pair of driving wheels 9.

                                                6
       [0021]     An output shaft 2a, which is an output shaft of the engine 2, is connected to
an input shaft 4a of the motor generator 4 via the damper 3. The damper 3 is configured to
restrain and absorb torque fluctuations between the output shaft 2a and the input shaft 4a.
       [0022]     The motor generator 4 functions as an electric motor and a generator, and
includes a stator 4c, and a rotor 4d which is a rotor rotatably provided on an inside-diameter
side of the stator 4c.   The input shaft 4a and an output shaft 4b of the motor generator 4 are
placed on the same axis (first axis) as the output shaft 2a.     A clutch 14 that can interrupt
power transmission between the engine 2 and the motor generator 4 is placed on the
inside-diameter side relative to the rotor 4d, and is connected to an axial end portion of the
input shaft 4a on a side opposite to a side connected to the damper 3.     Since the clutch 14 is
placed on the inside-diameter side relative to the rotor 4d of the motor generator 4, it is
possible to shorten a length of the transaxle 10 in an axial direction of the output shaft 2a in
comparison with a case where the motor generator 4 and the clutch 14 are serially arranged
side by side in the axial direction.        Hereinafter, an "axial direction" in the present
embodiment refers to the axial direction of the output shaft 2a unless a target shaft is specified.
The rotor 4d of the motor generator 4 is provided in the transaxle case 11, and is supported,
via bearings 13, by a pair of wall portions 12a, 12b opposed to each other via the motor
generator 4.
       [0023]     The torque converter 5 is constituted by a pump impeller 5a, a turbine runner
5b, a stator 5c, a one-way clutch (not shown), a cover 5d, and a lock-up clutch 5e.           The
output shaft 4b of the motor generator 4 is connected to the pump impeller 5a via the cover 5d,
and the pump impeller 5a transmits a torque to the turbine runner 5b via a working fluid.
The stator 5c is configured to amplify the torque to be transmitted to the turbine runner 5b
from the pump impeller 5a.      The one-way clutch (not shown) restricts a rotation direction of
the stator 5c to one direction.  The turbine runner 5b is connected to an output shaft 5f of the
torque converter 5.    The lock-up clutch 5e can directly transmit a power to the output shaft
5f of the torque converter 5 from the cover 5d by engaging.

                                                   7
      [0024]      Further, the torque converter 5 is supported by the wall portion 12b that
supports the rotor 4d of the motor generator 4 and a wall portion 12c opposed to the wall
portion 12b in the axial direction via the torque converter 5.         Since the wall portion 12b
serves as supports for the rotor 4d of the motor generator 4 and for the torque converter 5 as
such, the transaxle 10 can have a compact structure in the axial direction.
      [0025]      As illustrated in FIG. 1, in the hybrid vehicle 1 of the embodiment, the
damper 3, the motor generator 4, and the torque converter 5 are placed on the same axis as the
output shaft 2a of the engine 2 in order near the engine 2, so that the power of the engine 2 is
transmitted to the damper 3, the motor generator 4, and the torque converter 5 in this order.
Here, in a case where the torque converter 5 is placed on an engine-2 side relative to the
motor generator 4 in the axial direction, the engine 2 is started by a power of the motor
generator 4 in such a state where the torque converter 5 is locked up by the lock-up clutch 5e.
Accordingly, when such a defect occurs that the torque converter 5 cannot be locked up by the
lock-up clutch 5e, the engine 2 might not be able to be started by the power of the motor
generator 4.    In this regard, in a case where the motor generator 4 is provided on the
engine-2 side relative to the torque converter 5 in the axial direction like the hybrid vehicle 1
of the embodiment, even if such a defect occurs that the torque converter 5 cannot be locked
up by the lock-up clutch 5e, the engine 2 can be started by the power of the motor generator 4.
      [0026]      In the power transmission mechanism 6, a power transmission gear train is
constituted by two gears, i.e., a first gear 6a provided in the output shaft 5f of the torque
converter 5, and a second gear 6b provided in an input shaft 7a of the transmission
mechanism 7.      The power transmission mechanism 6 transmits a power from the output shaft
5f of the torque converter 5 to the input shaft 7a of the transmission mechanism 7 by
decelerating the power at a predetermined speed reducing ratio via the first gear 6a and the
second gear 6b.
      [0027]      Further, the first gear 6a is supported by the wall portion 12c that supports the

                                                 8
torque converter 5 and a wall portion 12d opposed to the wall portion 12c via the first gear 6a
in the axial direction.    Since the wall portion 12c serves as supports for the torque converter
5 and for the first gear 6a of the power transmission mechanism 6 as such, the transaxle 10
can have a compact structure in the axial direction. Note that the first gear 6a may be
supported by the transaxle case 11 instead of the wall portion 12d.            Since an extra wall
portion is not provided between the first gear 6a and the transaxle case 11 in the axial
direction, the transaxle 10 can have a further compact structure in the axial direction.
       [0028]      FIG. 2 is a skeleton diagram of a hybrid vehicle 1 at the time of using a
power transmission mechanism 6 constituted by three gears.            In the power transmission
mechanism 6 illustrated in FIG. 2, a power transmission gear train is constituted by three
gears, i.e., a first gear 61a provided in an output shaft 5f of a torque converter 5, a third gear
61c provided in an input shaft 7a of a transmission mechanism 7, and a second gear 61b
meshing with the first gear 61a and the third gear 61c.      The power transmission mechanism
6 transmits a power from the output shaft 5f of the torque converter 5 to the input shaft 7a of
the transmission mechanism 7 by decelerating the power at a predetermined speed reducing
ratio via the first gear 61a, the second gear 61b, and the third gear 61c.
       [0029]      FIG. 3 is a skeleton diagram of a hybrid vehicle 1 at the time of using a
power transmission mechanism 6 constituted by a pair of pulleys 62a, 62b and a chain 62c.
The power transmission mechanism 6 illustrated in FIG. 3 is constituted by a first pulley 62a
provided in an output shaft 5f of a torque converter 5, a second pulley 62b provided in an
input shaft 7a of a transmission mechanism 7, and a chain 62c wound around the first pulley
62a and the second pulley 62b.        The power transmission mechanism 6 transmits a power
from the output shaft 5f of the torque converter 5 to the input shaft 7a of the transmission
mechanism 7 at a constant speed (a transmission ratio      = 1) via the first pulley 62a, the chain
62c, and the second pulley 62b.
       [0030]       The transmission mechanism 7 is placed so that the input shaft 7a of the
transmission mechanism 7 is positioned on an axis (second axis) different from an output

                                               9
shaft 2a of an engine 2.      As the transmission mechanism 7, a mechanism including a
planetary gear mechanism, a mechanism including a continuously variable transmission, and
the like can be used.
       [0031]     FIG. 4 is a skeleton diagram of a hybrid vehicle 1 at the time of using a
transmission mechanism 7 including a planetary gear mechanism.          Note that the hybrid
vehicle 1 illustrated in FIG. 4 includes the aforementioned power transmission mechanism 6
constituted by three gears.   The transmission mechanism 7 illustrated in FIG. 4 includes an
input shaft 7a, a sun gear shaft 172, a primary transmission portion 173, a secondary
transmission portion 174, and a counter drive gear 175, which are provided in a transmission
mechanism case 170.      The input shaft 7a and the sun gear shaft 172 are rotatably supported
by the transmission mechanism case 170.       The input shaft 7a is connected to the sun gear
shaft 172 on the same axis, so that the input shaft 7a and the sun gear shaft 172 rotate
synchronously.     A power transmitted to the input shaft 7a from the third gear 61c of the
power transmission mechanism 6 is changed in speed by either or both of the primary
transmission portion 173 and the secondary transmission portion 174, and is output from the
counter drive gear 175 connected to a carrier CF1 (described later) of the primary
transmission portion 173.
       [0032]     The primary transmission portion 173 includes a planetary gear mechanism
176, a clutch Cl, a clutch C2, a brake B2, and a one-way clutch Fl.        The planetary gear
mechanism 176 is placed around the sun gear shaft 172, and includes a sun gear SR connected
to the sun gear shaft 172 via the clutch Cl, a sun gear SF placed coaxially with the sun gear
SR and displaced therefrom along the axial direction, a long pinion gear PL, a short pinion
gear PS, a ring gear RI, and a carrier CFl.      The sun gear SR, the sun gear SF, the long
pinion gear PL, the short pinion gear PS, the ring gear RI, and the carrier CF1 are rotatable.
The sun gear SR and the sun gear SF are rotatably supported by the sun gear shaft 172 via
bearings.
       [0033]     The long pinion gear PL is placed around the sun gear SF and the sun gear

                                               10
SR.    The short pinion gear PS is placed around the sun gear SF.     The ring gear RI is placed
around the long pinion gear PL.     The ring gear RI is connected to the sun gear shaft 172 via
the clutch C2.    The ring gear RI can be fixed to the transmission mechanism case 170 by the
brake B2.    The one-way clutch Fl is provided between the transmission mechanism case 170
and the ring gear RI, and is configured to allow the ring gear RI to rotate only in one
direction, but prevent the ring gear RI from rotating in the other direction
      [0034]      The carrier CF1 is placed on either side of the short pinion gear PS and the
long pinion gear PL.     The carrier CF1 supports the short pinion gear PS via a first pinion
shaft TI rotatably supporting the short pinion gear PS.      The carrier CF1 supports the long
pinion gear PL via a second pinion shaft T2 rotatably supporting the long pinion gear PL.
The sun gear SF is connected to a carrier CR of a planetary gear mechanism 177 constituting
the secondary transmission portion 174 (described later) with a spline connection portion on
the same axis, and rotates synchronously with the carrier CR.
      [0035]      The long pinion gear PL meshes with the sun gear SR and the ring gear RI.
The short pinion gear PS meshes with the long pinion gear PL and the sun gear SF.         One of
the sun gear SR and the ring gear RI functions as an input element by connection with a
corresponding one of the clutch C1 and the clutch C2.      The planetary gear mechanism 176 is
formed in a power transmittable manner between the sun gear SR or the ring gear RI as the
input element and the carrier CF 1 as an output element.
      [0036]      The counter drive gear 175 engages with a differential ring gear 8a, and a
power output to the counter drive gear 175 is transmitted to drive shafts 91 connected to
driving wheels 9 via a differential 8 connected to the differential ring gear 8a, so as to drive
the driving wheels 9.
      [0037]      The secondary transmission portion 174 includes            the planetary gear
mechanism 177, a brake B 1, and a brake B3.      The planetary gear mechanism 177 includes a
carrier CR rotatably placed around the sun gear shaft 172, a carrier CF2, a sun gear S2

                                               11
integrally provided in the sun gear shaft 172, a ring gear R2 placed around the sun gear S2,
and a pinion gear P2 meshing with the sun gear S2 and the ring gear R2.      The carrier CR and
the carrier CF2 are placed on either side of the pinion gear P2, and support the pinion gear P2
via a pinion shaft T rotatably supporting the pinion gear P2.    The carrier CF2 can be fixed to
the transmission mechanism case 170 by the brake B 1.       The ring gear R2 can be fixed to the
transmission mechanism case 170 by the brake B3.
       [0038]     FIG. 5 is a skeleton diagram of a hybrid vehicle 1 at the time of using a
transmission mechanism 7 including a continuously variable transmission.          Note that the
hybrid vehicle 1 illustrated in FIG. 5 includes the aforementioned power transmission
mechanism 6 constituted by three gears.     The transmission mechanism 7 illustrated in FIG. 5
includes a forward/reverse switching device 271 connected to an input shaft 7a, an input shaft
272 connected to the forward/reverse switching device 271, a continuously variable
transmission 273 connected to the input shaft 272, an output shaft 274 connected to the
continuously variable transmission 273, a reduction gear 275, and the like.
       [0039]     The forward/reverse switching device 271 includes a planetary gear 271p, a
forward clutch C, and a reverse brake B.       A sun gear 271s of the planetary gear 271p is
connected to the input shaft 7a, a sun gear 271c of the planetary gear 271p is connected to the
input shaft 272, and a ring gear 271r of the planetary gear 271p is selectively connected to a
housing (not shown) via the reverse brake B.       Further, the sun gear 271c and the sun gear
271s are connected selectively via the forward clutch C.       In the forward/reverse switching
device 271 configured as such, when the forward clutch C is engaged and the reverse brake B
is disengaged, a forward power transmission path is formed.      Further, when the reverse brake
B is engaged and the forward clutch C is disengaged, a reverse power transmission path is
formed.    Further, when the forward clutch C and the reverse brake B are both disengaged,
the forward/reverse switching device 271 enters a neutral condition (a power transmission
interrupted state) where the power transmission is interrupted.
       [0040]     The continuously variable transmission 273 includes a primary pulley 276

                                                12
provided in the input shaft 272, a secondary pulley 277 provided in the output shaft 274, a
transmission belt 278 wound around between the primary pulley 276 and the secondary pulley
277, and the like.
       [0041]     The primary pulley 276 includes a fixed sheave 276a fixed to the input shaft
272, and a moving sheave 276b provided non-rotatable relative to the input shaft 272 around
its axis, but movable in an axial direction of the input shaft 272.  Further, the primary pulley
276 includes a hydraulic actuator (not shown) configured to give a thrust in the primary
pulley 276 so as to change a V-groove width between the fixed sheave 276a and the moving
sheave 276b.     The secondary pulley 277 includes a fixed sheave 277a fixed to the output
shaft 274, and a moving sheave 277b provided non-rotatable relative to the output shaft 274
around its axis, but movable in an axial direction of the output shaft 274.          Further, the
secondary pulley 277 includes a hydraulic actuator (not shown) configured to give a thrust in
the secondary pulley 277 so as to change a V-groove width between the fixed sheave 277a and
the moving sheave 277b.        In the continuously variable transmission 273, the V-groove
widths of the primary pulley 276 and the secondary pulley 277 are changed so as to change a
winding radius of the transmission belt 278, so that a transmission ratio is changed.
       [0042]     An output gear 279 is attached to the output shaft 274 of the continuously
variable transmission 273 so as to rotate together in an integrated manner.      The output gear
279 meshes with a counter driven gear 275a of the reduction gear 275.       A counter drive gear
275b of the reduction gear 275 meshes with a differential ring gear 8a of a differential 8.
       [0043]     Referring back to FIG. 1, the differential ring gear 8a meshing with a drive
pinion gear (not shown) to which a power from the transmission mechanism 7 is transmitted
is connected to the differential 8.       Further, the drive shafts 91 are connected to the
differential 8, and the driving wheels 9 provided in a pair are attached to opposite axial ends
of the drive shafts 91.
       [0044]     The hybrid vehicle 1 of the embodiment has a plurality of running modes

                                                 13
such as an engine running mode in which the hybrid vehicle 1 runs only by use of the engine
2 as a drive source, a motor generator running mode in which the hybrid vehicle 1 runs only
by use of the motor generator 4 as a drive source, and a hybrid running mode in which the
hybrid vehicle 1 runs by use of both the engine 2 and the motor generator 4, and the hybrid
vehicle 1 runs by switching the running modes depending on an operating state such as an
accelerator operation amount (a requested driving force of a driver) and a vehicle speed.
Further, when an accelerator-OFF state in which the accelerator operation amount becomes
zero is established during each running mode, coasting (free run) is performed.      At the time
of coasting, the engine 2 is stopped, thereby making it possible to achieve improvement of
fuel efficiency.    Further, at the time of coasting, vehicle deceleration, and the like, a
rotational force of the driving wheels 9 is transmitted to the motor generator 4 via a power
transmission path, so as to generate an electric power by regeneration of the motor generator 4,
so that a battery (not shown) is charged with the electric power thus generated.
       [0045]     The clutch 14 is provided in a power transmission path (first power
transmission path) between the engine 2 and the motor generator 4, and when the clutch 14 is
connected, power transmission is performable between the engine 2 and the motor generator 4,
thereby making it possible to rotate the engine 2 and the motor generator 4 in an integrated
manner.     Meanwhile, when the clutch 14 is disconnected, the power transmission is
interrupted between the engine 2 and the motor generator 4, thereby making it possible to
rotate the engine 2 and the motor generator 4 independently from each other.
       [0046]     In the hybrid vehicle 1 of the embodiment, a power transmission path (second
power transmission path) between the motor generator 4 and the driving wheels 9 is
connected in a state where the power transmission is interrupted between the engine 2 and the
motor generator 4, and an electric power can be generated by regeneration of the motor
generator 4 by a rotational force from a driving-wheel-9 side.    On this account, at the time of
coasting, the clutch 14 is disconnected, thereby making it possible to restrain a decrease in
regeneration efficiency of the motor generator 4 due to a dragging resistance that can be
caused in the engine 2 that is stopped during the coasting.

       [0047]     FIG. 6 is a view illustrating a positional relationship of constituents in the
transaxle case 11 when the transaxle 10 is viewed from an engine-2 side in the axial direction.
In a lower part of a space 20 formed within the transaxle case 11, an oil 30 to be used for
lubrication of the transmission mechanism 7, the differential 8, and the like is accumulated,
and the motor generator 4 is partially soaked in the oil 30.      Hereby, by bringing the motor
generator 4 into contact with the oil 30 accumulated in the transaxle case 11, it is possible to
cool the motor generator 4.
       [0048]     Further, the differential ring gear 8a is partially soaked in the oil 30
accumulated in the lower part of the space 20 formed in the case 11, and the motor generator
4 and the differential ring gear 8a are placed within the space 20 with such a positional
relationship that the oil 30 scooped up by rotating the differential ring gear 8a in a
counterclockwise direction in FIG. 6 can make contact with the motor generator 4.
       [0049]     More specifically, in the hybrid vehicle 1 of the embodiment, the motor
generator 4 and the differential ring gear 8a are placed such that the differential ring gear 8a is
positioned on a torque-converter-5 side relative to the motor generator 4 in the axial direction,
so that a part of the motor generator 4 and a part of the differential ring gear 8a overlap with
each other when viewed from the axial direction of the output shaft 2a (overlap with each
other when viewed from the axial direction), as illustrated in FIG. 6.     Further, any shielding
such as a wall portion that obstructs the oil 30 scooped up by the differential ring gear 8a from
being poured over the motor generator 4 is not provided between the motor generator 4 and
the differential ring gear 8a inside the space 20.       Hereby, a distance between the motor
generator 4 and the differential ring gear 8a is made closer in the radial direction, so that the
oil 30 scooped up by the differential ring gear 8a can be easily poured over the motor
generator 4, thereby making it possible to improve coolability of the motor generator 4.
Further, since the distance between the motor generator 4 and the differential ring gear 8a can
be made closer in the radial direction, it is possible to achieve downsizing of the transaxle 10
in the radial direction correspondingly.

                                                  15
       [0050]     As such, in the hybrid vehicle 1 of the embodiment, the motor generator 4 is
provided in the transaxle case 11, and the space 20 in which the oil 30 accumulated in the
transaxle case 11 can make contact with the motor generator 4 is formed in the transaxle case
11.   When the oil 30 and the motor generator 4 make contact with each other in the space 20,
the motor generator 4 is cooled.      Hereby, it is not necessary to provide an exclusive cooling
device for cooling the motor generator 4, thereby making it possible to restrain upsizing of the
hybrid vehicle 1 correspondingly.      Accordingly, it is possible to achieve downsizing and to
cool the motor generator 4.
       [0051]     Note that, even if the shielding is provided between the motor generator 4
and the differential ring gear 8a, such a configuration is presumable that a pipe or the like is
provided to pour the oil 30 over the motor generator 4.        In this regard, in a case where the
shielding is not provided between the motor generator 4 and the differential ring gear 8a like
the hybrid vehicle 1 of the embodiment, a constituent such as the pipe can be omitted, thereby
making it possible to achieve cost reduction correspondingly.
       [0052]     Further, as described above, by placing the motor generator 4 on the engine-2
side relative to the torque converter 5, it is possible to place the motor generator 4 and the
differential ring gear 8a so as to be close to each other in many constituent arrangements that
can be employed in the transaxle 10 included in the FF hybrid vehicle 1. Accordingly, the
placement of the motor generator 4 on the engine-2 side relative to the torque converter 5 is
effective to secure the coolability of the motor generator 4 by scooping of the oil by the
differential ring gear 8a.
       [0053]     FIG. 7 is a skeleton diagram of a hybrid vehicle 1 in a case where a
differential ring gear 8a is positioned on an engine-2 side relative to a motor generator 4 in the
axial direction.   FIG. 8 is a view illustrating a positional relationship of constituents in a
transaxle case 11 when a transaxle 10 of the hybrid vehicle 1 illustrated in FIG. 7 is viewed
from an engine-2 side in the axial direction.

       [0054]      In the hybrid vehicle 1 of the embodiment, as illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8, the
differential ring gear 8a may be positioned on the engine-2 side relative to the motor generator
4 in the axial direction.    Even in a case where the motor generator 4 and the differential ring
gear 8a are placed as such, the motor generator 4 and the differential ring gear 8a can be
placed to be closer to each other, so that an oil 30 scooped up by the differential ring gear 8a
can be easily poured over the motor generator 4, thereby making it possible to improve
coolability of the motor generator 4.    Further, since the distance between the motor generator
4 and the differential ring gear 8a can be made closer in the radial direction, it is possible to
achieve downsizing of the transaxle 10 in the radial direction correspondingly.
       [0055]      FIG. 9 is a skeleton diagram of a hybrid vehicle 1 in a case where a motor
generator 4 and a differential ring gear 8a are placed so that the motor generator 4 is
positioned on an extension line of the differential ring gear 8a in a radial direction.   FIG. 10
is a view illustrating a positional relationship of constituents in a transaxle case 11 when a
transaxle 10 of the hybrid vehicle 1 illustrated in FIG. 9 is viewed from an engine-2 side in
the axial direction.
       [0056]      In the hybrid vehicle 1 of the embodiment, as illustrated in FIGS. 9 and 10,
the motor generator 4 and the differential ring gear 8a may be placed so that the motor
generator 4 is positioned on an extension line of the differential ring gear 8a in the radial
direction.    In a case where the motor generator 4 and the differential ring gear 8a are placed
as such, an oil 30 scooped up by the differential ring gear 8a can be more easily poured over
the motor generator 4, thereby making it possible to improve coolability of the motor
generator 4.
