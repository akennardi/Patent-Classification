                                PHOSPHONO PARAFFINS
                                            FIELD
        Aspects of the present disclosure generally relate to phosphono paraffins,
hydraulic fluids comprising phosphono paraffins, and methods of making phosphono
paraffins.
                                       BACKGROUND
       Many vehicles, such as aircraft, cars, trucks, etc., have one or more hydraulic
systems which are drives or transmission systems that use pressurized hydraulic
fluid to power hydraulic machinery. For example, early vehicles had hydraulic brake
systems. As vehicles became more sophisticated, newer systems with hydraulic
power were developed. Hydraulic systems in, for example, an aircraft provide for the
operation of vehicle components, such as landing gear, flaps, flight control surfaces,
and brakes.
       A hydraulic system has a power generating device (pump) reservoir,
accumulator, heat exchanger, and filtering system. System operating pressure may
vary from a couple hundred pounds per square inch (psi) in small vehicles and
rotorcraft to 5,000 psi in large vehicles.
       Hydraulic system fluids ("hydraulic fluids") flow through components of the
hydraulic system during use to transmit and distribute forces to various components
of the hydraulic system. If a number of passages exist in a system, pressure can be
distributed through the various components of the system. Hydraulic operations have
only negligible loss due to fluid friction.
       If incompressibility and fluidity were the only qualities required, most liquids that
are not too thick could be used in a hydraulic system.          However, other properties
should be considered when selecting a desired hydraulic fluid for a particular
hydraulic system.
                                               1

       One of those properties is viscosity, which is a resistance of the fluid to flow. A
liquid such as gasoline that has a low viscosity flows easily, while a liquid such as tar
that has a high viscosity flows slowly. Viscosity increases as temperature decreases.
A liquid for a given hydraulic system should have enough viscosity to give a good
seal at pumps, valves, and pistons, but should not be so thick that it offers resistance
to flow, leading to power loss and higher operating temperatures which may promote
wear of hydraulic system components. A fluid that is not viscous enough can wear
moving parts or parts that have heavy loads.
       Another property pertinent to hydraulic fluids is the fire point of the fluid, which
is the temperature at which a substance gives off vapor in sufficient quantity to ignite
and continue to burn when exposed to a spark or flame. Like a flash point, a high fire
point is desirable of hydraulic liquids.
       Known hydraulic fluids do not possess ideal properties as discussed above.
Polyalphaolefin-based hydraulic fluids are fire-resistant but have a high viscosity and
are limited to use down to - 40 0 F. Phosphate ester-based (Skydrol@) hydraulic fluids
are not entirely fire-resistant and under certain conditions, they burn. Furthermore,
polyalphaolefin-based hydraulic fluids and phosphate ester-based hydraulic fluids do
not mix with each other. Furthermore, fluorocarbon-based hydraulic fluids tend to
degrade paint and titanium couplings on the hydraulic lines of a hydraulic system.
There is also a movement                to ban    production of chlorocarbon-based      and
fluorocarbon-based      hydraulic       fluids  because     of  their toxicity  and    poor
biodegradability. For example, chloroparaffins are stable in soil and persist in soil for
years, having a half-life (T1 /2 ) of at least months to years.
       Furthermore, synthesis of hydraulic fluids tends to be laborious and cost
intensive.    Conventional reactions, such as the Arbuzov reaction, do not yield
hydraulic fluids having ideal properties as described above. An Arbuzov reaction
proceeds by reacting a primary alkyl halide with a phosphite to form a primary
phosphono-substituted product.            The Arbuzov reaction does not proceed readily
                                                2

using primary, secondary, or tertiary fluoro alkane starting material or using
secondary or tertiary chloro-, bromo-, iodo-alkane starting materials.
       Therefore, there is a need in the art for new and improved hydraulic fluids and
methods of making hydraulic fluids.
                                         SUMMARY
       In one aspect, a method of making a phosphono paraffin comprises forming a
reaction mixture by mixing a haloparaffin, a phosphite and sodium iodide. Methods
to make the composition comprise heating the reaction mixture to form the
phosphono paraffin.

                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
       Aspects of the present disclosure include methods of making phosphono
paraffins. It was discovered that sodium iodide in the presence of haloparaffin and
phosphite readily promotes phosphono paraffin formation. In at least one aspect, a
method of making phosphono paraffins includes mixing a haloparaffin with a
phosphite and sodium iodide.
       Methods of the present disclosure provide access to a new class of phosphono
paraffin compounds. Accordingly, aspects of the present disclosure further comprise
phosphono paraffins having between about 6 and about 24 carbons and between
about 2 and about 8 phosphono substituents. These compounds can be used as
fire-resistant, biodegradable hydraulic fluids. Without being bound by theory, it is
believed that phosphono paraffins are viable candidates for use as fire-resistant
                                               4

hydraulic fluids because of their long alkyl chains for ideal viscosity and phosphonate
moieties that meet the desirable parameters for fire-resistance and biodegradability.
                                  Phosphono Paraffins
       Phosphono paraffins of the present disclosure have between about 6 and
about 24 carbons and between about 2 and about 8 phosphono substituents. In at
least one aspect, a phosphono paraffin has a fire point greater than about 200 0C,
such as greater than about 220 0C, such as greater than about 240 0C. In at least one
aspect, a phosphono paraffin has a flash point of greater than about 150 0C, such as
greater than about 170 0 C, such as greater than about 190 0C. In at least one aspect,
a phosphono paraffin has a melting point of less than about -40 0 C, such as less than
about -55 0C, such as less than about -70 0 C.
       The flash point and the fire point of a phosphono paraffin can be determined
by ASTM D92 using a SetaFlash Series 3 Open Cup Flash Point tester supplied by
John Morris Scientific Pty Ltd.    The melting point of a phosphono paraffin can be
determined as follows: approximately 1 ml of fluid is placed in a 3 mm diameter glass
NMR tube, and a stainless steel thermocouple probe inserted into the fluid. The tube
is then placed in liquid nitrogen to freeze the fluid, which prevents movement of the
thermocouple probe in the frozen fluid. The tube is then slowly warmed and the fluid
eventually melts. Upon melting of the fluid, the thermocouple probe can be pulled
free.  The temperature at which the thermocouple can be pulled from the fluid is
taken as the melting point. This process is repeated two more times to obtain an
average melting point value.
       In at least one aspect, a phosphono paraffin of the present disclosure is
represented by formula (I):

includes C1-10 alkyl and C1-5 alkyl. C3 -2 0 cycloalkyl includes C3 -1 0 cycloalkyl and C3 -6
cycloalkyl. In at least one aspect, each instance of R1 and R2 is independently linear

                         Methods of Making Phosphono Paraffins
        It was discovered that synthesizing phosphono paraffins under conventional
Arbuzov reaction conditions does not form phosphono paraffins.                      It was also
discovered that mixing a haloparaffin and a phosphite with sodium idodide promotes
phosphono paraffin formation.          In at least one aspect, a method of making a
phosphono paraffin comprises forming a reaction mixture by mixing a haloparaffin
with a phosphite and sodium iodide.             Haloparaffin includes a chloroparaffin, a
bromoparaffin, or an iodoparaffin. A haloparaffin can include one or more secondary
halogen moieties. The reaction mixture is heated to form a reaction product having a
phosphono paraffin.      The phosphono paraffin may be isolated from the reaction
product at an overall yield of between about 20% and about 80%, such as between
about 40% and about 60%.

The presence of sodium iodide in the reaction mixture promotes formation of the
phosphono paraffin.      Alternatively, a method of making a phosphono paraffin
comprises forming a reaction mixture by mixing sodium iodide with a haloparaffin
followed by addition of a phosphite. Alternatively, a method of making a phosphono
paraffin comprises forming a reaction mixture by mixing sodium iodide with a
phosphite followed by addition of a haloparaffin. As shown in Scheme 1, a reaction
mixture can be heated to promote reaction of at least one of the starting materials to
form a reaction product having a phosphono paraffin.        For example, a reaction
mixture can be heated to a temperature of between about 120 0 C and about 200 0C,
such as between about 130 0C and about 190 0 C, such as between about 140 0 C and
about 180 0C. Furthermore, phosphono paraffin formation is typically exothermic, so
the exotherm may be controlled to prevent a runaway reaction at these temperatures.
Two non-limiting methods to control the exotherm include: (1) Arbuzov reactions
produce alkyl halides as a byproduct, and distilling this byproduct from the reaction
mixture removes some heat, and/or (2) phosphite can be cooled and/or added slowly
to the reaction mixture to reduce the temperature.
        In at least one aspect, a method of making a phosphono paraffin comprises
forming a reaction mixture by mixing sodium iodide and a haloparaffin and heating
the reaction mixture and/or stirring the reaction mixture.   The reaction mixture is
heated to a temperature of between about 120 0 C and about 2000 C, such as between
about 130 0C and about 180 0 C, such as between about 140 0C and about 160 0C.
After a desired period of time, the reaction mixture can be allowed to cool to, for
example, room temperature.        A phosphite can be added to the cooled reaction
mixture to form a second reaction mixture.      The second reaction mixture can be
heated (and/or stirred) to form a reaction product. The second reaction mixture can
be heated at a temperature of between about 120 0 C and about 2000 C, such as
between about 130 0C and about 180 0 C, such as between about 140 0 C and about
160 0C. The first and/or second reaction mixtures can be cooled using any suitable
cooling bath to maintain the reaction mixture(s) at a desirable temperature, such as
                                          34

the temperatures described above.       After a desired period of time, the reaction
product can be allowed to cool to, for example, room temperature.
        A reaction mixture of the present disclosure can be solvent-free (neat) or can
further   comprise    one   or  more   suitable   solvents.    Solvents   can   include
dimethylsulfoxide,    dimethylformamide,    chlorobenzene,    N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone,
xylenes, and mixtures thereof. A reaction mixture can be stirred.
        In one aspect, at least one molar equivalent of phosphite is present in a
reaction mixture for every halogen moiety of a haloparaffin starting material.      For
example, if a haloparaffin has three chlorine moieties, then a molar ratio of
phosphite:haloparaffin is at least 3:1.     A molar ratio of phosphite:haloparaffin is
between about 1:1 and about 10:1, such as between about 2:1 and about 6:1, such
as between about 3:1 and about 5:1.
        In one aspect, at least one molar equivalent of sodium iodide is present in a
reaction mixture for every halogen moiety of a haloparaffin starting material.      For
example, if a haloparaffin has three chlorine moieties, then a molar ratio of sodium
iodide:haloparaffin is at least 3:1.   A molar ratio of sodium iodide:haloparaffin is
between about 1:1 and about 10:1, such as between about 2:1 and about 6:1, such
as between about 3:1 and about 5:1.
        The progress of phosphono paraffin formation during or after methods of the
present disclosure may be monitored by thin layer chromatography and/or nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
        After heating a reaction mixture of the present disclosure for a desired period
of time to form a reaction product, the reaction product is allowed to cool to, for
example, room temperature.       The phosphono paraffin of the reaction product can
then be isolated from any unreacted haloparaffin, phosphite and sodium iodide
starting materials and a sodium halide byproduct, such as sodium chloride.          For
example, in at least one aspect, water is added to a reaction product to form a
                                           35

biphasic mixture having an aqueous phase and an organic phase.                 The biphasic
mixture may be stirred vigorously or shaken to promote mixing of the two phases.
After stirring/shaking, the mixture reforms a biphasic mixture. The aqueous phase
comprises sodium iodide and the sodium halide byproduct.                The organic phase
comprises phosphono paraffin and unreacted haloparaffin (if any) and/or phosphite (if
any). The organic phase can be drained from the aqueous phase. If the organic
phase contains haloparaffin and/or phosphite, the haloparaffin and/or phosphite can
be distilled from the phosphono paraffin to yield isolated phosphono paraffin.
Furthermore, some phosphono paraffin may be present in the aqueous phase after
stirring/shaking.    Therefore, the aqueous phase may be stirred/shaken with an
organic solvent (such as hexane) to form a biphasic mixture after settling, the
biphasic mixture having an aqueous phase and an organic (hexane) phase.                The
organic phase can be drained from the aqueous phase followed by distillation of
hexane (and haloparaffin/phosphite if present) to yield isolated phosphono paraffin.
        In at least one aspect, potassium iodide or potassium bromide is included in a
reaction mixture of the present disclosure, instead of or in addition to, sodium iodide.

added to form a reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred, brought under a
nitrogen atmosphere, and heated to approximately 160 0 C.           At this point an
exothermic reaction began and the temperature increased to approximately 245'C
over a timespan of about 30 minutes. The mixture was then slowly cooled over a
time span of an additional 30 minutes. Once at room temperature deionized water
(100 ml) was added to the reaction product to form a biphasic mixture. The mixture
was vigorously stirred, and then the water and organic phases were allowed to
separate. The organic phase was drained from the aqueous phase and then distilled
under vacuum to remove residual water and unreacted tributyl phosphite and
Cereclor AS45. Distillation was achieved at 153 0 C at 0.618 mbar. The final mass of
reaction product was 26.98 g (58% yield).

       When sodium bromide is mixed with Cereclor AS45 and tributyl phosphite and
heated, a phosphono paraffin is not formed.
        Furthermore, mixing iodine    (12)  with Cereclor AS45 and tributyl phosphite and
heating the reaction mixture does not form a phosphono paraffin at least for the
reason that the boiling point of iodine is lower than a reaction temperature of 160 0 C.
       Lastly, when 20 mol% ZnBr 2 is mixed with Cereclor AS45 and triethyl
phosphite and heated, the mass of material remaining after removal of triethyl
phosphite by distillation indicates about 30% conversion of Cereclor AS45 into a
reaction product having a phosphono paraffin, and the          1H   NMR spectrum of the
product is consistent with the mass of material determination.          Furthermore, the
                                                 38

expected zinc salts do not precipitate from the reaction product, which should be
removed for the phosphono paraffin to be used as a hydraulic fluid. In comparison,
sodium salts, such as NaCI, formed during methods of the present disclosure do
precipitate from the phosphono paraffin reaction product.           Furthermore, ZnBr 2 is
significantly more expensive than Nal, hindering the industrial applicability of ZnBr 2
as a reagent for large scale chemical reactions.

C12 , 12,  Br 2 ) to form a reaction mixture.   The reaction mixture is then exposed to
ultraviolet (UV) light and/or a radical initiator to form a haloparaffin. Radical initiators
include peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide.
          As an example, in a nitrogen atmosphere, dodecane was mixed with 5 molar
equivalents of Br2 to form a reaction mixture. The reaction mixture exposed to UV
light to yield a reaction product having bromoparaffins. The reaction product was
exposed to ambient atmosphere, quenched with water and an organic solvent
(hexane) was added to form a biphasic mixture having an aqueous phase and an
organic (hexane) phase.         The biphasic mixture was shaken and then allowed to
settle. The organic phase of the biphasic mixture was drained.            Hexane, residual
water, and dodecane starting material were distilled from the organic phase to
provide bromoparaffin product (12% yield).
