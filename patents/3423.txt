                                            AN AERATOR
   [0001]          The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent
   Application No. 2011244989, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
 5 reference.
   [0002]          The present invention relates to the problem of treating and/or preventing
   anoxic conditions in a body of water. More specifically, the invention relates to a
   device used to treat and/or prevent anoxic conditions in a body of water, and will be
   generally described in this context. It is to be appreciated, however, that the invention
10 may have other applications to those specifically described herein.
   Background of the Invention
   [0003]          Water aeration is often required in water bodies that suffer from anoxic
   conditions. These conditions are often caused by human activities, such as sewage
   discharges, agricultural run-off, or over-fishing a lake.
15 [0004]          Oxygen is a major contributor to water quality. Fish and other aquatic
   animals require oxygen, as do oxygen breathing aerobic bacteria, which decompose
   organic matter. When oxygen concentrations become low, anoxic conditions may
   develop which can decrease the ability of the water body to support life.
   [0005]          Aeration is generally known to accelerate the process of oxidizing organic
20 and mineral pollution, which is generally desirable in a marine environment.
   [0006]          Aeration can be achieved by infusing air at an appropriate location into the
   body of water. This can occur at any desired water depth or at the water surface.
   [0007]          Various arrangements exist for aerating water. Some of these are designed
   to operate at or proximate the bottom of the body of water. This generally results in a
25 large and expensive design, which requires regular and expensive maintenance.
   [0008]          Other aerators include those configured to supply oxygen at or near the
   water surface. These designs, too, are generally quite expensive and require constant
   and expensive maintenance. Such designs are also generally large and cumbersome,

                                                   2
   and so require heavy lifting machinery to deliver them to or remove them from site.
   They also generally, include a relatively large capacity water pump, which consumes
   a large amount of power and leaves an undesirably large carbon footprint.
   [0009]          It would therefore be desirable to provide an aerator that at least partially
 5 addresses the above described drawbacks and limitations associated with existing
   aerators.
   Summary of the Invention
   [0010]          According to a broad aspect of the present invention, there is provided an
   aerator. The aerator includes an aerated water delivery system, and a flotation device
10 for, in use, floating on a body of water to be aerated. The flotation device is provided
   for, in use, supporting the aerated water delivery system in an operating position
   relative to the body of water. The aerated water delivery system includes a water inlet
   for drawing water from the body of water, at least one air inlet, and at least one
   aerated water outlet for dispensing aerated water into the body of water. At least one
15 of the aerated water outlets is adjustable to adjust the flow direction of aerated water
   exiting the outlet relative to the aerator.
   [0011]          In a preferred form, the aerated water delivery system includes four
   aerated water outlets.
   [0012]          Each aerated water outlet may be adjustable.
20 [0013]          The aerated water delivery system may include a plurality of air inlets. It is
   particularly envisaged that the system may include four air inlets.
   [0014]          Preferably, the aerator includes a plurality of water delivery paths. In one
   specific form, there is provided a first water delivery path extending between the water
   inlet and a first aerated water outlet; a second water delivery path extending between
25 the water inlet and a second aerated water outlet; a third water delivery path
   extending between the water inlet and a third aerated water outlet; and a fourth water
   delivery path extending between the water inlet and a fourth aerated water outlet.
   SPEC-926709.doc

                                                     3
   [0015]          In an embodiment including the four separate water delivery paths of the
   type referred to immediately above, there is also preferably provided a dedicated air
   delivery path for each water delivery path. In such a configuration, water supplied
   through each water delivery path combines with air supplied through each respective
 5 air delivery path to provide aerated water from each aerated water outlet.
   [0016]          In the above described arrangement, there is preferably provided a first air
   delivery path extending between a first air inlet and a first air delivery port, the first air
   delivery port feeding into the first water delivery path between the water inlet and first
   aerated water outlet; and a second air delivery path extending between a second air
10 inlet and a second air delivery port, the second air delivery port feeding into the
   second water delivery path between the water inlet and second aerated water outlet.
   There is also provided a third air delivery path extending between a third air inlet and
   a third air delivery port, the third air delivery port feeding into the third water delivery
   path between the water inlet and third aerated water outlet; and a fourth air delivery
15 path extending between a fourth air inlet and a fourth air delivery port, the fourth air
   delivery port feeding into the fourth water delivery path between the water inlet and
   fourth aerated water outlet.
   [0017]          Most preferably, the water delivery system includes a water pump for, in
   use, pumping water through the water inlet towards each of the aerated water outlets.
20 [0018]          Any suitable style and size of pump may be adopted. In one preferred
   form, the water pump is an electrically powered water pump of approximately 4.2kW.
   Such a configuration would typically require three-phase power.
   [0019]          In use, the flotation device is preferably configured for supporting the water
   pump below the surface of the body of water. The vertical distance between the pump
25 and the flotation device may be adjustable.
   [0020]          In an alternate form, the pump is a land-mounted hydraulic pump, which is
   operable by a small electric motor. One potential advantage of such a configuration is
   that the output of the electric motor is easily variable, such that the output of the
   hydraulic pump can by varied within the pump's operating limits to suit a specific
   SPEC-926709.doc

                                                     4
   application. Another advantage of such an arrangement is that it potentially doesn't
   require three-phase power.
   [0021]          In one form, the flotation device is in the form of a pontoon and includes a
   pair of floats, with the floats connected together by a support (or mounting) frame.
 5 The support frame would be provided for mounting the aerated water delivery system
   thereto.
   [0022]          The floats may be of any suitable shape. For example, each float may be
   generally elongate, with the floats arranged substantially parallel with a space
   provided between the floats for accommodating at least a portion of the aerated water
10 delivery system.
   [0023]          A tethering line(s) or an anchor may be provided for retaining the aerator in
   a desired position on a body of water.
   [0024]          Each air delivery path preferably includes a respective air delivery path
   venturi for generating an increase in the flow rate of air through the path. Applicant's
15 delivery system is designed such that air is entrained into the respective water flow
   paths via the respective air delivery ports.
   [0025]          Each water delivery path between the water inlet and air delivery port
   preferably includes a respective water delivery path venturi for generating an increase
   in the flow rate of water through the water delivery path.
20 [0026]          Thus far, reference has been made to the invention being used in a body of
   water to provide aerated water. However, the invention may be used on other fluid
   bodies, for aerating the fluid.
   Brief Description of the Figures
   [0027]          It will be convenient to hereinafter describe a preferred embodiment of the
25 invention with reference to the accompanying drawing, graphs and photograph. The
   particularity of the drawing, graphs and photograph is to be understood as not limiting
   the preceding broad description of the invention.

   embodiment of the present invention.
   [0029]          Figure 2 is a perspective view of a photograph of the aerator illustrated in
   Figure 1 when in use.
 5 [0030]          Figure 3 is a graph showing the re-oxygenation of water as a function of
   time when measuring the aerated water output from only one of the water outlets of
   the aerator illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2.
   [0031]          Figure 4 is a semi-log plot of the data shown in Fig. 3.
   Detailed Description of the Figures
10 [0032]          Referring to the Figures 1 and 2, there is illustrated an aerator 10. The
   aerator 10 is shown floating on a lake L. However, it is to be appreciated that the
   aerator 10 may be used to aerate various types of water (or other fluid) bodies. For
   example, the aerator 10 may be used to aerate a pond, lagoon, dam, lake, reservoir,
   settlement pond, sewerage treatment plant, nursery, golf course lagoon, sportsground
15 water supply, farm, aquaculture, winery or brewery. Other applications are also
   possible.
   [0033]          The overall dimensions of the aerator 10 are in the order of 1860 mm (I),
   1500 mm (w) and 300 mm (d), although it is to be appreciated that these dimensions
   may be varied to suit a specific application. The weight of the aerator 10 would be in
20 the order of 200kg, although this, too, may be varied to suit a specific application.
   [0034]          The aerator 10 includes an aerated water delivery system 12. The delivery
   system 12 includes a water pump (not shown). In the illustrated aerator 10, the water
   pump is an electrically powered 4.2kW water pump.
   [0035]          The water pump is mounted beneath the visible aerator components and
25 beneath the surface of the lake L. It is envisaged that the pump could operate at any
   practical depth, although the generally envisaged pump depth would be 1 to 2 metres
   below the water surface. The pump is fluidly connected to a water inlet, which is also
   located beneath the surface of the lake L.
   SPEC-926709.doc

                                                  6
   [0036]          In use, the pump pumps water from the lake through the water inlet, which
   then splits and flows into each of four separate water delivery paths 14, 16, 18, 20
   towards each of the four respective aerated water outlets (or jets) 24, 26, 28, 30. The
   outlets 24, 26, 28, 30 are horizontally orientated. The water delivery paths 14, 16, 18,
 5 20 are constructed from stainless steel pipes (316 grade stainless steel may be
   used). Although sections of the pipe defining the water delivery paths 14, 16, 18, 20
   are visible, much of the pipework is housed within the stainless steel housing 22, and
   therefore not visible. The housing 22 may be manufactured from 316 grade stainless
   steel.
10 [0037]          Each of the aerated water outlets 24, 26, 28, 30 is direction adjustable,
   such that the flow direction of aerated water W exiting each outlet 24, 26, 28, 30 may
   be selected, as desired. Direction adjustability of the outlets 24, 26, 28, 30 is
   advantageous, because it can be used to generate a mild whirlpool effect in the water
   W surrounding the aerator 10. This can further enhance the aeration of the water, and
15 reduce water stagnation. The outlets 24, 26, 28, 30 may also be adjusted to create an
   ornamental effect or other visual display, if desired.
   [0038]          It is envisaged that the aerated water exiting the outlets 24, 26, 28, 30
   would do so at very high pressure. The surface aeration effect of the aerated water
   may extend from, say, 5 to 40 metres from the outlets 24, 26, 28, 30.
20 [0039]          The aerated water delivery system 12 also includes a dedicated air delivery
   path 32, 34, 36, 38 for each of the water delivery paths 14, 16, 18, 20. The air delivery
   paths 32, 34, 36, 38 are constructed from stainless steel pipes (316 grade stainless
   steel may be used). The vertically orientated inlet 40, 42, 44, 46 of each air delivery
   path 32, 34, 36, 38 is clearly visible, although much of the pipework defining the air
25 delivery paths 32, 34, 36, 38 is housed within the housing 22 and so is not visible.
   [0040]          Each air delivery path 32, 34, 36, 38 feeds into an associated water
   delivery path 14, 16, 18, 20 through a respective air delivery port. The air delivery
   ports are provided at an appropriate location in the water delivery paths 32, 34, 36, 38
   between the water inlet and the aerated water outlets 24, 26, 28, 30. The air delivery
30 ports are hidden within the housing 22.

   [0041]          In the illustrated aerator 10, water feeds into one side of a T-section valve;
   and air (which is entrained from the associated air delivery path by the flowing water)
   feeds into the other side of the T-section valve. The water and air then mix and flow
   from the valve as aerated water, which ultimately flows from the associated aerated
 5 water outlet 24, 26, 28, 30
   [0042]          Each of the water delivery paths 14, 16, 18, 20 between the water inlet and
   air delivery port includes a respective water delivery path venturi (not visible) for
   generating an increase of flow rate of water through the water delivery paths 14, 16,
   18, 20.
10 [0043]          Each air delivery path 32, 34, 36, 38 includes a respective air delivery path
   venturi (not visible) for generating an increase in the flow rate of air through the air
   delivery paths 32, 34, 36, 38. It is to be appreciated that the applicant's delivery
   system is designed such that air is entrained into the respective water flow paths 14,
   16, 18, 20 via the respective air delivery ports.
15 [0044]          The aerator 10 includes a flotation device 50 for, in use, supporting the
   aerated water delivery system 12 in an operating position in the lake (or other body of
   water).
   [0045]          The flotation device 50 (in the form of a pontoon) supports the water pump
   below the surface of the lake. The vertical distance between the pump and the
20 flotation device is adjustable.
   [0046]          The flotation device 50 includes a pair of elongate watertight, polyethylene
   floats 52, 54. The floats are connected together in a parallel and spaced arrangement
   by a support (or mounting) frame 56. The frame 56 is preferably 316 grade stainless
   steel. The aerated water delivery system 12 is mounted to the support frame 56.
25 [0047]          The floats 52, 54 in the lustrated embodiment are 2000 mm in length and
   300 mm in diameter, which keeps most of the aerator components clear of the water
   by around 75 mm. It is to be appreciated that the material used in the construction of
   the floats 52, 54 may be selected as desired. Similarly, the shape and dimensions of
   the floats 52, 54 may be varied, if required.

                                                     8
   [0048]         A tethering line(s) (not visible) is provided for retaining the aerator 10 in a
   desired position on the lake.
   [0049]         Tests    have  indicated    that the    illustrated aerator   10 will  process
   approximately 1.25 megalitres a day through the submersible pump, and introduce
 5 approximately an additional 750,000 litres of air with the delivered fluids, which results
   in sufficient oxygen levels to sustain biological life forms.
   [0050]         The unique design of the aerator 10 using the previously described 4.2kW
   pump will have similar performance capabilities of existing aerator designs having
   pumps of up to 22kW. Thus, the present invention potentially provides a significant
10 saving in electricity costs, and provides a greatly reduced carbon footprint. The
   aerator 10 is also significantly more cost effective to manufacture than existing
   aerators.
   [0051]         The applicant has performed extensive research and development on the
   design of the aerator 10. The applicants developed a spreadsheet (not shown) that
15 uses flow data to calculate oxygen throughput for the aerator 10, as outlined below.
                  Input Data
                  Air velocity:            6 m/s
                  Air input diameter:      40 mm

   SPEC-926709.do

                                                     9
                   Mass flow 02:      32.43147 kg 0 2/hr
                   Cost of 02 input:        7.721779 kg 0 2/kWhr
   [0052]          The above data is in respect of only one of the outlets 24, 26, 28, 30, rather
   than for the combined total of all four outlets.
 5 [0053]          The research and development undertaken by the applicant also included
   clean water re-oxygenation experiments following a technique outlined by the
   American Society of Civil Engineering (ASCE). This technique is widely recognised
   and finds widespread application in industry.
   [0054]          The applicant's aerator 10 was tested at their 1000 litre facility. The re
10 oxygenation curve is illustrated in Figure 3. The semi-log of this data allows an
   estimate of the oxygen transfer coefficient as illustrated in Figure 4.
   [0055]          Testing has shown that the performance from a single water outlet (or jet)
   24, 26, 28, 30 can provide a mass flow of oxygen of around 32.43147 kg/hr.
   Therefore in its complete form with all four outlets 24, 26, 28, 30, the aerator 10 has
15 an oxygen output of around 129.72588 kg/hr. This output exceeds performance rates
   of other existing aerator designs.
   [0056]          The simplified design of the aerator 10 when compared to existing aerators
   results in potentially significantly less maintenance. It is envisaged that the aerator 10
   will only require an annual oil check in the pump housing.
20 [0057]          Moreover, the aerator 10 is relatively compactly designed and light weight,
   such that it is possible to move it relatively easily using a small crane, as compared to
   the need for a larger crane when moving existing aerator designs. Indeed, the aerator
   10 is compact enough to transport on a small trailer, which is not possible for existing
   designs.
25 [0058]          Finally, it is to be understood that various alterations, modifications and/or
   additions may be introduced into the construction and arrangement of the parts
   previously described without departing from the spirit or ambit of this invention.
