       A method of forming a coating on a substrate is provided comprising
forming a lignin solution by at least partially dissolving lignin in a solvent,

substrate to a treatment selected from the group consisting of a heat treatment
and an acid treatment. The coating provides for improved waterproofing and/or
strengthening of the substrate.

                    LIGNIN-BASED WATERPROOF COATING
                           FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]      The invention relates to the field of coating technologies. More
particularly, this invention relates to a method of forming a waterproof coating
on a substrate and to compositions for use therein.
                       BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]      Any reference to background art herein is not to be construed as an
admission that such art constitutes common general knowledge in Australia or
elsewhere.
[0003]      The use of waterproof coatings on a range of substrates is common
in a wide range of applications. One example is the waterproofing of paper and
paperboard products used in the food packaging and transportation industries.
It is important in these applications to protect the food from the ingress of
moisture which may affect the quality of the food or even cause spoiling.
Waterproof coatings also preserve the packaging's structural integrity in high
moisture environments.
[0004]      Existing waterproof coatings of card and corrugated paper packaging
are often made from wax which may provide an effective barrier to water but
which are difficult to recycle. Other waterproof coatings are known which
contain a range of polymeric hydrophobic components along with fillers and the
like. These fillers and other agents are typically required to place the paper
substrate into a suitable state for attachment of the actual waterproofing agent.
This requires a delicate balance in the formulation whereby pH and temperature
conditions are optimal for all of the individual components to exert their effect.
[0005]      These fillers and other preparatory agents are often less than
satisfactory in their performance and overall the coating formulations become
complicated in terms of the number of components required to achieve the

                                            2
effect. The presence of these multi-functional components also increases the
cost to the consumer.
[0006]       WO 2000/028141 teaches a composition and method for treating
paper products with a ligninosulfonate/kraft lignin blend formulation in a mixture
of solvents to improve strength and humidity resistance, described as the
preservation of strength in a high humidity environment. The process relies on
penetration of the formulation into the paper to bond the fibres together with
optional use of sugars to help penetration of the lignin and optional heating.
WO 2000/028141 does not provide for water barrier properties even though
some incidental improvement in initial water resistance is observed. It also
requires very high coating weights of formulation to achieve adequate
penetration and has a significant amount of undissolved solids in the
formulation which is undesirable.
[0007]       RU2076125 (Dejneko) generates an oxidised lignin and then
employs this as a binder for wood fibres which undergo a hot pressing to form
the final particle board. While some water resistance is claimed this process
primarily employs lignin as a binder and does not result in a useful water
barrier. It also relies on unnecessarily complicated pre-treatment steps for the
lignin.
[0008]       It would be useful to provide for a method of forming a waterproof
coating on a substrate, including a paper or a paper product, which is simple,
effective and recyclable.
                           OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
[0009]       It is an aim of this invention to provide for a waterproof coating for a
substrate which overcomes or ameliorates one or more of the disadvantages or
problems described above, or which at least provides a useful alternative.
[0010]       Other preferred objects of the present invention will become
apparent from the following description.

                                           3
                            SUMMARY OF INVENTION
[0011]       According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a
method of forming a coating on a substrate including the steps of:
              (a)   forming a lignin solution by at least partially dissolving a lignin
                    in a solvent;
              (b)   coating the lignin solution onto the substrate; and
              (c)   exposing the lignin coated substrate to a treatment selected
                    from the group consisting of a heat treatment and an acid
                    treatment,
        to thereby form the coating on the substrate.
[0012]       Preferably, the lignin is obtained from soda, soda-anthraquinone,
organsolv pulping liquors, Kraft black liquor, lignocellulosics or lignin containing
biomass materials from any plant origin. Lignosulfonates recovered from the
spent pulping liquids (red or brown liquor) of sulfite pulping may be useful but
are less preferred. Lignin-based compounds obtained by chemical modification
of lignins sourced from pulping and separation processes, for example the
removal of sulfonate groups form lignosulfonates, may also be used.
[0013]       The lignin solution comprises lignin as the major waterproofing
agent. In one embodiment, the lignin solution consists essentially of lignin as
the active waterproofing agent. In one embodiment, the lignin solution
comprises lignin as the sole waterproofing agent.
[0014]       The lignin solution comprises lignin as the major strength enhancing
agent. In one embodiment, the lignin solution consists essentially of lignin as
the active strength enhancing agent. In one embodiment, the lignin solution
comprises lignin as the sole strength enhancing agent
[0015]       In one embodiment, the lignin solution substantially comprises lignin
as the only non-solvent component.

                                          4
[0016]      A second aspect of the invention resides in a composition which
comprises lignin, as the major active component, at least partially dissolved in a
solvent.
[0017]      In one embodiment, the lignin is substantially completely dissolved in
the solvent.
[0018]      The composition may be as described for the first aspect. Preferably,
the solvent is such that an alkaline solution is formed.
[0019]      In one embodiment, the composition consists essentially of lignin, as
the active component.
[0020]      In a further embodiment, the composition consists of lignin, as the
active component.
[0021]      The composition may further comprise a deodorising agent and/or a
plasticiser, as described for the first aspect.
[0022]      According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a use of
the composition of the second aspect to form a coating on a substrate.
[0023]      The use will be as described in each statement made in relation to
the first aspect as if each of those statements was recited explicitly for the third
aspect.
[0024]      A fourth aspect of the invention resides in a substrate comprising a
coating formed by the method of the first aspect.
[0025]      The substrate may be as described for the first aspect.
[0026]      The various features and embodiments of the present invention,
referred to in individual sections above apply, as appropriate, to other sections,
mutatis mutandis. Consequently features specified in one section may be
combined with features specified in other sections as appropriate.
[0027]      Further features and advantages of the present invention will
become apparent from the following detailed description.

                DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0036]      The present invention is predicated, at least in part, on the finding
that a highly effective waterproof and/or strengthening coating can be formed

                                          6
on paper by, in certain embodiments, coating the paper with a simple solution
of lignin. In further embodiments, the coating can be formed with lignin and
glycerol. The coated lignin is then subjected to either a thermal annealing step
or to an acid treatment step. Both of these steps result in a transformation of
the lignin coating, when dried, to form a glossy shiny coating which shows
commercially useful levels of water resistance. It has not been appreciated in
the art that such an effective waterproof and/or strengthening coating could be
achieved using lignin as the major or sole active waterproofing                and
strengthening agent.
[0037]      Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used
herein have the same meaning as would be commonly understood by those of
ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.
[0038]      As used herein, the term "lignin" refers generally to lignin-based
compounds or oligomers/polymers that are insoluble or only sparingly soluble in
water but for the major part soluble in aqueous alkaline or, at least partially
soluble in mildly acidic solutions. Lignosulfonates may also be used in the
present process, with modifications, but are less preferred. Oxidised lignins are
also less preferred.
[0039]      As used herein, the term "waterproof" or "waterproofing" is
synonymous with "water-resistant" and is used to indicate an improvement in
the waterproof or water-resistant properties of the substrate to which the lignin
coating is applied. These terms are not to be restricted to requiring that the
coating forms a water impermeable barrier under all conditions.
[0040]      In one embodiment, the term "waterproof" or "waterproofing" is used
to indicate that the coating, after appropriate heat or acid treatment, forms a
barrier which substantially prevents the ingress of water into the substrate in an
industry standard Cobb 30 test when the substrate is contacted with liquid
water.

                                          7
[0041]     The phrase "active waterproofing agent", as used herein, refers to a
component of a solution, composition or formulation which, after the appropriate
coating and post-coating treatment steps, actively forms a barrier to resist the
ingress of water into the substrate.
[0042]     As used herein, the term "strengthening" refers to an increase in the
physical strength and/or resilience of the substrate after the coating of the
invention has been formed and treated therein compared with those
characteristics of the substrate prior to coating. The increase in strength can be
determined by standard industry means such as, for example, ring crush testing
performed according to set international standards.
[0043]     The phrase "consists essentially of", as used herein, means that the
element or component which follows forms the main active in the solution,
composition, formulation or coating. In particular it is used to mean that the
element or component which follows forms greater than 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%,
80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% by weight of the active
waterproofing and/or strength enhancing agents. In one embodiment, the
phrase is used to mean that the element or component which follows is the only
active waterproofing and/or strength enhancing agent and any other elements
or components which are present, such as deodorizing agents or plasticisers,
are not active waterproofing and/or strength enhancing components. It is
preferred that the waterproof and/or strengthening capability of the final coating
is substantially provided by lignin alone.
[0044]     The phrase "consists of", as used herein, means that the element or
component which follows is the only active waterproofing and/or strength
enhacing component in the solution, composition, formulation or coating. Other
non-solvent elements or components may only be present in trace amounts.
[0045]     In a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of
forming a coating on a substrate including the steps of:

                                          8
              (a)  forming a lignin solution by at least partially dissolving a lignin
                   in a solvent;
              (b)  coating the lignin solution onto the substrate; and
              (c)  exposing the lignin coated substrate to a treatment selected
                   from the group consisting of a heat treatment and an acid
                   treatment,
        to thereby form the coating on the substrate.
[0046]       In one embodiment, the coating is a waterproof coating.
[0047]       In one embodiment, the coating is a water resistant coating.
[0048]       In one embodiment, the coating is a strengthening coating.
[0049]       In one embodiment, the substrate is selected from the group
consisting of lignocellulosic substrates, lignocellulosic derived substrates,
cellulosic substrates and cellulosic derived substrates.
[0050]       Suitably, the substrate is selected from the group consisting of a
paper or a paper product, a wood or wood veneer, a cotton or other natural
fibre fabric, moulded pulp and moulded fibre materials, sugar cane bagasse
based materials, tapioca-based materials, corn starch-based materials and
biomass composite materials. A range of paper and paper products, such as
paperboard, can be coated with the lignin compositions of the present
inventions. Any paper-based substrate which is required to have water-resistant
or improved physical strength characteristics could be coated in accordance
with the present invention and such substrates would be well known to those in
the art.
[0051]       The substrate is a non-metal substrate.
[0052]       Preferably, the substrate is a formed substrate prior to coating by
which it is intended that the coating is not applied during manufacture or
formation of the substrate when the physical components of the substrate have

                                          9
not yet been bound together. In the case of paper or moulded wood fibre
products, by way of example, this means that the coating is applied to the fully
formed substrate rather than being integrated into the fibres prior to moulding to
act as a binder. The fully formed substrate refers to the product or sheet onto
which the coating is applied and it will be appreciated that this substrate itself
may then become internalised as part of a larger complex product. The present
coatings thus substantially sit on top of the formed substrate and do not
penetrate internally to any significant degree to impart the waterproofing and/or
strengthening properties. The formed substrate includes a substrate, such as a
paper substrate, which has not yet undergone converting operations but is still
considered to be a formed substrate.
[0053]      Thus, in one embodiment, the coating step is a coating of the lignin
solution onto substantially only an external surface of the substrate. The coating
is not performed on any element of the substrate which will become an internal
part of the formed substrate. In one embodiment, the method is a method of
forming a coating which remains on substantially only an external surface of the
substrate. For the sake of clarity, and as mentioned above, the substrate which
has the coating sitting on an external surface thereof (and not internalised
within to any significant extent) may become an internal part of a larger product
but the coating still only sits on the surface of the substrate onto which it was
actually coated. For example, a cardboard substrate may be coated on one
side and the carboard then used as an outer wall of a corrugated cardboard
product having at least two outer walls and an inner fluted layer. The coated
side of the substrate may be positioned to face internally into the fluted layer.
Thus, while the substrate itself has a coated layer facing internally into a larger
product the coating of the present invention does not to any substantial extent
become internalised within the substrate per se.
[0054]      The solution may be a mildly acidic, neutral or alkaline solution.
Preferably, the lignin solution is an alkaline lignin solution. The alkaline solution
may be an ammonia solution, an alkali metal hydroxide or carbonate solution or

                                        10
an alkaline earth metal hydroxide or carbonate solution. Preferred alkaline
solutions will be those which are volatile and so are easily removed from the
coating with minimal or no residue left behind to potentially interfere with the
coating.
[0055]      Preferably, the solvent is an aqueous ammonia solution. Ammonia
has proven to be particularly effective in dissolving the lignin to form an
appropriate solution for coating. Further, ammonia is volatile and so it does not
leave a problematic residue on drying. However, any alkaline solution which is
capable of dissolving the lignin within a reasonable volume and subsequently
being easily removed may be appropriate. Alkalis which may damage the
substrate or which will leave a salt residue upon evaporation which may
interfere with the waterproof and/or strength enhancing coating are to be
avoided.
[0056]      Preferably, the lignin is obtained by separation, for example by
acidification, from soda, soda-anthraquinone or organsolv pulping liquors. The
lignin can also      be obtained    by known    methods of extraction from
lignocellulosics or lignin containing biomass materials from any plant origin.
Lignin obtained by separation, for example by acidification, from Kraft black
liquor may also be used. Lignosulfonates recovered from the spent pulping
liquids (red or brown liquor) of sulfite pulping may be useful but are less
preferred. Lignin-based compounds obtained by chemical modification of lignins
sourced from pulping processes, for example the removal of sulfonate groups
form lignosulfonates, may also be used.
[0057]      In one embodiment the lignin is a natural, unmodified or non
derivatised lignin.
[0058]      In one preferred embodiment, the lignin is a soda pulp lignin.
[0059]      In one embodiment, the lignin is not an oxidised lignin.
[0060]      In one embodiment, the lignin is not a lignosulfonate lignin.

                                             11
[0061]       In a further embodiment, the lignin is not a lignosulfonate lignin from
sulfite pulping.
[0062]       In yet a further embodiment, the lignin is not a lignosulfonate formed
by sulfite pulping and known to be water soluble.
[0063]       The lignin solution comprises lignin as the major waterproofing
and/or strengthening agent. In one embodiment, the lignin solution consists
essentially of lignin as the active waterproofing and/or strengthening agent. In
one embodiment, the lignin solution comprises lignin as the sole waterproofing
and/or strengthening agent.
[0064]       This is a key difference between the present coating compositions
and those of the prior art. Some prior art coating compositions may use lignin
as one of the components but it is always in combination with other active
agents including fillers and waterproofing agents of different classes. Indeed,
most often the lignin which is present in these compositions is not actually there
because of any inherent waterproofing or strengthening properties but rather is
itself acting as a filler. In contrast, the present inventors have discovered that an
extremely effective waterproof barrier and/or a consequent increase in the
physical strength of the substrate can be formed using a composition in which
lignin is the only active waterproofing and strengthening agent. In fact, other
than optional deodorising treatments, which may be required to address any
inherent odour from the lignin, and very small amounts of optional plasticisers,
lignin may be the only component which is present in the compositions.
[0065]       In one embodiment, the lignin solution does not comprise a
component selected from the group consisting of a filler, a cationic polymer, a
cross-linker and an amphiphilic polymer.
[0066]       In one embodiment, the lignin solution substantially comprises lignin
as the only non-solvent component. This is the simplest form of the present
waterproofing and/or strengthening compositions wherein lignin is dissolved in a
solvent, preferably in an ammonia solution. No further agents or additives are

                                          12
required for this to be an effective coating once it has been suitably thermally
annealed or exposed to a pH reduction (acid treatment).
[0067]       It is an advantage of the present invention that only lignin is used as
the active waterproofing and/or strengthening agent and so the coating
treatment relies on renewable resources and is entirely and easily recyclable.
[0068]       In one embodiment, the lignin solution substantially comprises lignin
as the only non-solvent component.
[0069]       It is an advantage of the present invention that the use of,
particularly, an ammonia solution results in substantially complete dissolution of
the lignin. In WO 00/28141 the use of a mixed solvent to address the varying
solubilities of the lignins used, particularly at the higher lignin/solvent ratios,
means the lignin is only partly dissolved and a considerable portion of the lignin
is present as a particulate suspension. In the present lignin solution the lignin is
substantially completely or predominately dissolved thereby providing for an
improved finish in the dried coating. In one embodiment, the lignin is
substantially completely dissolved in the solvent.
[0070]       In one embodiment, the lignin solution, prior to coating, has an
undissolved solids content of less than 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1.0%, 0.5%. 0.25% or
0.1% by weight of the solution.
[0071]       In an embodiment, the lignin solution may comprise, in a % by weight
of the solution amount, lignin in between 10 to 40%, 10 to 35%, 10 to 30%, 10
to 25%, 15 to 40%, 15 to 35%, 15 to 30% or 15 to 25%, inclusive of about 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 or 24%.
[0072]       In one embodiment, the lignin solution may further comprise an
agent selected from the group consisting of sugars and sugar alcohols. Sugars
may be selected from the group consisting of monosaccharides, disaccharides
and polysaccharide sugars. Sucrose is one favoured example of a disaccharide
but a wide range of such sugars are known to those skilled in the art. In one
embodiment the sugar alcohol is a polyol is selected from the group consisting

                                              13
of ethylene glycol, glycerol, erythritol, threitol, arabitol, xylitol, ribitol, mannitol,
sorbitol, galactitol, fucitol, iditol, inositol, volemitol, isomalt, maltitol and lactitol.
[0073]      In one embodiment, the lignin solution may further comprise a C2 to
C12 polyol. This is inclusive of C2 to C12, C2 to C10, C2 to C8, C2 to C6, C2 to C4,
C3 to C12, C3to C10, C3 to C8, C3to C6, inclusive of C2, C3, C4,      C5 and C6 polyols.
[0074]      In a preferred embodiment, the polyol is glycerol. It has been found
that the use of glycerol, above a certain % by weight amount, surprisingly allows
the annealing temperature employed in the heat treatment step to be
significantly reduced compared to that required after coating with a solution
containing lignin alone to achieve the same water barrier and/or strengthening
efficacy. This is counterintuitive as, although glycerol may be used as a
plasticiser in small amounts in certain applications, it would be expected that
higher levels of glycerol would actually increase water absorption due to the
presence of multiple hydroxyl groups. It would also be expected that higher
levels of glycerol would result in a coating which would be greasy to the touch
and easily removed and hence reduce any gains in physical strength of the
substrate. The present inventors have found this is not the case and while the
addition of glycerol is not essential it has benefits in reducing the required
annealing temperature and providing for an improved water resistant and/or
strengthening coating.
[0075]      While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the inventors
postulate that upon heating some of the glycerol reacts with ammonia to form
amides. These amides are more volatile than glycerol itself and depending on
the temperature at the paper surface may decompose. The formation of the
amides and their subsequent decomposition are exothermic reactions which
serve to increase the temperature at the paper surface. The reaction with
ammonia also decreases the pH and drives the glass transition event in the
same manner as acid annealing and higher temperature annealing do.

                                        14
[0076]      The polyol, preferably glycerol, may be present in a % by weight
amount of the lignin solution of between 0.1 to 35%, including 0.1 to 30%, 0.1 to
25% and 0.1 to 20%. In one embodiment, the polyol, preferably glycerol, is
present at 1 to 35%, including 1 to 30%, 1 to 25% and 1 to 20% or 5 to 35%,
including 5 to 30%, 5 to 25% and 8 to 20% or 8 to 35%, including 8 to 30%, 8 to
25% and 8 to 20%. In one embodiment, the polyol, preferably glycerol, is
present at 10 to 35%, including 10 to 30%, 10 to 25% and 10 to 20%. In one
embodiment, the polyol, preferably glycerol, is present at 15 to 35%, including
15 to 30%, 15 to 25% and 15 to 20%.
[0077]      In one embodiment, the lignin solution substantially comprises lignin,
glycerol and a plasticiser as the only non-solvent components.
[0078]      The plasticiser may be selected from the group consisting of a
natural or synthetic latex, a polyether, a glycol, a dicarboxylic or tricarboxylic
ester, a phthalate, an alkyl citrate and an acetylated monoglyceride.
[0079]      The plasticiser may be a non-glycerol plasticiser.
[0080]      The plasticiser may be present in a % by weight amount of the lignin
solution of between 0.1 to 10%, including 01. to 8%, 0.1 to 7%, 0.1 to 6%, 01. to
5%, 0.1 to 4%, 0.1 to 3%, preferably 1.0 to 5%, more preferably 2 to 4% and
even more preferably about 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5%. The plasticiser assists in
improving the physical properties of the coating and is not essential to achieve
a water resistant and/or strengthening coating and is not an active
waterproofing or strengthening component itself.
[0081]      In embodiments, the lignin solution, at the time of coating, has a
viscosity of between 60 to 4500 mPa s. Preferably, the viscosity of the lignin
solution at coating is between about 100 to 4000 mPas, more preferably
between about 200 to 3000 mPa's, even more preferably between about 300 to
2000 mPas, still more preferably between about 350 to 1500 mPa s and more
preferably still between about 350 to about 1200 mPa s.

                                          15
[0082]      The present inventors have found that the waterproofing and/or
strengthening properties of the coating do not depend critically upon the
viscosity of the solution and a wide range of viscosities can still result in an
effective waterproof and/or strengthening coating. This is particularly so with the
thermal annealing treatment as even very dilute, low viscosity solutions will lose
water and pass through a more concentrated and supersaturated state. With
the acid treatment it may be preferable that more concentrated solutions are
employed. In practical terms, industry standards dictate that higher viscosity
solutions are preferable as the current coating machines in wide use operate
optimally with a solution having a viscosity in the 350 to 1200 mPa s range. For
this reason this is a preferred viscosity range purely because it provides
advantages in operational adaptability.
[0083]      Suitably, the pH of the lignin solution at coating is between about 5.0
to 12.0 or between about 6.5 to 11.0, preferably between about 7.0 to 9.5, more
preferably between about 7.5 to 9.0 and even more preferably between about
8.0 to 8.9 including about 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7 or 8.8. Lignin is soluble
under alkaline conditions and so standard bases, such as ammonia, which
operate in the general pH 8.0 to 12.0 range are ideal for solubilising the lignin
and are preferred herein. However, partial solubility can be achieved with some
lignin forms under mildly acidic or neutral conditions. Although all of the lignin
may not dissolve which may result in some granulation in the final coating it will
be appreciated that it may be useful in specific applications to create coatings
of increased roughness for grip related advantages (such as compressive creep
analysis for stacking boxes in chilled or humid conditions) using this lower pH
range.
[0084]      The coating step may be performed by drawdown coating, rod
coating, spin coating, dip coating, Meyer rod coating, roller coating, spray
coating, brush coating or air-knife coating. The spray and brush applications
may be particularly suitable for wood and wood veneer coatings.

                                          16
[0085]      Preferably, the coating step is performed by rod coating as is
commonly practised in the paper products manufacturing industry.
[0086]      There are a wide range of coating methodologies and related
technology which are well known in the art of coating with many commercial
solutions available. It is an advantage of the present invention that the coating
compositions are suitable for use with standard industry accepted coating
technologies and so minimal or no modification to existing hardware is required.
[0087]      The weight of the coating is between about 1 to 35 GSM, 2 to 35
GSM or 5 to 35 GSM. Preferably, the weight of the coating is between about 5
to 30 GSM or 5 to 25 GSM. In one embodiment, the coating weight is 6 to 35
GSM, 6 to 30 GSM, 6 to 25 GSM or 6 to 20 GSM. In a further embodiment, the
coating weight is 8 to 35 GSM, 8 to 30 GSM, 8 to 25 GSM or 8 to 20 GSM.
[0088]      It is a further advantage of the present invention, and a result of the
manner in which the process works, being that the coating substantially remains
on the external coated surface of the substrate and does not to any extent
resulting in a functional change to the substrate impregnate the substrate
material itself, that relatively low coating weights are sufficient to achieve
commercially useful water resistant and/or strengthening properties. In the
examples in WO 2000/28141 the coating weights increase from 38 GSM to 281
GSM, and in one case the weight of the treated paper is increased by 70 %.
This is as a result of the different mechanism of action whereby WO
2000/28141 relies on substantial impregnation of their composition into the
paper article to achieve the desired improvement in strength. The present
method employs a typical coating weight of less than 20 GSM and does not rely
on, and in fact does not achieve, impregnation of the substrate to give the
enhanced strength characteristics.
[0089]      In one embodiment, the present method results in an increase in
weight of the substrate of between 0.1 to 30%, 0.1 to 25%, 0.1 to 20%, 0.1 to

                                          17
15% or 0.1 to 10%. Common weight increases observed in paper substrates
using the present method are between 5 % to 10 %.
[0090]       In one embodiment, the coating step is not performed under elevated
pressures being those above atmospheric pressure. The coating step is
preferably carried out at atmospheric pressure. It is still a further advantage of
the present inventive method that high pressures do not need to be generated
for a curing step. Many prior art processes employ such an energy intensive
high pressure approach which requires additional infrastructure and so
increases costs. The present method simply uses existing coating technology
under standard conditions to apply a simple lignin solution to the substrate.
[0091]       The heat treatment is a thermal annealing to allow the lignin to
undergo the required physical transformation to provide the waterproof coating.
[0092]       For most lignins, and in particular those discussed above as suitable
lignin sources for use in the present process the heat treatment is exposure to
temperatures selected from the group consisting of temperatures greater than
70*C,80*C,900C,1000C,1100C,1200C,1300C,1400C,150C,160C,170*C,
1800C, 1900C, 2000C, 210*C or 2200C. An upper temperature limit which may
be combined with any one of these lower limits to form a suitable range would
be the temperature at which the substrate becomes heat damaged or ignites. In
one embodiment, this upper temperature limit may be either 2300C or 2400C.
[0093]       In one embodiment wherein the lignin solution substantially
comprises lignin as the only non-solvent component or comprises a sugar or
sugar alcohol, such as glycerol, and/or a plasticiser in less than 10% by weight
of the lignin solution, the heat treatment may be exposure to a heat source at a
temperature between about 1600C to about 2300C, preferably between about
1700C to about 2300C, more preferably between about 1800C to 2250C.
[0094]       In one embodiment wherein the lignin solution comprises lignin and
further comprises a sugar or sugar alcohol, such as glycerol, at greater than
10%, preferably greater than 15% by weight of the lignin solution, the heat

                                          18
treatment may be exposure to a temperature of between about 900C to about
2300C, preferably between about 1000C to about 2300C, more preferably
between about 110*C to 2250C.
[0095]      The heat treatment, or thermal annealing, step is one potential route
to a waterproof and/or strengthening coating using the present method, the
other being the acid treatment step. Without wishing to be bound by any
particular theory, the inventors postulate that the thermal annealing and acid
treatment steps represent a transition in the form of the lignin from a
supersaturated state (glass state) in the lignin solution to a crystalline state
(presenting a shiny finish on the substrate) and this can be achieved by either
heating to suitable temperatures or by rapidly lowering the pH. Thus, the two
differing approaches of high temperature or acid treatment effectively achieve
the same outcome in terms of the critical transition of the lignin. If this transition
is not achieved then the coating will not be an effective waterproof barrier
and/or will not provide the desired improved strength. For example, in testing
when the thermal annealing was carried out at lower temperatures, without the
addition of significant quantities of glycerol, then a coated paper with a powdery
finish, which could be largely removed by gentle rubbing, was formed. This was
not an effective waterproof coating and demonstrates that if the critical
transition temperature (for the thermal annealing approach) is not reached then
the lignin present on the substrate cannot transform to become an effective
barrier to water.
[0096]      For prior art references which employ lignin as a component in a
waterproof coating the lignin cannot be contributing to the waterproofing
properties to any significant extent unless a minimum temperature of 1300C,
and preferably at least 1600C (for coatings comprising lignin with little or no
glycerol) or of 800C, preferably 900C (for coatings comprising lignin and
significant amounts of glycerol as defined above), is employed or a suitable acid
treatment step is performed. The upper temperature limit is defined by the
temperature which the substrate can withstand before becoming damaged.

                                          19
[0097]      It is an advantage of the present invention that the heat treatment
step can be completed in a matter of seconds when carried out in industrial
heating equipment such as is commonly employed in paper making. In one
embodiment, the heat treatment step is complete in less than 10 min, 6 min, 5
min, 4 min, 3 min, 2 min, 1 min or 30 seconds.
[0098]      The acid treatment may comprise contacting the lignin coating with
an acid having a pH below 4.0 or below 3.5. Preferably, the pH is about 3.5 or
below with a lower limit being 0 or 1.
[0099]      The acid may be an inorganic (mineral) acid or an organic acid. It is
preferred that the acid is a volatile acid. This allows for the easy removal of the
acid without leaving residues on the substrate or within the coating. Weak acids
are preferred. It is highly preferred that the acid is a volatile weak acid, such as
acetic acid. In one embodiment, the acid may be selected from the group
consisting of acetic acid, formic acid, phosphoric acid and citric acid. The acid
may be diluted or used neat. If diluted then a miscible solvent such as ethanol,
ethyl acetate, glycerol or water may be used. The choice of solvent will depend
on the subsequent exposure of the coating to any naked flames during drying
and the ensuing safety issues raised. In this regard, glycerol may have an
advantage in reducing potential flammability.
[00100]     When the lignin solution for the coating is a mildly acidic solution
then it may be preferred that the treatment step is a heat treatment (thermal
annealing) step, as previously described, rather than an acidic treatment.
[00101]     The acid may be sprayed onto the coating, or otherwise applied, to
effect the transition in the lignin to form an effective waterproof barrier and/or
providing enhanced strength characteristics. Particularly, the acid may be
applied in an atomized spray which produces an even contact across the
coated substrate surface such that no pooling or run off of acid is observed.
[00102]     When the treatment is an acid treatment then the method may
further include the step of drying the lignin coating. The drying may be under

                                        20
ambient conditions or may involve heating or reduced pressure. This drying
step is simply to remove excess moisture and temperatures which would induce
thermal annealing are not necessary for drying.
[00103]    In embodiments, after the coating has dried the waterproof and/or
strengthening coating comprises lignin as the major active waterproofing and/or
strength enhancing constituent.
[00104]    The dried coating may comprise greater than 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%,
95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% by weight lignin.
[00105]    In a preferred embodiment, after the coating has dried the waterproof
and/or strengthening coating consists essentially of lignin as the active
waterproofing constituent.
[00106]    In one embodiment, after the lignin coating has dried the waterproof
and/or strengthening coating consists of lignin as the active waterproofing
constituent.
[00107]    As was described earlier, it is a unique advantage of the present
invention that an effective waterproof and/or strengthening coating can be
formed on a substrate purely by the use of lignin as the active waterproofing
and/or strengthening component in the coating and, specifically, by the
transformation of the lignin to form a waterproof and/or strengthening coating by
thermal annealing or acid treatment.
[00108]    In certain embodiments, the lignin solution may be treated with a
deodorising agent. The deodorising agent may be an oxidising agent or a
suitable absorbent. In one embodiment, the deodorising agent is selected from
the group consisting of activated carbon, ozone, hydrogen peroxide,
diatomaceous earth, activated clays, ion-exchange resins or silica gel. It may be
desirable to have a deodorising agent, such as activated carbon, when the
paper product being coated is used for food applications. Lignin has an
associated odour when applied in a coating such as those described presently.
In many applications this would not present any problems but if the paper

                                          21
product is in intimate contact with the food then it is possible the odour may be
imparted, to some extent, to the food. In such instances it is a simple matter of
using a known deodorising agent to contact or pre-treat the lignin composition.
The use of activated carbon in this manner is described in the experimental
section.
[00109]      In embodiments where the lignin solution comprises a deodorising
agent then it may be particularly desirable to add a plasticiser to the solution
prior to coating. A plasticiser is also useful, as described earlier, in the
embodiment wherein higher glycerol levels are incorporated into the lignin
solution (10% and above). By way of non-limiting example, the plasticiser may
be selected from the group consisting of a natural or synthetic latex, a
polyether, a glycol, a dicarboxylic or tricarboxylic ester, a phthalate, an alkyl
citrate and an acetylated monoglyceride. Other commercially available
plasticisers are well known in the art. It has been found that the use of
deodorising agents, such as activated carbon, can reduce the natural plasticity
of the lignin coating. To recover this loss in plasticity all that is required is the
addition into the alkaline lignin solution of a small quantity of a plasticiser such
as a latex. A representative amount for the plasticiser would be between 0.1 to
10%, including 01. to 8%, 0.1 to 7%, 0.1 to 6%, 01. to 5%, 0.1 to 4%, 0.1 to 3%,
preferably 1.0 to 5%, more preferably 2 to 4% and even more preferably about
2.5, 3.0 and 3.5%. of the coating composition. For most plasticisers, such as
latex, a range of 1 to 6%, preferably 1.5 to 5%, more preferably 2 to 4% and
even more preferably about 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5% is appropriate. The amount
required will depend upon the plasticising properties of the plasticiser used and
can be determined by straightforward trials. It is important to understand that
this relatively small amount of plasticiser does not substantially contribute to the
waterproofing and/or strengthening properties of the coating to any significant
extent. That is, the plasticiser is not considered an active waterproofing and/or
strengthening component of the present compositions or method.

                                         22
[00110]     A second aspect of the invention resides in a composition which
comprises lignin, as the major active component, at least partially dissolved in a
solvent.
[00111]     The composition may be as described for the first aspect. Preferably,
the solvent is an alkaline solution.
[00112]     The alkaline solution, pH, lignin type and source and other aspects of
the composition may be as described for the first aspect.
[00113]     The composition consists essentially of lignin, as the active
waterproofing and/or strengthening component. This means that it is the lignin
which is substantially responsible for the waterproof and/or strengthening
activity imparted by the composition.
[00114]     In a further embodiment, the waterproofing and/or strengthening
composition consists of lignin, as the active waterproofing and/or strengthening
component.
[00115]     The composition may further comprise or be contacted with a
deodorising agent and/or a plasticiser, as described for the first aspect.
[00116]     In one embodiment, the solvent is an aqueous ammonia solution.
[00117]     In one embodiment, the composition comprises between about 15%
to about 40% by weight lignin and about 60% to about 85% by weight ammonia
solution.
[00118]     In this embodiment, the composition preferably comprises between
about 25% to about 35% by weight lignin and about 65% to about 75% by
weight ammonia solution.
[00119]     In one embodiment, the composition further comprises and agent
selected from a sugar and a sugar alcohol. Apecific examples may be as
recited for the first aspect.

                                        23
[00120]      The sugar alcohol may be a polyol, preferably glycerol, and may be
present in a % by weight amount of the composition of between 0.1 to 35%,
including 0.1 to 30%, 0.1 to 25% and 0.1 to 20%. In one embodiment, the
polyol, preferably glycerol, is present at 1 to 35%, including 1 to 30%, 1 to 25%
and 1 to 20% or 5 to 35%, including 5 to 30%, 5 to 25% and 8 to 20% or 8 to
35%, including 8 to 30%, 8 to 25% and 8 to 20%. In one embodiment, the
polyol, preferably glycerol, is present at 10 to 35%, including 10 to 30%, 10 to
25% and 10 to 20%. In one embodiment, the polyol, preferably glycerol, is
present at 15 to 35%, including 15 to 30%, 15 to 25% and 15 to 20%.
[00121]      In one embodiment, the composition comprises the following in % by
weight amounts of the total composition:
         (a)    between about 10% to about 40% lignin;
         (b)    between about 35% to about 80% ammonia solution; and
         (c)    between about 5% to about 30% of a sugar or sugar alcohol.
[00122]      Preferably, in combination with any recited value of (b) or (c), the
lignin is present in between about 15% to about 35%, more preferably between
about 18% to about 30%, even more preferably between about 20% to about
27%.
[00123]      Suitably, in combination with any recited value of (a) or (c), the
ammonia solution is between about 40% to about 70%, preferably between
about 45% to about 65%, more preferably about 50% to about 60%.
[00124]      Preferably, in combination with any recited value of (a) or (b), the
sugar or sugar alcohol is between about 10% to about 25%, more preferably
between about 15% to about 25%.
[00125]      Preferably, the sugar or sugar alcohol is as described for the first
aspect. Most preferably it is glycerol.
[00126]      In one embodiment, the composition further comprises a plasticiser
as described for the first aspect. Preferably, the platsiciser is a latex.

                                         24
[00127]      In one embodiment, the composition comprises the plasticiser in a %
by weight amount of between about 0.1% to 5%, preferably 1.0% to about 4.0%
each of which ranges may be combined with any of those ranges cited above
for (a), (b) and (c).
[00128]      In one embodiment, the composition comprises the following in % by
weight amounts of the total composition:
        (a)     between about 18% to about 27% lignin;
        (b)     between about 50% to about 67% ammonia solution;
        (c)     between about 10% to about 25% glycerol; and
        (d)     between about 0.1% to about 4% latex.
[00129]      In one embodiment, the pH of the composition is between about 7.5
to 9.5, preferably between about 8.0 to about 9.0.
[00130]      In one embodiment, the composition will have an oven dried solids
content of between about 25 to 45%DS, preferably between about 27 to
40%DS.
[00131]      In one embodiment, the Brookfield's Viscosity of the composition is
between about 100 to 500, preferably between about 150 to about 400.
[00132]      According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a use of
the composition of the second aspect to form a coating on a substrate.
[00133]      The substrate may be as described for the first aspect.
[00134]      Such a coating is surprisingly water resistant and/or will provide
improved strength characteristics to the substrate, as will be seen in the
examples, given the fact that it is only lignin which is contributing to any
significant extent to the water resistance and/or strengthening properties.
[00135]      The use will be as described in each statement made in relation to
the first aspect as if each of those statements was recited explicitly for the third
aspect.

                                        25
[00136]    A fourth aspect of the invention resides in a substrate comprising a
coating formed by the method of the first aspect.
[00137]    The waterproof and/or strengthening coating may employ the
composition of the second aspect.
[00138]    The substrate may be as described for the first aspect.
                                 EXPERIMENTAL
General
[00139]    Two different lignin-based formulations were generated for use in the
following experiments. The first was a simple ammoniacal lignin solution
(LBCv1.0) and the second was a similar ammoniacal lignin solution but which
had been treated with activated carbon as a deodorising agent (LBCv1.1 +AC).
[00140]    The following protocols describe methodology to create formulations
of a specific target viscosity (ca. 1000-1200 mPa.s) within the laboratory by
batch in open vessels. This was achieved by first evaporating in an open
beaker to a concentrated state (Viscosity greater than 2000mPa.s
overshooting the end point - higher viscosity and lower pH) and then adding
ammonia to adjust 'up' to a target pH (8.4-5). By making the formulation in this
manner it is possible to consistently achieve the target viscosity.
[00141]    While this approach is suitable for the laboratory it may be preferable
at scale to employ the use of large stirred and heated reactors and partial
vacuum (12-16 mm Hg) to rationalise the formulation creation process - i.e.
evaporate under partial vacuum (and lower temperature) in a closed reactor
system to an end point. Through this work it has been determined that a wide
range of viscosities (as low as 80 mPa.s and as high as 4000 mPa.s) of alkaline
lignin solution will still act to form an effective barrier film if appropriately
annealed/acid treated.
Preparation of LBCv1.0

                                         26
[00142]     Weigh raw lignin (290g) and add ammonia solution (1 L 0.5 M NH3 )
into a vessel at least twice the final expected volume (to allow space for initial
foaming), creating a ca. 300 g lignin/kg 0.5 M NH3 solution. Mix by overhead
stirring using blade attachment at high speed (ca. 600 rpm) until formulation is
homogenous. Reduce stirring speed (ca. 200-300rpm) and blend (either by
magnetic or overhead stirring) within the vessel exposed to ambient conditions
and heated at 800C (by heating plate) for ca. 24hrs. Post 24hrs measure the pH
of the formulation. If pH is greater than 7.2 continue stirring and recheck every
1-2 hours. Once pH approaches neutral (ca. 7.2), formulation will begin to
thicken and appear 'toffee like'. This change may be rapid.
[00143]     The Brookfields Viscosity (BrViS) of a subsample should then be
measured to confirm if it is greater than 2000 mPa.s. If BrVis is too low continue
stirring and subsample every hour until BrVis within range (>2000 mPa.s). Once
formulation is within range adjust the pH to ca. 8.4-5 with neat NH3 (28-30%).
Check the BrVis which should be in the range of 1000-1200 mPa.s at this pH
(60rpm, spindle 3). This is the final formulation (LBCv1.0) which may be sealed
and preferably refrigerated until usage. Prior to usage ensure pH is within
preferred range (pH 8.4-5) and adjust if required (28% NH3). Check final BrVis
is within range (1000-1200 mPa.s).
[00144]      Note that foaming may be managed with the addition of aerosolised
ethanol or defoamer as required. Optionally, and as discussed above, the
reaction may take place in a sealed vessel capable of drawing a partial vacuum
(approx 12-16mm Hg) to remove volatile gases produced during stirring. In
addition the required stirring time at 800C can be significantly shortened using a
partial vacuum to under 2 hours. Experiments have shown a greater range of
pH's (i.e. less than 8.4-8.5) and lower viscosities (i.e. lower than 1000-1200
cps) also form an effective film and provide good water barriers so long as they
are appropriately annealed.

Preparation of LBCv1.1+AC
[00145]       Weigh a volume of Activated Carbon (AC) approximately to 1/3 (or
as low as 1/12) of the expected total final formulation volume and record weight
(i.e. if creating 1 kg of formulation place 333mL of AC into a percolation column
and record dry weight (ca. 165 g)). Wash AC with boiling milliQ H2 0 (0.45pm
filtered) and decant fines. Repeat until runoff from AC is clear. Drain as much
milliQ H2 0 as possible and transfer into a pre-weighed percolation column or
like vessel. Calculate wet AC weight and determine amount of trapped and
bound H2 0 (e.g. if final wet AC weight is 403 g then trapped/bound AC H2 0 is
ca. 238 g). Create ammonia solution (0.5M NH3) taking into consideration the
trapped/bound AC H2 0 (e.g. if 403 g) and reduce volume accordingly (e.g. 33.8
mL (28% NH3) in 597 mL milliQ H2 0, total volume including trapped/bound H2 0
is 1OOOmL for target molarity of 0.5M NH3).
[00146]       Weigh lignin (290 g) and add ammonia solution (597 mL of 0.5 M
NH3 as described above) into a formulation vessel at least twice the final
expected volume (to allow for initial foaming). Mix by overhead stirring using
blade attachment at high speed (ca. 500 rpm) until formulation is homogenous.
Reduce stirring speed (ca. 100-200 rpm). Circulate lignin ammonia solution
through the AC percolation column and return outflow to formulation vessel.
Continue circulation and overhead stirring using paddle attachment with the
vessel exposed to atmospheric pressure and heated at 80 0C (by heating plate)
for ca. 3 hrs. The AC may be added into the alkaline ammonia solution itself but
it is preferred that the column approach described be employed.
[00147]       Remove subsample and allow to cool to ambient temperature. Spot
check for odour removal by nose and comparison to typical formulation. If not
deemed satisfactory continue AC column treatment and repeat spot check in 30
min intervals. Once satisfactory, remove from heat and stop treatment.
[00148]       Blend formulation (either by magnetic or overhead stirring) within a
vessel exposed to ambient conditions and heated at 80 0 C (by heating plate) for
ca. 20hrs. Post 24hrs measure the pH of the formulation. If pH is greater than

                                         28
7.2 continue stirring and recheck every 1-2 hours. Once pH approaches neutral
(ca. 7.2), formulation will begin to thicken and appear 'toffee like'. This may be
quite rapid.
[00149]      Measure the Brookfields Viscosity (BrViS) of a subsample and
confirm greater than 2000 mPa.s. If BrVis is too low continue stirring and
subsample every hour until BrVis within range (>2000 mPa.s). Once formulation
is within range cool to ambient, adjust the pH to ca. 8.4-5 with neat NH3 (28%).
Check the BrVis which should be in the range of 1000-1200 mPa.s (60rpm,
spindle 3). This is the final formulation (LBCv1 .1+AC) which should be sealed
and preferably refrigerated until usage. Prior to usage ensure pH is within range
(pH 8.4-5) and adjust if required (28% NH3). Finally, check final BrVis is within
range (1000-1200 mPa.s).
[00150]     As discussed for the LBCv1.0 formulation, foaming may be managed
with addition of aerosolised ethanol or defoamer and the reaction may
optionally take place in a sealed vessel capable of drawing a partial vacuum
(ca. 12-16mm Hg) to remove volatile gases produced during stirring. Once
formulation is blended vacuum is switched off and formulation passed through a
GAC column for ca. 2-6 bed volumes with GAC treated formulation subsampled
and tested by noise until odour is suitably reduced. Vacuum is then resumed
until formulation is ready. Once again, experiments have shown a greater range
of pH's (i.e. less than 8.4-8.5) and lower viscosities (i.e. lower than 1000-1200
cps) also form an effective coating which provides good water barriers if
appropriately annealed.
Thermal Annealinq Experiments
[00151]     A temperature annealing series using the above standard (LBCv1.0)
and deodorised (LBCv1.1 +AC) formulations (both pH 8.4-5 BrVis 1000-1200
Brookfield viscometer 1000 to 1200 cp) coated onto Kraft 205 paper on the
shiny side by drawdown coater was performed.

                                                29
[00152]     For the LBCv1.0 the coating application was Rod 0 + Rod 9 on a
drawdown coater for annealing temperatures 390C (preconditioning oven and
max thermal treatment for room temp samples) and then 100*C to 2200C (in
10 C intervals). All paper used in the experiments was preconditioned by
heating at 390C prior to coating. The duration of the coated samples within the
oven was 90 s after the rod 0 application and 5 min after the second coating
application (Rod 9). Therefore, the total annealing duration was 6 min 30 s.
[00153]     For LBCv1.1+AC the coating application was Rod 0 + Rod 9 and
Rod 0 + Rod 6 for annealing temperatures 1600C to 2200C (in 10*C intervals).
As above, the duration within oven was 90 s for Rod 0, 5 min for second
application (Rod 9 and Rod 6). Total annealing duration 6 min 30 s.
[00154]     The results of these experiments are presented in table 1, below,
and are shown graphically in FIGs 1 (LBCv1.0) and 2 (LBCv1.1 +AC). Control
measurements in the results are from paper that has been through the heat
treatment without being coated with any formulation.

Coating Weiqht Experiments
[00155]      A complete coating weight series was performed using the standard
formulation (LBCv1.0, pH8.4-5, BrVis1 000-1200) applied onto K205 shiny side
by a drawdown coater. Application was Rod 0 which was flashed for 90 s at
220 0 C followed by Rod 0 to Rod 9 thermally annealed for 5 min at 220 0 C. The
total annealing duration was therefore 6 min 30 s. A rod 0 coating was also
made by itself (i.e. no subsequent coating) and annealed for 5 min at 220 0 C.
The results of these experiments are presented in table 2, below, and are
shown graphically in FIG 3.

Acid Treatment Experiments
[00157]      An acid treatment using a deodorised (LBCv1.1 +AC) formulation with
2% natural latex (w/w), coated onto Kraft 205 paper on the shiny side with a
single Rod 6 application by drawdown coater was performed.
[00158]       Glacial acetic acid was applied evenly to the lignin coated substrates
using an atomized spray to obtain even contact across the surface with no
pooling or run off. It has been found that acetic acid which is diluted in a variety
of miscible volatile solvents such as ethanol or ethyl acetate may also be
successfully used. Water and glycerol is also suitable.
[00159]       Post acid application the treated substrate was oven dried at 110*C
for five minutes to speed up residual moisture removal. It has been observed
that leaving treated samples in a well vented area such as a fume hood has a
comparable effect but takes longer.
[00160]      A comparison between coated substrates with surfaces treated with
acid (5 min, 100    OC),  without acid and coating dried (5 min, 100 OC), and without
acid and coating annealed (5 min, 220          OC) are presented in Table 4, below.
Control measurements in the results are from paper that has not been through
any heat or acid treatment and without being coated with any formulation.

[00161]      Samples treated by acid produced a surface that did not easily
transfer post prolonged water contact (30 min) and a Cobb value comparable to
industry standards such as SuperVisy, whose performance is ca. 87 g/m2 by
Cobb (30 min) analysis. It is believed that further optimisation of this acid
treatment process can produce further improved Cobb values.
Annealinq Usinq Liqnin Formulation with Activated Carbon (AC) and Latex
[00162]      Using a deodorised formulation of lignin with granular activated
carbon (GAC) treated with a natural latex plasticizer (+ 2% LaN) at appropriate
viscosity (BrVis 620 - 820 (mPa.s)) a full annealing duration investigation was
conducted.
[00163]      Samples were coated by drawdown coating onto K205 Shiny liner
board by application of Rod 6 for 5, 4 and 2 min followed by Rod c for 90 s at
220, 200 and 180 0 C thermal annealing conditions (for a total of 6.5, 5.5 and 3.5
minutes treatment respectively). A single Rod 6 + Rod C (5 min, 90 s - 160
deg) and Rod 1 + Rod 1 (2 min, 90 s - 160 deg) were created as examples of
'worst case' temperature profiles. A summary of the results is included in table 5
and represented graphically by the surface plot in FIG 4.

[00164]      A good outcome from such a trial is a surface that achieves a barrier
coating of less than or equivalent to industry representatives, such as

                                        33
SuperVisy, whose performance is ca. 87 g/m2 by Cobb (30 min) analysis. It can
be seen that the present coatings perform better than comparative standards
and values within the green range of FIG 4 (Cobb (30 min) of 40 - 65 (g/m2))
are obtained which is considered representative of an excellent waterproof
coating. It is only when annealing temperatures drop below 1600C that values
reach what is shown in FIG 4 to be the red zone representing a coating which
would not be commercially desirable.
Experiments with Liqnin Solution at Non-alkaline PH
[00165]      Mix 10.00 g of NH3 (30 %) with 413 g DI H2 0 creating a 0.4 M NH3
solution into an ambient reactor. Blend with 135.1 g lignin for total formulation of
558.9 g and a final target dry solids of (%DS) of 22.66. The target dry solids
(%DS) quoted compensates for the moisture content of the starting lignin. In
this case the lignin moisture content used was 6.3 %.
[00166]      The sample displayed a pH of 7.1 and had a viscosity of BrVis 80
100 mPa.s. The sample was stored for 2 days and it was found that the pH had
dropped further to 6.9 (ambient) and small lignin aggregates had formed. Itwas
obvious that some lignin had dropped out of solution, likely due o the now mildly
acidic pH, and was in a suspension state.
[00167]      In terms of performance the pH 6.9 formulation was coated onto
Kraft linerboard (K205) along with two similar formulation samples but where
the pH had been adjusted back 'up' to 7.7 and 8.8. All samples were annealed
at 2200C after coating. The results are shown in table 6.
[00168]      All coatings created a substrate that looked good, but had a higher
friction surface instead of a standard smooth gloss. This would likely be due to
the use of a formulation in which the lignin was only partially solubilised. Cobb
values improved as the pH increased, and useful water barrier properties were
achieved. This indicates that although an alkaline lignin solution is preferably
employed as the coating composition, a useful waterproof coating can be
obtained even when a mildly acidic lignin solution is the starting point so long as

                                          34
the subsequent treatment, in this case a heat treatment, achieves the required
transition of the physical form of the lignin.

Preparation of Deodorised formulation at Scale
[00169]       Activated carbon column is firstly prepared as follows:
1.      Fill with 375 kg of granular activated carbon and seal flange lid.
2.      Charge with hot water (water & steam) with top vent open, until full.
3.     Close top vent and purge with hot water until no more air bubbles are in
the discharge.
4.     Remove flange lid, drain to surface of carbon (ensuring carbon is covered
with water at all times), and leave overnight. Column will have to be pre-heated
prior to use.
[00170]        The alkaline lignin coating solution is then prepared as follows:
 1. Add 2.5 tonnes of water (deionized (DI) or reverse osmosis (RO) treated if
possible - should be ca. pH 5.5) to the reactor at ambient temperature.
 2. Add 100 kg of aqueous ammonia (if it is 30 % ammonia) while stirring at
ambient temperature. The vacuum will be on and the condenser recirculating
(reflux) into the reactor.
 3.   Begin heating reactor and blending 1 tonne of lignin. Approximately 10 L of
ethanol may be required to reduce foaming.
 4. Close reactor and heat to 85 - 95 *C until lignin is dissolved (continue ref lux
conditions).
 5. Circulate lignin solution through activated carbon column. Column can be
topped up with formulation with top valve open to fill headspace with minimal

                                         35
disturbance of carbon bed. Then close top valve and begin flow through
operation while taking initial water discharge (the column void) to waste. As the
lignin formulation breaks through (not initial color change, but when output from
column is comparable in viscosity to inlet - this can be tested by touching
formulation with gloves and comparing resistance to pulling thumb and
forefinger apart - we can assist with this stage) divert the discharge from waste
to the reactor. Re-circulate 4 to 5 reaction volumes (12000 L to 15000 L) of
formulation through the column. Then open top valve and drain remaining liquid
in the column into reactor.
 6.   Reduce the formulation volume under partial vacuum until it reaches a
desired room temperature viscosity.
[00171]      The above experimental         approach will provide deodorised
formulations without plasticiser which are appropriate as inputs to the next
stage of coating followed by heat treatment or acid treatment to obtain a
waterproof coating. Alternatively a plasticiser may be added after step 6 upon
transferring the composition into an appropriate storage container. This
methodology will be a practical approach for producing formulation at the scale
required for industrial application.

90 0 C Temperature Treatment and Extended Annealinq

coated shiny side by drawdown coater (Rod 7) in a single coat application and
annealed within an oven preheated to 90 0C for 3 hours. The annealed coated
substrate displayed no transfer of the coating post heavy rubbing and achieved
a Cobb (30 min) of 72.7 (g/m2) compared to a Cobb (30 min) of 90.9 for the

by drawdown coater (Rod 6) in a single coat application and annealed within an

are indicated in table 9 and FIG 7.
[00176]       In the laboratory scale ovens used, the substrate required ca. 3 min
for the coated surface to reach the target annealing conditions (1800C). This is
also the apparent point of optimal performance in terms of annealing duration
with limited performance increase for extended durations tested. It is
appreciated that in commercial scale heating equipment, the time required for a
substrates surface to reach the target annealing conditions will be far quicker
and typically in the order of seconds.

[00179]     Into a reactor add 900 kg of water (deionized) and 54 kg of aqueous
ammonia (25 % NH3) while stirring at ambient temperature. Add 60 kg of

continue stirring. Begin heating reactor to 500C and begin adding lignin 460 kg
of raw lignin PB1 k (13) (2.8%MSTR).Wash the inside of reactor walls with a
further 127 kg of water (deionized). Close reactor and heat to greater than 80 0 C
and then continue to stir for at least 1 hour under reflux. The final formulation
should be ca. 36 - 40% DS, pH ca. 8.1 to 8.9 and Brookfield's viscosity of 600
900 cP at ambient (ca. 23 deg).
[00180]     The results shown for the experiments using 20% and 10% of
glycerol, respectively, indicate the success of the approach whereby glycerol is
used to achieve similar Cobb values with a reduction in the required annealing
temperatures. Thus, while the use of glycerol is not essential to the present
invention it is preferred in terms of the reduced temperature requirement and
the quality of the waterproof film that is formed.
[00181]     The present invention thus provides for excellent quality waterproof
and/or strengthening coatings based on compositions which contain only lignin
as the sole active waterproofing and/or strengthening agent. The transformation
of the lignin into a preferred state which provides surprisingly effective

                                         40
waterproofing and/or strengthening properties on the substrate is achieved by
either a thermal annealing at temperatures above about 1600C or by an acid
treatment step. Such a simple formulation is easily handled, requires minimal
manipulation in terms of optimising pH, viscosity and the like and is extremely
cost effective due to the simplicity of the active ingredients and the wide
availability of lignin.
