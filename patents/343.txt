Background of the Invention
In recent years the production of immunoglobulins has steadily increased and it is likely that
immunoglobulins will become the biggest group of therapeutics available for the treatment of
various diseases in the near future. The impact of immunoglobulins emerges from their
specificity, which comprises their specific target recognition and binding function as well as
the activation of specific effects concurrently with or after antigen/Fc-receptor binding.
The specific target recognition and binding is mediated by the variable region of the
immunoglobulin. Other parts of the immunoglobulin molecule, from which effects originate,
are posttranslational modifications, such as the glycosylation pattern. The posttranslational
modifications do have an influence on the efficacy, stability, immunogenic potential, binding
etc. of an immunoglobulin. In connection therewith complement-dependent cytotoxicity
(CDC), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and induction of apoptosis have to
be addressed.

It has been reported that the glycosylation pattern of immunoglobulins, i.e. the
saccharide composition and number of attached glycostructures, has a strong
influence on the biological properties (see e.g. Jefferis, R., Biotechnol. Prog. 21
(2005) 11-16). Immunoglobulins produced by mammalian cells contain 2-3 % by
mass carbohydrates (Taniguchi, T., et al., Biochem. 24 (1985) 5551-5557). This is
equivalent e.g. in an immunoglobulin of class G (IgG) to 2.3 oligosaccharide
residues in an IgG of mouse origin (Mizuochi, T., et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys.
257 (1987) 387-394) and to 2.8 oligosaccharide residues in an IgG of human origin
(Parekh, R.B., et al., Nature 316 (1985) 452-457), whereof generally two are
located in the Fc-region and the remaining in the variable region (Saba, J.A., et al.,
Anal. Biochem. 305 (2002) 16-31).
In the Fc-region of an immunoglobulin of class G oligosaccharide residues can be
introduced via N-glycosylation at amino acid residue 297, which is an asparagine
residue (denoted as Asn297). Youings et al. have shown that a further
                                         la

                                            -2
   N-glycosylation site exists in 15 % to 20 % of polyclonal IgG molecules in the
   Fab-region (Youings, A., et al., Biochem. J., 314 (1996) 621-630; see e.g. also
   Endo, T., et al., Mol. Immunol. 32 (1995) 931-940). Due to inhomogeneous, i.e.
   asymmetric, oligosaccharide processing, multiple isoforms of an immunoglobulin
 5 with different glycosylation pattern exist (Patel, T.P., et al., Biochem. J. 285 (1992)
   839-845; Ip, C.C., et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 308 (1994) 387-399; Lund, J., et
   al., Mol. Immunol. 30 (1993) 741-748). Concurrently the structure and distribution
   of the oligosaccharides is both highly reproducible (i.e. non-random) and site
   specific (Dwek, R.A., et al., J. Anat. 187 (1995) 279-292).
10 Some characteristics of an immunoglobulin are directly linked to the glycosylation
   of the Fc-region (see e.g. Dwek, R.A., et al., J. Anat. 187 (1995) 279-292; Lund, J.,
   et al., J. Immunol. 157 (1996) 4963-4969; Lund, J., FASEB J. 9 (1995) 115-119;

   example thermal stability and solubility (West, C.M., Mol. Cell. Biochem. 72
15 (1986) 3-20), antigenicity (Turco, S.J., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 205 (1980) 330
   339), immunogenicity (Bradshaw, J.P., et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 847 (1985)

   (Ashwell, G. and Harford, J., Ann. Rev. Biochem. 51 (1982) 531-554; McFarlane,

   specific activity (Jefferis, R. and Lund, J., in Antibody Engineering, ed. by Capra,
25 J.D., Chem. Immunol. Basel, Karger, 65 (1997) 111-128).
   Factors influencing the glycosylation pattern have been investigated, such as for
   example presence of fetal calf serum in the fermentation medium (Gawlitzek, M.,
   et al., J. Biotechnol. 42(2) (1995) 117-13 1), buffering conditions (Miithing, J., et al.,
   Biotechnol. Bioeng. 83 (2003) 321-334), dissolved oxygen concentration (Saba,

   (1998) 55-71; Lin, A.A., et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 42 (1993) 339-350), position
   and conformation of the oligosaccharide as well as host cell type and cellular
   growth state (Hahn, T.J. and Goochee, C.F., J. Biol. Chem. 267 (1992) 23982
   23987; Jenkins, N., et al., Nat. Biotechnol.           14 (1996)     975-981),  cellular
35 nucleotide-sugar metabolism (Hills, A.E., et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 75 (2001)
   239-251), nutrient limitations (Gawlitzek, M., et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 46 (1995)

   glucose restriction (Tachibana, H., et al., Cytotechnology 16 (1994) 151-157), and
   extracellular pH (Borys, M.C., et al., Bio/Technology 11 (1993) 720-724).
   Increased oligomannose structures as well as truncated oligosaccharide structures
 5 have been observed by the recombinant expression of immunoglobulins e.g. in NSO
   myeloma cells (Ip, C.C., et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 308 (1994) 387-399;
   Robinson, D.K., et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 44 (1994) 727-735). Under glucose
   starvation conditions variations in glycosylation, such as attachment of smaller
   precursor oligosaccharides or complete absence of oligosaccharide moieties, have
10 been observed in CHO cells, Murine 3T3 cells, rat hepatoma cells, rat kidney cells
   and Murine myeloma cells (Rearick, J.I., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 256 (1981) 6255

   The Japanese Patent Application JP 62-258252 reports a perfusion culture of
20 mammalian cells, whereas US 5,443,968 reports a fed-batch culture method for
   protein secreting cells. In WO 98/41611 a method for cultivating cells is reported
   effective to adapt the cells to a metabolic state characterized by low lactate
   production. A method for culturing cells in order to produce substances is reported
   in WO 2004/048556. Elbein, A.D., Ann. Rev. Biochem. 56 (1987) 497-534, reports
25 that mammalian cells when incubated in the absence of glucose transfer mannose-5
   containing structures instead of mannose-9 containing structures to proteins. The
   dependence of pCO2 influences during glucose limitation on CHO cell growth,
   metabolism and IgG production is reported by Takuma, S., et al. in Biotechnol.

30 Summary
   It has been found that the amount of the mannose-5 glycostructure in the
   glycosylation pattern of a polypeptide produced by a eukaryotic cell can be
   modified based on the amount of glucose provided to the cell in the cultivation
   process. By reducing the amount of glucose available, e.g. by changing the DGL

   Detailed Description
   Herein is reported a method for the production of an immunoglobulin comprising
   the following steps:
          a)   cultivating a mammalian cell comprising a nucleic acid encoding the
 5             immunoglobulin in a cultivation medium at a constant DGL of less than
               0.8 (i.e. the amount of glucose available per time unit is constant and
               80 % or less of the amount of glucose that can maximally be utilized by
               the cell per time unit), and
          b)   recovering the immunoglobulin from the cells or the culture medium.
10 With the method as reported herein an immunoglobulin can be obtained wherein
   the amount of the immunoglobulin with a mannose-5 glycostructure depends on the
   adjusted DGL value, and wherein the amount is the fraction of the sum of the
   amount of the immunoglobulin with a mannose-5 glycostructure, and of the
   immunoglobulin G(O) isoform, and of the immunoglobulin G(1) isoform, and of
15 the immunoglobulin G(2) isoform. In one embodiment the DGL is of from 0.8 to
   0.2. In this embodiment the fraction is 10 % or less. In another embodiment the
   DGL is of from 0.6 to 0.4. In this embodiment the fraction is 6 % or less. With the
   method as reported herein an immunoglobulin can be obtained wherein the fraction
   of the immunoglobulin having a mannose-5 glycostructure is 10 % or less of the
20 sum comprising the amount of the immunoglobulin with a mannose-5
   glycostructure, the amount of the immunoglobulin G(0) isoform, the amount of the
   immunoglobulin G(1) isoform, and the amount of the immunoglobulin G(2)
   isoform. In another embodiment the fraction is the area-% fraction determined in a
   liquid chromatography method. In one embodiment the DGL is maintained in the
25 range of from 0.8 to 0.2. In another embodiment the DGL is maintained in the
   range of from 0.6 to 0.2. In still another embodiment the DGL is maintained in the
   range of from 0.6 to 0.4. In one embodiment the amount of glucose that can
   maximally be utilized by the cell per time unit is the average amount of glucose
   that is utilized in a cultivation in which all compounds are available in excess, i.e.
30 no compound is limiting the growth of the cell, determined based on at least five
   cultivations. In one embodiment the fraction is determined on day seven of the
   cultivation.

   The use of recombinant DNA technology enables the production of numerous
   derivatives of a polypeptide. Such derivatives can, for example, be modified in
   individual or several amino acid positions by substitution, alteration or exchange.
   The derivatization can, for example, be carried out by means of site directed
15 mutagenesis. Such variations can easily be carried out by a person skilled in the art
   (Sambrook, J., et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Third Edition,
   Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, USA (2001); Hames, B.D. and
   Higgins, S.G., Nucleic acid hybridization - a practical approach (1985) IRL Press,
   Oxford, England).
20 The term "nucleic acid" denotes a naturally occurring or partially or fully
   non-naturally occurring nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide. The nucleic
   acid can be build up of DNA-fragments which are either isolated or synthesized by
   chemical means. The nucleic acid can be integrated into another nucleic acid, e.g.
   in an expression plasmid or the genome/chromosome of a eukaryotic cell. The term
25 "plasmid" includes shuttle and expression plasmids. Typically, the plasmid will
   also comprise a prokaryotic propagation unit comprising an origin of replication
   (e.g. the ColEl origin of replication) and a selectable marker (e.g. ampicillin or
   tetracycline resistance gene), for replication and selection, respectively, of the
   plasmid in prokaryotic cells. To a person skilled in the art procedures and methods
30 are well known to convert an amino acid sequence, e.g. of a polypeptide, into a
   corresponding nucleic acid encoding the respective amino acid sequence. Therefore,
   a nucleic acid is characterized by its nucleic acid sequence consisting of individual
   nucleotides and likewise by the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide encoded
   thereby.

                                             -8
   The term "expression cassette" denotes a nucleic acid that contains the elements
   necessary for expression and optionally for secretion of at least the contained
   structural gene in/from a cell, such as a promoter, polyadenylation site, and 3'- and
   5'-untranslated regions.
 5 The term "gene" denotes e.g. a segment on a chromosome or on a plasmid, which
   is necessary for the expression of a polypeptide. Beside the coding region a gene
   comprises other functional elements including a promoter, introns, and one or more
   transcription terminators. A "structural gene" denotes the coding region of a gene
   without a signal sequence.
10 The term "expression" denotes the transcription and translation of a structural gene
   within a cell. The level of transcription of a structural gene in a cell can be
   determined on the basis of the amount of corresponding mRNA that is present in
   the cell. For example, mRNA transcribed from a selected nucleic acid can be
   quantitated by PCR or by Northern hybridization (see e.g. Sambrook et al. (supra)).
15 A polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid can be quantitated by various methods,
   e.g. by ELISA, by determining the biological activity of the polypeptide, or by
   employing methods that are independent of such activity, such as Western blotting
   or radioimmunoassay, using antibodies that recognize and bind to the polypeptide
   (see e.g. Sambrook et al. (supra)).
20 The term "cell" denotes a cell into which a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide, in
   one embodiment a heterologous polypeptide, has been introduced. The term "cell"
   includes both prokaryotic cells used for propagation of plasmids/vectors as well as
   eukaryotic cells used for expression of the structural gene. In one embodiment a
   eukaryotic cell for the expression of an immunoglobulin is a mammalian cell. In
25 another embodiment the mammalian cell is selected from CHO cells, NSO cells,
   Sp2/0 cells, COS cells, HEK cells, BHK cells, PER.C6* cells, and hybridoma cells.
   A eukaryotic cell can be selected in addition from insect cells, such as caterpillar
   cells (Spodoptera frugiperda, sf cells), fruit fly cells (Drosophila melanogaster),
   mosquito cells (Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus), and silkworm cells (Bombyx
30 Mori), and the like.
   The term "polypeptide" denotes a polymer of amino acid residues joined by peptide
   bonds, whether produced naturally or synthetically. Polypeptides of less than about
   20 amino acid residues may be referred to as "peptides". Polypeptides of more than
   100 amino acid residues or covalent and non-covalent aggregates comprising more
35 than one polypeptide may be referred to as "proteins". Polypeptides may comprise

                                            -9
   non-amino acid components, such as carbohydrate groups. The non-amino acid
   components may be added to the polypeptide by the cell in which the polypeptide
   is produced, and may vary with the type of cell. Polypeptides are defined herein in
   terms of their amino acid sequence in N- to C-terminal direction. Additions thereto,
 5 such as carbohydrate groups, are generally not specified, but may be present
   nonetheless.
   The term "heterologous DNA" or "heterologous polypeptide" denotes a DNA
   molecule or a polypeptide, or a population of DNA molecules or a population of
   polypeptides, which do not exist naturally within a given cell. DNA molecules
10 heterologous to a particular cell may contain DNA derived from the cell's species
   (i.e. endogenous DNA) so long as that DNA is combined with non-host DNA (i.e.
   exogenous DNA). For example, a DNA molecule containing a non-cell's DNA
   segment, e.g. encoding a polypeptide, operably linked to a cell's DNA segment, e.g.
   comprising a promoter, is considered to be a heterologous DNA molecule.
15 Likewise, a heterologous DNA molecule can comprise an endogenous structural
   gene operably linked to an exogenous promoter. A polypeptide encoded by a
   heterologous DNA molecule is a "heterologous" polypeptide.
   The term "expression plasmid" denotes a nucleic acid comprising at least one
   structural gene encoding a polypeptide to be expressed. Typically, an expression
20 plasmid comprises a prokaryotic plasmid propagation unit, including an origin of
   replication and a selection marker, e.g. for E.coli, an eukaryotic selection marker,
   and one or more expression cassettes for the expression of the structural gene(s) of
   interest each in turn comprising a promoter, at least one structural gene, and a
   transcription terminator including a polyadenylation signal. Gene expression is
25 usually placed under the control of a promoter, and such a structural gene is to be
   "operably linked to" the promoter. Similarly, a regulatory element and a core
   promoter are operably linked if the regulatory element modulates the activity of the
   core promoter.
   The term "isolated polypeptide" denotes a polypeptide that is essentially free from
30 associated cellular components, such as carbohydrate, lipid, or other proteinaceous
   or non-proteinaceous impurities, which are not covalently associated with the
   polypeptide. Typically, a preparation of an isolated polypeptide contains in certain
   embodiments the polypeptide in a highly purified form, i.e. at least about 80 %
   pure, at least about 90 % pure, at least about 95 % pure, greater than 95 % pure, or
35 greater than 99 % pure. One way to show that a particular protein preparation

                                           - 10
   contains an isolated polypeptide is by the appearance of a single band following
   sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-page) of the
   preparation and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the gel. However, the term
   "isolated" does not exclude the presence of the same polypeptide in alternative
 5 physical forms, such as dimers, or alternatively glycosylated or derivatized forms.
   Immunoglobulins      in general are assigned into five different classes: IgA
   (immunoglobulin of class A), IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM. Between these classes the
   immunoglobulins differ in their overall structure and/or amino acid sequence but
   have the same building blocks. Complete immunoglobulins are built up of two
10 pairs of polypeptide chains, each comprising an immunoglobulin light polypeptide
   chain (short: light chain) and an immunoglobulin heavy polypeptide chain (short:
   heavy chain). In turn the chains comprise a variable region and a constant region.
   In a light chain both regions consist of one domain, whereas in a heavy chain the
   variable region consists of one domain and the constant region comprises up to five
15 domains (in N- to C-terminal direction): the CHi-domain, optionally the hinge
   region domain, the CH2-domain, the CH3-domain, and optionally the CH4-domain.
   An immunoglobulin can be dissected in a Fab- and an Fc-region. The entire light
   chain, the heavy chain variable domain and the CHI domain are referred to as Fab
   region (fragment antigen binding-region). The Fc-region comprises the CH2-, CH3-,
20 and optionally the CH4-domain.
   As used herein, the term "immunoglobulin" denotes a protein consisting of one or
   more polypeptides. The encoding immunoglobulin genes include the different
   constant region genes as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes.
   The term "immunoglobulin" comprise in one embodiment monoclonal antibodies
25 and fragments thereof, such as an isolated heavy chain, or a heavy chain constant
   region, as well as fusion polypeptides comprising at least an immunoglobulin
   heavy chain CH2-domain. In one embodiment of the method as reported herein the
   immunoglobulin is a complete immunoglobulin, in another embodiment the
   immunoglobulin is an Fc-region of a complete immunoglobulin. In another
30 embodiment the immunoglobulin is an immunoglobulin, or an immunoglobulin
   fragment, or an immunoglobulin conjugate.
   The term "immunoglobulin fragment" denotes a polypeptide comprising at least
   the CH2-domain of an immunoglobulin delta, epsilon, or alpha heavy chain, and/or
   the CH3-domain of an immunoglobulin epsilon or delta heavy chain. Encompassed

                                            - 11
   are also derivatives and variants thereof wherein the N-glycosylation motif Asn
   Xaa-Ser/Thr in the CH2- or CH3-domain is not changed.
   The term "immunoglobulin conjugate" denotes a polypeptide comprising at least
   the CH2-domain of an immunoglobulin delta, epsilon, or alpha heavy chain, and/or
 5 the CH3-domain of an immunoglobulin epsilon or delta heavy chain fused to a non
   immunoglobulin polypeptide. Therein the N-glycosylation motif Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr
   in the CH2- or CH3-domain is not changed.

   domain and/or to Asn3 , Asn         , or Asn      (IgE, IgD) of a CH3-domain of an
10 immunoglobulin heavy chain have a biantennary structure (Mizuochi, T., et al.,
   Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 257 (1987) 387-394), i.e. they consist of a core structure
   of
           Man(a 1-4)GlcNAc(j 1-4)GlcNAc->Asn
   with an optional Fuc(al-6) linkage at the terminal GlcNAc residue. Two outer
15 arms are connected to the terminal mannose of the core structure having the
   formula
           Gal(p l-4)GlcNAc( 1-2)Man(al-6)->Man, and
           Gal(p 1-4)GlcNAc(3 1-2)Man(a 1-3)->Man,
   wherein the terminal        galactose    residues    are   optional (Man= mannose,

   The term "the amount of the immunoglobulin G(O) isoform, the amount of the
   immunoglobulin G(1) isoform, and the amount of the immunoglobulin G(2)
   isoform" denotes the sum of the amounts of the different, heterogeneous,
25 biantennary oligosaccharides N-linked to an asparagine (Asn) of an
   immunoglobulin. The G(2) isoform has a terminal galactose residue on each of the
   outer-arms of the oligosaccharide structure, the G(1) isoform bears only a galactose

                                             -  12
   residue on either the (al-6) or (al-3) linked outer-arm, and the G(0) isoform bears
   no galactose residue on both outer-arms.
   The term "mannose-5 glycostructure" denotes an oligomannose-structure linked to
   an Asn residue of a polypeptide comprising or consisting of five mannose residues
 5 and two N-acetyl glucose core residues, forming a triantennary structure.
   One aspect as reported herein is a method for the production of an immunoglobulin
   comprising the following steps:
         a)    cultivating a eukaryotic cell, preferably a mammalian cell, comprising
               one or more nucleic acid(s) encoding the immunoglobulin in a
10             cultivation medium wherein the amount of glucose available in the
               cultivation medium per time unit is kept constant and limited to a value
               of less than 80 % of the amount that could maximally be utilized by the
               eukaryotic cells in the cultivating per time unit, and
         b)    recovering the immunoglobulin from the cell or the culture medium
15             and thereby producing an immunoglobulin.
   With this method an immunoglobulin is obtained comprising at most 10 % of an
   immunoglobulin with a mannose-5 glycostructure. The 10 % are calculated based
   on the sum of the amount of the immunoglobulin with a mannose-5 glycostructure,
   the amount of the immunoglobulin G(0) isoform, the amount of the
20 immunoglobulin G(1) isoform, and the amount of the immunoglobulin G(2)
   isoform.
   The terms "degree of glucose limitation" and its abbreviation "DGL", which can be
   used interchangeably herein, denote the ratio of the current specific glucose
   consumption rate of a single cell in a cultivation to the maximum known specific
25 glucose consumption rate of the single cell or a single cell of the same kind. The
   degree of glucose limitation is defined as
                                               qGlc
                                  DGL    = ------------
                                            qGlcmax
30 with        qGlc = current specific glucose consumption rate of a single cell;
               qGlcmax = maximum known specific glucose consumption rate for this
                  single cell or a single cell of the same kind.

                                            - 13
   The DGL can vary between       DGLmaintenance and 1 whereby  DGLmaintenance (< 1 and
   > 0) denotes complete growth limitation and 1 denotes no limitation or complete
   glucose excess.
   The introduction of glycostructures to polypeptides, e.g. immunoglobulins, is a
 5 post-translational modification. Due to incompleteness of the glycosylation
   procedure of the respective cell every expressed polypeptide is obtained with a
   glycosylation pattern comprising different glycostructures. Thus, a polypeptide is
   obtained from a cell expressing it in form of a composition comprising differently
   glycosylated forms of the same polypeptide, i.e. with the same amino acid
10 sequence. The sum of the individual glycostructures is denoted as glycosylation
   pattern, comprising e.g. polypeptides with completely missing glycostructures,
   differently processed glycostructures, and/or differently composed glycostructures.
   One glycostructure is the mannose-5 glycostructure (also denoted as high-mannose,
   Man5, M5, or oligo-mannose). It has been reported, that the fraction of
15 recombinantly produced polypeptides with the mannose-5 glycostructure is
   increased with prolonged cultivation time or under glucose starvation conditions
   (Robinson, D.K., et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 44 (1994) 727-735; Elbein, A.D., Ann.
   Rev. Biochem. 56 (1987) 497-534).
   It has been found that the amount of the mannose-5 glycostructure in the
20 glycosylation pattern of a polypeptide produced by a eukaryotic cell can be
   modified based on the amount of glucose provided to the cell in the cultivation
   process. It has been found that by reducing the amount of glucose, i.e. by changing
   the DGL value from 1.0 to smaller values of e.g. 0.8, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, or 0.2, a
   modification in the mannose-5 glycostructure amount in the glycosylation pattern
25 can be achieved. In one embodiment the DGL value is kept constant at a value
   within a range, such as from 0.8 to 0.2, or from 0.6 to 0.4. That is, the production
   of a polypeptide, in one embodiment of an immunoglobulin, can be performed
   under conditions wherein a restricted amount of glucose is available to the
   cultivated cell in order to obtain the polypeptide with a defined amount of the
30 mannose-5 glycostructure in the glycosylation pattern. It has been found that a
   cultivation with an amount of glucose available per time unit of 80 % or less of the
   amount of glucose that can maximally be utilized by the cells per time unit, in one
   embodiment by exponentially growing cells, i.e with a DGL of 0.8 or less, yields a
   polypeptide with a glycosylation pattern in which the amount of the mannose-5
35 glycostructure is changed compared to a cultivation with a DGL of 1.0. In one

                                           - 14
   embodiment the cell density is the viable cell density. Additionally the obtained
   polypeptide yield is increased.
   The term "the amount of glucose that can maximally be utilized by the cell per time
   unit" denotes the amount of glucose that is maximally consumed or utilized or
 5 metabolized per time unit by a single cell under optimum growth conditions in the
   exponential growth phase in a cultivation without any nutrient limitation. Thus, the
   amount of glucose that can maximally be utilized by the cell per time unit can be
   determined by determining the amount of glucose that is metabolized per time unit
   by a cell under optimum growth conditions in the exponential growth phase in a
10 cultivation without any nutrient limitation. A further increase of the available
   amount of glucose will not further increase, i.e. change, the amount of glucose that
   can maximally be utilized by the cell per time unit. This amount defines the
   maximum level of glucose consumption of a single cell. This does not denote that a
   genetically modified version of the cell might not have an even higher maximum
15 level of glucose consumption. Alternatively the amount of glucose that can be
   maximally be utilized by the cell per time unit can be determined based on
   previous cultivations and the monitored data.
   The process as reported herein is particularly simple to carry out, associated with a
   minimum effort for measuring and control, and particularly economic.
20 Without restrictions, e.g. insufficient nutrient supply, cultivated cells grow and
   consume nutrients at maximum rates in an uneconomic manner. One of the
   consumed culture medium nutrients is glucose, which is metabolized by the
   cultivated cells in order to produce energy and building blocks for the cell's
   metabolism. In the presence of excess glucose the cell's metabolism is running at
25 the maximum turnover rate for glucose. The amount of glucose that can maximally
   be utilized by the cell per time unit can for example be determined from the
   glucose consumption of exponentially growing cells in the presence of excess
   glucose cultivated with or under the same cultivation conditions that will also be
   used in the cultivation with restricted glucose, i.e. with an amount of glucose
30 available per time unit that is smaller than that which can be utilized by the cell.
   This maximum amount can be calculated easily by determining the cell density and
   glucose concentration at the beginning and end of a fixed time range. The value is
   normally in a range of from 0.006 to 190 mmol/hour/10 9 cells (Baker, K.N., et al.,
   Biotechnol. Bioeng. 73 (2001) 188-202; WO 98/41611; Miithing, J., et al.,
35 Biotechnol. Bioeng. 83 (2003) 321-334; WO 2004/048556). In one embodiment

                                            - 15
   the qGlcmax is about 0.142 mmol/hour/10 9 cells under standard process conditions
   at pH 7.0.
   The method as reported herein is performed in one embodiment under conditions
   wherein the amount of glucose available per time unit is kept constant and at 80 %
 5 or less of the amount of glucose that can maximally be utilized by the cell per time
   unit (0.8 > DGL > 0), in one embodiment the amount of glucose available is kept
   constant and at 60 % or less (0.6 > DGL > 0), in another embodiment at 50 % or
   less (0.5 > DGL > 0), and in still another embodiment at about 40 %. The term
   "about" as used within this application denotes that the value is no exact value it is
10 merely the central point of a range wherein the value can vary up to 10 %, i.e. the
   term "about 40 %" denotes a range of from 44 % to 36 % (DGL       = 0.44 - 0.36).
   In one embodiment the cultivating is with an amount of glucose available per time
   unit that is kept constant in a range between 80 % and 10 % of the amount of
   glucose that can maximally be utilized by the cell per time unit (0.8 > DGL > 0.1).
15 In another embodiment the amount of glucose available is kept constant in a range
   between 60 % and 10 % (0.6 > DGL > 0.1). In a further embodiment the amount of
   glucose available is kept constant in a range between 50 % and 10 % (0.5 > DGL >
   0.1). In another embodiment the amount of glucose available is kept constant in a
   range between 45 % and 20 % (0.45 > DGL > 0.2). In also an embodiment the
20 amount of glucose available is kept between 80 % and 60 % (0.8 > DGL > 0.6).
   In one embodiment the method comprises the step of cultivating the cell under
   conditions wherein the DGL is kept constant and at a value of about 0.4, whereby
   the cultivating comprises starting with a DGL between 1.0 and 0.5, lowering the
   DGL to a value of about 0.4, and keeping the DGL constant thereafter. In one
25 embodiment the lowering of the DGL is within a time period of 100 hours. The
   term "keeping the DGL constant" and grammatical equivalents thereof denote that
   the DGL value is maintained during a time period, i.e. the variation of the DGL
   value is within 10 % of the value (see e.g. Figure 2).
   The immunoglobulin is recovered after production, either directly or after
30 disintegration of the cell. The recovered immunoglobulin is in one embodiment
   purified with a method known to a person skilled in the art. Different methods are
   well established and widespread used for protein purification, such as affinity
   chromatography with microbial proteins (e.g. protein A or protein G affinity
   chromatography), ion exchange chromatography               (e.g. cation exchange
35 (carboxymethyl resins), anion exchange (amino ethyl resins) and mixed-mode

                                           - 16
   exchange), thiophilic adsorption (e.g. with beta-mercaptoethanol and other SH
   ligands), hydrophobic interaction or aromatic adsorption chromatography (e.g. with
   phenyl-sepharose, aza-arenophilic resins, or m-aminophenylboronic acid), metal
   chelate affinity chromatography (e.g. with Ni(II)- and Cu(II)-affinity material), size
 5 exclusion chromatography, and electrophoretical methods (such as gel
   electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis) (Vijayalakshmi, M.A., Appl. Biochem.
   Biotech. 75 (1998) 93-102).
   For example, a purification process for immunoglobulins in general comprises a
   multistep chromatographic part. In the first step non-immunoglobulin polypeptides
10 are separated from the immunoglobulin fraction by an affinity chromatography, e.g.
   with protein A or G. Afterwards, e.g., ion exchange chromatography can be
   performed to disunite the individual immunoglobulin classes and to remove traces
   of protein A, which has been coeluted from the first column. Finally a
   chromatographic step is employed to separate immunoglobulin monomers from
15 multimers and fragments of the same class.
   General chromatographic methods and their use are known to a person skilled in
   the art. See for example, Heftmann, E. (ed.), Chromatography,     5 th edition, Part A:

   In one embodiment the recovered immunoglobulin is characterized by the amount
   of the immunoglobulin having a mannose-5 glycostructure with respect to the
   amount of a population, which is the sum of the amount of the immunoglobulin
30 with a mannose-5       glycostructure,   the immunoglobulin     G(O)     isoform, the
   immunoglobulin G(1) isoform, and the immunoglobulin G(2) isoform. With the
   method as reported herein the amount of the immunoglobulin with a mannose-5
   glycostructure is in one embodiment 10 % or less of the population, in another
   embodiment 8 % or less of the population, and in a further embodiment 6 % or less
35 of the population.

                                              - 17
   The method as reported herein can be performed in certain embodiments as
   continuous cultivation, as fed-batch cultivation, or as combination thereof, e.g.
   starting as fed-batch cultivation with subsequent crossover to a continuous
   cultivation. Additionally, the method as reported herein can be performed in
 5 different ways. For example, in one embodiment prior to the cultivating under
   conditions with a DGL value below 1.0, i.e. for example under conditions wherein
   the available amount of glucose is 80 % or less of the amount of glucose that can
   maximally be utilized by the cell in the culture per time unit, the cultivating is with
   an excess of glucose, i.e. a DGL value of 1.0. In another embodiment the
10 cultivating is started with an amount of glucose as contained in standard culture
   media, e.g. between 1 and 10 g/l culture medium, e.g. in order to obtain a
   predefined cell density, e.g. in one embodiment of 105 cell/ml. In a further
   embodiment the starting of the cultivating is in the presence of an excess amount of
   glucose, i.e. a DGL of 1.0, and adding an amount of glucose per time unit, which is
15 80 % or less of the amount of glucose that can maximally be utilized per time unit
   by the cells in the cultivation. In another embodiment the feeding is started once
   the amount of glucose present in the culture medium has dropped to or below a
   preset value in the cultivation. In the last two cases the amount of glucose available
   in the culture is reduced by the metabolism of the cells in the cultivation.
20 In one embodiment the amount of glucose, which is available or added per time
   unit and which is less than the amount of glucose that can maximally be utilized, is
   kept at the same value, i.e. constant, in the method as reported herein. For example,
   if an amount of 50 % of the amount of glucose that can maximally be utilized per
   time unit is available, this amount is available in all time units of the method in
25 which a restricted glucose feeding is performed. It has to be pointed out that this
   value is a relative value. Though, as the viable cell density changes during the
   cultivation (i.e. it increases in the beginning, reaches a maximum, and drops
   thereafter again) the absolute amount of available glucose changes accordingly as it
   is a relative value depending on the absolute viable cell density. As the relative
30 value is kept constant (i.e. at e.g. 80 %) but the absolute reference value changes
   (i.e. e.g. increasing viable cell density) also the relative absolute value changes (i.e.
   80 % of an increasing value are also increasing).
   The term "per time unit" denotes a fixed time range, such as 1 minute, 1 hour, 6
   hours, 12 hours, or 24 hours. In one embodiment the time unit is 12 hours or 24
35 hours. The term "amount of glucose available per time unit" as used within this
   application denotes the sum of 1) the amount of glucose contained in the

                                            - 18
   cultivation medium of a cultivation at the beginning of a fixed time range and 2)
   the amount of glucose added, i.e. fed, during the time unit. Thus, an amount of
   glucose is added to the cell cultivation medium, e.g. to the cultivation vessel, which
   increases the amount of glucose in the cultivation medium at the beginning of the
 5 fixed time range to the predetermined amount. This amount of glucose can be
   added, e.g., as solid, dissolved in water, dissolved in a buffer, or dissolved in a
   nutrient medium, whereby water and buffer shall not contain glucose. The amount
   of glucose to be added corresponds to the amount of glucose to be available
   reduced by the amount of glucose present in the medium in the cultivation vessel.
10 The process of adding the amount of glucose can be performed either as single
   addition, as multiple addition of small, equal fractions, or as continuous addition
   during a time unit as described above.
   The method as reported herein is suitable for any kind of cultivation and any
   cultivation scale. For example, in one embodiment the method is used for
15 continuous or fed-batch processes; in another embodiment the cultivation volume
   is of from 100 ml up to 50,000 1,in another embodiment of from 100 1to 10,000 1.
   The method as reported herein is useful for the production of immunoglobulins
   with 10 % or less, or 8 % or less, or 6 % or less of the immunoglobulin having a
   mannose-5 glycostructure. In one embodiment the immunoglobulin is an
20 immunoglobulin G or E. The method as reported herein comprises a eukaryotic cell,
   wherein the cell in turn comprises a nucleic acid encoding the heavy chain of an
   immunoglobulin or a fragment thereof and a nucleic acid encoding the light chain
   of an immunoglobulin or a fragment thereof The eukaryotic cell is in one
   embodiment selected from CHO cells, NSO cells, BHK cells, hybridoma cells,
25 PER.C6* cells, Sp2/0 cells, HEK cells, and insect cells.
   A person skilled in that art is familiar with medium compositions and components
   as well as nutrient concentrations required by different cells for optimal growth in
   addition to the amount of glucose and will choose an appropriate medium for the
   cultivation of the cell (see e.g. Mather, J.P., et al., in Encyclopedia of Bioprocess
30 Technology: Fermentation, Biocatalysis, and Bioseparation, Vol. 2 (1999) 777
   785).
   In one embodiment the amount of glucose that has to be available to the cells in a
   cultivation according to the method as reported herein is calculated by multiplying
   the viable cell density, which can be achieved normally in the culture vessel at a
35 certain point of time of the cultivation, with the volume of the culture vessel and

                                             - 19
   the amount of glucose that can maximally be utilized by the exponentially growing
   cells per time unit and by the intended DGL. In more detail, from the course of the
   glucose concentration in the cultivation and the course of the cell density in the
   cultivation prior to the actual point of time the future course of the glucose
 5 concentration and the cell density are predicted. With this prediction the amount of
   glucose that has to be added to the cultivation to achieve the intended DGL is
   calculated with the following formula:
   (glucose to be added [pg glucose/ml/h])=
                (current cell density [cells/ml]) x
10              (maximum glucose consumption rate of the cell [pg glucose/cell/h]) x
                (DGL value)
                amount of glucose present in the medium in the cultivation vessel.
   In one embodiment the pH value of the cultivation is between pH 6.5 and pH 7.8.
   In another embodiment the pH value is between pH 6.9 and pH 7.3. In a further
15 embodiment the pH value is between pH 7.0 and 7.2. It has been found as outlined
   in Example 1 that in combination with a restricted glucose feeding with a pH value
   of 7.0 in the constant feeding method the M5 content can efficiently be regulated to
   defined values, i.e. below 8 %, compared to a pH value of 7.2. In the cultivations in
   the fed-batch method at pH values of 7.0 or 7.2, respectively, it was found that with
20 the DGL control method the M5 content could be regulated to be less than 5.5 %. It
   has been found that with a reduction of the pH value of the cultivation an increase
   of the M5 amount due to the lowering of the DGL value can be traversed.
   The cultivation is in one embodiment performed at a temperature between 27 0 C
   and 39 0C, in another embodiment between 35 0 C and 37.5 0C.

   hormones, plasminogen activator, erythropoietin and the like.

   Examples
   Materials and Methods
 5 Cell line:
   An exemplary CHO cell line in which the amount of the mannose-5 glycostructure
   of a recombinantly produced immunoglobulin can be modified is a CHO cell line
   comprising a nucleic acid encoding an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody according to
   EP 0 409 607 and US 5,795,965. For the cultivation of the recombinant CHO cell
10 any culture medium can be used as long a glucose supplementation according to
   the method of the invention can be performed. Exemplary culture media are IMDM,
   DMEM or Ham's F12 medium or combinations thereof, which have been adapted
   to the method as reported herein in as much as the mass ratios of the culture
   medium components to glucose are adopted. It is likewise possible to exclude
15 glucose from the cultivation medium and add it to the cultivation separately.
   Cultivation:
   CHO cells expressing an anti-IL-6R antibody were cultivated in a 11 or 2 1
   fermentation vessel. The feeding medium contained 15 to 40 g/l glucose. Glucose
   could be fed with a separate concentrated solution containing of e.g. 400 g/l
20 glucose. The cultivation was performed at a pH value of in the range of from pH
   7.0 to pH 7.2.
   Determination of the glycostructure:
   For the analysis of IgG glycosylation pattern a method according to Kondo et al.
   (Kondo, A., et al., Agric. Biol. Chem. 54 (1990) 2169-2170) was used. The IgG
25 was purified from the centrifuged supernatant of the cultivation medium using a
   small scale protein A column. The oligosaccharide of the purified IgG was released
   using N-glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and
   labeled with 2-amino         pyridine   at   the   reducing   terminus.  The    labeled
   oligosaccharide was analyzed by reverse-phase chromatography (HPLC). Each
30 peak    was   assigned   by    both mass      spectrometry   and   standards   for  the
   oligosaccharides.

                                           - 22
   Glucose determination:
   The glucose concentration was determined using an YSI 2700 SELECT            analyzer
   (YSI, Yellow Springs, OH, USA) with a method according to the manufacturer's
   manual.
 5 Viable cell density determination:
   Viable Cell density was determined using an automatic image processing and
   analysis system (CEDEX*; Innovatis, Germany) and the trypan blue dye-exclusion
   method.

10 Effects of the DGL control and pH on antibody production and mannose-5
   glycostructure (M5) content
   A test was conducted using a CHO cell strain producing humanized anti-human
   IL-6 receptor antibody (Tocilizumab, RoACTEMRA*), which was prepared in
   accordance with the method described in Referential Example 2 of Japanese
15 Unexamined Patent Publication No. 99902/1996 by use of human elongation factor
   Ia promotor as reported in Example 10 of International Patent Application
   Publication No. WO 92/19759 (corresponding to US 5,795,965, US 5,817,790, and
   US 7,479,543).
   In the constant absolute amount feeding method, effects of pH control on
20 immunoglobulin production were observed. Table 2 shows the effects of pH
   control on antibody oligosaccharides production and M5 content in constant
   feeding mode.

25 At pH 7.0 the amount of the mannose-5 glycostructure (M5) was regulated to less
   than 5.5 %. The DGL value declined from 0.80 to 0.21 due to the change of cell

                                           - 23
   density. On the other hand, at pH 7.2, the M5 amount fluctuated between 8.7 % and
   25.2 % and was higher than that at pH 7.0. The DGL value at pH 7.2 varied from
   0.73 to 0.25. Moreover, in this case, immunoglobulin production at pH 7.2 was
   more than 120 % (relative value compared to pH 7.0). Higher immunoglobulin
 5 production in the constant absolute amount feeding method induces a higher M5
   content of more than 8 %. Therefore, with a pH 7.0 control in the constant absolute
   amount feeding method the M5 content could efficiently be regulated to lower
   values, i.e. below 8 %, compared to pH 7.2 control method.
   The DGL control method (= constant relative amount feeding method) was also
10 used for the immunoglobulin production by fed-batch mode at various pH values,
   and the M5 content was analyzed. Table 3 shows the effects of DGL control after
   the start of feeding at day 2-3 and pH on immunoglobulin production and M5
   content.

15 At pH 7.0 the DGL control method was applied in the range of a DGL of from 0.2
   to 0.8. As a result, the M5 content was regulated to be equal or less than 4.0 %. On
   the other hand, at pH 7.2, the DGL value was operated in the range of from 0.4 to
   0.6. Here the M5 content could be controlled to be less than 5.5 0

   In the single feed experiments a single feed was used containing all nutrients and
   glucose. In the dual feed experiments two feeds were used: the first feed contains
   all nutrients and glucose at a low concentration of 15 g/l and the second feed
   contains a high concentration of glucose. These different feed experiments were
15 performed in one set with a daily adjustment of the feeding rate and in another set
   following a predetermined profile based on the viable cell density development
   recorder in earlier cultivations. As can be seen from Table 5 viability and viable
   cell density are comparable independently of the employed feeding strategy.

   Example 4
   Degree of glucose limitation (DGL) control for immunoglobulin production by
   the fed-batch mode
   CHO cells (8.0 - 12 x 105 cells/ml) were inoculated in serum free culture media as
 5 described above. The cells were grown at 37 'C, 98 % relative humidity, and 10 %
   CO 2 atmosphere. In the fed-batch cultivation the feeding medium containing
   glucose was started to be fed to the main fermenter on the 2 nd or 3rd day from the
   beginning of the cultivation. The feeding strategy followed the method to control
   the degree of glucose limitation (DGL) according to U.S. Patent Application
10 Publication No. US 2006/0127975 Al. The DGL can be defined as the ratio of the
   observed specific glucose consumption rate to the maximum known specific
   glucose consumption rate when glucose is freely available for these cells (DGL          =
   Q(glc)/Q(glc)max ,where Q(glc)    = currently observed specific glucose consumption
   rate; Q(glc)max  =  maximum known specific glucose consumption rate for these
15 cells).
   Figure 1 shows the viable cell density and cell viability profiles of the cultivation.
   The DGL was controlled to be at a value of 0.4 - 0.5 in various cell densities as
   shown in Figure 2. The feeding rates were changed once or twice a day depending
   on the cell density at that time. Figure 3 shows the feeding profiles based on DGL
20 by the fed-batch mode. The feeding rate was changed between 0.8 and 1.6 ml/h
   depending    on    the  cell density.    With this    feeding   strategy applied,      an
   immunoglobulin production profile was obtained as shown in Figure 4. Using the
   inoculation size of 10 x 105 cells/ml and 12 x 105 cells/ml, the immunoglobulin
   production was almost the same and more than 120 % of the immunoglobulin
25 production in constant feeding method at day seven as shown in Table 6 (feeding
   rate of 0.02 g glucose/h). In spite of the 20 % difference in the initial cell densities,
   it was possible with the DGL control method to obtain approximately equivalent
   immunoglobulin titer. Moreover, when the inoculation size was set at 8.0          x   105
   cells/ml, despite the 20 hour delay of the feeding start point, the immunoglobulin
30 obtained was more than 110 % (relative value) at day seven. In these results, the
   DGL control method could achieve a stable immunoglobulin production at various
   inoculation sizes.

      Of the immunoglobulin produced by fed-batch cultivation using the DGL control
 5    the glycosylation pattern was analyzed. Table 6 shows the result of the
      oligosaccharide analysis for the immunoglobulin obtained from the DGL controlled
      fed-batch cultivation in comparison with the constant feeding method (feeding rate:
      0.02 g of glucose/h). At the inoculation size of 8.0 x 10 5 cells/ml, the content of
      mannose-5 glycostructure (M5) was 2.8 %. At the inoculation size of 10 x 105
10    cells/ml and 12 x 105 cells/ml, the M5 content was 4.1 % and 3.8 %, respectively.
      At all cultivation conditions, the DGL control method was able to regulate the M5
      content to less than 5.0 %.
      Meanwhile, in each condition, immunoglobulin G(O) isoform and immunoglobulin
      G(2) isoform were controlled at the range from 40 % to 46 % and from 9.0 % to
15    11 %, respectively.
