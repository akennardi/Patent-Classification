        [0004]       Dihydrotetrabenazine, formed by hydrolysis of the valine ester of NBI
        98854, is subject to extensive oxidative metabolism, including O-demethylation of
        the methoxy groups, as well as hydroxylation of the isobutyl group (Schwartz et al.,
        Biochem. Pharmacol., 1966, 15, 645-655). Adverse effects associated potentially
        associated with the administration of NBI-98854 include neuroleptic malignant
        syndrome, drowsiness, fatigue, nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, agitation,
        confusion, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, dizziness, depression, and
        Parkinsonism.
        Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect
        [0005]       In order to eliminate foreign substances such as therapeutic agents, the
        animal body expresses various enzymes, such as the cytochrome P4 50 enzymes
        (CYPs), esterases, proteases, reductases, dehydrogenases, and monoamine oxidases,
        to react with and convert these foreign substances to more polar intermediates or
        metabolites for renal excretion. Such metabolic reactions frequently involve the
        oxidation of a carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond to either a carbon-oxygen (C-0) or a
        carbon-carbon (C-C) 7c-bond. The resultant metabolites may be stable or unstable
        under physiological conditions, and can have substantially different
        pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and acute and long-term toxicity profiles
        relative to the parent compounds. For most drugs, such oxidations are generally
        rapid and ultimately lead to administration of multiple or high daily doses.
        [0006]       The relationship between the activation energy and the rate of reaction
                                                                  EaciRT
        may be quantified by the Arrhenius equation, k = Ae-             . The Arrhenius
        equation states that, at a given temperature, the rate of a chemical reaction depends
        exponentially on the activation energy     (Eact).
        [0007]       The transition state in a reaction is a short lived state along the reaction
        pathway during which the original bonds have stretched to their limit. By
        definition, the activation energy Eact for a reaction is the energy required to reach
        the transition state of that reaction. Once the transition state is reached, the
        molecules can either revert to the original reactants, or form new bonds giving rise
        to reaction products. A catalyst facilitates a reaction process by lowering the
                                                      2

        activation energy leading to a transition state. Enzymes are examples of biological
        catalysts.
        [0008]       Carbon-hydrogen bond strength is directly proportional to the absolute
        value of the ground-state vibrational energy of the bond. This vibrational energy
        depends on the mass of the atoms that form the bond, and increases as the mass of
        one or both of the atoms making the bond increases. Since deuterium (D) has twice
        the mass of protium ('H), a C-D bond is stronger than the corresponding C-1H
        bond. If a C-1H bond is broken during a rate-determining step in a chemical
        reaction (i.e. the step with the highest transition state energy), then substituting a
        deuterium for that protium will cause a decrease in the reaction rate. This
        phenomenon is known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (DKIE). The
        magnitude of the DKIE can be expressed as the ratio between the rates of a given
        reaction in which a C-1H bond is broken, and the same reaction where deuterium is
        substituted for protium. The DKIE can range from about 1 (no isotope effect) to
        very large numbers, such as 50 or more. Substitution of tritium for hydrogen results
        in yet a stronger bond than deuterium and gives numerically larger isotope effects
        [0009]       Deuterium (2H or D) is a stable and non-radioactive isotope of hydrogen
        which has approximately twice the mass of protium ('H), the most common isotope
        of hydrogen. Deuterium oxide (D 20 or "heavy water") looks and tastes like H 2 0,
        but has different physical properties.
        [0010]       When pure D 2 0 is given to rodents, it is readily absorbed. The quantity
        of deuterium required to induce toxicity is extremely high. When about 0-15% of
        the body water has been replaced by D 20, animals are healthy but are unable to
        gain weight as fast as the control (untreated) group. When about 15-20% of the
        body water has been replaced with D 2 0, the animals become excitable. When
        about 20-25% of the body water has been replaced with D 2 0, the animals become
        so excitable that they go into frequent convulsions when stimulated. Skin lesions,
        ulcers on the paws and muzzles, and necrosis of the tails appear. The animals also
        become very aggressive. When about 30% of the body water has been replaced with
        D 2 0, the animals refuse to eat and become comatose. Their body weight drops
        sharply and their metabolic rates drop far below normal, with death occurring at
        about 30 to about 35% replacement with D 2 0. The effects are reversible unless
        more than thirty percent of the previous body weight has been lost due to D 2 0.

        Studies have also shown that the use of D2 0 can delay the growth of cancer cells
        and enhance the cytotoxicity of certain antineoplastic agents.
        [0011]       Deuteration of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics (PK),
        pharmacodynamics (PD), and toxicity profiles has been demonstrated previously
        with some classes of drugs. For example, the DKIE was used to decrease the
        hepatotoxicity of halothane, presumably by limiting the production of reactive
        species such as trifluoroacetyl chloride. However, this method may not be
        applicable to all drug classes. For example, deuterium incorporation can lead to
        metabolic switching. Metabolic switching occurs when xenogens, sequestered by
        Phase I enzymes, bind transiently and re-bind in a variety of conformations prior to
        the chemical reaction (e.g., oxidation). Metabolic switching is enabled by the
        relatively vast size of binding pockets in many Phase I enzymes and the
        promiscuous nature of many metabolic reactions. Metabolic switching can lead to
        different proportions of known metabolites as well as altogether new metabolites.
        This new metabolic profile may impart more or less toxicity. Such pitfalls are non
        obvious and are not predictable a priorifor any drug class.
        [0012]       NBI-98854 is a VMAT2 inhibitor. The carbon-hydrogen bonds of NBI
        98854 contain a naturally occurring distribution of hydrogen isotopes, namely 'H or
        protium (about 99.9844%), 2H or deuterium (about 0.0156%), and H or tritium (in
        the range between about 0.5 and 67 tritium atoms per 1018 protium atoms).
        Increased levels of deuterium incorporation may produce a detectable Deuterium
        Kinetic Isotope Effect (DKIE) that could effect the pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic
        and/or toxicologic profiles of such NBI-98854 in comparison with the compound
        having naturally occurring levels of deuterium.
        [0013]       Based on discoveries made in our laboratory, as well as considering the
        literature, NBI-98854 is metabolized in humans at the isobutyl and methoxy groups.
        The current approach has the potential to prevent metabolism at these sites. Other
        sites on the molecule may also undergo transformations leading to metabolites with
        as-yet-unknown pharmacology/toxicology. Limiting the production of these
        metabolites has the potential to decrease the danger of the administration of such
        drugs and may even allow increased dosage and/or increased efficacy. All of these
        transformations can occur through polymorphically-expressed enzymes,
        exacerbating interpatient variability. Further, some disorders are best treated when
        the subject is medicated around the clock or for an extended period of time. For all
                                                   4

        of the foregoing reasons, a medicine with a longer half-life may result in greater
        efficacy and cost savings. Various deuteration patterns can be used to (a) reduce or
        eliminate unwanted metabolites, (b) increase the half-life of the parent drug, (c)
        decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect, (d) decrease the
        amount of a dose needed to achieve a desired effect, (e) increase the formation of
        active metabolites, if any are formed, (f) decrease the production of deleterious
        metabolites in specific tissues, and/or (g) create a more effective drug and/or a safer
        drug for polypharmacy, whether the polypharmacy be intentional or not. The
        deuteration approach has the strong potential to slow the metabolism of NBI-98854
        and attenuate interpatient variability.

        unless specifically stated otherwise.
        [0030]         The term "about," as used herein, is intended to qualify the numerical
        values which it modifies, denoting such a value as variable within a margin of error.
        When no particular margin of error, such as a standard deviation to a mean value
        given in a chart or table of data, is recited, the term "about" should be understood to
        mean that range which would encompass the recited value and the range which
        would be included by rounding up or down to that figure as well, taking into
        account significant figures.

        [0032]       The term "deuterium enrichment" refers to the percentage of
        incorporation of deuterium at a given position in a molecule in the place of
        hydrogen. For example, deuterium enrichment of 1% at a given position means that
        1% of molecules in a given sample contain deuterium at the specified position.
        Because the naturally occurring distribution of deuterium is about 0.0156%,
        deuterium enrichment at any position in a compound synthesized using non
        enriched starting materials is about 0.0156%. The deuterium enrichment can be
        determined using conventional analytical methods known to one of ordinary skill in
        the art, including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
        [0033]       The term "is/are deuterium," when used to describe a given position in a
        molecule such as R1-R 29 or the symbol "D", when used to represent a given position
        in a drawing of a molecular structure, means that the specified position is enriched
        with deuterium above the naturally occurring distribution of deuterium. In one
        embodiment deuterium enrichment is no less than about 1%, in another no less than
        about 5%, in another no less than about 10%, in another no less than about 20%, in
        another no less than about 50%, in another no less than about 70%, in another no
        less than about 80%, in another no less than about 90%, or in another no less than
        about 98% of deuterium at the specified position.
        [0034]       The term "isotopic enrichment" refers to the percentage of incorporation
        of a less prevalent isotope of an element at a given position in a molecule in the
        place of the more prevalent isotope of the element.
        [0035]       The term "non-isotopically enriched" refers to a molecule in which the
        percentages of the various isotopes are substantially the same as the naturally
        occurring percentages.
        [0036]       Asymmetric centers exist in the compounds disclosed herein. These
        centers are designated by the symbols "R" or "S," depending on the configuration
        of substituents around the chiral carbon atom. It should be understood that the
        invention encompasses all stereochemical isomeric forms, including diastereomeric,
        enantiomeric, and epimeric forms, as well as d-isomers and 1-isomers, and mixtures
        thereof. Individual stereoisomers of compounds can be prepared synthetically from
        commercially available starting materials which contain chiral centers or by
        preparation of mixtures of enantiomeric products followed by separation such as
        conversion to a mixture of diastereomers followed by separation or
        recrystallization, chromatographic techniques, direct separation of enantiomers on

        [0046]      The term "combination therapy" means the administration of two or
        more therapeutic agents to treat a therapeutic disorder described in the present
        disclosure. Such administration encompasses co-administration of these therapeutic
        agents in a substantially simultaneous manner, such as in a single capsule having a
        fixed ratio of active ingredients or in multiple, separate capsules for each active
        ingredient. In addition, such administration also encompasses use of each type of
        therapeutic agent in a sequential manner. In either case, the treatment regimen will
        provide beneficial effects of the drug combination in treating the disorders
        described herein.

        psychiatric disorder characterized by aggressiveness and a tendency to purposely
        bother and irritate others. According to diagnostic guidelines, oppositional defiant
        disorder is characterized by a repeating pattern of defiant, disobedient, hostile and
        negative behavior toward authority figures. In one embodiment, oppositional
        defiant disorder occurs for at least six months. In one embodiment, oppositional
        defiant disorder occurs more often than other children at the same developmental
        level. In one embodiment, in order to be diagnosed with oppositional defiant
        disorder, children must exhibit four or more of the following symptoms: (1) often
        loses temper, (2) often argues with adults, (3) often actively defies or refuses to
        comply with adults' requests or rules, (4) often blames others for his or her
        misbehavior or mistakes, (5) is often touchy or easily annoyed by others, (6) is
        often angry and resentful, or (7) is often spiteful and vindictive. In one embodiment,
        behaviors that can be expected from a child with oppositional defiant disorder
        include: (1) arguing, (2) claiming not to care about losing privileges as a
        consequence to negative behavior, (3) continually placing blame on others, (4) not

        [0049]       The term "Parkinson's disease levodopa-induced dyskinesia,"
        "levodopa-induced dyskinesia," or "LID" refers to an abnormal muscular activity
        disorder characterized by either disordered or excessive movement (referred to as
        "hyperkinesia" or "dyskinesia"), or slowness, or a lack of movement (referred to as
        "hypokinesia," "bradykinesia," or akinesiaa"). Based on their relationship with
        levodopa dosing, levodopa-induced dyskinesias are classified as peak-dose,
        diphasic, off state, on state, and yo yo dyskinesias. Peak-dose dyskinesias are the
        most common forms of LID and are related to peak plasma (and possibly high
        striatal) levels of levodopa. They involve the head, trunk, and limbs, and sometimes
        respiratory muscles. Dose reduction can ameliorate them, frequently at the cost of
        deterioration of parkinsonism. Peak-dose dyskinesias are usually choreiform,
        though in the later stages dystonia can superimpose. Diphasic dyskinesias develop
        when plasma levodopa levels are rising or falling, but not with the peak levels.
        They are also called D-I-D (dyskinesia-improvement-dyskinesia). D-I-D are
        commonly dystonic in nature, though chorea or mixed pattern may occur. They do
        not respond to levodopa dose reduction and may rather improve with high dose of
        levodopa. "Off" state dystonias occur when plasma levodopa levels are low (for
        example, in the morning). They are usually pure dystonia occurring as painful
        spasms in one foot. They respond to levodopa therapy. Rare forms of LID include
        "on" state dystonias (occurring during higher levels of levodopa) and yo-yo
        dyskinesia (completely unpredictable pattern).
        [0050]       The term "VMAT2" refers to vesicular monoamine transporter 2, an
        integral membrane protein that acts to transport monoamines-particularly
        neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine,serotonin, and histamine
        from cellular cytosol into synaptic vesicles.
        [0051]       The term "VMAT2-mediated disorder," refers to a disorder that is
        characterized by abnormal VMAT2 activity, or VMAT2 activity that, when
        modulated, leads to the amelioration of other abnormal biological processes. A
        VMAT2-mediated disorder may be completely or partially mediated by modulating
        VMAT2. In particular, a VMAT2-mediated disorder is one in which inhibition of
        VMAT2 results in some effect on the underlying disorder e.g., administration of a
                                                   14

        VMAT2 inhibitor results in some improvement in at least some of the patients
        being treated.
        [0052]      The term "VMAT2 inhibitor", "inhibit VMAT2", or "inhibition of
        VMAT2" refers to the ability of a compound disclosed herein to alter the function
        of VMAT2. A VMAT2 inhibitor may block or reduce the activity of VMAT2 by
        forming a reversible or irreversible covalent bond between the inhibitor and
        VMAT2 or through formation of a noncovalently bound complex. Such inhibition
        may be manifest only in particular cell types or may be contingent on a particular
        biological event. The term "VMAT2 inhibitor", "inhibit VMAT2", or "inhibition
        of VMAT2" also refers to altering the function of VMAT2 by decreasing the
        probability that a complex forms between a VMAT2 and a natural substrate. In
        some embodiments, modulation of the VMAT2 may be assessed using the method
        described in WO 2005077946; WO 2008/058261; EP 1716145; Kilbourn et al.,

        [0055]       The terms "active ingredient," "active compound," and "active
        substance" refer to a compound, which is administered, alone or in combination
        with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers, to a subject for
        treating, preventing, or ameliorating one or more symptoms of a disorder.

        symptoms of a disorder.
        [0057]       The term "release controlling excipient" refers to an excipient whose
        primary function is to modify the duration or place of release of the active
        substance from a dosage form as compared with a conventional immediate release
        dosage form.
        [0058]       The term "nonrelease controlling excipient" refers to an excipient whose

        active substance from a dosage form as compared with a conventional immediate
        release dosage form.
        [0059]       The term "prodrug" refers to a compound functional derivative of the
        compound as disclosed herein and is readily convertible into the parent compound
        in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier
        to administer than the parent compound. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by
        oral administration whereas the parent compound is not. The prodrug may also
        have enhanced solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent
        compound. A prodrug may be converted into the parent drug by various
        mechanisms, including enzymatic processes and metabolic hydrolysis. See Harper,

        Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile
        powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.
        [0068]       Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non
        aqueous (oily) sterile injection solutions of the active compounds which may
        contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation
        isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous
        sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.
        Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or
        synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes.
        Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity
        of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran.
        Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which
        increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly
        concentrated solutions.
        [0069]       In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds
        may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may
        be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly)
        or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be
        formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an
        emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble
        derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.
        [0070]       For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions may take the
        form of tablets, lozenges, pastilles, or gels formulated in conventional manner.
        Such compositions may comprise the active ingredient in a flavored basis such as
        sucrose and acacia or tragacanth.
        [0071]       The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as
        suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases
        such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, or other glycerides.
        [0072]       Certain compounds disclosed herein may be administered topically, that
        is by non-systemic administration. This includes the application of a compound
        disclosed herein externally to the epidermis or the buccal cavity and the instillation
        of such a compound into the ear, eye and nose, such that the compound does not
        significantly enter the blood stream. In contrast, systemic administration refers to
        oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal and intramuscular administration.

        [0073]       Formulations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi
        liquid preparations suitable for penetration through the skin to the site of
        inflammation such as gels, liniments, lotions, creams, ointments or pastes, and
        drops suitable for administration to the eye, ear or nose.
        [0074]       For administration by inhalation, compounds may be delivered from an
        insufflator, nebulizer pressurized packs or other convenient means of delivering an
        aerosol spray. Pressurized packs may comprise a suitable propellant such as
        dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon
        dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit
        may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount.
        Alternatively, for administration by inhalation or insufflation, the compounds
        according to the invention may take the form of a dry powder composition, for
        example a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose
        or starch. The powder composition may be presented in unit dosage form, in for
        example, capsules, cartridges, gelatin or blister packs from which the powder may
        be administered with the aid of an inhalator or insufflator.
        [0075]       Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing an effective
        dose, as herein below recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active
        ingredient.
        [0076]       Compounds may be administered orally or via injection at a dose of
        from 0.1 to 500 mg/kg per day. The dose range for adult humans is generally from
        5 mg to 2 g/day. Tablets or other forms of presentation provided in discrete units
        may conveniently contain an amount of one or more compounds which is effective
        at such dosage or as a multiple of the same, for instance, units containing 5 mg to
        500 mg, usually around 10 mg to 200 mg.
        [0077]       The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier
        materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated
        and the particular mode of administration.
        [0078]       The compounds can be administered in various modes, e.g. orally,
        topically, or by injection. The precise amount of compound administered to a
        patient will be the responsibility of the attendant physician. The specific dose level
        for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity
        of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex,
        diets, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug
                                                    22

        combination, the precise disorder being treated, and the severity of the disorder
        being treated. Also, the route of administration may vary depending on the disorder
        and its severity.
        [0079]      In the case wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the
        doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be administered
        chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the
        duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the
        symptoms of the patient's disorder.
        [0080]      In the case wherein the patient's status does improve, upon the doctor's
        discretion the administration of the compounds may be given continuously or
        temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a "drug holiday").
        [0081]      Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a
        maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the
        frequency of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the
        symptoms, to a level at which the improved disorder is retained. Patients can,
        however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of
        symptoms.

        General Synthetic Methods for Preparing Compounds
        [00111]     Isotopic hydrogen can be introduced into a compound as disclosed
        herein by synthetic techniques that employ deuterated reagents, whereby
        incorporation rates are pre-determined; and/or by exchange techniques, wherein
        incorporation rates are determined by equilibrium conditions, and may be highly
        variable depending on the reaction conditions. Synthetic techniques, where tritium
        or deuterium is directly and specifically inserted by tritiated or deuterated reagents
        of known isotopic content, may yield high tritium or deuterium abundance, but can
        be limited by the chemistry required. Exchange techniques, on the other hand, may
        yield lower tritium or deuterium incorporation, often with the isotope being
        distributed over many sites on the molecule.
        [00112]     The compounds as disclosed herein can be prepared by methods known
        to one of skill in the art and routine modifications thereof, and/or following
        procedures similar to those described in the Example section herein and routine

        substitutions can be used. To indroduce deuterium at one or more positions of R30
        R37 , compound 41 with the corresponding deuterium substitutions can be used.
                                                                        45

        [00139]          Deuterium can be incorporated to various positions having an
        exchangeable proton, such as the hydroxyl 0-H or amine N-Hs, via proton
        deuterium equilibrium exchange. For example, to introduce deuterium at R 2 0 and
        R 3 8 -R 3 9, these protons may be replaced with deuterium selectively or non
        selectively through a proton-deuterium exchange method known in the art.
        [00140]          The invention is further illustrated by the following examples. All
        IUPAC names were generated using CambridgeSoft's ChemDraw 10.0.
        [00141]          The following compounds can generally be made using the methods
        described above. It is expected that these compounds when made will have activity
        similar to those described in the examples above.

        [00142]     Changes in the metabolic properties of the compounds disclosed herein
        as compared to their non-isotopically enriched analogs can be shown using the
        following assays. Compounds listed above which have not yet been made and/or
        tested are predicted to have changed metabolic properties as shown by one or more
        of these assays as well.

        In vitro Human Liver Microsomal Stability Assay
        [00143]     Test compounds are dissolved in 50% acetonitrile / 50% H20 for further
        dilution into the assay. Test compounds were combined with microsomes obtained
        from livers of the indicated species in the presence of a NADPH regenerating
        system (NRS) for incubation at 370 C in duplicate. For non-deuterated test
        compounds, the internal standard was the deuterated analog. For deuterated test
        compounds, the internal standard was the non-deuterated form. Samples were
        stored at -70'C for subsequent LC/MS/MS analysis.
