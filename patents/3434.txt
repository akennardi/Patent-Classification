   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Many electronic devices such as mobile phones, mp3 players and digital cameras are charged through
 0 USB ports in either a computer or a USB Alternating Current (AC) adaptor which may be plugged
   into a wall socket or power outlet. Charging devices through a USB port on a computer requires the
   computer to be switched on and also prevents other peripheral devices such as mice and memory
   devices from accessing the port while in use. By using a USB AC adaptor the electronic device may
   be charged at a wall socket or power outlet. One portion of the adaptor has AC prongs which engage
25 into AC receptacles of the wall socket while another portion of the adaptor has a USB port to interface
   with a USB connector of an appliance or electronic device to be charged. The disadvantage with this
   arrangement is that the USB AC adaptor is a separate component that must be purchased and carried
   around and also that the AC prongs will only be suitable for a particular country or region. This leads
   to another drawback with using USB AC adaptors in foreign countries, namely that additional AC
30 adaptors are necessary to engage with sockets found in different areas around the world.
   There are also USB wall outlets wherein the USB charger is integral with the power outlet. Having the
   USB charger integral with the power outlet can lead to increased complexity during installation and
   costly repair and replacement of parts.

25 DESCRIPTION
   Referring now to Figures 1-4, there is shown a USB charging module housing 10 according to a first
   aspect of the present invention. The housing 10 has an aperture 12 through a front face 11 that is large
   enough to provide access for a USB connector to plug into a USB port or socket 50 enclosed within
   the housing (see Figure 7). At the rear of the housing 10 (see Figure 2) is an opening or aperture 13
30 which enables access for inserting a USB charging circuit 60 (see Figure 7) into the housing 10.
   Although this embodiment shows the rear of the housing as being open to provide an access means for
   the USB charging circuit 60, it is possible that the opening 13 could be located on a different face and
   may constitute an entire face or a part thereof. Figure 4 shows a removable cover 20 that engages with
   the rear of the housing 10 to substantially seal the enclosure from dust and ingress. The removable
35 cover 20 has angled clips 26 and 27 that engage into mating apertures 16 and 15 respectively of the
   housing 10 in a snap fit arrangement. The lip of the angled clips 27 are inserted directly into apertures
                                                        7

   15 and then the cover 20 is closed by applying force proximate the clips 26 until they snap into
   apertures 16. The clips 26, 27 are flexible and resilient so that they may bend sufficiently to allow
   fitment into the apertures 15, 16 whereupon they return to their undeformed positions.
 5 In one embodiment, a feature of the housing 10 is the clip interface comprising four clips 14 that are
   positioned around the four side faces of the housing 10. These clips form an engaging portion that
   connects the housing 10 to a supporting portion 30 (see Figure 5) of a surface mountable power outlet.
   The supporting portion 30 may be integral with a grid or face plate of the power outlet or located on a
   mounting plate that is adapted to be connected to the rear of a grid or face plate. Figure 3 shows a
 0 detailed view of a clip 14, in particular illustrating a type of clip with a tapered front face 14b and
   substantially vertical rear face 14a. These clips are designed to engage with the mating interface 34 of
   the supporting portion 30 which is most clearly illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 6 shows detail of a
   typical mating interface 34 which will connect to a USB charging module housing 10. As the housing
   10 is inserted into the supporting portion 30, the tapered surface 14b of the clip 14 will engage a
 5 corresponding tapered surface 35 of the supporting portion 30. As more insertion force is applied, the
   clip 14 will deflect slightly as it passes the vertical surface 37 of the supporting portion 30. The
   substantially vertical rear face 14a of the clip 14 will eventually pass the lowest point of the vertical
   surface 37, upon which it reaches the recessed horizontal surface 36 of the supporting portion 30. The
   compression force acting on the clip 14 is then released and it deflects back to its undeformed position
 0 and the substantially vertical rear face 14a engages in surface to surface contact with the horizontal
   recessed surface 36 of the supporting portion 30 to thereby retain housing 10 to the supporting portion
   30. In the embodiment shown in Figure 5, the supporting portion 30 has only two mating interfaces 34
   requiring that only two of the four clips 14 be used to connect the housing 10 to the supporting portion
   30. In practice, two or more of the clips 14 may be used to secure the housing, and the supporting
25 portion 30 may also have two or more mating interface 34.
   Referring now to Figure 7, there is shown a USB charging module 40 according to an embodiment of
   a second aspect of the present invention. Enclosed inside the housing 10 is a USB port 50 and a USB
   charging circuit 60. Wires 70, 71 to be connected to mains power are soldered directly onto a printed
30 circuit board (PCB) 62 of the charging circuit 60 (see Figure 16). The wires 70, 71 exit the housing 10
   through apertures 22 located through the removable cover 20 (see Figure 10). During installation these
   wires may be connected to mains power either directly or via a switch. In other embodiments, there
   may be simply provided screwed terminals for wire termination instead of a terminal block.
35 Referring now to Figures 8 and 9, there is shown a USB charging module 80 according to another
   embodiment of the second aspect of the present invention. Enclosed inside the housing 10 is USB port
                                                           8

   50 and USB charging circuit 60 with a terminal block 65 to be connected to mains power. During
   installation, wires carrying mains power either directly or via a switch are connected to the terminal
   block 65 to power the USB charging circuit 60. The wires enter the housing 10 through apertures 18
   located on one side of the housing 10.
 5
   In the USB charging module embodiments described above, the power input to the module is mains
   power (also known as household, supply or grid power) supplied between about 100-240V alternating
   current (AC). The USB charging circuit 60 regulates the voltage and steps it down to a usable 4.75
   5.25V direct current (DC) which is typically required to charge many electronic devices.

   Referring now to Figures 11-14, there are shown various embodiments of the USB charging module
   40 or 80 connected to a grid or face plate of a surface mountable power outlet. Figure 11 shows USB
   charging module 40 engaged with a supporting portion 30 which is integral with a grid or face plate
   100. In one example, the supporting portion 30 is integrally machined into the grid or face plate 100
 5 during manufacture. In other embodiments, the supporting portion 30 is provided as a separate piece
   and is attached to the grid or faceplate during or before installation. The grid or face plate 100 can be
   constructed from plastic, metal or any other suitable materials. Figure 11 shows a grid or face plate
   100 with two apertures 102 (only one visible in this view) capable of receiving switches or other
   electrical connectors in addition to USB ports. Further, as the USB charging module is modular in
 0 design, it can always be easily interchanged for a switch or other desired user interface. The grid or
   face plate 100 shown in Figure 11 may be adapted in many ways such as providing for AC receptacles
   as commonly found in most household power outlets. The grid or face plate 100 is fastened to a wall
   by screws or other suitable fasteners through mounting lugs 101. These may be arranged in any
   suitable position on the grid or face plate 100 and may vary in quantity.
25
   Figure 12 shows a USB charging module 80 engaged with a supporting portion 30 located in a
   mounting plate 200 that is adapted to be inserted into the rear of a grid or face plate 110. In this
   arrangement the supporting portion 30 is integrally machined into mounting plate 200. Such a
   mounting plate 200 (also known as a base or base plate) in standard power outlets, commonly includes
30 electrical contacts for AC receptacles, switch mounting and terminals to connect mains power wiring.
   The mounting plate 200 is designed to be received by the rear of a grid or face plate 110. As shown in
   Figure 12, the mounting plate 200 is fastened to the grid or face plate 110 by screws at mounting
   positions 201. The grid or face plate 110 is mounted onto a wall by screws at mounting locations 111,
   112.

   Figure 13 more specifically shows a surface mountable power outlet 500 according to a third aspect of
   the present invention allowing a user to charge USB compatible devices. In this arrangement the USB
   charging module 40 or 80 is connected to a supporting portion 30 that may either by integral with the
   grid or face plate or located on a mounting plate adapted to be connected to the rear of the grid or face
 5 plate. In this embodiment the power outlet 500 has a pair of switches and AC receptacles in addition to
   the USB charging module 40 or 80. A power outlet 500 such as this allows a user to plug in normal
   AC type connectors with power switched on or off and advantageously also provides a user with
   access to a USB port 50 for charging electronic devices. If the USB charging module 40 or 80 is wired
   directly to mains without a switch then the charging module 40 or 80 is constantly connected to mains
 0 power so that when a user connects their device into the USB port, charging will begin automatically.
   If the USB charging module 40 or 80 is wired to mains via a switch, then power will not be drawn
   until the user engages the switch to an "ON" position. As shown in Figure 14 in another embodiment
   of a wall mounted power outlet 510, there is a USB charging module 40 or 80 provided additionally
   with LED status lights 55 that indicate whether the device connected to the port is charging or not. In
 5 both Figures 13 and 14 there is also shown a cover plate 90, 91 that is adapted to fit around the
   periphery of the power outlet. The cover plate 90, 91 usually snap fits around the grid or face plate and
   is provided primarily for aesthetics when the power outlet is mounted to a surface such a wall or floor.
   It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the surface mountable power outlet embodiments
 0 illustrated in this text are by no means limiting to how the invention may be performed. The geometric
   arrangement of switches, AC receptacles, USB ports or other network connection ports may be
   customised to suit a particular application. The supporting portion 30 also need not necessarily be
   limited to being an integral portion of a grid or face plate or located on a mounting plate adapted to be
   inserted into the rear of a grid or face plate. The supporting portion 30 could be mounted or machined
25 into almost any structure, including a box or other structural housing. Further, the engaging portion of
   the USB charging module housing and supporting portion of the power outlet may be designed with
   alternative interfaces to the clip arrangement shown which achieves the principle aim of the invention
   in providing a modular USB housing which is adapted to be installed in a surface mountable power
   outlet thereby allowing a user to charge USB compatible devices.
30
   Referring now to Figures 15-19, there is shown the USB charging circuit 60 that receives a 240V AC
   mains power input and provides a 5V DC output to the USB port 50, suitable for charging USB
   compatible electronic devices. The USB charging circuit 60 comprises the following stages. In the first
   stage, shown in Figure 15, the 240V AC mains input is first stepped down using a transformer 61 to
35 reduce the high AC voltage to a low AC voltage (e.g. 15V, 1.2A). This stepped down AC voltage is
   then passed through a rectifier circuit 63 (e.g. bridge rectifier) that outputs a full wave varying
                                                         10

   rectified voltage shown as the output across load RL. As shown in Figure 16, this varying voltage is
   then smoothed with a capacitor to produce a relatively smooth DC voltage with a small ripple. A
   voltage regulator (e.g. 7812 Integrated Circuit (IC)) is then used to output a regulated 12V DC output
   as will be understood by the person skilled in the art.
 5
   In the second stage, an embodiment of which is shown in Figure 16, a DC-DC converter (e.g. Texas
   Instruments TPS402 10 current mode boost controller) is then used to regulate the output suitable for
   the USB charger. The TPS40210 implements a DC-DC single-ended primary inductance converter
   (SEPIC) with input and output current regulation, as well as output voltage regulation implemented by
 0 closed loop feedback control. The TPS402 10 ensures that the output voltage of the USB charger is
   between about 4.75 and 5.25 V (nominally 5V DC) with an operating current of about 1A and also
   prevents overcharging. The voltage input in Figure 16 is the regulated 12V from the first stage, which
   is converted to a regulated 5V DC voltage output by the circuit shown. It should be understood that
   this is just one example of how a USB charging circuit may be implemented and any other suitable
 5 circuit arrangement may be used.
   Referring specifically to Figures 17 and 18 there is shown an embodiment of the physical circuit
   layout of the USB charging circuit 60. A double layered PCB 62 is used which provides a compact
   and efficient way to house all of the components inside the housing 10. On one layer of the PCB 62
 0 there is mounted the USB port 50, an optional terminal block 65 and the circuit components for the
   AC mains voltage step down and first stage regulation (including transformer, capacitors, 7812 IC
   voltage regulator and rectifier circuit). On the second layer of the PCB 62 there is provided the power
   conditioning circuitry for the USB charger output (including the TPS402 10 and various other
   capacitors, inductors, resistors and diodes).
25
   In other embodiments, there is provided 2 or 3 or more PCBs over which the circuit components are
   arranged, rather than (or as well as) a double layered arrangement.
   Referring now to Figures 19a-19c there is shown a sequential series of views of a method of installing
30 the USB charging module 80 to a surface mountable power outlet according to a fourth aspect of the
   present invention. In this embodiment, the mounting surface is a wall 90. In Figure 19a there is shown
   the step of connecting the engaging portion of the USB charging module housing 10 to a supporting
   portion 30 of the power outlet. Figure 19a shows the USB charging module 80 already having been
   engaged with the supporting portion 30. Figure 19b illustrates the next step of connecting the mains
35 power to the USB charging circuit 60. The USB charging module 80 and grid or face plate assembly is
   held in close proximity to a wall opening where the power outlet is to be located. The wiring from the
                                                        11

   mains (typically active and neutral wires, with earth optional) is physically connected to the USB
   charging circuit 60. The particular embodiment illustrated in Figures 19a-19c shows a USB charging
   module 80 with a terminal block 65 for terminating the mains wires. The final step in the installation is
   to attach or mount the power outlet to the wall 90 as illustrated in Figure 19c. The grid or face plate is
 5 held flat against the wall 90 and screws or other suitable fastening means are inserted through
   mounting apertures in the grid or face plate and fastened securely to the wall 90. In another example,
   the USB charging module 40 may be connected using wires 70, 71 as previously described.
   Figure 20 illustrates a flow diagram of a method of installing the USB charging module 40 or 80 to a
 0 surface mountable power outlet. In step 600, the installer begins with the USB charging module. In
   step 601, the engaging portion of the USB charging module housing 10 is connected to the supporting
   portion 30 of the power outlet. In step 602, a determination is made as to whether the supporting
   portion is located in a mounting plate that is not integral with the grid or faceplate. If the supporting
   portion 30 is integral with the grid or face plate, the mains power is connected to the USB charging
 5 circuit 60 and the power outlet is attached or mounted to the mounting surface (which may be a wall
   or floor or other appropriate surface) in step 604. If the supporting portion 30 is located in a mounting
   plate that is not integral with the grid or face plate, then there is an additional step 603 of connecting
   the mounting plate to the grid or face plate.
 0 In step 605, the installer then connects the AC mains power to the USB and then in step the power
   outlet assembly is mounted or attached to the mounting surface such as the wall 90 or a floor. In step
   606, the resulting product of the method is a surface mounted USB power or charging outlet.
   Once installation is complete, the power outlet provides an interface to charge USB compatible
25 devices. The USB charging module 40,80 receives a mains input power between about 100-240V AC
   and converts this to a regulated 5V DC output suitable for charging USB compatible electronic
   devices. The modular housing 10 enables the power outlet to have interchangeable interfaces to suit
   operational requirements. The USB charging module 40,80 may be removed from the power outlet
   and replaced with a switch or any other interface without having to replace the entire power outlet.
30
   Referring now to Figures 21-27, there is shown a further embodiment whereby the USB charging
   module 40,80 is connected to the supporting portion 130 of a grid or face plate 120 of a surface
   mountable power outlet from the front thereby providing a 'front entry' insertion option. Whereas
   previously described the USB charging module 40,80 is connected into a supporting portion 30 in the
35 rear of the grid or face plate, it is also desirable to be able to insert the module from the front of the
   grid or face plate. It will be appreciated that this connection may be facilitated in many ways, an
                                                           12

   example of which is shown in Figures 21-27. Figure 21 generally shows a USB charging module
   40,80 which can be connected to mains power as previously described. In one form, the module may
   have a clip interface comprising clips 18 as shown in more detail in Figures 22-23. Figure 23 is a front
   view of a USB charging module housing 10 showing the location of two clips 18 suitable for front
 5 entry connection of the module. Figure 22 is a sectional view through A-A of Figure 23 providing
   detail of a possible clip arrangement. This clip arrangement allows the housing 10 to engage with a
   supporting portion 130 of a grid or face plate 120 as shown in Figure 25. Figure 24 shows as a
   sectional view through B-B of Figure 25 which generally shows the supporting portion 130 in more
   detail. The housing 10 of the USB charging module 40,80 is inserted through aperture 132 of the
 0 supporting portion 130. The clip arrangement facilitates a snap-fit connection between the clips 18 and
   the supporting portion 130. As the module is inserted into the grid or face plate, the resilient clips 18
   bend slightly as force is applied such that the outer most surface 18b of the clips 18 can pass the inner
   most surface 133 of the supporting portion 130.Once engaged, surface 19 of the housing 10 mates with
   recessed surface 131 of the supporting portion 130 and surface 18a of the clips 18 is in contact with
 5 surface 134 of the supporting portion 130.
   Figures 26-27 show exploded views of the USB charging module 40,80 and grid or face plate front
   entry installation. Figure 26 shows a grid or face plate 120 with two apertures 132 which enables more
   than one USB charging module 40,80 to be inserted. Figure 27 shows a grid or face plate 140 with a
 0 single aperture 132 for receiving a USB charging module 40,80 from the front. In addition, Figure 27
   shows a cover plate 145 that is attached or mounted to the grid or face plate after the USB charging
   module 40,80 has been connected and screws 146 for attaching or mounting the grid or face plate to a
   surface such as a wall or floor.
