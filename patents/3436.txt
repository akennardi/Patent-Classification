                        PROBIOTIC GRAIN-BASED COMPOSITIONS
                                   RELATED APPLICATIONS
        This application is a divisional application of Australian Application No. <removed-apn>,
filed on 25 February 2016, which is a divisional of Australian Application No. 2009305668,
filed on 16 October 2009, and is related to International Patent Application No.
PCT/US2009/060983, filed on 16 October 2009 and claims priority from U.S. Provisional
Patent Application No. 61/106,116, filed on 16 October 2008; each of which is incorporated
herein by reference in its entirety.
                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
        The present application relates to probiotic grain-based compositions comprising lactic
acid-producing bacteria.
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
        The gastrointestinal microflora plays a number of vital roles in maintaining
gastrointestinal tract function and overall physiological health. The growth and metabolism of
the many individual bacterial species inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract depend primarily upon
the substrates available to them, most of which are derived from the diet. Since probiotics do
not generally permanently colonize the host, they need to be ingested regularly for any health
promoting properties to persist.
                               SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
        The invention is based on the discovery that lactic acid-producing bacteria, particularly
Bacillus species, remain viable and retain their beneficial probiotic properties in food
compositions, such as those prepared at high temperatures (e.g., 80, 90, 100, 120, or 150'C) in
boiling water. The invention describes probiotic grain-based compositions. Specifically, the
invention provides an isolated Bacillus coagulans bacterium in a grain-based composition.
                                                   1

        The invention provides compositions comprising a cooked or uncooked composition of a
grain and an isolated Bacillus coagulans bacterium or spore. The grain is processed, e.g., altered
from its naturally-occurring state. For example, the grain is husked, crushed, cracked, or ground.
The grain is in the form of flour or a composition made from further manipulation of a grain
based flour. Exemplary grains include wheat, rice, buckwheat, barley, Kamut, corn and oats.
Exemplary cooked compositions include pasta, oatmeal, and grits. Suitable pastas include egg
pasta, spaghetti (solid, thin cylinders), macaroni (tubes or hollow cylinders), fusilli (spiral
shaped), lasagna (sheets), tagliatelle (flat ribbons), vermicelli (thin spaghetti), ravioli (filled
pasta), spitzle and gnocchi. Other suitable pastas include penne rigate (furrowed cylinder
shaped pasta), penne lisce (smooth cylinder-shaped pasta), rotini (corkscrew-shaped pasta), and
rigatoni (tube-shaped pasta).
        In one aspect, the isolated Bacillus coagulans comprise between about 0.01% to about
50% by weight of the grain-based composition. Optionally, the isolated Bacillus coagulans
comprise between about 0.01% and about 10% by weight of the grain-based composition.
Preferably, the isolated Bacillus coagulans comprise between about 0.010% and about 0.10%by
weight of the grain-based composition.
        The invention also provides bacterial species including Bacillus coagulans, e.g., Bacillus
coagulans hammer, preferably Bacillus coagulans hammer strain Accession No. ATCC 31284,
or one or more strains derived from Bacillus coagulans hammer strain Accession No. ATCC
31284 (e.g., ATCC Numbers: GBI-20, ATCC Designation Number PTA-6085; GBI-30 or BC,
ATCC Designation Number PTA-6086; and GBI-40, ATCC Designation Number PTA-6087;
see U.S. Patent No. 6,849,256 to Farmer).
        Optionally, the isolated Bacillus coagulans is in the form of a spore. In one aspect, the
Bacillus coagulans spores activate upon contacting hot liquid. Preferably, the hot liquid is water
                                                   2

or milk. Alternatively, the isolated Bacillus coagulans is in the form of a vegetative cell. In
another aspect, the isolated Bacillus coagulans is in the form of a mixture of vegetative cells and
spores. Preferably, the Bacillus coagulans is predominantly in spore form, e.g., about 75%,
                    85
about 80%, about       %, about 90%, about 95%, about 99%, or about 100% spores.
        The invention also provides compositions comprising a dry mix for grain-based
compositions comprising a grain and an isolated Bacillus coagulansbacterium. Also provided
are compositions comprising a dry mix for soup comprising a dehydrated matter and an isolated
Bacillus coagulansbacterium.
        Also provided are methods of making a grain-based composition comprising providing a
grain-containing base mix and a liquid portion; mixing the grain-containing base mix and the
liquid portion to form a batter or dough; combining an isolated Bacillus coagulans bacterium
with the batter or dough; and heat processing the batter or dough to cook the grain-based
composition. Suitable liquid portions include water and milk. In one aspect, the isolated
Bacillus coagulansis in the form of a spore. In another aspect, the isolated Bacillus coagulans is
in the form of a vegetative cell. In one aspect, the isolated Bacillus coagulans comprise between
about 0.10%to about 50% by weight of the grain-based composition. Preferably, the isolated
Bacillus coagulans comprise between about 1% and about 10% by weight of the grain-based
composition. Most preferably, the amount of Bacillus coagulans bacteria is about 5 x 107 colony
forming units (CFU) of bacteria per gram of food matrix.
        Bacillus coagulans bacteria are included in the grain-based or soup compositions of this
invention. Bacterial species include Bacillus coagulans, e.g., Bacillus coagulanshammer,
preferably Bacillus coagulans hammer strain Accession No. ATCC 31284, or one or more
strains derived from Bacillus coagulans hammer strain Accession No. ATCC 31284 (e.g., ATCC
Numbers: GBI-20, ATCC Designation Number PTA-6085; GBI-30 or BC3, ATCC Designation
                                                   3

Number PTA-6086; and GBI-40, ATCC Designation Number PTA-6087; see U.S. Patent No.
6,849,256 to Farmer).
        In one aspect, the isolated Bacillus coagulans is in the form of a spore. The invention
provides for the activation of Bacillus coagulans spores upon heating. Optionally, the isolated
Bacillus coagulans is in the form of a vegetative cell. In another aspect, the isolated Bacillus
coagulans is in the form of a mixture of vegetative cells and spores.
        The Bacillus coagulans Hammer strains of the invention are non-pathogenic and
generally regarded as safe for use in human nutrition (i.e., GRAS classification) by the U.S.
Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and by
those skilled in the art. Furthermore, the Bacillus coagulansHammer strains of the invention
germinate at or below human body temperature, rendering them useful as probiotics. Many
Bacillus coagulans strains outside the Hammer group have mostly industrial applications, little
or no nutritional benefit, and environmental contaminants that have not been evaluated for
safety. Moreover, many other non-Hammer strains of Bacillus coagulans grow optimally at
temperatures that exceed human body temperature and, thus, do not germinate efficiently in the
human body. Such strains are less or not suitable as probiotics for human consumption.
        Cited publications are incorporated herein by reference. Both the foregoing general
description and the following detailed description and examples are exemplary and explanatory
only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.

                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
         Probiotic organisms are non-pathogenic, non-toxigenic, retain viability during storage,
and survive passage through the stomach and small intestine. Non-pathogenic lactic acid
producing bacteria (i.e., "lactic acid bacteria"), such as the exemplary Bacillus coagulans,
remain viable and retain their beneficial probiotic properties in grain-based and soup
compositions, such as those prepared in boiling water. Specifically, the probiotic organisms
described herein, e.g., Bacillus coagulans strain GBI-30 or BC30, ATCC Designation Number
PTA-6086, survive the harsh manufacturing and cooking processes of the grain-based and soup
compositions described below.
Probiotic lactic acid-producing bacteria
         A probiotic lactic acid-producing bacteria suitable for use in the methods and
compositions of the invention produces acid and is non-pathogenic. There are many suitable
bacteria identified as described herein, although the invention is not limited to currently known
bacterial species insofar as the purposes and objectives of the bacteria is described. The property
of acid production is important to the effectiveness of the probiotic lactic acid-producing bacteria
of this invention.
         The invention provides using a lactic acid-producing bacteria, such as a spore-forming
Bacillus species, such as B. coagulans. Preferably, the spore-forming Bacillus species of the
invention is B. coagulans Hammer.
         Exemplary methods and compositions are described herein using Bacillus coagulans as a
probiotic. Purified and/or isolated Bacillus coagulans is particularly useful as a probiotic in
                                                    5

grain-based or soup compositions. Probiotic B. coagulans is non-pathogenic and is generally
regarded as safe (i.e., GRAS classification) by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and by those skilled in the art.
        Bacillus coagulans is a non-pathogenic gram positive spore-forming bacteria that
produces L(+) lactic acid (dextrorotatory) in fermentation conditions. It has been isolated from
natural sources, such as heat-treated soil samples inoculated into nutrient medium (Bergey's
Manual off Systemic Bacteriology, Vol. 2, Sneath, P.H.A., et al., eds., Williams & Wilkins,
Baltimore, MD, 1986). Purified B. coagulans strains have served as a source of enzymes
including endonucleases (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,200,336); amylase (U.S. Patent No. 4,980,180);
lactase (U.S. Patent No. 4,323,651); and cyclo-malto-dextrin glucano-transferase (U.S. Patent
No. 5,102,800). B. coagulanshas been used to produce lactic acid (U.S. Patent No. 5,079,164).
A strain of B. coagulans (referred to as L. sporogenes; Sakaguti & Nakayama (ATCC 31284))
has been combined with other lactic acid producing bacteria and B. natto to produce a fermented
food product from steamed soybeans (U.S. Patent No. 4,110,477).
        Bacterial species include Bacillus coagulans, e.g., Bacillus coagulans hammer,
preferably Bacillus coagulans hammer strain Accession No. ATCC 31284, or one or more
strains derived from Bacillus coagulans hammer strain Accession No. ATCC 31284 (e.g., ATCC
Numbers: GBI-20, ATCC Designation Number PTA-6085; GBI-30, ATCC Designation Number
PTA-6086; and GBI-40, ATCC Designation Number PTA-6087; see U.S. Patent No. 6,849,256
to Farmer).
        Bacillus coagulans was previously mis-characterized as a Lactobacillus and labeled as
Lactobacillus sporogenes (See Nakamura et al. 1988. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 38: 63-73).
However, initial classification was incorrect because Bacillus coagulans produces spores and
excretes L(+)-lactic acid through metabolism. Both of these characteristics provide key features
                                                  6

to the utility of Bacillus coagulans. These developmental and metabolic aspects required that the
bacterium be classified as a lactic acid Bacillus. In addition, it is not generally appreciated that
classic Lactobacillus species are unsuitable for colonization of the gut due to their instability in
the harsh (i.e., acidic) pH environment of the bile, particularly human bile. By contrast, Bacillus
coagulans is able to survive and colonize the gastrointestinal tract in the bile environment and
even grown in this low pH range.
Probiotic activity of Bacillus coagulans
         It is well-documented clinically that many species of bacterial, mycotic and yeast
pathogens possess the ability to cause a variety of gastrointestinal disorders including, but not
limited to: disruption of normal gastrointestinal biochemical function, necrosis of gastrointestinal
tissues, and disruption of the bioabsorption of nutrients, and like conditions. The probiotic
microorganism-containing compositions described herein inhibit these pathogens. Thus, the
compositions are useful in the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of conditions associated with
infection by these aforementioned pathogens.
         In one aspect, a Bacillus coagulans strain is included in the composition in the form of
vegetative cells. In another aspect, the Bacillus coagulans strain is included in the composition
in the form of spores. The invention also provides for including the Bacillus coagulans strain in
the composition in the form of a powder, a dried cell mass, a stabilized paste, or a stabilized gel.
           Because Bacillus spores are heat and pressure-resistant and can be stored as a dry
powder, they are particularly useful for formulation into and manufacture of products such as the
various grain-based and soup compositions described herein. A Bacillus species is well suited
for the present invention, particularly species having the ability to form spores which are
relatively resistant to heat and other conditions, making them ideal for storage (shelf-life) in
product formulations, e.g., grain-based and soup compositions. Due to the shelf-stable properties
                                                   7

of the Bacillus coagulans strains described herein, e.g., Bacillus coagulans strain GBI-30 or
BC30, ATCC Designation Number PTA-6086, the product formulations of the invention are not
confined to a refrigerator and may be stored at room temperature.
        The Bacillus coagulans of the invention survives storage (shelf-life) from about 12 days
to about 2 years; from about 1 month to about 18 months; from about 3 months to about 1 year;
or from about 6 months to about 9 months.
Anti-microbial probiotic activity
        The probiotic organisms described herein, e.g., Bacillus coagulans strain GBI-30 or
BC3U, ATCC Designation Number PTA-6086, promote digestive health and support the immune
system. The ability of Bacillus coagulans to inhibit various bacterial pathogens was
quantitatively ascertained by use of an in vitro assay. This assay is part of a standardized
bacterial pathogen screen (developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA)) and is
commercially available on solid support disks (DIFCO BACTROL* Antibiotic Disks). To
perform the assay, potato-dextrose plates (DIFCO*) were initially prepared using standard
procedures. The plates were then individually inoculated with the bacteria (approximately
1.5x10 6 CFU) to be tested so as to form a confluent bacterial bed.
        Inhibition of microorganisms (e.g. gastrointestinal pathogens) by Bacillus coagulanswas
subsequently ascertained by placing approximately 1.8 x 106 CFU of Bacillus coagulans in 10 tl
of broth or buffer, directly in the center of the potato-dextrose plate with one test locus being
approximately 8 mm in diameter per plate. A minimum of three test loci were used for each
assay. The negative control consisted of a 10 tl volume of a sterile saline solution, whereas the
positive control consisted of a 1 tl volume of glutaraldehyde. The plates were then incubated for
approximately about 18 hr at 30 0 C, at which time the zones of inhibition were measured. As
                                                    8

designated herein, "excellent inhibition" means the zone was 10 mm or greater in diameter; and
"good inhibition" means the zone was greater than 2 mm in diameter but less than 10 mm in
diameter.
        As expected, no "inhibition" was seen with the negative, saline control, and excellent
"inhibition" (approximately 16.2 mm diameter; average of three tests) was seen with the
positive, glutaraldehyde control. For the enteric microorganisms tested, the following inhibition
by Bacillus coagulans was found: (i) Clostridium species - excellent inhibition; (ii) Escherichia
coli - excellent inhibition; (iii) Clostridium species - excellent inhibition, where the zone of
inhibition was consistently greater than 15 mm in diameter. Similarly, excellent inhibition was
also seen for the opportunistic pathogens Pseudornonasaeruginosa,and Staphylococcus aureus.
Pathogenic enteric bacteria which were inhibited by Bacillus coagulans activity include, but are
not limited to: Staphylococcus aureus;Staphylococcus epidermidis;Streptococcuspyogenes;
Pseudomonas aeruginosa;Escherichiacoli (enterohemorragic species); numerous Clostridium
species (e.g., Clostridiumperfingens, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium tributrycum,
Clostridium sporogenes, and the like); Gardnereiavaginails;Proponbacteriumaenes;
Aeromonas hydrophia; Aspergillus species; Proteus species; and Klebsiella species.
Micro-encapsulation
        In one aspect, the lactic-acid producing bacteria are incorporated into a microcapsule
coating prior to addition to the grain-based composition, using any micro-encapsulation process
well-known in the art. The isolated Bacillus coagulans are packaged, or encapsulated, within
another material in order to protect the bacteria from the surrounding environment. The capsules
of the invention range in size from one-thousandth of a millimeter to seven millimeters. The
internal ingredients of the microcapsule are released from their shells in various ways, including
mechanical rupture of the capsule wall, dissolution of the wall, melting of the wall and diffusion
                                                   9

through the wall. Thus, micro-encapsulation provides additional protection to the isolated
Bacillus bacterium during heat processing of the grain-based compositions of the invention.
Physical methods of micro-encapsulation include pan coating, air-suspension coating, centrifugal
extrusion, vibrational nozzle, and spray-drying. Chemical methods of micro-encapsulation
include interfacial polymerization, in-situ polymerization, and matrix polymerization.
        Alternatively, the lactic-acid producing bacteria is added to the grain-based composition
without micro-encapsulation.
Probiotic grain-based and soup compositions
        The invention is directed to the surprising discovery that lactic acid-producing bacteria,
particularly Bacillus species, remain viable and retain their beneficial probiotic properties in
grain-based and soup compositions, such as those prepared in boiling water. The compositions
are prepared by combining dry matter and a liquid, e.g., water or milk. In one aspect, the
composition is prepared by combining dry matter and a liquid, and heating the resulting
combination. Optionally, the combination is heated (heat-processed) using applied heat, a flame,
or a microwave. The grain-based or soup composition is boiled in hot water, e.g., stovetop
boiling, addition of boiling water to a container, or microwaving the grain-based or soup
composition along with water. Preferably, boiling water (about 1000 C ) is added to a
combination of grain-based composition and Bacillus coagulans bacteria.
        In one aspect, at least about 5 %-2 5 % of the bacteria are viable after heating, e.g., at least
about 2 5 %-5 0%; at least about 50% to 75%; or at least about    7 5 %-9 9 % of the bacteria are viable
after heating. As the recommended dietary allowances (RDA or recommended daily intake;
RDI) is about 1 x 109 bacterium (according to EU guidelines), preferably, the grain-based or
soup composition comprises at least about 1 x 109 viable bacteria after heating. In another
                                                   10

aspect, the grain-based or soup composition comprises at least about 1 x 106 to 1 x 107; at least
about 1 x 107 to 1 x 10 ; or at least about 1 x 108 to 1 x 109 viable bacteria after heating.
        The compositions are formulated in many configurations, because the bacterium is
present as a vegetative cell or as a spore, or both, depending on the species and form of the
probiotic organism. The cells/spores are formulated in a variety of compositions suited for use in
a grain-based or soup composition. In one aspect, the bacterium is present as a mixture of spores
and vegetative cells. In another aspect, the bacterium is present as at least 90% spores, e.g.,
95%, 98%, or 99% spores. Optionally, prior to addition to the grain-based or soup compositions
of the invention, the Bacillus coagulans cells are cultured in liquid in the absence of or with
limited quantities of a food source to induce sporulation. In another aspect, heat gun spray
drying kills about 50%, about 75%, about 90%, about 95%, or about 99% of vegetative cells
prior to addition to the grain-based or soup compositions of the invention.
         Grain-based compositions, such as those described herein, are made from a variety of
grains known to those skilled in the art. Suitable grains include rice, wheat, maize, barley, rye,
oats, buckwheat, sorghum, millets, triticale, fonio, and quinoa. Other types of grains used to
make the grain-based compositions of the invention include teff, wild rice, and durum.
        Exemplary grain-based compositions include pasta, oatmeal, grits, cereal, etc. The
invention provides probiotic-enhanced pasta, e.g., isolated Bacillus coagulans and pasta. Pasta
(Italian for "dough") is a generic term for Italian variants of noodles, food made from a dough of
flour, water and/or eggs. Pasta is cooked in hot water/boiling water prior to consumption. The
probiotic organisms described herein, e.g., Bacillus coagulans strain GBI-30 or B30, ATCC
Designation Number PTA-6086, uniquely survive the harsh manufacturing and cooking
processes of the grain-based and soup compositions. In one aspect, the pasta is the primary
ingredient, served with sauce or seasonings. Common varieties of pasta include tubular pasta,
                                                   11

straight round rod pasta, ribbon pasta, micro pasta, stuffed pasta, and irregular-shaped pasta.
Exemplary pastas include spaghetti (solid, thin cylinders), macaroni (tubes or hollow cylinders),
fusilli (spiral-shaped), lasagna (sheets), tagliatelle (flat ribbons), vermicelli (thin spaghetti), and
ravioli (filled pasta). Other suitable pastas include penne (cylinder-shaped pasta), rotini
(corkscrew-shaped pasta), and rigatoni (tube-shaped pasta). In Italy, penne are produced in two
variants: "penne lisce" (smooth) and "penne rigate" (furrowed), the latter having ridges on each
noodle. Two other noodles, gnocchi and spitzle, are sometimes counted as pasta because they
are traditional in Italy; however, their "native" distributions (and perhaps their origins) are
outside Italy, and these noodles have more in common with dumplings than with typical pasta.
The two basic styles of pasta are dried and fresh. Dried pasta has a firmer, denser texture when
cooked and is suited to chunky, meaty or oily sauces. Fresh pasta has a softer, more absorbent
texture and is suited to buttery or creamy sauces or sauces with delicate flavors. There are also
variations in the ingredients used in pasta. The time for which pasta can be stored varies from
days to years depending upon whether the pasta is made with egg or not, and whether it is dried
or fresh.
         Many ingredients are used to make pasta dough, ranging from a simple flour and water
mixture, to those that call for the addition of eggs, spices and cheeses, or even squid ink to the
dough. Optionally, the pasta contains a filling, e.g., cheese, vegetables, fruit, and/or meat. In
one aspect, dry pasta is made from durum wheat or semolina flour. Durum flour has a yellow
tinge in color. Alternatively, dry pasta is made from other types of flour (such as farina), which
yields a softer product. Particular varieties of pasta may also use other grains and/or milling
methods to make the flour. Some pasta varieties, such as Pizzoccheri, are made from buckwheat
flour. Various types of fresh pasta include eggs (egg pasta). Gnocchi are often considered pasta
dishes, although they are quite different in ingredients (mainly milled potatoes).
                                                    12

        Also provided are probiotic grain-based compositions in the form of oatmeal with
isolatedBacillus coagulans. Oatmeal is a product of ground oat groats (i.e., oat-meal, cornmeal,
peasemeal, etc.) or a porridge made from this product (also called oatmeal cereal). In regions
such as the United States and Canada, "oatmeal" can refer to other products made from oat
groats, such as cut oats, crushed oats, and rolled oats. The groats are coarsely ground to make
oatmeal, or cut into small pieces to make steel-cut oats, or steamed and rolled to make rolled
oats. In the case of rolled oats (old-fashioned oats), oat groats are steamed, pressed with a roller,
and dried. Rolled oats take about 15 minutes to cook. The quick-cooking rolled oats ("quick
oats") are cut into small pieces before being steamed and rolled. "Instant" oatmeal is pre-cooked
and dried. Optionally, the oatmeal includes: sweetener and flavor additives. Suitable sweeteners
and flavor additives include salt, white sugar, brown sugar, stevia, cinnamon, honey, jam,
molasses, maple syrup, butter, chocolate, soy sauce, soy milk, milk, vinegar, condensed or
evaporated milk, and cream. Various types of fruit and nuts are also often added, including:
strawberries, blueberries, apples, peaches, mangos, bananas, raisins, dried cherries, dried
cranberries, pecans, walnuts, and peanut butter. Oatmeal is used to make porridge, as an
ingredient as in oatmeal cookies and oat cakes, or as an accent as in the topping on many oat
bran breads and the coating on Caboc cheese. Oatmeal is used as a thickener in some foods such
as canned chili con care.    Oatmeal is also used in some alcoholic drinks, cosmetics, soaps,
external medical treatments, and is sometimes added to animal feed products.
        In another aspect, the probiotic composition of the invention is grits with isolated
Bacillus coagulans. Grits is an American Indian corn-based food common in the southern
United States, consisting of coarsely ground corn. Traditionally the corn for grits is ground by a
stone mill. The results are passed through screens, with the finer part being corn meal, and the
coarser part being grits.
                                                  13

         Also provided are probiotic instant soups including isolated Bacillus coagulans in soups
that require hot water. Soup is a food that is made by combining ingredients such as meat and
vegetables in stock or hot/boiling water, until the flavor is extracted, forming a broth.
Traditionally, soups are classified into two broad groups: clear soups and thick soups. Thick
soups are classified depending upon the type of thickening agent used: purses are vegetable
soups thickened with starch; bisques are made from pur6ed shellfish thickened with cream;
cream soups are thickened with bechamel sauce; and velout6s are thickened with eggs, butter and
cream. Other ingredients commonly used to thicken soups and broths include rice, flour, and
grain. Oriental-style soup mixes containing ramen noodles are marketed as an inexpensive
instant lunch, requiring only hot water for preparation. Various types of soups include tomato
soup, cream of mushroom soup, chicken noodle soup, vegetable beef soup, minestrone soup, leek
and potato soup, lentil soup, fish soup, miso soup, pea soup, fruit soup, clam chowder, gumbo,
and bisque. Many soups, such as vegetable, chicken base, potato, pasta and cheese soups, are
also available in dry mix form, ready to be served by adding hot water. Dry mix soup includes
dehydrated matter, e.g., dehydrated meat, such as poultry and beef, dehydrated vegetables,
dehydrated herbs, dehydrated spices, dehydrated noodles, etc. A packet of dry soup stock (e.g.,
ramen) typically does not contain water. The instant soup is prepared by adding water first, and
then heating the product for a short time (usually 3-5 minutes) or by adding hot water directly to
the dry soup mix. Instant soup can also be preserved into a dry powder which can be stored in,
e.g., a packet or a cup. Bacillus coagulans bacteria in the form of spray-dried powder is added
prior to or subsequent to addition of the dry mix soup powder to hot water.
         In one aspect, Bacillus coagulansbacteria in the form of a spray-dried powder is included
in or on the surface of the probiotic grain-based composition described herein. Preferably, the
isolatedBacillus coagulans is in the form of a spore. The isolated Bacillus coagulans are at least
                                                  14

85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 99% pure spores. Alternatively, the isolated Bacillus
coagulans is in the form of a vegetative cell. In one aspect, the isolated Bacillus coagulans are at
least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95% pure vegetative cells. In another aspect, the isolated
Bacillus coagulans is in the form of a mixture of vegetative cells and spores. The Bacillus
coagulans mixture is 90% spores, 10% vegetative cells; 75% spores, 25% vegetative cells; 60%
spores, 40% vegetative cells; 50% spores, 50% vegetative cells; 60% vegetative cells, 40%
spores; 75% vegetative cells; 25% spores; or 90% vegetative cells, 10% spores.
        The Bacillus and/or Bacillus coagulans isolated active agent is applied using any of a
variety of known methods including, for example, applying a powder, spray-drying the probiotic
onto the grain-based or dry mix soup composition, or soaking the composition in a solution
containing the probiotic. Optionally, the Bacillus bacterium is added to the dough and dried into
the product (e.g., pasta). Alternatively, the Bacillus bacterium is mixed with the dry mix product
(e.g., oatmeal or soup) prior to boiling in water. In another aspect, Bacillus coagulans bacteria in
the form of spray-dried powder is added directly to the grain-based or soup composition itself.
In yet another aspect, maltodextrin along with Bacillus coagulans bacteria in the form of spray
dried powder is added directly to the grain-based or soup composition itself. Optionally, about 5
x 107 CFU Bacillus coagulans bacteria (per gram of food matrix) in the form of spray-dried
powder along with maltodextrin is added directly to the food composition itself.
        Any of a variety of methods for placing the bacterial composition into a grain-based or
soup composition can be used. However, preferred methods include a "spray-dry" method in
which the compositions are exposed in a low humidity chamber to an atomized mix containing a
liquid composition, where the chamber is subsequently exposed to approximately 80-1 10'F to
dry the liquid, thereby impregnating the material of grain-based or dry mix soup composition
with the components.
                                                  15

        A typical concentration is from approximately      Ix107  to IxIO1 CFU; 1x108 to 1x1
CFU; or 1x10 9 to 1x101 0 CFU of viable bacterium or spores/g of food matrix. Following drying,
the food is ready for immediate use or for storage in a sterile package, e.g., a 3-ounce package, a
6-ounce package, a 9-ounce package, a 12-ounce package, a 15-ounce package, an 18-ounce
package, or a 24-ounce package.
         The active ingredients (i.e., live bacteria or extracellular components), comprise between
about 0.010%to about 10%; 0.010%to about 1%; or about 0.05% to about 0.1 % by weight of the
probiotic grain-based or soup composition. Optionally, the isolated Bacillus coagulans comprise
about 1 mg to about 10 g; about 10 mg to about 1 g; or about 25 mg to about 75 mg by weight of
the probiotic composition. Most preferably, the amount of Bacillus coagulansbacteria is about 5
x 107 colony forming units (CFU) of bacteria per gram of food matrix.
        In one aspect, the amount of bacteria is about 104 to 101 colony forming units (CFU) of
bacteria per gram of probiotic composition (i.e., vegetative cells and/or bacterial spores),
preferably 105 to 1013 CFU/g of food matrix. Alternatively, the concentrations are 108 to 1013
CFU/g; 109 to 1012 CFU/g; or 1010 to 1011 CFU/g of food matrix. In one aspect, the amount of
bacteria is about 1 x 106 CFU per gram of food matrix. The actual amount in a grain-based or
soup composition will vary depending upon the amounts of composition to be dispersed into the
food composition and upon routes of dispersal.
        In one aspect, the invention provides for storing the grain-based or dry mix soup
composition in a sterile package at room temperature prior to consumption. Alternatively, the
composition is consumed immediately.
        In another aspect, the composition comprises at least 8 5%, at least 9 0%, at least 95% or
100% isolatedBacillus coagulans spores.
                                                    16

         By way of example, and not of limitation, Bacillus coagulans spores may be incorporated
into any type of dry or lyophilized product which is dissolved or mixed with hot water, so long
as the temperature of the Bacillus coagulans spore-containing mixture is raised to the required
heat-shock temperature (i.e., 80'C for 5 minutes) necessary for germination of the spores. The
Bacillus coagulans spores may either be incorporated into the dry or lyophilized product by the
manufacturer of the product or by the consumer during preparation. These dry or lyophilized
products include, but are not limited to: dry mix soups, pasta, oatmeal, grits, etc. The grain
based or soup composition is subsequently boiled in hot water, e.g., stovetop boiling, addition of
boiling water to a container, or microwaving the grain-based or soup composition along with
water.
         In one aspect, the Bacillus coagulans spores survive storage (shelf-life), i.e., retain
viability or the ability to germinate at physiological conditions (e.g., ingestion), from about 12
days to about 2 years; from about 1 month to about 18 months; from about 3 months to about 1
year; or from about 6 months to about 9 months.
Example 1:      Preparation of Bacillus coagulans cultures
         Bacillus coagulansHammer bacteria (ATCC Accession No. 31284) was inoculated and
grown to a cell density of about 108 to 109 cells/ml in nutrient broth containing 5 g Peptone, 3 g
Meat extract, 10-30 mg MnSO 4 , and 1,000 ml distilled water, adjusted to pH 7.0, using a standard
airlift fermentation vessel at 30'C. The range of MnSO 4 acceptable for sporulation is 1 mg/l to
1 g/l. The vegetative cells can actively reproduce up to 45'C, and the spores are stable up to
90'C. After fermentation, the B. coagulans bacterial cells or spores are collected using standard
methods (e.g., filtration, centrifugation) and the collected cells and spores can be lyophilized,
                                                  17

spray-dried, air-dried or frozen. As described herein, the supernatant from the cell culture is
collected and used as an extracellular agent secreted by B. coagulans.
         A typical yield from the above culture is in the range of about 109 to 1010 viable spores
and more typically about 100 to 150 billion cells/spores per gram before drying. Spores maintain
at least 90% viability after drying when stored at room temperature for up to ten years, and thus
the effective shelf life of a composition containing B. coagulans Hammer spores at room
temperature is about 10 years.
Example 2:       Preparation of Bacillus coagulans spores
         A culture of dried B. coagulans spores was prepared as follows. Ten million spores were
inoculated into a one liter culture containing 24 g potato dextrose broth, 10 g of enzymic-digest
of poultry and fish tissue, 5 g of FOS and 10 g MnSO4. The culture was maintained for 72 hours
under a high oxygen environment at 37'C to produce culture having about 150 billion cells per
gram of culture. Thereafter, the culture was filtered to remove culture medium liquid, and the
bacterial pellet was resuspended in water and freeze-dried. The freeze-dried powder is then
ground to a fine powder using standard good manufacturing practice (GMP).
Example 3: Bacillus coagulans spores survive in the gastric environment
         This study was performed in order to determine the survivability rate of Bacillus
coagulans spores as they pass through the stomach. Samples of Bacillus coagulans spores were
subjected to a simulated gastric environment for varying lengths of time in order to attain their
survivability rate. First, a homogeneous sample of raw material Bacillus coagulans of at least 12
grams was prepared. Saline solution at pH 1 was prepared using 3N HCl (150 mls each into six
250 ml media bottles) and sterilized. Additional saline solutions with pH 2 and 3 were prepared
similarly, resulting in 6 sterile 250 ml bottles, each containing 150 ml pH adjusted saline. Six
sterile 250 ml media bottles each containing 150 ml normal saline solution were prepared and
                                                   18

sterilized. Phosphate buffer (-400 ml) was prepared at pH 7.2. Test tubes (24) were prepared
and sterilized, each containing 9 ml of phosphate buffer pH 7.2. Test tubes (120) were prepared,
each containing 9 ml of normal saline. GYE (glucose-yeast extract) agar medium was prepared
and sterilized and cooled to 45'C in a water bath. Samples (24) of raw material were weighed,
each ~ 500 milligrams (theoretically equivalent to 10 billion spores). The samples were added to
media bottles at 37'C and incubated half for 20 minutes the other half for 120 minutes. After 20
and 120 minutes incubation, respectively, the samples were mixed to uniformity and pipet 1 ml
into 9 ml of sterile phosphate buffer pH 7.2. After all 12 samples from each time point were
placed into test tubes containing sterile phosphate buffer, serial dilutions were made until 6 tubes
had been used for each sample. The final dilution for the final two test tubes were 3 x 107 and 3
x 108, which gave a count of roughly 300 and 30 CFU, respectively. The final 2 test tubes from
each sample were placed into 70'C water bath for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, they were
cooled immediately to 45'C. Three sterile petri plates per tube were set out. 1.0 ml from the
heat-treated tube was added into each petri plate, then 15 ml of sterile molten GYE Agar medium
(at 45'C) was poured into each of the petri plates and mixed thoroughly. When solidified, the
plates were incubated in an inverted position for 48 hours at 40'C. The individual colonies were
counted. Results were expressed as CFU per gram as shown in Table 1 below. 1.OE+10 = 1 x
1010

Example 4: Bacillus coagulans retain viability in gnocchi (potato pasta)
       The purpose of the following study was to determine the survivability rate of GBI-30
(Bacilluscoagulans-30; BC 30 ) in gnocchi (potato pasta) after cooking and pasteurization. BC30
                                                20

was mixed into gnocchi (potato pasta) at the dose of 5 x 107 CFU/g of food matrix, spray dried,
and boiled in water at 100 C for 1 minute and 30 seconds. The potato pasta was subsequently
pasteurized for 1 hour and 20 minutes at 95'C. Following pasteurization, the potato pasta was
cooked at 100 0 C for 1 minute and 30 seconds to simulate home cooking. The pasta was stored at
4'C for 30 days (shelf life is 60 days), heat shocked at approximately 80'C for about 5 minutes,
and placed in GYE agar medium. The results demonstrate that approximately 1.3 x 107 CFU of
Bacillus coagulansper gram of food matrix survived even after storage for about 30 days.
Comparable results were observed after heat shock (thermiz), suggesting that after the cooking
process, the pasta comprises mostly Bacillus coagulans spores and few vegetative cells. The
potato pasta was packaged in a modified atmosphere. The water activity (A,) of the composition
was approximately 0.95%. The data in Figure 1 show that after pre-boiling, pasteurization, and
cooking, the amount of BC 3 0 in the potato pasta was 3 x 106 CFU/g of food matrix, suggesting
that the approximate daily dose of probiotics in 100 g of gnocchi is about 1.3 x 109 CFU or 100%
RDA (1 billion viable cells is the recommended dose in EU guidelines).
Example 5: Bacillus coagulans retain viability in fresh egg pasta
        This study was performed in order to determine the survivability rate of GBI-30 (Bacillus
coagulans-30; BC3U) in fresh egg pasta after pasteurization. BC3U was mixed into the fresh egg
pasta with cheese, vegetables, and meat filling at the dose of 5 x 107 CFU/g of food matrix. The
fresh egg pasta was subsequently spray dried and pasteurized for approximately 5 minutes at
100'C. The shelf life of the fresh egg pasta was 50 days. The pasta was packaged in a modified
atmosphere. The water activity (A,) of the composition was approximately 0.92-0.97%. The
results illustrated in Figure 2 demonstrate that approximately 2 x 107 CFU of BC 30 survived the
pasteurization described above, indicating that Bacillus coagulans retain viability in the fresh
egg pasta.

Example 6: Survival of heat-activated Bacillus coagulans
         The ability of GBI-30 (Bacilluscoagulans-30; BC 3 0) in oatmeal to survive heating via
microwave was determined. Table 2 demonstrates that approximately 82% of the BC 30 alone
survived microwaving for 1 minute and 50 seconds. As shown in Table 2, approximately 79% of
the initial Bacillus coagulansbacteria in oatmeal survived after microwaving for 1 minute and 50
seconds, suggesting that Bacillus coagulans retain viability in oatmeal after cooking. Table 2
shows the survival of BC30 after heat treatment under various conditions.

Example 8: Bacillus coagulans retain viability in durum wheat semolina pasta
        The purpose of the following study was to determine the survivability rate of GBI-30
(Bacillus coagulans-30; BC30) in durum wheat semolina pasta after cooking. BC30 was mixed
into the durum wheat semolina pasta at the dose of about 4 x 108 CFU/serving (about 7 x 106
CFU/g of food matrix (about 30 mg of BC 30); serving size is about 56 grams). The composition
was extruded at 37-38'C, followed by 20 hours of drying at 50'C. Table 4 shows the survival
of BC 30 after manufacturing the dry pasta and after cooking the dry pasta via boiling for about 8
minutes. The results shown in Table 4 demonstrate that approximately 55% of BC 30 survive the
manufacturing process, while approximately 30% of BC30 survive the cooking process,
indicating that Bacillus coagulansBC30 retain viability in durum wheat semolina pasta.
