   The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent Application No.
   2015347440, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
   Technical Field
10 Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to an appliance for dehumidification and an
   appliance for dehumidification or humidification configured to control humidity.
   Background Art
   In general, an appliance for dehumidification is an apparatus configured to remove moisture in
15 air.  The appliance for dehumidification may largely be divided into a drying-type appliance
   for dehumidification and a cooling-type appliance for dehumidification.        The drying-type
   appliance for dehumidification is provided with a method to perform a dehumidification by
   absorbing or adsorbing moisture in air by use of moisture an absorbent material, which is
   chemical substance, and the cooling-type appliance for dehumidification is provided with a
20 method to condense vapor in air by cooling the temperature of the air below the dew point by
   use of a cooling cycle apparatus.
   In the cooling-type appliance for dehumidification, when the temperature of the air
   surrounding a cooling apparatus of the cooling-type appliance for dehumidification falls below
   the dew point, condensation water is generated at the cooling apparatus, and a water container
25 configured to store the condensation water descending from the cooling apparatus is provided
   under the cooling apparatus.

   apparatus or a heat-exchanging apparatus, to absorb latent heat of an outside by evaporating
   the refrigerant and to condense the vapor of the surrounding air, a drain duct 130 to guide
   condensation water generated from the evaporator 122, a water collecting tray 131 to collect

   the condensation water that is guided by use of the drain duct 130, a water container 150
   detachably provided at an upper portion of the body 110 as to drain the condensation water, a
   pump 132 to pump the condensation water collected at the water collecting tray 131 to the
   water container 150, and a drain pipe 133 to guide the condensation water pumped by the
 5 pump 132 to the water container 150 at the upper portion of the body 110.
   Air that flows inwardly through the inflow unit 115 is cooled and dehumidified after passing
   through the evaporator 122, and is heated after passing through the condenser 121, and then
   the air that is dry may outflow through the outflow unit 116.
   However, the appliance for dehumidification, other than the method of using the cooling cycle
10 apparatus, may perform a dehumidification by use of the method using adsorbent material.

   the evaporator 122.
   The draft fan 125 may be rotated by receiving rotational force from a driving motor 125a.
25 The draft fan 125, after receiving air from a rear of the body 110, may forcedly move the air to
   flow toward the upper side of a front of the body 110 after the air is sequentially passed
   through the evaporator 122 and the condenser 121.           An inside of the body 110 may be
   provided with an air current guiding unit 126 to guide the current of air. The draft fan 125

   guiding unit 126 at a position corresponding to the outflow unit 116 of the body 110.     Various
   electronic boxes 118 may be provided at a lower portion of the body 110.
   This structure, as the air that inflows into an inside of the body 110 is cooled below the dew
   point at the evaporator 122, the vapor included in the air is condensed, and the air that is dried

   is heated after passing through the condenser 121 and the heated air may flow to an outside of
   the body 110 in a state of having a lower relative humidity.
   The condensation water condensed at the evaporator 122 flows downward along the
   evaporator 122, and descends below the evaporator 122, and the drain duct 130 may be
 5 provided below the evaporator 122 as to guide the descended condensation water.
   The drain duct 130 is provided to guide condensation water to the water collecting tray 131,
   and for the above, the drain duct 130 may be inclined toward the water collecting tray 131.
   The drain duct 130 is provided in a size capable of covering the entire area of the evaporator
   122.
10   The water collecting tray 131 may store condensation water.          In the embodiment of the
   present disclosure, the drain duct 130 and the water collecting tray 131 are separately formed,
   but the drain duct 130 and the water collecting tray 131 may be integrally formed.
   A water level sensor (not shown) may be provided at the water collecting tray 131.     When the
   water level of the water collecting tray 131 reaches full or at a certain level, the pump 132 is
15 driven and the condensation water of the water collecting tray 131 may be pumped.
   The pump 132 may be a centrifugal pump structured with a motor (not shown) to generate
   rotational force and rotational wings (not shown) to be rotated by receiving the rotational force
   from the motor (not shown).        The condensation water pumped by the pump 132 may be

   into the hollow hole 957 of the water container 950.
   At the time of mounting the water container 950 at the body 910, the water container 950 is
15 moved in a direction from an upper side to a lower side as to insert the guide unit 980 of the
   body 910 into the hollow hole 957 of the water container 950.
   On the contrary, at the time of separating the water container 950 at the body 910, the water
   container 950 is moved in a direction from a lower side to an upper side as to release the guide
   unit 980 of the body 910 from the hollow hole 957 of the water container 950.
20 As the above, by having the guide unit 980 vertically inserted into the hollow hole 957 of the
   water container 950, the mounting and the separating of the water container 950 may be easily
   performed.    In addition, an unexpected separation of the water container 950 in a process of
   moving the body 910 in a state that the water container 950 is mounted at the body 910 may be
   prevented.
25 An inside of the guide unit 980 may be provided with the guide path 927, which is described
   above.    As the above, the space utilization of the appliance for dehumidification 900 may be
   increased as the guide path 927 is formed at the inside of the guide unit 980.
   An upper surface 981 of the guide unit 980 may be exposed to an outside even in a state that
   the water container 950 is mounted.      The upper surface 981 of the guide unit 980 may be
30 provided with a display unit 982 (FIG. 38) to display a variety of motion information of the
   appliance for dehumidification 900, and a control unit 983 (FIG. 38) through which a variety
   of motion commands may be input at the appliance for dehumidification 900.          The display
   unit 982 may be structured with a LCD panel having a segment 7 display apparatus.           The
   control unit 983 may include one of more of various buttons, a knob, and a touch panel.

   As the above, as the upper surface 981 of the guide unit 980 is provided with the display unit
   982 and the control unit 983, a user may easily use the display unit 982 and the control unit
   983 even in a state that the water container 950 is mounted at an upper portion of the body
   910.
