    FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to polypeptides,
    polynucleotides encoding same, transgenic plants expressing same and methods of producing
 [5 and using same, and, more particularly, but not exclusively, to methods of increasing plant
    yield, oil yield, seed yield, biomass, growth rate, vigor, oil content, abiotic stress tolerance
    and/or nitrogen use efficiency.
            Abiotic stress conditions such as salinity, drought, flood, suboptimal temperature and
    toxic chemical pollution, cause substantial damage to agricultural plants.      Most plants have
  0 evolved strategies to protect themselves against these conditions. However, if the severity and
    duration of the stress conditions are too great, the effects on plant development, growth and
    yield of most crop plants are profound.        Furthermore, most of the crop plants are highly
    susceptible to abiotic stress (ABS) and thus necessitate optimal growth conditions for
    commercial crop yields. Continuous exposure to stress causes major alterations in the plant
25  metabolism which ultimately leads to cell death and consequently yield losses.
            The global shortage of water supply is one of the most severe agricultural problems
    affecting plant growth and crop yield and efforts are made to mitigate the harmful effects of
    desertification and salinization of the world's arable land. Thus, Agbiotech companies attempt
    to create new crop varieties which are tolerant to different abiotic stresses focusing mainly in
30  developing new varieties that can tolerate water shortage for longer periods.
            Suboptimal nutrient (macro and micro nutrient) affect plant growth and development
    through the whole plant life cycle. One of the essential macronutrients for the plant is Nitrogen.
    Nitrogen is responsible for biosynthesis of amino acids and nucleic acids, prosthetic groups,

                                                 la
  plant hormones, plant chemical defenses, and the like.      Nitrogen is often the rate-limiting
  element in plant growth and all field crops have a fundamental dependence on inorganic
  nitrogenous fertilizer. Since fertilizer is rapidly depleted from most soil types, it must be
  supplied to growing crops two or three times

                   Vegetable or seed oils are the major source of energy and nutrition
                                                                                            in human
         and animal diet. They are also used for the production of industrial
                                                                                  products, such as
    5    paints, inks and lubricants. In addition, plant oils represent renewable
                                                                                   sources of long
         chain hydrocarbons which can be used as fuel. Since the currently used
                                                                                     fossil fuels are
        finite resources and are gradually being depleted, fast growing biomass

        used as alternative fuels or for energy feedstocks and may reduce the

  10    plant oils as bio-fuel is the oil price, which is still higher than fossil fuel [Hypertext

     DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
                 The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to isolated
30   polypeptides and polynucleotides encoding same, and more particularly, but not
     exclusively, to methods of using same for increasing oil content, growth rate, yield,

                                                      10
                   Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be
        understood that the invention is not necessarily limited in its application to the details
        set forth in the following description or exemplified by the Examples. The invention is
        capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways.
   5              While reducing the present invention to practice, the present inventors have
        identified novel polypeptides and polynucleotides which can be used to increase yield,
        growth rate, biomass, oil content, vigor, abiotic stress tolerance and/or nitrogen use
        efficiency of a plant.
                  Thus, as shown in the Examples section which follows, the present inventors
 10    have utilized bioinformatics tools to identify polynucleotides which enhance yield (e.g.,
       seed yield, oil yield and oil content), growth rate, biomass, vigor, abiotic stress tolerance
       and/or nitrogen use efficiency of a plant. Genes which affect the trait-of-interest were
       identified based on expression profiles of genes of several Arabidopsis ecotypes and
       tissues, homology with genes known to affect the trait-of-interest and using digital
 15    expression profile in specific tissues and conditions (Tables 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and
       11, Examples 1 and 3). Homologous polypeptides and polynucleotides having the same
      function were also identified (Table 2, Example 2). Transgenic plants over-expressing
      the identified polynucleotides exhibit increased seed yield (e.g., weight of 1000 seeds),
      oil yield (e.g., oil percentage in seed), biomass (e.g., dry matter), harvest index, growth
20    rate, rosette area, abiotic stress tolerance (e.g., to drought conditions) and nitrogen use
      efficiency (Tables 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27; Examples 5 and 7; Tables 28-30, Example
      8). In addition, the present inventors have uncovered that polynucleotides which reduce
      the expression level and/or activity of certain gene products (e.g., the BDL127 gene;
      SEQ ID NO:17 or 673) can increase yield (e.g., seed yield), biomass and/or growth rate
25   in plants (Tables 31-36; Example 9). As is further shown in the Examples section which
     follows, the present inventors have uncovered novel promoter sequences which can be
     used to express the gene-of-interest in a tissue specific and/or developmental stage
     specific manner (Tables 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21, Example 6). , Altogether, these
     results suggest the use of the polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention for

                  Thus, according to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention, there is
       provided method of increasing oil content, yield, growth rate, biomass, vigor, abiotic
       stress tolerance and/or nitrogen use efficiency of a plant, comprising expressing within
       the plant an exogenous polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid sequence at least 80 %
   5   identical to SEQ ID NOs:18, 1-16, 19-50, 101-378, 657-672, 674-706, 716-719, 724
       741 and 755-763 with the proviso that the nucleic acid sequence is not as set forth by
       SEQ ID NO:756 or 762, thereby increasing the oil content, yield, growth rate, biomass,
       vigor, abiotic stress tolerance and/or nitrogen use efficiency of the plant.
                  The phrase "oil content" as used herein refers to the amount of lipids in a
  10   given plant organ, either the seeds (seed oil content) or the vegetative portion of the
       plant (vegetative oil content) and is typically expressed as percentage of dry weight (10
       % humidity of seeds) or wet weight (for vegetative portion).
                 It should be noted that oil content is affected by intrinsic oil production of a
      tissue (e.g., seed, vegetative portion), as well as the mass or size of the oil-producing
 15   tissue per plant or per growth period.
                 In one embodiment, increase in oil content of the plant can be achieved by
      increasing the size/mass of a plant's tissue(s) which comprise oil per growth period.
      Thus, increased oil content of a plant can be achieved by increasing the yield, growth
      rate, biomass and vigor of the plant.
 20             As used herein the phrase "plant yield" refers to the amount (as determined by
      weight or size) or quantity (numbers) of tissue produced per plant or per growing
      season. Hence increased yield could affect the economic benefit one can obtain from
     the plant in a certain growing area and/or growing time.
                It should be noted that a plant yield can be affected by various parameters
25   including, but not limited to, plant biomass; plant vigor; growth rate; seed yield; oil
     yield; content of oil, starch and/or protein in harvested organs (e.g., seeds or vegetative
     parts of the plant); number of flowers (florets) per panicle (expressed as a ratio of
     number of filled seeds over number of primary panicles); harvest index; number of
     plants grown per area; number and size of harvested organs per plant and per area;
30   number of plants per growing area (density); number of harvested organs in field; total
     leaf area; carbon assimilation and carbon partitioning (the distribution/allocation of
     carbon within the plant); resistance to shade; number of harvestable organs (e.g. seeds),

      WO 2009/141824                                                         PCT/IL2009/000508

       seeds per pod, weight per seed; and modified architecture [such as increase stalk
       diameter, thickness or improvement of physical properties (e.g. elasticity)] .
                 As used herein the phrase "plant biomass" refers to the amount (measured in
      grams of air-dry tissue) of a tissue produced from the plant in a growing season, which
  5   could also determine or affect the plant yield or the yield per growing area. An increase
      in plant biomass can be in the whole plant or in parts thereof such as aboveground
      (harvestable) parts, vegetative biomass, roots and seeds.
                 As used herein the phrase "growth rate" refers to the increase in plant organ
      size per time (can be measured in cm2 per day).
 10              As used herein the phrase "plant vigor" refers to the amount (measured by
      weight) of tissue produced by the plant in a given time. Hence increased vigor could
      determine or affect the plant yield or the yield per growing time or growing area. In
     addition, early vigor (seed and/or seedling) result with improved field stand.
                As used herein the phrase "seed yield" refers to the number or weight of the
 15  seeds per plant, seeds per pod, or per growing area or to the weight of a single seed, or
     to the oil extracted per seed. Hence seed yield can be affected by seed dimensions (e.g.,
     length, width, perimeter, area and/or volume), number of (filled) seeds and seed filling
     rate and by seed oil content.      Hence increase seed yield per plant could affect the
     economic benefit one can obtain from the plant in a certain growing area and/or
20  growing time; and increase seed yield per growing area could be achieved by increasing
     seed yield per plant, and/or by increasing number of plants grown on the same given
    area.
                The term "seed" (also referred to as "grain" or "kernel") as used herein refers
    to a small embryonic plant enclosed in a covering called the seed coat (usually with
25  some stored food), the product of the ripened ovule of gymnosperm and angiosperm
    plants which occurs after fertilization and some growth within the mother plant.
               It should be noted that a plant yield can be determined under stress (e.g.,
    abiotic stress, nitrogen-limiting conditions) or non-stress (normal) conditions.
               As used herein, the phrase "non-stress conditions" refers to the growth
30  conditions (e.g., water, temperature, light-dark cycles, humidity, salt concentration,
    fertilizer concentration in soil, nutrient supply such as nitrogen, phosphorous and/or
    potassium), which enable normal metabolism, growth, reproduction and/or viability of a

                                                      13
        plant at any stage in its life cycle (from seed to mature plant and back to seed again). It
        should be noted that while the non-stress conditions may include some mild variations
        from the optimal conditions (which vary from one type/species of a plant to another),
        such variations do not cause the plant to cease growing without the capacity to resume
   5   growth.
                  The phrase "abiotic stress" as used herein refers to any adverse effect on
       metabolism, growth, reproduction and/or viability of a plant. Accordingly, abiotic
       stress can be induced by suboptimal environmental growth conditions such as, for
       example, salinity, water deprivation, flooding, freezing, low or high temperature, heavy
  10   metal toxicity, anaerobiosis,       nutrient  deficiency, atmospheric pollution     or UV
       irradiation. The implications of abiotic stress are discussed in the Background section.
                  The phrase "abiotic stress tolerance" as used herein refers to the ability of a
      plant to endure an abiotic stress without suffering a substantial alteration in metabolism,
      growth, productivity and/or viability.
 15              As used herein the phrase "nitrogen use efficiency (NUE)" refers to the
      metabolic process(es) which lead to an increase in the plant's yield, biomass, vigor,
      growth rate and abiotic stress tolerance per nitrogen unit applied. The metabolic process
      can be the uptake, spread, absorbent, accumulation, relocation (within the plant) and use
      of nitrogen absorbed by the plant.
 20              As used herein the phrase "nitrogen-limiting conditions" refers to growth
      conditions which include a level (e.g., concentration) of nitrogen (e.g.,, ammonium or
      nitrate) applied which is below the level needed for normal plant metabolism, growth,
     reproduction and/or viability.
                 As used herein the term "increasing" refers to at least about 2 %, at least about
25   3 %, at least about 4 %, at least about 5 %, at least about 10 %, at least about 15 %, at
     least about 20 %, at least about 30 %, at least about 40 %, at least about 50 %, at least
     about 60 %, at least about 70 %, at least about 80 %, increase in oil content, yield,
     growth rate, biomass, vigor, abiotic stress tolerance and/or nitrogen use efficiency of a
     plant as compared to a native plant [i.e., a plant not modified with the biomolecules
30   (polynucleotide or polypeptides) of the invention, e.g., a non-transformed plant of the
     same species which is grown under the same growth conditions).

               As used herein, the phrase        "exogenous polynucleotide"       refers to a
    heterologous nucleic acid sequence which may not be naturally expressed within the
    plant or which overexpression in the plant is desired. The exogenous polynucleotide
    may be introduced into the plant in a stable or transient manner, so as to produce a
 5  ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule and/or a polypeptide molecule. It should be noted that
    the exogenous polynucleotide may comprise a nucleic acid sequence which is identical
    or partially homologous to an endogenous nucleic acid sequence of the plant.
              According     to  some   embodiments      of the   invention    the   exogenous
   polynucleotide comprises a nucleic acid sequence which is at least about 80 %, at least
10 about 81 %, at least about 82 %, at least about 83 %, at least about 84 %, at least about
   85 %, at least about 86 %, at least about 87 %, at least about 88 %, at least about 89 %,

   about 93 %, at least about 94 %, at least about 95 %, at least about 96 %, at least about
   97 %, at least about 98 %, at least about 99 %, e.g., 100 % identical to the nucleic acid
15 sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs:18, 1-16, 19-50, 101-378,
   657-672, 674-706, 716-719, 724-741 and 755-763 with the proviso that the nucleic acid
   sequence is not as set forth by SEQ ID NO:756 or 762.
              Identity (e.g., percent homology) can be determined using any homology
   comparison software, including for example, the BlastN software of the National Center
20 of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) such as by using default parameters.
              According     to  some   embodiments      of the   invention    the    exogenous
   polynucleotide is at least about 80 %, at least about 81 %, at least about 82 %, at least
   about 83 %, at least about 84 %, at least about 85 %, at least about 86 %, at least about
   87 %, at least about 88 %, at least about 89 %, at least about 90 %, at least about 91 %,

30 NO:756 or 762.

                According     to  some    embodiments     of the    invention    the exogenous
      polynucleotide is set forth by SEQ ID NO:18, 1-16, 19-50, 101-378, 657-672, 674-706,
      716-719, 724-741, 755, 757-761 or 763.
                In exemplary embodiments the exogenous polynucleotide               is not the
  5  polynucleotide set forth by SEQ ID NO:807 or 808.
               As used herein the term "polynucleotide" refers to a single or double stranded
     nucleic acid sequence which is isolated and provided in the form of an RNA sequence, a
     complementary polynucleotide sequence (cDNA), a genomic polynucleotide sequence
     and/or a composite polynucleotide sequences (e.g., a combination of the above).
 10            The term "isolated" refers to at least partially separated from the natural
     environment e.g., from a plant cell.
               As used herein the phrase "complementary polynucleotide sequence" refers to
     a sequence, which results from reverse transcription of messenger RNA using a reverse
     transcriptase or any other RNA dependent DNA polymerase. Such a sequence can be
 15  subsequently amplified in vivo or in vitro using a DNA dependent DNA polymerase.
               As used herein the phrase "genomic polynucleotide sequence" refers to a
     sequence derived (isolated) from a chromosome and thus it represents a contiguous
    portion of a chromosome.
               As used herein the phrase "composite polynucleotide sequence" refers to a
20  sequence, which is at least partially complementary and at least partially genomic. A
    composite sequence can include some exonal sequences required to encode the
    polypeptide of the present invention, as well as some intronic sequences interposing
    therebetween. The intronic sequences can be of any source, including of other genes,
    and typically will include conserved splicing signal sequences. Such intronic sequences
25  may further include cis acting expression regulatory elements.
               According    to   some   embodiments      of the   invention,    the exogenous
    polynucleotide of the invention encodes a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at
    least about 80 %, at least about 81 %, at least about 82 %, at least about 83 %, at least
    about 84 %, at least about 85 %, at least about 86 %, at least about 87 %, at least about
30  88 %, at least about 89 %, at least about 90 %, at least about 91 %, at least about 92 %,
    at least about 93 %, at least about 94 %, at least about 95 %, at least about 96 %, at least
    about 97 %, at least about 98 %, at least about 99 %, or more say 100 % homologous to

      the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs:68, 51-66,
      69-100, 379-656, 707-715, 720-723, 742-754 and 764-772 with the proviso that the
      amino acid sequence is not as set forth by SEQ ID NO: 765 or 771.
                Homology (e.g., percent homology) can be determined using any homology
  5  comparison software, including for example, the BlastP or TBLASTN software of the
     National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) such as by using default
     parameters, when starting from a polypeptide sequence; or the tBLASTX algorithm
     (available via the NCBI) such as by using default parameters, which compares the six
     frame conceptual translation products of a nucleotide query sequence (both strands)
 10  against a protein sequence database.
               Homologous sequences include both orthologous and paralogous sequences.
     The term "paralogous" relates to gene-duplications within the genome of a species
     leading to paralogous genes. The term "orthologous" relates to homologous genes in
     different organisms due to ancestral relationship.
 15            One option to identify orthologues in monocot plant species is by performing a
    reciprocal blast search. This may be done by a first blast involving blasting the
    sequence-of-interest against any sequence database, such as the publicly available NCBI
    database which may be found at: Hypertext Transfer Protocol://World Wide Web (dot)
    ncbi (dot) nlm (dot) nih (dot) gov. If orthologues in rice were sought, the sequence-of
20  interest would be blasted against, for example, the 28,469 full-length cDNA clones from
    Oryza sativa Nipponbare available at NCBI. The blast results may be filtered. The full
    length sequences of either the filtered results or the non-filtered results are then blasted
    back (second blast) against the sequences of the organism from which the sequence-of
    interest is derived. The results of the first and second blasts are then compared. An
25  orthologue is identified when the sequence resulting in the highest score (best hit) in the
    first blast identifies in the second blast the query sequence (the original sequence-of
    interest) as the best hit. Using the same rational a paralogue (homolog to a gene in the
    same organism) is found. In case of large sequence families, the ClustalW program may
    be used [Hypertext Transfer Protocol://World Wide Web (dot) ebi (dot) ac (dot)
30  uk/Tools/clustalw2/index (dot) html], followed by a neighbor-joining tree (Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol://en (dot) wikipedia (dot) org/wiki/Neighbor-joining) which helps
    visualizing the clustering.

                In an exemplary embodiment the exogenous polynucleotide does not encode a
      polypeptide having the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ
      ID NOs: 809-852.
                According to     some embodiments       of the   invention,   the exogenous
  5  polynucleotide encodes a polypeptide consisting of the amino acid sequence set forth by
     SEQ ID NO: 68, 51-66, 69-100, 379-656, 707-715, 720-723, 742-754, 764, 766-770 or
     772.
                Nucleic acid sequences encoding the polypeptides of the present invention
     may be optimized for expression. Non-limiting examples of optimized nucleic acid
 10  sequences are provided in SEQ ID NOs:663 (BDL-113), 675 (BDL-129), 676 (BDL
     130), 680 (BDL-134), 683 (BDL-137), 684 (BDL-139) and 685 (BDL-141) which
     encode optimized polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequences set forth by SEQ
     ID NOs:57, 69, 712, 74, 77, 78 and 79. Examples of such sequence modifications
     include, but are not limited to, an altered G/C content to more closely approach that
15   typically found in the plant species of interest, and the removal of codons atypically
    found in the plant species commonly referred to as codon optimization.
               The phrase "codon optimization" refers to the selection of appropriate DNA
    nucleotides for use within a structural gene or fragment thereof that approaches codon
    usage within the plant of interest. Therefore, an optimized gene or nucleic acid
20  sequence refers to a gene in which the nucleotide sequence of a native or naturally
    occurring gene has been modified in order to utilize statistically-preferred or
    statistically-favored codons within the plant.     The nucleotide sequence typically is
    examined at the DNA level and the coding region optimized for expression in the plant
    species determined using any suitable procedure, for example as described in Sardana et
25  al. (1996, Plant Cell Reports 15:677-681). In this method, the standard deviation of
    codon usage, a measure of codon usage bias, may be calculated by first finding the
    squared proportional deviation of usage of each codon of the native gene relative to that
    of highly expressed plant genes, followed by a calculation of the average squared
    deviation. The formula used is: 1 SDCU = n = 1 N [ ( Xn - Yn ) / Yn ] 2 / N, where Xn
30  refers to the frequency of usage of codon n in highly expressed plant genes, where Yn to
    the frequency of usage of codon n in the gene of interest and N refers to the total
    number of codons in the gene of interest.        A Table of codon usage from highly

    WO 2009/141824                                                           PCT/IL2009/000508
                                                   18
     expressed genes of dicotyledonous plants is compiled using the data of Murray et al.
     (1989, Nuc Acids Res. 17:477-498).
                One method of optimizing the nucleic acid sequence in accordance with the
     preferred codon usage for a particular plant cell type is based on the direct use, without
  5  performing any extra statistical calculations, of codon optimization Tables such as those
    provided on-line at the Codon Usage Database through the NIAS (National Institute of
    Agrobiological Sciences) DNA bank in Japan (Hypertext Transfer Protocol://World
    Wide Web (dot) kazusa (dot) or (dot) jp/codon/). The Codon Usage Database contains
    codon usage tables for a number of different species, with each codon usage Table
 10 having been statistically determined based on the data present in Genbank.
                By using the above Tables to determine the most preferred or most favored
    codons for each amino acid in a particular species (for example, rice), a naturally
    occurring nucleotide sequence encoding a protein of interest can be codon optimized for
    that particular plant species. This is effected by replacing codons that may have a low
15  statistical incidence in the particular species genome with corresponding codons, in
    regard to an amino acid, that are statistically more favored. However, one or more less
    favored codons may be selected to delete existing restriction sites, to create new ones at
    potentially useful junctions (5' and 3' ends to add signal peptide or termination cassettes,
    internal sites that might be used to cut and splice segments together to produce a correct
20  full-length sequence), or to eliminate nucleotide sequences that may negatively effect
    mRNA stability or expression.
               The naturally-occurring encoding nucleotide sequence may already, in
    advance of any modification, contain a number of codons that correspond to a
    statistically-favored codon in a particular plant species. Therefore, codon optimization
25  of the native nucleotide sequence may comprise determining which codons, within the
    native nucleotide sequence, are not statistically-favored with regards to a particular
    plant, and modifying these codons in accordance with a codon usage table of the
    particular plant to produce a codon optimized derivative.          A modified nucleotide
    sequence may be fully or partially optimized for plant codon usage provided that the
30  protein encoded by the modified nucleotide sequence is produced at a level higher than
    the protein encoded by the corresponding naturally occurring or native gene.

   effected by introducing to the plant cell a nucleic acid construct which includes the
25 exogenous polynucleotide of some embodiments of the invention and at least one
   promoter for directing transcription of the exogenous polynucleotide in a host cell (a
   plant cell).     Further details of suitable transformation approaches are provided

              As used herein, the term "promoter" refers to a region of DNA which lies
   upstream of the transcriptional initiation site of a gene to which RNA polymerase binds
   to initiate transcription of RNA. The promoter controls where (e.g., which portion of a
   plant) and/or when (e.g., at which stage or condition in the lifetime of an organism) the
 5 gene is expressed.

   (regulatory nucleic acid sequences) which can be used to express a polynucleotide-of
   interest in a plant.
              Thus, according to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention, there is
30 provided a nucleic acid construct comprising a nucleic acid sequence selected from the
   group consisting of SEQ ID NOs:779-792 and a heterologous polynucleotide sequence,

   WO 2009/141824                                                         PCT/IL2009/000508

   wherein the nucleic acid sequence is capable of regulating expression of the
   heterologous polynucleotide in a host cell.
             According to some embodiments           of the invention the heterologous
   polynucleotide is operably linked to the regulatory nucleic acid sequence selected from
 5 the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs:779-792.
             According to some embodiments of the invention, the regulatory nucleic acid
   sequence of the invention range in length from about 500 nucleotides to about 4000
   nucleotides and include one or more sequence regions which are capable of recognizing
   and binding RNA polymerase II and other proteins (trans-acting transcription factors)
10 involved in transcription.
             A coding nucleic acid sequence is "operably linked" to a regulatory sequence
   if the regulatory sequence is capable of exerting a regulatory effect on the coding
   sequence linked thereto.      According to some embodiments of the invention, the
   regulatory sequence is positioned 1-500 bp upstream of the ATG codon of the coding
15 nucleic acid sequence, although it will be appreciated that regulatory sequences can also
   exert their effect when positioned elsewhere with respect to the coding nucleic acid
   sequence (e.g., within an intron).
             As is clearly illustrated in the Examples section which follows, the novel
   regulatory nucleic acid sequences of the invention are capable of regulating expression
20 of a coding nucleic acid sequence (e.g., a reporter gene such as GUS, luciferase)
   operably linked thereto (see Example 6 of the Examples section which follows).
             According to some embodiments of the invention, the regulatory nucleic acid
   sequences of the invention regulate the expression of the heterologous polynucleotide in
   a tissue specific manner.
25           According to some embodiments of the invention, the regulatory nucleic acid
   sequences of the invention regulate the expression of the heterologous polynucleotide in
   a developmental stage - specific manner.
             According to some embodiments of the invention, the regulatory nucleic acid
   sequences of the invention are modified to create variations in the molecule sequences
30 such as to enhance their promoting activities, using methods known in the art, such as

              Accordingly, the regulatory nucleic acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID
   NOs:779-792 may be truncated or deleted and still retain the capacity of directing the
   transcription of an operably linked heterologous DNA sequence. The minimal length of
   a promoter region can be determined by systematically removing sequences from the 5'
 5 and 3'-ends of the isolated polynucleotide by standard techniques known in the art,
   including but not limited to removal of restriction enzyme fragments or digestion with
   nucleases. Consequently, any sequence fragments, portions, or regions of the disclosed
   promoter polynucleotide sequences of the invention can be used as regulatory
   sequences. It will be appreciated that modified sequences (mutated, truncated and the
10 like) can acquire different transcriptional properties such as the direction of different
   pattern of gene expression as compared to the unmodified element.
            Optionally, the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs:779-792 may be modified,
   for example for expression in a range of plant systems. In another approach, novel
   hybrid promoters can be designed or engineered by a number of methods.              Many
15 promoters contain upstream sequences which activate, enhance or define the strength
   and/or specificity of the promoter, such as described, for example, by Atchison [Ann.
   Rev. Cell Biol. 4:127 (1988)]. T-DNA genes, for example contain "TATA" boxes
   defining the site of transcription initiation and other upstream elements located
   upstream of the transcription initiation site modulate transcription levels [Gelvin In:
20 Transgenic Plants (Kung, S.-D. and Us, R., Eds, San Diego: Academic Press, pp.49-87,
   (1988)]. Another chimeric promoter combined a trimer of the octopine synthase (OCS)
   activator to the mannopine synthase (mas) activator plus promoter and reported an
    increase in expression of a reporter gene [Min Ni et al. The Plant Journal 7:661 (1995)].
   The upstream regulatory sequences of the promoter polynucleotide sequences of the
25  invention can be used for the construction of such chimeric or hybrid promoters.
    Methods for construction of variant promoters include, but are not limited to, combining
    control elements of different promoters or duplicating portions or regions of a promoter
    (see for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,110,732 and 5,097,025). Those of skill in the art are
    familiar with the specific conditions and procedures for the construction, manipulation
30  and isolation of macromolecules (e.g., DNA molecules, plasmids, etc.), generation of
    recombinant organisms and the screening and isolation of genes, [see for example

15 that the nucleic acid sequence is not as set forth by SEQ ID NO:756 or 762.
              According to some embodiments of the invention the heterologous
   polynucleotide encodes an amino acid sequence at least about 80 %, at least about 81 %,
   at least about 82 %, at least about 83 %, at least about 84 %, at least about 85 %, at least

   the amino acid sequence is not as set forth by SEQ ID NO: 765 or 771.
25            According to some embodiments the heterologous polynucleotide does not

              According to some embodiments the heterologous polynucleotide does not
   comprise the nucleic acid sequence set forth by SEQ ID NO:807 or 808.
              Thus, according to some embodiments of the invention, the method of
30 increasing oil content, yield, growth rate, biomass, vigor, abiotic stress tolerance and/or

   the nucleic acid sequence is not as set forth by SEQ ID NO:756 or 762, wherein the

              According to some embodiments of the invention, the method of increasing oil
   content, yield, growth rate, biomass, vigor, abiotic stress tolerance and/or nitrogen use
   efficiency of a plant is effected by expressing within the plant a nucleic acid construct

   720-723, 742-754, 764-771 or 772 with the proviso that the amino acid sequence is not
   as set forth by SEQ ID NO: 765 or 771, wherein the nucleic acid sequence is capable of
25 regulating expression of the heterologous polynucleotide in a host cell.
              The nucleic acid construct of some embodiments of the invention can further
   include an appropriate selectable marker and/or an origin of replication. According to
   some embodiments of the invention, the nucleic acid construct utilized is a shuttle
   vector, which can propagate both in E. coli (wherein the construct comprises an
30 appropriate selectable marker and origin of replication) and be compatible with
   propagation in cells.    The construct according to the present invention can be, for

    chromosome.
               The nucleic acid construct of some embodiments of the invention can be
    utilized to stably or transiently transform plant cells.    In stable transformation, the
 5  exogenous polynucleotide is integrated into the plant genome and as such it represents a
    stable and inherited trait. In transient transformation, the exogenous polynucleotide is
    expressed by the cell transformed but it is not integrated into the genome and as such it
    represents a transient trait.
              There are various methods of introducing            foreign genes into both
10 monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants (Potrykus, I. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol.,

              The principle methods of causing stable integration of exogenous DNA into

              The Agrobacterium system includes the use of plasmid vectors that contain
 5 defined DNA segments that integrate into the plant genomic DNA.                Methods of
   inoculation of the plant tissue vary depending upon the plant species and the
   Agrobacterium delivery system. A widely used approach is the leaf disc procedure
   which can be performed with any tissue explant that provides a good source for
   initiation of whole plant differentiation.     See, e.g., Horsch et al. in Plant Molecular
10 Biology Manual A5, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht (1988) p. 1-9.                    A
   supplementary approach employs the Agrobacterium delivery system in combination
   with vacuum infiltration. The Agrobacterium system is especially viable in the creation
   of transgenic dicotyledonous plants.
              There are various methods of direct DNA transfer into plant cells.             In
15 electroporation, the protoplasts are briefly exposed to a strong electric field.          In
   microinjection, the DNA is mechanically injected directly into the cells using very small
   micropipettes. In microparticle bombardment, the DNA is adsorbed on microprojectiles
   such as magnesium sulfate crystals or tungsten particles, and the microprojectiles are
   physically accelerated into cells or plant tissues.
20            Following stable transformation plant propagation is exercised.       The most
   common method of plant propagation is by seed. Regeneration by seed propagation,
   however, has the deficiency that due to heterozygosity there is a lack of uniformity in
   the crop, since seeds are produced by plants according to the genetic variances governed
   by Mendelian rules. Basically, each seed is genetically different and each will grow
25 with its own specific traits. Therefore, it is preferred that the transformed plant be
   produced such that the regenerated plant has the identical traits and characteristics of the
   parent transgenic plant.     Therefore, it is preferred that the transformed plant be
   regenerated by micropropagation which provides a rapid, consistent reproduction of the
   transformed plants.
30            Micropropagation is a process of growing new generation plants from a single
   piece of tissue that has been excised from a selected parent plant or cultivar. This
   process permits the mass reproduction of plants having the preferred tissue expressing

   WO 2009/141824                                                           PCT/IL2009/000508
                                                 31
   the fusion protein. The new generation plants which are produced are genetically
   identical to, and have all of the characteristics of, the original plant. Micropropagation
   allows mass production of quality plant material in a short period of time and offers a
   rapid multiplication of selected cultivars in the preservation of the characteristics of the
 5 original transgenic or transformed plant. The advantages of cloning plants are the speed
   of plant multiplication and the quality and uniformity of plants produced.
             Micropropagation is a multi-stage procedure that requires alteration of culture
   medium or growth conditions between stages.           Thus, the micropropagation process
   involves four basic stages: Stage one, initial tissue culturing; stage two, tissue culture
10 multiplication; stage three, differentiation and plant formation; and stage four,
   greenhouse culturing and hardening. During stage one, initial tissue culturing, the tissue
   culture is established and certified contaminant-free. During stage two, the initial tissue
   culture is multiplied until a sufficient number of tissue samples are produced to meet
   production goals. During stage three, the tissue samples grown in stage two are divided
15 and grown into individual plantlets.       At stage four, the transformed plantlets are
   transferred to a greenhouse for hardening where the plants' tolerance to light is
   gradually increased so that it can be grown in the natural environment.
             According to some embodiments of the invention, the transgenic plants are
   generated by transient transformation of leaf cells, meristematic cells or the whole plant.
20           Transient transformation can be effected by any of the direct DNA transfer
   methods described above or by viral infection using modified plant viruses.
             Viruses that have been shown to be useful for the transformation of plant hosts
   include CaMV, Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), brome mosaic virus (BMV) and Bean
   Common Mosaic Virus (BV or BCMV). Transformation of plants using plant viruses is
25 described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,855,237 (bean golden mosaic virus; BGV), EP-A 67,553
   (TMV), Japanese Published Application No. 63-14693 (TMV), EPA 194,809 (BV),
   EPA 278,667 (BV); and Gluzman, Y. et al., Communications in Molecular Biology:
   Viral Vectors, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, pp.                172-189 (1988).
   Pseudovirus particles for use in expressing foreign DNA in many hosts, including plants
30 are described in WO 87/06261.
             According to some embodiments of the invention, the virus used for transient
   transformations is avirulent and thus is incapable of causing severe symptoms such as

   WO 2009/141824                                                           PCT/IL2009/000508

   reduced growth rate, mosaic, ring spots, leaf roll, yellowing, streaking, pox formation,
   tumor formation and pitting. A suitable avirulent virus may be a naturally occurring
   avirulent virus or an artificially attenuated virus. Virus attenuation may be effected by
   using methods well known in the art including, but not limited to, sub-lethal heating,
 5 chemical treatment or by directed mutagenesis techniques such as described, for
   example, by Kurihara and Watanabe (Molecular Plant Pathology 4:259-269, 2003), Gal
   on et al. (1992), Atreya et al. (1992) and Huet et al. (1994).
              Suitable virus strains can be obtained from available sources such as, for
   example, the American Type culture Collection (ATCC) or by isolation from infected
10 plants. Isolation of viruses from infected plant tissues can be effected by techniques
   well known in the art such as described, for example by Foster and Tatlor, Eds. "Plant
   Virology Protocols: From Virus Isolation to Transgenic Resistance (Methods in
   Molecular Biology (Humana Pr), Vol 81)", Humana Press, 1998. Briefly, tissues of an
   infected plant believed to contain a high concentration of a suitable virus, preferably
15 young leaves and flower petals, are ground in a buffer solution (e.g., phosphate buffer
   solution) to produce a virus infected sap which can be used in subsequent inoculations.
              Construction of plant RNA viruses for the introduction and expression of non
   viral exogenous polynucleotide sequences in plants is demonstrated by the above
   references as well as by Dawson, W. 0. et al., Virology (1989) 172:285-292; Takamatsu
20 et al. EMBO J. (1987) 6:307-311; French et al.             Science (1986) 231:1294-1297;

              When the virus is a DNA virus, suitable modifications can be made to the
   virus itself. Alternatively, the virus can first be cloned into a bacterial plasmid for ease
   of constructing the desired viral vector with the foreign DNA. The virus can then be
25 excised from the plasmid. If the virus is a DNA virus, a bacterial origin of replication
   can be attached to the viral DNA, which is then replicated by the bacteria.
   Transcription and translation of this DNA will produce the coat protein which will
   encapsidate the viral DNA. If the virus is an RNA virus, the virus is generally cloned as
   a cDNA and inserted into a plasmid.         The plasmid is then used to make all of the
30 constructions. The RNA virus is then produced by transcribing the viral sequence of the
   plasmid and translation of the viral genes to produce the coat protein(s) which
    encapsidate the viral RNA.

              In one embodiment, a plant viral polynucleotide is provided in which the
    native coat protein coding sequence has been deleted from a viral polynucleotide, a non
    native plant viral coat protein coding sequence and a non-native promoter, preferably
    the subgenomic promoter of the non-native coat protein coding sequence, capable of
 5  expression in the plant host, packaging of the recombinant plant viral polynucleotide,
   and ensuring a systemic infection of the host by the recombinant plant viral
   polynucleotide, has been inserted.      Alternatively, the coat protein gene may be
   inactivated by insertion of the non-native polynucleotide sequence within it, such that a
   protein is produced. The recombinant plant viral polynucleotide may contain one or
10 more additional non-native subgenomic promoters.           Each non-native subgenomic
   promoter is capable of transcribing or expressing adjacent genes or polynucleotide
   sequences in the plant host and incapable of recombination with each other and with
   native subgenomic promoters. Non-native (foreign) polynucleotide sequences may be
   inserted adjacent the native plant viral subgenomic promoter or the native and a non
15 native plant viral subgenomic promoters if more than one polynucleotide sequence is
   included. The non-native polynucleotide sequences are transcribed or expressed in the
   host plant under control of the subgenomic promoter to produce the desired products.
             In a second embodiment, a recombinant plant viral polynucleotide is provided
   as in the first embodiment except that the native coat protein coding sequence is placed
20 adjacent one of the non-native coat protein subgenomic promoters instead of a non
   native coat protein coding sequence.
             In a third embodiment, a recombinant plant viral polynucleotide is provided in
   which the native coat protein gene is adjacent its subgenomic promoter and one or more
   non-native subgenomic promoters have been inserted into the viral polynucleotide. The
25 inserted non-native subgenomic promoters are capable of transcribing or expressing
   adjacent genes in a plant host and are incapable of recombination with each other and
   with native subgenomic promoters.        Non-native polynucleotide sequences may be
   inserted adjacent the non-native subgenomic plant viral promoters such that the
   sequences are transcribed or expressed in the host plant under control of the subgenomic
30 promoters to produce the desired product.

   replaced by a non-native coat protein coding sequence.
             The viral vectors are encapsidated by the coat proteins encoded by the
 5 recombinant plant viral polynucleotide to produce a recombinant plant virus.           The
   recombinant plant viral polynucleotide or recombinant plant virus is used to infect
   appropriate host plants.      The recombinant plant viral polynucleotide is capable of
   replication in the host, systemic spread in the host, and transcription or expression of
   foreign gene(s) (exogenous polynucleotide) in the host to produce the desired protein.

             In addition to the above, the polynucleotide of the present invention can also
   be introduced into a chloroplast genome thereby enabling chloroplast expression.
20           A technique for introducing exogenous polynucleotide sequences to the
   genome of the chloroplasts is known.             This technique involves the following
   procedures. First, plant cells are chemically treated so as to reduce the number of
   chloroplasts per cell to about one. Then, the exogenous polynucleotide is introduced via
   particle bombardment into the cells with the aim of introducing at least one exogenous
25 polynucleotide molecule into the chloroplasts. The exogenous polynucleotides selected
   such that it is integratable into the chloroplast's genome via homologous recombination
   which is readily effected by enzymes inherent to the chloroplast.        To this end, the
   exogenous polynucleotide includes, in addition to a gene of interest, at least one
   polynucleotide stretch which is derived from the chloroplast's genome. In addition, the
30 exogenous polynucleotide includes a selectable marker, which serves by sequential
   selection procedures to ascertain that all or substantially all of the copies of the
   chloroplast    genomes     following    such   selection  will  include   the  exogenous

                                                 35
   polynucleotide. Further details relating to this technique are found in U.S. Pat. Nos.
   4,945,050; and 5,693,507 which are incorporated herein by reference. A polypeptide
   can thus be produced by the protein expression system of the chloroplast and become
   integrated into the chloroplast's inner membrane.
 5           Since processes which increase oil content, yield, growth rate, biomass, vigor,
   abiotic stress tolerance and/or nitrogen use efficiency of a plant can involve multiple
   genes acting additively or in synergy (see, for example, in Quesda et al., Plant Physiol.
   130:951-063, 2002), the present invention also envisages expressing a plurality of
   exogenous polynucleotides in a single host plant to thereby achieve superior effect on
10 oil content, yield, growth rate, biomass, vigor, abiotic stress tolerance and/or nitrogen
   use efficiency.
             Expressing a plurality of exogenous polynucleotides in a single host plant can
   be effected by co-introducing multiple nucleic acid constructs, each including a
   different exogenous polynucleotide, into a single plant cell. The transformed cell can
15 than be regenerated into a mature plant using the methods described hereinabove.
             Alternatively, expressing a plurality of exogenous polynucleotides in a single
   host plant can be effected by co-introducing into a single plant-cell a single nucleic-acid
   construct including a plurality of different exogenous polynucleotides. Such a construct
   can be designed with a single promoter sequence which can transcribe a polycistronic
20 messenger RNA including all the different exogenous polynucleotide sequences. To
   enable co-translation of the different polypeptides encoded by the polycistronic
   messenger RNA, the polynucleotide sequences can be inter-linked via an internal
   ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence which facilitates translation of polynucleotide
   sequences positioned downstream of the IRES sequence. In this case, a transcribed
25 polycistronic RNA molecule encoding the different polypeptides described above will
   be translated from both the capped 5' end and the two internal IRES sequences of the
   polycistronic RNA molecule to thereby produce in the cell all different polypeptides.
   Alternatively, the construct can include several promoter sequences each linked to a
   different exogenous polynucleotide sequence.
30           The plant cell transformed with the construct including a plurality of different
   exogenous polynucleotides, can be regenerated into a mature plant, using the methods
   described hereinabove.

   WO 2009/141824                                                           PCT/IL2009/000508

              Alternatively, expressing a plurality of exogenous polynucleotides in a single
   host plant can be effected by introducing different nucleic acid constructs, including
   different exogenous polynucleotides, into a plurality of plants.           The regenerated
   transformed plants can then be cross-bred and resultant progeny selected for superior
 5 abiotic stress tolerance, growth, biomass, yield, vigor and/or nitrogen use efficiency
   traits, using conventional plant breeding techniques.
              As mentioned above, and further described in Example 9 of the Examples
   section which follows, the present inventors have uncovered that downregulating the
   expression level of the BDL127 gene product (e.g., the polynucleotides set forth by
10 SEQ ID NO:17 or 673; or the polypeptide set forth by SEQ ID NO:67) and/or of
   homologous thereof can be used to increase yield (e.g., seed yield), oil content, biomass,
   growth rate, vigor, ABST and/or NUE in a plant.
              In some cases, overexpression of the exogenous polynucleotide within the
   plant can result in silencing of the endogenous polynucleotide (which is homologous of
15 the exogenous polynucleotide), probably through RNA interference or co-suppression
   mechanisms.      To test the effect of downregulation of the polynucleotide(s) of the
   invention on the desired plant trait (e.g., plant yield, oil content, biomass, vigor, ABST
   or NUE), various downregulation methods and agents can be used.
              Downregulation (gene silencing) of the transcription or translation product of
20 an endogenous gene such as BDL127 can be achieved by methods which are well
   known in the art e.g., co-suppression, antisense suppression, RNA interference and
   ribozyme polynucleotide molecules, changing the promoter structure, removal or
   creation transcription factor binding sites or expression under different promoters.
   Guidelines for effecting same are provided infra.
25            Co-suppression (sense suppression) - Inhibition of the endogenous gene can
   be achieved by co-suppression, using an RNA molecule (or an expression vector
   encoding same) which is in the sense orientation with respect to the transcription
   direction of the endogenous gene. The polynucleotide used for co-suppression may
   correspond to all or part of the sequence encoding the endogenous polypeptide and/or to
30 all or part of the 5' and/or 3' untranslated region of the endogenous transcript; it may
   also be an unpolyadenylated RNA; an RNA which lacks a 5' cap structure; or an RNA
   which contains an unsplicable intron. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide used

    WO 2009/141824                                                         PCT/IL2009/000508
                                                 37
    for co-suppression is designed to eliminate the start codon of the endogenous
    polynucleotide so that no protein product will be translated. However, as with antisense
    suppression, the suppressive efficiency is enhanced as specificity of hybridization is
    increased, e.g., as the introduced sequence is lengthened, and/or as the sequence
 5  similarity between the introduced sequence and the endogenous gene is increased. For
    further details see U.S. Pat. Apple. Nos. 20050172364 and No. 5,231,020 which are fully
    incorporated herein by reference.
              According     to  some embodiments       of the invention,      the exogenous
   polynucleotide comprises an untranslatable nucleic acid sequence, e.g., a sequence
10 comprising one or more pre-mature stop codons, or nonsense mutations, such as
   described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,583,021.
              According to some embodiments of the invention, downregulation of the
   endogenous gene is performed using an amplicon expression vector which comprises a
   plant virus-derived sequence that contains all or part of the target gene but generally not
15 all of the genes of the native virus. The viral sequences present in the transcription
   product of the expression vector allow the transcription product to direct its own
   replication. The transcripts produced by the amplicon may be either sense or antisense
   relative to the target sequence [see for example, Angell and Baulcombe, (1997) EMBO
   J. 16:3675-3684; Angell and Baulcombe, (1999) PlantJ. 20:357-362, and U.S. Pat. No.
20 6,646,805, each of which is herein incorporated by reference].
              According    to   some embodiments       of the invention,- the exogenous
   polynucleotide comprises an untranslatable nucleic acid sequence, e.g., a sequence
   comprising one or more pre-mature stop codons, or nonsense mutations, such as
   described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,583,021.
25            Antisense suppression - Antisense suppression can be performed using an
   antisense polynucleotide or an expression vector which is designed to express an RNA
   molecule complementary to all or part of the messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the
   endogenous polypeptide and/or to all or part of the 5' and/or 3' untranslated region of
   the endogenous gene. Over expression of the antisense RNA molecule can result in
30 reduced expression of the native (endogenous) gene. The antisense polynucleotide may
   be fully complementary to the target sequence (i.e., 100 % identical to the complement
   of the target sequence) or partially complementary to the target sequence (i.e., less than

   WO 2009/141824                                                           PCT/IL2009/000508
                                                 38
    100 % identical, e.g., less than 90 %, less than 80 % identical to the complement of the
    target sequence).    Antisense suppression may be used to inhibit the expression of
   multiple proteins in the same plant (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,657).        In addition,
   portions of the antisense nucleotides may be used to disrupt the expression of the target
 5 gene. Generally, sequences of at least about 50 nucleotides, at least about 100
   nucleotides, at least about 200 nucleotides, at least about 300, at least about 400, at least
   about 450, at least about 500, at least about 550, or greater may be used. Methods of
   using antisense suppression to inhibit the expression of endogenous genes in plants are
   described, for example, in Liu, et al., (2002) Plant Physiol. 129:1732-1743 and U.S. Pat.
10 Nos. 5,759,829 and 5,942,657, each of which is herein incorporated by reference.
   Efficiency of antisense suppression may be increased by including a poly-dT region in
   the expression cassette at a position 3' to the antisense sequence and 5' of the
   polyadenylation signal [See, U.S. Patent Publication No. 20020048814, herein
   incorporated by reference].
15           RNA interference - RNA interference can be achieved using a polynucleotide,
   which can anneal to itself and form a double stranded RNA having a stem-loop structure
   (also called hairpin structure), or using two polynucleotides, which form a double
   stranded RNA.
             For hairpin RNA (hpRNA) interference, the expression vector is designed to
20 express an RNA molecule that hybridizes to itself to form a hairpin structure that
   comprises a single-stranded loop region and a base-paired stem.
             In some embodiments of the invention, the base-paired stem region of the
   hpRNA molecule determines the specificity of the RNA interference.                  In this
   configuration, the sense sequence of the base-paired stem region may correspond to all
25 or part of the endogenous mRNA to be downregulated, or to a portion of a promoter
   sequence controlling expression of the endogenous gene to be inhibited; and the
   antisense sequence of the base-paired stem region is fully or partially complementary to
   the sense sequence.      Such hpRNA molecules are highly efficient at inhibiting the
   expression of endogenous genes, in a manner which is inherited by subsequent
30 generations of plants [See, e.g., Chuang and Meyerowitz, (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
   USA 97:4985-4990; Stoutjesdijk, et al., (2002) Plant Physiol. 129:1723-1731; and
   Waterhouse and Helliwell, (2003) Nat. Rev. Genet. 4:29-38; Chuang and Meyerowitz,

             According to some embodiments of the invention, the sense sequence of the
 5 base-paired stem is from about 10 nucleotides to about 2,500 nucleotides in length, e.g.,
   from about 10 nucleotides to about 500 nucleotides, e.g., from about 15 nucleotides to
   about 300 nucleotides, e.g., from about 20 nucleotides to about 100 nucleotides, e.g., or
   from about 25 nucleotides to about 100 nucleotides.
             According to some embodiments of the invention, the antisense sequence of
10 the base-paired stem may have a length that is shorter, the same as, or longer than the
   length of the corresponding sense sequence.
             According to some embodiments of the invention, the loop portion of the
   hpRNA can be from about 10 nucleotides to about 500 nucleotides in length, for
   example from about 15 nucleotides to about 100 nucleotides, from about 20 nucleotides
15 to about 300 nucleotides or from about 25 nucleotides to about 400 nucleotides in
   length.
             According to some embodiments of the invention, the loop portion of the
   hpRNA can include an intron (ihpRNA), which is capable of being spliced in the host
   cell. The use of an intron minimizes the size of the loop in the hairpin RNA molecule
20 following splicing and thus increases efficiency of the interference [See, for example,

             In some embodiments of the invention, the .loop region of the hairpin RNA
   determines the specificity of the RNA interference to its target endogenous RNA. In
30 this configuration, the loop sequence corresponds to all or part of the endogenous
   messenger RNA of the target gene. See, for example, WO 02/00904; Mette, et al.,

             For double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) interference, the sense and antisense RNA
 5 molecules can be expressed in the same cell from a single expression vector (which
   comprises sequences of both strands) or from two expression vectors (each comprising
   the sequence of one of the strands). Methods for using dsRNA interference to inhibit
   the expression of endogenous plant genes are described in Waterhouse, et al., (1998)
   Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:13959-13964; and WO 99/49029, WO 99/53050, WO
10 99/61631, and WO 00/49035; each of which is herein incorporated by reference.
             According to some embodiments of the invention, RNA interference is
   effected using an expression vector designed to express an RNA molecule that is
   modeled on an endogenous micro RNAs (miRNA) gene. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are
   regulatory agents consisting of about 22 ribonucleotides and highly efficient at
15 inhibiting the expression of endogenous genes [Javier, et al., (2003) Nature 425:257
   263]. The miRNA gene encodes an RNA that forms a hairpin structure containing a 22
   nucleotide sequence that is complementary to the endogenous target gene.
             Ribozyme - Catalytic RNA molecules, ribozymes, are designed to cleave
   particular mRNA transcripts, thus preventing expression of their encoded polypeptides.
20 Ribozymes cleave mRNA at site-specific recognition sequences.            For example,
   "hammerhead ribozymes" (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,678) cleave mRNAs at
   locations dictated by flanking regions that form complementary base pairs with the
   target mRNA. The sole requirement is that the target RNA contains a 5'-UG-3'
   nucleotide sequence. Hammerhead ribozyme sequences can be embedded in a stable
25 RNA such as a transfer RNA (tRNA) to increase cleavage efficiency in vivo [Perriman
   et al. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 92(13):6175-6179; de Feyter and Gaudron
   Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 74, Chapter 43, "Expressing Ribozymes in Plants",
   Edited by Turner, P. C, Humana Press Inc., Totowa, N.J.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,423,885].
   RNA endoribonucleases such as that found in Tetrahymena thermophila are also useful
30 ribozymes (U.S. Pat. No. 4,987,071).
             Plant lines transformed with any of the downregulating molecules described
   hereinabove are screened to identify those that show the greatest inhibition of the

   WO 2009/141824                                                           PCT/IL2009/000508

   endogenous polynucleotide or polypeptide-of-interest, and thereby the increase of the
   desired plant trait (e.g., yield, oil content, growth rate, biomass, vigor, NUE and/or
   ABST).
              Thus,    the invention    encompasses plants exogenously          expressing    the
 5 polynucleotide(s), the nucleic acid constructs and/or polypeptide(s) of the invention.
   Once expressed within the plant cell or the entire plant, the level of the polypeptide
   encoded by the exogenous polynucleotide can be determined by methods well known in
   the art such as, activity assays, Western blots using antibodies capable of specifically
   binding the polypeptide, Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA), radio
10 immuno-assays            (RIA),       immunohistochemistry,          immunocytochemistry,
   immunofluorescence and the like.
              The level of an RNA molecule-of interest in the plant [e.g., the RNA
   transcribed from the exogenous polynucleotide of the invention or the endogenous RNA
   which is targeted by the downregulating molecule of the invention] can be determined
15 using methods        well known in the art such as        Northern blot analysis, reverse
   transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis (including quantitative,
   semi-quantitative or real-time RT-PCR) and RNA-in situ hybridization.
              The endogenous homolog of the exogenous polynucleotide or polypeptide of
   the invention, or a fragment of the endogenous homolog (e.g. introns or untranslated
20 regions) in the plant can be used as a marker for marker assisted selection (MAS), in
   which a marker is used for indirect selection of a genetic determinant or determinants of
   a trait of interest (e.g., biomass, growth rate, oil content, yield, abiotic stress tolerance
   and/or nitrogen use efficiency). These genes (DNA or RNA sequence) may contain or
   be linked to polymorphic sites or genetic markers on the genome such as restriction
25 fragment length polymorphism           (RFLP), microsatellites      and single     nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP),          DNA    fingerprinting   (DFP), amplified      fragment    length
   polymorphism (AFLP), expression level polymorphism, polymorphism of the encoded
   polypeptide and any other polymorphism at the DNA or RNA sequence.
              Examples of marker assisted selections include, but are not limited to,
30 selection for a morphological trait (e.g., a gene that affects form, coloration, male
   sterility or resistance such as the presence or absence of awn, leaf sheath coloration,
   height, grain color, aroma of rice); selection for a biochemical trait (e.g., a gene that

   WO 2009/141824                                                             PCT/IL2009/000508

   encodes a protein that can be extracted and observed; for example, isozymes and storage
   proteins); selection for a biological trait (e.g., pathogen races or insect biotypes based on
   host pathogen or host parasite interaction can be used as a marker since the genetic
   constitution of an organism can affect its susceptibility to pathogens or parasites).
 5            The polynucleotides and polypeptides described hereinabove can be used in a
   wide range of economical plants, in a safe and cost effective manner.
              Plant lines exogenously expressing the polynucleotide or the polypeptide of
   the invention are screened to identify those that show the greatest increase of the desired
   plant trait.
10            The effect of the transgene (the exogenous polynucleotide encoding the
   polypeptide of the invention) or the downregulating molecule (e.g., RNA-interference
   molecule) on abiotic stress tolerance can be determined using known methods.
              Abiotic stress tolerance - Transformed (i.e., expressing the transgene) and
   non-transformed (wild type) plants are exposed to an abiotic stress condition, such as
15 water deprivation, suboptimal temperature (low temperature, high temperature), nutrient
   deficiency, nutrient excess, a salt stress condition, osmotic stress, heavy metal toxicity,
   anaerobiosis, atmospheric pollution and UV irradiation.
              Salinity tolerance assay - Transgenic plants with tolerance to high salt
   concentrations are expected to exhibit better germination, seedling vigor or growth in
20 high salt. Salt stress can be effected in many ways such as, for example, by irrigating
   the plants with a hyperosmotic solution, by cultivating the plants hydroponically in a
   hyperosmotic growth solution (e.g., Hoagland solution), or by culturing the plants in a
   hyperosmotic growth medium [e.g., 50 % Murashige-Skoog medium (MS medium)].
   Since different plants vary considerably in their tolerance to salinity, the salt
25 concentration in the irrigation water, growth solution, or growth medium can be
   adjusted according to the specific characteristics of the specific plant cultivar or variety,
   so as to inflict a mild or moderate effect on the physiology and/or morphology of the
   plants (for guidelines as to appropriate concentration see, Bernstein and Kafkafi, Root
   Growth Under Salinity Stress In: Plant Roots, The Hidden Half 3rd ed. Waisel Y, Eshel
30 A and Kafkafi U. (editors) Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, 2002, and reference therein).
              For example, a salinity tolerance test can be performed by irrigating plants at
   different developmental stages with increasing concentrations of sodium chloride (for

    WO 2009/141824                                                         PCT/IL2009/000508

    example 50 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM, 400 mM NaCl) applied from the bottom and from
    above to ensure even dispersal of salt. Following exposure to the stress condition the
    plants are frequently monitored until substantial physiological and/or morphological
    effects appear in wild type plants. Thus, the external phenotypic appearance, degree of
 5  wilting and overall success to reach maturity and yield progeny are compared between
    control and transgenic plants. Quantitative parameters of tolerance measured include,
   but are not limited to, the average wet and dry weight, the weight of the seeds yielded,
    the average seed size and the number of seeds produced per plant. Transformed plants
   not exhibiting substantial physiological and/or morphological effects, or exhibiting
10 higher biomass than wild-type plants, are identified as abiotic stress tolerant plants.
              Osmotic tolerance test - Osmotic stress assays (including sodium chloride and
   mannitol assays) are conducted to determine if an osmotic stress phenotype was sodium
   chloride-specific or if it was a general osmotic stress related phenotype. Plants which
   are tolerant to osmotic stress may have more tolerance to drought and/or freezing. For
15 salt and osmotic stress germination experiments, the medium is supplemented for
   example with 50 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM NaCl or 100 mM, 200 mM NaCl, 400 mM
   mannitol.
             Drought tolerance assay/Osmoticum assay - Tolerance to drought is
   performed to identify the genes conferring better plant survival after acute water
20 deprivation. To analyze whether the transgenic plants are more tolerant to drought, an
   osmotic stress produced by the presence of sorbitol or polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000)
   in the medium is performed. Control and transgenic plants are germinated and grown in
   plant-agar plates for 10 days, after which they are transferred to plates containing 1.5%
   PEG8000 or 500 mM of sorbitol. Plants are grown for about additional 10 days. The
25 treatment causes growth retardation, then both control and transgenic plants are
   compared, by measuring plant weight (fresh and dry), yield, and by growth rates.
             Conversely,    soil-based   drought   screens   are   performed     with    plants
   overexpressing the polynucleotides detailed above. Seeds from control Arabidopsis
   plants, or other transgenic plants overexpressing the polypeptide of the invention are
30 germinated and transferred to pots. Drought stress is obtained after irrigation is ceased
   accompanied by placing the pots on absorbent paper to enhance the soil-drying rate.
   Transgenic and control plants are compared to each other when the majority of the

   WO 2009/141824                                                           PCT/IL2009/000508
                                                44
   control plants develop severe wilting. Plants are re-watered after obtaining a significant
   fraction of the control plants displaying a severe wilting. Plants are ranked comparing to
   controls for each of two criteria: tolerance to the drought conditions and recovery
   (survival) following re-watering.
 5            Cold stress tolerance - To analyze cold stress, mature (25 day old) plants are
   transferred to 4 *C chambers for 1 or 2 weeks, with constitutive light. Later on plants
   are moved back to greenhouse.          Two weeks later damages from chilling period,
   resulting in growth retardation and other phenotypes, are compared between both
   control and transgenic plants, by measuring plant weight (wet and dry), and by
10 comparing growth rates measured as time to flowering, plant size, yield, and the like.
              Heat stress tolerance - Heat stress tolerance is achieved by exposing the
   plants to temperatures above 34 *C for a certain period. Plant tolerance is examined
   after transferring the plants back to 22 *C for recovery and evaluation after 5 days
   relative to internal controls (non-transgenic plants) or plants not exposed to neither cold
15 or heat stress.
              Germination tests - Germination tests compare the percentage of seeds from
   transgenic plants that could complete the germination process to the percentage of seeds
   from control plants that are treated in the same manner. Normal conditions are
   considered for example, incubations at 22 *C under 22-hour light 2-hour dark daily
20 cycles. Evaluation of germination and seedling vigor is conducted between 4 and 14
   days after planting. The basal media is 50 % MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962
   Plant Physiology 15, 473-497).
              Germination is checked also at unfavorable           conditions such as cold
   (incubating at temperatures lower than 10 *C instead of 22 *C) or using seed inhibition
25 solutions that contain high concentrations of an osmolyte such as sorbitol (at
   concentrations of 50 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM, 500 mM, and up to 1000 mM)
   or applying increasing concentrations of salt (of 50 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM,
   500 mM NaCl).
              The effect of the transgene (the exogenous polynucleotide encoding the
30 polypeptide of the invention) or the downregulating molecule (e.g.,, RNA-interference
   molecule) on nitrogen use efficiency can be determined using known methods.

              Nitrogen use efficiency assay using plantlets -Briefly, transgenic plants which
    are grown for 7-10 days in 0.5 x MS [Murashige-Skoog] supplemented with a selection
    agent are transferred to two nitrogen fertilization conditions: MS media in which the
    combined nitrogen concentration (NH 4 NO 3 and KNO 3 ) was 0.75 mM (nitrogen
 5  deficiency). Usually, 20 randomly selected plants from each event of a gene are
    transferred to the media. Plants are allowed to grow for additional 10 days. At the end
    of the 10 days plants are removed from the plate and immediately weighed (fresh
    weight) and then dried for 24 and re-weight (dry weight for later statistical analysis).
    Transgenic plants are compared to control plants grown in parallel under the same
10  conditions. Mock- transgenic plants used as control can be those transgenic plants
    expressing the uidA reporter gene (GUS) under the same promoter or transgenic plants
    harboring only the same promoter but lacking any reporter gene.
              Grain protein concentration - Grain protein content (g grain protein m-2 ) is
    estimated as the product of the mass of grain N (g grain N m-2 ) multiplied by the
15 N/protein conversion ratio of k-5.13 (Mosse 1990, supra).              The grain protein
   concentration is estimated as the ratio of grain protein content per unit mass of the grain
    (g grain protein kg-1 grain).
              The effect of the transgene (the exogenous polynucleotide encoding the
   polypeptide of the invention) or the downregulating molecule (e.g., RNA-interference
20 molecule) on plant's vigor, growth rate, biomass, yield and/or oil content can be
   determined using known methods.
              Plant vigor - The plant vigor can be calculated by the increase in growth
   parameters such as leaf area, fiber length, rosette diameter, plant fresh weight and the
   like per time.
25            Growth rate - The growth rate can be measured using digital analysis of
   growing plants. For example, images of plants growing in greenhouse on plot basis can
   be captured every 3 days and the rosette area can be calculated by digital analysis.
   Rosette area growth is calculated using the difference of rosette area between days of
   sampling divided by the difference in days between samples.
30            Evaluation of growth rate can be done by measuring plant biomass produced,
   rosette area, leaf size or root length per time (can be measured in cm 2 per day of leaf
   area).

    WO 2009/141824                                                          PCT/IL2009/000508

             Relative growth area can be calculated using Formula I.
             Formula I:
             Relative growth area rate = (A Area / At) * (1/ Area  to)
             At is the current analyzed image day subtracted from the initial day (t-tO).
 5           Thus, the relative growth area rate is in units of 1/day and length growth rate is
   in units of 1/day.
             Seed yield - Evaluation of the seed yield per plant can be done by measuring
   the amount (weight or size) or quantity (i.e., number) of dry seeds produced and
   harvested from 8-16 plants and divided by the number of plants.
10           For example, the total seeds from 8-16 plants can be collected, weighted using
   e.g., an analytical balance and the total weight can be divided by the number of plants.
   Seed yield per growing area can be calculated in the same manner while taking into
   account the growing area given to a single plant. Increase seed yield per growing area
   could be achieved by increasing seed yield per plant, and/or by increasing number of
15 plants capable of growing in a given area.
             In addition, seed yield can be determined via the weight of 1000 seeds. The
   weight of 1000 seeds can be determined as follows: seeds are scattered on a glass tray
   and a picture is taken. Each sample is weighted and then using the digital analysis, the
   number of seeds in each sample is calculated.
20           The 1000 seeds weight can be calculated using formula II:
             Formula II:
             1000 Seed Weight = number of seed in sample/ sample weight X 1000
             The Harvest Index can be calculated using Formula III
             Formula III:
25           Harvest Index = Average seed yield per plant/ Average dry weight
             Fiber length - Fiber length can be measured using fibrograph. The fibrograph
   system was used to compute length in terms of "Upper Half Mean" length. The upper
   half mean (UHM) is the average length of longer half of the fiber distribution. The
   fibrograph measures length in span lengths at a given percentage point (Hypertext

              Oil content - The oil content of a plant can be determined by extraction of the
    oil from the seed or the vegetative portion of the plant. Briefly, lipids (oil) can be
   removed from the plant (e.g., seed) by grinding the plant tissue in the presence of
   specific solvents (e.g., hexane or petroleum ether) and extracting the oil in a continuous
 5 extractor. Indirect oil content analysis can be carried out using various known methods
   such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy, which measures the
   resonance energy absorbed by hydrogen atoms in the liquid state of the sample [See for
   example, Conway TF. and Earle FR., 1963, Journal of the American Oil Chemists'
   Society; Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, ISSN: 0003-021X (Print) 1558-9331 (Online)];
10 the Near Infrared (NI) Spectroscopy, which utilizes the absorption of near infrared
   energy (1100-2500 inm) by the sample; and a method described in WO/2001/023884,
   which is based on extracting oil a solvent, evaporating the solvent in a gas stream which
   forms oil particles, and directing a light into the gas stream and oil particles which forms
   a detectable reflected light.
15            Thus, the present invention is of high agricultural value for promoting the
   yield of commercially desired crops (e.g., biomass of vegetative organ such as poplar
   wood, or reproductive organ such as number of seeds or seed biomass).
              Any of the transgenic plants described hereinabove or parts thereof may be
   processed to produce a feed, meal, protein or oil preparation, such as for ruminant
20 animals.
              The transgenic plants described hereinabove, which exhibit increased oil
   content can be used to produce plant oil (by extracting the oil from the plant).
              The plant oil (including the seed oil and/or the vegetative portion oil) produced
   according to the method of the invention may be combined with a variety of other
25 ingredients. The specific ingredients included in a product are determined according to
   the intended use. Exemplary products include animal feed, raw material for chemical
   modification, biodegradable plastic, blended food product, edible oil, biofuel, cooking
   oil, lubricant, biodiesel, snack food, cosmetics, and fermentation process raw material.
   Exemplary products to be incorporated to the plant oil include animal feeds, human
30 food products such as extruded snack foods, breads, as a food binding agent,
   aquaculture feeds, fermentable mixtures, food supplements, sport drinks, nutritional
   food bars, multi-vitamin supplements, diet drinks, and cereal foods.

   nitrogen use efficiency and/or vigor of a plant, as follows.

              Database assembly is comprised of a toolbox of gene refining, structuring,
    annotation and analysis tools enabling to construct a tailored database for each gene
    discovery project. Gene refining and structuring tools enable to reliably detect splice
   variants and antisense transcripts, generating understanding of various potential
 5 phenotypic outcomes of a single gene. The capabilities of the "LEADS" platform of
   Compugen LTD for analyzing human genome have been confirmed and accepted by the
   scientific community [see e.g., "Widespread Antisense Transcription", Yelin, et al.
   (2003) Nature Biotechnology 21, 379-85; "Splicing of Alu Sequences", Lev-Maor, et al.
   (2003) Science 300 (5623), 1288-91; "Computational analysis of alternative splicing
10 using EST tissue information", Xie H et al. Genomics 2002], and have been proven
   most efficient in plant genomics as well.
             EST clustering and gene assembly - For gene clustering and assembly of
   organisms with available genome sequence data (arabidopsis, rice, castorbean, grape,
   brachypodium, poplar, soybean, sorghum) the genomic LEADS version (GANG) was
15 employed. This tool allows most accurate clustering of ESTs and mRNA sequences on
   genome, and predicts gene structure as well as alternative splicing events and anti-sense
   transcription.
             For organisms with no available full genome sequence data, "expressed
   LEADS" clustering software was applied.
20           Gene annotation - Predicted genes and proteins were annotated as follows:
             Blast search [Hypertext Transfer Protocol://blast (dot) ncbi (dot) nlm (dot) nih
   (dot)   gov /Blast (dot)      cgi]  against all plant    UniProt    [Hypertext    Transfer
   Protocol://World Wide Web (dot) uniprot (dot) org/] sequences was performed. Open
   reading frames of each putative transcript were analyzed and longest ORF with higher
25 number of homologues was selected as predicted protein of the transcript.             The
   predicted proteins were analyzed by InterPro [Hypertext Transfer Protocol://World
   Wide Web (dot) ebi (dot) ac (dot) uk/interpro/].
             Blast against proteins from AraCyc and ENZYME databases was used to map
   the predicted transcripts to AraCyc pathways.
30           Predicted proteins from different species were compared using blast algorithm

                                                 54
   /Blast (dot) cgi] to validate the accuracy of the predicted protein sequence, and for
   efficient detection of orthologs.
              Gene expression profiling - Several data sources were exploited for gene
   expression profiling which combined microarray data and digital expression profile (see
 5 below). According to gene expression profile, a correlation analysis was performed to
   identify genes which are co-regulated under different developmental stages and
   environmental conditions and which are associated with different phenotypes.
              Publicly available microarray datasets were downloaded from TAIR and
   NCBI GEO sites, renormalized, and integrated into the database. Expression profiling
10 is one of the most important resource data for identifying genes important for yield.
              A digital expression profile summary was compiled for each cluster according
   to all keywords included in the sequence records comprising the cluster. Digital
   expression, also known as electronic Northern Blot, is a tool that displays virtual
   expression profile based on the EST sequences forming the gene cluster.            The tool
15 provides the expression profile of a cluster in terms of plant anatomy (e.g., the
   tissue/organ in which the gene is expressed), developmental stage (the developmental
   stages at which a gene can be found) and profile of treatment (provides the
   physiological conditions under which a gene is expressed such as drought, cold,
   pathogen infection, etc). Given a random distribution of ESTs in the different clusters,
20 the digital expression provides a probability value that describes the probability of a
   cluster having a total of N ESTs to contain X ESTs from a certain collection of libraries.
   For the probability calculations, the following is taken into consideration: a) the number
   of ESTs in the cluster, b) the number of ESTs of the implicated and related libraries, c)
   the overall number of ESTs available representing the species. Thereby clusters with
25 low probability values are highly enriched with ESTs from the group of libraries of
   interest indicating a specialized expression.
              Recently, the accuracy of this system was demonstrated by Portnoy et al.,
   2009 (Analysis Of The Melon Fruit Transcriptome Based On 454 Pyrosequencing) in:
   Plant & Animal Genomes XVII Conference, San Diego, CA. Transcriptomic analysis,
30 based on relative EST abundance in data was performed by 454 pyrosequencing of
   cDNA representing mRNA of the melon fruit. Fourteen double strand cDNA samples
   obtained from two genotypes, two fruit tissues (flesh and rind) and four developmental

   WO 2009/141824                                                          PCT/IL2009/000508
                                                 55
    stages were sequenced. GS FLX pyrosequencing (Roche/454 Life Sciences) of non
    normalized and purified cDNA samples yielded 1,150,657 expressed sequence tags that
    assembled into 67,477 unigenes (32,357 singletons and 35,120 contigs). Analysis of the
   data   obtained    against  the   Cucurbit   Genomics Database       [Hypertext Transfer
 5 Protocol://World Wide Web (dot) icugi (dot) org/] confirmed the accuracy of the
   sequencing and assembly. Expression patterns of selected genes fitted well their qRT
   PCR data.
              The concepts of orthology and paralogy have recently been applied to
   functional characterizations and classifications on the scale of whole-genome
10 comparisons. Orthologs and paralogs constitute two major types of homologs: The first
   evolved from a common ancestor by specialization, and the latter are related by
   duplication events. It is assumed that paralogs arising from ancient duplication events
   are likely to have diverged in function while true orthologs are more likely to retain
   identical function over evolutionary time.
15           To identify putative orthologs of the genes affecting plant yield, oil yield, oil
   content, seed yield, growth rate, vigor, biomass, abiotic stress tolerance and/or nitrogen
   use efficiency, all sequences were aligned using the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment
   Search Tool). Sequences sufficiently similar were tentatively grouped. These putative
   orthologs were further organized under a Phylogram - a branching diagram (tree)
20 assumed to be a representation of the evolutionary relationships among the biological
   taxa. Putative ortholog groups were analyzed as to their agreement with the phylogram
   and in cases of disagreements these ortholog groups were broken accordingly.
   Expression data was analyzed and the EST libraries were classified using a fixed
   vocabulary of custom terms such as developmental stages (e.g., genes showing similar
25 expression profile through development with up regulation at specific stage, such as at
   the seed filling stage) and/or plant organ (e.g., genes showing similar expression profile
   across their organs with up regulation at specific organs such as seed). The annotations
   from all the ESTs clustered to a gene were analyzed statistically by comparing their
   frequency in the cluster versus their abundance -in. the database, allowing the
30 construction of a numeric and graphic expression profile of that gene, which is termed
   "digital expression". The rationale of using these two complementary methods with
   methods of phenotypic association studies of QTLs, SNPs and phenotype expression

   WO 2009/141824                                                            PCT/IL2009/000508
                                                  56
    correlation is based on the assumption that true orthologs are likely to retain identical
   function over evolutionary time. These methods provide different sets of indications on
   function similarities between two homologous genes, similarities in the sequence level
   identical amino acids in the protein domains and similarity in expression profiles.
 5            Overall, 50 genes were identified to have a major impact on plant yield, seed
   yield, oil yield, oil content, biomass, growth rate, vigor, abiotic stress tolerance (ABST)
   and/or nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) when expressed in a plant. The identified genes,
   their curated polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences, as well as their updated
   sequences according to Genbank database are provided in Table 1, hereinbelow.

                                ANDIOR NUE OF A PLANT
 5           The search and identification of homologous genes involves the screening of
   sequence information available, for example, in public databases such as the DNA
   Database of Japan (DDBJ), Genbank, and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory
   Nucleic Acid Sequence Database (EMBL) or versions thereof or the MIPS database. A
   number of different search algorithms have been developed, including but not limited to
10 the suite of programs referred to as BLAST programs. There are five implementations
   of BLAST, three designed for nucleotide sequence queries (BLASTN, BLASTX, and
   TBLASTX) and two designed for protein sequence queries (BLASTP and TBLASTN)
   (Coulson, Trends in Biotechnology: 76-80, 1994; Birren et al., Genome Analysis, I:
   543, 1997). Such methods involve alignment and comparison of sequences. The
15 BLAST algorithm calculates percent sequence identity and performs a statistical
   analysis of the similarity between the two sequences. The software for performing
   BLAST analysis is publicly available through the National Centre for Biotechnology
   Information. Other such software or algorithms are GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA and
   TFASTA. GAP uses the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443
20 453, 1970) to find the alignment of two complete sequences that maximizes the number
   of matches and minimizes the number of gaps.
             The homologous genes may belong to the same gene family. The analysis of a
   gene family may be carried out using sequence similarity analysis. To perform this
   analysis one may use standard programs for multiple alignments e.g. Clustal W. A
25 neighbour-joining tree of the proteins homologous to the genes in this invention may be
   used to provide an overview of structural and ancestral relationships. Sequence identity
   may be calculated using an alignment program as described above. It is expected that
   other plants will carry a similar functional gene (ortholog) or a family of similar genes
   and those genes will provide the same preferred phenotype as the genes presented here.
30 Advantageously, these family members may be useful in the methods of the invention.
   Example of other plants are included here but not limited to, barley (Hordeum vulgare),
   Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), maize (Zea mays), cotton (Gossypium), Oilseed

   Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), Soybean (Glycine max), Sunflower (Helianthus annuus),
   Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), Wheat (Triticum aestivum).
             The above-mentioned analyses for sequence homology can be carried out on a
 5 full-length sequence, but may also be based on a comparison of certain regions such as
   conserved domains. The identification of such domains, would also be well within the
   realm of the person skilled in the art and would involve, for example, a computer
   readable format of the nucleic acids of the present invention, the use of alignment
   software programs and the use of publicly available information on protein domains,
10 conserved motifs and boxes. This information is available in the PRODOM (Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol://World Wide Web (dot) biochem (dot) ucl (dot) ac (dot)
   uk/bsm/dbbrowser/protocol/prodomqry        (dot)   html),   PIR    (Hypertext    Transfer
   Protocol://pir   (dot)  Georgetown     (dot)   edu/)   or   Pfam    (Hypertext   Transfer
   Protocol://World Wide Web (dot) sanger (dot) ac (dot) uk/Software/Pfam/) database.
15 Sequence analysis programs designed for motif searching may be used for identification
   of fragments, regions and conserved domains as mentioned above. Preferred computer
   programs include, but are not limited to, MEME, SIGNALSCAN, and GENESCAN.
             A person skilled in the art may use the homologous sequences provided herein
   to find similar sequences in other species and other organisms. Homologues of a protein
20 encompass, peptides, oligopeptides, polypeptides, proteins and enzymes having amino
   acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions relative to the unmodified protein in
   question and having similar biological and functional activity as the unmodified protein
   from which they are derived. To produce such homologues, amino acids of the protein
   may be replaced by other amino acids having similar properties (conservative changes,
25 such as similar hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, antigenicity, propensity to form or break
   a-helical structures or 3-sheet structures). Conservative substitution tables are well
   known in the art (see for example Creighton (1984) Proteins. W.H. Freeman and
   Company). Homologues of a nucleic acid encompass nucleic acids having nucleotide
   substitutions, deletions and/or insertions relative to the unmodified nucleic acid in
30 question and having similar biological and functional activity as the unmodified nucleic
   acid from which they are derived.

   capturing images of larger plants sawn in white tubs in an environmental controlled
20 greenhouse. The white tubs were square shape with measurements of 36 x 26.2 cm and
   7.5 cm deep. During the capture process, the tubs were placed beneath the iron mount,
   while avoiding direct sun light and casting of shadows. This process was repeated every
   3-4 days for up to 30 days.
              An image analysis system was used, which consists of a personal desktop
25 computer                          (Intel                      P4                        3.0
   GHz processor) and a public domain program - ImageJ 1.37, Java based image
   processing program, which was developed at the U.S National Institutes of Health and
   is freely available on the internet at Hypertext Transfer Protocol://rsbweb (dot) nih (dot)
   gov/. Images were captured in resolution of 6 Mega Pixels (3072 x 2048 pixels) and
30 stored in a low compression JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group standard) format.
   Next, analyzed data was saved to text files and processed using the JMP statistical
   analysis software (SAS institute).

             Leaf analysis - Using the digital analysis leaves data was calculated, including
   leaf number, area, perimeter, length and width. On day 30, 3-4 representative plants
   were chosen from each plot of blocks A, B and C. The plants were dissected, each leaf
   was separated and was introduced between two glass trays, a photo of each plant was
 5 taken and the various parameters (such as leaf total area, laminar length etc.) were
   calculated from the images (Figures la-d). The blade circularity was calculated as
   laminar width divided by laminar length.
             Root analysis - During 17 days, the different ecotypes were grown in
   transparent agar plates. The plates were photographed every 2 days starting at day 7 in
10 the photography room and the roots development was documented (Figures 2a-b). The
   growth rate was calculated according to the formula I as described above [Relative
   growth area rate = (A Area / At) * (1/ Area tO)].
             Vegetative growth rate analysis - The growth rate was calculated by dividing
   the area added (A Area) by the number of days for each interval (At). The analysis was
15 ended with the appearance of overlapping plants. The growth rate was calculated
   according to Formula IV.
             Formula IV:
             Growth rate = AArea / At.
             For comparison between ecotypes the calculated rate was normalized using
20 plant developmental stage as represented by the number of true leaves. In cases where
   plants with 8 leaves had been sampled twice (for example at day 10 and day 13), only
   the largest sample was chosen and added to the Anova comparison.
             Seeds in siliques analysis - On day 70, 15-17 siliques were collected from
   each plot in blocks D and E. The chosen siliques were light brown color but still intact.
25 The siliques were opened in the photography room and the seeds were scatter on a glass
   tray, a high resolution digital picture was taken for each plot. Using the images the
   number of seeds per silique was determined.
             Seeds average weight - At the end of the experiment all seeds from plots of
   blocks A-C were collected. An average weight of 0.02 grams was measured from each
30 sample, the seeds were scattered on a glass tray and a picture was taken. Using the
   digital analysis, the number of seeds in each sample was calculated.

             Oil percentage in seeds - At the end of the experiment all seeds from plots of
   blocks A-C were collected. Columbia seeds from 3 plots were mixed grounded and then
   mounted onto the extraction chamber. 210 ml of n-Hexane (Cat No. 080951 Biolab
   Ltd.) were used as the solvent. The extraction was performed for 30 hours at medium
 5 heat 50 1C. Once the extraction has ended the n-Hexane was evaporated using the
   evaporator at 35 *C and vacuum conditions. The process was repeated twice. The
   information gained from the Soxhlet extractor (Soxhlet, F. Die gewichtsanalytische
   Bestimmung des Milchfettes, Polytechnisches J. (Dingler's) 1879, 232, 461) was used to
   create a calibration curve for the Low Resonance NMR. The content of oil of all seed
10 samples was determined using the Low Resonance NMR (MARAN Ultra- Oxford
   Instrument) and its MultiQuant sowftware package.
             Silique length analysis - On day 50 from sowing, 30 siliques from different
   plants in each plot were sampled in block A. The chosen siliques were green-yellow in
   color and were collected from the bottom parts of a grown plant's stem. A digital
15 photograph was taken to determine silique's length.
             Dry weight and seed yield - On day 80 from sowing, the plants from blocks A
   C were harvested and left to dry at 30 *C in a drying chamber. The biomass and seed
   weight of each plot was separated, measured and divided by the number of plants. Dry
   weight = total weight of the vegetative portion above ground (excluding roots) after
20 drying at 30 *C in a drying chamber; Seed yield per plant = total seed weight per plant
   (gr).
             Oil yield - The oil yield was calculated using Formula V.
   Formula V:
             Seed Oil yield = Seed yield per plant (gr) * Oil %in seed
25           Harvest Index - The harvest index was calculated using Formula III as
   described above [Harvest Index = Average seed yield per plant/ Average dry weight].
             Experimental Results
             Nine different Arabidopsis ecotypes were grown and characterized for 18
   parameters (named as vectors). Data parameters are summarized in Table 4, below.

       GENE CLONING AND GENERATION OFBINARY VECTORS FOR PLANT

              To validate their role in improving oil content, plant yield, seed yield,
20 biomass, growth rate, ABST, NUE and/or vigor, selected genes were over-expressed in
   plants, as follows.
              Cloning strategy
               Genes listed in Example 1 hereinabove were cloned into binary vectors for the
   generation of transgenic plants. For cloning, the full-length open reading frame (ORF)
25 was first identified. In case of ORF-EST clusters and in some cases already published
   mRNA sequences were analyzed to identify the entire open reading frame by comparing
   the results of several translation algorithms to known proteins from other plant species.
   To clone the full-length cDNAs, reverse transcription (RT) followed by polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR; RT-PCR) was performed on total RNA extracted from leaves,

   flowers, siliques or other plant tissues, growing under normal conditions. Total RNA
   was extracted as described in Example 2 above.                Production of cDNA and PCR
   amplification was performed using standard protocols described elsewhere (Sambrook
   J., E.F. Fritsch, and T. Maniatis. 1989. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual., 2nd
 5 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York.) which are well known to those
   skilled in the art. PCR products were purified using PCR purification kit (Qiagen). In
   case where the entire coding sequence was not found, RACE kit from Ambion (RACE
   = _R_apid _A_ccess to _c_DNA _E_nds) was used to access the full cDNA transcript
   of the gene from the RNA samples described above. The RACE procedure was
10 performed for the genes BDL-108 (SEQ ID NO:726), BDL-110 (SEO ID NO:728) and
   BDL-111 (SEQ ID NO:730) using the primers sequences listed in Table 12, below.
   RACE products were cloned into high copy vector followed by sequencing. The
   information from the RACE procedure was used for cloning of the full length ORF of
   the corresponding genes.

              In case genomic DNA was cloned, as in the case of BDL119 gene, the gene
 5 was amplified by direct PCR on genomic DNA extracted from leaf tissue using the
   DNAeasy kit (Qiagen Cat. No. 69104).
              Usually, 2 sets of primers were synthesized for the amplification of each gene
   from a cDNA or a genomic sequence; an external set of primers and an internal set
   (nested PCR primers). When needed (e.g., when the first PCR reaction did not result in
10 a satisfactory product for sequencing), an additional primer (or two) of the nested PCR
   primers were used. Table 13 below provides primers used for cloning of selected genes.

              Sequencing of the amplified PCR products was performed, using ABI 377
   sequencer (Amersham Biosciences Inc). To facilitate cloning of the cDNAs/ genomic
   sequences, a 8-12 bp extension was added to the 5' of each primer. The primer extension
   includes an endonuclease restriction site. The restriction sites were selected using two
10 parameters: (a). The site did not exist in the cDNA sequence; and (b). The restriction
   sites in the forward and reverse primers were designed such that the digested cDNA is
   inserted in the sense formation into the binary vector utilized for transformation.
              PCR products were digested with the restriction endonucleases (New England
   BioLabs Inc) according to the sites design in the primers (Table 13, above) and cloned
15 into binary vectors according to Table 14, below. RACE products were sequenced as
   described hereinbelow for BDL108, BDL 110 and BDL111.

             The digested products and the linearized plasmid vector were ligated using T4
 5 DNA ligase enzyme (Roche, Switzerland). The plasmid pPI was constructed by
   inserting a synthetic poly-(A) signal sequence, originating from pGL3 basic plasmid
   vector (Promega, Acc No U47295; bp 4658-4811) into the HindIII restriction site of the
   binary vector pBI101.3 (Clontech, Acc. No. U12640). pGI (Figure 3) is similar to pPI,
   but the original gene in the backbone, the GUS gene, was replaced by the GUS-Intron
10 gene followed by the NOS terminator (SEQ ID NO:776) (Vancanneyt. G, et al MGG
   220, 245-50, 1990). pGI was used to clone the polynucleotide sequences, initially under
   the control of 35S promoter [Odell, JT, et al. Nature 313, 810 - 812 (28 February 1985);
   SEQ ID NO:777.
              Selected DNA sequences were synthesized by a commercial supplier GeneArt,
15 GmbH [Hypertext Transfer Protocol://World Wide Web (dot) geneart (dot) com/)].
   Synthetic DNA is designed in silico. Suitable restriction enzymes sites were added to
   the cloned sequences at the 5' end and at the 3' end to enabled later cloning into the
   pBXYN binary downstream of the CaMV 35S promoter (SEQ ID NO: 777).
              Optimization of genes for expression in dicotyledonousplants - To optimize
20 the coding sequence (in silico design), codon-usage Tables calculated from plant
   transcriptoms were used [example of such Tables can be found in the Codon Usage
   Database available online at Hypertext Transfer Protocol://World Wide Web (dot)

   way that no changes are introduced in the encoded amino acid sequence (of selected

   dicotyledonous plants mainly Arabidopsis, Tomato, Canola and Soya while avoiding
   rare codons for Arabidopsis; and monocotyledonous plants such as maize.            Such
   optimized sequences promote better translation rate and therefore higher protein
 5 expression levels. The genes for which codon optimized synthetic (artificial) sequences
   were prepared are:     BDL-113 (SEQ ID NO:663 polynucleotide, SEQ ID NO:57
   polypeptide), BDL-127 (SEQ ID NO:673 polynucleotide, SEQ ID NO:67 polypeptide),
   BDL-129 (SEQ ID NO:675 polynucleotide, SEQ ID NO:69 polypeptide), BDL-130
   (SEQ ID NO:676 polynucleotide, SEQ ID NO:712 polypeptide), BDL-134 (SEQ ID
10 NO:680 polynucleotide, SEQ ID NO:74 polypeptide), BDL-137 (SEQ. ID NO:683

   polynucleotide, SEQ ID NO:79 polypeptide).
             Several polynucleotide   sequences of the selected genes were cloned
15 downstream of the CaMV 35S promoter (SEQ ID NO:777), the Arabidopsis At6669
   promoter (SEQ ID NO:775) or the Napin seed specific promoter (SEQ ID NO:778).
             The Napin (SEQ ID NO:778) promoter, which originates from Brassica napus,
   is characterized by a seed specific promoter activity [Stuitje A. R. et. al. Plant
   Biotechnology Journal 1 (4): 301-309]. The Napin promoter was amplified by direct
20 PCR on genomic DNA extracted from leaf tissue [using the DNAeasy kit (Qiagen Cat.
   No.   69104)]    using  the   following   PCR    primers:    Napin     F   HindIII 5'
   ATAAGCTTATTGATTCCTTAAAGACTTATGTTr (SEQ ID NO:993) and Napin R
   SalI 5'- TCGTCGACGGGTGTATGTFITAATCTTGTTT (SEQ ID NO:994).                            An
   example of a gene cloned downstream of the Napin promoter sequence is BDL65 (SEQ
25 ID NO:700).

             Plant transformation - The Arabidopsis thaliana var Columbia (To plants)
10 were transformed according to the Floral Dip procedure [Clough SJ, Bent AF. (1998)
   Floral dip: a simplified method for Agrobacterium-mediated            transformation of
   Arabidopsis thaliana. Plant J. 16(6): 735-43; and Desfeux C, Clough SJ, Bent AF.
   (2000) Female reproductive tissues are the primary targets of Agrobacterium-mediated
   transformation by the Arabidopsis floral-dip method. Plant Physiol. 123(3): 895-904]
15 with minor modifications. Briefly, Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia (Col0) To plants
   were sown in 250 ml pots filled with wet peat-based growth mix. The pots were
   covered with aluminum foil and a plastic dome, kept at 4 *C for 3-4 days, then
   uncovered and incubated in a growth chamber at 18-24 *C under 16/8 hours light/dark
   cycles. The To plants were ready for transformation six days before anthesis.
20           Single colonies of Agrobacterium carrying the binary vectors harboring the
   seed oil genes were cultured in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 mg/L)
   and gentamycin (50 mg/L). The cultures were incubated at 28 *C for 48 hours under
   vigorous shaking and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes. The pellets comprising
   Agrobacterium cells were resuspended in a transformation medium which contained
25 half-strength (2.15 g/L) Murashige-Skoog (Duchefa); 0.044 pM benzylamino purine
   (Sigma); 112 pg/L B5 Gambourg vitamins (Sigma); 5 % sucrose; and 0.2 ml/L Silwet
   L-77 (OSI Specialists, CT) in double-distilled water, at pH of 5.7.
             Transformation of To plants was performed by inverting each plant into an
   Agrobacterium suspension such that the above ground plant tissue was submerged for
30 3-5 seconds. Each inoculated To plant was immediately placed in a plastic tray, then
   covered with clear plastic dome to maintain humidity and was kept in the dark at room
   temperature for 18 hours to facilitate infection and transformation.        Transformed

    (transgenic) plants were then uncovered and transferred to a greenhouse for recovery
    and maturation. The transgenic To plants were grown in the greenhouse for 3-5 weeks
    until siliques were brown and dry, then seeds were harvested from plants and kept at
    room temperature until sowing.
 5             For generating T1 and T2 transgenic plants harboring the genes, seeds collected
   from transgenic To plants were surface-sterilized by soaking in 70 % ethanol for 1
   minute, followed by soaking in 5 % sodium hypochlorite and 0.05 % triton for 5
   minutes. The surface-sterilized seeds were thoroughly washed in sterile distilled water
   then placed on culture plates containing half-strength Murashig-Skoog (Duchefa); 2 %
10 sucrose; 0.8 % plant agar; 50 mM kanamycin; and 200 mM carbenicylin (Duchefa).
   The culture plates were incubated at 4 *C for 48 hours then transferred to a growth room
   at 25 *C for an additional week of incubation.           Vital T1 Arabidopsis plants were
   transferred to a fresh culture plates for another week of incubation.              Following
   incubation the T1 plants were removed from culture plates and planted in growth mix
15 contained in 250 ml pots. The transgenic plants were allowed to grow in a greenhouse
   to maturity. Seeds harvested from T1 plants were cultured and grown to maturity as T 2
   plants under the same conditions as used for culturing and growing the T1 plants.

20                      IDENTIFICATION OF NOVEL PROMOTERS
              Constitutive promoters allow continuous expression of genes regulated
   thereby throughout the plant. A widely used example for a constitutive promoter is the
   CaMV35S promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus (SEQ ID NO:777).
              One of the important requirements for an engineered plant is to activate the
25 gene-of-interest in the right tissue or organ, and/or at the appropriate time (e.g., a certain
   developmental stage, under certain environmental conditions). For example, in order to
   influence a unique tissue such as seed, the gene-of-interest may be induced for
   expression (activated) at a certain developmental stage such as pre embryo fertilization,
   post fertilization, early or late embryogenesis. For example, to improve yield and/or oil
30 content of a plant, the expression of the gene-of-interest may be regulated by a promoter
   having an expression pattern appropriate for seed development. Thus, the combination
   of a target gene with specific promoters such as developmental specific promoter (such

   as seed, carpel, stem, seedling) may increase the desired effect of the gene (e.g.,
   improve yield and/or oil content) and may avoid undesired influence of the gene on
   other biological processes in other tissues, for example, cell structure, plant architecture.
                 The present inventors have isolated and validated novel developmental
 5 specific promoters from different stages of plant development and/or plant tissues,
   having different levels of gene expression. The following description summarizes the
   process of selection and cloning of the novel Arabidopsis promoters.
                 Cloning and analysis of promoters - The novel Arabidopsis promoters of the
    invention were selected based on the expression profile of the native genes positioned
10  downstream (3') to the promoter sequences (see Table 16, below).

 5                  IMPROVED TRANSGENIC PLANT PERFORMANCE
              To analyze the effect of expression of the isolated polynucleotides in plants,
   plants were grown in pots with an adequate amount of nutrients and water. The plants
   were analyzed for their overall size, growth rate, time to inflorescence emergence
   (bolting) and flowering, seed yield, weight of 1,000 seeds, dry matter and harvest index
10 [(HI) seed yield/ dry matter]. Transgenic plants performance was compared to control
   plants grown in parallel under the same conditions. Mock- transgenic plants with an
   empty vector or expressing the uidA reporter gene (GUS-Intron) under the same
   promoter were used as control.
              Parameters were measured as described in Example 3 above.
15            Statistical analyses - Plant growth rate, plant area, time to bolt, time to flower,
   weight of 1,000 seeds, seed yield, oil yield, dry matter, and harvest index area data were
   analyzed using t-test. To identify outperforming genes and constructs, results from mix
   of transformation events or independent events were analyzed. For gene versus control
   analysis t- test was applied, using significance of p < 0.1. The JMP statistics software
20 package was used (Version 5.2.1, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
              Experimental Results
              Plants expressing the polynucleotides of the invention were assayed for a
   number of commercially desired traits. Table 22 provides the parameters measured in a
    tissue culture assay (results are presented in Table 23).

                Greenhouse assays - Tables 25, 26 and 27 represent experiments that were
   done using greenhouse assays. Table 24 specifies the parameters that were measured in
   the green house assays and which are presented in Tables 25, 26 and 27. In cases where
   a certain event appears more than once, the event was tested in several independent
10 experiments.

                   The relative growth rate for the various seedling parameters was calculated
     according to the following Formulas.
                   Formula VI:
                   Relative growth rate of leaf area = (A rosette area / At) * (1/ rosette area t1)
 5                  A rosette area is the interval between the current rosette area (measured at t2 )
     and the rosette area measured at the previous day (Area ti)
                    At is the time interval (t2 -ti, in days) between the current analyzed image day
     (t 2 )  and the previous day (ti).
                    Thus, the relative growth rate of leaf area is in units of 1/day.
10                  Formula VII:
                    Relative growth rate of root coverage = (A root coverage area / At) * (1/ root
      coverage area ti)
                    A root coverage area is the interval between the current root coverage area
      (measured at t ) and the root coverage area measured at the previous day (Area ti)
                          2
15                  At is the time interval (t2-ti, in days) between the current analyzed image day
      (t 2 )  and the previous day (ti).
                    Thus, the relative growth rate of root coverage area is in units of 1/day.
                    Formula VIII:
                     Relative growth rate of root length = (A root length / At) * (1/ root length ti)
 20                  A root length is the interval between the current root length (measured at t 2 )
       and the root length measured at the previous day (Area ti)
                     At is the time interval (t 2 -ti, in days) between the current analyzed image day
       (t 2 )  and the previous day (ti).
                     Thus, the relative growth rate of root length is in units of 1/day.

    downregulate the expression level of the BDL127 gene in plants such as co-suppression
    agents, antisense suppression, RNA interference, remodeling of the promoter structure
    and/or Ribozyme can increase yield, seed yield, biomass and growth rate of a plant.
 5            The genes identified herein improve plant yield in general, and more
    specifically oil yield, seed yield, oil content, plant growth rate, plant biomass, root
    measurements, ABST, NUE and plant vigor. The output of the bioinformatics method
    described herein is a set of genes highly predicted to improve yield (seed yield, oil yield
    and content, biomass) and/or other agronomic important yields by modifying their
10  expression. Although each gene is predicted to have its own impact, modifying the
    mode of expression of more than one gene is expected to provide an additive or
    synergistic effect on the plant yield, plant growth rate, root measurements, ABST, NUE,
    plant vigor and/or other agronomic important yields performance. Altering the
    expression of each gene described here alone or set of genes together increases the
15  overall yield plant growth rate, root measurements, ABST, NUE, plant vigor and/or
