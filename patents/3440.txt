   Field of the Invention
            This invention relates to laser imaging.

   Background of the Invention
            There are many attractions in using non-contact near-IR sources, in particular diode
   and fibre lasers, to generate images from coatings for applications such as variable
   information packaging.     Favourable attributes of diode and fibre lasers such as economy,
10 portability and ease of use, are attractive for current needs in the packaging industry, such as
   in-store labelling.
            Virtually all colour change materials used in laser sensitive coatings absorb mid-IR
   radiation and therefore can be activated using mid-IR lasers such as CO 2 lasers that emit
   radiation at approximately 10.6 microns. However, these same colour change materials
15 usually have negligible absorbance in the near-IR region and consequently they cannot be
   activated using near-IR lasers that emit in the 700 to 2,500nm region. Near-IR lasers are
   often more convenient to use than CO 2 lasers particularly in term of retrofitting to production
   lines due to their more compact size. Also near-IR lasers are more readily made into an
   individually addressed 'array' type emitting device than CO 2 lasers are, which due to the
20 absence of moving galvo mirrors offers the potential to image at fast line speeds.
            However, by incorporating, into these same ink formulations, materials which
   absorb radiation from near-IR sources such as diode and fibre lasers, coatings have been
   produced which will generate a distinct coloured image on exposure to near, as well as mid
   or far-IR irradation.
25          WO 2005/068207 describes an ink formulation comprising a marking component
   and a metal salt that absorbs laser irradiation at 700-2000nm and thereby causes the marking
   component to change colour. This allows the utilization of diode and CO 2 lasers for imaging
   applications on packaging, for example.
            WO 2007/141522 describes an ink formulation comprising a marking component
30 and a metal salt that absorbs laser irradiation at 780-2500 nm and thereby causes the marking
   component to change colour. A preferred metal salt is reduced indium tin oxide.
            EP2361783 describes a thermosensitive recording medium including a support; an
   image recording layer on the support; and an inorganic material in particle form as a light
   heat conversion material, wherein the inorganic material has a ratio of Y to X, represented by
35 Y/X, of 2 or greater, where X denotes an average value of absorption intensities with respect

                                                     2
   to light having wavelengths in the range of 400 nm to 700 nm, and Y denotes a maximum
   value among absorption intensities with respect to light having wavelengths greater than 700
   nm but smaller than or equal to 1,200 nm. The light-heat conversion material may include
   particles of at least one of a metal boride and a metal oxide and a tungsten oxide compound
 5 is mentioned as an option for the metal oxide. The disclosure focuses on the formation of a
   thermoreversible recording medium.
            It is desirable to provide to provide further ink formulations having good laser
   imaging efficacy, but which have an essentially negligible impact on the background colour
   of the coating.

   efficiency near-infrared absorption film with tungsten bronze nanoparticle dense layer"
   (Nanoscale Res Lett. 2014; 9(1): 294), "Thermal plasma synthesis of tungsten bronze

   0. 34 WO 3  and most preferably, the near infrared absorbing system comprises CsW 1 .6 0 6 and
   Cso. 32 WO 3 .   A powder of this composition can be obtained from Shanghai huzheng
   nanotechnology Co., Ltd under the name GTO-P 100.
              In the first aspect of the invention, it is preferred that the compound of the formula
20 MlW1.606 and      the tungsten bronze of the formula MxWyOz are present at a ratio Of MIW1.606
                      2M

   1:2, most preferably from 1:10 to 1:5. The ratio of the components can be determined by X
   ray diffraction.
              Similarly, in the second aspect of the invention, it is preferred that the compound of
25 the formula M pWnOq and the tungsten bronze of the formula M2xWyOz are present at a ratio
   of MIpWnOq : M 2 xWYOz of from 1:100 to 5:1, preferably from 1:50 to 1:1, more preferably
   from 1:20 to 1:2, most preferably from 1:10 to 1:5. The ratio of the components can be
   determined by X-ray diffraction.
              In another preferred embodiment, the near infrared absorbing system has a ratio of a
30 to    p represented by a/p, of less than 2, where       p denotes an average value of absorption
   intensities with respect to light having wavelengths in the range of 400 nm to 700 nm, and a
   denotes a maximum value among absorption intensities with respect to light having
   wavelengths greater than 700 nm but smaller than or equal to 1,200 nm. Generally, the ratio
   of a to    p, represented  by a/p is less than 1.9 or less than 1.8. Usually, the ratio of a to p,

                                                     5
   represented by a/P is at least 0.8, at least 1, or at least 1.1. Most preferably, the ratio of a to
     , represented by a/p, is in the range 1.0 to 1.5.
             p and a of the near infrared absorbing system powder can be readily determined
   using a suitable spectrophotometer operating in absorbance mode.
 5           The near infrared absorbing system is preferably in the form of a powder.
   Preferably, the powder has an average particle size in the range 1 nm to 1,000 nm, preferably
   1 nm to 500 nm, even more preferably 1 nm to 200 nm, and most preferably 1 nm to 100 nm.
   The near infrared absorbing system can either have the required particle size when the ink is

10 particle size referred to is the D[4,3] average, which can be measured by laser diffraction for
   example.
             The concentration of the near infrared absorbing system should be enough to render
   any subsequent coatings imageable, but have essentially negligible impact on the background
   colour of the coating. Preferably the concentration of the near infrared absorbing system in
15 the ink is 0.05 to 10% w/w, more preferably 0.1 to 2.5% w/w and most preferably 0.25 to 1%
   w/w. Preferably, the concentration of the near infrared absorbing system is one that imparts
   to the ink acceptable imageability, but has a background colour difference of EWE less than or
   equal to 5.0, measured at a coatweight of 5gsm on white paper, as compared to the same ink
   formulation without the presence of a near infrared absorbing system.
20
   Colour Change Agent
             The colour change agent can generate colour in response to an energy source.
   Preferably, the colour change agent is an irreversible colour change agent.              However,
   reversible colour change agents are also within the scope of the present invention.
25           The term "irreversible" means that the colour, once generated, cannot be deliberately
   erased and then re-coloured. The colour can change into another colour, but it cannot be
   made to return to a colourless state or its original colour, and then converted back again to
   the initial generated colour.
             The term "irreversible" does exclude the possibility that colour may fade gradually
30 on exposure to background environmental conditions such as sunlight.
             The colour change agent can be an inorganic metal oxyanion compound such as a
   molybdate, tungstate or chromate, preferably wherein the cation is an alkali metal or an
   alkaline earth metal or ammonium.           One example is sodium molybdate.           Particularly
   preferred are ammonium salts of metal oxyanions. Most preferably, the colour change agent
35 is ammonium octamolybdate. Further suitable examples are taught in WO 02/074548.

                                                   6
             The colour change agent can be an organic colour former. Examples include leuco
   dyes. These can be photochromic, which change colour on exposure to light such as UV
   light, or halochromic, which change colour on exposure to changes in environmental pH.
   Halochromic organic colour formers can be used in combination with a colour developer
 5 such as a lewis acid compound, or acid generating agent such as a thermal acid generating
   agent, particularly an irreversible thermal acid generating agent.
             Examples of organic halochromic colour formers include those that are based on
   triphenylmethane, fluorans, phenothiazines, auramines, spiropyrans and indolinophthalides.
   Particularly preferred are black halochromic colour formers. Examples of suitable leuco dyes
