Abstract of the Disclosure
             A holding tool for use in holding a first portion of an item, such as a hydraulic coupling, in a static
position, while a torque application tool applies torque and rotates a second portion of the item. The holding
tool helps reduce twisting of the first portion relative to the second portion when torque is applied. The
holding tool also communicates with a controller when the tool is in use. For example, the tool
communicates with the controller in response to a user applying a force to the tool in a direction of the first
portion the tool is engaged with. That force releases pressure on a switch that activates a communication
signal for communication to the controller. This allows the controller to monitor whether the holding tool
was used in conjunction with a torque wrench to tighten the coupling; thereby providing an error reducing
function.

Cross-Reference to Related Applications
            This application is a continuation of and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application
Serial No. 62/429,174, filed December 2, 2016, entitled Torque Holding Wrench, the contents of which are
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
Technical Field of the Invention
            The present invention relates generally to torque application tools. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a tool for holding a portion of a work piece while torque is applied to a second portion of
the work piece.
Background of the Invention
            In many industrial applications, the tightening of items with threaded fasteners to a specific degree
or torque is of critical importance. For example, in the assembly of automobiles or aircraft, it is important
that nuts, bolts, screws, lugs, and the like (which, for brevity, will all be referred to as "fasteners") are
sufficiently tightened to ensure that the resulting assembly functions properly, not only at initial use, but over
the long term. Over-tightening, however, may strip the threads or cause vibrational problems in the
assembly.
            Further, it is useful to maintain portions of the item being connected, such as, for example, a
hydraulic hose at a specified position when a torque wrench is used to install such connectors, couplings or
fittings. This ensures proper positioning of the hydraulic hose/pipe for operation and reduces twisting forces
from being applied to the hose, coupling, or fitting. Such twisting forces can cause damage to the hose/pipe
and reduce the life of the coupling or fitting. For example, a twist of about seven (7) degrees can reduce hose
service life by up to about 90%.
Summary of the Invention
            The present invention broadly comprises a tool, such as a holding tool, that may be used in parallel
with a torque application tool, such as a torque wrench. The holding tool is used to hold a first portion of an
item being fastened, such as a hydraulic hose, in a static position, while the torque application tool applies
torque and rotates a second portion of the item. The holding tool helps prevent application of torque to the
first portion of the item, thus preventing twisting of a hose, pipe, and/or coupling.
            In an embodiment, the holding tool also wirelessly communicates with a controller when the tool is
in use. For example, the tool may indicate that it is in use. The tool communicates with the controller in

                                                          -2
response to a user applying a thrust or force to the tool in a direction of the coupling the tool is engaged with.
That thrust releases pressure on a switch that activates a communication signal, such as a coded radio signal,
for communication to the controller. This allows the controller to monitor whether the holding tool was used
in conjunction with a torque application tool.

Detailed Description of the Embodiments
            While the present invention is susceptible of embodiments in many different forms, there is shown in
the drawings, and will herein be described in detail, embodiments of the invention, including a preferred
embodiment, with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of
the principles of the present invention and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the invention to any
one or more embodiments illustrated herein. As used herein, the term "present invention" is not intended to
limit the scope of the claimed invention, but is instead used to discuss exemplary embodiments of the
invention for explanatory purposes only.
            The present invention broadly comprises a tool, such as a holding tool, that may be used with a
torque application tool, such as a torque wrench, when connecting an item having first and second portions.
The first portion of the item may be a hose or other device where rotation is not desired. The second portion
of the item may be a coupling where torque application and rotation is not desired. For example, the item
may be a hydraulic brake hose that includes a hose as the first portion and a rotatable coupling as the second
portion. Thus, in an embodiment, the present invention allows torque to be applied to the second portion of
the item, and thus causes the second portion to rotate, while the first portion of the item remains static.
            The holding tool helps prevent twisting of a hose, pipe, and/or the first portion of the item while
torque is applied to the second portion. In an embodiment, the holding tool also wirelessly communicates
with a controller when the tool is in use. For example, the tool may indicate that it is in use. The tool
communicates with the controller in response to a user applying a thrust or force to the tool in a direction of
the coupling the tool is engaged with. That thrust releases pressure on a switch that activates a
communication signal, such as a coded radio signal, for communication to the controller. This allows the
controller to monitor whether the holding tool was used in conjunction with a torque application tool.

                                                       -4
            For example, the controller may be used to monitor that the holding tool is engaged with a coupling
during the torqueing operation, that the holding tool is fully engaged until after a target torque value has been
attained (as indicated by a torque wrench in communication with the controller), and that the target torque
value or target torque and angle values have been attained (as indicated by a torque wrench in
communication with the controller). If the above criteria are not met, the controller may indicate that the
operation has not been performed properly, and should be completed again.
            Referring to FIGS 1-3, a tool 100, such as a holding tool, includes a housing 102, a transducer beam
104, a torque block 106. a handle 108, and an interface module 110. The housing 102 includes a first housing
portion 112 proximal to a first end and a second housing portion 114 proximal to a second end. The first
housing portion 112 is hollow and is adapted to receive a transducer beam 104. Similarly, the second housing
portion 114 is hollow and is adapted to receive the torque block 106. As illustrated, the first housing portion
112 has an oblong cross-sectional shape, and the second housing portion 114 has a circular cross-sectional
shape. However, the first and second housing portions 112, 114 may have other geometrical cross-sectional
shapes.
            The transducer beam 104 and torque block 106 are coupled together, for example via one or more
fasteners or pins 116, and are disposed in the housing 102, with a head 118 of the transducer beam 104
positioned outside of the housing 102 proximal to the first end of the housing 102. The transducer beam 104
is coupled to the housing 102 by pins 120. The pins 120 respectively extend through apertures 122 in the
housing 102, and apertures 124 in the transducer beam 104. The pins 120 may also be secured in place using
one or more respective retaining rings 126.
            A spring 128 is disposed in the housing 102 and around the torque block 106, and the handle 108 is
disposed on and coupled to the second end of the housing 102. One or more spacers, such as washers 130,
may be disposed between the spring 128 and an internal end of the handle 108. The torque block 106 may
also include a stop 132, formed as a ledge, that prevents the spring 128 from traveling in a direction towards
the transducer beam 104. The spring 128 may abut the stop 132, and the washers 130. The spring 128
provides a bias force to the torque block 106, and thereby the transducer beam 104, in a direction of the head
118. This cause the head 118 to extend from the first end of the housing 102.
            The interface module 110 may include a switch 134, and the interface module, may be coupled to the
housing 102, and extend through an aperture 136 in the torque block 106 and transducer beam 104. As
illustrated, the apertures 124 in the transducer beam 104 have an oblong shape. This allows the torque block
106 and transducer beam 104 to move within the housing 102. As described above, the spring 128 provides a
bias force to the torque block 106, and thereby the transducer beam 104, in a direction of the head 118. This
also biases the switch 134 into an OFF position. When force is applied to the head 118 in a direction towards
the handle 108 (or a force is applied to the handle 108 in a direction (illustrated as arrow 144) towards the
97485341 (GHMatters) P107411.AU

                                                       -5
head 118), the oblong shape of the apertures 124 allow the transducer beam 104 and torque block 106 to
move against the bias force of the spring 128 in a direction towards the handle 108. This movement releases
the bias force applied to the switch 134, and allows the switch 134 to move to an ON position. In the ON
position, the interface module 110 transmits a signal indicating that the tool 100 is in use, and an indicator
138 of the interface module 110 is activated. The indicator 138 may be a light that is illuminated to indicate
to a user that the tool 100 is in use and the signal is being transmitted. Using thrust force to activate the tool
100 is similar to using a screwdriver. This helps focus the user/operator to hold the hose/pipe, or coupling in
a static position while a torqueing operation is performed with a separate torque application tool. For
example, the tool 100 may be used to hold a first portion of an item in a static position, while the torque
application tool is used to apply torque to a second portion of the item. The tool 100 may also be used to hold
a first coupling in a static position, while the torque application tool is used to apply torque to a second
coupling.
            The head 118 of the tool 100 is adapted to receive and couple to varying different interchangeable
tool heads. For example, the head 118 may be shaped and adapted to engage a corresponding female
connection of an interchangeable tool head. The head 118 may also include a pin 140 and spring 142
disposed in and coupled to the head 118. For example, the pin 140 and spring 142 may be disposed in a blind
hole in the head 118, and the pin 140 is biased outwardly by the spring 142. The interchangeable nature of
the head 118 and tool heads allows the tool 100 to be adapted to engage varying types of fittings and
fasteners. Examples of tool heads that may be coupled to the head 118 are illustrated in FIGS. 4-14.
            Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, a tool head 200 is illustrated. The tool head 200 is an open end type
wrench head, and includes channels 202 and 204 adapted to respectively engage the head 118 and pin 140.
To couple the tool head 200 to the head, the pin 140 may be pushed inwardly against the bias of the spring
142, and the head 118 slid into the channel 202 until the pin 140 is pushed into the channel 204 by the spring
142.
            Referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, a tool head 300 is illustrated. The tool head 300 is a ratcheting open end
type wrench head, and includes channels 302 and 304 adapted to respectively engage the head 118 and pin
140. FIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate a box head type of wrench head 400 that includes channels 402 and 404 adapted
to respectively engage the head 118 and pin 140. FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate a flare head type of wrench head
500 that includes channels 502 and 504 adapted to respectively engage the head 118 and pin 140. FIG. 12
illustrates a square drive ratchet type of wrench head 600 that includes channels 602 and 604 adapted to
respectively engage the head 118 and pin 140. FIG. 13 illustrates a square drive type of wrench head 700 that
includes channels 702 and 704 adapted to respectively engage the head 118 and pin 140. Similarly, FIG. 14
illustrates a hex drive type of wrench head 800 that includes channels 802 and 804 adapted to respectively
engage the head 118 and pin 140. It should be appreciated that any type of tool head can be adapted to
97485341 (GHMatters) P107411.AU

                                                       -6
include channels that respectively engage the head 118 and pin 140. Thus, the tool 100 can be coupled with
any type of tool head to suit a particular need or application.
            Referring to FIG. 15, the interface module 110 on the tool 100 may be in communication with a
controller 900, when the interface module 110 in in the ON position. A torque wrench 1000 may also be in
communication with the controller 900. The use of the tool 100, torque wrench 1000, and controller 900
together provide an error reducing function. For example, when tightening a hose/pipe or coupling, such as a
hydraulic hose, hydraulic coupling connection, or other connection that requires a counter torque reaction,
the tool 100 may be used to provide the counter torque. During use, a user engages the tool 100 with a first
portion of an item that is to be held stationary, and engages the torque wrench 1000 with a second portion of
the item that is to be torqued or rotated. Both of the tool 100 and the torque wrench 1000 may be in
communication with the controller 900. For example, when a thrust force is applied to the tool 100, such as
the handle in a directions towards the head of the tool 100, the interface module 110 is turned ON. The
torque wrench 1000 may be in communication with the controller 900 and transmit torque and/or angle
information to the controller 900.
            The controller 900 receives the signals from the tool 100 and torque wrench 1000 and monitors the
tightening operation. For example, the controller 900 records and monitors that both the tool 100 and the
torque wrench 1000 are in operation at the same time, and that the tool 100 is engaged prior to, during, and
after the torque wrench 1000 is used. The tool 100 may be paired to the torque wrench 1000 prior to use to
assist the controller 900 in identifying that both of the tool 100 and the torque wrench 1000 were used. By
ensuring that both of the tool 100 and the torque wrench 1000 were used together, the controller 900
provides an error reducing function to assist in preventing hoses/pipes from being twisted and/or connections
misaligned, which could cause rework or increased failure or warranty costs.
            To facilitate communication with the controller 900, the interface module 110 of the tool 100 may
include various electronic components. For example, referring to FIG. 16, the interface module may include
a processor 146, memory/storage 148, transceiver 150, antenna 152, power source 154, switch 134, and
indicator 138. The processor 146 may include a central processing unit (CPU) for processing data and
computer-readable instructions. The processor 146 may retrieve instructions from memory/storage 148 via a
bus 156, using the memory/storage 148 for runtime temporary storage of instructions and data. The
memory/storage 148 may include volatile and/or nonvolatile random access memory (RAM). While
components are illustrated in FIG. 16 as being connected via the bus 156, components may also be connected
to other components in addition to (or instead of) being connected to other components via the bus 156.
            The memory/storage 148 stores the instructions, including instructions to manage communications
with the controller 900. The memory/storage 148 may include one-or-more types volatile and/or non-volatile
97485341 (GHMatters) P107411.AU

                                                        -7
solid-state storage, such as flash memory, read-only memory (ROM), magnetoresistive RAM (MRAM),
phase-change memory, random access memory (RAM)etc.
            Instructions for operating the tool 100 and its various components may be executed by the processor
146. The computer instructions may be stored in a non-transitory manner in non-volatile memory/storage
148, or an external device. Alternatively, some-or-all of the executable instructions may be embedded in
hardware or firmware in addition to or instead of software.
            The tool 100 may include multiple input and output interfaces. These interfaces include the
transceiver 150, switch 134, and indicator 138. The tool 100 may also include a speaker or audio transducer
158, and/or additional devices, such as a haptic feedback device, display, etc. These devices may provide an
indication when the interface module 110 is turned ON.
            Instructions executed by the processor 146 receive data from the input interfaces, such as the switch
134. From that data, the processor 146 may determine various information, such as that the tool 100 is being
used, and the switch in in the ON position, and optionally, the duration that the tool 100 is in use. The data
and information can be logged in real time or at a predetermined sampling rate and stored in a
memory/storage 148. The data and information may also be transmitted to the controller 900 for further
analysis and review.
            The transceiver 150 may include a transmitter, a receiver, and associated encoders, modulators,
demodulators, and decoders. The transceiver 150 manages the communication link, establishing the
communications link with the controller 900 via one-or-more antennas 152 embedded in the tool 100, and
enables unidirectional or bidirectional communication between the processor 146 and the controller 900. The
communications link may be a direct link between the tool 100/interface module 110 and the controller 900,
or may be an indirect link through one-or-more intermediate components, such as via a Wi-Fi router or mesh
connection.
            The tool 100/interface module 110 also includes a power source 154 to power the processor 146, the
bus 156, and other electronic components. For example, the power source 154 may be one-or-more batteries.
However, the power source 154 is not limited to batteries, and other technologies may be used, such as one
or more fuel cells, or solar cells, for example.
            The controller 900 may be a computer, or other device in a network. In an example, the controller
900 includes a processor, communications circuitry (such as a transceiver and antenna), memory, storage,
input and output devices (such as buttons, knobs, etc.), and a display screen, as known in the art. The
controller 900 may be capable of interfacing with a variety of tools to set parameters, job tasks,, etc. For
example, parameters or jobs can be input, transmitted, and assigned to tools, while the controller 900
97485341 (GHMatters) P107411.AU

                                                          -8
displays the required work and progress of the work to the user. As the user works through a task, the tools
and controller 900 provide auditory, tactile, and visual guidance or progress, and results.
            The torque wrench 1000 may also include a processor, communications circuitry (such as a
transceiver and antenna), memory, storage, input and output devices (such as buttons, knobs, etc.), and
torque and/or angle sensors, as known in the art. The torque sensor may include, for example, one-or-more of
a torque transducer, a strain gauge, a magnetoelastic torque sensor, and a surface acoustic wave (SAW)
sensor. The angle sensors may include, for example, one-or-more of a rotational angle sensor and an
electronic gyroscope (such as a two-or-three axes gyroscope). Instructions executed by the processor receive
data from the sensors, such as torque and angle values. From that data, the processor may determine various
information, such as the duration and amount of torque that has been or should be applied to a work piece.
The sensor data and information may then be transmitted to the controller 900, in real time or a
predetermined intervals.
            FIG. 17 is a process flow diagram illustrating a process 1700 according to an aspect of the present
invention. The holding tool 100 may be paired with a torque wrench, such as torque wrench 1000, illustrated
as block 1702. This pairing may be performed by a user via the controller 900.
            The tool 100 may then be engaged with a coupling (such as a first portion of a coupling, a first
coupling, connection, fitting, or hose, etc.), that is to be held in a static position, illustrated as block 1704.
The interface module 110 of the tool 100 is activated (switched to an ON position) in response to a thrust
force being applied to the handle of the tool 100 in a direction of the head of the tool 100, and
communication between the tool 100 and controller 900 is activated, illustrated as block 1706. The torque
wrench 1000 may also be engaged with a second portion of the coupling, a second coupling, connection,
fitting, or hose, etc., that is to be rotated, illustrated as block 1708, and communication between the torque
wrench 1000 and controller 900 activated, illustrated as block 1710. An appropriate amount of torque may
then be applied by the torque wrench 1000, illustrated as block 1712. As torque is applied, the controller 900
may be receiving signals from the tool 100 that the tool 100 is in use, and the torque wrench 1000 of the
torque/angle measurements, illustrated as block 1714.
            Once the appropriate torque is applied, the tool 100 and torque wrench 1000 may be disengaged with
the respective coupling(s), illustrated as block 1716. The controller 900 may then check the information
received to determine whether the tool 100 was engaged (or in use) prior to, during, and after the appropriate
torque was applied, illustrated as block 1718. If the tool 100 was engaged (or in use) prior to, during, and
after the appropriate torque was applied, the task is complete, illustrated as block 1720. However, if the tool
100 was not engaged (or not in use) prior to, during, and after the appropriate torque was applied, the
controller 900 may provide an error, illustrated as block 1722, indicating that the task should be redone or
rechecked. By ensuring that both of the tool 100 and the torque wrench 1000 were used together, the

controller 900 provides an error reducing function to assist in preventing hoses/pipes from being twisted
and/or couplings/connections misaligned, which could cause rework or increased warranty costs.
            As used herein, the term "coupled" and its functional equivalents are not intended to necessarily be
limited to direct, mechanical coupling of two or more components. Instead, the term "coupled" and its
functional equivalents are intended to mean any direct or indirect mechanical, electrical, or chemical
connection between two or more objects, features, work pieces, and/or environmental matter. "Coupled" is
also intended to mean, in some examples, one object being integral with another object.
            The matter set forth in the foregoing description and accompanying drawings is offered by way of

THE CLAIMS DEFINING THE INVENTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1.        A tool comprising:
          a housing having first and second ends;
          a handle coupled to the second end;
          a head extending from the first end; and
          an interface module coupled to the housing between the first and second ends, wherein the interface
module includes a switch adapted to activate and cause transmission of a signal when force is applied to the
handle in a direction of the head.
2.        The tool of claim 1, further comprising a transducer beam disposed in the housing and coupled to the
head.
3.        The tool of claim 2, further comprising a torque block disposed in the housing and coupled to the
transducer beam.
4.        The tool of claim 3, further comprising a spring disposed in the housing and around the torque block.
5.        The tool of claim 4, wherein the force applied to the handle causes movement of the handle and
housing with respect to the transducer beam and the torque block and against a bias force of the spring, and
wherein the movement activates the switch.
6.        The tool of claim 1, wherein the interface module includes an indicator adapted to activate when the
switch is activated.
7.        A method, comprising:
          transmitting, by a tool engaged with a first portion of an item, a first signal indicating that the tool is in
use in response to a thrust force being applied to the tool in a direction towards the first portion of the item;
          receiving, by a controller, the first signal; and
          determining, by the controller, whether the tool was in use during application of torque to a second
portion of the item by a torque application tool.
8.        The method of claim 7, further comprising pairing the tool with the torque application tool prior to
application of the torque.
9.        The method of claim 7, further comprising receiving, by the controller, a second signal from the
torque application tool indicating an amount of torque applied by the torque application tool.

10.       The method of claim 9, wherein the step of determining whether the tool was in use includes
receiving, by the controller, the first signal prior to, during, and after the application of the torque by the
torque application tool.
11.       A system for error reducing an application of torque, comprising:
          a processor; and
          a memory storing instructions to be executed by the processor, to cause the processor to:
                     receive a first signal from a tool engaged with a first portion of an item, wherein the first signal
indicates that the tool is in use and the first signal is received in response to a thrust force being applied to
the tool in a direction towards the first portion of the item; and
                     determine that the tool was in use during application of the torque to a second portion of the
item by a torque application tool.
12.       The system of claim 11, wherein the processor is configured to pair the tool with the torque
application tool prior to application of the torque.
13.       The system of claim 11, wherein the processor is configured to receive a second signal from the torque
application tool indicating an amount of the torque applied by the torque application tool.
14.       The system of claim 13, wherein the processor is configured to determine that the tool was in use by
receiving the first signal prior to, during, and after the application of the torque by the torque application
tool.
