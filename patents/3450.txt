Provisional Patent Application No. 61/844,804, filed July 10, 2013, which applications
are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties for all purposes.
                          BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002] The detection and quantification of analytes is important for molecular biology
and medical applications such as diagnostics. Genetic testing is particularly useful for a
number of diagnostic methods. For example, disorders that are caused by mutations,
such as cancer, may be detected or more accurately characterized with DNA sequence
information.
[00031 Appropriate sample preparation is often needed prior to conducting a molecular
reaction such as a sequencing reaction. A starting sample may be a biological sample such
as a collection of cells, tissue, or nucleic acids. When the starting material is cells or
tissue, the sample may need to be lysed or otherwise manipulated in order to permit the
extraction of molecules such as DNA. Sample preparation may also involve fragmenting
molecules, isolating molecules, and/or attaching unique identifiers to particular fragments
of molecules, among other actions. There is a need in the art for improved methods and
devices for preparing samples prior to downstream applications.
                              SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0004]   This disclosure provides compositions and methods for a microcapsule array
device.
[0005] An aspect of the disclosure provides a composition comprising a first
microcapsule, wherein: the first microcapsule is degradable upon the application of a
stimulus to the first microcapsule; and the first microcapsule comprises an
oligonucleotide barcode.      In some cases, the first microcapsule may comprise a chemical
cross-linker. The chemical cross-linker, for example, may be a disulfide bond. In some
cases, the composition may comprise a polymer gel, such as, for example a
                                                -1-

WO 2014/028537                                                             PCT/US2013/054797
polyacrylamide gel. The first microcapsule may comprise a bead. In some cases, the
bead may be a gel bead.
[0006] Moreover, the stimulus may be selected from the group consisting of a biological,
chemical, thermal, electrical, magnetic, or photo stimulus, and combination thereof. In
some cases, the chemical stimulus may be selected from the group consisting of a change
in pH, a change in ion concentration, and a reducing agent. The reducing agent may be,
for example, dithiothreitol (DTT) or tris(2-carboxyethyl)
phosphine (TCEP).
[0007] A second microcapsule may comprise the first microcapsule. Moreover, the
second microcapsule may be a droplet.       In some cases, the composition may also
comprise a nucleic acid that comprises the oligonucleotide barcode, wherein the nucleic
acid comprises a deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP). In some cases, the composition may
comprise a polymerase unable to accept a deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP). Also, the
composition may comprise a target analyte, such as, for example, a nucleic acid.        The
nucleic acid may be selected from the group consisting of DNA, RNA, dNTPs, ddNTPs,
amplicons, synthetic nucleotides, synthetic polynucleotides, polynucleotides,
oligonucleotides, peptide nucleic acids, cDNA, dsDNA, ssDNA, plasmid DNA, cosmid
DNA, High Molecular Weight (MW) DNA, chromosomal DNA, genomic DNA, viral
DNA, bacterial DNA, mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA), mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, nRNA,
siRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, scaRNA, microRNA, dsRNA, ribozyme, riboswitch and viral
RNA. In some cases, the nucleic acid may be genomic DNA (gDNA).
[0008] Additionally, the density of the oligonucleotide barcodes may be at least about
1,000,000 oligonucleotide barcodes per the first microcapsule. The oligonucleotide
barcode may be coupled to the microcapsule via a chemical cross-linker, such as, for
example a disulfide bond.
[0009] An additional aspect of the disclosure comprises a device comprising a plurality of
partitions, wherein: at least one partition of the plurality of partitions comprises a
microcapsule comprising an oligonucleotide barcode; and the microcapsule is degradable
upon the application of a stimulus to the microcapsule. The partition, for example, may
be a well or a droplet. In some cases, the microcapsule comprises a chemical cross-linker
such as, for example, a disulfide bond. Moreover, the microcapsule may comprise a
polymer gel such as, for example, a polyacrylamide gel.        Also, the microcapsule may
comprise a bead. In some cases, the bead may be a gel bead.
                                               -2-

WO 2014/028537                                                          PCT/US2013/054797
[0010] The stimulus may be selected from the group consisting of a biological, chemical,
thermal, electrical, magnetic, or photo stimulus, and a combination thereof. In some
cases, the chemical stimulus may be selected from the group consisting of a change in pH,
change in ion concentration, and a reducing agent. The reducing agent, for example, may
be dithiothreitol (DTT) or tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP).
[0011] Furthermore, a nucleic acid may comprise the oligonucleotide barcode and the
nucleic acid may comprise a deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP).       In some cases, the
partition may comprise a polymerase unable to accept a deoxyuridine triphosphate
(dUTP).    Additionally, the partition may comprise a target analyte such as, for example, a
nucleic acid. The nucleic acid may be selected from the group consisting of DNA, RNA,
dNTPs, ddNTPs, amplicons, synthetic nucleotides, synthetic polynucleotides,
polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, peptide nucleic acids, cDNA, dsDNA, ssDNA, plasmid
DNA, cosmid DNA, High Molecular Weight (MW) DNA, chromosomal DNA, genomic
DNA, viral DNA, bacterial DNA, mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA), mRNA, rRNA, tRNA,
nRNA, siRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, scaRNA, microRNA, dsRNA, ribozyme, riboswitch
and viral RNA. In some cases, the nucleic acid may be genomic DNA (gDNA). The
oligonucleotide barcode may be coupled to the microcapsule via a chemical cross-linker.
In some cases, the chemical cross-linker may be a disulfide bond.
[0012] A further aspect of the disclosure provides a method for sample preparation
comprising combining a microcapsule comprising an oligonucleotide barcode and a target
analyte into a partition, wherein the microcapsule is degradable upon the application of a
stimulus to the microcapsule; and applying the stimulus to the microcapsule to release the
oligonucleotide barcode to the target analyte. The partition may be, for example, a well
or a droplet. In some cases, the microcapsule may comprise a polymer gel such as, for
example, a polyacrylamide.     Moreover, the microcapsule may comprise a bead. In some
cases, the bead may be a gel bead. Moreover, the microcapsule may comprise a chemical
cross-linker such as, for example, a disulfide bond.
[0013] The stimulus may be selected from the group consisting of a biological, chemical,
thermal, electrical, magnetic, photo stimulus, and a combination thereof. In some cases,
the chemical stimulus may be selected from the group consisting of a change in pH,
change in ion concentration, and a reducing agent. The reducing agent may be, for
example, dithiothreitol (DTT) or tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP).
                                             -3-

WO 2014/028537                                                           PCT/US2013/054797
[0014] Also, a nucleic acid may comprise the oligonucleotide barcode and the nucleic
acid may comprise a deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP). In some cases, the partition may
comprise a polymerase unable to accept a deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP). Moreover,
the method may also comprise attaching the oligonucleotide barcode to the target analyte.
The attaching may be completed, for example, with a nucleic acid amplification reaction.
Moreover, the analyte may be a nucleic acid. In some cases, the nucleic acid may be
selected from the group consisting of DNA, RNA, dNTPs, ddNTPs, amplicons, synthetic
nucleotides, synthetic polynucleotides, polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, peptide nucleic
acids, cDNA, dsDNA, ssDNA, plasmid DNA, cosmid DNA, High Molecular Weight
(MW) DNA, chromosomal DNA, genomic DNA, viral DNA, bacterial DNA, mtDNA
(mitochondrial DNA), mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, nRNA, siRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, scaRNA,
microRNA, dsRNA, ribozyme, riboswitch and viral RNA. In some cases, the nucleic
acid may be genomic DNA (gDNA).         Furthermore, the oligonucleotide barcode may be
coupled to the microcapsule via a chemical cross-linker. In some cases, the chemical
cross-linker may be a disulfide bond.
[0015] A further aspect of the disclosure provides a composition comprising a degradable
gel bead, wherein the gel bead comprises at least about 1,000,000 oligonucleotide
barcodes. In some cases, the 1,000,000 oligonucleotide barcodes are identical.

                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0025] While various embodiments of the invention have been shown and described
herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by
way of example only. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions may occur to
those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. It should be understood that
various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be
employed.
I. General Overview
[0026] The present disclosure provides microwell or other partition capsule array devices
and methods of using such devices. Generally, the device is an assembly of partitions
(e.g., microwells, droplets) that are loaded with microcapsules, often at a particular
concentration of microcapsules per partition.
[0027] The devices may be particularly useful to perform sample preparation operations.
In some cases, a device subdivides a sample (e.g., a heterogeneous mixture of nucleic
acids, a mixture of cells, etc.) into multiple partitions such that only a portion of the
sample is present in each partition. For example, a nucleic acid sample comprising a
mixture of nucleic acids may be partitioned such that no more than one strand of (or
molecule of) nucleic acid is present in each partition. In other examples, a cell sample
may be partitioned such that no more than one cell is present in each partition.
[0028] Following the partitioning step, any of a number of different operations may be
performed on the subdivided sample within the device. The partitions may include one or
more capsules that contain one or more reagents (e.g., enzymes, unique identifiers (e.g.,
bar codes), antibodies, etc.). In some cases, the device, a companion device or a user
                                               -5-

WO 2014/028537                                                            PCT/US2013/054797
provides a trigger that causes the microcapsules to release one or more of the reagents
into the respective partition. The release of the reagent may enable contact of the reagent
with the subdivided sample. For example, if the reagent is a unique identifier such as a
barcode, the sample may be tagged with the unique identifier. The tagged sample may
then be used in a downstream application such as a sequencing reaction.
[0029] A variety of different reactions and/operations may occur within a device
disclosed herein, including but not limited to: sample partitioning, sample isolation,
binding reactions, fragmentation (e.g., prior to partitioning or following partitioning),
ligation reactions, and other enzymatic reactions.
The device also may be useful for a variety of different molecular biology applications
including, but not limited to, nucleic acid sequencing, protein sequencing, nucleic acid
quantification, sequencing optimization, detecting gene expression, quantifying gene
expression, and single-cell analysis of genomic or expressed markers. Moreover, the
device has numerous medical applications. For example, it may be used for the
identification, detection, diagnosis, treatment, staging of, or risk prediction of various
genetic and non-genetic diseases and disorders including cancer.
II. Microcapsules
[0030] Figure 1A is a schematic of an exemplary microcapsule comprising an internal
compartment 120 enveloped by a second layer 130, which is encapsulated by a solid or
semi-permeable shell or membrane 110. In general, the shell separates the internal
compartment(s) from their immediate environment (e.g., interior of a microwell). The
internal compartments, e.g., 120, 130, may comprise materials such as reagents. As
depicted in Figure 1A, the reagents 100 may be present in the internal compartment 120.
However, in some cases, the reagents are located in the enveloping layer 130 or in both
compartments. Generally, the microcapsule may release the inner materials, or a portion
thereof, following the introduction of a particular trigger. The trigger may cause
disruption of the shell layer 110 and/or the internal enveloping layer 130, thereby
permitting contact of the internal compartment 100, 120 with the outside environment,
such as the cavity of a microwell.
[0031] The microcapsule may comprise several fluidic phases and may comprise an
emulsion (e.g. water-in-oil emulsion, oil-in-water emulsion). A microcapsule may
comprise an internal layer 120 that is immiscible with a second layer 130 enveloping the
internal layer. For example, the internal layer 120 may comprise an aqueous fluid, while
                                              -6-

WO 2014/028537                                                               PCT/US2013/054797
the enveloping layer 130 may be a non-aqueous fluid such as an oil. Conversely, the
internal layer 120 may comprise a non-aqueous fluid (e.g., oil), and the enveloping layer
130 may comprise an aqueous fluid. In some cases, the microcapsule does not comprise
an enveloping second layer. Often, the microcapsule is further encapsulated by a shell
layer 110, which may comprise a polymeric material. In some cases, a microcapsule may
comprise a droplet. In some cases, a microcapsule may be a droplet.
[0032] Droplets and methods for droplet generation, for example, are described in U.S.
Patent No. RE41,780, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all
purposes. The device also may contain a microfluidic element that enables the flow of a
sample and/or microcapsules through the device and distribution of the sample and/or
microcapsules within the partitions.
[0033] The microcapsule can comprise multiple compartments. The microcapsule may
comprise at least 1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 50, 100,
500, 1000, 1500,2000,2500,3000,3500,4000,4500,5000,5500,6000,6500,7000,
7500, 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10000, or 50000 compartments. In other cases, the
microcapsule comprises less than 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20,50, 100,500, 1000, 1500,2000,2500,3000,3500,4000,4500,5000,5500,6000,
6500, 7000, 7500, 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10000, or 50000 compartments. Similarly,
each compartment, or a subset thereof, may also be subdivided into a plurality of
additional compartments. In some cases, each compartment, or subset thereof, is
subdivided into at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
50, 100,500, 1000, 1500,2000,2500,3000,3500,4000,4500,5000,5500,6000,6500,
7000, 7500, 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10000, or 50000 compartments. In other cases, each
compartment, or subset thereof, is further subdivided into less than 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,50,100,500,1000,1500,2000,2500,3000,3500,
4000,4500,5000,5500,6000,6500,7000,7500,8000,8500,9000,9500, 10000,or
50000 compartments.
[0034] There are several possible distributions of reagent in the multiple compartments.
For example, each compartment (or some percentage of the total number of
compartments) may comprise the same reagent or the same combination or reagents. In
some cases, each compartment (or some percentage of the total number of compartments)
comprises different reagents or a different combination of reagents.
                                                 -7-

WO 2014/028537                                                           PCT/US2013/054797
[0035] The compartments may be configured in a variety of ways. In some cases, the
microcapsule may comprise multiple concentric compartments (repeating units of
compartments that contain the preceding compartment), often separated by an immiscible
layer. In such microcapsules, the reagents may be present in alternating compartments, in
every third compartment, or in every fourth compartment.
[0036] In some cases, most of the compartments with a microcapsule are not concentric;
instead, they exist as separate, self-contained entities within a microcapsule. Figure 1B
depicts an example of a microcapsule that contains a plurality of smaller microcapsules
140, each containing a reagent. Like many of the other microcapsules described herein,
the microcapsule may be encapsulated by an outer shell, often comprising a polymer
material 150. The plurality of smaller microcapsules encapsulated within the larger
microcapsule may be physically separated by an immiscible fluid 160, thereby preventing
mixing of reagents before application of a stimulus and release of reagents into solution.
In some cases, the immiscible fluid is loaded with additional materials or reagents. In
some cases, the plurality of smaller microcapsules are surrounded by a layer of
immiscible fluid (e.g., 170) which is further surrounded by a fluid 160 that is miscible
with the inner fluid of the microcapsules. For example, the interior microcapsules 180
may comprise an aqueous interior enveloped by an immiscible (e.g., oil) layer, that is
further surrounded by an aqueous layer 160. The miscible compartments (e.g., 160 and
180) may each contain reagents. They may contain the same reagents (or the same
combination of reagents) or different reagents (or different combination of reagents).
Alternatively, one or some of the miscible compartments may comprise no reagents.
[0037] The microcapsule may comprise a polymeric shell (see, e.g., Figures 1 and 2) or
multiple polymeric shells. For example, the microcapsule may comprise multiple
polymeric shells layered on top of each other. In other cases, individual compartments
within a microcapsule comprise a polymeric shell, or a subset of the compartments may
comprise a polymeric shell. For example, all or some of the smaller compartments 140
in Figure 1B may comprise a polymeric shell that separates them from the fluidic interior
160. The microcapsule may be designed so that a particular reagent is contained within a
compartment that has a polymerized shell, while a different reagent is within a
compartment that is simply enveloped by an immiscible liquid. For example, a reagent
that is desired to be released upon a heat trigger may be contained within the
compartments that have a heat-sensitive or heat-activatable polymerized shell, while
                                               -8-

WO 2014/028537                                                            PCT/US2013/054797
reagents designed to be released upon a different trigger may be present in different types
of compartments. In another example, paramagnetic particles may be incorporated into
the capsule shell wall. A magnet or electric field may then be used to position the capsule
to a desired location. In some cases, a magnetic field (e.g., high frequency alternating
magnetic field) can be applied to such capsules; the incorporated paramagnetic particles
may then transform the energy of the magnetic field into heat, thereby triggering rupture
of the capsule.
[0038] The microcapsule component of a device of this disclosure may provide for the
controlled and/or timed release of reagents for sample preparation of an analyte.
Microcapsules may be used in particular for controlled release and transport of varying
types of chemicals, ingredients, pharmaceuticals, fragrances etc..., including particularly
sensitive reagents such as enzymes and proteins (see, e.g., D. D. Lewis, "Biodegradable
Polymers and Drug Delivery Systems", M. Chasin and R. Langer, editors (Marcel Decker,
New York, 1990); J. P. McGee et al., J. Control. Release 34 (1995), 77).
[0039] Microcapsules may also provide a means for delivery of reagents in discrete and
definable amounts. Microcapsules may be used to prevent premature mixing of reagents
with the sample, by segregating the reagents from the sample. Microcapsules also may
ease handling of - and limit contacts with-- particularly sensitive reagents such as
enzymes, nucleic acids and other chemicals used in sample preparation.
        A.      Preparation of Microcapsules
[0040] Microcapsules of a device of this disclosure may be prepared by numerous
methods and processes. Preparative techniques may include pan coating, spray drying,
centrifugal extrusion, emulsion-based methods, and/or microfluidic techniques. Typically,
a method for preparation is chosen based on the desired characteristics of the
microcapsule. For example, shell wall thickness, permeability, chemical composition of
the shell wall, mechanical integrity of the shell wall and capsule size may be taken into
consideration when choosing a method. Methods of preparation may also be selected
based on the ability to incorporate specific materials within the capsule such as whether
the core materials (e.g., fluids, reagents, etc.) are aqueous, organic or inorganic.
Additionally, preparation methods can affect the shape and size of the microcapsule. For
example a capsule's shape, (e.g., spherical, ellipsoidal, etc.), may depend on the shape of
the droplet in the precursor liquid which may be determined by the viscosity and surface

WO 2014/028537                                                            PCT/US2013/054797
in droplet stabilization, as well as physical confinement such as preparations made in a
microchannel or capillary of a particular size (e.g., a size requiring distortion of the
microcapsule in order for the microcapsule to fit within the microchannel or capillary.
[0041] Microcapsules may be prepared through emulsification polymerization, a process
in which monomer units at an aqueous/organic interface in an emulsion polymerize to
form a shell. Reagents are mixed with the aqueous phase of the biphasic mixture.
Vigorous shaking, or sonication of the mixture, creates droplets containing reagents,
which are encased by a polymeric shell.
[0042] In some cases, microcapsules may be prepared through layer-by-layer assembly, a
process in which negatively and positively charged polyelectrolytes are deposited onto
particles such as metal oxide cores. Electrostatic interactions between polyelectrolytes
create a polymeric shell around the core. The core can be subsequently removed via
addition of acid, resulting in a semi-permeable hollow sphere which can be loaded with
various reagents.
[0043] In still further cases, microcapsules may be prepared through coacervation, a
process in which two oppositely charged polymers in aqueous solution become entangled
to form a neutralized polymer shell wall. One polymer may be contained within an oil
phase, while the other, of opposite charge is contained in an aqueous phase. This aqueous
phase may contain reagents to be encapsulated. The attraction of one polymer for another
can result in the formation of coascervates. In some embodiments, gelatin and gum
Arabic are components of this preparative method.
[0044] Microcapsules also may be prepared through internal phase separation, a process
in which a polymer is dissolved in a solvent mixture containing volatile and nonvolatile
solvents. Droplets of the resultant solution are suspended in an aqueous layer, which is
stabilized by continual agitation and the use of surfactants. This phase may contain
reagents to be encapsulated. When the volatile solvent evaporates, the polymers coalesce
to form a shell wall. In some cases, polymers such as polystyrene, poly(methyl
methacrylate) and poly(tetrahydrofuran) are used to form shell walls.
[0045] Microcapsules also may be prepared through flow focusing methods, a process in
which a microcapillary device is used to generate double emulsions containing a single
internal droplet encased in a middle fluid which is then dispersed to an outer fluid. The
inner droplet may contain reagents to be encapsulated. The middle fluid becomes the shell
wall, which can be formed via cross-linking reactions.

WO 2014/028537                                                           PCT/US2013/054797
        B.      Microcapsule Composition
[0046] Microcapsules may comprise a variety of materials with a wide range of chemical
characteristics. Generally, the microcapsules comprise materials with the ability to form
microcapsules of a desired shape and size and that are compatible with the reagents to be
stored in the microcapsules.
[0047] Microcapsules may comprise a wide range of different polymers including but not
limited to: polymers, heat sensitive polymers, photosensitive polymers, magnetic
polymers, pH sensitive polymers, salt-sensitive polymers, chemically sensitive polymers,
polyelectrolytes, polysaccharides, peptides, proteins, and/or plastics. Polymers may
include but are not limited to materials such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAAm), poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS), poly(allyl amine) (PAAm), poly(acrylic acid)
(PAA), poly(ethylene imine) (PEI), poly(diallyldimethyl-ammonium chloride)
(PDADMAC), poly(pyrolle) (PPy), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVPON), poly(vinyl
pyridine) (PVP), poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),
polystyrene (PS), poly(tetrahydrofuran) (PTHF), poly(phthaladehyde) (PTHF),
poly(hexyl viologen) (PHV), poly(L-lysine) (PLL), poly(L-arginine) (PARG), poly(lactic
co-glycolic acid) (PLGA).
[0048] Often, materials for the microcapsules, particularly the shells of microcapsules,
may enable the microcapsule to be disrupted with an applied stimulus. For example, a
microcapsule may be prepared from heat sensitive polymers and/or may comprise one or
more shells comprising such heat-sensitive polymers. The heat-sensitive polymer may be
stable under conditions used for storage or loading. Upon exposure to heat, the heat
sensitive polymer components may undergo depolymerization, resulting in disruption to
the integrity of the shell and release of the inner materials of the microcapsule (and/or of
the inner microcapsules) to the outside environment (e.g., the interior of a microwell).
Exemplary heat-sensitive polymers may include, but are not limited to NIPAAm or
PNIPAM hydrogel. The microcapsules may also comprise one or more types of oil.
Exemplary oils include but are not limited to hydrocarbon oils, fluorinated oils,
fluorocarbon oils, silicone oils, mineral oils, vegetable oils, and any other suitable oil.
[0049] The microcapsules may also comprise a surfactant, such as an emulsifying
surfactant. Exemplary surfactants include, but are not limited to, cationic surfactants, non
ionic surfactants, anionic surfactants, hydrocarbon surfactants or fluorosurfactants. The
                                               -11-

WO 2014/028537                                                             PCT/US2013/054797
surfactant may increase the stability of one or more components of the microcapsule, such
as an inner compartment that comprises an oil.
[0050] Additionally, the microcapsules may comprise an inner material that is miscible
with materials external to the capsule. For example, the inner material may be an aqueous
fluid and the sample within the microwell may also be in an aqueous fluid. In other
examples, the microcapsule may comprise powders or nanoparticles that are miscible with
an aqueous fluid. For example, the microcapsule may comprise such powders or
nanoparticles in an inner compartment. Upon disruption of the microcapsule, such
powders or nanoparticles are released into the external environment (e.g., interior of
microwell) and may mix with an aqueous fluid (e.g., an aqueous sample fluid).
[0051] Additionally, the microcapsule may comprise a material that is immiscible with
the surrounding environment (e.g., interior of microwell, sample fluid). In such cases,
when the inner emulsion is released to the surrounding environment, the phase separation
between the inner and outer components may promote mixing, such as mixing of the
inner components with the surrounding fluid. In some cases, when a microcapsule is
triggered to release its contents, a pressure or force is also released that promotes mixing
of internal and external components.
[0052]   The microcapsules may also comprise a polymer within the interior of the
capsule. In some instances this polymer may be a porous polymer bead that may entrap
reagents or combinations of reagents. In other instances, this polymer may be a bead that
has been previously swollen to create a gel. Examples of polymer based gels that may be
used as inner emulsions of capsules may include, but are not limited to sodium alginate
gel, or poly acrylamide gel swelled with oligonucleotide bar codes or the like.
[0053] In some cases, a microcapsule may be a gel bead comprising any of the polymer
based gels described herein. Gel bead microcapsules may be generated, for example, by
encapsulating one or more polymeric precursors into droplets. Upon exposure of the
polymeric precursors to an accelerator (e.g., tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED)), a gel
bead may be generated.
[0054] Analytes and/or reagents, such as oligonucleotide barcodes, for example, may be
coupled/immobilized to the interior surface of a gel bead (e.g., the interior accessible via
diffusion of an oligonucleotide barcode and/or materials used to generate an
oligonucleotide barcode) and/or the outer surface of a gel bead or any other microcapsule
described herein. Coupling/immobilization may be via any form of chemical bonding
                                              -12-

WO 2014/028537                                                           PCT/US2013/054797
(e.g., covalent bond, ionic bond) or physical phenomena (e.g., Van der Waals forces,
dipole-dipole interactions, etc.). In some cases, coupling/immobilization of a reagent to a
gel bead or any other microcapsule described herein may be reversible, such as, for
example, via a labile moiety (e.g., via a chemical cross-linker, including chemical cross
linkers described herein). Upon application of a stimulus, the labile moiety may be
cleaved and the immobilized reagent set free. In some cases, the labile moiety is a
disulfide bond. For example, in the case where an oligonucleotide barcode is
immobilized to a gel bead via a disulfide bond, exposure of the disulfide bond to a
reducing agent can cleave the disulfide bond and free the oligonucleotide barcode from
the bead. The labile moiety may be included as part of a gel bead or microcapsule, as
part of a chemical linker that links a reagent or analyte to a gel bead or microcapsule,
and/or as part of a reagent or analyte.
[0055] A gel bead or any other type of microcapsule described herein may contain varied
numbers of reagents. The density of a reagent per microcapsule may vary depending on
the particular microcapsule utilized and the particular reagent. For example, a
microcapsule or gel bead may comprise at least about 1; 10; 100; 1,000; 10,000; 100,000;
1,000,000; 5,000,000; 10,000,000, 50,000,000; 100,000,000; 500,000,000; or
1,000,000,000 oligonucleotide barcodes per microcapsule or gel bead. A gel bead may
comprise identical oligonucleotide barcodes or may comprise differing oligonucleotide
barcodes.
[0056] In other example, the microcapsule may comprise one or more materials that
create a net neutral, negative or positive charge on the outer shell wall of the capsule. In
some instances, the charge of a capsule may aid in preventing or promoting aggregation
or clustering of particles, or adherence or repulsion to parts of the device.
[0057] In addition, the microcapsule may comprise one or more materials that cause the
outer shell wall of the capsule to be hydrophilic or hydrophobic. A hydrophilic material
that may be used for capsule shell walls may be poly(N-isopropylacrylamide). A
hydrophobic material that may be used for capsule shell walls may be polystyrene. In
certain instances, a hydrophilic shell wall may aid in wicking of the capsule into wells
comprising aqueous fluid.
        C.      Microcapsule Size and Shape
[0058] A microcapsule may be any of a number of sizes or shapes. In some cases, the
shape of the microcapsule may be spherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical, hexagonal or any
                                              -13-

WO 2014/028537                                                               PCT/US2013/054797
other symmetrical or non-symmetrical shape. Any cross-section of the microcapsule may
also be of any appropriate shape, include but not limited to: circular, oblong, square,
rectangular, hexagonal, or other symmetrical or non-symmetrical shape. In some cases,
the microcapsule may be of a specific shape that complements an opening (e.g., surface of
a microwell) of the device. For example, the microcapsule may be spherical and the
opening of a microwell of the device may be circular.
[0059] The microcapsules may be of uniform size (e.g., all of the microcapsules are the
same size) or heterogeneous size (e.g., some of the microcapsules are of different sizes).
A dimension (e.g., diameter, cross-section, side, etc.) of a microcapsule may be at least
about 0.001 gm, .01 gm, 0.1 gm, 0.5 gm, 1 gm, 5 gm, 10 gm, 50 gm, 100 gm, 200 gm,
300 gm, 400 gm, 500 gm, 600 gm, 700 gm, 800 gm, 900 gm or 1 nm. In some cases, the
microcapsule comprises a microwell that is at most about 0.001 gm, .01 gm, 0.1 gm, 0.5
gm, 1 gm, 5 gm, 10 gm, 50 gm, 100 gm, 200 gm, 300 gm, 400 gm, 500 gm, 600 gm,
700 gm, 800 gm, 900 gm or 1 nm.
[0060] In some cases, microcapsules are of a size and/or shape so as to allow a limited
number of microcapsules to be deposited in individual partitions (e.g., microwells,
droplets) of the microcapsule array. Microcapsules may have a specific size and/or shape
such that exactly or no more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 capsules fit into an
individual microwell; in some cases, on average 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 capsules fit
into an individual microwell. In still further cases, at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 100,
500, or 1000 capsules fit into an individual microwell.
        D.      Reagents and Reagent Loading
[0061] The devices provided herein may comprise free reagents and/or reagents
encapsulated into microcapsules. The reagents may be a variety of molecules, chemicals,
particles, and elements suitable for sample preparation reactions of an analyte. For
example, a microcapsule used in a sample preparation reaction for DNA sequencing of a
target may comprise one or more of the following reagents: enzymes, restriction enzymes
(e.g., multiple cutters), ligase, polymerase (e.g., polymerases that do and do not recognize
dUTPs and/or uracil), fluorophores, oligonucleotide barcodes, buffers, deoxynucleotide
triphosphates (dNTPs) (e.g.deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP), deoxycitidine
triphosphate (dCTP), deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), deoxythymidine triphosphate
(dTTP), deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP)), deoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) and
the like. In another example, a microcapsule used in a sample preparation reaction for

WO 2014/028537                                                             PCT/US2013/054797
single cell analysis may comprise reagents such as one or more of the following reagents:
lysis buffer, detergent, fluorophores, oligonucleotide barcodes, ligase, proteases, heat
activatable proteases, protease or nuclease inhibitors, buffer, enzymes, antibodies,
nanoparticles, and the like.
[00621 Exemplary reagents include, but are not limited to: buffers, acidic solution, basic
solution, temperature-sensitive enzymes, pH-sensitive enzymes, light-sensitive enzymes,
metals, metal ions, magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, manganese, aqueous buffer,
mild buffer, ionic buffer, inhibitor, enzyme, protein, nucleic acid, antibodies, saccharides,
lipid, oil, salt, ion, detergents, ionic detergents, non-ionic detergents, oligonucleotides,
nucleotides, dNTPs, ddNTPs, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA),
peptide nucleic acids, circular DNA (cDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), single
stranded DNA (ssDNA), plasmid DNA, cosmid DNA, chromosomal DNA, genomic
DNA (gDNA), viral DNA, bacterial DNA, mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA), messenger
RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), nRNA, short-interfering
RNA (siRNA), small nuclear RNA (snRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), small
Cajul body specific RNA, (scaRNA), microRNA, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA),
ribozyme, riboswitch and viral RNA, polymerase (e.g., polymerases that do and do not
recognize dUTPs and/or uracil), ligase, restriction enzymes, proteases, nucleases, protease
inhibitors, nuclease inhibitors, chelating agents, reducing agents (e.g., dithiotheritol
(DTT), 2- tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP)), oxidizing agents, fluorophores,
probes, chromophores, dyes, organics, emulsifiers, surfactants, stabilizers, polymers,
water, small molecules, pharmaceuticals, radioactive molecules, preservatives, antibiotics,
aptamers, and pharmaceutical drug compounds.
[0063] In some cases, a microcapsule comprises a set of reagents that have a similar
attribute (e.g., a set of enzymes, a set of minerals, a set of oligonucleotides, a mixture of
different bar-codes, a mixture of identical bar-codes). In other cases, a microcapsule
comprises a heterogeneous mixture of reagents. In some cases, the heterogeneous mixture
of reagents comprises all components necessary to perform a reaction. In some cases,
such mixture comprises all components necessary to perform a reaction, except for 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, or more components necessary to perform a reaction. In some cases, such additional
components are contained within a different microcapsule or within a solution within a
partition (e.g., microwell) of the device.

WO 2014/028537                                                           PCT/US2013/054797
[0064] Reagents may be pre-loaded into the device (e.g., prior to introduction of analyte)
or post-loaded into the device. They may be loaded directly into the device; or, in some
cases, the reagents are encapsulated into a microcapsule that is loaded into the device. In
some cases, only microcapsules comprising reagents are introduced. In other cases, both
free reagents and reagents encapsulated in microcapsules are loaded into the device, either
sequentially or concurrently. In some cases, reagents are introduced to the device either
before or after a particular step. For example, a lysis buffer reagent may be introduced to
the device following partitioning of a cellular sample into multiple partitions (e.g.,
microwells, droplets) within the device. In some cases, reagents and/or microcapsules
comprising reagents are introduced sequentially such that different reactions or operations
occur at different steps. The reagents (or microcapsules) may be also be loaded at steps
interspersed with a reaction or operation step. For example, microcapsules comprising
reagents for fragmenting molecules (e.g., nucleic acids) may be loaded into the device,
followed by a fragmentation step, which may be followed by loading of microcapsules
comprising reagents for ligating bar-codes (or other unique identifiers, e.g., antibodies)
and subsequent ligation of the bar-codes to the fragmented molecules. Additional methods
of loading reagents are described further herein in other sections.
        E.      Molecular 'Barcodes'
[0065] It may be desirable to retain the option of identifying and tracking individual
molecules or analytes after or during sample preparation. In some cases, one or more
unique molecular identifiers, sometimes known in the art as a 'molecular barcodes,' are
used as sample preparation reagents. These molecules may comprise a variety of
different forms such as oligonucleotide bar codes, antibodies or antibody fragments,
fluorophores, nanoparticles, and other elements or combinations thereof. Depending
upon the specific application, molecular barcodes may reversibly or irreversibly bind to
the target analyte and allow for identification and/or quantification of individual analytes
after recovery from a device after sample preparation.
[0066] A device of this disclosure may be applicable to nucleic acid sequencing, protein
detection, single molecule analysis and other methods that require a) precise measurement
of the presence and amount of a specific analyte b) multiplex reactions in which multiple
analytes are pooled for analysis. A device of this disclosure may utilize the microwells of
the microwell array or other type of partition (e.g., droplets) to physically partition target
analytes. This physical partitioning allows for individual analytes to acquire one or more
                                              -16-

WO 2014/028537                                                            PCT/US2013/054797
molecular barcodes. After sample preparation, individual analytes may be pooled or
combined and extracted from a device for multiplex analysis. For most applications,
multiplex analysis substantially decreases the cost of analysis as well as increases
through-put of the process, such as in the case of the nucleic acid sequencing. Molecular
barcodes may allow for the identification and quantification of individual molecules even
after pooling of a plurality of analytes. For example, with respect to nucleic acid
sequencing, molecular barcodes may permit the sequencing of individual nucleic acids,
even after the pooling of a plurality of different nucleic acids.
[0067] Oligonucleotide barcodes, in some cases, may be particularly useful in nucleic
acid sequencing. In general, an oligonucleotide barcode may comprise a unique
sequence (e.g., a barcode sequence) that gives the oligonucleotide barcode its identifying
functionality. The unique sequence may be random or non-random. Attachment of the
barcode sequence to a nucleic acid of interest may associate the barcode sequence with
the nucleic acid of interest. The barcode may then be used to identify the nucleic acid of
interest during sequencing, even when other nucleic acids of interest (e.g., comprising
different barcodes) are present. In cases where a nucleic acid of interest is fragmented
prior to sequencing, an attached barcode may be used to identify fragments as belonging
to the nucleic acid of interest during sequencing.
[0068] An oligonucleotide barcode may consist solely of a unique barcode sequence or
may be included as part of an oligonucleotide of longer sequence length. Such an
oligonucleotide may be an adaptor required for a particular sequencing chemistry and/or
method. For example, such adaptors may include, in addition to an oligonucleotide
barcode, immobilization sequence regions necessary to immobilize (e.g., via
hybridization) the adaptor to a solid surface (e.g., solid surfaces in a sequencer flow cell
channel); sequence regions required for the binding of sequencing primers; and/or a
random sequence (e.g., a random N-mer) that may be useful, for example, in random
amplification schemes. An adaptor can be attached to a nucleic acid to be sequenced, for
example, by amplification, ligation, or any other method described herein.
[0069] Moreover, an oligonucleotide barcode, and/or a larger oligonucleotide comprising
an oligonucleotide barcode may comprise natural nucleic acid bases and/or may comprise
non-natural bases. For example, in cases where an oligonucleotide barcode or a larger
oligonucleotide comprising an oligonucleotide barcode is DNA, the oligonucleotide may
                                              -17-

WO 2014/028537                                                                   PCT/US2013/054797
comprise the natural DNA bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine and/or may
comprise non-natural bases such as uracil.
         F.      Microcapsule-Preparation for Microwell Loading
[0070] Following preparation, reagent loaded microcapsules may be loaded into a device
using a variety of methods. Microcapsules, in some instances, may be loaded as 'dry
capsules.' After preparation, capsules may be separated from a liquid phase using various
techniques, including but not limited to differential centrifugation, evaporation of the
liquid phase, chromatography, filtration and the like. 'Dry capsules' may be collected as
a powder or particulate matter and then deposited into microwells of the microwell array.
Loading 'dry capsules' may be a preferred method in instances in which loading of 'wet
capsules,' leads to inefficiencies of loading such as empty wells and poor distribution of
microcapsules across the microwell array.
[0071] Reagent-loaded microcapsules may also be loaded into a device when the
microcapsules are within a liquid phase, and thereby loaded as 'wet capsules.' In some
instances, microcapsules may be suspended in a volatile oil such that the oil can be
removed or evaporated, leaving only the dry capsule in the well. Loading 'wet capsules'
may be a preferred method in some instances in which loading of dry capsules leads to
inefficiencies of loading, such as microcapsule clustering, aggregation and poor
distribution of microcapsules across the microwell array. Additional methods of loading
reagents and microcapsules are described in other sections of this disclosure.
[0072] The microcapsules also may have a particular density. In some cases, the
microcapsules are less dense than an aqueous fluid (e.g., water); in some cases, the
microcapsules are denser than an aqueous fluid (e.g., water). In some cases, the
microcapsules are less dense than a non-aqueous fluid (e.g., oil); in some cases, the
microcapsules are denser than a non-aqueous fluid (e.g., oil). Microcapsules may
comprise a density at least about 0.05 g/cm 3 , 0.1 cm 3 , 0.2 g/ cm 3 , 0.3 g/ cm 3 , 0.4 g/
cm 3, 0.5 g/ cm 3, 0.6 g/ cm 3, 0.7 g/cm 3, 0.8 g/cm 3, 0.81 g/cm 3, 0.82 g/cm 3, 0.83 g/cm 3,
0.84 g/cm 3 , 0.85 g/cm 3 , 0.86 g/cm 3 , 0.87 g/cm 3 , 0.88 g/cm 3 , 0.89 g/cm 3 , 0.90 g/cm 3 , 0.91
g/cm 3 , 0.92 g/cm 3, 0.93 g/cm 3 , 0.94 g/cm 3 , 0.95 g/cm 3 , 0.96 g/cm 3 , 0.97 g/cm 3 , 0.98
g/cm 3 , 0.99 g/cm 3, 1.00 g/cm 3 , 1.05 g/cm 3 , 1.1 g/cm 3 , 1.2 g/cm 3 , 1.3 g/cm 3 , 1.4 g/cm 3 , 1.5
g/cm 3 , 1.6 g/cm 3, 1.7 g/cm 3 , 1.8 g/cm 3 , 1.9 g/cm 3, 2.0 g/cm 3, 2.1 g/cm 3, 2.2 g/cm 3, 2.3
g/cm 3, 2.4 g/cm 3, or 2.5 g/cm 3 . In other cases, microcapsule densities may be at most
about 0.7 g/cm 3, 0.8 g/cm 3, 0.81 g/cm 3, 0.82 g/cm 3, 0.83 g/cm 3, 0.84 g/cm 3 , 0.85 g/cm 3,

III. Microwell Array
         A.       Structure/Features
[0073] A device of this disclosure may be a microwell array comprising a solid plate
containing a plurality of holes, cavities or microwells in which microcapsules and/or
analytes are deposited. Generally, a fluidic sample (or analyte) is introduced into the
device (e.g., through an inlet) and then travels through a flow channel which distributes
the sample into multiple microwells. In some cases, additional fluid is introduced into the
device as well. The microwells may comprise microcapsules when the sample is
introduced; or, in some cases, the microcapsules are introduced into the microwells
following introduction of the sample.
[0074] Figure 2A depicts a prototype microwell array; a sideview is depicted in Figure
2B. The microwell array may include a plate 220 that can be made of any suitable
material commonly used in a chemical laboratory, including fused silica, soda lima glass,
borosilicate glass, PMMA, sapphire, silicon, germanium, cyclic olefin copolymer and
cyclic polymer, polyethylenes, polypropylenes, polyacrylates, polycarbonates, plastics,
Topas, and other suitable substrates known in the art. The plate 220 may initially be a flat
solid plate comprising a regular pattern of microwells 270. The microwells may be
formed by drilling or chemical dissolution or any other suitable method of machining;
however, plates with a desired hole pattern are preferably molded, e.g. by injection
molding, embossing, or using a suitable polymer, such as cyclic olefin copolymer.
[0075] The microwell array may comprise an inlet (200 and 240) and/or an outlet (210
and 260); in some cases, the microwell array comprises multiple inlets and/or outlets. A
sample (or analyte) or microcapsules may be introduced to the device via the inlet.
Solutions containing analytes, reagents and/or microcapsules may be manually applied to
the inlet port 200 and 240 (or to a conduit attached to the inlet port) via a pipette. In some
cases, a liquid handling device is used to introduce analytes, reagents, and/or
microcapsules to the device. Exemplary liquid handling devices may rely on a pipetting
                                                   -19-

WO 2014/028537                                                           PCT/US2013/054797
robot, capillary action, or dipping into a fluid. In some cases, the inlet port is connected
to a reservoir comprising microcapsules or analytes. The inlet port may be attached to a
flow channel 250 that permits distribution of the analyte, sample, or microcapsules to the
microwells in the device. In some cases, the inlet port may be used to introduce to the
device a fluid (e.g., oil, aqueous) that does not contain microcapsules or analyte, such as a
carrier fluid. The carrier fluid may be introduced via the inlet port before, during, or
following the introduction of analyte and/or microcapsules.     In cases where the device
has multiple inlets, the same sample may be introduced via the multiple inlets, or each
inlet may convey a different sample. In some cases, one inlet may convey a sample or
analyte to the microwells, while a different inlet conveys free reagents and/or reagents
encapsulated in microcapsules to the device. The device may have at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, or 10 inlets and/or outlets.
[0076] In some cases, solutions containing microcapsules and/or analytes may be pulled
through the device via a vacuum manifold attached to the outlet port 210 and 260. Such
manifold may apply a negative pressure to the device. In other cases, a positive pressure
is used to move sample, analytes, and/or microcapsules through the device. The area,
length, and width of surfaces of 230 according to this disclosure may be varied according
to the requirements of the assay to be performed. Considerations may include, for
example, ease of handling, limitations of the material(s) of which the surface is formed,
requirements of detection or processing systems, requirements of deposition systems (e.g.
microfluidic systems), and the like. The thickness may comprise a thickness of at least
about 0.001 mm, 0.005 mm, 0.01 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, 0.3 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.5
mm, 0.6 mm, 0.7 mm, 0.8 mm, 0.9 mm, 1.0 mm, 2.0 mm, 3.0 mm, 4.0 mm, 5.0 mm, 6.0
mm, 7.0 mm, 8.0 mm, 9.0 mm, 10.0 mm, 11 mm, 12 mm, 13 mm, 14 mm, or 15 mm. In
other cases, microcapsule thickness may be at most 0.001 mm, 0.005 mm, 0.01 mm, 0.05
mm, 0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, 0.3 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.6 mm, 0.7 mm, 0.8 mm, 0.9 mm, 1.0
mm, 2.0 mm, 3.0 mm, 4.0 mm, 5.0 mm, 6.0 mm, 7.0 mm, 8.0 mm, 9.0 mm, 10.0 mm, 11
mm, 12 mm, 13 mm, 14 mm, or 15 mm.
[0077] The microwells 270 can be any shape and size suitable for the assay performed.
The cross-section of the microwells may have a cross-sectional dimension that is circular,
rectangular, square, hexagonal, or other symmetric or non-symmetric shape. In some
cases, the shape of the microwell may be cylindrical, cubic, conical, frustoconical,
hexagonal or other symmetric or non-symmetric shape. The diameter of the microwells

270 may be determined by the size of the wells desired and the available surface area of
the plate itself. Exemplary microwells comprise diameters of at least 0.01 gm, 0.1 gm, 0.2
gm, 0.3 gm, 0.4 gm, 0.5 gm, 1 gm, 10 gm, 25 gm, 50 gm, 75 gm, 100 gm, 200 gm, 300
gm, 400 gm, 500 gm, 600 gm, 700 gm, 800 gm, 900 gm, 1.0 mm. In other cases,
microwell diameters may comprise at most 0.01 gm, 0.1 gm, 0.2 gm, 0.3 gm, 0.4 gm, 0.5
gm, 1 gm, 10 gm, 25 gm, 50 gm, 75 gm, 100 gm, 200 gm, 300 gm, 400 gm, 500 gm,
600 gm, 700 gm, 800 gm, 900 gm or 1.0 mm.
[0078] The capacity (or volume) of each well can be a measure of the height of the well
(the thickness of the plate) and the effective diameter of each well. The capacity of an
individual well may be selected from a wide range of volumes. In some cases, the device
may comprise a well (or microwell) with a capacity of at least 0.001 fL, .01 fL, 0.1 fL, 0.5
fL, 1 fL, 5 fL, 10 fL, 50 fL, 100 fL, 200 fL, 300 fL, 400 fL, 500 fL, 600 fL, 700 fL, 800
fL, 900 fL, 1 pL, 5 pL, 10 pL, 50 pL, 100 pL, 200 pL, 300 pL, 400 pL, 500 pL, 600 pL,
700 pL, 800 pL, 900 pL, 1 nL, 5 nL, 10 nL, 50 nL, 100 nL, 200 nL, 300 nL, 400 nL, 500
nL, 1 uL, 50 uL, or 100 uL. In other cases, the microcapsule comprises a microwell that
is less than 0.001 fL, .01 fL, 0.1 fL, 0.5 L, 5 fL, 10 fL, 50 fL, 100 fL, 200 fL, 300 fL, 400
fL, 500 fL, 600 fL, 700 fL, 800 fL, 900 fL, 1 pL, 5 pL, 10 pL, 50 pL, 100 pL, 200 pL, 300
pL, 400 pL, 500 pL, 600 pL, 700 pL, 800 pL, 900 pL, 1 nL, 5 nL, 10 nL, 50 nL, 100 nL,
200 nL, 300 nL, 400 nL, 500 nL, 1 uL, 50 uL, or 100 uL.
[0079] There may be variability in the volume of fluid in different microwells in the
array. More specifically, the volume of different microwells may vary by at least (or at
most) plus or minus 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%,
90%, 100%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, or 1000% across a set of microwells. For
example, a microwell may comprise a volume of fluid that is at most 80% of the fluid
volume within a second microwell.
[0080] Based on the dimension of individual microwells and the size of the plate, the
microwell array may comprise a range of well densities. In some examples, a plurality of
microwells may have a density of at least about 2,500 wells/cm2 , at least about 1,000
wells/cm2 . In some cases, the plurality of wells may have a density of at least 10
wells/cm2 . In other cases, the well density may comprise at least 10 wells/cm2 , 50
wells/cm 2, 100 wells/cm2 , 500 wells/cm 2 , 1000 wells/cm 2 , 5000 wells/cm2 , 10000
wells/cm2 , 50000 wells/cm2 , or 100000 wells/cm2 . In other cases, the well density may be
                                               -21-

WO 2014/028537                                                              PCT/US2013/054797
less than 100000 wells/cm 2 , 10000 wells/cm 2 , 5000 wells/cm 2 , 1000 wells/cm 2, 500
wells/cm2 , or 100 wells/cm2
[0081] In some cases, the interior surface of the microwells comprises a hydrophilic
material that preferably accommodates an aqueous sample; in some cases, the region
between the microwells is composed of a hydrophobic material that may preferentially
attract a hydrophobic sealing fluid described herein.
[0082] Multiple microwell arrays, e.g., Figure 2B may be arranged within a single
device. Figure 3, 300. For example, discrete microwell array slides may be arrayed in
parallel on a plate holder. In some cases, at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 25, 50 or 100
microwell arrays are arrayed in parallel. In other cases, at most 100, 50, 25, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6,
5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 devices are arrayed in parallel.
The microwell arrays within a common device may be manipulated simultaneously or
sequentially. For example, arrayed devices may be loaded with samples or capsules
simultaneously or sequentially.
         B.      Microwell Array Fluids
[0083] The microwell array may comprise any of a number of different fluids including
aqueous, non-aqueous, oils, and organic solvents, such as alcohols. In some cases, the
fluid is used to carry a component, e.g., reagent, microcapsule, or analyte, to a target
location such as microwells, output port, etc. In other cases, the fluid is used to flush the
system. In still other cases, the fluid may be used to seal the microwells.
[0084] Any fluid or buffer that is physiologically compatible with the analytes (e.g., cells,
molecules) or reagents used in the device may be used. In some cases, the fluid is
aqueous (buffered or not buffered). For example, a sample comprising a population of
cells suspended in a buffered aqueous solution may be introduced into the microwell
array, allowed to flow through the device, and distributed to the microwells. In other
cases, the fluid passing through the device is nonaqueous (e.g., oil). Exemplary non
aqueous fluids include but are not limited to: oils, non-polar solvent, hydrocarbon oil,
decane (e.g., tetradecane or hexadecane), fluorocarbon oil, fluorinated oil, silicone oil,
mineral oil, or other oil.
[0085] Often, the microcapsules are suspended in a fluid that is compatible with the
components of the shell of the microcapsule. Fluids including but not limited to water,
alcohols, hydrocarbon oils or fluorocarbon oils are particularly useful fluids for
suspending and flowing microcapsules through the microarray device.
                                              -22-

WO 2014/028537                                                          PCT/US2013/054797
        C.       Further Partitioning and Sealing
[0086]   After the analyte, free reagents, and/or microcapsules are loaded into the device
and distributed to the microwells, a sealing fluid may be used to further partition or isolate
them within the microwells. The sealing fluid may also be used to seal the individual
wells. The sealing fluid may be introduced through the same inlet port that was used to
introduce the analyte, reagents and/or microcapsules. But in some cases, the sealing fluid
is introduced to the device by a separate inlet port, or through multiple separate inlet
ports.
[0087] Often, the sealing fluid is a non-aqueous fluid (e.g., oil). When the sealing fluid
flows through the microwell array device, it may displace excess aqueous solution (e.g.,
solution comprising analytes, free reagents and/or microcapsules) from individual
microwells, thereby potentially removing aqueous bridges between adjacent microwells.
The wells themselves, as described herein, may comprise a hydrophilic material that
enables wicking of the aqueous fluids (e.g., sample fluid, microcapsule fluid) into
individual wells. In some cases, regions external to the wells comprise hydrophobic
material, again to encourage the positioning of the aqueous fluid into the interior of the
microwells.
[0088] The sealing fluid may either remain in the device or be removed. The sealing
fluid may be removed, e.g., by flowing through the outlet port. In other cases, the sealing
oil may comprise a volatile oil that can be removed by the application of heat. Once the
sealing fluid is removed, analytes, free reagents and/or microcapsules may be physically
partitioned from one another in the microwells.
[0089] A fluid may be selected such that its density is equal to, greater than or less than
the density of the microcapsules. For example, the microcapsules may be denser than the
sealing oil and/or aqueous fluid of the sample and reagents, thereby enabling the
microcapsules to remain in the microwells as the sealing oil flows through the device.      In
another example, the capsules may be less dense than the aqueous fluid of the sample or
the fluid that the microcapsules are suspended in, as described herein, thereby facilitating
movement and distribution of the capsules across the plurality of microwells in a device.
[0090] In the case of microcapsules comprising paramagnetic material, a magnetic field
may be used to load or direct the capsules into the microwells. A magnetic field may also
be used to retain such microcapsules within the wells while the wells are being filled with
                                              -23-

WO 2014/028537                                                            PCT/US2013/054797
sample, reagent, and/or sealing fluids. The magnetic field may also be used to remove
capsule shells from the wells, particularly following rupture of the capsules.
[0091] In some cases, the sealing fluid may remain in the microwells when operations or
reactions are conducted therein. The presence of the sealing fluid may act to further
partition, isolate, or seal the individual microwells. In other cases, the sealing fluid may
act as a carrier for the microcapsules. For example, sealing fluid comprising
microcapsules may be introduced to the device to facilitate distribution of the
microcapsules to the individual microwells. For such applications, the sealing fluid may
be denser than the microcapsules in order to encourage more even distribution of the
microcapsules to the microwells. Upon application of a stimulus, the microcapsules
within the sealing fluid may release reagents to the microwell. In some cases, the sealing
fluid may comprise a chemical or other agent capable of traveling from the sealing fluid
to a well (e.g., by leaching or other mechanism) and triggering capsule rupture, where the
capsule is present within the microwell or within the sealing fluid.
[0092] Methods other than those involving sealing fluids may also be used to seal the
microwells following the loading of the analyte, free reagents, and/or microcapsules. For
example, the microwells may be sealed with a laminate, tape, plastic cover, oils, waxes, or
other suitable material to create an enclosed reaction chamber. The sealants described
herein may protect the contents of the microwells from evaporation or other unintended
consequences of the reactions or operations. Prevention of evaporation may be
particularly necessary when heat is applied to the device, e.g., when heat is applied to
stimulate microcapsule release.
[0093] In some cases, the laminate seal may also allow recovery of contents from
individual wells. In this case, a single well of interest may be unsealed (e.g., by removal
of the laminate seal) at a given time in order to enable further analysis of an analyte such
as by MALDI mass spectrometry. Such applications may be useful in a number of
settings, including high-throughput drug screening.
IV. Loading Step(s)
[0094] As described herein, analytes, free reagents, and/or microcapsules may be loaded
into the present device in any appropriate manner or order. The loading may be random
or non-random. In some cases, a precise number of analytes and/or microcapsules are
loaded into each individual microwell. In some cases, a precise number of analytes
and/or microcapsules are loaded into a particular subset of microwells in the plate. In still
                                               -24-

WO 2014/028537                                                               PCT/US2013/054797
other cases, an average number of analytes and/or micrcocapsules are loaded into each
individual microwell. Furthermore, as described herein, in some cases, "dry"
microcapsules are loaded into the device, while in other cases "wet" microcapsules are
loaded into the device. In some cases, a combination of "dry" and "wet" microcapsules
and/or reagents are loaded into the device, either simultaneously or sequentially.
[0095] As mentioned herein, the loading of the device may occur in any order and may
occur in multiple stages. In some cases, the microcapsules are pre-loaded into the device,
prior to the loading of the analyte. In other cases, the microcapsules and analyte are
loaded concurrently. In still other cases, the analytes are loaded before the microcapsules
are loaded.
[0096] The microcapsules and/or analytes may be loaded in multiple stages or multiple
times. For example, microcapsules may be loaded into the device both prior to and after
analytes are loaded into the device. The microcapsules that are pre-loaded (e.g., loaded
prior to the analyte introduction) may comprise the same reagents as the microcapsules
loaded after the analyte introduction. In other cases, the pre-loaded microcapsules contain
reagents that are different from the reagents within the microcapsules loaded after analyte
introduction. In some cases, at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, or 20 different sets of
microcapsules are loaded onto the device. In some cases, the different sets of
microcapsules are loaded sequentially; or, different sets of microcapsules may also be
loaded simultaneously. Similarly, multiple sets of analytes can be loaded into the device.
In some cases, at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, or 20 different sets of analytes are
loaded onto the device. In some cases, the different sets of analytes are loaded
sequentially; or, different sets of analytes may also be loaded simultaneously.
[0097] This disclosure provides devices comprising certain numbers of microcapsules
and/or analytes loaded per well. In some cases, at most 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20,
30, 40, 50, 75, or 100 microcapsules and/or analytes are loaded into each individual
microwell. In some cases, at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, or 100
microcapsules and/or analytes are loaded into each individual microwell. In some cases,
on average, at most 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, or 100 microcapsules
and/or analytes are loaded into each individual microwell. In other cases, on average, at
least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, or 100 microcapsules and/or
analytes are loaded into each individual microwell. In some cases, about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
                                                  -25-

WO 2014/028537                                                           PCT/US2013/054797
8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, or 100 microcapsules and/or analytes are loaded into each
individual microwell.
[0098] Analytes and/or microcapsules may be applied in a quantity that allows a desired
number of analytes to be deposited into an individual microwell. For example, terminal
dilution of analytes, such as cells, may achieve the loading of one cell per one microwell
or any desired number of analytes per microwell. In some cases, a Poisson distribution is
used to direct or predict the final concentration of analytes or microcapsules per well.
[0099] The microcapsules may be loaded into the microarray device in a particular
pattern. For example, certain sections of the device may comprise microcapsules
containing a particular reagent (e.g., unique bar-code, enzyme, antibody, antibody
subclass, etc.), while other sections of the device may comprise microcapsules containing
a different reagent (e.g., a different bar-code, different enzyme, different antibody
different antibody subclass, etc.). In some cases, the microcapsules in one section of the
array may contain control reagents. For example, they may contain positive controls that
include a control analyte and necessary materials for a reaction. Or, in some cases, the
microcapsules contain negative control reagents such as deactivated enzyme, or a
synthetic oligonucleotide sequence that is resistant to fragmentation. In some cases,
negative control reagents may control for the specificity of the sample preparation
reaction etc. In other cases, the negative control microcapsules may comprise the same
reagents present in other microcapsules except that the negative control microcapsule may
lack a certain reagent (e.g., lysis buffer, polymerase, etc.).
[00100] The analytes/sample also may be loaded into the microarray device in a particular
pattern. For example, certain sections of the device may comprise particular analytes,
such as control analytes or analytes deriving from a particular source. This may be used
in combination with specific loading of bar codes into known well locations. This feature
may allow mapping of specific locations on the array to sequence data, thereby reducing
the number of bar codes to be used for labeling reactions.
[00101] In cases where a partition is a droplet, an analyte and reagents may be combined
within the droplet with the aid of a microfluidic device. For example, a droplet may be

nucleic acid analyte, and any other desired reagents. The gel bead, nucleic acid analyte,
and reagents in an aqueous phase may be combined at a junction of two or more channels
of a microfluidic device. At a second junction of two or more channels of the

V. Microcapsule Stimuli
[00102] Various different stimuli may be used to trigger release of reagents from the
microcapsules, or from internal compartments therein. In some cases, a microcapsule is
degradable. Generally, the trigger may cause disruption or degradation of the shell or
membrane enveloping the microcapsule, disruption or degradation of the interior of a
microcapsule, and/or disruption or degradation of any chemical bonds that immobilize a
reagent to the microcapsule. Exemplary triggers include but are not limited to: chemical
triggers, bulk changes, biological triggers, light triggers, thermal triggers, magnetic
triggers, and any combination thereof. See, e.g., Esser-Kahn et al., (2011)
Macromolecules 44: 5539-5553; Wang et al., (2009) ChemPhysChem 10:2405-2409;
        A.      Chemical Stimuli and Bulk Changes
[00103] Numerous chemical triggers may be used to trigger the disruption or degradation
of the microcapsules. Examples of these chemical changes may include, but are not
limited to pH-mediated changes to the shell wall, disintegration of the shell wall via
chemical cleavage of crosslink bonds, triggered depolymerization of the shell wall, and
shell wall switching reactions. Bulk changes may also be used to trigger disruption of the
microcapsules.
[00104]A change in pH of the solution, particularly a decrease in pH, may trigger
disruption via a number of different mechanisms. The addition of acid may cause
degradation or disassembly of the shell wall through a variety of mechanisms. Addition
of protons may disassemble cross-linking of polymers in the shell wall, disrupt ionic or
hydrogen bonds in the shell wall, or create nanopores in the shell wall to allow the inner
contents to leak through to the exterior. In some examples, the microcapsule comprises
acid-degradable chemical cross-linkers such a ketals. A decrease in pH, particular to a pH
lower than 5, may induce the ketal to convert to a ketone and two alcohols and facilitate
disruption of the microcapsule. In other examples, the microcapsules may comprise one
or more polyelectrolytes (e.g., PAA, PAAm, PSS, etc.) that are pH sensitive. A decrease
in pH may disrupt the ionic- or hydrogen-bonding interactions of such microcapsules, or
create nanopores therein. In some cases, microcapsules comprising polyelectrolytes
comprise a charged, gel-based core that expands and contracts upon a change of pH.
                                              -27-

WO 2014/028537                                                           PCT/US2013/054797
[00105] Removal of cross-linkers (e.g., disulfide bonds) within the microcapsules can also
be accomplished through a number of mechanisms. In some examples, various chemicals
can be added to a solution of microcapsules that induce either oxidation, reduction or
other chemical changes to polymer components of the shell wall. In some cases, a
reducing agent, such as beta-mercaptoethanol, dithiotheritol (DTT), or 2- tris(2
carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), is added such that disulfide bonds in a microcapsule
shell wall are disrupted. In addition, enzymes may be added to cleave peptide bonds
within the microcapsules, thereby resulting in cleavage of shell wall cross linkers.
[00106] Depolymerization can also be used to disrupt the microcapsules. A chemical
trigger may be added to facilitate the removal of a protecting head group. For example,
the trigger may cause removal of a head group of a carbonate ester or carbamate within a
polymer, which in turn causes depolymerization and release of reagents from the inside of
the capsule.
[00107] Shell wall switching reactions may be due to any structural change to the porosity
of the shell wall. The porosity of a shell wall may be modified, for example, by the
addition of azo dyes or viologen derivatives. Addition of energy (e.g., electricity, light)
may also be used to stimulate a change in porosity.
[00108] In yet another example, a chemical trigger may comprise an osmotic trigger,
whereby a change in ion or solute concentration of microcapsule solution induces
swelling of the capsule. Swelling may cause a buildup of internal pressure such that the
capsule ruptures to release its contents.
[00109] It is also known in the art that bulk or physical changes to the microcapsule
through various stimuli also offer many advantages in designing capsules to release
reagents. Bulk or physical changes occur on a macroscopic scale, in which capsule
rupture is the result of mechano-physical forces induced by a stimulus. These processes
may include, but are not limited to pressure induced rupture, shell wall melting, or
changes in the porosity of the shell wall.
        B.       Biological Stimuli
[00110] Biological stimuli may also be used to trigger disruption or degradation of
microcapsules. Generally, biological triggers resemble chemical triggers, but many
examples use biomolecules, or molecules commonly found in living systems such as
enzymes, peptides, saccharides, fatty acids, nucleic acids and the like. For example,
microcapsules may comprise polymers with peptide cross-links that are sensitive to
                                              -28-

WO 2014/028537                                                           PCT/US2013/054797
cleavage by specific proteases. More specifically, one example may comprise a
microcapsule comprising GFLGK peptide cross links. Upon addition of a biological
trigger such as the protease Cathepsin B, the peptide cross links of the shell well are
cleaved and the contents of the capsule are released. In other cases, the proteases may be
heat-activated. In another example, microcapsules comprise a shell wall comprising
cellulose. Addition of the hydrolytic enzyme chitosan serves as biologic trigger for
cleavage of cellulosic bonds, depolymerization of the shell wall, and release of its inner
contents.
         C.     Thermal Stimuli
[00111] The microcapsules may also be induced to release their contents upon the
application of a thermal stimulus. A change in temperature can cause a variety changes to
the microcapsule. A change in heat may cause melting of a microcapsule such that the
shell wall disintegrates. In other cases, the heat may increase the internal pressure of the
inner components of the capsule such that the capsule ruptures or explodes. In still other
cases, the heat may transform the capsule into a shrunken dehydrated state. The heat may
also act upon heat-sensitive polymers within the shell of a microcapsule to cause
disruption of the microcapsule.
[00112] In one example, a microcapsule comprises a thermo-sensitive hydrogel shell
encapsulating one or more emulsified reagent particles. Upon the application of heat,
such as above 35 C, the hydrogel material of the outer shell wall shrinks. The sudden
shrinkage of the shell ruptures the capsule and allows the reagents of the inside of the
capsule to squirt out in the sample preparation solution in the microwell.
[00113] In some cases, the shell wall may comprise a diblock polymer, or a mixture of two
polymers, with different heat sensitivities. One polymer may be particularly likely to
shrink after the application of heat, while the other is more heat-stable. When heat is
applied to such shell wall, the heat-sensitive polymer may shrink, while the other remains
intact, causing a pore to form. In still other cases, a shell wall may comprise magnetic
nanoparticles. Exposure to a magnetic field may cause the generation of heat, leading to
rupture of the microcapsule.
         D.     Magnetic Stimuli
[00114] Inclusion of magnetic nanoparticles to the shell wall of microcapsules may allow
triggered rupture of the capsules as well as guide the particles in an array. A device of
this disclosure may comprise magnetic particles for either purpose. In one example,
                                               -29-

WO 2014/028537                                                           PCT/US2013/054797
incorporation of Fe304 nanoparticles into polyelectrolyte containing capsules triggers
rupture in the presence of an oscillating magnetic field stimulus.
         E.      Electrical and Light Stimuli
[00115]A microcapsule may also be disrupted or degraded as the result of electrical
stimulation. Similar to magnetic particles described in the previous section, electrically
sensitive particles can allow for both triggered rupture of the capsules as well as other
functions such as alignment in an electric field, electrical conductivity or redox reactions.
In one example, microcapsules containing electrically sensitive material are aligned in an
electric field such that release of inner reagents can be controlled. In other examples,
electrical fields may induce redox reactions within the shell wall itself that may increase
porosity.
[00116]A light stimulus may also be used to disrupt the microcapsules. Numerous light
triggers are possible and may include systems that use various molecules such as
nanoparticles and chromophores capable of absorbing photons of specific ranges of
wavelengths. For example, metal oxide coatings can be used as capsule triggers. UV
irradiation of polyelectrolyte capsules coated with SiO2/TiO2 may result in disintegration
of the capsule wall. In yet another example, photo switchable materials such as
azobenzene groups may be incorporated in the shell wall. Upon the application of UV or
visible light, chemicals such as these undergo a reversible cis-to-trans isomerization upon
absorption of photons. In this aspect, incorporation of photo switches result in a shell
wall that may disintegrate or become more porous upon the application of a light trigger.
         F.      Application of Stimuli
[00117]A device of this disclosure may be used in combination with any apparatus or
device that provides such trigger or stimulus. For example, if the stimulus is thermal, a
device may be used in combination with a heated or thermally controlled plate, which
allows heating of the microwells and may induce the rupture of capsules. Any of a
number of heat transfers may be used for thermal stimuli, including but not limited to
applying heat by radiative heat transfer, convective heat transfer, or conductive heat
transfer. In other cases, if the stimulus is a biological enzyme, the enzyme may be
injected into a device such that it is deposited into each microwell. In another aspect, if
the stimulus is a magnetic or electric field, a device may be used in combination with a
magnetic or electric plate.
                                               -30-

WO 2014/028537                                                            PCT/US2013/054797
[00118]A chemical stimulus may be added to a partition and may exert its function at
various times after contacting a chemical stimulus with a microcapsule.      The speed at
which a chemical stimulus exerts its effect may vary depending on, for example, the
amount/concentration of a chemical stimulus contacted with a microcapsule and/or the
particular chemical stimulus used. For example, a droplet may comprise a degradable gel
bead (e.g., a gel bead comprising chemical cross-linkers, such as, for example, disulfide
bonds). Upon droplet formation, a chemical stimulus (e.g., a reducing agent) may be
included in the droplet with the gel bead. The chemical stimulus may degrade the gel
bead immediately on contact with the gel bead, soon after (e.g., about 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 min) contact with the gel bead, or at a later time. In some cases,
degradation of the gel bead may occur before, during, or after a further processing step,
such as, for example, a thermal cycling step as described herein.
VI. Sample Preparation, Reaction and Recovery
[00119] After application of the stimulus, rupturing of capsules and release of the reagents,
the sample preparation reaction may proceed in a device. Reactions within a device may
be incubated for various periods of times depending on the reagents used in the sample
reactions. A device may also be used in combination with other devices that aid in the
sample preparation reaction. For example, if PCR amplification is desired, a device may
be used in combination with a PCR thermocycler. In some cases, a thermocycler may
comprise a plurality of wells. In cases where partitions are droplets, the droplets may be
entered into the wells of the thermocycler. In some cases, each well may comprise
multiple droplets, such that when thermal cycling is initiated, multiple droplets are
thermal cycled in each well. In another example, if the reaction requires agitation, a
device may be used in combination with a shaking apparatus.
[00120] Following the completion of the sample preparation reaction, the analytes and
products of the sample reactions may be recovered. In some cases, a device may utilize a
method comprising the application of liquid or gas to flush out the contents of the
individual microwells. In one example, the liquid comprises an immiscible carrier fluid
that preferentially wets the microwell array material. It may also be immiscible with
water so as to flush the reaction products out of the well. In another example, the liquid
may be an aqueous fluid that can be used to flush out the samples out of the wells. After
flushing of the contents of the microwells, the contents of the microwells are pooled for a
variety of downstream analyses and applications.
                                              -31-

WO 2014/028537                                                            PCT/US2013/054797
VII. Applications
[00121] Figure 4A provides a general flow of many of the methods of the present
disclosure; and Figure 4B provides a generally annotated version of 4A. One or more
microcapsule(s) that contain reagents 410 may be pre-loaded into microwells, followed by
addition of an analyte, which, in this particular Figure, is a nucleic acid analyte 420. The
microwells may then be sealed 430 by any method, such as by application of a sealing
fluid. The inlet and outlet ports may also be sealed, for example to prevent evaporation.
Following these steps, a stimulus (e.g., heat, chemical, biological, etc.) may be applied to
the microwells in order to disrupt the microcapsules 460 and trigger release of the
reagents 450 to the interior of the microwell. Subsequently, an incubation step 440 may
occur in order to enable the reagents perform a particular function such as lysis of cells,
digestion of protein, fragmentation of high molecular weight nucleic acids, or ligation of
oligonucleotide bar codes. Following the incubation step (which is optional), the
contents of the microwells may be recovered either singly or in bulk.
         A.       Analytes
[00122]A device of this disclosure may have a wide variety of uses in the manipulation,
preparation, identification and/or quantification of analytes. In some cases, the analyte is
a cell or population of cells. The population of cells may be homogeneous (e.g., from a
cell line, of the same cell type, from the same type of tissue, from the same organ, etc.) or
heterogenous (mixture of different types of cells). The cells may be primary cells, cell
lines, recombinant cells, primary cells, encapsulated cells, free cells, etc.
[00123] The analytes may also be molecules, including but not limited to: polypeptides,
proteins, antibodies, enzymes, nucleic acids, saccharides, small molecules, drugs, and the
like. Examples of nucleic acids include but are not limited to: DNA, RNA, dNTPs,
ddNTPs, amplicons, synthetic nucleotides, synthetic polynucleotides, polynucleotides,
oligonucleotides, peptide nucleic acids, cDNA, dsDNA, ssDNA, plasmid DNA, cosmid
DNA, high Molecular Weight (MW) DNA, chromosomal DNA, genomic DNA, viral
DNA, bacterial DNA, mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA), mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, nRNA,
siRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, scaRNA, microRNA, dsRNA, ribozyme, riboswitch and viral
RNA (e.g., retroviral RNA).
[00124] In some cases, the analytes are pre-mixed with one or more additional materials,
such as one or more reagents (e.g., ligase, protease, polymerase) prior to being loaded into
                                              -32-

WO 2014/028537                                                           PCT/US2013/054797
the device. In some cases, the analytes are pre-mixed with microcapsules comprising one
or more reagents prior to being loaded onto the device.
[00125] The samples may be derived from a variety of sources including human, mammal,
non-human mammal, ape, monkey, chimpanzee, plant, reptilian, amphibian, avian,
fungal, viral or bacterial sources. Samples such as cells, nucleic acids and proteins may
also be obtained from a variety of clinical sources such as biopsies, aspirates, blood
draws, urine samples, formalin fixed embedded tissues and the like.
[00126]A device of this disclosure may also enable the analytes to be tagged or tracked in
order to permit subsequent identification of an origin of the analytes. This feature is in
contrast with other methods that use pooled or multiplex reactions and that only provide
measurements or analyses as an average of multiple samples. Here, the physical
partitioning and assignment of a unique identifier to individual analytes allows acquisition
of data from individual samples and is not limited to averages of samples.
[00127] In some examples, nucleic acids or other molecules derived from a single cell
may share a common tag or identifier and therefore may be later identified as being
derived from that cell. Similarly, all of the fragments from a single strand of nucleic acid
may be tagged with the same identifier or tag, thereby permitting subsequent
identification of fragments with similar phasing or linkage on the same strand. In other
cases, gene expression products (e.g., mRNA, protein) from an individual cell may be
tagged in order to quantify expression. In still other cases, the device can be used as a
PCR amplification control. In such cases, multiple amplification products from a PCR
reaction can be tagged with the same tag or identifier. If the products are later sequenced
and demonstrate sequence differences, differences among products with the same
identifier can then be attributed to PCR error.
[00128] The analytes may be loaded onto the device before, after, or during loading of the
microcapsules and/or free reagents. In some cases, the analytes are encapsulated into
microcapsules before loading into the microcapsule array. For example, nucleic acid
analytes may be encapsulated into a microcapsule, which is then loaded onto the device
and later triggered to release the analytes into an appropriate microwell.
[00129] Any analytes, such as DNA or cells, may be loaded in solution or as analytes
encapsulated in a capsule. In some cases, homogeneous or heterogeneous populations of
molecules (e.g., nucleic acids, proteins, etc.) are encapsulated into microcapsules and
loaded onto the device. In some cases, homogeneous or heterogeneous populations of
                                              -33-

WO 2014/028537                                                            PCT/US2013/054797
cells are encapsulated into microcapsules and loaded onto the device. The microcapsules
may comprise a random or specified number of cells and/or molecules. For example, the
microcapsules may comprise no more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30,40 ,50, 60,
70, 80, 90, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, or 10000 cells and/or molecules per microcapsule. In
other examples, the microcapsules comprise at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30,40,
50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, or 10000 cells and/or molecules per
microcapsule. Fluidic techniques and any other techniques may be used to encapsulate
the cells and/or molecules into the microcapsules.
[00130] Generally, the methods and compositions provided herein are useful for
preparation of an analyte prior to a down-stream application such as a sequencing
reaction. Often, a sequencing method is classic Sanger sequencing. Sequencing methods
may include, but are not limited to: high-throughput sequencing, pyrosequencing,
sequencing-by-synthesis, single-molecule sequencing, nanopore sequencing, sequencing
by-ligation, sequencing-by-hybridization, RNA-Seq (Illumina), Digital Gene Expression
(Helicos), Next generation sequencing, Single Molecule Sequencing by Synthesis
(SMSS)(Helicos), massively-parallel sequencing, Clonal Single Molecule Array (Solexa),
shotgun sequencing, Maxim-Gilbert sequencing, primer walking, and any other
sequencing methods known in the art.
[00131] There are numerous examples of applications that may be conducted instead of,
or in conjunction with, a sequencing reaction, including but not limited to: biochemical
analyses, proteomics, immunoassays, profiling/fingerprinting of specific cell types,
pharmaceutical screening, bait-capture experiments, protein-protein interaction screens
and the like.
        B.        Assignment of Unique Identifiers to Analytes
[00132] The devices disclosed herein may be used in applications that involve the
assignment of unique identifiers, or molecular bar codes, to analytes. Often, the unique
identifier is a bar-code oligonucleotide that is used to tag the analytes; but, in some cases,
different unique identifiers are used. For example, in some cases, the unique identifier is
an antibody, in which case the attachment may comprise a binding reaction between the
antibody and the analyte (e.g., antibody and cell, antibody and protein, antibody and
nucleic acid). In other cases, the unique identifier is a dye, in which case the attachment
may comprise intercalation of the dye into the analyte molecule (such as intercalation into
DNA or RNA) or binding to a probe labeled with the dye. In still other cases, the unique
                                             -34-

WO 2014/028537                                                           PCT/US2013/054797
identifier may be a nucleic acid probe, in which case the attachment to the analyte may
comprise a hybridization reaction between the nucleic acid and the analyte. In some
cases, the reaction may comprise a chemical linkage between the identifier and the
analyte. In other cases, the reaction may comprise addition of a metal isotope, either
directly to the analyte or by a probe labeled with the isotope.
[00133] Often, the method comprises attaching oligonucleotide bar codes to nucleic acid
analytes through an enzymatic reaction such as a ligation reaction. For example, the
ligase enzyme may covalently attach a DNA bar code to fragmented DNA (e.g., high
molecular-weight DNA). Following the attachment of the bar-codes, the molecules may
be subjected to a sequencing reaction.
However, other reactions may be used as well. For example, oligonucleotide primers
containing bar code sequences may be used in amplification reactions (e.g., PCR, qPCR,
reverse-transcriptase PCR, digital PCR, etc.) of the DNA template analytes, thereby
producing tagged analytes. After assignment of bar codes to individual analytes, the
contents of individual microwells may be recovered via the outlet port in the device for
further analyses.
[00134] The unique identifiers (e.g., oligonucleotide bar-codes, antibodies, probes, etc.)
may be introduced to the device randomly or nonrandomly. In some cases, they are
introduced at an expected ratio of unique identifiers to microwells. For example, the
unique identifiers may be loaded so that more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20,
50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, or 200000 unique identifiers are loaded per microwell.
In some cases, the unique identifiers may be loaded so that less than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, or 200000 unique identifiers are loaded
per microwell. In some cases, the average number of unique identifiers loaded per
microwell is less than, or greater than, about 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, or 200000 unique identifiers per microwell.
[00135] The unique identifiers also may be loaded so that a set of one or more identical
identifiers are introduced to a particular well. Such sets may also be loaded so that each
microwell contains a different set of identifiers. For example, a population of
microcapsules may be prepared such that a first microcapsule in the population comprises
multiple copies of identical unique identifiers (e.g., nucleic acid bar codes, etc.) and a
second microcapsule in the population comprises multiple copies of a unique identifier
that differs from within the first microcapsule. In some cases, the population of
                                             -35-

WO 2014/028537                                                             PCT/US2013/054797
microcapsules may comprise multiple microcapsules (e.g., greater than 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,100,500,1000,5000,10000,100000,1000000,
10000000, 100000000, or 1000000000 microcapsules), each containing multiple copies of
a unique identifier that differs from that contained in the other microcapsules. In some
cases, the population may comprise greater than 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30,
35,40,45,50, 100,500, 1000,5000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000,or
1000000000 microcapsules with identical sets of unique identifiers. In some cases, the
population may comprise greater than 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45,
50, 100,500, 1000,5000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000,or
1000000000 microcapsules, wherein the microcapsules each comprise a different
combination of unique identifiers. For example, in some cases the different combinations
overlap, such that a first microcapsule may comprise, e.g., unique identifiers A, B, and C,
while a second microcapsule may comprise unique identifiers A, B, and D. In another
example, the different combinations do not overlap, such that a first microcapsule may
comprise, e.g., unique identifiers A, B, and C, while a second microcapsule may comprise
unique identifiers D, E, and F.
[00136] The unique identifiers may be loaded into the device at an expected or predicted
ratio of unique identifiers per analyte (e.g., strand of nucleic acid, fragment of nucleic
acid, protein, cell, etc.) In some cases, the unique identifiers are loaded in the microwells
so that more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, or
200000 unique identifiers are loaded per individual analyte in the microwell. In some
cases, the unique identifiers are loaded in the microwells so that less than about 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, or 200000 unique identifiers are
loaded per individual analyte in the microwell. In some cases, the average number of
unique identifiers loaded per analyte is less than, or greater than, about 0.000 1, 0.00 1,
0.01, 0.1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, or 200000
unique identifiers per analyte. When more than one identifier is present per analyte, such
identifiers may be copies of the same identifier, or multiple different identifiers. For
example, the attachment process may be designed to attach multiple identical identifiers
to a single analyte, or multiple different identifiers to the analyte.
[00137] The unique identifiers may be used to tag a wide range of analytes, including cells
or molecules. For example, unique identifiers (e.g., bar code oligonucleotides) may be
attached to whole strands of nucleic acids or to fragments of nucleic acids (e.g.,
                                                 -36-

WO 2014/028537                                                            PCT/US2013/054797
fragmented genomic DNA, fragmented RNA). The unique identifiers (e.g., antibodies,
oligonucleotides) may also bind to cells, include the external surface of a cell, a marker
expressed on the cell or components within the cell such as organelles, gene expression
products, genomic DNA, mitochondrial DNA, RNA, mRNA, or proteins. The unique
identifiers also may be designed to bind or hybridize nucleic acids (e.g., DNA, RNA)
present in permeabilized cells, which may or may not be otherwise intact.
[00138] The unique identifiers may be loaded onto the device either singly or in
combination with other elements (e.g., reagents, analytes). In some cases, free unique
identifiers are pooled with the analytes and the mixture is loaded into the device. In some
cases, unique identifiers encapsulated in microcapsules are pooled with the analytes, prior
to loading of the mixture onto the device. In still other cases, free unique identifiers are
loaded into the microwells prior to, during (e.g., by separate inlet port), or following the
loading of the analytes. In still other cases, unique identifiers encapsulated in
microcapsules are loaded into the microwells prior to, concurrently with (e.g., by separate
inlet port), or after loading of the analytes.
[001391 In many applications, it may be important to determine whether individual
analytes each receive a different unique identifier (e.g., oligonucleotide bar code). If the
population of unique identifiers introduced into the device is not significantly diverse,
different analytes may possibly be tagged with identical identifiers. The devices
disclosed herein may enable detection of analytes tagged with the same identifier. In
some cases, a reference analyte may be included with the population of analytes
introduced into the device. The reference analyte may be, for example, a nucleic acid
with a known sequence and a known quantity. After the population of analytes is loaded
and partitioned in the device, unique identifiers may be attached to the analytes, as
described herein. If the unique identifiers are oligonucleotide bar codes and the analytes
are nucleic acids, the tagged analytes may subsequently be sequenced and quantified.
These methods may indicate if one or more fragments and/or analytes may have been
assigned an identical bar code.
[00140] A method disclosed herein may comprise loading the device with the reagents
necessary for the assignment of bar codes to the analytes. In the case of ligation
reactions, reagents including, but not limited to, ligase enzyme, buffer, adapter
oligonucleotides, a plurality of unique identifier DNA bar codes and the like may be
loaded into the device. In the case of enrichment, reagents including but not limited to a
                                               -37-

WO 2014/028537                                                            PCT/US2013/054797
plurality of PCR primers, oligonucleotides containing unique identifying sequence, or bar
code sequence, DNA polymerase, DNTPs, and buffer and the like may be loaded into the
device. The reagents may be loaded as free reagents or as reagents encapsulated in
microcapsules.
        C. Nucleic Acid Sequencing
[00141] Nucleic acid sequencing may begin with the physical partitioning of sample
analytes into microwells at a particular density (e.g., about 1 analyte per microwell or
other density described herein). When nucleic acid bar codes are assigned to individual
analytes, it may then be possible to track individual molecules during subsequent steps
such as subsequent amplification and/or sequencing steps, even if the analytes are later
pooled together and treated en masse.
                a.      Nucleic Acid Phasing
[00142] The devices provided herein may be used to prepare analytes (e.g., nucleic acid
analytes) in such a manner that enables phasing or linkage information to be subsequently
obtained. Such information may allow for the detection of linked genetic variations in
sequences, including genetic variations (e.g., SNPs, mutations, indels, copy number
variations, transversions, translocations, inversions, etc.) that are separated by long
stretches of nucleic acids.    These variations may exist in either a cis or trans
relationship. In cis relationships, two or more genetic variations may exist in the same
polynucleic acid molecule or strand. In trans relationships, two or more genetic variations
may exist on multiple nucleic acid molecules or strands.
[00143] A method of determining nucleic acid phasing may comprise loading a nucleic
acid sample (e.g., a nucleic acid sample that spans a given locus or loci) into a device
disclosed herein, distributing the sample such that at most one molecule of nucleic acid is
present per microwell, and fragmenting the sample within the microwells. The method
may further comprise attaching unique identifiers (e.g., bar codes) to the fragmented
nucleic acids as described herein, recovering the nucleic acids in bulk, and performing a
subsequent sequencing reaction on the samples in order to detect genetic variations, such
as two different genetic variations. The detection of genetic variations tagged with two
different bar codes may indicate that the two genetic variations are derived from two
separate strands of DNA, reflecting a trans relationship.     Conversely, the detection of
two different genetic variations tagged with the same bar codes may indicate that the two
genetic variations are from the same strand of DNA, reflecting a cis relationship.
                                              -38-

WO 2014/028537                                                            PCT/US2013/054797
[00144] Phase information may be important for the characterization of the analyte,
particularly if the analyte derives from a subject at risk of, having, or suspected of a
having a particular disease or disorder (e.g., hereditary recessive disease such as Cystic
Fibrosis, cancer, etc.). The information may be able to distinguish between the following
possibilities: (1) two genetic variations within the same gene on the same strand of DNA
and (2) two genetic variations within the same gene but located on separate strands of
DNA. Possibility (1) may indicate that one copy of the gene is normal and the individual
is free of the disease, while possibility (2) may indicate that the individual has or will
develop the disease, particularly if the two genetic variations are damaging to the function
of the gene when present within the same gene copy. Similarly, the phasing information
may also be able to distinguish between the following possibilities: (1) two genetic
variations, each within a different gene on the same strand of DNA and (2) two genetic
variations, each within a different gene but located on separate strands of DNA.
                 b. Cell-specific information
[00145] The devices provided herein may be used to prepare cellular analytes in such a
manner that enables cell-specific information to be subsequently obtained. Such
information may enable detection of genetic variations (e.g., SNPs, mutations, indels,
copy number variations, transversions, translocations, inversions, etc.) on a cell-by-cell
basis, thereby enabling a determination of whether the genetic variation(s) are present in
the same cell or two different cells.
[00146] A method of determining nucleic acid cell-specific information may comprise
loading a cellular sample (e.g., a cellular sample from a subject) into a device disclosed
herein, distributing the sample such that at most one cell is present per microwell, lysing
the cells, and then tagging the nucleic acids within the cells with unique identifiers using a
method described herein. In some cases, microcapsules comprising unique identifiers are
loaded in the microwell array device (either before, during, or after the loading of the
cellular analytes) in such a manner that each cell is contacted with a different
microcapsule. The resulting tagged nucleic acids can then be pooled, sequenced, and
used to trace the origin of the nucleic acids. Nucleic acids with identical unique
identifiers may be determined to originate from the same cell, while nucleic acids with
different unique identifiers may be determined to originate from different cells.
[00147] In a more specific example, the methods herein may be used to detect the
distribution of oncogenic mutations across a population of cancer tumor cells. In this
                                               -39-

WO 2014/028537                                                              PCT/US2013/054797
example, some of the cells may have a mutation, or amplification, of an oncogene (e.g.,
HER2, BRAF, EGFR, KRAS) on two strands of DNA (homozygous), while others may
be heterozygous for the mutation, while still other cells may be wild-type and comprise
no mutations or other variation in the oncogene. The methods described herein may be
able to detect these differences, and also may enable quantification of the relative
numbers of homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type cells. Such information may be
used to stage a particular cancer or to monitor the progression of the cancer over time.
[00148] In some examples, this disclosure provides methods of identifying mutations in
two different oncogenes (e.g., KRAS and EGFR). If the same cell comprises genes with
both mutations, this may indicate a more aggressive form of cancer. In contrast, if the
mutations are located in two different cells, this may indicate that the cancer is more
benign, or less advanced.
[00149] The following is another specific example of cell-specific sequence determination.
In this example, a plurality of cells, such as from a tumor biopsy, is loaded into a device.
Single cells from the sample are deposited into individual wells and labeled with a DNA
bar code.
[00150] Loading of cells into a device may be achieved through non-random loading.
Parameters for non-random loading of analytes, such as cells, may be understood using an
interference function such that:
            "fraction multi-occupancy"=1 -         1 -    + Q where
         P= probability that a particular cell will attempt but not fit in the well (measure of
interference)
         N = number of wells
         L = number of labels = barcodes
         C = number of cells
[00151] As part of sample preparation reactions, cells may be lysed and many subsequent
reactions are possible, including RNA amplification, DNA amplification or antibody
screening for different target proteins and genes in individual cells. After the reaction, the
contents of the cells may be pooled together and could be further analyzed, such as by
DNA sequencing. With each cell assigned a unique barcode, further analyses may be
possible including but not limited to quantification of different gene levels or nucleic acid
sequencing of individual cells. In this example, it may be determined whether the tumor
comprises cells with different genetic backgrounds (e.g., cancer clones and subclones).
The relative number of each type of cell may also be calculated.
                                               -40-

WO 2014/028537                                                           PCT/US2013/054797
                 c. Amplification Control
[00152] As disclosed herein, the device can be used for purposes of controlling for
amplification errors, such as PCR errors. For example, a nucleic acid sample may be
partitioned into the microwells of the device. Following partitioning, the sample may be
subjected to a PCR amplification reaction within the microwells. The PCR products
within a microwell may be tagged with the same unique identifier, using a method
described herein. If the products are later sequenced and demonstrate sequence
differences, differences among products with the same identifier can then be attributed to
PCR error.
                 d. Gene-expressionProductsAnalysis
[00153] In other applications, a device may be used to detect gene product (e.g., protein,
mRNA) expression levels in a sample, often on a cell-by-cell basis. A sample may
comprise individual cells, a pool of mRNA extract from cells, or other collection of gene
products. In some instances, single cells may be loaded into microwells. In other
instances, a pool of mRNA or other gene product may be loaded such that a desired
quantity of mRNA molecules is loaded into individual microwells.
[00154] The methods provided herein may be particularly useful for RNA analysis. For
example, using the methods provided herein, unique identifiers may be assigned to
mRNA analytes either directly or to cDNA products of a reverse transcription reaction
performed on the mRNA analytes. The reverse transcription reaction may be conducted
within the microwells of the device following loading of the analytes. Reagents for the
reaction may include but are not limited to reverse transcriptase, DNA polymerase
enzyme, buffer, dNTPs, oligonucleotide primers, oligonucleotide primers containing bar
code sequences and the like. One or more reagents may be loaded into microcapsules or
loaded freely in solution into the device or a combination thereof. Sample preparation
may then be conducted, such as by fragmenting the cDNA and attaching unique
identifiers to the fragments. After sample preparation and recovery, the nucleic acid
products of the reaction may be further analyzed, such as by sequencing.
[00155] Additionally, a device may be used to characterize multiple cell markers, similar
to a flow cytometer. Any cell marker may be characterized, including cell-surface
markers (e.g., extracellular proteins, transmembrane markers) and markers located within
the internal portion of a cell (e.g., RNA, mRNA, microRNA, multiple copies of genes,
proteins, alternative splicing products, etc.).     For example, cells may be partitioned
                                               -41-

WO 2014/028537                                                             PCT/US2013/054797
within the device, as described herein, so that at most one cell is present within a
microwell. Cell markers such as nucleic acids (e.g., RNA) may be extracted and/or
fragmented prior to being labeled with a unique identifier (e.g., molecular bar code). Or,
alternatively, the nucleic acids may be labeled with a unique identifier without being
extracted and/or fragmented. The nucleic acids may then be subjected to further analysis
such as sequencing reactions designed to detect multiple gene expression products. Such
analysis may be useful in a number of fields. For example, if the starting cells are
immune cells (e.g., T cells, B cells, macrophages, etc.), the analysis may provide
information regarding multiple expressed markers and enable immunophenotyping of the
cells, for example by identifying different CD markers of the cells (e.g., CD3, CD4, CD8,
CD19, CD20, CD 56, etc.). Such markers can provide insights into the function,
character, class, or relative maturity of the cell. Such markers can also be used in
conjunction with markers that are not necessarily immunophenotyping markers, such as
markers of pathogenic infection (e.g., viral or bacterial protein, DNA, or RNA). In some
cases, the device may be used to identify at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70,
75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 200, 500, 700, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, or 100000 different
gene expression products or other form of cellular markers on a single-cell basis.        Often,
such methods do not comprise use of dyes or probes (e.g., fluorescent probes or dyes).
[00156] Gene expression product analysis may be useful in numerous fields including
immunology, cancer biology (e.g., to characterize the existence, type, stage,
aggressiveness, or other characteristic of cancerous tissue), stem cell biology (e.g., in
order to characterize the differentiation state of a stem cell, potency of a stem cell, cellular
type of a stem cell, or other features of a stem cell), microbiology, and others. The gene
expression analysis may also be used in drug screening applications, for example to
evaluate the effect of a particular drug or agent on the gene expression profile of
particular cells.
VIII. Terminology
[00157] The terminology used therein is for the purpose of describing particular
embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of a device of this disclosure. As
used herein, the singular forms "a", "an" and "the" are intended to include the plural
forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Furthermore, to the extent
that the terms "including", "includes", "having", "has", "with", or variants thereof are
                                               -42-

WO 2014/028537                                                           PCT/US2013/054797
used in either the detailed description and/or the claims, such terms are intended to be
inclusive in a manner similar to the term "comprising".
[00158] Several aspects of a device of this disclosure are described above with reference to
example applications for illustration. It should be understood that numerous specific
details, relationships, and methods are set forth to provide a full understanding of a
device. One having ordinary skill in the relevant art, however, will readily recognize that
a device can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other
methods. This disclosure is not limited by the illustrated ordering of acts or events, as
some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts or events.
Furthermore, not all illustrated acts or events are required to implement a methodology in
accordance with this disclosure.
[00159] Ranges can be expressed herein as from "about" one particular value, and/or to
"about" another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another embodiment
includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly,
when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent "about," it will be
understood that the particular value forms another embodiment. It will be further
understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the
other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. The term "about" as used herein
refers to a range that is 15% plus or minus from a stated numerical value within the
context of the particular usage. For example, about 10 would include a range from 8.5 to
11.5.
[00160] The term microwell array, as used herein, generally refers to a predetermined
spatial arrangement of microwells. Microwell array devices that comprise a microcapsule
may also be referred to as "microwell capsule arrays." Further, the term "array" may be
used herein to refer to multiple arrays arranged on a surface, such as would be the case
where a surface has multiple copies of an array. Such surfaces bearing multiple arrays
may also be referred to as "multiple arrays" or "repeating arrays."
Example 1 - Single cell DNA Sequencing
[00161] A microwell capsule array is prepared to perform nucleic acid sequencing on
individual human B-cells taken from a blood sample. Approximately 15,000 cells are
harvested and used for loading into the device. A device of this disclosure and containing
150,000 microwells is used. Each well is cylindrical in shape having a diameter of 125
um and a height of 125 um, allowing at most 1 capsule to be loaded per well.
                                             -43-

WO 2014/028537                                                            PCT/US2013/054797
Microcapsules made through emulsion polymerization with a PNIPAM hydrogel shell
wall are created such that the microcapsules have a diameter of 100 um for loading in the
device. The microcapsules are created such that the PNIPAM shell contains magnetic
iron particles. The outer surface of the shell is then chemically coupled to a antibody
specific to a transmembrane B cell receptor on the outside of a B cell.
[00162] During the preparation process of capsules, reagents are simultaneously loaded
into the capsules. Reagents necessary for cell lysis and labeling individual DNA strands
of the cells with DNA barcodes are loaded into capsules. Reagents for cell lysis include a
mild non-ionic detergent, buffer and salt. Reagents for the addition of DNA bar codes to
genomic DNA included restriction enzymes, ligase, and >10,000,000 unique DNA
oligonucleotides are loaded into capsules. Capsules are designed to be sensitive to
rupture at greater than 65 C.
[00163] Capsules are prepared to be applied to the microcapsule array. The array is placed
on a magnetic temperature controlled hot plate. Microcapsules are added to a sample of B
cells such that one B cell is able to bind to one capsule. Capsule-cell conjugates are
applied in aqueous carrier solution in a quantity in excess to the relative number of wells.
Gentle pipetting of capsules-cells into the inlet port followed by application of a vacuum
manifold to the outlet port distributes the capsules throughout the device. A magnetic
field is applied through the plate.   Excess capsule-cell solution is removed via pipetting
through the outlet port. Each capsule-cell conjugate is trapped and positioned in
individual wells via the magnetic field.
[00164] After the cells and capsules are loaded in the device, a carrier oil (or sealing fluid)
is applied to the device to remove any excess aqueous solution bridging adjacent
microwells. The carrier oil applied to the inlet and excess oil is recovered at the outlet
with a vacuum manifold. After the carrier oil is applied, the inlet and outlet ports are
sealed with tape.
[00165] The device is then heated, via the magnetic temperature controlled hot plate, to a
temperature of 70 C for 10 min to allow for capsule rupture and cell lysis. The hot plate
is then switched to 37 C, for restriction and ligation, for up to 1 hour.
[00166] After the sample preparation reaction is completed, the contents of the wells are
recovered. The inlet and outlet ports of the device are unsealed and nitrogen gas is
applied to the device to flush out the individual components of the microwells. The
                                              -44-

WO 2014/028537                                                           PCT/US2013/054797
sample is collected in bulk via a pipette at the outlet port, while the magnetic field retains
ruptured capsule shells in individual microwells.
[00167] The sample is then sequenced using a multiplex sequencing strategy known in the
art. Bar coding of individual cells allows for sequencing information to be gained for
individual cells rather than as an average of multiple cells. Based upon the number of
cells sequenced and bar codes assigned, SNP cell-specific information is gained.
Moreover, the number of reads for individual bar codes can be counted to provide insight
into the distribution of different types of cells with varying genetic backgrounds, within
the original population of B cells.
Example 2 - DNA Single Strand Sequencing
[00168] A microwell capsule array is prepared to perform nucleic acid sequencing on
individual strands of DNA isolated from a population of human skin cells. Cells are lysed
using detergent and heat and approximately 15,000 copies of diploid DNA are
precipitated via chloroform/ethanol extraction. A resuspension of DNA is loaded into the
device with approximately 10,000 copies of haploid DNA. A device of this disclosure,
with 300,000 microwells is used. Each well is cylindrical in shape having a diameter of
125 um and a height of 125 um, allowing at most 1 capsule to be loaded per well.
Microcapsules made through emulsion polymerization with a PNIPAM hydrogel shell
wall are created to a specification of a sphere with a diameter of 100 um for loading into
the device.
[00169] During the preparation of the microcapsules, reagents are simultaneously loaded
into the capsules. The reagents include reagents necessary for labeling individual DNA
strands with DNA barcodes, including restriction enzymes, ligase, and >10,000,000
unique DNA oligonucleotides. Capsules designed to be sensitive to rupture at greater
than 65 C are used for the encapsulation.
[00170] Capsules are applied aqueous carrier solution in an excess to the relative number
of wells. Gentle pipetting of capsules into the inlet followed by application of a vacuum
manifold to the outlet distributed the capsules throughout the device.     After excess
capsule solution is removed, a suspension of DNA in buffer is applied to the device in a
similar fashion as the capsules.
[00171] After the DNA strands and capsules are loaded in the device, a carrier oil is
applied to the device to remove any excess aqueous solution bridging adjacent
microwells. The carrier oil is applied to the inlet port and excess oil is recovered at the

outlet port with a vacuum manifold. After the carrier oil is applied, the inlet and outlet
ports are sealed with tape.
[00172] The device is then placed on a temperature controlled hot plate and heated to
temperature of 70 C for 10 min to allow for capsule rupture. Reagents are released into
the sample preparation reaction. The hot plate is then switched to 37 C, for restriction and
ligation, for up to 1 hour.
[00173] After the sample preparation reaction is completed, the inlet and outlet ports of the
device are unsealed and nitrogen gas is applied to the device to flush out the individual
components of the microwells. The sample products, en bulk, are collected via pipette at
the outlet port.
[00174] The sample is then sequenced to sufficient coverage (e.g., 500) using a multiplex
sequencing strategy known in the art. Bar coding of individual DNA strands allows for
sequencing information to be gained from individual strands rather than as an average of
entire sample of DNA. Based upon the number of DNA strands sequenced and bar codes
assigned, SNP phasing/haplotyping information is gained and many repetitive regions of
DNA can be resolved. In addition, a substantial boost in accuracy can be gained by
discarding mutations that appear randomly with respect to haplotypes, as those are likely
to be sequencing errors.
[00175] It should be understood from the foregoing that, while particular implementations
have been illustrated and described, various modifications may be made thereto and are
contemplated herein. It is also not intended that the invention be limited by the specific
examples provided within the specification. While the invention has been described with
reference to the aforementioned specification, the descriptions and illustrations of the
preferable embodiments herein are not meant to be construed in a limiting sense.
Furthermore, it shall be understood that all aspects of the invention are not limited to the
specific depictions, configurations or relative proportions set forth herein which depend
upon a variety of conditions and variables. Various modifications in form and detail of
the embodiments of the invention will be apparent to a person skilled in the art. It is
therefore contemplated that the invention shall also cover any such modifications,
variations and equivalents. It is intended that the following claims define the scope of the
invention and that methods and structures within the scope of these claims and their
equivalents be covered thereby.
