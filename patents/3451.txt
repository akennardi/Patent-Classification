                                          BACKGROUND
1.       Field
 [0002]             The     exemplary      embodiments          generally            relate     to
distributed            remote    sensing    systems       and,   more     particularly,         to
distributed            remote    sensing     systems       having    remote        sensors     for
sensing a predetermined physical characteristic.
2.       Brief Description of Related Developments
 [0003]             Parking      monitoring          /     detection          systems         have
traditionally            been    used  to    raise      revenue.        Such     devices      have
included          a  timer    and a   winding mechanism          requiring        coins.      More
recently,           electronic meters      have been developed             which      include an
electronic timer having an LCD time indicator.
 [0004]             With    the   advent     of      electronic      parking          monitoring
devices,          attempts     have   been    made     to   make   the     parking        monitors
interactive with vehicle traffic in the associated parking space.
One     way      to   obtain    information       about    vehicle    traffic         at   parking
spaces        is     to   couple   the  parking        monitor    to    a   vehicle        sensing
device.            The   vehicle    sensing     device      can   detect      when      a  vehicle
                                                   1

enters   a   parking           space    as    well       as     when     the     vehicle         leaves.
Attempts have also been made to centralized vehicle parking space
monitoring where data collected by the vehicle sensing devices is
ultimately     transferred           to   a  centralized             monitoring         location       for
analysis and application to user accounts.
[0005]      Generally,           the vehicle sensing devices and communication
means  between        the      vehicle      sensing         devices       and    the      centralized
monitoring     location         must    be   powered.             It   may be      prohibitive          to
provide hard lined power to each vehicle sensing device and each
communication       means.          As   such,      the      vehicle       sensing        devices      and
communications means may have limited power supplies.                                     The parking
monitoring     system        components       are      also      subject     to     failure        and/or
outages.
[0006]      It    would be          advantageous           to    have    a  distributed            remote
sensing    system       that       improves       reliability           through         one     or    more
redundancies in the system as well as improve power management of
the system components.

may     include   remote       sensors      for    sensing        characteristics           such  as
vehicle     detection,       traffic       patterns,        vehicle       navigation,       vehicle
position or any suitable predetermined characteristic.                                     Although
the     aspects   of   the     disclosed       embodiment          will      be    described    with
reference to the drawings,              it   should be understood that                 the aspects
of the      disclosed      embodiment        can   be     embodied        in    many    forms.    In
                                                 3

addition,          any suitable            size,        shape or type of elements or materials
could be used.

devices           130-132         which           may      include     any      suitable     display    for
displaying             any     suitable            information         pertaining       to  one   or   more
parking spaces.                 In other aspects the vehicle parking meter system
may       include          any      suitable             number     and     type     of   components     to
facilitate           the monitoring of the vehicle parking spaces associated
with the vehicle parking meter system 100.                                      The central controller
101 may be any                suitable controller capable of communicating with
the       one      or     more       gateways             110A-110C       (and     sensing    devices    in
communication with the one or more gateways) and the one or more
peripheral            devices        130-132           using     any   suitable      wireless    or  wired
communication interface                        link that        extends from the sensing devices
to the central controller and from the central controller to the
peripheral            devices        (it      is     noted that       the interface        may include a

network          145,     Internet          /     World     Wide Web       143,    Ethernet    144,   local
area        network         or    other          suitable       wireless        or   wired   protocol    or
connection.              In one aspect communications from the sensing devices
                                                              4

in the sensing device groups 120-122 may be provided substantially
in   real   time     to   the    central        controller           101     and/or        peripheral
devices 130-132.
 [0017]       The    central      controller          101      may     include        one     or     more
processors,      a    memory     and      any    other       suitable         hardware/software
configured      to    track    and       report,      for      each     parking         space      being
monitored,       a      user    of        the     parking           space,        parking          space
assignments/allocations,                time     of    arrival,          time      of      departure,
transaction        rates,     user         account       monetary          balances,           billing
transactions,        parking     violations,          parking         space      availability          or
any other suitable information pertaining to the use and billing
of each parking space monitored by the vehicle parking meter system
100.     The   central     controller          101   may      be    configured         with     one    or
more user interfaces to allow user access to and operation of the
central controller 101.               In one aspect the central controller 101
may   be  any   suitable      computing         device       having      a   monitor,         keyboard
and/or other       suitable user           interface.           In other aspects,               one or
more of the peripheral devices                130-132 may provide a user interface
for   accessing       and   operating         the    central         controller           101    either
through    any   suitable      long       or  short      range       wireless        communication
link   and/or    through     a   wired       connection.            The     central controller
101 may be configured to receive any suitable                          data from the sensing
devices.      The    data   sent      from the       sensing devices may include or
otherwise     embody,      for    example,        any      suitable        data      related        to  a
parking space being monitored, vehicle detection, and or a health
and   welfare/maintenance             status      of    the     sensing         device.         In    one
aspect the central controller 101 may be configured to perform any
suitable processing on the data from the sensing devices while in
other aspects the data from the sensing devices may be configured,
e.g. without processing by the central controller 101, for display
on one or more of the peripheral devices.
                                                 5

[0018]          In one aspect one or more of the peripheral devices 130
132 may include,            for example,            an enforcement          unit which may be a
hand held unit for use by parking/law enforcement personnel.                                        The
enforcement        unit     may     be     configured       to   report      parking    violations
and/or the       issuance of parking tickets to the                           central controller
101   so   that    electronic           ticketing         and data      capture     is  integrated
into the       distributed remote                 sensing system.            For example,        a law
enforcement officer using a peripheral device                                130-132 may arrive
at a parking space after being notified of a violation and make a
visual    inspection of the parking space to verify that there is a
vehicle in violation of a law.                        The violation may be entered into
the   peripheral          device        130-132        and   optionally         pictures      of    the
vehicle     in   violation          can be        taken with      the peripheral          device     or
otherwise       loaded      into      the peripheral           device.        A  citation may be
generated in any suitable manner, such as                            being printed from the
peripheral        device        130-132         and    affixed     to      the   vehicle      in    any
suitable manner.                  The enforcement unit may also report any other
actions taken by,             for example,           the parking enforcement              personnel
and/or    any     other      suitable         information       to the       central    controller
101.     As such, violation data entered into the peripheral device
is automatically captured and stored in a memory, such as a memory
of the central controller 101 in substantially real time.                                      As may
be    realized         storing          the       violation       information          within       the
distributed remote sensing system stops the                                system from alerting
an   enforcement          officer         to    that      space   until       another     violation
threshold is met or a new vehicle parks in the space.                                    In another
aspect, the sensing devices may also be used in non-parking spaces
such    as    in    front       of     fire      hydrants,      fire       lanes,    cross     walks,
intersections, etc.                The distributed remote sensing system can be
configured to create a violation after any suitable predetermined
time   period      whenever          a   vehicle       is   parked      in    one  of   these      non
parking spaces so that an alert is                         sent to an enforcement officer
                                                      6

through,        for     example,         a   peripheral        device    130-132.           As    may    be
realized,        the      distributed          remote      sensing    system may          incorporate
any other         suitable          sensors      such     as  cameras    and    infrared         sensors
that      may be used           in    conjunction with          the   sensing       devices        of the
sensor        groups        120-122.           Information        from    the      cameras         and/or
infrared        sensors         may    be   used     in    conjunction      with     the     violation
data provided by the sensing devices of the sensor groups                                        120-122
to     track     violations            and    the     history     of   the    violations.               The
violation        history         can be printed from,             e.g.,    a peripheral            device
130-132       for adjudication purposes,                     including parking            sensor time
stamps of vehicle entry/exit from a parking space.
 [0019]          The     one     or more       of   the peripheral         devices        130-132       may
also include,           for example,          a motorist unit which may be a handheld
unit      for use       by motorists           accessing       the parking        spaces      that      are
monitored by the vehicle parking meter system 100.                                    In one aspect
the motorist unit may be a dedicated vehicle parking system hand
held       unit     while        in     other     aspects       the   motorist         unit      may     be
integrated into a user's                   wireless phone,        vehicle GPS unit,            or other
user      computing          device        such    as     through    an   application           program
capable        of    running          on   the    wireless       phone,     GPS     unit      or    other
computing device.                 In still other aspects the motorist unit may be
implemented in any suitable manner for allowing the motorist to,
for     example,        check       an   account      balance,      add   funds      to    the     user's
account,        perform           billing/violation            payment      transactions,              find
available        parking         spaces     or any other suitable             action(s)         such as
reserving one or more parking spaces for a predetermined time and
date.        The motorist unit may provide a motorist with way finding
information,           e.g.      based on data           provided by the        sensing devices,
that includes a              substantially real time view of the availability
of parking         (and routing thereto) throughout the deployment area of
the distributed remote sensing system.                             The motorist           unit may be
                                                        7

configured to allow a user to select a location and see how full
the parking spaces are in an area using, for example, color coded
or     other      suitable         indicators.              Pricing        to   park   in    each      parking
space may also be provided.                          The way finding information provided
by the motorist unit may also allow a user to keep track of where
they park.            In one aspect the motorist unit may include or be used
in conjunction with a global positioning system or other mapping
data       to   provide        a   user        with   traffic        information         related        to  the
parking spaces so that the user can select, for example a parking
lot      exit     or    street        that      is  not      congested         with   vehicles         leaving
parking spaces monitored by the distributed                                    remote sensing system.
 [0020]            As     noted        above       the      central         controller         101     may   be
connected to the one or more gateways                              110A-110C       (and to the sensing
devices)          in    any      suitable          manner.          In     one   aspect       one     or   more
communicators 140 may be used as a communication link between the
gateways          110A-110C         and       the   central        controller        101.        The    one  or
more communication links 140 may include, for example, one or more
cell       towers/providers                in    a  cellular         communication           network.        In
other aspects the one or more communication links 140 may include,
for example, one or more satellites                                in a      satellite communication
network, a public switched telephone network, Internet/World Wide
Web access points or any other suitable communication access points
such       as    those      used       in     the   wired        and/or       wireless      communication
protocols described above.                         In still other aspects the one or more
communication              links        140     may    be     a    combination        of     cellular       and
satellite          communication               or  any     other      suitable      wired      or     wireless
communication link.
 [0021]            Referring also to Fig. 2, each of the gateways 110A-110C
may include any suitable housing 299 having any suitable shape and
size.         In     one    aspect        the     housing       is   weatherproof          and may be        UV
                                                           8

(ultraviolet) ray resistant.        The housing 299 may be     constructed
of any suitable material so that, in one aspect, radio frequencies
are allowed to pass through the housing.          Each gateway 110A-110C
(generally referred to as gateway 110) may include, e.g. within a
respective housing, a processor module 200         (which may include any
suitable memory and suitable programming and may be configured for
performing the functions of the gateway as described herein),           GPS
module 201,   a clock module 204,      a charge controller 205,    a power
supply module 202 and any suitable number of communication modules
203,  208.
[0022]      The  GPS  module   201  may   be  operably   connected  to  the
processor   module   200  and  include    any  suitable   antenna  209  for
communicating with one or more GPS satellites.          The GPS module 201
may be configured to provide any suitable data to the processor
module   including,   but  not limited to location/positioning        data,
date  data and time data.       The   clock module   204 may be operably
connected to the processor module         200 and provide the processor
module   200 with time    data which may be periodically        (or at any
suitable time(s))    updated by the processor module 200 using date
and/or time data obtained from the GPS module 201.
[0023]      The charge controller 205 may be operably connected to
the processor module 200.        One or more solar panels       207 may be
disposed on, located remotely from or otherwise connected to the
housing 299.    In one aspect, the one or more solar panels 207 may
be movable and configured in any suitable manner to track one or
more available light sources, such as e.g. the best light source,
to optimize a recharge cycle of the one or more power storage units
206.   Here the one or more solar panels may include any suitable
motors and light sensors for effecting light tracking movement of
the one or more solar panels.       As may be realized, the motors and
                                      9

light sensors may be connected to the processor module 200 for any
necessary       calculations          and     control     for      effecting        the     light
tracking movements.              In   other     aspects    the     solar      panels    207    may
include a processor for performing the necessary calculations to
effect the light        tracking movement.              The solar panels 207 may be
operably connected to the               charge controller 205               for charging one
or more rechargeable power storage units 206.                             In one aspect the
gateway 110 may be configured to operate substantially from power
provided      by   the   one      or   more     solar    panels       207     during    lighted
conditions       (e.g.   during       the     day)   and    substantially          from     power
provided by the one or more rechargeable power storage units 206
during      unlighted    or    low    light     conditions        (e.g.      at  night,     dusk,
dawn, etc.).         In other aspects the gateway                  110 may be configured
to operate from power provided by a combined output of the one or
more solar panels 207 and the one or more power storage units 206.
In   still    other aspects         the     gateways    may    be    powered      with    a   hard
line     such as from a utility          source and include suitable              electronics
for    converting     the   utility       power to power         that      is   usable    by the
gateway.
 [0024]        The  power    supply       202   may be    operably         connected      to    the
processor unit 200 and the one or more power storage units 206 to
provide and manage power from the one or more power storage units
206 and/or solar panels 207 for the operation of the gateway 110.
In   one    aspect,   the power        supply module        202     may provide       a    charge
status of the one or more power storage units 206 to the processor
module 200.        The processor module 200 may be configured,                       e.g.     when
the charge status       reaches a predetermined threshold or at any other
suitable time, to effect operation of the charge controller 205 so
that power is transmitted from the one or more solar panels 207 to
the one or more power              storage     units   206    for     charging     the one       or
more     power   storage    units       206.     The   power     supply       module    202    may
                                                10

also      provide        predictive       maintenance         that      monitors,        for    example,
the charge cycles of the one or more power storage units 206.                                          The
processor module 200 may be configured to determine or otherwise
predict       a    life      of the     one or more power              storage     units      206   using
data      from,       for    example,     the     power    supply         module    202,      such   as   a
voltage/current               curve of the one or more solar panels                          207 and/or
the charge cycles of the one or more power storage units 206.                                          The
processor module 200 may cause a message                               (including a status/life
of the one            or more     power    storage       units       206)    to be    sent      from the
gateway 110 to the central controller 101 for communication to any
suitable        operator/maintenance                 personnel         of   the    vehicle        parking
meter system 100.
 [0025]           In       one    aspect      the       gateway         110     may      include       two
communication modules 203, 208.                         One of the communication modules
203     may be        a   "local"     communication         module         configured       for,    e.g.,
communication              with    respective         sensing       devices       120A-120C,        121A
121C,       122A-122C          over    any   suitable       wireless         protocol        such    as   a
cellular,          satellite        or   other      long    or     short     range     communication
protocol.             Another       of   the    communication             modules     208     may   be    a
"distant" communication module configured for, e.g.,                                   communication
with the one or more communicators 140 using, for example, antenna
211      as   will       be    described      in     greater        detail      below.         In   other
aspects,        a     single     communicator          may   be     used     to   communicate        with
both the        sensing devices            120A-120C,        121A-121C,          122A-122C and the
one or more communicators 140.
 [0026]           In one aspect any suitable antenna 210 may be connected
to the       communication           module      203    for   allowing         any   suitable       radio
frequency communication with the sensing devices 120A-120C, 121A
121C,       122A-122C.            The    antenna       210   may       be   disposed       within      the
housing 299, mounted to or remotely located from the housing 299.
                                                      11

In one aspect the antenna 210 may be a directional antenna that is
rotatable/swivelable to point in the direction of a sensing device
120A-120C, 121A-121C, 122A-122C for transmitting information to or
receiving          information              from       the    sensing    device      120A-120C,       121A
121C,        122A-122C.                The       directional         antenna     may     improve      gains
received by the gateway 110 by directing                               the antenna at the sensing
devices 120A-120C, 121A-121C, 122A-122C. In one aspect the antenna
210 may be mounted on a rotatable mount and include any suitable
drive      motor        for    rotating           the     antenna.      The processor module 200
may     include         a   memory         that      is    configured     to    store    a   directional
orientation            of     the     antenna          210   for    each  of    the    sensing     devices
120A-120C,            121A-121C,            122A-122C         communicating        with    the   gateway.
This      directional             orientation             for   each   sensing     device     120A-120C,
121A-121C,            122A-122C          may       be     established     using      a  line    of    sight
alignment while in other aspects the directional orientation may
be substantially               automatically established and/or fine-tuned using
a signal strength of a sensing device communication.                                        For example,
the     processor           unit      200       may     use   the    antenna     210   to    monitor     the
signal        strength         of messages              coming     from the     sensing      devices     and
adjust       the      directional             orientation         of the antenna         210   so   that   a
maximum         or     best       possible           signal      strength    is    obtained       and    the
directional             orientation              for      the    respective       sensing     device      is
stored in memory.                    Adjustments            to the directional orientation of
the antenna 210 may be made as necessary by the gateway 110.                                              In
one aspect,           upon installation                 of a new or additional sensing device
120A-120C, 121A-121C, 122A-122C the gateway 110 may be configured
to automatically                 detect         the     new   or additional        sensing     device     by
sweeping          the      antenna          210     through       the   operational        area    of    the
gateway and record the directional orientation of the antenna 210
for communicating with the new or additional sensing device based
on the signal              strength of a message transmitted from that new or
                                                            12

additional sensing device. In other aspects the antenna 210 may be
an omnidirectional antenna.
 [0027]           Referring to Fig. 3 each sensing device 120A-120C, 121A
121C, 122A-122C in the groups 120,                   121, 122 of sensing devices may
be substantially similar to sensing device 400.                               In one aspect the
sensing         device   400   may  include       any     suitable        housing       401.    The
housing 401 may have any suitable shape and be constructed of any
suitable material so that in one aspect the sensing device may be
placed         or    otherwise     embedded         at     least        partly        within    the
ground/roadway          of   a  parking    space       (e.g.       substantially          below  or
substantially          even with or     substantially             above      a   driving    surface
of the parking space).              In another aspect the housing 401 may be
configured for placement above ground at any suitable location for
sensing vehicles           in a respective parking space.                        The housing 401
may     be    configured     to house    components          of    the    sensing      device   400
such as a processor 402, memory 403                     (which is        suitably configured
along with the processor 402 to effect the operational aspects of
the sensing devices as described herein),                        sensor system clock 406,
a    sensor       power   system,    a   sensor       communication              system    and  any
suitable        vehicle detection sensors.             In   one aspect the sensor power
system may include a power supply and management unit 404 that is
connected to the processor 402.                Any suitable           power storage unit(s)
405 may be          connected to the power supply and management unit 404
for supplying power to the              components of the sensing device 400.
The     power      supply   and   management        unit      404    may      be   configured    to
regulate and distribute power from the power storage units 405 in
any     suitable      manner,    such  as   under the          control         of the    processor
402.       The sensor communication system may include a communication
module 407 (which may be any suitable                   radio frequency communication
module)        connected to the processor             402     and an associated antenna
408.       The antenna 408 may be any suitable antenna such as                               in one

aspect        an    omnidirectional             antenna       and     in      another           aspect       a
directional          antenna.         Where       the    antenna       408      is     a    directional
antenna suitable motors or other solid state or mechanical drive
unit      may    be   provided        for    swiveling        or    otherwise            rotating        the
antenna         so   that      a   signal         strength       of     a     received            or    sent
communication          is    maximized       in    a   manner     substantially               similar      to
that     described        above    with     respect       to   the    gateway          110      (Fig.    2).
The vehicle detection sensors may be any suitable                               vehicle detection
sensors        including       but    not     limited       to   radar        sensor(s)            409   and
magnetometer(s)            414.      The magnetometer            414    and      radar        sensor     409
may be connected to the processor 402                          in any suitable manner and
be     configured         to    sense     a    vehicle       individually              (e.g.       operate
separately -         the processor may use either the radar sensor 409 or
the magnetometer to              sense the vehicle),              in conjunction with each
other       (e.g. operate together),                or according to any predetermined
sequence of operation.                 For example, the radar sensor 409 may be
used     to    verify     the    sensing      activity       of    the magnetometer                  414   or
vice versa.           As may be realized any suitable ancillary circuitry
may     be    provided       to   allow     communication           of    one       or    more      of   the
vehicle       sensors      409, 414 with the processor 402.                          For example, a
digital to analog convertor 412                       and/or a gain control and signal
compensation          module     411 may        be provided         for    communications               from
the      processor        402     to   the       radar     sensor        409       while        a    signal
conditioning module 410 and analog to digital convertor 413 may be
provided         for   communication            from     the    radar       sensor         409      to   the
processor 402.
 [0028]          Referring again to Fig.               1 and Fig.      4,   in     operation,         there
may be groups of gateways 300-302 each having one or more gateways
110A-110C,           310A-C,        300D-310F           where       each         gateway            is     in
communication           with      the     central        controller           101       through,         for
example,        one   or more      communicators           140 which        in     this       aspect     are
                                                    14

cellular providers 140A, 140B, 140C.                 Using gateway group 300 and
associated      sensing     device    groups     120-122    as   an example,           several
levels of redundancy may be provided for communication within the
vehicle parking meter system 100.                As will be explained in greater
detail below there may be one level of redundancy with respect to
communication       between      the    sensing     devices      within       the      sensing
device    groups    120-122     and the     gateways     110A-110C.          There may be
another     level    of   redundancy     between      communications          between       the
gateways      110A-110C     and   the   communicators        140A-140C.           There     may
also be a level of redundancy with respect to communications                               from
the sensing devices where sensing device messages are stored within
a gateway 110A-110C when one or more gateways and the communicators
140A-140C are unavailable.
 [0029]       As   noted    above,    each    gateway     110A-110C        may    be     paired
with its own group 120,           121,   122 of sensing devices.               The sensing
devices      120A-120C,       121A-121C,       122A-122C     may     be     any      suitable
sensing      devices      such    as    those     described        in      United        States
Provisional       Patent    Applications        having    U.S.    provisional            patent
application       numbers     61/824,512      and  61/824,630       filed      on     May   17,
2013     (now    United      States    non-Provisional          Patent       Applications
respectively       having     attorney     docket    numbers      1195P014931-US(PAR)
and 1195P014933-US (PAR)         and filed     on May 19,     2014),     the disclosures
of which are incorporated herein by reference in                     their     entireties.
In   one    aspect    the    sensing    devices     may    detect      the    arrival       and
departure       of  vehicles      within      associated       parking        spaces.       For
example,     as noted above,      one or more sensing devices may be located
 (e.g. such as      embedded in the road surface or otherwise) in each
parking space monitored by the vehicle parking meter system 100.
Each gateway 11OA-110C in the group of gateways 300 may provide a
redundancy for communication with the                  sensing device groups               120
122.     In    one  aspect     the   gateways     may   be   arranged        or    otherwise
                                             15

positioned         throughout       a   deployment       area   of    the   vehicle     parking
meter       system      100    so   that      each    sensing     device     is   capable       of
communicating with at least two gateways.                         As an example, gateway
110A may be paired as a primary gateway with sensing devices 120A
120C within           sensing device        group 120      (e.g.   that    define a     primary
sensing device           group     for gateway       110A)   and paired as        a  secondary
gateway with sensing devices within sensing device groups 121, 122
 (e.g.     that     define     secondary        sensing     device      groups   for    gateway
110A).          Gateway     110B    may     be   paired    as  a    primary     gateway       with
sensing       devices      121A-121C       within     sensing    device     group    121     (e.g.
that      define a primary          sensing device        group    for gateway       110B)     and
paired as a secondary gateway with the sensing devices of sensing
device groups 120,            122    (e.g. that define secondary sensing device
groups for gateway 110B).                  Gateway 110C may be paired as a primary
gateway with sensing devices 122A-122C within sensing device group
122      (e.g.   that    define     a primary       sensing device        group   for gateway
110C)      and paired       as   a   secondary      gateway    with      sensing    devices     in
sensing device groups 120, 121                   (e.g. that define secondary sensing
device groups for gateway 110C).
 [0030]          It is noted that a primary gateway is the gateway given
priority        when     communicating         with    a   respective       primary      sensing
device group.             Secondary       gateways     are   configured      to   communicate
with their        secondary sensing device groups when the primary gateway
for those secondary sensing device groups is                       unavailable.        In    other
words,      each gateway 110A-110C in              the group of gateways 300 provides
each      sensing device in           each primary sensing device group with a
redundant        gateway      (e.g.    if    one   of the    gateways      11OA-110C      in   the
group of gateways 300 is unavailable the other gateways 11OA-110C
within that         group of gateways are configured to allow communication
with the sensing devices associated with the unavailable gateway).
For example, if gateway 110A is unavailable, either one of gateway
                                                  16

110B or gateway 110C allows communication with the sensing devices
of   sensing device group                  120.    Each      gateway         110A-110C within the
group       may    be   prioritized          with     each      other       with     respect       to     the
redundant         communication.              The   prioritization                for   communication
with a sensing device within a                      sensing device group 120-122 with
a   secondary        gateway         (e.g.   which     secondary           gateway     is   chosen        for
communication and in what sequence) may be based on a proximity of
a   secondary        gateway        to the primary           sensing        device     group      for     the
unavailable          gateway         (e.g.   so  that      the       least     amount     of    power      is
used by the sensing devices when communicating with the secondary
gateway) or based on any other suitable criteria.                                       In one aspect
the gateways 110A-110C are configured to listen for messages                                             from
the     sensing        devices          (e.g.   primary         sensing        devices,       secondary
sensing       devices       or both)        and   when     a    message        is   received        from a
sensing device that message is acknowledged by the gateway so that
there      is   an   indication          sent back to         the       sensing     device      that      the
message       was    received         by the    gateway.         If     the   sensing     device         does
not     receive       an   acknowledgement            message          the    sensing     device         then
proceeds         to    communicate          with     each       of      the    secondary        gateways
according         to    the      gateway      prioritization               until      an   operational
gateway acknowledges the sensing device message.
[0031]           In    one     aspect      the   gateways           110A-110C       may    be    able      to
communicate with each other and provide health and welfare messages
to each other regarding an operational state of the gateway.                                               If
one     gateway      receives         a   message     from      another        gateway     that       it   is
unavailable          for     communication          with      its        primary      sensing        device
group the         gateway receiving that message may listen for messages
from the primary sensing device group for the unavailable gateway.
The    health       and welfare           message     may also           be   sent    to  the     central
controller          200    for      system    management            and     monitoring       where        any
                                                    17

unavailability               in     the    system        may        be     addressed        by    maintenance
personnel.
 [0032]            As     noted      above      and      still         referring         to   Fig.       4,    each
gateway        may       also    be    configured           to     communicate           with     the     central
controller           101      (Fig.    1)    through         one      or more          communicators          140A
140C      which       in    this     aspect        may    be      cellular         providers.           Cellular
provider         as     used     herein      may      refer        to    a    cellular       network        access
point        and/or       cellular        carrier.              In     other       aspects      any     suitable
communication protocols may be used as mentioned above,                                              where each
form of communication has one or more access points available to
the gateway groups                  300-302.          In still other aspects each gateway
may     be     connected           to   one     or     more        communicators             140A-140C         over
different communication protocols.                                For example, gateways in group
300      may       be     connected         to      communicator                140A     over      a    cellular
connection, connected to communicator 140B over a public switched
telephone network and connected to communicator 140C over a network
connection such as the World Wide Web.                                        Each gateway group 300
302     may     be     associated         or    otherwise            paired        with    a   predetermined
 (e.g. a primary) one of the communicators 140A-140C.                                            For example,
the pairing between the communicators 140A-140C and each group of
gateways 300-301 may be based on, for example, proximity                                                 (e.g. so
the least amount of power may be used for communication) between
each      group       of     gateways       and      the      cellular          provider       or    any     other
suitable        criteria.            As may be realized,                  one communicator             140A-140C
may serve as a primary cellular provider for more than one gateway
group.         Still using gateway group 300 as an example, each gateway
110A-110C           may      be     capable        of    communicating                 with   at     least       two
cellular providers to provide another level of redundancy in the
vehicle        parking         meter      system       100.          As    an     example,      referring         to
Fig.      4,    if     a   gateway        110A-110C           in    sensing         device     group        300   is
paired with communicator 140A as                               a primary communicator and with
                                                          18

one      or     more    of    the      communicators           140B,   140C       as      secondary
communicators           (Fig.    5,    Block      500)    which    may  be    prioritized         for
access in a manner similar to that described above with respect to
the gateway access by the sensing devices                         (e.g. based on proximity
so that       the gateway chooses the closest available cellular                            provider
so that the lowest power is used by the gateway for communication
with the cellular provider, preference of communication protocol
- e.g. wired or wireless,                etc.) .      In  one aspect,     the gateways          110A
110C       may    be    configured          to    determine       the  proximity            of   each
communicator          140A-140C       to    the     gateway    110A-110C      and      communicate
with the closest available communicator 140A-140C to effect power
consumption efficiency of the gateway                         110A-110C.        Preference may
be    given to       the   communicator           140A by    the gateway        110A-110C        when
communicating with the central controller                        101.   If   the communicator
140A         is    unavailable            the       gateway       110A-110C          may       switch
communications to communicate with a secondary communicator 140B,
140C      according       to    any     suitable        predetermined       priority          of  the
secondary cellular providers until an available provider is                                     found
 (Fig.      5,   Block     510)     (e.g.       the    gateway    may   look      for      the   best
communication between the gateway and a communicator) .                                   As may be
realized the gateway may be configured to receive an acknowledgment
message          from      the       communicator           140A-140C          and        if     that
acknowledgement message is not received the gateway 110A-110C may
then proceed to communicate with the other cellular providers.
 [0033]          In another aspect the gateway                   110A-110C may not             switch
communicators           140A-140C         if      its    primary     communicator            becomes
unavailable where the gateway                      110A-110C is      configured to wait to
re-establish         communication with its              primary communicator             140A-140C
 (Fig. 5, Block 520).                In one aspect the gateway 110A-110C may be
configured to wait a predetermined length of time before switching
between communicators               140A-140C.           Here,   there   may     be a       level  of
                                                    19

redundancy with respect to communications from the sensing devices
where       sensing      device      messages    are   stored within         a    gateway       110A
110C one or more communicators 140A-140C are unavailable.                                      In one
aspect,         using      gateway      110A    as   an   example,       gateway          110A     may
establish         communication         with  communicator        140A    (which may be the
primary communicator for gateway 110A) .                        If the communicator 140A
becomes unavailable the gateway may store messages from the one or
more      of    the   sensing      device    groups    120-122      (e.g.     primary        sensing
devices        and/or      secondary      sensing devices)        within a memory             of the
gateway        110A     (Fig.    5,    Block  530) .     The    gateway      may monitor           the
availability           of    the    primary    communicator        140A    and     transmit        the
stored messages when the gateway 110A re-establishes                              communication
with the primary communicator                    140A.    Each message           stored by the
gateway 110A is given a time stamp indicating when the message was
received         by the      gateway     110A   so that,      for example,          the arrival,
departure, violation, and other messages                        from the sensing devices
can     be     accurately       tracked     and    applied     to   user     accounts         by   the
central controller              101.    When communication is          re-established             with
the communicator 140A the gateway 110A transmits the message with
the time stamp to allow the central controller 101 to monitor the
activity of the corresponding parking spaces                          (Fig. 5, Block 540).
Where         one    or     more      gateways      110A-110C       are     unavailable            and
communication              with      the    communicators          140A-140C           cannot        be
established the sensing devices will communicate with the primary
and secondary gateways 110A-110C until an available gateway                                      (e.g.
referred to herein as a store forward gateway) is                             found.         In this
case      only the       store     forward    gateway    will     store    the      time     stamped
messages until communication is re-established with either another
gateway        or   at   least    one    of the    communicators        140A-140C           (Fig.    5,
Block 550) .         In   one aspect if      the messages are stored in               a secondary
gateway and communication is                   re-established with the primary                      (or
other        optimal)       gateway     the   secondary       gateway     may      transfer        the
                                                  20

messages        (Fig.      5,   Block       560)       to    the      primary          gateway     for
transmission to the central controller 101.                              If the communicators
are unavailable after the transfer of the messages to the primary
gateway       the    primary       gateway          may    store        the      messages        until
communication         is     re-established            with    the       communicators.             In
another aspect, the secondary gateway may transfer the messages to
the central       controller       when      communication         is     re-established          with
one or more the communicators                    140A-140C.       In still another aspect
if there are no available gateways 110A-110C the                                  sensing devices
120A-120C, 121A-121C, 122A-122C time stamp and store the messages
and      send   to   stored      messages          when    one    or       more       gateways     re
establishes communication with the sensing devices.
 [0034]        In a manner similar to that described above between the
gateways      110A-110C       and   the     communicators         140A-140C,             the   sensing
devices 400       (Fig.    3)  are paired with a primary gateway and at least
one     secondary    gateway       (Fig.      6,   Block    600),      e.g.      in    a   respective
gateway group or in another gateway group, in any suitable manner.
For      example,     the     sensing        devices       400    may       be      configured      to
automatically determine which gateway is to be the primary gateway
based      on    any      suitable        criteria,         such       as      for       example,      a
communication         signal      strength         between     the        sensing         device   and
gateway     and/or      a distance       between       the sensing          device and gateway
 (e.g. based on GPS information provided by the gateway) .                                    In other
aspects      the    primary      gateway         may    be   manually          selected        in  any
suitable      manner,     such as through line            of sight.          The sensing device
400     may be   configured       to    switch       communications            from the        primary
gateway       to   a     secondary         gateway        (Fig.       6,      Block        610)   when
communication         between       the       primary      gateway          and      one     or   more
communicators        is    unavailable          and/or    when the         primary        gateway   is
unavailable       or    when   communications            with   the primary              gateway   are
crowded.       For    example,      referring         to Fig.     4,     the     sensing       devices
                                                  21

122A-122C       in   sensor    group      122      may    be   paired    with    one    of     the
gateways 110A-110C as a primary gateway and be paired with other
ones   of gateways        110A-110C       and/or       gateways     310A-310E     of   gateway
groups     301,    302  as  secondary gateways.                Selection of a secondary
gateway     by    the   sensing    device       400    can be     based   on   any    suitable
priority or criteria similar to that described above with respect
to   the     gateways      selecting        secondary          communicators        (e.g.      the
sensing     device     may   look    for the         best     communication      between       the
sensing device and the gateway).                    In other aspects where there are
no gateways available the sensing devices 400 may be configured to
time stamp and store any suitable parking data in the memory 403
(Fig.   6,   Block 620)     and transmit the stored data when communication
a gateway 110 is re-established                    (Fig. 6, Block 630).
[0035]         In one aspect each gateway                  110A-110C communicates with
their respective          sensing devices           120A-120C,      121A-121C,       122A-122C
over any suitable wired or wireless communication interface                                 (that
e.g. may be substantially similar to that described above between
the gateways        and the communicators)              in    a time division       duplexing
(TDD) manner using a pseudo random channel sequence.                            For example,
the sensing devices 400 may initiate a message                         (e.g. that includes
data embodying a status of a parking space being monitored and/or
a  health      and     maintenance       status        of    the   sensing     device)       that
requires      or   otherwise     results        in   a   response     from   a   gateway       110
(either primary or secondary gateway),                        and "sleeps"      or otherwise
removes     itself from active engagement with the gateway 110 until
the sensing device 400 determines that it is time to ready itself
for communication with the gateway 110.                        In one aspect the gateway
110   and    the    sensing    device      400     may    communicate     over    a   wireless
communication          link    where      the       transmission        of   messages          and
responses       can    be   sent    over      any      of   a   plurality      of   available
transmission frequencies. Frequency hopping is used to the extent
                                                 22

that transmissions of information and receptions                                  of communicated
information       take      place      according           to     sequences     of   communication
frequencies.        In     a    frequency          hopping         system,     the   communication
frequencies       do   not      remain       constant,         but     rather   are   changed        over
time   and/or      in     connection           with      triggering          events    in   order       to
continually        change          the       frequency           in     which     information           is
communicated.
[0036]        In   one     aspect,       at     least      one     frequency     hopping      sequence
is  shared       and     substantially               synchronized          between      the    sensing
devices 400 and the gateways 110.                           In a frequency hopping system,
response timing and coordination is not a trivial consideration.
Responses to messages may not be formulated at the gateway 110 at
any specific      time,       but rather response formulation can be completed
at  any    time    relative         to     the     currently          active    frequency       in    the
frequency     hopping         sequence.         Thus,      the     sensing device        400 may not
be able to expect to receive a response at some certain time.                                           If
the   sensing       device         400     listened           for    a    response(s)       at     every
frequency      of the        frequency         hopping        sequence,       the   sensing      device
400  would      need      to      continually          attempt        to    receive     and    process
information.         Such       continual          monitoring           requires,      among       other
things, significant processing resources and involves                                     significant
power   consumption.             This     is     particularly            troublesome       where      the
sensing     device     400     is   battery        powered,         as valuable      limited power
resources may be unnecessarily wasted.
[0037]        The sensing device 400 and gateway 110 share a frequency
hopping sequence. For example, each of the sensing device 400 and
gateway 110 may synchronously step through each of the frequencies
of the frequency hopping sequence to know which frequency is                                     active
for  communications            at   a   given time.            Any manner        of  synchronizing
such a shared frequency hopping sequence(s)                              may be used.       In   normal
                                                      23

operation the frequencies of the frequency hopping sequence may be
considered to recycle in a continuous loop.
[0038]         In   one      embodiment,        the    active     frequency      in    which       a
message     is     to     be   transmitted         by   the     sensing      device      400    is
determined by for example,              the processor 402          (Fig. 4) . For example,
the  processor        402     may   store     or     otherwise      access    the    frequency
hopping     sequence,          and    may    also      store     the    last    transmission
frequency that was used to send a message. By knowing the sequence
and the    last used transmission                frequency, the sensing device                 400
can readily identify the next transmission frequency to use in the
frequency       hopping       sequence.      In     aspects,     the    frequency      that     is
currently active,          or active at some future time                (e.g. the frequency
after the currently active frequency),                     may be used to transmit the
message.        In   still      other    aspects,       any   manner      of  determining          a
frequency in which to transmit the message may be used.
[0039]        Not    only may the         frequency hopping sequence be used to
determine at which frequency messages will be transmitted, in one
aspect   it      may    be    used    to    monitor      for    incoming      messages.        For
example,      the    sensing       devices       400   may    know     which   frequency        to
monitor, and at what time and/or for what duration. The processor
402 may be used to determine when each of the frequencies                                 in the
frequency      hopping       sequence     is    to become      the     active   frequency       in
which to monitor for incoming signals                    (e.g. response signals)            from,
for example the gateway 110.                 In one aspect, the processor 402 may
determine       when      the    same    frequency        at   which      the   message        was
transmitted will reoccur in the frequency hopping sequence.                                 As an
example, the processor 402 may calculate a time duration based on
at  least      the    number       of   frequencies         in    the    frequency      hopping
sequence,     the order        (sequence)      of the frequencies,           and a time slot
duration     in    which      each   of   the     frequencies       is   active,    until      the
                                                 24

same      frequency      used     to transmit           the message        arises       again     in   the
sequence.           In one aspect the processor 402 may use the clock 406
to     count      out    the    calculated            time   duration         to     know     when     the
frequency will again become active in the sequence.
[0040]           In   one    aspect        the     processor      402    can    be    configured         to
cause one or more functional                       components        403-414 to enter a              sleep
mode during the calculated time interim between occurrences of the
relevant frequency.                 In one aspect the sensing devices 400 enter
a   sleep mode        after     transmitting            a  respective        message.          This may
occur       immediately       following           message    transmission,            or   after      some
other event(s)           such as         receiving       a message       acknowledgement            or at
any suitable time after receiving or sending a message. The sleep
mode may involve reducing and/or suspending one or more functional
operations          and/or    device        components       to     conserve        local    resources
such      as   processing       power,         battery     power,       etc.       For    example,       to
conserve power, in one aspect the sensing devices 400 may enter a
sleep        mode    after     sending           a   message      and     receiving         a    message
acknowledgement from a gateway                        110.     In another aspect, entering
such      a   sleep mode      after        transmitting         a message        to   a   gateway       110
without receiving a response from the gateway as the response from
the gateway 110 may not be                      immediately provided such as when the
gateway is unavailable.
[0041]           In    one    aspect,          each     gateway       110A-110C        may     transmit
continuously using TDD and may be capable of changing communication
channels/frequencies                 (it     is     noted   that       the   terms       channel       and
frequency          are      used      interchangeably             herein)         according         to     a
predetermined           channel/frequency                switching/hopping             scheme        (e.g.
channel hopping as described above) .                        It   is    noted that       each gateway
may have a respective channel/frequency switching scheme that is
different         from    the    channel/frequency               switching         scheme      of    other
                                                      25

gateways.          The gateway 110 may hop between any suitable number of
frequencies when communicating with the                        sensing devices              400 over
any     suitable frequency band.                In one aspect, as             an example, the
gateway 110 may hop between 50                   frequencies over a frequency band
of     902     Mhz    to   928   Mhz   while      in    other     aspects       the      number        of
frequencies may be more or less than 50 and the frequency band may
be    higher or lower          than   902 Mhz       to   928 Mhz.          In one aspect with
each       channel      change,   an   outgoing       message       is    transmitted           by    the
gateway         110A-110C      and   then     the     gateway      110A-110C         listens          for
response messages             from the respective sensing devices                        120A-120C,
121A-121C,         122A-122C.      As such,     at any given time the gateway 110A
110C       is  communicating       with    each     of the     respective         (e.g.       primary
and      secondary)        sensing    devices       120A-120C,         121A-121C,         122A-122C
over      a   common     communication       channel.        In one aspect            the channel
rate       change may be,        for example,         approximately          100   mSec       and the
outgoing message from the gateway 110A-110C may use approximately
40%     of the channel communication window allowing for long sensing
device response times.                In other aspects the channel rate change
may be any suitable            time interval         (e.g. more or less than 100 mSec)
and the        outgoing message        may use any         suitable         percentage          of the
channel communication window.                    The processor module 200                    (Fig. 2)
of    each      gateway      110A-110C    may     be    configured         with    any       suitable
number        of   channel     hopping     sequences        such       as   for   example,            256
channel hopping sequences.                 Each gateway may also be assigned any
suitable address identifier such as,                     for example, a 16 bit address
identifier that is unique to each gateway 110A-110C.                                Each gateway
110A-110C         may     be   configured       to     broadcast        its    unique         address
identifier          in,    for   example,      the     outgoing        message      so     that       the
sensing devices may listen              for the address identifier                and determine
which         gateway      110A-110C      they       can    communicate          with.              Once
communication is            established between the gateway 110A-110C and the
respective           sensing     device(s)        120A-120C,           121A-121C,         122A-122C
                                                 26

predetermined parameters of the gateway                             (such as,       e.g.,    the address
identifier          and    channel       hopping       sequence)        that      are    needed by         the
sensing devices for communication with the gateway may be updated
at    any     suitable        time      such     as   on   an    as    needed       basis      or     at   any
suitable predetermined time frequency.
 [0042]           In    one    aspect        the  gateway       110A-110C         may    be    configured
for adaptive channel/frequency hopping so that                                 a channel is          changed
and/or       avoided        when,     for      example,       an   error      rate      for    particular
channels         exceeds        a  predetermined           error       rate     threshold.             As   an
example, if there is a frequency jam or other error the gateway is
configured           to   select      a    new    channel/frequency             to     be  used       in   the
hopping        sequence.           It     is    noted    that      in   one     aspect       all      of   the
gateways in a gateway group transmit messages substantially at the
same       time      and     listen        for    messages        from       the     sensing         devices
substantially              at     the      same     time      to,      for     example,          reduce       a
possibility of self jamming.                         In other aspects any number of the
gateways in the distributed remote sensing system may transmit at
substantially the                same time and listen substantially                         at the        same
time       to,     for     example,          reduce    a    possibility            of    self      jamming.
Similarly it is noted that any suitable number of sensing devices
400     may    communicate          with      the    gateways       at   substantially            the     same
time.        The gateway 110A-110C may send a "next hop index" message
in   every time slot             of the outgoing message such that,                       when compared
to a hop index of the sensing devices 120A-120C,                                     121A-121C, 122A
122C, the next channel being "hopped to" should match in both the
gateway hop sequence index and a sensing device hop sequence index.
In    one    aspect        several       spare      channels      known       to both       the      gateway
110A-110C          and   their      respective         sensing        devices       120A-120C,           121A
121C,       122A-122C        may    be    available.           The    gateway       110A-110C may be
configured to dynamically direct the sensing devices to select the
                                                      27

spare     channel,        if   that       spare    channel      is    a  valid      spare    for   the
particular channel hopping sequence.
 [0043]         In    one    aspect,       as  noted above,          the sensing         devices   400
may   be    configured         to     sleep    or    otherwise        deactivate        one  or  more
components to,            for example, conserve power.                     As may be realized,
when    communicating           with       the  pseudo      random      channel        sequence    the
frequencies          of the sensing devices 400 and the gateways 110 must
match for communication to occur between the two.                                   In one aspect,
a sensing device 400 may sleep for a predetermined period of time
 (Fig.   7,    Block      700)    and when       the     sensing device          400 wakes      up it
must    synchronize          with     the    hopping      frequency       of    the    gateway   110.
Here the sensing device 400 is                       configured to track the period of
time the sensing device has been asleep                             (e.g. the sleep time) in
any suitable         manner such as by using,               e.g.,     the sensor system clock
406    (Fig.      7,    Block     710)      and   is    configured       upon     waking     to  look
forward an amount of time substantially equal to the sleep time,
e.g.   to compensate for the sleep time,                       (Fig.    7,   Block 720)       so that
the frequencies of the sensing device 400 and the gateway 110 are
synchronized for communication                       (e.g. the sensing device picks the
active frequency of the channel hopping sequence upon waking from
sleep)      substantially           immediately          upon   waking       so   that     real  time
data may be provided by the sensing device 400                             (Fig.    7,   Block 730).
In   one     aspect       to   facilitate         the     frequency        synchronization         the
frequency hopping scheme of one or more gateways 110 may be stored
within,      for example,           the memory         403   of    the  sensing        devices   400.
In  one     aspect       the   frequency        hopping      scheme     and/or       sensor    system
clock may be updated and in the case of the clock 406 synchronized
with the clock 204 of the gateway at any suitable time intervals
when     communication            is      established       between        the    primary      and/or
secondary        gateways       and      the   sensing      devices.         In   one     aspect   the
sensor system clock 406 may be synchronized with the gateway clock
                                                     28

204 at every transmission from the gateway                           (e.g. a current time of
the     gateway      is    sent      to  the   sensing        devices     substantially        every
time the gateway sends a transmission to the sensing devices).
 [0044]          In one aspect the interface between the gateways 110 and
the respective            sensing devices           400 may allow for a              remote   change
in     configuration          and/or      updating        of   any   suitable        predetermined
characteristic            of    the     sensing     devices      400.        In   one    aspect  the
predetermined           characteristic         may     include     a   firmware version,         one
or     more     of  a    frequency        hopping       sequence      for     the    communication
interface,         days      of     sensing    device        operation,        hours     of  sensing
device         operation,          a    radar     sensor        strength,        a     magnetometer
sensitivity, and a magnetometer calibration.                                As may be       realized
the      configuration           updates      of    each      sensing      device       400  may  be
effected from, for example, the central controller 101                                   (Fig. 1) in
any suitable manner                such as automatically or initiated by a user
of the        central     controller.          The      communication          interface between
the sensors 400 and the gateways 110 also allows health and welfare
signals to be shared between the gateways and sensing devices.                                     In
one aspect the sensing devices                      400 may send a health and welfare
message to a respective gateway at any suitable predetermined time
intervals.           For     example,      in    one     aspect    the     health       and  welfare
messages may be sent substantially every 30 minutes while in other
aspects the health and welfare messages may be sent at intervals
that are less than or greater than 30 minutes.                                  In still another
aspect the health and welfare message may also include an occupancy
status      of a respective parking space being monitored by the sensing
device 400.          Where the sensing device is in high traffic areas and
a    high      number      of    occupancy       transitions         within       the     respective
parking space are keeping the sensing device 400 from sleeping the
sensing device            400 may be configured to turn itself off                          (e.g. go
to sleep) to conserve power.                   The gateways 110 may also send health
                                                    29

and welfare messages to the respective sensing devices 400 so that
the sensing devices 400 may switch to a secondary gateway if the
primary gateway is not capable of transmitting messages                         from the
sensing devices to the central controller 101                    (Fig. 1).
[0045]           In accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosed
embodiment a distributed remote                sensing system is provided.             The
distributed        remote    sensing  system includes         at least    one gateway,
at least       one sensing device and a communication interface                providing
radio       frequency     communication    through      a  shared    frequency      scheme
between       each   sensing   device   and one      of the at     least    one   gateway
and between         each   sensing  device     and   another    of the    at  least    one
gateway through a different frequency scheme.
[0046]           In accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosed
embodiment         the   distributed    remote       sensing    system     comprises     a
parking monitoring system.
[0047]           In accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosed
embodiment,           the    communication        interface       further       provides
communication         between   the  at  least      one   gateway    and  a  peripheral
device.
[0048]           In accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosed
embodiment,        communication between the at least            one gateway and the
peripheral device is through a central controller.
[0049]           In accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosed
embodiment,         the   peripheral   device     is   a   handheld     device   and   the
central controller          provides parking space information on a display
of the peripheral device.
