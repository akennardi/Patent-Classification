                                            ELECTRIC FENCE INSULATOR
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0001]            The present invention relates to an electric fence insulator, and in particular, to
an electric fence insulator which is adapted to be installed on or in a fence post, and,
support an electrical fence wire.
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART
[0002]            The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information
derived from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as, an
acknowledgement or admission or any form of suggestion that prior publication (or
information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general
knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates.
[0003]            Electric fences are commonly known to be used in agricultural or other animal
control situations as a barrier to deter animals from crossing a boundary, in security
sensitive installations, and the like. Electric fences are designed to provide an electric
shock to an animal or person, by creating an electric circuit when touched by the person or
animal. A power energizer typically releases an electric pulse along a wire, whilst another
terminal is connected to an earth rod. A person or animal touching both the wire and the
earth during a pulse will complete an electrical circuit to thereby conduct the pulse, which
has the effect of feeling an electric shock.
[0004]            Fence posts are commonly formed of metal material, which of course is
electrically conductive.                  As such, the electrified fence wire must be insulated from the
fence post. Insulators are known to be used in such situations, and take a variety of forms.
Typically, insulators are secured externally to the fence post and protrude therefrom. This
causes havoc in many situations. They are prone to be easily bumped, knocked, or broken
by animals, persons or trees falling.
[0005]            When damage occurs to a fence, for example, if a single fence post is damaged
or destroyed by an animal, fallen tree, or the like, the entire fence wire is often required to

                                                       -2
be restrung, particularly on electric fences, as replacement of a single post and the
insulators associated therewith, is not practical. Such process is labour intensive and time
consuming, and, typically results in wastage of fence wire due to the need for replacement
thereof.

[0006]            The present invention seeks to provide an electric fence insulator which is
adapted to be installed in a fence post and house a fence wire therein which overcomes at

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0037]            Throughout the drawings, like numerals will be used to identify like features,
except where expressly otherwise indicated.
[0038]            As shown in the drawings, an electric fence insulator, generally designated by
the numeral 1, is adapted to be installed in a fence post 10 and house a fence wire 11
therein.
[0039]            The insulator, as shown in Figs. 1 to 6, preferably has a substantially elongate
body 2. The body 2 may be at least partly formed of electrically insulative material. This
facilitates electrically isolating the fence post 10 from the electrified wire 11.
[0040]            The elongate body 2 preferably has an enlarged portion 3 on one end thereof.
This enlarged portion 3 may be in the form of one or more protrusions extending part way
or completely about the elongate body 2, or, as shown in the drawings, may be formed
such that the entire end of the body 2 is of enlarged cross-sectional area relative to the
remainder of the body 2. This shape allows the smaller dimensioned portion of the body 2
to be inserted in a passageway 12 provided within a fence post 10.
[0041]            The enlarged portion 3 extends outwardly of the elongate body 2 so that, as the
insulator is installed in a passageway of a fence post, the enlarged portion 3 abuts the fence

E:hI nfewoenNRPinW1DCC\KMH\ I616634/_1dA-x-19/ 12/20 7
                                                       -6
post 10 at least partly around the periphery of the passageway 12 formed in the fence post
 10, so as to thereafter prevent further movement of the elongate body 2 through the
passageway 12.
[0042]            The insulator 1 includes a bore 4 extending longitudinally between the ends 5
and 6 of the elongate body 2. The bore 4 or passageway is adapted to house a fence wire
 11 therein.
[0043]            The body 2 further includes an elongate slit 7 which extends outwards from the
bore 4 to the outer surface 8 of the insulator 1, as perhaps best illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3.
The slit 7 is adapted to receive a fence wire 11 therein, such that it can be fed therethrough
into its desired position, housed within the bore 4 of the insulator. The slit 7 is shown to be
shaped such that its opening is wide enough for a fence wire to be easily inserted therein.
[0044]            The electric fence insulator I is preferably formed of resilient material, such as
rubber or plastics, and, is preferably of unitary construction.                It will however be
appreciated that the entire insulator 1 need not be formed of such material to provide
appropriate insulative properties between the fence wire 11 and the fence post 10. For
example, just the inner portion of the body 2, surrounding the bore 4, could be formed of
electrically insulative material, such as rubber, and, the remainder of the body 2 could be
formed of a metal or other non-insulative material.
[0045]            By making the insulator 1 of resilient material, such as rubber, and, having a
wedged-shaped slit 7 as shown in the drawings, the insulator may be compressed when
being inserted into the passageway 12 of the fence post 10. After insertion, the insulator
"expands" to its usual size, further assisting in its retention in the passageway 12.
[0046]            The illustrated embodiment shows the insulator 1 of a particular shape which is
non-symmetrical in cross-section. It will however be understood by persons skilled in the
art that a variety of shapes may be embodied. As would be appreciated, a non-symmetrical
shape would provide an advantage that the body would not move/rotate when installed,
however, this may be not be problematic in some situations, and therefore a symmetrically

E:hI nfewoenNRPinW1DCC\KMH\ I616634_1d,1- 19/12/20 7
                                                                -7
shaped body, for example a body of substantially cylindrical shape, could be alternatively
utilized.
[0047]            The longitudinal bore 4 is shown in the illustrated embodiment to be
substantially centrally provided in the body 2. It will however be appreciated that this is
also not strictly necessary.                       That is, the bore 4 could alternatively be provided at any
position within the elongate body and still function appropriately, as will be appreciated by
persons skilled in the art.
[0048]            Figs. 7 to 11 show the electric fence insulator 1 installed within a fence post
 10. As perhaps best illustrated in Fig. 11, each fence post 10 incorporates at least one, but
preferably, a plurality of passageways 12 therethrough, provided spaced apart near the top
of the fence post 10.                     The illustrated embodiment, shown in Figs. 7 and 8 provides
passageways 12 extending angularly adjacent one corner 13 of the fence post 11. That is,
the fence post as shown in Fig. 8 is formed to be of substantially square cross-section
having sides 14 and having rounded corners 13 therebetween.                             The passageway 12 is
formed adjacent one corner of the post, as perhaps best shown in Fig. 8, by cutting an
orifice in each side wall of the post. Passageways can, of course, be provided at any
desired position or angle in a fence post.
[0049]            As will be understood, the insulator 1 may be installed into position during
assembly or construction of a fence. However, in the event that a fence post is required to
be replaced or repaired, for example if it is broken by an animal, a fallen tree, or the like,
the fence post may be readily replaced without re-wiring.                         That is, the insulator of the
present invention enables a fence post in a fence to be replaced, the wire 11 to be inserted
into the slit 7 and moved into position in the bore 4, and then, the insulator device slid into
position through the passageway 12 formed in the fence post 10.
[0050]            The insulator 1 may be retained in position in the passageway 12 by insertion
of a locking member, such as, but not limited to, a retainer 15 which then holds the
insulator I in position in the passageway of the post 10. This retainer 15 may be in the
form of a retaining rod 15 installed from the top open end of the fence post 10 to extend
substantially downwards between the corner 13 of the fence post 10 and the insulator 1,

RhI  ntewoenNRPinW1DCC\KMH\ I616634/_1dA-x-19/ 12/20 7
fitting within the shaped cutout 16 of the insulator, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Alternate
forms of retaining means will be readily appreciated to effectively "lock" the insulator I in
the passageway.
[0051]            An electric fence assembly may therefore be formed by firstly installing a
plurality of fence posts 10 in spaced apart position in a substrate surface. Each fence post
 10 includes at least one passageway 12 already formed therein. The fence wire 11 may
then be strung between the spaced-apart fence posts 10 and then, insulators I are
positioned on/around the fence wire by inserting the fence wire via the slit 7 and into the
bore 4. Then, the insulator body 2 is slid along the fence wire 11, and inserted through a
passageway 12 of the fence post 10 until the enlarged portion 3 abuts the portion of the
post about the periphery or edge of the passageway to prevent further ingress/movement of
the elongate body 2 through the passageway 12. The insulator 1 may then be locked in
position by inserting the retaining rod from the upper portion of the open end of the fence
post 10 and feeding it through the various cutouts 16.
[0052]            As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, the insulators I are
prevented from thereafter falling out or be removed, unless the retaining rod 15 is firstly
removed. Therefore, the insulators 1 are effectively locked into position.
[0053]            It will be appreciated that if one fence post in a fence is destroyed by an animal
or fallen tree, then a new fence post may be installed without having to completely rewire
the fence. The replacement fence post is simply installed in the substrate surface at the
desired location, and then the insulator is retrofitted over the already strung fence wire and
inserted into the new fence post.
[0054]            The electric fence insulator of the present invention may be manufactured in a
variety of forms, including, but not limited to either moulding the insulator such as from
resilient material, and/or, 3D printing the insulator from plastics, rubber or like material. It
will be appreciated that other forms of manufacturing the insulator will be apparent to
persons skilled in the art.
