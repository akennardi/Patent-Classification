ABSTRACT
Provided       is    a  buoy  marker     10    which  comprises     a   housing   12
sealed      against       the  ingress       of   fluid    and   configured      for
operative         fitment   to  a   line     7.   The  marker    10    includes   an
indicator         14   housed   within      the    housing    12   and     which  is
configured to indicate the housing 12 when the indicator 14 is
active. The marker 10 also includes energising means 16 housed
within the housing 12 and configured to energise the indicator
14,    when   in    use.   Further   included      is an ambient     light    sensor
18    for   sensing      ambient   light      around   the   housing      12 and  is
further adapted to activate the                 indicator 14 once the ambient
light     falls below a particular threshold.

TECHNICAL FIELD
 [0001]          This      invention            relates           to     a   buoy      marker       and     an
associated method of marking a buoy.
BACKGROUND ART
 [0002]          The    following            discussion             of    the    background         art     is
intended         to     facilitate             an       understanding               of      the    present
invention        only.      The      discussion             is     not     an   acknowledgement             or
admission that any of the material referred to is or was part
of the common general knowledge                            as at the priority                 date of the
application.
 [0003]          Fishing        is     an    ancient          practice         occurring worldwide
on    various       commercial,            traditional               and    recreational           scales.
Various        techniques            exist        for       catching          different         types       of
aquatic       animals.        One technique                uses      traps,      where       some manner
of    fishing      trap      is     placed       in      an    aquatic        environment          to   trap
aquatic animals,            such as fish,               crustaceans,            etc.     In   many cases,
a   long rope        is   attached to              a    trap,        at   the    end of which           is     a
float       or buoy to         indicate          a    position          of    the    trap,      generally
when submerged, and to allow retrieval thereof.
 [0004]          One example            of    a    fishing          technique        utilising        traps
is the practice of cray or rock lobster fishing. For example,
in    Western     Australia,             there        are      roughly        47,000       cray    or rock
lobster       or  fishing          licence         holders          as   of 2016.         Each    licensee
can      operate      2   cray       fishing          traps        or    pots.      During       the    cray
fishing       season,       such cray           pots       are used along               with partially

                                            2
submerged lengths       of   rope attached to floating buoys. Due to
the  large   number    of cray        fisherman,         such pots          and   ropes    can
cover   large    areas   of    coastal        waters.       Cray      fishing      pots    are
generally     fished   using      motorised         vessels,         which      means    that
during   peak     fishing     season,        it    is     extremely           difficult       to
navigate    such    areas,     particularly           if      a   fisherman        wants      to
retrieve their own cray pots.
[0005]      A     further       complication              is      that        the    Western
Australian     Department of Fisheries                allows       licence holders            to
begin pulling their pots             at 4.30am and must cease by 7.30pm.
At the start of the season, the sun does not rise until 5.30am
and sets at 6.30pm. This results in vessels navigating through
extremely    dangerous     waters        in   the    dark where           numerous      ropes
and buoys occur.
[0006]       In   such    circumstances,            potential           hazards      include
floating    and/or    submerged         ropes     wrapping          around      or   fouling
propellers. Once a propeller is                entangled in these ropes, the
vessel   cannot     move,    which        can   potentially             lead    to   vessels
colliding with      reefs,     endangering crew.                Similarly,        ropes    and
buoys that are run over by propellers can damage an engine and
a  run-over     buoy   or   float        can   get     propelled           into    the   air,
potentially colliding with persons or other vessels.
[0007]       Other    hazards        include        buoys        or     floats      becoming
severed from their      ropes,       leading to rope floating                   around that
may  harm marine      animals,       loss     of   fishing         equipment,        as  well
as marine life getting caught                in lost cray pots and cut ropes
and floats     littering beaches            and lost pots            littering the         sea
bed, potentially trapping animals.

                                                    3
 [0008]        In Western Australia, cray fishing                              season also           co
insides    with        the      re-opening        of   the     West     Coast        demersal        fin
fish   season.      These fish          are mainly targeted              in   the hours before
dawn    or   after        dusk,       leading       to   further        boat       traffic       often
through     areas         blanketed         with      cray     pots       during         periods       of
reduced visibility.
 [0009]        The       present         invention         was     conceived             with    these
shortcomings in mind.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 [0010]        in       this       specification,             reference            to       a   'line'
includes reference to any suitable rope, cord, string, cable,
wire,    or the       like,       which    is    generally useable               for       attachment
to   a   buoy      or     float      in    an    aquatic        environment.               Similarly,
reference to a            'buoy' in this specification is to be taken to
include    reference            to   any    suitable        buoy     or    float        useable      for
marking     a    location          or   position        of    a   fishing         trap,       net,     or
similar aquatic device.
 [0011]        According           to   a  first      aspect     of the         invention        there
is provided a buoy marker comprising:
       a   housing           sealed       against       the      ingress          of       fluid     and
configured for operative fitment to a line;
       an   indicator            housed within          said     housing         and       configured
to indicate the housing, when active;
       energising             means       housed        within          said         housing         and
configured to energise the                     indicator, in use;               and
       an ambient light sensor for sensing ambient light around
the housing, and configured to activate the indicator once the
ambient light falls below a particular threshold.

                                               4
 [0012]           In    an example,    the housing is         configured for fitment
to    a   line      by   said   housing    defining       a   funnel-shape          with      the
indicator located on a wider upper portion thereof,                              a narrower
lower       portion        shaped   and   dimensioned         for    operative         fitment
into     a     channel      defined   by   a  buoy,     the     funnel      shape      further
defining an inner channel through which a line is receivable,
so that a knot             in said line is       receivable by a flared portion
at an upper portion of said inner channel.
 [0013]           in    another    example,     the   housing        is    configured         for
fitment        to    a line by defining attachment                apertures via which
a line is securable to the housing.
 [0014]           In    another    example,     the   housing        is    configured         for
fitment         to    a  line   by   defining     a  toroidal          shape,     said      line
operatively passed through a central channel of said toroidal
housing.
 [0015]           Typically,       the   housing     comprises           a  substantially
transparent            upper   portion     covering      the     indicator        and     light
sensor.
 [0016]           Typically,        the     housing        is     moulded         over        the
indicator, energising means and light sensor to                              form a sealed
unit of unitary construction.
 [0017]           Typically,        the      indicator         comprises          a      visual
indicator in the form of a visible light emitter.
 [0018]           Typically, the indicator comprises a light emitting
diode       (LED) arrangement.

                                              5
 [0019]       In one example, the light emitting diode arrangement
is   programmable         so   that     a  frequency      and/or   period    of     light
emission are selectable.
 [0020]       Typically,            the    indicator       comprises    an      audible
indicator     in the form of a sound emitter emitting sound in a
frequency range of            1Hz to 20,000Hz.
 [0021]       Typically,         the    energising      means   comprises     at     least
one    electrochemical            cell    configured       to   provide   electrical
energy to the indicator.
 [0022]       Typically,           in   one    example      the   energising        means
comprises a replaceable battery.
 [0023]       In a further example, the energising means comprises
a  photo    voltaic        arrangement        for   solar     charging   a    suitable
electrical storage means.
 [0024]       In    a further        example,    the energising means comprises
a   wave   energy        converter        configured       to   charge  a     suitable
electrical storage means.
 [0025]       Typically,            the   housing      comprises     a  luminescent
material and/or coating.
 [0026]       In     one   example,       the   buoy   marker    includes    a    global
navigation satellite system                 (GNSS) locator with a transmitter
for transmitting a positional signal to a suitable receiver.

                                                6
 [0027]          In   one     example,      the   buoy     marker   includes      a   camera
and    transmitter              for     transmitting        images      to   a    suitable
receiver.
 [0028]          In   one     example,      the   buoy     marker   includes      a   switch
adapted to connect              or disconnect        the energising means          from the
indicator and/or light sensor.
 [0029]          Typically,         the    switch     comprises     a   magnetic      switch
configured           to       function        through        the      housing       without
compromising          a   fluid      sealing    ability      of  the    housing,     e.g.    a
magnetic switch, etc.
 [0030]          According to a second aspect of the                     invention there
is  provided        a    method      of marking       a   buoy  comprising      the    steps
of:
       attaching          a    buoy     marker    in     accordance     with    the    first
aspect of the invention to a line and buoy;                           and
       installing           the     line    and    buoy     with   buoy     marker     to    a
suitable fishing trap in an aquatic environment.
 [0031]          In one example,          the step of attaching the buoy marker
to   the      line      and     buoy     includes       passing    said    line     through
attachment         apertures        defined     by    a   housing   of   the   marker      and
tying a knot          in the line.
 [0032]          Typically, the step of attaching the buoy marker to
the line      and buoy includes passing said line                  through attachment
apertures defined by a housing of the marker and securing the
line by means of a cable tie or tie-wrap.

                                                7
 [0033]          In   one example,        the step of attaching the buoy marker
to    the   line       and      buoy    includes     passing        the    line      through       a
channel defined by the buoy and subsequently through an inner
channel      of     the     funnel      shaped    housing       of    the    marker       from     a
narrower end to             a wider end thereof, and tying a knot                          in the
line,     so that       the       narrower    end   of the      housing       fits      into the
buoy    channel        and the        knot  is   receivable         by   a flared        portion
at the wider portion of said inner channel of the buoy.
 [0034]         In another            example, the step          of attaching the buoy
marker to the           line and buoy includes passing the line through
a central channel defined by a toroidal buoy housing.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
 [0035]            Further      features      of the     present        invention      are more
fully described in the following description of                                 several non
limiting          embodiments          thereof.     This     description         is    included
solely for the purposes of exemplifying the present                                   invention
to     the    skilled        addressee.       It  should      not      be  understood         as  a
restriction           on    the    broad     summary,     disclosure         or   description
of the invention as set out above.                     In   the figures,        incorporated
to       illustrate           features        of    the       example        embodiment          or

                                              9
embodiments,      like      reference numerals are used to identify                           like
parts throughout.
[0036]        With      reference      now     to      the      accompanying         drawings,
Figure 1 shows         a typical    fishing        trap      4 with accompanying              line
7 and buoy 8 installed in an aquatic environment, typically a
body   of    water      9,    as  shown.       Arrow         3   indicates         an    example
direction of current,            wind and/or            swell, driving the buoys                    8
away from the submerged trap 4.                   In such a manner, a high-risk
zone 5 is     created which, should a boat or similar vessel pass
into, can lead to an entangled propeller or damage to the line
7 and/or buoys 8,          as described in          the background section above.
Similarly, the direction of wind, current and/or swell 3 forms
a low-risk zone 6, where the line 7 and/or buoys 8 do not form
an obstacle for safe boat or vessel passage.
[0037]        As will      be appreciated by the skilled                     addressee,         the
direction 3 can easily change depending on weather conditions
and  similar      circumstances,            thus       highlighting           the     need      for
clear and accurate indication of the buoys 8.
[0038]        Accordingly,        referring           now to        Figures      2  to    8,    the
present     invention        broadly     discloses           a   buoy     marker       10    which
comprises a housing 12 sealed against the ingress of fluid and
configured      for     operative      fitment          to    a   line    7.    It    is   to     be
appreciated      that        various     ways        of    sealing        the      housing        is
possible,     as    is    well   understood            in    the     art.    The    marker        10
further includes an indicator 14 housed within the housing 12
and which is       configured to          indicate the housing 12,                     when the
indicator 14      is active.

                                                        10
 [0039]            The       marker           10      also        includes         some       manner          of
energising means                  16 which is housed within the housing 12 and
is     configured            to       energise        the     indicator          14,     when     in      use.
Further       included             is     an   ambient        light        sensor     18     for   sensing
ambient        light         around         the    housing          12,     and   which       is   further
adapted       to      activate           the    indicator          14     once   the     ambient        light
falls below a particular threshold.
 [0040]            In    one example,             shown in        Figures 6 to 8,            the housing
12     is   configured             for      fitment       to    a    line     7  by   the     housing         12
defining         a     funnel-shape             with      the     indicator         14    located         on    a
wider       upper       portion          22   thereof.         A    narrower       lower      portion         24
is shaped and dimensioned for operative fitment into a channel
26 defined by a buoy 8.                        The     funnel        shaped housing 12             further
defines         an      inner          channel        28     through          which      a    line       7    is
receivable, so that a knot                           32   in the line           7 is     receivable by
a    flared       portion            30    at    the     upper        portion      22     of    the     inner
channel 28, as shown.
 [0041]            In     another          example        shown        in    Figures       2   to    5,     the
housing 12            is    configured for fitment                       to a line       7 by defining
attachment           points,           lugs    or    similar        suitable        apertures        20     via
which       a  line        7   is      securable         to   the       housing      12.     The   skilled
addressee will appreciate that the housing 12 can be attached
to a line 7 in various ways, one example of which may include
a cable tie or tie-wrap 21,                           as shown.
 [0042]            In    general,          the housing 12 comprises a substantially
transparent             upper        portion       which       covers        the   indicator         14     and
light       sensor 16.          For example,            the housing 12 may comprise some
manner of clear resin which is moulded over the indicator 14,
energising means                  16 and light sensor 18 to form a sealed unit

                                                     11
of     unitary        construction.            The       housing           12    may    also      further
comprise        a     luminescent         material            and/or         coating     to     increase
visibility          in darker conditions.
 [0043]          Typically,           the      indicator               14    comprises        a     visual
indicator         in    the  form of         a    visible           light      emitter,      such      as    a
light       emitting      diode       (LED)       arrangement.               In   one   example,         the
light      emitting diode            arrangement              can be programmable                so that
a    frequency         and/or    period        of      light        emission        are   selectable.
In    addition,         the   indicator           14     may     also       comprises       an    audible
indicator         in the     form of a sound emitter emitting sound in a
frequency range of 1Hz to 20,000Hz,                             i.e.      the human audio range.
 [0044]          The     skilled addressee                  will       appreciate that various
configurations are possible for suitable energising means 16.
For     example,        the   energising           means         16 may        comprises       at     least
one      electrochemical             cell      configured                to    provide      electrical
energy to the indicator                   15.      The energising means                   16 may also
comprise        a    replaceable         battery,            or     a   suitable       photo     voltaic
arrangement           for solar charging                  a suitable            electrical storage
means,       such as the cell,             a battery, or a capacitor, etc.                              In a
yet     further        example,      the     energising               means      16  may    comprise         a
wave      energy       converter        configured             to      charge       such   a    suitable
electrical storage means, so that energy can be harvested from
the aquatic environment directly, or the like.
 [0045]           In one example, the buoy marker 10 includes a switch
 (not     shown)       adapted     to    connect           or     disconnect         the    energising
means        16    from     the     indicator              14     and/or         light     sensor         18.
Typically, the switch comprises                             a magnetic switch configured
to function through the housing 12 without compromising a fluid
sealing ability of the housing 12.

                                                12
[0046]         For example,            a magnetic          switch can be used to turn
the marker 10 on. Once manufacturing is                              completed, the marker
10 may be in       standby mode until             it     is   time to deploy the marker
10.   A  user can then place a suitable magnet                               to a side of the
housing 12 to turn it               on.   The marker          10 may also be turned off
by placing a suitable magnet beside the housing, or the like.
[0047]         It    is     also    to   be   appreciated            that      the    buoy      marker
10  can include additional components for providing additional
functionality. For example, the buoy marker                                   10 may include a
global     navigation             satellite       system (GNSS)                locator         with     a
transmitter for transmitting a positional signal to a suitable
receiver.       Similarly,          in   one   example,          the      buoy    marker        10   may
include    a camera and transmitter for transmitting images to a
suitable receiver. Typically, the camera may include a motion
or tamper sensing means.
[0048]         For      example,        the    marker        10    may      be    configured          to
communicate        with        a  mobile    phone       via     a   suitable         application,
so that     a   user      is     able   to   track      a    geolocation          of the marker
10,   and/or      is    able to access          a    suitable camera               on the marker
10  if   the tamper             sensing    means      alerts       the      user    that       someone
is  moving or tampering with the marker 10                                or attached line 7
or   trap     4.     Such        features     provide          additional           security         and
verifiability to trap fishing practices.
[0049]         With       reference        to    Figures          9     and      10,      a    further
embodiment        of the         buoy marker      10      is    shown.       In this          example,
the    housing       12      is    configured        for      fitment         to   a     line      7  by
defining       a     toroidal          shape,     as        shown.         This     toroidal          or
'doughnut'        shaped housing            12  can be         attached         to    a   buoy      8 by
operatively passing line                 7 through a central                 channel as shown,

                                                      13
with     a    knot    32    tied       to prevent         the marker         10   from detaching
from the buoy 8, a shown.
 [0050]           It     is     also       to     be    appreciated         that     the    present
invention provides                 for an associated method of marking a buoy.
Such     a    method      generally            comprises       the    steps      of   attaching      a
buoy marker           10,     as    described         above,     to    a  line     7  and buoy    8,
and installing            the      line     7 and buoy 8 with buoy marker                   10 to a
suitable        fishing        trap      4   in    an   aquatic     environment,         generally
as shown in Figure 1.
 [0051]           As    described           above,       in   one    example,        the   step   of
attaching         the     buoy       marker        10   to  the    line      7   and   buoy   8  may
include        passing        the     line      through      attachment         points,    lugs   or
apertures         20    defined by           the     housing     12    of   the marker       10  and
tying a knot            in the line             7.   Similarly, the          step of attaching
the buoy marker 10 to the line                         7 and buoy 8 may include passing
said     line      through        such      attachment        points,        lugs    or  apertures
20 defined by the housing 12 of the marker 10 and securing the
line 7 by means of a cable tie or tie-wrap 21.
 [0052]           In    one     embodiment,           the   step     of   attaching       the   buoy
marker 10         to the        line 7 and buoy 8 includes passing the                          line
7 through a channel 26 defined by the buoy 8 and subsequently
through        an   inner        channel        28   of   the   funnel       shaped     housing   of
the marker 10 from a narrower end 24 to a wider end 22 thereof,
and tying a knot 32                   in the       line,    so that the narrower end 24
of the housing 12                 fits     into the buoy channel 26 and the knot
32    is   receivable by a                flared portion 30             at the wider portion
22    of said inner channel 26 of the buoy 8.

                                                     14
 [0053]             As     described      above,        the      housing         12     may     also       be
toroidal          shaped,       such    that      the     line      7   is    passed        through           a
central         channel       or passage         of    said housing             12 to      keep     it     in
place on the buoy, typically with a suitably-sized knot in the
line.
 [0054]             In the above-described manner,                        during times of                low
light        visibility,            the   light        sensor        18    activates            the      LED
indicator           14 turning on the unique timing blink. This blinking
light immediately allows the potentially hazardous                                          lengths of
submerged           ropes,     which are held            in     place     by the        float/buoy            8
