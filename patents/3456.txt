FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[002]    The present invention relates to the use of selective androgen receptor modulators
(SARM), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for the treatment and/or prevention of
certain diseases or disorders that are related to modulation of the androgen receptor. The
present invention also relates to a combination of novel heterocyclic compounds, or
pharmaceutically active salts thereof, which are effective as selective androgen receptor
modulators (SARM) with one or more further pharmaceutically active compounds, or
pharmaceutically active salts thereof. Furthermore, the present invention relates to
compositions comprising the combination of active agents and to the use of these combinations
of active ingredients to treat diseases or disorders that are related to modulation of the
androgen receptor. The present invention also relates to a crystalline form of 6-[(4R)-4-methyl
1,1-dioxido-1,2,6-thiadiazinan-2-yl]isoquinoline-1-carbonitrile, compositions thereof and to
processes for the preparation thereof. The invention also relates to a crystalline form of 6-[(4R)
4-methyl-1, 1-dioxido-1,2,6-thiadiazinan-2-yl]isoquinoline-1 -carbonitrile for the treatment of
diseases and disorders that are related to the modulation of the androgen receptor.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[003]    The androgen receptor ("AR") is a ligand-activated transcriptional regulatory protein that
mediates induction of male sexual development and function through its activity with
endogenous androgens. Androgenic steroids play an important role in many physiologic
processes, including the development and maintenance of male sexual characteristics such as
muscle and bone mass, prostate growth, spermatogenesis, and the male hair pattern. The
endogenous steroidal androgens include testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ("DHT").
Steroidal ligands which bind the AR and act as androgens (e.g. testosterone enanthate) or as
antiandrogens (e.g. cyproterone acetate) have been known for many years and are used
clinically.

2014, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and which is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety. These compounds are known to be active androgen receptor
modulators (SARM) and, as such, useful for treating and/or preventing a variety of hormone
related conditions, for example, conditions associated with androgen decline, such as, inter alia,
anaemia; anorexia; arthritis; bone disease; musculoskeletal impairment; cachexia; frailty; age
related functional decline in the elderly; growth hormone deficiency; hematopoietic disorders;
hormone replacement; loss of muscle strength and/or function; muscular dystrophies; muscle
loss following surgery; muscular atrophy; neurodegenerative disease; neuromuscular disease;
obesity; osteoporosis; and muscle wasting.
[005]    There is an on-going need to provide new therapies for treating and/or preventing a
variety of hormone related conditions.
[006]    There is an on-going need to provide improved therapies useful for treating and/or
preventing a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example, conditions associated with
androgen decline, such as, inter alia, anemia; anorexia; arthritis; bone disease; musculoskeletal
impairment; cachexia; frailty; age-related functional decline in the elderly; growth hormone
deficiency; hematopoietic disorders; hormone replacement; loss of muscle strength and/or
function; muscular dystrophies; muscle loss following surgery; muscular atrophy;
neurodegenerative diseases; neuromuscular disease; obesity; osteoporosis; and, muscle
wasting. Combination therapies as provided herein, compositions thereof, and associated

                                                     4
methods of treatment may provide a therapeutic regimen that provides a greater efficacy and /
or an improved tolerability to the use of either agent alone.
[007]   Identification of new solid forms of a known pharmaceutical active ingredient provide a
means of optimising either the physicochemical, stability, manufacturability and/or
bioperformance characteristics of the active pharmaceutical ingredient without modifying its
chemical structure. Based on a chemical structure, one cannot predict with any degree of
certainty whether a compound will crystallise, under what conditions it will crystallise, or the
solid state structure of any of those crystalline forms. The specific solid form chosen for drug
development can have dramatic influence on the properties of the drug product. The selection
of a suitable solid form is partially dictated by yield, rate and quantity of the crystalline structure.
In addition, hygroscopicity, stability, solubility and the process profile of the solid form such as
compressibility, powder flow and density are important considerations.
[008]   As such, there is a need to identify solid forms of compounds known to be active
androgen receptor modulators, including 6-[(4R)-4-methyl-1,1-dioxido-1,2,6-thiadiazinan-2
yl]isoquinoline-1-carbonitrile, that exhibit acceptable physicochemical, stability,
manufacturability and/or bioperformance properties.
[009]   Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word
"comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the
inclusion of a stated element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not
the exclusion of any other element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps.
[010]   Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles or the like which has
been included in the present specification is solely for the purpose of providing a context for the
present invention. It is not to be taken as an admission that any or all of these matters form part
of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present
invention as it existed before the priority date of each claim of this specification.

group of the formula CnH 2 ,+1 which may be linear or branched. Examples of such groups include
methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, iso-amyl and
hexyl. Unless otherwise specified, an alkyl group comprises from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The
carbon atom content of alkyl and various other hydrocarbon-containing moieties is indicated by
a prefix designating a lower and upper number of carbon atoms in the moiety, that is, the prefix
CrCj indicates a moiety of the integer "i" to the integer "j"carbon atoms, inclusive. Thus, for

attached via a ring nitrogen atom (when the heterocycle is attached to a carbon atom) or a ring
carbon atom (in all cases). Equally, when substituted, the substituent may be located on a ring
nitrogen atom (if the substituent is joined through a carbon atom) or a ring carbon atom (in all
cases). Specific examples include oxiranyl, aziridinyl, oxetanyl, azetidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl,
pyrrolidinyl, tetrahydropyranyl, piperidinyl, 1,4-dioxanyl, morpholinyl, piperazinyl, azepanyl,
oxepanyl, oxazepanyl and diazepinyl.
[038]    The term "heteroaryl" refers to an aromatic heterocycle which may be attached via a ring
carbon atom (in all cases) or a ring nitrogen atom with an appropriate valency (when the
heterocycle is attached to a carbon atom). Equally, when substituted, the substituent may be
located on a ring carbon atom (in all cases) or a ring nitrogen atom with an appropriate valency
(if the substituent is joined through a carbon atom). Specific examples include thienyl, furanyl,
pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazoyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, triazolyl, oxadiazolyl,
thiadiazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl and pyrazinyl. The term "cycloalkyl"
means a means a monocyclic, saturated hydrocarbon group of the formula CnH 2 , 1 . Examples
include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and cycloheptyl. Unless otherwise
specified, a cycloalkyl group comprises from 3 to 8 carbon atoms.
[039]    The term "oxo" means a double-bonded oxygen. The term "alkoxy" means a radical
comprising an alkyl radical that is bonded to an oxygen atom, such as a methoxy radical.

[040]     Compounds of Formula 1, Formula 2 or Formula 3 can be prepared in accordance with
the procedures outlined herein, from commercially available starting materials, compounds
known in the literature, or readily prepared intermediates, by employing standard synthetic
methods and procedures known to those skilled in the art. Standard synthetic methods and
procedures for the preparation of organic molecules and functional group transformations and
manipulations can be readily obtained from the relevant scientific literature or from standard
textbooks in the field. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions
(i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given;
other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction
conditions can vary with the particular reactants or solvent used. Those skilled in the art will
recognize that the nature and order of the synthetic steps presented can be varied for the
purpose of optimizing the formation of the compounds described herein.
[041]    Accordingly, the general reaction schemes provided herein illustrate the preparation of
the compounds of Formula 1, formula 2 or Formula 3. Unless otherwise indicated, the

[042]     Bromides of general formula I are coupled with aminoalcohols II under coupling
conditions such as Pd-catalyzed coupling conditions. The hydroxyl groups of compounds III are
activated as leaving groups by mesylate formation among other methods in the presence of a
base to generate compounds IV. The treatment of compounds IV with the reagent V produces
Boc-protected intermediates VI. Boc-group de-protection followed by alkylation or acylation of
intermediate NH compounds culminates the synthesis of a chemical class of compounds of
general formula VII. The preparation of products Vil with R3 and R4 being unprotected amino,
hydroxyl or carboxylic acid groups would require protection of the corresponding functionality
using standard methods of organic chemistry and de-protection in the appropriate point in the
synthetic sequence.
[043]     The preparation of compounds with A being carbon is exemplified by the synthesis of 6
[(3S)-3-methyl-1, 1-dioxido-1,2-thiazolidin-2-yl]isoquinoline-1 -carbonitrile (Example 8).
[044]     When Z (Formula 3) is not equal to N, an alternative procedure to the one described
above should be applied. The preparation of compounds with A being carbon is exemplified by
the synthesis of 6-[(3S)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dioxido-1,2,5-thiadiazolidin-2-yl]isoquinoline-1
carbonitrile (Example 7).

[045]   Aminoacids Vill are converted into methyl esters IX via a standard acid chloride
formation protocols. The esters IX undergo transformations into a corresponding ketones (or
aldehydes) X using a nucleophilic reagents M-R9 that deliver fragments R9 . An alternative
approach to produce ketones X would be to employ functional equivalents such as Weinreb
amides that are described in the organic chemistry literature. The keto or aldehyde groups are
reduced to produce aminoalcohols XI which are coupled with bromide I under Pd-catalyzed
conditions. The hydroxyl groups of compounds XII are oxidized to yield a keto or aldehyde
compounds XIll which are treated with either CF 3-group delivering reagents or with a
nucleophilic reagents M-R 10 that contains fragments R10 . The product XIV contains R10
functionality where R10 may be represented by CF 3 or another group described in claims. The
preparation of products XIV with R3, R4, R5, R6 , R8 , R9 , and R1a that contain unprotected NH, OH

functionality using standard methods of organic chemistry and de-protection in the appropriate
point in the synthetic sequence.
[047]   The processes described herein can be monitored according to any suitable method
known in the art. For example, product formation can be monitored by spectroscopic means,
such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (e.g., 1H or 13C), infrared spectroscopy,
spectrophotometry (e.g., UV-visible), mass spectrometry, or by chromatography such as high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), gel-permeation
chromatography (GPC), or thin layer chromatography (TLC).
[048]   Preparation of the compounds of Formula 1, Formula 2 or Formula 3 can involve
protection and de-protection of various chemical groups. The chemistry of protecting groups
can be found, for example, in Greene et al., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th. Ed.
(John Wiley & Sons, 2007), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein for
all purposes.
[049]   References to compounds of Formula 1, 2 or 3 are taken to include the compounds
themselves and prodrugs thereof. As such, references to compounds of Formula 1, Formula 2
or Formula 3 includes refrerences to compounds of Formula 1, 2 or 3 as well as
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such compounds, and prodrugs of such compounds and
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such prodruges, and to pharmaceutically acceptable
solvates of said compounds, slats thereof, prodrugs thereof and salts of prodrugs thereof.
[050]   Included within the scope of a compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 as described herein is that
compound in the form of a prodrug. Thus, certain derivatives of a compound of Formula 1, 2 or
3 which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into
or onto the body, be converted into a compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 having the desired activity,
for example by hydrolytic cleavage, particularly hydrolytic cleavage promoted by an esterase or
peptidase enzyme. Such derivatives are referred to as 'prodrugs'. Further information on the
use of prodrugs may be found in 'Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems', Vol. 14, ACS

produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of Formula 1, 2 or 3
with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as 'pro-moieties' as described, for
example, in 'Design of Prodrugs' by H. Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).
[052]   Thus, a prodrug of the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 as described herein is (a) an ester
or amide derivative of a carboxylic acid in a compound of Formula 1, 2 or 13; (b) an ester,
carbonate, carbamate, phosphate or ether derivative of a hydroxyl group in a compound of
Formula 1, 2 or 3; (c) an amide, imine, carbamate or amine derivative of an amino group in a
compound form Formula 1, 2 or 3; (d) a thioester, thiocarbonate, thiocarbamate or sulphide
derivatives of a thiol group in a compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3; or (e) an oxime or imine
derivative of a carbonyl group in a compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3.
[053]   Some specific examples of prodrugs of the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 as described
herein include:
(i)     where the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 contains a carboxylic acid functionality (
COOH), an ester thereof, such as a compound wherein the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid
functionality of the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 is replaced by C1-C alkyl (e.g. ethyl) or (C1
Cs alkyl)C(=O)OCH 2- (e.g. t BuC(=O)OCH 2-);
(ii)    where the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 contains an alcohol functionality (-OH), an
ester thereof, such as a compound wherein the hydrogen of the alcohol functionality of the
compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 is replaced by -CO(C1-C8 alkyl) (e.g. methylcarbonyl) or the
alcohol is esterified with an amino acid;
(iii)   where the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 contains an alcohol functionality (-OH), an
ether thereof, such as a compound wherein the hydrogen of the alcohol functionality of the
compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 is replaced by (C1-C8 alkyl)C(=O)OCH 2- or -CH 2OP(=O)(OH) 2;
(iv)    where the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 contains an alcohol functionality (-OH), a
phosphate thereof, such as a compound wherein the hydrogen of the alcohol functionality of the
compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 is replaced by -P(=O)(OH)      2 or -P(=O)(ONa)  2 or -P(=O)(0
)2Ca 2;
(v)     where the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 contains a primary or secondary amino
functionality (-NH 2 or -NHR where R 0 H), an amide thereof, for example, a compound wherein,
as the case may be, one or both hydrogens of the amino functionality of the compound of
Formula 1, 2 or 3 is/are replaced by (C1 -C1 a)alkanoyl, -COCH 2NH2 or the amino group is
derivatized with an amino acid; or,
(vi)    where the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 contains a primary or secondary amino
functionality (-NH 2 or -NHR where R 0 H), an amine thereof, for example, a compound wherein,

                                                    21
as the case may be, one or both hydrogens of the amino functionality of the compound of
 Formula 1, 2 or 3 is/are replaced by -CH 2OP(=O)(OH) 2.
 [054]   Certain compounds of Formula 1, 2 or 3 may themselves act as prodrugs of other
compounds of Formula 1, 2 or 3. It is also possible for two compounds of Formula 1, 2 or 3 to be
joined together in the form of a prodrug. In certain circumstances, a prodrug of a compound of
 Formula 1, 2 or 3 may be created by internally linking two functional groups in a compound of
 Formula 1, 2 or 3, for instance by forming a lactone.
 [055]   Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of Formula 1, 2 or 3 include acid
addition and base salts. Suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non-toxic
salts. Examples include the acetate, adipate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate,
 bicarbonate/carbonate, bisulfate/sulfate, borate, camsylate, citrate, cyclamate, edisylate,
esylate, formate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, hexafluorophosphate,
 hibenzate, hydrochloride/chloride, hydrobromide/bromide, hydroiodide/iodide, isethionate,
 lactate, malate, maleate, malonate, mesylate, methylsulfate, naphthylate, 2-napsylate,
 nicotinate, nitrate, orotate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, phosphate/hydrogen
 phosphate/dihydrogen phosphate, pyroglutamate, saccharate, stearate, succinate, tannate,
tartrate, tosylate, trifluoroacetate, naphthalene-1,5-disulfonic acid and xinofoate salts.
 [056]   Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts. Examples include
the aluminium, arginine, benzathine, calcium, choline, diethylamine, diolamine, glycine, lysine,
 magnesium, meglumine, olamine, potassium, sodium, tromethamine and zinc salts. Hemisalts
of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulfate and hemicalcium salts. For a
 review on suitable salts, see Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use
 by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, 2002).
 [057]   Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of Formula 1, 2 or 3 may be prepared
 by one or more of three methods:
 (i)     by reacting the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 with the desired acid or base;
 (ii)    by removing an acid- or base-labile protecting group from a suitable precursor of the
compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 or by ring-opening a suitable cyclic precursor, for example, a
 lactone or lactam, using the desired acid or base; or,
 (iii)   by converting one salt of the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 to another by reaction with
an appropriate acid or base or by means of a suitable ion exchange column.
 [058]   All three reactions are typically carried out in solution. The resulting salt may precipitate
out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree
of ionization in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionized to almost non-ionized.
 [059]   The compounds of Formula 1, 2 or 3, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,
 may exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. The term 'solvate' is used herein to describe a
 molecular complex comprising the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3, or a pharmaceutically

                                                  22
acceptable salt thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for
example, ethanol. The term 'hydrate' may be employed when said solvent is water.
[060]   A currently accepted classification system for organic hydrates is one that defines
isolated site, channel, or metal-ion coordinated hydrates - see Polymorphism in Pharmaceutical
Solids by K. R. Morris (Ed. H. G. Brittain, Marcel Dekker, 1995). Isolated site hydrates are ones
in which the water molecules are isolated from direct contact with each other by intervening
organic molecules. In channel hydrates, the water molecules lie in lattice channels where they
are next to other water molecules. In metal-ion coordinated hydrates, the water molecules are
bonded to the metal ion.
[061]   When the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined
stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound,
as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water/solvent content will be
dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the
norm.
[062]   Also included within the definition of compounds of Formula 1, Formula 2 or Formula 3
as described herein are multi-component complexes (other than salts and solvates) wherein the
drug and at least one other component are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric
amounts. Complexes of this type include clathrates (drug-host inclusion complexes) and co
crystals. The latter are typically defined as crystalline complexes of neutral molecular
constituents which are bound together through non-covalent interactions, but could also be a
complex of a neutral molecule with a salt. Co-crystals may be prepared by melt crystallization,
by recrystallization from solvents, or by physically grinding the components together - see Chem
Commun, 17 1889-1896, by 0. Almarsson and M. J. Zaworotko (2004). For a general review of
multi-component complexes, see J Pharm Sci, 64 (8), 1269-1288, by Haleblian (August 1975).
[063]    Hereinafter, all references to compounds of Formula 1, 2 or 3 are to be considered to
include references to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, multi-component complexes
and liquid crystals thereof and to solvates, multi-component complexes and liquid crystals of
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
[064]   The compounds of Formula 1, 2 or 3 may exhibit polymorphism and/or one or more
kinds of isomerism (e.g. optical, geometric or tautomeric isomerism). The compounds of
Formula 1, 2 or 3 may also be isotopically labelled. Such variation is implicit to the compounds
of Formula 1, 2 or 3 defined as they are by reference to their structural features and therefore
within the scope of the invention.
[065]    Compounds of Formula 1, 2 or 3 containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can
exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 contains an
alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cis/trans (or Z/E) isomers are possible. Where structural
isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier, tautomeric isomerism ('tautomerism') can
occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds of Formula 1, 2 or 3

                                                 23
containing, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group, or so-called valence tautomerism in
compounds which contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit
more than one type of isomerism.
[066]    The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of Formula 1, 2 or 3 may also
contain a counterion which is optically active (e.g. d-lactate or -lysine) or racemic (e.g. dl
tartrate or dl-arginine). Cis/trans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well
known to those skilled in the art, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallization.
{067}    Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include
chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the
racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography
(HPLC). Alternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable
optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound of
Formula 1, Formula 2 or Formula 3 contains an acidic or basic moiety, a base or acid such as 1
phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by
chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers
converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person.
Chiral compounds of Formula 1, Formula 2 or Formula 3 (and chiral precursors thereof) may be
obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an
asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane,
containing from 0 to 50% by volume of isopropanol, typically from 2% to 20%, and from 0 to 5%
by volume of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the
enriched mixture. Chiral chromatography using sub-and supercritical fluids may be employed.
Methods for chiral chromatography useful in some embodiments of the present invention are
known in the art (see, for example, Smith, Roger M., Loughborough University, Loughborough,
UK; Chromatographic Science Series (1998), 75 (Supercritical Fluid Chromatography with
Packed Columns), pp. 223-249 and references cited therein). In some relevant examples
herein, columns were obtained from Chiral Technologies, Inc, West Chester, Pennsylvania,
USA, a subsidiary of Daicel* Chemical Industries, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.
[068]    When any racemate crystallizes, crystals of two different types are possible. The first
type is the racemic compound (true racemate) referred to above wherein one homogeneous
form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type
is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar
amounts each comprising a single enantiomer. While both of the crystal forms present in a
racemic mixture have identical physical properties, they may have different physical properties
compared to the true racemate. Racemic mixtures may be separated by conventional
techniques known to those skilled in the art. Stereochemistry of Orqanic Compounds by E. L.
Eliel and S. H. Wilen (Wiley, 1994).

                                                    24
[069]   As used herein, the term compounds of Formula 1, Formula 2 or Formula 3 also
includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula 1, Formula
2 or Formula 3 wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic
number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number
which predominates in nature. Isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula 1, Formula 2 or
Formula 3 can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the
art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and
Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labelled reagent in place of the non-labelled
reagent previously employed. In particular, hydrogen atoms may be replaced by deuterium
atoms since such deuterated compounds are sometimes more resistant to metabolism.
[070]   As defined herein compounds of Formula 1, Formula 2 or Formula 3 also include within
their scope active metabolites of compounds of Formula 1, Formula 2 or Formula 3, that is,
compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug, often by oxidation or dealkylation.
Some examples of metabolites in accordance with the invention include:
(i)     where the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 contains a methyl group, an hydroxymethyl
derivative thereof (-CH 3 -> -CH 2OH):
(ii)    where the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 contains an alkoxy group, an hydroxy
derivative thereof (-OR -> -OH);
(iii)   where the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 contains a tertiary amino group, a secondary
amino derivative thereof (-NRR      ->  -NHR or -NHR);
(iv)    where the compound of Formula 1 contains a secondary amino group, a primary
derivative thereof (-NHR-> -NH 2 );
(v)     where the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 contains a phenyl moiety, a phenol derivative
thereof (-Ph -> -PhOH); and,
(vi)    where the compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3 contains an amide group, a carboxylic acid
derivative thereof (-CONH 2 -> COOH).
[071]    In an even more particularly preferred embodiment, the compound of Formula 1,
Formula 2 or Formula 3 is a crystalline form of 6-[(4R)-4-methyl-1,1-dioxido-1,2,6-thiadiazinan
2-yl]isoquinoline-1 -carbonitrile, wherein 6-[(4R)-4-methyl-1,1-dioxido-1,2,6-thiadiazinan-2
yl]isoquinoline-1-carbonitrile is in it's free base form.
[072]   There are a number of analytical methods one of ordinary skill in the art can use to
analyze solid forms, in particular crystalline solid forms. The term "analyze" as used herein shall
be taken to mean to obtain information about the solid state structure of solid forms. For
example, X-ray powder diffraction is one such suitable technique for differentiating amorphous
solid forms from crystalline solid forms and for characterizing and identifying crystalline solid
forms since different crystalline forms exhibit different X-ray powder patterns. A discussion of
the theory of X-ray powder diffraction patterns can be found in Clearfield, Reibenspies and

                                                  25

Sons, Incorporated (2008), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[073]    Due to differences in instruments, samples and sample preparation, minor variation in
peak values in spectroscopic techniques can occur. In an X-ray powder diffraction pattern
typical precision of a 2-theta x-axis value of an x-ray powder pattern is of the order of plus or
minus 0.20 2-theta. As such, a peak value reported to be at 9.20 2-theta could occur at
anywhere between 9.0' 2-theta and 9.4 2-theta when measured on most x-ray diffractometers
under most conditions. In a FT-Raman spectra typical precision of a Raman shift is of the order
of plus or minus 2cm-1. In a solid state NMR the typicial precision of a 13C peak shift is of the
order of plus or minus 0.2ppm.

one embodiment, "anemia" refers to the condition of having less than the normal number of red
blood cells or less than the normal quantity of hemoglobin in the blood, reduced hematocrit or
reduced mean corpuscular volume, or reduced corpuscular size. The oxygen-carrying capacity
of the blood is decreased in anemia. In some embodiments, treating anemia may also refer
herein to treating underlying factors resulting in anemia, such as for example: a) hemorrhage
(bleeding); b) hemolysis (excessive destruction of red blood cells); c) underproduction of red
blood cells; and d) not enough normal hemoglobin. In some embodiments, treating anemia in
this invention refers to treating any form thereof, including aplastic anemia, benzene poisoning,
Fanconi anemia, hemolytic disease of the newborn, hereditary spherocytosis, iron deficiency
anemia, osteoporosis, pernicious anemia, sickle cell disease, aplastic anemia, hemolytic

trabecular connectivity.
[0116] In one embodiment, the bone related disorder is a genetic disorder, or in another
embodiment, is induced as a result of a treatment regimen for a given disease. For example,
and in one embodiment, the compounds of Formula 1, Formula 2 or Formula 3, or
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as herein described are useful in treating a bone
related disorder that arises as a result of cancer metastasis to bone, or in another embodiment,
as a result of androgen-deprivation therapy, for example, given in response to prostate
carcinogenesis in the subject. In one embodiment, the bone-related disorder is osteoporosis. In
another embodiment, the bone-related disorder is osteopenia. In another embodiment, the
bone-related disorder is increased bone resorption. In another embodiment, the bone-related
disorder is bone fracture. In another embodiment, the bone-related disorder is bone frailty. In
another embodiment, the bone-related disorder is a loss of bone mineral density (BMD). In
another embodiment, the bone-related disorder is any combination of osteoporosis, osteopenia,
increased bone resorption, bone fracture, bone frailty and loss of BMD. Each disorder
represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.
[0117] "Osteoporosis" refers, in one embodiment, to a thinning of the bones with reduction in
bone mass due to depletion of calcium and bone protein. In another embodiment, osteoporosis
is a systemic skeletal disease, characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone
tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. In osteoporotic
patients, bone strength is abnormal, in one embodiment, with a resulting increase in the risk of
fracture. In another embodiment, osteoporosis depletes both the calcium and the protein
collagen normally found in the bone, in one embodiment, resulting in either abnormal bone
quality or decreased bone density. In another embodiment, bones that are affected by
osteoporosis can fracture with only a minor fall or injury that normally would not cause a bone
fracture. The fracture can be, in one embodiment, either in the form of cracking (as in a hip
fracture) or collapsing (as in a compression fracture of the spine). The spine, hips, and wrists
are common areas of osteoporosis-induced bone fractures, although fractures can also occur in

                                                    32
other skeletal areas. Unchecked osteoporosis can lead, in another embodiment, to changes in
posture, physical abnormality, and decreased mobility.
[0118] Osteoporosis may result from androgen deprivation. Accordingly, in another
embodiment, the osteoporosis follows androgen deprivation. In another embodiment, the
osteoporosis is primary osteoporosis. In another embodiment, the osteoporosis is secondary
osteoporosis. In another embodiment, the osteoporosis is postmenopausal osteoporosis. In
another embodiment, the osteoporosis isjuvenile osteoporosis. In another embodiment, the
osteoporosis is idiopathic osteoporosis. In another embodiment, the osteoporosis is senile
osteoporosis.
[0119] "Sarcopenia" in one embodiment refers to the degenerative loss of skeletal muscle
mass, quality and strength associated with aging, In one embodiment sarcopenia is a
component of the fraility syndrome, It may be characterized by attributes such as muscle
atrophy alone or in conjunction with one or more additional attributes such as wa reduction in
muscle tissue quality characterized by such factors such as replacemement of muscle fibres
with fat, an increase in fibrosis, changes in muscle metabolism, oxidative stress and
degeneration of the neuromuscular junction, oe or more of which can lead to progressive loss of
muscle function and frailty. In one embodiment the sarcopenia is in chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.
[0120] In another aspect, the the disorder or condition relates to reducing the incidence,
delaying the onset or progression, or reducing and/or abrogating the symptoms associated with
a musculoskeletal disease in a subject.
[0121] In one embodiment, the skeletal-related events treated using the methods provided
herein provided herein, are fractures, which in one embodiment, are pathological fractures, non
traumatic fractures, vertebral fracture, non-vertebral fractures, morphometric fractures, or a
combination thereof. In some embodiments, fractures may be simple, compound, transverse,
greenstick, or comminuted fractures. In one embodiment, fractures may be to any bone in the
body, which in one embodiment, is a fracture in any one or more bones of the arm, wrist, hand,
finger, leg, ankle, foot, toe, hip, collar bone, or a combination thereof. In another embodiment,
the methods and/or compounds or compositions provided herein, are effective in treatment,
prevention, suppression, inhibition or reduction of the risk of skeletal-related events such as
pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, hypercalcemia, bone-related pain, or their
combination.
[0122] In another embodiment, the skeletal-related events sought to be treated using the
methods provided herein and/or utilizing the compositions provided herein, comprise the
necessity for bone surgery and/or bone radiation, which in some embodiments, is for the
treatment of pain resulting in one embodiment from bone damage, or nerve compression. In
another embodiment, the skeletal-related events sought to be treated using the methods

                                                  33
provided herein and/or utilizing the compositions provided herein, comprise spinal cord
compression, or the necessity for changes in antineoplastic therapy, including changes in
hormonal therapy, in a subject. In some embodiments, skeletal-related events sought to be
treated using the methods provided herein and/or utilizing the compositions provided herein,
comprise treating, suppressing, preventing, reducing the incidence of, or delaying progression
or severity of bone metastases, or bone loss. In one embodiment, bone loss may comprise
osteoporosis, osteopenia, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, skeletal-related events
may comprise any combination of the embodiments listed herein.
[0123] In one embodiment, the skeletal-related events are a result of cancer therapy. In one
embodiment, the skeletal-related events are a result of hormone deprivation therapy, while in

[0124] A muscle is a tissue of the body that primarily functions as a source of power. There are
three types of muscles in the body: a) skeletal muscle--the muscle responsible for moving
extremities and external areas of the bodies; b) cardiac muscle--the heart muscle; and c)
smooth muscle--the muscle that is in the walls of arteries and bowel. A wasting condition or
disorder is defined herein as a condition or disorder that is characterized, at least in part, by an
abnormal, progressive loss of body, organ or tissue mass. A wasting condition can occur as a
result of a pathology such as, for example, cancer, or an infection, or it can be due to a
physiologic or metabolic state, such as disuse deconditioning that can occur, for example, due
to prolonged bed rest or when a limb is immobilized, such as in a cast. A wasting condition can

                                                 34
also be age associated. The loss of body mass that occurs during a wasting condition can be
characterized by a loss of total body weight, or a loss of organ weight such as a loss of bone or
muscle mass due to a decrease in tissue protein.
[0125] In another aspect, the disorder or condition is muscle atrophy or a wasting condition or
disorder. In one embodiment, therefore, the invention provides for the treatment of wasting
diseases, including but not limited to, muscle injury, bed rest, immobility, nerve injury,
neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, alcoholic neuropathy, anorexia, anorexia nervosa, anorexia
associated with cachexia, anorexia associated with aging, subacute combined degeneration of
the spinal cord, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, motor neurone diseases, Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, carpal tunnel syndrome, chronic infection, tuberculosis, Addison's disease, adult
sma, limb muscle atrophy, back tumour, dermatomyositis, hip cancer, inclusion body myositis,
incontinentia pigmenti, intercostal neuralgia, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, Legg-Calve-Perthes
disease, muscle atrophy, multifocal motor neuropathy, nephrotic syndrome, osteogenesis
imperfecta, post-polio syndrome, rib tumor, spinal muscular atrophy, reflex sympathetic
dystrophy syndrome, or Tay-Sachs.
[0126] In one embodiment, the terms "muscle wasting" or "muscular wasting", refer to the
progressive loss of muscle mass and/or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of
muscles, including the skeletal or voluntary muscles which control movement, cardiac muscles
which control the heart, and smooth muscles. In one embodiment, the muscle wasting condition
or disorder is a chronic muscle wasting condition or disorder. "Chronic muscle wasting" is
defined herein as the chronic (i.e. persisting over a long period of time) progressive loss of
muscle mass and/or to the chronic progressive weakening and degeneration of muscle. Muscle
wasting can occur as a result of a pathology, disease, condition or disorder. In one embodiment,
the pathology, illness, disease or condition is chronic. In another embodiment, the pathology,
illness, disease or condition is genetic.
[0127] The loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a
muscle protein breakdown or degradation, by muscle protein catabolism. Protein catabolism
occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation, an unusually low rate of
protein synthesis, or a combination of both. Protein catabolism or depletion, whether caused by
a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis, leads to a decrease
in muscle mass and to muscle wasting. The term "catabolism" has its commonly known
meaning in the art, specifically an energy burning form of metabolism.
[0128] In a particular aspect, the disorder or condition associated with the present inveniton is
muscle atrophy or wasting associated with disuse, trauma, immobilization, spinal cord injury, or
stroke comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a compound
of the present invention. Even more particularly, the disorder or condition associated with the
present inveniton is muscle atrophy associated with hip or knee replacement, hip fracture,
spinal cord injury, or stroke.

                                                   35
[0129] In another embodiment, the pathology, illness, disease or condition of muscle wasting or
muscular wasting is neurological. In another embodiment, the pathology, illness, disease or
condition is infectious. As described herein, the pathologies, diseases, conditions or disorders
for which the compounds and compositions of the present invention are administered are those
that directly or indirectly produce a wasting (i.e. loss) of muscle mass, that is a muscle wasting
disorder.
[0130] In one embodiment, muscle wasting in a subject is a result of the subject having a
muscular dystrophie; muscle atrophy; X-linked spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). In
some embodiments, muscle loss or muscle wasting or cachexia in a subject results in reduced
protein reserves, decreased strength and functional capacity, frailty, falls, reduced aerobic
capacity, reduced energy requirements or increased mortality in patients and the methods of
this invention serve to treat these conditions, as well. In some embodiments, muscle loss or
muscle wasting or cachexia in a subject results in increased dietary protein needs, inflammation
(accelerated muscle protein breakdown), loss of motor units (aging CNS), reduced rate of
muscle protein synthesis (post-prandial), and/or changing endocrine function (testosterone,
estrogen, growth hormone, insulin resistance) and the methods of this invention serve to treat
these conditions, as well.
[0131] If the condition or disorder is a muscular dystrophy, it includes, but is not limited to,
genetic diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal or
voluntary muscles that control movement. The muscles of the heart and some other involuntary
muscles are also affected in some forms of muscular dystrophy. The major forms of muscular
dystrophy (MD) are: duchenne muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, duchenne muscular
dystrophy, becker muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, facioscapulhumeral
muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, distal
muscular dystrophy and emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Muscular dystrophy can affect
people of all ages. Although some forms first become apparent in infancy or childhood, others
may not appear until middle age or later. Duchenne MD is the most common form, typically
affecting children. Myotonic dystrophy is the most common of these diseases in adults. Muscle
atrophy (MA) is characterized by wasting away or diminution of muscle and a decrease in
muscle mass. For example, Post-Polio MA is a muscle wasting that occurs as part of the post
polio syndrome (PPS). The atrophy includes weakness, muscle fatigue, and pain.
[0132] In another aspect the disorder or condition is a muscular atrophy. Muscular atrophy
includes, but is not limited to, those muscular atrophies which are X-linked spinal-bulbar
muscular atrophy (SBMA--also known as Kennedy's Disease). This disease arises from a defect
in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome, affects only males, and its onset is in
adulthood. Because the primary disease cause is an androgen receptor mutation, androgen
replacement is not a current therapeutic strategy. There are some investigational studies where
exogenous testosterone propionate is being given to boost the levels of androgen with hopes of

                                                  36
overcoming androgen insensitivity and perhaps provide an anabolic effect. Still, use of
supraphysiological levels of testosterone for supplementation will have limitations and other
potentially serious complications.
[0133] Sarcopenia a debilitating disease that afflicts the elderly and chronically ill patients and is
characterized by loss of muscle mass and function. Further, increased lean body mass is
associated with decreased morbidity and mortality for certain muscle-wasting disorders. In
addition, other circumstances and conditions are linked to, and can cause muscle wasting
disorders. For example, studies have shown that in severe cases of chronic lower back pain,
there is paraspinal muscle wasting.
[0134] Muscle wasting and other tissue wasting is also associated with advanced age. It is
believed that general weakness in old age is due to muscle wasting. As the body ages, an
increasing proportion of skeletal muscle is replaced by fibrous tissue. The result is a significant
reduction in muscle power, performance and endurance.
[0135] Long term hospitalization due to illness or injury, or disuse deconditioning that occurs,
for example, when a limb is immobilized, can also lead to muscle wasting, or wasting of other
tissue. Studies have shown that in patients suffering injuries, chronic illnesses, burns, trauma
or cancer, who are hospitalized for long periods of time, there is a long-lasting unilateral muscle
wasting, and a decrease in body mass.
[0136] Injuries or damage to the central nervous system (CNS) are also associated with muscle
wasting and other wasting disorders. Injuries or damage to the CNS can be, for example,
caused by diseases, trauma or chemicals. Examples are central nerve injury or damage,
peripheral nerve injury or damage and spinal cord injury or damage. In one embodiment CNS
damage or injury comprise Alzheimer's diseases (AD); anger (mood); anorexia, anorexia
nervosa, anorexia associated with aging and/or assertiveness (mood).
[0137] In another embodiment, the disorder or condition is muscle wasting or other tissue
wasting which occurs as a result of alcoholism. In one embodiment, the wasting disease,
disorder or condition being treated is associated with chronic illness. In some embodiments,
wasting diseases or disorders, such as cachexia; malnutrition, tuberculosis, leprosy, diabetes,
renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, end stage renal failure,
sarcopenia, emphysema, osteomalacia, or cardiomyopathy, may be treated by the methods of
this invention. In some embodiments, wasting is due to infection with enterovirus, Epstein-Ban
virus, herpes zoster, HIV, trypanosomes, influenze, coxsackie, rickettsia, trichinella,
schistosoma or mycobacteria, and this invention, in some embodiments, provides methods of
treatment thereof.
[0138] Cachexia is weakness and a loss of weight caused by a disease or as a side effect of
illness. Cardiac cachexia, i.e. a muscle protein wasting of both the cardiac and skeletal muscle,
is a characteristic of congestive heart failure. Cancer cachexia is a syndrome that occurs in
patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies and is manifested by weight loss with

                                                  37
massive depletion of both adipose tissue and lean muscle mass. Cachexia is also seen in
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated
myopathy and/or muscle weakness/wasting is a relatively common clinical manifestation of
AIDS. Individuals with HIV-associated myopathy or muscle weakness or wasting typically
experience significant weight loss, generalized or proximal muscle weakness, tenderness, and

[0140] In a further aspect, the disorder or condition of the method of the present invention is
cancer in a subject, including, but not limited to, reduction of incidence or severity or
pathogenesis of a cancer in a subject, delaying progression, prolonging remission or delaying
onset of cancer in a subject. In some embodiments, such cancers are hormone-dependent or
associated with reproductive tissue in males or females, such as cancer of the prostate, ovary,

                                                  38
breast, uterus, testicle, or others. In one embodiment, the method provides for the treatment of
a precancerous precursor or lesion in a subject and/or reduction of incidence of precancerous
precursors or lesions in a subject. In some embodiments, such precancerous precursors are
found in hormone-responsive tissue or are associated with reproductive tissue in males or
females, such as in the prostate, ovary, breast, uterus, testicle, or others. In some
embodiments, such precancerous precursors comprise any local intraepithelial neoplasia, for
example, of the prostate, the cervix, etc. In some embodiments, such methods are useful in
treating neoplasia or pre-neoplasia, dysplasia or hyperplasia in a tissue, such as in reproductive
tissue in males or females. In one embodiment, the cancer is prostate cancer.
[0141] In one embodiment, the method provides for treating and/or preventing, including
reducing the severity of, reducing the incidence of, delaying the onset of, lung cancer, which in
one preferred embodiment is non-small cell lung cancer. In another aspect, the method
provides for treating and/or preventing, including reducing the severity of, reducing the
incidence of, delaying the onset of, cachexia or other conditions arising as a result of lung
cancer in the subject, which in one preferred embodiment is non-small cell lung cancer. In
another aspect, the method provides for treating and/or preventing, including reducing the
severity of, reducing the incidence of, or reducing pathogenesis of, cancer. In another
embodiment, the cancer, includes but is not limited to, androgen AR dependent tumors
(malignant or benign) such as prostate cancer, breast cancer (male or female, operable or
inoperable), bladder cancers; brain cancers; bone tumors, colon cancer, endometrial cancer,
liver cancer, lung cancer, lymphatic cancer, kidney cancer, osteosarcoma cancer, ovarian
cancer, pancreas cancer, penis cancer, skin cancer, thyroid cancer; and/or hormone-dependent
cancers.
[0142] In one embodiment, the disorder or condition assodicated with the methods provided
herein are reducing cancer metastases to the bone, such as in terms of number of foci, the size
of foci, or a combination thereof.
[0143] In another aspect, the disorder or condition associated with the methods herein is
benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). "BPH (benign prostate hyperplasia)" is a nonmalignant
enlargement of the prostate gland, and is the most common non-malignant proliferative
abnormality found in any internal organ and the major cause of morbidity in the adult male. BPH
occurs in over 75% of men over 50 years of age, reaching 88% prevalence by the ninth decade.
BPH frequently results in a gradual squeezing of the portion of the urethra which traverses the
prostate (prostatic urethra). This causes patients to experience a frequent urge to urinate
because of incomplete emptying of the bladder and urgency of urination. The obstruction of
urinary flow can also lead to a general lack of control over urination, including difficulty initiating
urination when desired, as well as difficulty in preventing urinary flow because of the inability to
empty urine from the bladder, a condition known as overflow urinary incontinence, which can
lead to urinary obstruction and to urinary failure. Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention

                                                   39
includes the method for treating and/or preventing benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) in a
subject. Another embodiment includes a method for treating and/or preventing, including all
embodiments encompassed by the term, prostatitis.
[0144] According to a further aspect, the disorder or condition of the methods of treatment
and/or prevention herein is one or more symptoms associated with a respiratory tract disease in
a subject. Such respiratory tract diseases include, but are not limited to, airway obstruction,
apnea, asbestosis, asthma, atelectasis, berylliosis, bronchial diseases, bronchiectasis,
bronchiolitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchopulmonary
dysplasia, common cold, cough, empyema, pleural, epiglottitis, hemoptysis, hypertension,
pulmonary, hyperventilation, Kartagener syndrome, lung abscess, lung diseases, meconium
aspiration syndrome, pleural effusion, pleurisy, pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary alveolar
proteinosis, pulmonary disease, chronic obstructive, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism,
pulmonary emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, respiratory distress syndrome, newborn-respiratory
hypersensitivity, respiratory tract infections, rhinoscleroma, scimitar syndrome, severe acute
respiratory syndrome, silicosis, sleep apnea, central stridor, tracheal stenosis, Wegener's
granulomatosis, or whooping cough.
[0145] According to another aspect, the disorder or condition of the methods of treatment
and/or prevention, including reducing the incidence, delaying the onset or progression, or
reducing and/or abrogating, is the symptoms associated with an otorhinolaryngologic disease in
a subject, such otorhinolaryngologic diseases, include, but are not limited to, cholesteatoma,
middle ear, croup, deafness, epistaxis, hearing loss, hyperacusis, labyrinthitis, laryngitis,
laryngomalacia, laryngostenosis, mastoiditis, Meniere's disease, nasal obstruction, nasal
polyps, otitis, otorhinolaryngologic diseases, otosclerosis, pharyngitis, presbycusis,
retropharyngeal abscess, rhinitis, sinusitis, tinnitus, tonsillitis, tympanic membrane perforation,
vestibular neuronitis, vocal cord paralysis, or voice disorders.
[0146] According to a further aspect, the disorder or condition associated with the methods of
the invention herein is the treatment or prevention of diseases or disorders caused by, or
associated with a hormonal disorder, disruption or imbalance. In particular, in one embodiment,
the hormonal disorder, disruption or imbalance comprises an excess of a hormone. In another
embodiment, the hormonal disorder, disruption or imbalance comprises a deficiency of a
hormone. In one embodiment, the hormone is a steroid hormone. In another embodiment, the
hormone is an estrogen. In another embodiment, the hormone is an androgen. In another
embodiment, the hormone is a glucocorticoid. In another embodiment, the hormone is a
cortico-steroid. In another embodiment, the hormone is Luteinizing Hormone (LH). In another
embodiment, the hormone is Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH). In another embodiment, the
hormone is any other hormone known in the art. In another embodiment, the hormonal
disorder, disruption or imbalance is associated with menopause. In another embodiment, the
hormonal disorder, disruption or imbalance is associated with andropause, andropausal

                                                  40
vasomotor symptoms, andropausal gynecomastia, muscle strength and/or function, bone
strength and/or function and anger. In another embodiment, hormone deficiency is a result of
specific manipulation, as a byproduct of treating a disease or disorder in the subject. For
example, the hormone deficiency may be a result of androgen depletion in a subject, as a
therapy for prostate cancer in the subject. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment
of the present invention.
[0147] According to another aspect, the disorder or condition associated with the methods of
the invention herein is the treatment or prevention of, including reversing the adverse effects of,
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The present invention further provides a method for the
reversal, treatment, or prevention of the adverse effects of ADT in a patient comprising
administering to a patient in need of such treatment or prevention an effective amount of a
compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
[0148] In one embodiment of this invention, a method is provided for hormone replacement
therapy in a patient (i.e., one suffering from an androgen-dependent condition). For example,
androgen-dependent conditions which may be treated with the compounds and/or compositions
as herein described, comprising the methods of the present invention include those conditions
which are associated with aging, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, diminished erythropoiesis,
osteoporosis, and any other conditions dependent upon low androgen (e.g., testosterone) or
estrogen levels. In one embodiment, the Androgen-dependent conditions that may be treated
with the compounds and/or compositions as herein described, may comprise conditions
characterized by elevated androgen or estrogen levels, including hirsutism, infertility, polycystic
ovarian syndrome, endometrial carcinoma, breast cancer, male pattern baldness, prostate
cancer, testicular cancer, and others, as will be known to one skilled in the art. For such
conditions, the subject may be administered a SARM as herein described, alone or in
combination with another therapeutic agent, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.
[0149] Studies involving patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI) have shown that central
neurotransmitters may be altered after SCI causing hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis
dysfunction, whose disruption led to a significant decrease in testosterone and other hormone
levels. SCI or other acute illness or trauma characteristically includes heightened catabolism in
conjunction with the lowered anabolic activity resulting in a condition that is prone to loss of lean
body tissue, which is often accompanied by disturbed nutrient utilization. The effects of the loss
of lean body mass include the development of wounds and impaired healing mechanisms,
further compounding the problem. Because of poor nutrition and protein combined with
immobilization, patients with spinal cord injury are at high risk for bed sores.
[0150] In another aspect, the disorder or condition associated with the methods herein is the
treatment of a wide variety of injuries of the CNS. CNS injury may refer, in one embodiment, to
a breakdown of the membrane of a nerve cell, or, in another embodiment, to the inability of the
nerve to produce and propagate nerve impulses, or in another embodiment, to the death of the

                                                   41
cell. An injury includes damage that directly or indirectly affects the normal functioning of the
CNS. The injury may be a structural, physical, or mechanical impairment and may be caused
by physical impact, as in the case of a crushing, compression, or stretching of nerve fibers.
Alternatively, the cell membrane may be destroyed by or degraded by an illness, a chemical
imbalance, or a physiological malfunction such as anoxia (e.g., stroke), aneurysm, or
reperfusion. A CNS injury includes, for example and without limitation, damage to retinal
ganglion cells, a traumatic brain injury, a stroke-related injury, a cerebral aneurism-related
injury, a spinal cord injury, including monoplegia, diplegia, paraplegia, hemiplegia and
quadriplegia, a neuroproliferative disorder, or neuropathic pain syndrome. With injury to the
spinal cord of a mammal, connections between nerves in the spinal cord are broken. Such
injuries block the flow of nerve impulses for the nerve tracts affected by the injury, with a
resulting impairment to both sensory and motor function. Injuries to the spinal cord may arise
from compression or other contusion of the spinal cord, or a crushing or severing of the spinal
cord. A severing of the spinal cord, also referred to herein as a "transection," may be a
complete severing or, may be an incomplete severing of the spinal cord. In some
embodiments, injuries or damage to the CNS may be associated with muscle wasting disorders.
Injuries or damage to the CNS can be, for example, caused by diseases, trauma or chemicals.
Examples are central nerve injury or damage, peripheral nerve injury or damage and spinal cord
injury or damage. These include, but are not limited to, cranial nerve diseases such as bell
palsy, cranial nerve diseases, facial hemiatrophy, facial neuralgia, glossopharyngeal nerve
diseases, Moebius syndrome, or trigeminal neuralgia.
[0151] In some embodiments, demyelinating diseases comprise adrenoleukodystrophy,
alexander disease, canavan disease, demyelinating disease, diffuse cerebral sclerosis of
schilder, leukodystrophy-globoid cell, leukodystrophy-metachromatic, multiple sclerosis, or
neuromyelitis optica. In some embodiments, nervous system malformations comprise Arnold
Chiari malformation, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, encephalocele, hereditary motor and

[0161] In another aspect, the invention provides for the treatment and/or prevention of a
dermatological disorder, such as a wound or a burn. In some embodiments, wounds and/or
ulcers are found protruding from the skin or on a mucosal surface or as a result of an infarction
in an organ. A wound may be a result of a soft tissue defect or a lesion or of an underlying
condition. In one embodiment, the term "wound" denotes a bodily injury with disruption of the
normal integrity of tissue structures. The term is also intended to encompass the terms "sore",
"lesion", "necrosis" and "ulcer". In one embodiment, the term "sore" refers to any lesion of the
skin or mucous membranes and the term "ulcer" refers to a local defect, or excavation, of the
surface of an organ or tissue, which is produced by the sloughing of necrotic tissue. Lesion
generally relates to any tissue defect. Necrosis is related to dead tissue resulting from infection,
injury, inflammation or infarctions. All of these are encompassed by the term "wound", which
denotes any wound at any particular stage in the healing process including the stage before any
healing has initiated or even before a specific wound like a surgical incision is made
(prophylactic treatment).
[0162] Examples of wounds which can be prevented and/or treated in accordance with the
present invention are, e.g., aseptic wounds, contused wounds, incised wounds, lacerated
wounds, non-penetrating wounds (i.e. wounds in which there is no disruption of the skin but
there is injury to underlying structures), open wounds, penetrating wounds, perforating wounds,
puncture wounds, septic wounds, subcutaneous wounds, etc. Examples of sores are bed sores,
canker sores, chrome sores, cold sores, pressure sores etc. Examples of ulcers are, e.g.,
peptic ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, gouty ulcer, diabetic ulcer, hypertensive ischemic
ulcer, stasis ulcer, ulcus cruris (venous ulcer), sublingual ulcer, submucous ulcer, symptomatic
ulcer, trophic ulcer, tropical ulcer, veneral ulcer, e.g. caused by gonorrhoea (including urethritis,
endocervicitis and proctitis). Conditions related to wounds or sores which may be successfully
treated according to the invention are burns, anthrax, tetanus, gas gangrene, scalatina,
erysipelas, sycosis barbae, folliculitis, impetigo contagiosa, or impetigo bullosa, etc. There is
often a certain overlap between the use of the terms "wound" and "ulcer" and "wound" and
"sore" and, furthermore, the terms are often used at random. Therefore as mentioned above, in
the present context the term "wounds" encompasses the term "ulcer", "lesion", "sore" and
"infarction", and the terms are indiscriminately used unless otherwise indicated.
[0163] The kinds of wounds to be treated according to the invention also include, but are not
limited to, i) general wounds such as, e.g., surgical, traumatic, infectious, ischemic, thermal,
chemical and bullous wounds; ii) wounds specific for the oral cavity such as, e.g., post
extraction wounds, endodontic wounds especially in connection with treatment of cysts and
abscesses, ulcers and lesions of bacterial, viral or autoimmunological origin, mechanical,
chemical, thermal, infectious and lichenoid wounds; herpes ulcers, stomatitis aphthosa, acute

                                                  47
necrotising ulcerative gingivitis and burning mouth syndrome are specific examples; and iii)
wounds on the skin such as, e.g., neoplasm, burns (e.g. chemical, thermal), lesions (bacterial,
viral, autoimmunological), bites and surgical incisions. Another way of classifying wounds is as
i) small tissue loss due to surgical incisions, minor abrasions and minor bites, or as ii) significant
tissue loss. The latter group includes ischemic ulcers, pressure sores, fistulae, lacerations,
severe bites, thermal burns and donor site wounds (in soft and hard tissues) and infarctions. In
other aspects of the invention, the wound to be prevented and/or treated is selected from the
group consisting of aseptic wounds, infarctions, contused wounds, incised wounds, lacerated
wounds, non-penetrating wounds, open wounds, penetrating wounds, perforating wounds,
puncture wounds, septic wounds and subcutaneous wounds. Other wounds which are of
importance in connection with the present invention are wounds like ischemic ulcers, pressure
sores, fistulae, severe bites, thermal burns and donor site wounds.
[0164] In another aspect, the invention provides for the use of the SARM compounds as
described herein and/or compositions are useful in wound healing as an adjunct to physical
therapy/rehabilitation, as an anabolic agent. In another embodiment, the methods and
compositions as described herein are useful in promoting healing of anterior cruciate ligament
(ACL) or medial cruciate ligament (MCL) injuries, or accelerating recovery after ACL or MCL
surgery. In another embodiment, the methods and compositions as described herein are useful
in enhancing athletic performance. In another embodiment, the methods and compositions as
described herein are useful in treating burns. In another embodiment, the methods and
compositions as described herein are useful in stimulating cartilage regrowth. In another
embodiment, the methods and compositions as described herein are useful in preventing,
treating, or reversing of catabolism associated with prolonged critical illness, pulmonary
dysfunction, ventilator dependency, aging, AIDS, trauma, surgery, congestive heart failure,
cardiac myopathy, burns, cancer, COPD. In another embodiment, the methods and
compositions as described herein are useful in preventing or reversing protein catabolism due
to trauma. In another embodiment, the methods and compositions as described herein are
useful as a) adjunct to cauterization therapy (laser or radio) as is used in surgery to promote
wound healing, b) adjunct to cryotherapy to promote wound healing, c) adjunct to chemotherapy
to prevent side effects such as alopecia, hypogonadism, muscle wasting, osteopenia,
osteoporosis, sarcopenia, increased LDL, TG or total cholesterol, decreased HDL. In another
embodiment, the compositions as described herein are useful in chronic catabolic state (coma,
wasting conditions, starvation, eating disorders); concomitant bone fracture and muscle
damage; critical illness in which muscle or bone wasting are apparent; and/or connective tissue
diseases and disorders Ischemic ulcers and pressure sores are wounds, which normally only
heal very slowly and especially in such cases an improved and more rapid healing is of course
of great importance for the patient. Furthermore, the costs involved in the treatment of patients

                                                  48
suffering from such wounds are markedly reduced when the healing is improved and takes
place more rapidly.
[0165] Donor site wounds are wounds which e.g. occur in connection with removal of hard
tissue from one part of the body to another part of the body e.g. in connection with
transplantation. The wounds resulting from such operations are very painful and an improved
healing is therefore most valuable. The term "skin" is used in a very broad sense embracing the
epidermal layer of the skin and in those cases where the skin surface is more or less injured
also the dermal layer of the skin. Apart from the stratum corneum, the epidermal layer of the
skin is the outer (epithelial) layer and the deeper connective tissue layer of the skin is called the
dermis.
[0166] In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method for promoting healing of
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or medial cruciate ligament (MCL) injuries, or accelerating
recovery after ACL or MCL surgery. In some embodiments, burns are associated with reduced
testosterone levels, and hypgonadism is associated with delayed wound healing. In one
embodiment, the methods of this invention, provide for treating a subject suffering from a wound
or a burn.
[0167] In another asepct, the disorder or condition associated with methods of the invention
includes treating and/or preventing, including reducing the incidence, delaying the onset or

symptoms associated with a hypogonadal state in a subject. In some embodiments,
hypogonadism is caused by treatments which alter the secretion of hormones from the sex
glands in both women and men. In some embodiments, hypogonadism may be "primary" or
"central." In primary hypogonadism, the ovaries or testes themselves do not function properly.
In some embodiments, hypogonadism may be induced by surgery, radiation, genetic and
developmental disorders, liver and kidney disease, infection, or certain autoimmune disorders.
In some embodiments, menopause is a form of hypogonadism. Menopause may cause, in
some embodiments, amenorrhea, hot flashes, vaginal dryness, or irritability due to woman's
estrogen levels fall. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention is the treatment of or reduction
in symptoms of menopause.
[0171] In another embodiment, the invention is directed to the treatment of cystic fibrosis and
induced hypogonadal states as a result of cystic fibrosis; epilepsy and induced hypogonadal
and/or hypermetabolic states as a result of the same; hereditary angioedema, lupus
erythematosus and decreased BMD as a result of the same; as well as other hypogonadal

aware, knowing, thinking, learning and judging. Cognition is related to the fields of psychology,
linguistics, computer science, neuroscience, mathematics, ethology and philosophy. In one
embodiment, "mood" refers to a temper or state of the mind. As contemplated herein, alterations
mean any change for the positive or negative, in cognition and/or mood.
[0180] In one embodiment the mental disorder is depression.
[0181] In one embodiment the mental disorder is an alteration in cognition or a cognitive
disorder.
[0182] In a further asepct, the disorder or condition associated with methods of the invention
includes treating and/or preventing, including reducing the incidence, delaying the onset or

[0183] In another asepct, the disorder or condition associated with methods of the invention
includes treating and/or preventing, including reducing the incidence, delaying the onset or
progression, or reducing and/or abrogating the symptoms associated with, a kidney disease in a
subject.. In some embodiments, kidney diseases comprise acromegaly, acute renal failure
(ARF) amyloidosis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, kidney stones, kidney cysts,
autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, chronic renal failure (CRF), chronic renal
disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), coffin-Lowry syndrome, cor pulmonale,

syndrome, thromboembolism, toxoplasmosis, urinary tract infections, uremia, vesicoureteral
reflux, or williams syndrome. In some embodiments, the kidney disease being treatment
comprises kidney metabolic syndrome. In one embodiment, the kidney disease or disorder is
acute, or in another embodiment, chronic. In one embodiment, clinical indications of a kidney
disease or disorder, wherein the methods of treatment may be useful include urinary casts,
measured GFR, or other markers of renal function. In one embodiment, the kidney disease or
disorder is a chronic kidney disease (CKD). In some embodiments treating CKD patients
includes treating those with advanced disease (uremia), and may comprise treating muscle
wasting, repetitive catabolic stimuli (chronic infections, dialysis), anorexia, or other associated
conditions, which will comprise what is meant by treating the disease.
[0184] CKD predisposes the subject to functional impairment, which in turn may result in the
presence of a chronic inflammatory state, local and systemic inflammatory effects, increased
adiposity (e.g. visceral adipose tissue), decreased LBM and/or any adverse effects of adipose
tissue. In some embodiments, conventional therapies such as the administration of anabolic
hormones lose efficacy in such subjects, as a result of resistance to the anabolic hormones
resulting in decreased levels and resistance to actions (for example due to uremic toxins),
however, the compounds/compositions of this invention may in some embodiments be effective
in such a scenario. In one embodiment, the invention is useful in improving Stage 3 and 4
CKD, by, inter alia, and in some embodiments, increasing lean body mass (LBM), improving
physical performance, increasing quality of life, decreasing adiposity, improving physical
performance, decreasing muscle catabolism, improving or treating renal metabolic syndrome,
decreasing risk for development of insulin resistance and/or decreasing the risk for heart
disease.

                                                  54
[0185] In another aspect, the invention provides for improving muscle wasting and physical
performance in end-stage renal disease (dialysis) patients. In some embodiments, the treatment
methods of this invention are useful in treating uremic cachexia and/or complications, diseases
and/or conditions associated thereto. The compounds of the invention are anticipated to be
useful in subjects predisposed to kidney diseases or disorders. In one embodiment, the phrase
"predisposed to a kidney disease or disorder" with respect to a subject is synonymous with the
phrase "subject at risk", and includes a subject at risk of acute or chronic renal failure, or at risk
of the need for renal replacement therapy, if the subject is reasonably expected to suffer a
progressive loss of renal function associated with progressive loss of functioning nephron units.
Whether a particular subject is at risk is a determination which may routinely be made by one of
ordinary skill in the relevant medical or veterinary art.
[0186] In particular, in one embodiment, the method provides for the treatment of subjects with
kidney disease, in particular male subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) suffer from
hypogonadism, with some having concomitant moderate to severe protein-energy malnutrition
(PEM), which leads to higher required doses of EPO, lower QOL scores, and higher mortality.
Many have other symptoms associated with hypogonadism, including fatigue, lack of apetite,
muscle weakness, etc. In some embodiments, the treatment methods of this invention are
useful in treating symptoms associated with hypogonadism, brought about in the subject by the
kidney disease or disorder. In another embodiment, the invention is directed to female patients
having an androgen deficiency (ADIF); androgen deficiency in aging male (ADAM), including
fatigue, depression, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, decreased cognition, decreased
mood; androgen insufficiency (male or female), androgen deficiency (male or female).
[0187] Diabetic nephropathy is a complication of diabetes that evolves early, typically before
clinical diagnosis of diabetes is made. The earliest clinical evidence of nephropathy is the
appearance of low but abnormal levels (>30 mg/day or 20 pg/min) of albumin in the urine
(microalbuminuria), followed by albuminuria (>300 mg/24 h or 200 pg/min) that develops over a
period of 10-15 years. In patients with type 1 diabetes, diabetic hypertension typically becomes
manifest early on, by the time that patients develop microalbuminuria. Once overt nephropathy
occurs, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls over a course of times, which may be several
years, resulting in End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) in diabetic individuals. Accordingly, in one
embodiment, the invention provides for the treatment of renal disease. Muscle wasting can
occur as a result of pathology, disease, condition or disorders, including disorders for treatment
via the methods of this invention, such as, for example, end stage renal failure.
[0188] The term "diabetes", in one embodiment, refers to a relative or absolute lack of insulin
leading to uncontrolled carbohydrate metabolism. Most patients can be clinically classified as
having either insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM or Type-I diabetes) or non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM or Type-Il diabetes). The term "increased blood pressure"
or "hypertension" refers, in other embodiments, to a repeatedly high blood pressure above 140

                                                 55
over 90 mmHg. Chronically-elevated blood pressure can cause blood vessel changes in the
back of the eye, thickening of the heart muscle, kidney failure, and brain damage. The term
"stroke" refers, in other embodiments, to damage to nerve cells in the brain due to insufficient
blood supply often caused by a bursting blood vessel or a blood clot. The term "heart disease",
in other embodiments, refers to a malfunction in the heart normal function and activity, including
heart failure.
[0189] In another aspect, the disorder or condition associated with the method described herein
is stress urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence is commonly defined as the unintentional
passing of urine. Urinary incontinence is usually deivided into two sub-categories, stress
incontinence and urge incontince. In general, stress incontinence is associated with
sympotoms of unintentional passing of urine, even small amounts of urine, when intra
abdominal pressure is increased, or when the bladder is placed under increased pressure, for
example, but not limited to, when the patients coughs, sneezes, exercises, laughs or lifts
something heavy. In one aspect, the disorder or contindition associated with the methods
described herein includes stress urinary incontinence in female patients. In one embodiment,
the present invention provides a method for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence. In one
embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of stress urinary
incontinence in a female patient.
[0190] In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method for prevention of statin
induced rhabdomyolysis. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method for
prevention of statin induced rhabdomyolysis, organ failure or insufficiency. In some
embodiments, the present invention provides a method for prevention of statin induced kidney
or liver failure or insufficiency.
[0191] In another aspect, the disorder or condition associated with methods of the invention
includes treating and/or preventing, promoting or speeding recovery following a surgical
procedure, reducing a fat mass in a subject, for treating adominal fat accumulation; improving
body composition; lowering body fat content; lowering fat mass; improving blood lipid profile,
increasing muscle mass/strength/function; increasing bone mass/BMD/strength/function;
congenital hyperinsulinemia; cushing's disease (hypercortisolemia); obesity, diabetes or other
diseases or conditions associated with a metabolic syndrome in a subject in need thereof.
[0192] The term "obesity" is defined, in one embodiment, as an increase in body weight beyond
the limitation of skeletal and physical requirement, as the result of excessive accumulation of fat
in the body. The term "obesity-associated metabolic disorder" refers, in one embodiment, to a
disorder which results from, is a consequence of, is exacerbated by or is secondary to obesity.
Non-limiting examples of such a disorder are osteoarthritis, Type || diabetes mellitus, increased
blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease.
[0193] The phrase "treating atherosclerosis and its associated diseases," means diseases such
as, for example, cardiovascular disorders, cerebrovascular disorders, peripheral vascular

                                                   56

[0278] In one embodiment, the present invention provides combined preparations. In one
embodiment, the term "a combined preparation" defines especially a "kit of parts" in the sense
that the combination partners as defined above can be dosed independently or by use of
different fixed combinations with distinguished amounts of the combination partners i.e.,
simultaneously, concurrently, separately or sequentially. In some embodiments, the parts of the
kit of parts can then, e.g., be administered simultaneously or chronologically staggered, that is
at different time points and with equal or different time intervals for any part of the kit of parts.
The ratio of the total amounts of the combination partners, in some embodiments, can be
administered in the combined preparation. In one embodiment, the combined preparation can
be varied, e.g., in order to cope with the needs of a patient subpopulation to be treated or the
needs of the single patient which different needs can be due to a particular disease, severity of
a disease, age, sex, or body weight as can be readily made by a person skilled in the art. Thus,
a kit of the invention comprises two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one
of which contains a compound of Formula 1, 2 or 3, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof, at least a second of which comprises a second pharmaceutically active ingredient, or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and means for separately retaining said compositions,
such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the
familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like. Such a kit is
particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral,
for administering separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the
separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically comprises
directions for administration and may be provided with a so-called memory aid.

[0283] This invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of
Formula 1, Formula 2 or Formula 3, as defined herein or pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof as defined above; a second pharmaceutically active ingredient, or pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.
[0284] Second pharmaceutically active ingredients useful in the compositions of the present
invention include those embodiments and preferred embodiments of second pharmaceutically
active ingredients disclosed herein.
[0285] As used herein the term "excipient" is taken to mean any ingredient in the
pharmaceutical composition other than the compound of Formula 1, Formula 2 or Formula 3, or
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as defined above; a second pharmaceutically active
ingredient, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The choice of excipient will depend to a
large extent on factors such as the particular mode of administration, the effect of the excipient
on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosage form, which factors are well known to the
person skilled in the art. The term "excipient" encompasses diluent, carrier or adjuvant.
[0286] Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for the delivery of a compound of Formula 1,
Formula 2 or Formula 3, as defined herein, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as
defined above; a second pharmaceutically active ingredient, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof and methods for their preparation can be readily determined by one skilled in the art.
Such compositions and methods for preparation may be found, for example, in Remington's
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 19th Edition (Mack Publishing Company, 1995).
[0287] Preferred pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are those suitable for
oral administration. Oral administration may involve swallowing, so that the pharmaceutically
active ingredient enters the gastrointestinal tract, or alternatively, oral administration may
involve buccal or sublingual administration by which the pharmaceutically active ingredient
enters the blood stream directly from the mouth. Formulations suitable for oral administration
include solid formulations such as tablets, capsules containing particulates, liquids, or powders,

                                                  89
lozenges (including liquid filled), chews, multi- and nano-particulates, gels, solid solution,
liposomes, films, ovules, sprays and liquid formulations.
[0288] Tablet formulations suitable for oral administration usually comprise from about 0.1%
w/w to about 80% w/w of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, dependent on dose, more
typically from 5% w/w to about 60% w/w of the dosage form. One of ordinary skill will
appreciate that one of the factors to consider when determining the level of active
pharmaceutical ingredient suitable for inclusion in a tablet for oral administration is that needed
to ensure adequate patient dosing. For example, when dealing with an active ingredient which
is potent or highly potent, tablet formulations suitable for oral administration may comprise a
lower amount of active pharmaceutical ingredient, for example from about 0.1% w/w to about
20%w/w of the active pharmaceutical ingredient.
[0289] In addition to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, tablets suitable for oral administration
also comprise one or more of the following excipients. Tablets generally contain a disintegrant.
Examples of disintegrants include sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose,
calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polyvinylpyrrolidone,
methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, lower alkyl-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose,
starch, pregelatinized starch and sodium alginate. Generally, the disintegrant will comprise
from about 1% w/w to about 25% w/w. In one embodiment of the present invention, the
disintegrant will comprise from about 5% w/w to about 20% w/w of the dosage form. Binders
are generally used to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet formulation. Suitable binders include
microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, sugars, polyethylene glycol, natural and synthetic gums,
polyvinylpyrrolidone, pregelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose. Tablets may also contain diluents, such as lactose (monohydrate, spray-dried
monohydrate, anhydrous and the like), mannitol, xylitol, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol,
microcrystalline cellulose, starch and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate. Tablets may also
optionally comprise surface active agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate 80,
and glidants such as silicon dioxide and talc. When present, surface active agents may
comprise from about 0.2% w/w to about 5% w/w of the tablet, and glidants may comprise from
about 0.2% w/w to about 1% w/w of the tablet. Tablets also generally contain lubricants such
as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate, and mixtures
of magnesium stearate with sodium lauryl sulfate. Lubricants generally comprise from about
0.25% w/w to about 10% w/w. In one embodiment of the present invention, lubricants comprise
from about 0.5% w/w to about 3% w/w of the tablet. Other possible ingredients include anti
oxidants, colorants, flavoring agents, preservatives and taste-masking agents.
[0290] For example, exemplary tablet formulations comprise up to about 80% w/w of the active
pharmaceutical ingredient, from about 0% w/w to about 90% w/w binder, from about 0% w/w to
about 95% w/w diluent, from about 1% w/w to about 25% w/w disintegrant, and from about
0.25% w/w to about 10% w/w lubricant.

                                                  90
[0291] Tablet blends may be compressed directly or by roller to form tablets. Tablet blends, or
portions of blends, may alternatively be wet-, dry-, or melt-granulated, melt congealed, or
extruded before tableting. The final formulation may comprise one or more layers, and may be
coated or uncoated; it may even be encapsulated. Formulations of tablets are discussed in
Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, Vol. 1, by H. Lieberman and L. Lachman (Marcel
Dekker, New York, 1980).
[0292] When preparing pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, it may be
necessary to adjust the particle volume mean diameter and/or the particle size distribution of the
crystalline active pharmaceutical ingredient to further optimise its physicochemical properties or
other properties such as stability manufacturability and/or bioperformance. For example, in
some cases there may be a desire to reduce the particle size to increase the rate of dissolution.
Particle size reduction is also sometimes used to ensure content uniformity for formulations
which have very low loading of active pharmaceutical ingredients. For the present invention it is
preferred that the crystalline form of the active pharmaceutical ingredient has a volume mean
diameter of no more than 50pm and a particle size distribution such that 95% of the sample
volume particles have a diameter of no more than 130pm, as measured by laser diffraction, with
dry dispersion, using standard techniques.
[0293] Formulations suitable for oral administration also include fast-dissolving or fast
disintegrating dose forms such as those described in Expert Opinion in Therapeutic Patents,
11(6), 981-986 by Lang and Chen (2001).
[0294] Solid formulations for oral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or
modified release. Modified release includes delayed, sustained, pulsed, controlled, targeted
and programmed release. Suitable modified release formulations for the purposes of the
invention are described in US Patent No. 6,106,864. Details of other suitable release
technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles are to be found
in Pharmaceutical Technology On-line, 25(2), 1-14, by Verma et al. (2001). The use of chewing
gum to achieve controlled release is described in WO-A-00/35298.
[0295] Other pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for oral
administration include consumable oral films. These are typically pliable water-soluble or water
swellable thin film dosage forms which may be rapidly dissolving or mucoadhesive and typically
comprise a film-forming polymer, a binder, a solvent, a humectant, a plasticizer, a stabilizer or
emulsifier, a viscosity-modifying agent and a solvent. Some components of the formulation may
perform more than one function. The film-forming polymer may be selected from natural
polysaccharides, proteins, or synthetic hydrocolloids and, when included in a composition, the
film forming polymer is typically present in the range of about 0.01% w/w to about 99% w/w,
more typically in the range of about 30% w/w to about 80% w/w. Other possible ingredients
include anti-oxidants, colorants, flavorings and flavor enhancers, preservatives, salivary
stimulating agents, cooling agents, co-solvents (including oils), emollients, bulking agents, anti-

                                                     91
foaming agents, surfactants and taste-masking agents. Films in accordance with the invention
are typically prepared by evaporative drying of thin aqueous films coated onto a peelable
backing support or paper. This may be done in a drying oven or tunnel, typically a combined
coater dryer, or by freeze-drying or vacuuming.
[0296] Other suitable pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention also include liquid
formulations. Liquid formulations include suspensions, solutions, syrups and elixirs. Such
formulations may be employed as fillers in soft or hard capsules and typically comprise a carrier,
for example, water, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, methylcellulose, or a suitable
oil, and one or more emulsifying agents and/or suspending agents. Liquid formulations may
also be prepared by the reconstitution of a solid, for example, from a sachet.
[0297] Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be adapted for
administration of the active directly into the blood stream, into muscle, or into an internal organ.
Such parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal,
intraventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular and subcutaneous
administration. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including
microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques. Suitable pharmaceutical
compositions also include those for topical administration to the skin or mucosa, that is,
dermally or transdermally.
[0298] Yet another suitable pharmaceutical composition of the present invention are those
adapted for intranasal administration or for inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder
(either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component
particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder
inhaler, as an aerosol spray from a pressurized container, pump, spray, atomizer (preferably an
atomizer using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebulizer, with or without the
use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3
heptafluoropropane, or as nasal drops. For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a
bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin. The pressurized container, pump,
spray, atomizer, or nebulizer contains a solution or suspension of the pharmaceutically active
ingredient, which solution or suspension also comprises for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol,
or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilizing, or extending release of the compound,
a propellant as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an
oligolactic acid. Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is
micronized to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5pm). This may be
achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling,
supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenization, or spray
drying. Capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), blisters
and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of
the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a

                                                    92
performance modifier such as -leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be
anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients
include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.
Formulations for intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified
release using, for example, PGLA. Modified release includes delayed, sustained, pulsed,
controlled, targeted and programmed release.
[0299] Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention also include those formulated to
be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronized
suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline.
[0300] Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention optionally comprise flavors.
Suitable flavors, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or
saccharin sodium, may be added.
[0301] Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention optionally also comprise soluble
macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene
glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve the solubility, dissolution rate, taste,
bioavailability and/or stability of the active ingredient when using any of the aforementioned
modes of administration. Drug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally
useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion
complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin
may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e., as a carrier, diluent, or solubilizer. Most commonly
used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be
found in international patent publications WO-A-91/11172, WO-A-94/02518 and WO-A
98/55148.
[0302] Preferred pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are those which are
suitable for oral administration. More preferably pharmaceutical compositions of the present
invention are suitable for oral administration and are in the form of a tablet or a capsule.
[0303] It is to be understood that this invention is directed to combined therapies and
compositions thereof as described herein, for treatment and/or prevention of any disease,
disorder or condition, as appropriate, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, and include
in particular those embodiments and preferred embodiments of disorders and conditions
disclosed herein.
[0304] In another aspect this invention relates to a method for modulating an activity of an
androgen receptor in a subject in need thereof, comprising contacting said androgen receptor
with an effective amount of a combination of a compound of Formula 1, Formula 2 or Formula 3,
as defined herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a second pharmaceutically

[0316] The novel combinations of the present invention are also useful in the field of veterinary
medicine. In addition to use in non-human animals for the uses described hereinabove for
human subjects, the compounds of the present invention are also particularly useful in treating
non-human animals that are being raised for human food consumption. The dosages and
dosage forms described hereinabove for human subjects can be adjusted to accommodate the
varying size of animals, as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the veterinary art.
[0317] This invention also relates to a crystalline form of 6-[(4R)-4-methyl-1,1-dioxido-1,2,6
th iadiazinan-2-yl]isoqu inoline-1 -carbonitrile.
[0318] This invention also relates to a crystalline form of 6-[(4R)-4-methyl-1,1-dioxido-1,2,6

yl]isoquinoline-1-carbonitrile is in its free base form.
[0320] There are a number of analytical methods one of ordinary skill in the art can use to
analyze solid forms, in particular crystalline solid forms. The term "analyze" as used herein shall
be taken to mean to obtain information about the solid state structure of solid forms. For
example, X-ray powder diffraction is one such suitable technique for differentiating amorphous
solid forms from crystalline solid forms and for characterizing and identifying crystalline solid
forms since different crystalline forms exhibit different X-ray powder patterns. A discussion of
the theory of X-ray powder diffraction patterns can be found in Clearfield, Reibenspies and
Bhuvanesh (Editors), Principles and Applications of Powder Diffraction: Edition 1, Wiley, John &
Sons, Incorporated (2008), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[0321] Due to differences in instruments, samples and sample preparation, minor variation in
peak values in spectroscopic techniques can occur. In an X-ray powder diffraction pattern
typical precision of a 2-theta x-axis value of an x-ray powder pattern is of the order of plus or
minus 0.20 2-theta. As such, a peak value reported to be at 9.20 2-theta could occur at any
where between 9.00 2-theta and 9.40 2-theta when measured on most x-ray diffractometers
under most conditions. . In a FT-Raman spectra typical precision of a Raman shift is of the
order of plus or minus 2cm-1. In a solid state NMR the typicial precision of a 13C peak shift is
of the order of plus or minus 0.2ppm.

[0385] The crystalline form of 6-[(4R)-4-methyl-1,1-dioxido-1,2,6-thiadiazinan-2-yl]isoquinoline
1-carbonitrile, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, of the present invention may also be
useful in the field of veterinary medicine. The dosages and dosage forms described
hereinabove for human subjects can be adjusted to accommodate the varying size of animals,
as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the veterinary art. In another aspect, this invention
also provides a method of affecting carcass composition, increasing lean mass, reducing fat
mass, reducing percent fat mass, increasing lean:fat, increasing average daily gain (ADG), or
decreasing feed to gain ratio (F:G) of an animal, or increasing feed efficiency in an animal,
wherein the method comprises administering to the animal an effective amount of a crystalline
form of 6-[(4R)-4-methy-1, 1-dioxido-1,2,6-thiadiazinan-2-yl]isoquinoline-1 -carbonitrile, or a
pharmaceutical composition thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the animal is a cattle or a
swine. The phrase "increasing lean mass" generally refers to increasing muscle in an animal,
which is considered in many cases a more desirable carcass for human food consumption.
"Reducing fat mass" and "reducing percent fat mass" refer to reduction of fat production in an
animal. The phrase "lean:fat", as for example in "increasing lean:fat" refers generally to the ratio
of lean mass in an animal relative to fat mass in the animal. An increased lean:fat in an animal
is in many cases considered to produce a carcass that is more desirable for human food
consumption. The phrase "F:G" refers to the ratio of feed input into an animal relative to weight
gain (output) in the animal. A decrease in F:G increases productivity from an economic view
point. Dosage forms, the effective amount of active ingredient and suitable compositions will be
known to those of ordinary skill can be used for such veterinary applications.
[0386] The crystalline form of 6-[(4R)-4-methyl-1,1-dioxido-1,2,6-thiadiazinan-2-yl]isoquinoline
1-carbonitrile, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, of the present invention may also be
usefully combined with other active pharmaceutical ingredients known in the veterinary fields.
Such combinations may be accomplished by administering a compound of the present invention
to an animal, as described herein, in one dosage form or unit, and administering the second
active pharmaceutical ingredient to the animal separately, in a separate dosage form or unit.
The administration to the animal of the two separate dosage forms may be at the same time or
in any order. In another embodiment, the compound of the present invention and the second
pharmaceutical ingredient (or additional pharmaceutical ingredients) are combined together in
the same dosage form and are administered to the animal together. Examples of compounds
which can be suitably administered with the crystalline compounds of the present invention for
veterinary applications include beta adrenergic agonist or beta adrenergic modulator, antibiotics
or steroids.

Examples
[0388] All the compounds of Formula 1, 2 or 3, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,
can be made by the specific and general experimental procedures described below in
combination with the common general knowledge of one skilled in the art (see, for example,
Comprehensive Organic Chemistry, Ed. Barton and Ollis, Elsevier; Comprehensive Organic
Transformations: A Guide to Functional Group Preparations, Larock, John Wiley and Sons).
[0389] The following non-limiting Preparations and Examples illustrate the preparation of
compounds of the present invention.
[0390] Unless otherwise stated, all starting materials and reagents are commercially available,
or known from literature sources.
[0391] 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were in all cases consistent with the
proposed structures. Characteristic chemical shifts (6) are given in parts-per-million downfield
from tetramethylsilane using conventional abbreviations for designation of major peaks: e.g. s,
singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br, broad. The mass spectra (m/z) were
recorded using either electrospray ionization (ESI) or atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
(APCI). The following abbreviations have been used for common solvents: CDCl3,
deuterochloroform; d6-DMSO, deuterodimethylsulfoxide; CD30D, deuteromethanol; THF,
tetrahydrofuran; DCM, dichloromethane; EtOAc, ethyl acetate; MeOH, methanol; DMF,
dimethylformamide. 'Ammonia' refers to a concentrated solution of ammonia in water
possessing a specific gravity of 0.88. Where thin layer chromatography (TLC) has been used it
refers to silica gel TLC using silica gel 60 F254 plates, Rf is the distance travelled by a
compound divided by the distance travelled by the solvent front on a TLC plate.
Powder X-ray diffraction
[0392] Powder X-ray diffraction analysis was conducted using a Bruker AXS D8 ADVANCE
diffractometer equipped with a Cu radiation source (K-a average). The system is equipped with
a Gobel Mirror and 2.5 axial Soller slits on the primary side. The secondary side utilizes 2.5
axial Soller slits and motorized slits. Diffracted radiation was detected by a Lynx Eye XE
detector. The X-ray tube voltage and amperage were set to 40 kV and 40 mA respectively.
Data was collected in the Theta-2-Theta configuration with a Cu K-alpha (average) wavelength
source scanning from 3.0 to 40.0 degrees 2-Theta using a step size of 0.03 degrees and a step
time of 1.0 seconds, at ambient temperature. Samples were prepared by placing them in a
silicon low background holder and rotated during collection. Data were collected using Bruker
DIFFRAC Plus software (Version 2.0) and analysis was performed by EVA diffract plus software
(Version 3.1).
[0393] PXRD data file was not processed prior to peak searching. Using the peak search
algorithm in the EVA diffract plus software (Version 3.1), peaks were selected with a threshold
value of 1 and a width value of 0.3 were used to make preliminary peak assignments. The
output of automated assignments was visually checked to ensure validity and adjustments

                                                  111
manually made if necessary, in accordance with the routine practice of one of ordinary skill.
Peaks with relative intensity of    10% were generally chosen. The peaks which were not
resolved or were consistent with noise were also discarded. A typical error associated with the
peak position from PXRD is +/- 0.2* 2-theta.
[0394] As used herein the terms "PXRD" and "x-ray powder diffraction pattern" are considered
interchangeable and synonymous with the term "powder X-ray diffraction pattern".
Fourier Transform Raman (FT-Raman)
[0395] FT-Raman spectra analysis was conducted using a Nicolet NXR FT-Raman accessory
attached to the FT-IR bench. The spectrometer was equipped with a 1064 nm Nd:YVO 4 laser
and a liquid nitrogen cooled Germanium detector. Prior to data acquisition, instrument
performance and calibration verifications were conducted using polystyrene. Samples were
analyzed in glass NMR tubes that were spun during spectral collection. The spectra were
collected using 0.5 W of laser power and 512 co-added scans. The collection range was 3700
50 cm-'. The API spectra were recorded using 2 cm-1 resolution, and Happ-Genzel apodization
was utilized for all of the spectra. A typical error associated with the FT-Raman peak shift is
2cm-1 . It is expected that, due to the similarity of FT-Raman and dispersive Raman spectra
techniques, peak positions reported herein obtained using FT-Raman spectroscopy would be
likely to be consistent with those which would be observed using dispersive Raman
spectroscopy assuming appropriate instrument calibration.
Solid State NMR
[0396] Solid State NMR (ssNMR) spectra analysis was conducted at 250C on a Varian 4 mm
CPMAS probe positioned into a Varian VNMR 400 MHz (1H frequency) NMR spectrometer.
The sample was packed into a rotor and the rotor was oriented at the magic angle and spun at
8.0 kHz. The carbon ssNMR spectrum was collected using a proton decoupled cross
polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) experiment with TOSS (Total suppression of
spinning sidebands) spinning sideband suppression. The cross-polarization contact time was
set to 3 ms and the recycle delay to 30 seconds. The carbon spectrum was referenced using
an external standard of crystalline adamantane, setting its downfield resonance to 38.5 ppm (as
determined from neat TMS).
[0397] The ssNMR data file was processed prior to peak searching. Automatic peak picking
was performed using Bruker-BioSpin TopSpin software (Version 3.1). Generally, a threshold
value of 5% relative intensity was used for peak selection. A typical error associated with the
13C chemical shift (ppm) x-axis value for ssNMR
                                                     is 0.2 ppm.
DSC
[0398] DSC measurements were performed with a Discovery DSC (TA instruments) equipped
with a refrigerated cooling accessory. Approximately 2-5 mg of solid sample was weighed into

                                                          112
a standard /Tzero aluminum pan and non-hermetically sealed. The sample was placed in a cell
with continuous dry nitrogen purge (50 mL/min) and heated from 25                    0C to 250 'C at 10 "C/min
heating rate. The cell constant was determined using indium and temperature calibration was
performed using indium and tin as standards. The experimental data were analyzed using
commercially available software (TA Universal Analysis 2000/Trios software, TA Instruments).

1620.0 mmol) and amino acetaldehyde dimethyl acetal (170.4 g, 1620 mmol) in anhydrous
toluene (1.5 L) was refluxed under a Dean-Stark condenser for 12 h. The solution was
concentrated under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in anhydrous THF and cooled to -10
 C. Ethyl chloroformate (193.3 mL, 1782 mmol) was added and stirred for 10 min at -10                     C, and
then allowed to warm to room temperature. Subsequently trimethyl phosphite (249.6 mL, 1782.0
mmol) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture and stirred for 10 h at room temperature.
The solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the residue was dissolved in anhydrous DCM
(1.5 L) and stirred for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0 C, and titanium
tetrachloride (1.2 L, 6480 mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred at 40 OC
for 6 days. The reaction mixture was poured into ice and pH was adjusted to 8 - 9 with aqueous
6N NaOH solution. The suspension was extracted three times with EtOAc. The organic layer
was extracted with 3 M HCI. The acidic aqueous solution was adjusted to pH to 7 - 8 with 3N
NaOH solutions and extracted two times with EtOAc. The organic layer was dried over

                                                 113

temperature, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h. 1N NaOH was added to the stirred
reaction mixture to adjust the pH to 7 - 8. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer
was extracted with DCM. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and
concentrated under reduced pressure to render crude product. The solid product was triturated
with the mixture of n-pentane and ethanol (8:2) to get the #A2 as white solid. Yield: 65 g (60%).

(50.0 mL, 348.0 mmol) in THF (500 mL) at room temperature over a period of 15 minutes. The
reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Water was added to the reaction
mixture, and the solution was extracted with DCM. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous
Na2 SO 4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to give crude product. The product was
purified by column chromatography using silica gel (100 - 200 mesh) with 0 - 4% EtOAc in
petroleum ether as an eluent to give #A3 as white solid. Yield: 41 g (61%). Rf: 0.6 (30% EtOAc

13.1 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution t-BuOH (1.4 mL, 13.1 mmol) in toluene (4.0 mL)
at -5 'C. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes, and then THF (1
mL) was added to the resulting suspension to obtain clear solution. In another flask, DIPEA (2.3
mL, 13.1 mmol) was added to a solution of #D4 (0.6 g, crude 2.6 mmol) in dry THF (3 mL). The
above prepared reagent (CISO 2NH-Boc) was added to this reaction mixture dropwise at room
temperature over a period of 20 minutes. The resulting reaction mixture was then stirred for 16
h at room temperature. The mixture was diluted with EtOAc (100 mL) and washed with water
(100 mL). The aqueous layer was washed with EtOAc (2 x 100 mL), combined all the organic
layers, dried over Na2 SO 4 , concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain the crude product
(LCMS shows desired #D6 and uncyclized #D5. This crude was purified by column
chromatography on 100 - 200 mesh silica gel, using 10 - 30% EtOAc in petroleum ether as an
eluent to obtain desired #D6 (0.35 g, 47.8%), and uncyclized #D5 (0.22 g, crude).
The uncyclized #D5 (0.22 g, crude) was dissolved in THF (1 mL) and DIPEA (0.6 mL) was
added to the solution. The reaction mixture was stirred for another 12 h at room temperature.
After which time, it was diluted with EtOAc (100 mL) and washed with water (100 mL). The
aqueous layer was washed with EtOAc (2 x 100 mL), combined all the organic layers, dried
over Na2 SO 4 , concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain crude product. This crude was
purified by column chromatography on 100 - 200 mesh silica gel, using 10 - 30% EtOAc in
petroleum ether as an eluent to obtain desired #D6 (1.1 g, 13.2%). Total amount of #D6 was
(0.5 g, 60% for two steps, 82% LCMS purity). Rf: 0.8 (60% EtOAc in petroleum ether).
LCMS m/z = 403.1 (M + H). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDC13): 6 1.04 (d, J= 6.8 Hz, 3H), 1.50 (s, 9H),

Step 6. Racemate #D7 and final products (#10, #11). TFA (5 mL) was added to a solution of
#D6 (0.15 g, 0.37 mmol) in DCM (100 mL) at 0 C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at 0
 C. The solution was neutralized with saturated aqueous NaHCO 3 solution at 0 OC. The mixture
was diluted with water, extracted with DCM (3 x 100 mL). The combined organic layers were

                                                 123
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain racemic #D7
(0.10 mg, 73%).
LCMS m/z = 303.0 (M + H). Rf: 0.3 (60% EtOAc in petroleum ether).
Enantiomeric separation: #D7 was submitted for chiral separation to obtain final compounds
#10 (0.015 mg) and #11 (0.016 mg).

Step 1. Synthesis of methyl alanine (#E1). Thionyl chloride (18.4 mL, 252.8 mmol) was added
to a solution of alanine (15.0 g, 168.5 mmol) in methanol at 0 0C. Then, the reaction mixture
was stirred at room temperature for 3 h. After the depletion of the starting material, the reaction
was cooled to 0 C and treated with solid NaHCO 3. The slurry was filtered through Celite T M pad,
and rinsed with MeOH (100 mL). The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to
provide a residue that was diluted with DCM, washed with water, brine, dried and concentrated
to give #E1 (19.0 g, crude). This was used for the next step without further purification. Rf: 0.6
(20% methanol in DCM).

Step 2. Synthesis of aminoalcohol (#E2). A solution of #E1 (19.0 g, 184.5 mmol) in THF (300
mL) was cooled to 0 C, and LiAIH 4 (21.0 g, 553.4 mmol) was added portionwise over 30
minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature till the reaction mixture become
slurry, and then refluxed for 2 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature,
quenched with 2N NaOH solution to pH 7. The solids were filtered through a Celite T M pad and
washed with THF (100 mL x 3). The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give
crude material. The product was purified by neutral alumina column chromatography with 100%
MeOH as an eluting system to give #E2 as a brown liquid (6.0 g, 43%). Rf: 0.1 (20% MeOH in
DCM).

Step 3. Synthesis of 6-amino isoquinoline (#E3). A solution of #A2 (4.0 g, 51.7 mmol), 6
bromoisoquinoline-1-carbonitrile #A3 (6.0 g, 25.9 mmol), BINAP (3.2 g, 5.2 mmol), Pd2(dba) 3
(2.3 g, 2.6 mmol) and potassium phosphate (11.0 g, 51.7 mmol) in anhydrous DMSO (35 mL)
was heated at 80 C for 2 h. The complete disappearance of the 6-bromoisoquinoline-1
carbonitrile #A3 was observed on TLC. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature,
filtered through Celite T M pad and the filtrate was diluted with water (100 mL). The mixture was

followed by TIPS-Cl (27.8 mL, 130.0 mmol). The mixture was allowed to stir at room
temperature for 16 h. After the starting material was consumed, the mixture was quenched with
ice water and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over
Na2 SO 4 , filtered and concentrated to give crude product which was purified by column
chromatography on silica gel (100 - 200 mesh) eluted with 20% EtOAc in petroleum ether to
give pure #L3 (10.0 g, 31%) as pale yellow liquid. Rf: 0.3 (50% EtOAc in petroleum ether,
KMnO 4 active).

added to a stirred solution of #L3 (5.0 g, 18.0 mmol) and DMAP (0.5 g, 4.0 mmol) in acetonitrile
(40 mL) at -30 0C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes and then continued at room
temperature for 16 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to give a
crude product which was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (100 - 200 mesh)
using 10% EtOAc and petroleum ether to afford #H4 (4.5 g, 66%) as a light brown liquid. Rf: 0.6
(30% EtOAc / petroleum ether, KMnO 4 active).
Step 5. Synthesis of methylated N-Boc TIPS protected alcohol (#L5). MeLi (3 M in diethylamine,
2.6 mL, 8.1 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of #L4 (3.0 g, 8.1 mmol) in dry THF (20
mL) at -78 "C and stirring was continued at same at temperature for 4 h. The reaction mixture
was quenched with saturated aqueous NH4 CI solution, extracted with EtOAc, dried over Na2 SO 4
and concentrated to give #L5 (3 g, 96%) as a light brown liquid which was used in next step
without further purification. Rf: 0.2 (30% EtOAc in petroleum ether, KMnO 4 active).
Step 6. Synthesis ofN-Boc alcohol (#H6). A mixture of #L5 (3.5 g, 9.0 mmol) and 10% Pd/C
(1.2 g) in 10% trifluoroacetic acid in methanol (80 mL) was shaken in a Parr apparatus under a
hydrogen atmosphere at 200 psi at room temperature for 24 h. The reaction mixture was filtered
through a Celite TM pad, washed with EtOAc, concentrated under reduced pressure to provide
crude product. Thiswas purified by column chromatography on silica gel (100 - 200 mesh)
using 15% EtOAc / petroleum ether to get #L6 (2 g, 60%) as a yellow liquid. Rf: 0.4 (30%
EtOAc: petroleum ether, KMnO 4 active).
Step 7. Synthesis of amino alcohol trifluoroacetic acid salt (#L7). Trifluoroacetic acid (10.0 mL)
was added dropwise to a solution of #H6 (1.0 g, 4.6 mmol) in DCM (10 mL) at room
temperature, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h. The solvents were evaporated under
reduced pressure to get residue mixture which was co-distilled with methanol and concentrated
under reduced pressure to afford #L7 (1 g, 94%) as a pale yellow liquid. Rf: 0.2 (20% methanol
in DCM, KMnO 4 active).

                                                 147
Step 8. Synthesis of product (#L8). Pd2(dba) 3 (235.0 mg, 0.25 mmol), BINAP (480.0 mg, 0.77
mmol), K3 PO 4 (1.9 g, 9.0 mmol) were added to a mixture of 6-bromoisoquinoline-1-carbonitrile
(600.0 mg, 2.57 mmol) and #L7 (1 g, 4.1 mmol) in DMSO (5 mL) under nitrogen atmosphere.
The reaction mixture was heated to 110 C for 3 h. The mixture was diluted with EtOAc and
washed with water and brine. Organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to give
crude compound. The crude material was purified by column chromatography using silica gel
(100 - 200 mesh) eluted with 40% EtOAc in petroleum ether to get pure #L8 (400 mg, 58 %) as
pale yellow solid. Rf: 0.4 (50% EtOAc in petroleum ether).

#L8 (400 mg, 1.45 mmol) in EtOAc (10 mL) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was
heated to 80 'C for 3 h. The mixture was filtered through a Celite T M pad and washed with
EtOAc. The filtrate was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO 3 solution, dried over Na2 SO4 ,
filtered and concentrated to give #L9 (400 mg crude) as a pale yellow solid. The crude
compound was used in the next step without further purification. Rf: 0.5 (50% EtOAc in
petroleum ether).
Step 10. Synthesis of product (#38). Me 3SiCF 3 (300.0 mg, 2.1 mmol) was added dropwise to a
stirred suspension of #L9 (400 mg, 1.5 mmol) and CsF (1.2 g, 8 mmol) in THF (10 mL) at -78
 C very slowly. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The mixture
was quenched with water and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was dried over Na2 SO4 ,
filtered and concentrated to give a crude diastereomeric mixture. Purification by column
chromatography on silica gel (230 - 400 mesh) and elution with 10% EtOAc in petroleum ether
provided hydroxy center diastereomer (75 mg, 15%) as a pale brown solid. Further elution with
20% EtOAc in petroleum ether gave hydroxy center diastereomer #38 (60 mg, 12%) as off white
solids. Rf: 0.6 (hydroxyl center diastereomer) and 0.7 (#38) (50 % EtOAc in pet ether).

Procedure:
[0399] Into a 2L 3-neck round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser
and thermocouple with heating mantle was placed 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) (10
mL/g; 8.15 moles; 817 mL; 702 g) followed by racemic-2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'
binaphthyl (BINAP) (0.04 equiv (molar); 14.0 mmol; 8.74 g) and
bis(dibenzylideneacetone)palladium (Pd2(dba) 3) (0.04 equiv (molar); 14.0 mmol; 8.07 g). The

                                                  150
mixture was degassed by pulling vacuum and refilling with nitrogen three times then heated to
75  0C for 15 minutes and cooled to ambient temperature. In a separate flask, (S)-3-amino-2
methylpropan-1-ol (1.60 equiv; 561 mmol; 50.0 g, prepared using literature methods for
example as disclosed in EP-A-0,089,139 published on 21" September 1983) was dissolved in
2-methyltetrahydrofuran (5 mL/g; 4.08 moles; 409 mL; 351 g) and degassed by pulling vacuum
and refilling with nitrogen three times. Into the pot containing the catalyst was added 6
(bromoisoquinoline-1-carbonitrile) (1.00 equiv; 351 mmol; 81.75 g) and cesium carbonate (1.6
equiv (molar); 561 mmol; 185 g) in single portions followed by the solution of the aminoalcohol
via addition funnel. The reaction mixture was again degassed by pulling vacuum and refilling
with nitrogen three times. The reaction was heated to 70      0C for 3 hours. The reaction was
cooled to ambient temperature and filtered through a pad of Celite. The contents of the flask
were rinsed out with three 100 mL portions of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. The filtrate was
transferred into a 2L round bottom flask equipped with a thermocouple and mechanical stirrer
under nitrogen. Silica Gel (Silicylate SiliaMet@ Thiol) (0.4 g/g-pure-LR; 544 mmol; 32.7 g) was
charged and the flask was stirred at 40    0C overnight. The following morning, the reaction was
cooled to < 30   0C and filtered again through Celite. The pad was washed with 100mL of 2
methyltetrahydrofuran (or until no yellow color persisted in the filtrate). The filtrate was placed
into a 3L round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, distillation head (with condenser
and receiving flask), and thermocouple. The mixture was heated to 60        0C and placed under
vacuum (-450-500 mbar) to distil out 1.3 L total of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. 500 mL of toluene
was added to precipitate the desired product. The heating mantle was removed and the
reaction was allowed to reach ambient temperature. The mixture was stirred for 1 hour at
ambient temperature and then the solids were collected by vacuum filtration on a sintered glass
funnel. The cake was dried overnight on the funnel under vacuum. The following morning, the
solids were transferred into an amber bottle and weighed (71.9 g; 298 mmol). The product was
used in the next step without further purification.

[0412] In this case, direct compression can be used to manufacture the tablet and a standard
blend-mill-blend process can be used to prepare the blend. For example, first, all of the
ingredients except magnesium stearate would be added to a bin. The material wwould then be
mixed until well blended. The material would then be passed through a mill. The material
would then be mixed again until well blended. The magnesium stearate would then be added to
the mixture and mixed again. Finally, the resulting mixture would then be compressed into a
tablet.

[0419] The characterization data disclosed herein confirms the crystalline nature of the 6-[(4R)
4-methyl-1, 1-dioxido-1,2,6-thiadiazinan-2-yl]isoquinoline-1 -carbonitrile free base Form (1)
material and, as such, that it is a useful form for pharmaceutical development. For example,

                                                 158
crystalline materials are generally considered to be an advantageous form for drug substance
manufacturing because, for example, they are more easily purified, can be prepared with higher
yields, have improved filtration and drying characteristics and improved flow and handling
characteristics. Crystalline 6-[(4R)-4-methyl-1,1-dioxido-1,2,6-thiadiazinan-2-yl]isoquinoline-1
carbonitrile Form (1) also demonstrates physicochemical properties which render it useful for
drug product manufacturing such as its thermal stability and non-hygroscopic nature
demonstrated by the high DSC melting point and DSC profile.
Androgen Receptor-Mediated Transcriptional Assay Summary
[0420] CV-1 cells (American Tissue Culture Collection cat# CCL-70) were expanded in Growth
Media and transiently transfected in T225 cm2 flasks with a full length human Androgen
Receptor (AR) cDNA in the pcDNA3 expression vector and a human Androgen Response
Element (ARE)-luciferase cDNA in the pGL3 vector (both from Invitrogen). DNA (pg) and
Lipofectamine (pl) at a ratio of 1:3 were incubated with the cells in a total volume of 55 mL Basal
Media for 4 hours. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and frozen back (-1 50'C cryomed) at
a concentration of 4.3 million cells/mL.
[0421] On the day of the assay, frozen cells were thawed and re-suspended in Re-suspension
Media and plated at 40,000 cells/well (in 100 pL volume) in 96 well white plates and were
incubated for at least 4 h at 370C, 5% CO2. After incubation, cells were treated with the
compounds to be screened. 10mM stocks of the compounds were serially diluted 1:10 in 100%
DMSO followed by an additional 1:100 dilution in Assay Media. These dilution series were
added to the cell plates resulting in a further 1:10 dilution and a final % DMSO of 0.1%. The
vehicle control wells also contained this dilution of DMSO and the positive control wells
contained Dihydroxytestosterone (DHT) as an AR agonist at final concentration of 0.3 nM in
0.1% DMSO. Cells were incubated for 16 - 18 hours at 37'C and 5% CO2. Then the culture
media was removed from and the cells were lysed in 20 pL of cell lysis reagent for 5 minutes at
room temperature. 50 pL of luciferase reagent was added to each well and luminescence, over
5 seconds, was measured. The EC50 for each compound was calculated using the formulas
shown below.
Formulas
[0422] EC50 (half maximal effective concentration) was calculated from concentration series
plots which generated sigmoidal curves. Xlfit software was used to plot the best fit of the %
effect vs concentration and to calculate the EC5o. Using this protocol, the results set forth in the
Tables below were generated for the title compounds 1-39. The EC50 values obtained suggest
that the compounds of Formula 1, Formula 2 and Formula 3 as defined herein have activity in
modulating androgenic receptors, a key feature in many diseases affected by SARMs.
