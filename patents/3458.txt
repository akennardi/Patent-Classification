                        A LOCK CYLINDER ASSEMBLY
                           FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]      The invention relates to a lock cylinder (or key cylinder) assembly.
(In this specification, the terms lock cylinder and key cylinder (or lock cylinder
assembly and key cylinder assembly) are used interchangeably.) In particular,
the invention relates to, but is not limited to, a means and method for
attaching the cam of a lock cylinder assembly to the barrel thereof.
                     BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]      Reference to background art herein is not to be construed as an
admission that such art constitutes common general knowledge in Australia or
elsewhere.
[0003]      Lock cylinder (or key cylinder) assemblies are available in two
general varieties, namely single cylinder and double cylinder varieties. A key
cylinder assembly of the single cylinder variety typically has one barrel that
can rotate within the body or housing of the cylinder. One end of this single
barrel (the outer end) is often configured so that a key can be inserted into the
barrel, although in some cases the outer end of the barrel may have a
turnable handle, or the like, instead of an insertable key. The opposite end
(the inner end) of the single barrel is often configured for a component called
a cam to be secured thereto so that the cam then rotates with the barrel when
the barrel is turned (e.g. by turning the key etc). The cam is the component
that engages with, and which operates, internal components of the lock (i.e.
the lock in which the key cylinder assembly is mounted) when the key is
turned or when the handle or the like of the assembly is turned.
[0004]      In contrast, key cylinder assemblies of the double cylinder variety
are often configured, in effect, like two single cylinder key cylinder assemblies

                                       -2
joined together. Therefore, key cylinder assemblies of the double cylinder
variety typically incorporate two separate (i.e. separately turnable) barrels
arranged opposite one another along a common longitudinal axis. In use, in
most double cylinder key cylinder assemblies (i.e. when these are installed
and used in an associated lock), the outer end of one of the barrels is
accessible from one side of the door window (to allow a key to be inserted
from that side - e.g. the outside) while the outer end of the other barrel is
accessible from the opposite side of the door or window (to allow a key to be
inserted from that side - e.g. the inside). Like for single cylinder key cylinder
assemblies, in double cylinder key cylinder assemblies the outer end of one or
both barrels may alternatively have a turnable handle, or the like, instead of
an insertable key, although this is more common on the barrel that is
accessible from the inside - the barrel accessible from the outside typically
has an insertable key for security reasons. In many double cylinder key
cylinder assemblies, the inner end on each of the separate barrels is (again)
typically configured for a cam to be secured thereto so that the cams attached
to the respective barrels can rotate when the relevant barrel is turned.
[0005]      There are various methods that have previously been used to
attach a cam to a barrel in a lock cylinder assembly. One of the means by
which the cam has previously been attached to the barrel is by screwing the
cam to the barrel using screws which extend parallel to the longitudinal axis of
the barrel, so that the screws extend through holes in the cam and into the
end of the barrel - so that the screws screw the cam directly into the end of
the barrel. This method cannot be used on double cylinder key cylinder
assemblies. Another previously used method for attaching a cam to a barrel is
by using a barrel cap that screws onto threads formed on the outside of the
barrel at the inner end of the barrel - the cam is placed on the end of the
barrel and the barrel cap is then screwed on to hold the cam in place. Further,
in multi cam double cylinder key cylinder assemblies, and particularly ones
like those described above in which there are two separate barrels each with

                                        -3
a separate cam attached thereto, a circlip has previously been used to attach
each cam to its respective barrel.
[0006]      Using a circlip to attach a cam to a barrel, as just described, has a
problem in that there is potential for axial "play" or "slop" of the barrel relative
to the cylinder (i.e. there can be an undue or undesirable amount of
movement or potential movement of the barrel relative to the cylinder housing
in the axial direction). This can, in turn, lead to cylinder malfunction. In order
to avoid this cylinder malfunction, it has been necessary to impose tighter
manufacturing tolerances, but this can in turn increase the cost of such multi
cam double cylinder key cylinder assemblies and it can also make them more
susceptible to failure.
                         OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
[0007]      It is thought that it would be desirable if a lock cylinder assembly
could be provided which overcomes or ameliorates one or more of the
disadvantages or problems described above, or which at least provides a
useful alternative to existing designs.
                           SUMMARY OF INVENTION
[0008]      In one form, although not necessarily the only or broadest form, the
invention resides in a lock cylinder assembly comprising:
        a cylinder (or cylinder housing) with a bore therein;
        a barrel located in the bore of the cylinder, wherein the barrel has an
inner end and an outer end; and
        a cam attached to the inner end of the barrel,
        wherein a fastening member secures the cam to the inner end of the
barrel, and
        wherein the fastening member extends transversely relative to a
longitudinal axis of the barrel.

                                        -4
[0009]       The fastening member may be a pin. The fastening member may
be threaded or have one or more threaded portions. The fastening member
may be a screw.
[0010]       The barrel may have a first protrusion at the inner end. The first
protrusion may comprise a bore therein that extends transversely relative to
the longitudinal axis of the barrel. The bore of the first protrusion may be
internally threaded.
[0011]       The barrel may have a second protrusion at the inner end. The
second protrusion may comprise a bore therein that extends transversely
relative to the longitudinal axis of the barrel. The bore of the second protrusion
may be internally threaded.
[0012]       The first and second protrusions may be substantially semi-circular
in shape. The first and second protrusions may be spaced apart from each
other. A gap may be formed between the first and second protrusions.
[0013]       The outer end of the barrel may be configured for a key to be
inserted therein. The outer end of the barrel may be configured as, or to
connect to, a knob.
[0014]       The barrel may be secured to the cylinder by a circlip. The circlip
may be located between a central portion of the barrel and a ridge at the inner
end of the barrel.
[0015]       The cam may have a radially inward protrusion. The cam may have
a radially outward cam member. The first cam may have a depression. The
radially inward protrusion may have a recessed portion. The recessed portion
may be aligned with the depression.
[0016]       The cam may be located over the first and second protrusions. The
radially inward protrusion of the cam may be located in the gap between the
first and second protrusions.
[0017]       The fastening member may be located in the bores of the first and
second protrusions of the inner end of the first barrel.

                                        -5
[0018]      The fastening member may engage the cam. The outer surface of
the fastening member may be in contact with the recessed portion of the
radially inward protrusion of the cam.
[0019]      The lock cylinder assembly may further comprise:
        a second cylinder with a bore therein;
        a second barrel located in the bore of the second cylinder, wherein the
second barrel has an inner end and an outer end; and
        a second cam attached to the inner end of the second barrel.
[0020]      A second fastening member may secure the second cam to the
inner end of the second barrel. The second fastening member may extend
transversely relative to a longitudinal axis of the second barrel.
[0021]      In another form the invention resides in a method of attaching a
cam to a barrel of a lock cylinder assembly, the method including the steps of:
        locating the cam at an inner end of the barrel; and
        securing the cam to the barrel with a fastening member,
        wherein the fastening member extends transversely with respect to a
        longitudinal axis of the barrel.
[0022]      The step of locating the cam at the inner end of the barrel may
include locating the cam on a first protrusion and a second protrusion at the
inner end of the barrel. The step of locating the cam at the inner end of the
barrel may include locating a radially inward protrusion of the cam in a gap
between the first and second protrusions of the barrel.
[0023]      The step of securing the cam to the barrel with the fastening
member may include inserting the fastening member into a bore of the first
protrusion and a bore of the second protrusion.
[0024]      In another form the invention resides in a lock cylinder assembly
comprising:
        a cylinder with a bore therein;

                                      -6
        a barrel located in the bore of the cylinder, wherein the barrel has an
inner end and an outer end; and
        a cam attached to the inner end of the barrel,
        wherein a circlip secures the barrel in the bore of the cylinder, the
barrel has a ridge at the outer end that engages with the cylinder, and the
circlip and ridge together substantially prevent axial play of the barrel in the
cylinder.
[0025]      Further features and advantages of the present invention will
become apparent from the following detailed description.

                DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0027]        Figures 1a-3b illustrate a lock cylinder assembly 10 according to an
embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the lock cylinder assembly
10 is a multi cam double cylinder key cylinder assembly. The lock cylinder
assembly 10 therefore includes a first cylinder 100 and a second cylinder 200.
However, in other embodiments, the lock cylinder assembly could be, say, a
single cylinder key cylinder assembly.
[0028]       The lock cylinder assembly 10 is formed from a metal, as is
conventional. Any material conventionally used for the manufacture of key
cylinders (or parts thereof) may be used, and the materials used are not
critical to the invention.
[0029]       The first cylinder 100 of the lock cylinder assembly 10 (or the
housing of the first cylinder 100) comprises a central bore 101 through which
a first barrel 110 extends. The first barrel 110 has a longitudinal axis 111, an
inner end 112, an outer end 113 and a central portion. When the first barrel
110 is located in the bore 101 of the first cylinder 100, the inner end 112 of
the first barrel 110 projects beyond the inner end of the bore 101. The outer
end 113 of the first barrel 110 is configured to receive a key inserted by a
user. However, as mentioned above, in other embodiments, the outer end 113
of the first barrel 110 could be provided with a turnable knob or a handle.
[0030]        Referring briefly to Figure 3b, it will be seen that, in this
embodiment, both the first cylinder 100 and the second cylinder 200
incorporate a conventional split pin mechanism. Such split pin mechanisms
are widely used in key cylinder assemblies and ensure that a key barrel can
only be turned in its cylinder when the correct key is inserted thereby causing
the "splits" in all of the pins to align with the interface between the barrel and
the surrounding cylinder. However, as mentioned elsewhere, embodiments of
the present invention could also operate with the barrel of one or both of the
cylinders (or with the barrel of the single cylinder in a single cylinder key
cylinder assembly) being provided with a handle rather than an insertable key.

                                          -8
In embodiments where a simple handle is provided for turning the barrel
relative to the cylinder, a split pin arrangement like that shown in Figure 3b will
not be provided, and the barrel may be a simple barrel that is able to turn
within the cylinder whenever the handle is grasped and turned by a user.
[0031]       Returning now to the embodiment shown in the Figures, it will be
seen that the inner end 112 of the first barrel 110 includes a first protrusion
114 and a second protrusion 115 both of which project forwards (inwards)
from the inner end of the barrel in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis
111 of the first barrel 110. There is also a ridge 119 on the curved outside
surface of each of the first and second protrusions extending generally
circumferentially. The first and second protrusions 114, 115 are identical
mirror images of one another (or almost so), and as shown in the Figures,
they are generally semi-circular in shape. However, in other embodiments, the
first and second protrusions 114, 115 may have a different shape or may
differ in shape from each other. Both of the first and second protrusions 114,
115 comprise a bore 116, 117 therein. The bore 116 in the first protrusion
114 extends all the way through the first protrusion 114 in a direction that is
transverse to the longitudinal axis 111 of the first barrel 110. The bore 117 in
the second protrusion 115 may also extend all the way through the second
protrusion 115, however in this embodiment the bore 117 is actually a blind
bore which opens through the flat inner side of the second protrusion 115 and
which extends part way through (but not all of the way through) the second
protrusion 115. The bores 116, 117 in this embodiment are both circular in
shape and axially aligned. However, in other embodiments, the bores 116,
117 may have a different shape (e.g. they could have a polygonal or other
non-circular cross sectional shape adapted to receive a correspondingly
polygonal or non-circular pin therein). Further, in this embodiment, the bore
117 of the second protrusion 115 is internally threaded. However, in this
embodiment, the bore 116 in the first protrusion 114 is not threaded - this
means that the fastening member 150 (see below) can be inserted more

                                          -9
easily as it can pass through the bore 116 without needing to be screwed
therethrough, and it only needs to be screwed into the bore 117. In other
embodiments, it may be that both or neither of the bores 116, 117 are
internally threaded.
[0032]       The first and second protrusions 114, 115 are spaced apart from
each other in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 111 resulting in
a gap 118 being formed between the first and second protrusions 114, 115 at
the inner end 112 of the first barrel 110.
[0033]       A first cam 120 is attached to the inner end 112 of the first barrel
110. The first cam 120 is substantially ring-shaped and includes a depression
121, a radially inward protrusion 122 and a radially outward cam member 123.
The radially inward protrusion 122 also includes a recessed portion that is
recessed by roughly the same amount as the depression 121 of the first cam
120.
[0034]       A first circlip 130 is provided, and after the first barrel 110 has been
inserted all the way into the bore 101, the circlip 130 is clipped onto the
projecting end of the barrel 110. More specifically, the circlip 130 is received
on the end of the barrel 110 in between the outward-facing edges of the ridge
119 (on the first and second protrusions) and the inward-facing edge of the
larger diameter portion of the barrel's central portion. The circlip 130, once
installed, prevents the first barrel 110 from sliding back outward relative to the
first cylinder 100. The outer end of the barrel 110 is also enlarged relative to
the barrel's main central portion and comprises a ridge which engages with a
ridge in the outer open end of the bore 101; this prevents the barrel 110 from
sliding further inward relative to the first cylinder 100 than it should. Thus, the
circlip 130 and these ridges prevent axial 'play' and 'slop' of the first barrel 100
in the bore 101 of the first cylinder 100.
[0035]       To secure the first cam 120 to the inner end 112 of the first barrel
110, the circlip 130 is first secured to the inner end 112 of the first barrel 110,
as just described. The first cam 120 is then slid axially onto the inner end 112

                                       -10
of the barrel 110, over the first and second protrusions 114, 115, such that the
radially-inward facing surface on the inside of the first cam 120 is in contact
with the curved outer surfaces of the first and second protrusions 114, 115
and the radially inward protrusion 122 of the first cam 120 is located snugly
within the gap 118 with the depression 121 of the first cam 120 and the
recessed portion of the radially inward protrusion 122 of the first cam 120
aligned with the bores 116, 117 of the first and second protrusions 114, 115.
[0036]       A first fastening member 150 (not shown in Figs. 1a and 1b) is then
inserted through the bores 116, 117 of the first and second protrusions 114,
115. In this embodiment, the fastening member is a threaded pin or a grub
screw. However, as has been mentioned, in other embodiments, the fastening
member may be another form of screw, or it may have a different shape
and/or it may not be threaded (e.g it may be more in the nature of a simple
pin). The first fastening member 150, in this particular embodiment, is inserted
through the bore 116 of the first protrusion 114 and then screwed into the
internally threaded bore 117 of the second protrusion 115 at the inner end
112 of the first barrel 110. The outer surface of the first fastening member 150
also comes into contact with the recessed portion of the radially inward
protrusion 122 of the first cam 120, and this thereby prevents movement of
the first cam 120 relative to the barrel 110, including movement or "play" of
the cam 120 relative to the barrel 110 along or perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis 111 of the barrel 110. Further, rotational movement of the
first cam 120 relative to the barrel 110 about the longitudinal axis 111 is also
prevented by the radially inward protrusion 122 being located in the gap 118.
Of course, the cam 120 is fixedly attached to the barrel 110 and therefore
when the barrel 110 is turned the cam 120 also turns simultaneously by the
same amount (and the cam member 123 thereof engages with internal
components inside the lock in which the key cylinder is installed to thereby
operate the lock). In a different or alternative embodiment or arrangement
(i.e. different to that shown in the drawings), the configuration could allow for

                                        - 11
some free rotational movement or play between the cam and the barrel (i.e. a
so-called "lazy cam"). This might be achieved, for example, by altering the
configurations (shapes) of the gap 118, protrusion 122, depression 121, etc,
although it could also be achieved in a range of other ways.
[0037]       The second cylinder 200 of the lock cylinder assembly 10 is an
identical mirror image of the first cylinder 100 and comprises a second barrel
210, a second circlip 230, a second cam 220 and a second fastening member
250 (shown in Fig. 3b). The configuration and operation of this will not be
discussed as this will be readily appreciated from the discussion above. In the
drawings, parts and elements of (or associated with) the second cylinder 200
are given the same reference number as the corresponding part or element in
the first cylinder 100, except that the prefix "1"is replaced with the prefix "2".
So, for example, the first and second protrusions 114 and 115 of the first
cylinder 100 have equivalent first and second protrusions 214 and 215 on the
second cylinder 200, etc.
[0038]       The first and second fastening members 150, 250 may allow for a
simple, yet effective, mechanism to secure the first and second cams 120,
220 to their respective barrels 110, 210. The first and second fastening
members 150, 250 may also prevent any undesirable movement of the first
and second cams 120, 220 with respect to the first and second barrels 110,
210. The design of the lock cylinder assembly 10 may also allow the cams
120, 220 to be held securely in position with respect to the barrels 110, 210
even if the first and/or second fastening members 150, 250 loosen slightly
over time with use, as the mere presence of the first and second fastening
members 150, 250 holds the first and second cams 120, 220 in the desired
position.
[0039]       In this specification, adjectives such as first and second, inner and
outer, top and bottom, proximal and distal, and the like may be used solely to
distinguish one element or action from another element or action without
necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order. Where

                                         -12
the context permits, reference to an integer or a component or step (or the
like) is not to be interpreted as being limited to only one of that integer,
component, or step, but rather could be one or more of that integer,
component, or step etc.
