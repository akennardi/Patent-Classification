inhibitors and other therapeutic agents. Such combinations are useful in the inhibition of
HIV replication, the prevention and/or treatment of infection by HIV, and in the treatment of
AIDS and/or ARC.

                                         ANTIVIRAL THERAPY
            This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application <removed-apn>, which
   in turn is a divisional of Australian Patent Application 2014202404, which in turn is a
 5 divisional of Australian Patent No. 2011209788, the entire contents of which are to be
   taken as incorporated herein by this reference.
                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            The human immunodeficiency virus ("HIV") is the causative agent for acquired
10 immunodeficiency syndrome ("AIDS"), a disease characterized by the destruction of the
   immune system, particularly of CD4* T-cells, with attendant susceptibility to opportunistic
   infections, and its precursor AIDS-related complex ("ARC"), a syndrome characterized by
   symptoms such as persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, fever and weight loss. HIV
   is a retrovirus; the conversion of its RNA to DNA is accomplished through the action of the
15 enzyme reverse transcriptase. Compounds that inhibit the function of reverse
   transcriptase inhibit replication of HIV in infected cells. Such compounds are useful in the
   prevention or treatment of HIV infection in humans.
            In addition to CD4, HIV requires a co-receptor for entry into target cells. The
   chemokine receptors function together with CD4 as co-receptors for HIV. The chemokine
20 receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 have been identified as the main co-receptors for HIV-1.
   CCR5 acts as a major co-receptor for fusion and entry of macrophage-tropic HIV into host
   cells. These chemokine receptors are thought to play an essential role in the
   establishment and dissemination of an HIV infection. Therefore, CCR5 antagonists are
   thought to be useful as therapeutic agents active against HIV.
25          As in the case of several other retroviruses, HIV encodes the production of a
   protease which carries out post-translational cleavage of precursor polypeptides in a
   process necessary for the formation of infectious virions. These gene products include
   pol, which encodes the virion RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase),
   an endonuclease, HIV protease, and gag, which encodes the core-proteins of the virion.
30          One focus of anti-viral drug design has been to create compounds which inhibit the
   formation of infectious virions by interfering with the processing of viral polyprotein
   precursors. Processing of these precursor proteins requires the action of virus-encoded
   proteases which are essential for replication. The anti-viral potential of HIV protease
   inhibition has been demonstrated using peptidyl inhibitors.
35          A required step in HIV replication in human T-cells is the insertion by virally
   encoded integrase of proviral DNA into the host cell genome. Integration is believed to be
   mediated by integrase in a process involving assembly of a stable nucleoprotein complex
                                                    1

   with viral DNA sequences, cleavage of two nucleotides from the 3' termini of the linear
   proviral DNA and covalent joining of the recessed 3' OH termini of the proviral DNA at a
   staggered cut made at the host target site. The repair synthesis of the resultant gap may
   be accomplished by cellular enzymes. Inhibitors of HIV integrase can be effective in
 5 treating AIDS and inhibiting viral replication.
             Administration of combinations of therapeutic compounds in the treatment of HIV
   infection and related conditions can result in potentiated antiviral activity, reduced toxicity,
   delayed progression to resistance, and increased drug efficacy. Combinations
   administered in a single dosage unit can result in increased patient compliance as the pill
10 burden is reduced and dosing schedules are simplified. However, not all compounds are
   suitable for administration in combinations. Factors that influence the feasibility of
   combinations include the chemical instability of the compounds, size of the dosage unit,
   potential for antagonistic or merely additive activities of the combined compounds, and
   difficulties in achieving a suitable formulation.
15           There is continued need to find therapeutic agents suitable for use in combination
   and feasible pharmaceutical compositions to treat HIV infection. Due to their high potency
   and pharmacokinetic profile, certain HIV integrase inhibitors are attractive as components
   in combination therapy.

   invention. It is not suggested or represented that any or all of these matters formed part
   of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the

20 Assays
   Method
            Antiviral HIV activity was measured by means of a tetrazolium-based colorimetric
   procedure in the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) transformed cell line MT-4.
   Aliquots of test compound were diluted vertically across a deep-well master assay plate,
25 in medium (RPMI 1640, 10% vol./vol. fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 10 .g/mL
   gentamicin), at concentrations that were approximately 40-fold higher than the final assay
   concentration. Serial dilutions were made at either 1:2 or 1:3.16 ratios. HIV inhibitors
   were diluted horizontally across master assay plates, also in concentrations that were
   approximately 40-fold higher than the final assay concentration. Small aliquots of both the
30 vertically-diluted and the horizontally-diluted compounds were combined in daughter
   plates using an automated 96-well pipetting system (RapidPlate-96, Zymark Corp.).
   Checkerboard style dilutions were arranged so that every concentration of test compound
   was tested in the presence and absence of every concentration of the HIV inhibitors. Anti
   HIV activity tests were performed in triplicate assays, or more, of each combination.
35 Exponentially growing MT-4 cells were harvested and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10
   minutes in a Jouan centrifuge (Model CR 4 12). Cell pellets were re-suspended in fresh
   medium (RPMI 1640, 20% vol./vol. FBS, 20% vol./vol. IL-2, and 10 tg/mL gentamicin) to a

   density of 1.25 x 106 cells/mL. Cell aliquots were infected by the addition of HIV-1 (strain
   IllB) diluted to give a viral multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 73 pfU per 1 x 104 cells. A
   similar cell aliquot was diluted with medium to provide a mock-infected control. Cell
   infection was allowed to proceed for 1 hour at 370C in a tissue culture incubator with
 5 humidified 5% C02 atmosphere. After the 1 hour incubation the virus/cell suspension was
   added to each well of the plates containing pre-diluted compounds. Plates were then
   placed in a tissue culture incubator with humidified 5% C02 for 5 days. At the end of the
   incubation period, 40 tL of CellTiter 96 MTS reagent (Promega no. G3581) was added to
   each well of the incubation plate. Plates were incubated at 370C for 2 to 3 hours to allow
10 for color development. O.D. was measured at 492 nM using a microplate absorbance
   reader (Tecan no. 20-300).
   Virus used
   HIV-1 strain IllB, wild-type laboratory strain, virus titer = 6.896 E4 TCID 5 0/mL.
   Data Analysis
15          Although some assay formats might theoretically miss antagonism due to
   combination cytotoxicity, the approach described here should not miss an antagonistic
   effect. The readout in the MT-4 cell assay utilizes MTS, a tetrazolium-based staining
   reagent where changes in optical density (O.D.) of the reagent are used to estimate the
   total cell number remaining after treatment. Final MT-4 cell numbers may decrease due
20 to two effects. First, an HIV-induced cytotoxicity may occur when HIV kills greater than
   75% of the MT-4 cells during the 5 days following infection. Second, a compound-induced
   cytotoxicity may occur, where the compound either directly kills the MT-4 cells or prevents
   cell growth (stasis) over the 5 days in either infected or uninfected cells. In either of these
   situations the O.D. is low as compared with infected cells protected by anti-HIV-1
25 compounds or relative to untreated and uninfected control cells. Since both cytotoxic
   effects and antagonism of anti-HIV activity would lead to lower O.D. we should not miss
   an antagonistic effect due to combination cytotoxicity, but could underestimate synergistic
   combinations.
            Within assay combination cytotoxicity was evaluated by comparing wells
30 containing the uninfected MT-4 cells from the assay plates that contained the highest
   concentration of test compound or the comparator compound, with wells containing HIV-1
   infected MT-4 cells under the corresponding highest combination concentrations. For
   each of these values there is one well per assay plate and thus at least 3 wells per
   combination assay. Although they do not comprise a formal combination cytotoxicity
35 analysis, the ratio of compound in combinations to compound alone provides a measure
   of the compound combination cytotoxicity within the concentrations examined.

          The interaction of each pair of compound combinations was analyzed by the
   methods described by Selleseth, D.W. et al. (2003) Antimicrobial Agents and
   Chemotherapy 47:1468-71. Synergy and antagonism are defined as deviations from
   dosewise additivity, which results when two drugs interact as if they were the same drug.
 5 Values for average deviation from additivity in the range of - 0.1 to - 0.2 indicate weak
   synergy and values that approach - 0.5 would indicate strong synergy of the interaction.
   Conversely, positive values of 0.1 to 0.2 would indicate that a weak antagonism exists
   between the treatments.
