                                      Title of the Invention
                                Modified Food/Drink packaging
                                      Field of the Invention
    The present invention relates to a modified disposable or reusable food/drink
  5 packaging comprising an indented portion for storing confectionery, pharmaceuticals,
    vitamins and the like.
                                 Background of the Invention
    Food and drink items sold to customers at cafes, takeaway outlets, supermarkets,
    petrol stations and the like are typically provided and served in standard disposable
 .0 or reusable articles such as containers, cups and packets of various sizes with lids
    and seals that are formed to cover the article while providing some access to the
    food/drink for consumption. In many cases, the customers or consumers would
    benefit from having an additional storage pocket attached to the container, cup or
    packaging which could house any type of food, confectionary, pharmaceutical or
 .5 vitamin, so it can be taken after they consume the food/drink item. Many, if not all, of
    these items need to be purchased separately and are often an afterthought once the
    food/drink is consumed, then the consumer is required to go out of their way to
    purchase these items often purchasing more than actually is required. This then
    results in additional waste and unused product going to landfill. With environmental
20  impact being ever more important, the idea of incorporating these onetime
    consumables into the existing food/drink packaging is the best way to avoid this
    extra waste.
                                                  1

    There have been various types and forms of disposable and reusable food/drink
    containers, cups and packaging that have been devised and developed with
    additional functional capabilities beyond that of food and liquid containment. Several
    of these multi-functional food/drink packagings found in the prior art have been
  5 designed having one or more receptacles, cavities or other receiving chambers
    formed within their structure in addition to the primary food or liquid-holding chamber
    to receive, carry and/or store one or more items of a personal nature often found in
    the possession of the consumer, such as a cigarette lighter, a comb or a cellular
    phone. While these and other prior art devices and designs for multi-functional food
 .o or beverage containers have been satisfactory in storing various personal items in
    their separate chambers, none have been found particularly effective in both
    receiving and carrying both with ease and convenience.
    It would therefore be desirable for consumers and venders as well to have food/drink
    packaging sold and served for consumption having one or more compartments
 .s formed together therewith so that any items or articles desired by the consumer can
    be easily retained and stored within the container without disturbing the food/drink
    contents and the normal consumption thereof.
    Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a container, cup or
    packet which overcomes the problems in the art.
20
                                   Summary of the Invention
    The present invention provides an article for storing items comprising a cavity or
    indented portion to store an item such as a piece(s) of confectionery, pharmaceutical
                                                 2

    or vitamin item; and a sticker or resealable flip up tab which exposes the stored item
    upon removable of the sticker or resealable flip up tab.
    In another aspect, the present invention provides an article for storing items
    comprising a coffee cup (1), a cup lid (2), optionally a main recess portion in the lid
  5 such as a cavity or indented portion (4) to store confectionary (5), pharmaceutical or
    vitamin item and a sticker or resealable flip up tab (6) which exposes the stored item
    upon removable of the sticker or resealable flip up tab.
    Preferably, the stored item includes confectionary, pharmaceuticals, vitamins and the
    like.
 .0 Preferably, the article is a container such as a coffee cup, burger box, chip packet,
    food container or a pizza box, but not limited to these.
    Preferably, the cavity or indented portion is located at the top section of the cup,
    container or packet somewhere that is visually pleasing and easily accessible eg. On
    the lid or close to the opening seal of the food/drink packaging.

                          Detailed Description of the invention
    The present invention relates to an article, such as a food or beverage container,
    adapted to store a piece(s) of confectionery, pharmaceuticals or
    vitamins manufactured into the food/drink packaging or container. The food/drink
 .o packaging may include but is not limited to disposable or reusable takeaway food
    containers, pizza boxes, burger boxes, coffee cup lids, potato chip packets, etc. The
    packaging includes all types of food/drink packaging sold at restaurants, cafes, fast
    food restaurants, takeaway restaurants supermarkets, shops etc. The food/drink
    packaging may have the piece(s) of confectionery, pharmaceuticals or
 .s vitamins installed anywhere on the packaging. The packaging comprises a storage
    portion such as a pocket(s) with a sticker or resalable flip up tab that will expose the
    piece(s) of confectionery etc. The purpose for the storage portion is to enable
    consumption of the piece(s) of confectionery, pharmaceuticals or vitamins after the
    consumer has finished their food/drink item.
20  Figure 1 shows a modified disposable or reusable coffee cup (1) as an embodiment
    of the present invention. The coffee cup (1) comprises a cup lid (2), a main recess
    portion in the lid such as a cavity or indented portion (4) to store a confectionery item
    such as a mint or piece of gum (5) and a sticker or resealable flip up tab (6) which
                                                 4

    exposes the stored item upon removable of the sticker or resealable flip up tab (6).
    The sticker (6) may represent a tear off or peel up tag. The spout of the coffee cup is
    preferably at an end opposite to the cavity or indented portion (5).
    The present invention may be used to store items in other disposable or reusable
  5 containers including burger boxes, potato chip packets, pizza boxes, food containers
    and the like as shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4.
    Figure 2 shows a modified disposable burger box (7) as an embodiment of the
    present invention. The cavity in the box (7) is placed on the top portion of the box in
    this embodiment.
 .o Figure 3 shows a modified disposable chip packet (8) as an embodiment of the
    present invention. The cavity in the packet (8) is placed on the top portion of the box
    in this embodiment.
    Figure 4 shows a modified disposable pizza box (9) as an embodiment of the
    present invention. The cavity in the box (10) is placed on the top portion of the box in
 .5 this embodiment.
    Figure 5 shows a modified disposable or reusable food container (11) as an
    embodiment of the present invention.
    Optionally, the modified coffee cup (1) comprises a spill recess portion (3).
    Furthermore, optionally, the coffee cup (1) comprises of a second layer just around
20  the indented portion where the confectionary, pharmaceutical or vitamin is stored.
    The second layer is designed to accommodate an air cavity around the indented
    portion below the coffee cup lid. This extra layer helps with stacking the lids, so
                                                5

    there is no extra pressure placed onto the sticker which could cause them to mark or
    peel off. The second layer is preferably about 1 to 3 mm larger than the indented
    section where the confectionary etc is stored to allow an air cavity, thereby providing
    an insulation effect to any heat generated by the hot beverage. Preferably, the
  5 second layer is glued to the underside of the coffee cup lid.
    Having the removable sticker or resealable flip up tab on top of the article such as a
    food container or a coffee cup according to the present invention has advantages of
    easy access and more aesthetic appearance.
    While considerable emphasis has been placed herein on the specific features of the
 .0 preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated that many additional features can be
    added and that many changes can be made in the preferred embodiment without
    departing from the principles of the disclosure. These and other changes in the
    preferred embodiment of the disclosure will be apparent to those skilled in the art
    from the disclosure herein, whereby it is to be distinctly understood that the foregoing
 .s descriptive matter is to be interpreted merely as illustrative of the disclosure and not
    as a limitation.
