                                          1
                                       TITLE
                                      HINGES
                            FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]      The invention relates to hinges. In particular, the invention relates
to, but is not limited, to a dampening hinge to dampen the closing of a door,
gate, screen, barrier or the like attached to the hinge. It is envisaged that the
invention is particularly well suited for use with glass doors, but it should be
appreciated that the hinge can similarly be used for doors, gates, screens,
barriers or the like constructed from other materials. Embodiments of the
present invention are also directed to hinged arrangements comprising one or
more of the dampening hinges.
                        BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]      Hinges are used in a wide range of applications to enable an
element, such as a door or gate or the like, to swing between an open and
closed position relative to another element, such as a wall, door frame, fence
or barrier or the like.
[0003]      Some hinges include one or more biasing elements or components,
to bias the hinge toward a closed position once the hinge has been opened.
Such hinges are often employed with doors or gates for pool fences for safety
reasons and for shower screens or doors to ensure the screen or door has
closed to prevent the egress of water. Examples of biasing elements or
components include springs, such as torsion springs and magnets.
[0004]      To mitigate vibrations and/or damage to doors and/or gates with
such biasing elements or components, hinges have been developed with one
or more dampening elements that slow closure of the hinge. Such hinges are
often used with glass doors, screens and gates.
[0005]      However, there are a number of drawbacks with such hinges. For
example, mechanical wear can result in the biasing components providing
3295156vl

insufficient force to bias the hinge to the closed position. In some hinges,
incorporation of both the biasing components and the dampening elements
can result in bulky and heavy hinges, which increases manufacturing costs,
can result in limitations on the materials with which such hinges can be used.
Such hinges can also have a complex construction, which contributes to the
manufacturing costs and can increase the likelihood of failure.
[0006]         Reference to background art herein is not to be construed as an
admission that such art constitutes common general knowledge.
                             OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
[0007]         It is a preferred object of this invention to provide a hinge which
overcomes or at least ameliorates one or more of the disadvantages or
problems described above, or which at least provides a useful commercial
alternative.
[0008]         Other preferred objects of the present invention will become
apparent from the following description.
                            SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0009]         In one form, although not necessarily the only or the broadest form,
the invention resides in a hinge comprising:
          a first leaf having a first front leaf plate, a first rear leaf plate and a first
intermediate leaf member connected between the first front leaf plate and the
first rear leaf plate;
          a second leaf hingedly coupled to the first leaf, the second leaf having
a second front leaf plate, a second rear leaf plate and a second intermediate
leaf member connected between the second front leaf plate and the second
rear leaf plate; and
          at least one dampener having a body received within the first or second
intermediate leaf member and a shock absorbing member slidably received
within the body of the at least one dampener to dampen hinged movement of
3295156vl

                                           3
the first leaf and the second leaf from an open position of the hinge toward a
closed position of the hinge.
[0010]      Preferably, a neutral position of the shock absorbing member within
the body of the at least one dampener is adjustable to adjust a position at
which damping commences.
[0011]      Preferably, the body of the at least one dampener comprises an
external thread.
[0012]      Preferably, the first or second intermediate leaf member comprises
a recess having an internal thread for receiving the threaded body of the at
least one dampener so that the neutral position of the body and thus the
shock absorbing member can be adjusted.
[0013]      Preferably, the at least one dampener comprises a dampening
fluid, such as oil or air, within the body.
[0014]      Preferably, the second leaf is hingedly coupled to the first leaf by a
knuckle and pin assembly. More preferably, the second rear leaf plate is
coupled to the first rear leaf plate by a knuckle and pin assembly.
[0015]      Preferably, the first front leaf plate, the first rear leaf plate and the
first intermediate leaf member each include at least one aperture for receiving
a fastener to fasten the hinge to a surface, such as a door frame or a gate
frame, wherein each of the apertures are aligned.
[0016]      Preferably, the second front leaf plate, the second rear leaf plate
and the second intermediate leaf member each include at least one aperture
for receiving a fastener to fasten the hinge to a door or a gate, wherein each
of the apertures are aligned.
[0017]      Preferably,     the   second    or  first intermediate     leaf   member
respectively has a recessed portion aligned with the shock absorbing member
of the dampener.
[0018]      Suitably, the hinge comprises two dampeners. Optionally, two
dampeners are provided within the first intermediate leaf member or within the
second intermediate leaf member. Alternatively, one dampener is provided
within the first intermediate leaf member and one dampener is provided within

                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[0037]      Elements of the invention are illustrated in concise outline form in
the drawings, showing only those specific details that are necessary to
understanding the embodiments of the present invention, but so as not to
clutter the disclosure with excessive detail that will be clear to those of
ordinary skill in the art in light of the present description.
[0038]      FIG. 1 illustrates a hinge 100 according to an embodiment of the
present invention. Hinge 100 comprises a first leaf 102 having a first front leaf
plate 104, a first rear leaf plate 106 and a first intermediate leaf member 108
connected between the first front leaf plate 104 and the first rear leaf plate
106. Hinge 100 comprises a second leaf 110 hingedly coupled to the first leaf
102. The second leaf 110 has a second front leaf plate 112, a second rear
leaf plate 114 and a second intermediate leaf member 116 connected
between the second front leaf plate 112 and the second rear leaf plate 114.
[0039]      Hinge 100 comprises at least one dampener 118 to dampen hinged
movement of the first leaf 102 and the second leaf 110 from an open position
3295156vl

                                        6
of the hinge toward a closed position of the hinge. In the embodiment shown
in FIG 1, the hinge 100 comprises two dampeners 118 spaced apart from
each other.
[0040]     With additional reference to the enlarged view in FIG 2, the at least
one dampener 118 has a body 120 received within the first intermediate leaf
member 108. In alternative embodiments, the body 120 of the at least one
dampener 118 is received within the second intermediate leaf member 116.
The at least one dampener 118 has a shock absorbing member 122 slidably
received within the body 120 of the at least one dampener to dampen hinged
movement of the first leaf 102 and the second leaf 110 from an open position
of the hinge 100 toward a closed position of the hinge.
[0041]     In preferred embodiments of the hinge 100, a neutral position of the
shock absorbing member 122 within the body 120 of the at least one
dampener is adjustable to adjust a position at which damping by the at least
one dampener 118 commences. The neutral position can be considered to be
the distance the shock absorbing member 122 extends from the body 120
when the hinge 100 is in the open position or partially open position and the
opposing intermediate leaf member is not impinging upon the shock absorbing
member 122 and thus not forcing the shock absorbing member 122 within the
body 120.
[0042]     With   particular  reference   to  FIGS   7  and   8,  in  preferred
embodiments of the hinge 100, the body 120 of the at least one dampener
118 comprises an external thread 124. The first intermediate leaf member 108
and/or the second intermediate leaf member 116 comprises a recess or
channel 126 having an internal thread 128 for receiving the threaded body
120 of the at least one dampener 118. The at least one dampener 118 can
therefore be screwed into the channel 126 to the desired depth. Hence, the
neutral position of the body 120 of the dampener, and thus the neutral
position of the shock absorbing member 122, i.e. the position at which
damping commences, can be adjusted.
[0043]     In preferred embodiments of the hinge 100, the at least one
dampener 118 comprises a dampening fluid, such as oil or air, within the body
120.
3295156vl

                                         7
[0044]      As shown in the drawings, in preferred embodiments of the hinge
100, the second leaf 110 is hingedly coupled to the first leaf 102 by a knuckle
and pin assembly 129. More particularly, the second rear leaf plate 114 is
coupled to the first rear leaf plate 106 by the knuckle and pin assembly 129.
[0045]      With reference to FIGS 1, 3 and 7 in particular, in preferred
embodiments of the hinge 100, the first front leaf plate 104, the first rear leaf
plate 106 and the first intermediate leaf member 108 each include at least one
aperture 130 for receiving a fastener, such as a screw, to fasten the hinge 100
to a surface, such as a door frame or a gate frame or a fence, wherein each of
the apertures 130 are aligned. Similarly, the second front leaf plate 112, the
second rear leaf plate 114 and the second intermediate leaf member 116
each include at least one aperture 132 for receiving a fastener, such as a
screw, to fasten the hinge 100 to a door or a gate or screen or the like,
wherein each of the apertures 132 are aligned.
[0046]      With reference to FIG 1, the second intermediate leaf member 116
or the first intermediate leaf member 108 respectively has a recessed portion
or recess 134 that is aligned with the shock absorbing member 122 of the
dampener 118 when the hinge 100 is in the closed position such that a head
136 of the shock absorbing member 122 is partially received within the recess
134. A recess 134 can be provided to partially receive the head 136 of a
corresponding dampener 118.
[0047]      As shown in FIGS 1, 3 and 7, in some embodiments the hinge 100
comprises two dampeners 118. In some embodiments of the hinge 100, two
dampeners 118 are provided within the first intermediate leaf member 108.
Consequently, two recesses 134 are provided within the second intermediate
leaf member 116. Alternatively, two dampeners 118 are provided within the
second intermediate leaf member 116. Consequently, two recesses 134 are
provided within the first intermediate leaf member 108. In other embodiments,
one dampener 118 is provided within the first intermediate leaf member 108
and one dampener 118 is provided within the second intermediate leaf
member 116. Consequently, one recess 134 is provided within the second
intermediate leaf member 116 and one recess 134 is provided within the first
intermediate leaf member 108.
3295156vl

                                          8
[0048]       It is envisaged that in some embodiments, more than two
dampeners 118 are provided in the first and/or second intermediate leaf
members 108, 116 if required by the particular application, for example, with a
particularly large and/or heavy door, gate, screen or the like.
[0049]       The hinge 100 according to the present invention is used in
conjunction with a conventional second hinge comprising at least one biasing
element, such as, but not limited to a torsion spring, to bias the door or gate or
screen or the like from an open position towards a closed position. An
example of a suitable conventional hinge 200 is shown in FIGS 9-13. Hence,
the conventional hinge 200 provides the biasing force to close the door or
gate or screen or the like and the hinge 100 according to the present invention
dampens the closing of the door or gate or screen or the like to avoid vibration
and/or damage to the door or gate or screen or the like. The conventional
hinge 200 can be attached at or towards the bottom of the door or gate or
screen or barrier or the like and the hinge 100 according to the present
invention can be attached at or towards the top of the door or gate or screen
or barrier or the like or vice versa.
[0050]      As shown in FIG 13, an end cap 202 is removed from the
conventional hinge 200 to allow access to a recess 204 for receiving an Allen
key. Once the Allen key has been inserted in the recess 204, pushing down
and rotating the Allen key allows the tension in the torsion spring 206 to be
adjusted so the conventional hinge 200 closes with the desired force. Hence,
a closing force provided by the at least one biasing element of the first,
conventional hinge 200 is adjustable and can be matched according to the
dampening force provided by the hinge 100 according to the present
invention.
[0051]       If the closing force provided by the at least one biasing element of
the first, conventional hinge 200 is not adjustable, the one or more dampeners
118 of the hinge 100 according to the present invention can be selected
according to the closing force provided by the conventional hinge(s) 200
available. Alternatively, or additionally, the position at which the dampeners
118 commence damping the closure of the hinges can                   be adjusted
accordingly.
3295156vl

                                           9
[0052]       Hence, according to another form or aspect, the present invention
resides in a hinged arrangement comprising a first conventional hinge 200
hingedly attached to a door, gate, screen or barrier or the like, the first
conventional hinge 200 comprising at least one biasing element, such as a
torsion spring 206, to bias the door or gate or screen or the like towards a
closed position. The hinged arrangement comprises a second hinge 100
according to the present invention hingedly attached to the door, gate, screen
or barrier or the like to dampen movement of the door, gate, screen or barrier
or the like towards the closed position.
[0053]       Hence, embodiments of the present invention address or at least
ameliorate the aforementioned problems of the prior art by providing a hinge
having one or more dampeners to slow the closure of the hinge thus reducing
vibration and damage upon closure to both the hinge and the door, gate,
barrier or the like connected to the hinge. The hinge of the present invention
uses less material and has a relatively simple construction compared with at
least some of the prior art hinges, thus reducing manufacturing costs and
likelihood of failure. The hinge of the present invention is used with a
conventional biasing hinge as described herein which avoids the need for two
"specialist" hinges to be used and enables one of a pair of conventional
hinges already in use to be replaced with the hinge of the present invention.
The adjustable nature of the one or more dampeners enables the position at
which damping commences to be finely tuned, thus maximising the utility of
the hinge of the present invention. The one or more dampeners can be
selected according to the level of dampening required for the particular
application. Therefore, the hinge of the present invention is more versatile
than many of the prior art hinges because the same hinge structure can be
used for different applications with one or more differently rated dampeners.
Omission of a biasing element, such as a torsion spring, from the hinge of
present invention provides a hinge with a longer useful life compared with at
least some of the prior art hinges.
[0054]       In this specification, adjectives such as first and second, left and
right, top and bottom, and the like may be used solely to distinguish one
element or action from another element or action without necessarily requiring
or implying any actual such relationship or order. Where the context permits,

interpreted as being limited to only one of that integer, component, or step, but
rather could be one or more of that integer, component, or step, etc.
