                                       ABSTRACT
It is a product, which protects from the cold like any other Blankets or Quilts. But this
product is designed in such a way, that even after few rollovers by the users/couples the
Couple Blanket will remain in the stationary position. This Couple Blanket is a multi
layered fabric, One is Quilt and another one is Blanket (the width/length of the blanket is
longer than the width/length of the Quilt). The lower surface of the Quilt is sewed with
satin fabric and the upper surface of the Blanket is sewed with again satin fabric. This
will take way most of the friction between the Quilt and the Blanket. When a user tries to
roll away from the other user, the blanket will roll with the user keeping the Quilt in the
stationary position. This will help couples/users to have cover from cold all the time
while they are sleeping even after few rollovers.

                                    COUPLE BLANKET
Every couple who is sharing a bed may not have a good night sleep. One of the main
reasons could be sharing a blanket. At first, many couples try to share and adjust with a
single blanket, after lots of rollovers they end up have two separate blankets. One may
end up in pulling all the blanket towards him/her side or one may end up in losing all the
blanket to the other person leaving him/her self-exposed to cold. This problem can be
solved by the Couple Blanket. This will provide a good night sleep even after few
rollovers. It's consists of multilayered fabric, one is Quilt and the other is Blanket. Both
Quilt and Blanket are separated by a satin fabric on both the surfaces of Quilt and a
Blanket. This satin fabric acts as a lubricant ( slippery surface) between Quilt and a
Blanket.
Construction:
One side of the Quilt is been sewed with satin fabric and one side of the blanket is also
sewed with another satin fabric. This satin fabric acts as a slippery surface between
Quilt and a blanket.
Now a blanket is sewed onto the lower surface of the Quilt in such a way that the two
satin surfaces of the quilt and blanket face each other. The width/length of the blanket
will be longer than the width/length of the Quilt, but the blanket is being stitched within
the perimeter of the Quilt. Leaving excess blanket along the width/length of the Quilt.
 The arrangement of Couple Blanket as follows:
Layer 1 - Quilt.
Layer 2 - Satin fabric sewed to the bottom surface of the Quilt.
Layer 3 - Satin fabric sewed to the top surface of the Blanket.
Layer 4 - Blanket.
Working Principle:
Imagine you are standing near the head end of the bed and two personals are sharing
this Couple Blanket in front of you. Let's name left person as X and right person as Y. If
X rotates anti-Clockwise the blanket also rotates with X in the same direction, but Quilt
does not turn, this is due to the smooth frictionless surface of the satin fabric to the satin
fabric in between Quilt and the Blanket . The same principle goes to the Y in a
clockwise direction. In both the cases, the Quilt is at a stationary position, regardless of
the movement of X and Y.

Drawbacks with traditional Blankets / Quilts:
   * These are single layered, hence they can be easily pulled over while rollovers.
   " Since they are single layered, they may not provide as warmth as in double
     layered Couple Blanket, because Air which acts as an insulator is not present
     between the Quilt and the Blanket.
   " Can be kicked away towards the legs side of the bed.
Advantages of Couples Blanket:
   * On rollovers, the Quilt is at the stationary position regardless the movement of
     the users. Hence users will be under the Couple Blanket all the time while
     sleeping, unlike other traditional Blankets and Quilts.
   * The couples can share a single blanket (Couples Blanket) instead of two.
   * Provides more warmth than other traditional Blankets / Quilts. Because Air acts
     as an insulator between Quilt and the Blanket.
   * If a couple is using two blankets, then there is a need to wash them separately
     since they do not fit in a single average size washing machine.
   * This is designed for couples, but it can be manufactured for single users ,
     especially for kids, who have a habit of kicking off their Blanket/Quilt in sleep.

                                         CLAIMS
My claims are as follows:
   1) Any multi-layered fabric/product/material attached/sewed in such a way that it
       provides/enhances lubrication/f rictionless environment within the multi layered of
      the fabric/product/material.
   2) Using frictionless fabric/material/product between any multi layered
      fabric/products/material. So that in the arrangement of multi layered fabrics
      allows them to slide/slip with one an other.
   3) Stitching bottom fabric (Blanket/Quilt/any fabric), which is
       longer/wider/bigger/closer to the user in length/width/size/distance respectively in
      comparison to the top fabric (Blanket/Quilt/any fabric), which is
      shorter/smaller/further to the user in length/size/distance respectively to the
       bottom fabric (Blanket/Quilt/any fabric).
   4) Stitching bottom fabric (Blanket/Quilt/any fabric), which is
       longer/wider/bigger/closer to the user is sewed within the perimeter of the top
      fabric (Blanket/Quilt/any fabric), which is shorter/smaller/farther to the user.
