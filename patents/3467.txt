                                                INFUSION PUMPS
BACKGROUND
1.       Field
         The present devices and methods relate generally to ambulatory infusion pumps.
2.       Description of the Related Art
         Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an
admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field.
         Ambulatory infusion pumps (also referred to herein simply as "infusion pumps") are relatively
small, at least substantially self-contained devices that are used to introduce drugs and other infusible
substances (collectively "medicament") into patients' bodies. Some infusion pumps are configured to be
worn on a belt or carried in a clothing pocket. Other infusion pumps are configured to be adhered to skin
in patch-like fashion. Infusion pumps are advantageous in that they may be used to, for example,
subcutaneously introduce (or "infuse") medicament on an ongoing or even continuous basis outside of a
clinical environment. Infusion pumps are also advantageous in that they greatly reduce the frequency of
subcutaneous access events such as needle-based shots. One example of a medicament that may be
introduced by an infusion pump is a liquid formulation of insulin, which is a relatively large protein
molecule used to treat diabetes mellitus. Other exemplary medicaments that may be introduced by an
infusion pump include, but are not limited to, drugs that treat cancers and drugs that suppress the
perception of pain.
         Many conventional infusion pumps have improved patient health and quality of life.
Nevertheless, the present inventors have determined that conventional infusion pumps are susceptible to
a wide range of improvements. By way of example, but not limitation, the present inventors have
determined that it would be desirable to provide an infusion pump that is smaller, more accurate and/or
provides more operational flexibility than conventional infusion pumps.

The section titles and overall organization of the present detailed description are for the purpose of
convenience only and are not intended to limit the present inventions.
         It should also be noted here that the specification describes a wide variety of structures and
methods, mainly in the context of cartridge-based infusion pumps that are especially well-suited for the
subcutaneous delivery of very high concentration insulin (e.g., the U-500 insulin discussed below).
Nevertheless, it should be appreciated that the present inventions are applicable to a wide variety of
infusion pumps and medicaments. By way of example, but not limitation, many of the present inventions
are also applicable to infusion pumps that are not cartridge-based (e.g., pumps with refillable reservoirs
and single use pumps). Also, although the illustrated embodiments may employ a cartridge with a
plunger, a fluid displacement device in the form of a plunger pusher, and a drive mechanism that
includes a motor, other fluid displacement devices may include, regardless of the type of cartridge or
reservoir employed, piston pumps (e.g., electromagnet pumps), MEMS pumps, peristaltic pumps and any
other suitable pumps as well as corresponding drive mechanisms. The present inventions are also
applicable to medicaments such as, for example, drugs to mask pain, chemotherapy and other cancer
related drugs, antibiotics, hormones, GLP-1, Glucagon, various other drugs that include large molecules
and proteins that may require a high level of delivery accuracy, as well as to relatively high concentration
insulin (i.e., U-200 and above) such as U-400 insulin.
I.       INTRODUCTION
         From the perspective of most patients, two important aspects of ambulatory infusion pumps are
size and convenience. As noted above, some ambulatory infusion pumps are frequently intended to be
worn on a belt, carried in a pocket, or otherwise supported within a holder of some kind (referred to
collectively as "pocket pumps"). Such infusion pumps transfer fluid from a reservoir to an infusion set by
way of an elongate tube. Subcutaneous access may be obtained by way of a cannula in the infusion set.
Other ambulatory infusion pumps are intended to be adhered to the skin at the delivery site (sometimes
referred to as "patch pumps"). Here, the cannula or other subcutaneous access device may extend directly
from the infusion device. Given these modes of use, patients typically prefer the pump to be as small as
possible so that the pump will be more comfortable, less obtrusive, and less visible.
         One commercially available ambulatory infusion pump is the OmniPod@ insulin pump from
Insulet Corporation in Bedford, Massachusetts. The OmniPod@ insulin pump has overall dimensions of
about 62.5 mm x 42.9 mm x 17.7 mm, i.e., has an overall volume of about 47.5 cc, and has a reservoir
volume of about 2.0 cc. Although this pump is relatively small, many patients would prefer an even
smaller pump. Reducing reservoir volume is a simple method of reducing the overall size of an infusion
pump. Unfortunately, when the volume of the reservoir is reduced, all other things being equal, there is a

corresponding reduction in convenience because the smaller reservoir requires more frequent refilling or
replacement.
         The present inventors have determined that smaller reservoirs can be employed, without a
corresponding reduction in convenience, by increasing the concentration of the medicament dispensed
therefrom. In the exemplary context of insulin therapy, some conventional infusion pumps have
reservoirs which hold 2 milliliters (ml) of U-100 insulin. U-100 insulin is an insulin containing 100
international units (IU) of insulin activity per 1 ml and, accordingly, the 2 ml reservoir stores 200 lUs.
One common insulin dose is 0.5 IU, which equates to a dispensed volume of 5 microliters (pl) of U-100
per dose, 400 doses per 2 ml reservoir, and about 4.5 days of therapy at the common dosage. At least
some conventional infusion pumps are capable of delivering 5 pl/dose with a delivery accuracy level that
is acceptable for relatively low concentration U-100 insulin.
         Higher concentration insulins are, however, commercially available. Humulin@ R U-500 insulin,
which is available from Eli Lilly and Company in Indianapolis, Indiana, contains 500 IU/ml. Although
the use of high concentration insulin would facilitate the use of a much smaller reservoir (e.g., 300 IU in
a 0.600 ml reservoir), and could result in much smaller pumps for a given number of dosages, the five
fold increase in insulin concentration (as compared to U-100 insulin) necessitates a five-fold increase in
fluid delivery accuracy. U-500 insulin is currently administered by injection and with certain
conventional insulin pumps for patients who require more than about 200 IU/day. The accuracy of
certain conventional pumps is adequate for patients who require about 200 IU/day or more. For example,
conventional insulin pumps generally alert the patient (e.g., with an alarm) when approximately 3 lUs of
U-100 insulin are missed on delivery, which corresponds to 30 pl of missed delivery. Using U-500
insulin, the missed volume for a 3 lUs alert is reduced to six pl due to the higher insulin concentration,
and conventional infusion pumps are not capable of this level of accuracy.
         The present inventors have determined that there are a plethora of factors that must be addressed
if the goal is to deliver 1 pl/dose at an acceptable level of delivery accuracy. For example, the six pl alert
requirement means that the present infusion pump assembly must be very stiff (or "low compliance") to
ensure delivery accuracy over all conditions of operating pressures, frictions, temperatures and so forth.
In the context of the exemplary cartridges described below, the displacement may be about 1 IU of U
500 insulin per 0.001 inch of stroke, i.e., 2.0 pl/0.001 inch of stroke. The present inventors have
determined that factors which can contribute to accuracy/precision during drug delivery may include:
rotational accuracy of gearform (wobble and gearform consistency); encoder resolution; motor
backdrive; encoder consistency (rotational spacing); motor phase balance; and motor control circuit
excitation consistency (excitation pulse width accuracy and switch accuracy). The present inventors have
determined that factors which can contribute to axial (error) movement under load may include: thrust
bearing (internal movement); thrust bearing (slip in mount); lead screw (axial deformation); nut-to-lead
screw gearform deflection; plunger body compression; plunger body-to-seal axial slip; plunger seal-to
low friction layer axial slip; thrust bearing-to-lead screw axial slip; cartridge body deformation/axial slip;

lead screw-to-transverse gear axial slip; lead screw-to-transverse gear axial slip; push rod-to-nut axial
deformation; cartridge body hydraulic expansion; sense diaphragm hydraulic deflection; infusion set
hydraulic expansion; cannula movement in cartridge extending or shortening fluid path; and fluid path
bubble compression. The relevance of many of these factors is discussed below in the appropriate
contexts.
         Another convenience related issue identified by the present inventors relates to the fact that a
patient may desire to use a pocket pump in some instances and a patch pump in others. In addition to the
added expense, switching between two different infusion pumps may adversely effect the patient's
medicament delivery regimen. Notwithstanding the desire of some patients to switch back and forth, the
mere fact that some patients prefer a pocket pump while others prefer a patch pump forces manufacturers
to choose between designing, testing and obtaining approval for two different pumps or simply staying
out of one of the markets.
II.      SYSTEM OVERVIEW
         Exemplary ambulatory infusion systems, which are generally represented by reference numerals
10, 11 and 12 in FIG. 1, include a medicament cartridge (or "cartridge") 100, an ambulatory infusion
pump assembly (or "pump assembly") 200, and one of the baseplates 500, 501 and 502. Generally
speaking, the cartridge 100 may be inserted into the pump assembly 200 and the appropriate baseplate
500-502 may be secured to the pump assembly. To that end, and as discussed in greater detail in Section
V below, the baseplates 500-502 in the illustrated implementations are configured for different modes of
system operation. Baseplate 500 is a body adherable baseplate that may be used in conjunction with a
cannula (e.g., cannula 600 in FIGS. 56-57) that is directly connected to the cartridge 100 so that the
system 10 may be deployed as a "patch-pump" (FIG. IA). Baseplate 501 is configured to connect the
cartridge 100 to an infusion set 503 so that the system 11 may be deployed as a "pocket pump," a "belt
worn pump" or some other wearable pump (FIG. 1B). Baseplate 502 is a medicament non-delivery
baseplate that may be used to seal the cartridge 100 during periods of non-use (e.g., by way of plug 504),
thereby defining a non-use system 12.
         In other words, using the same medicament cartridge (e.g., cartridge 100) and pump assembly
(e.g., pump assembly 200), the user may configure the system for use as "pocket pump" or a "patch
pump" by simply selecting the appropriate baseplate 500 or 501 and attaching the baseplate to the pump
assembly. The user may also switch from one configuration to another, in many instances without
removing the cartridge from the pump assembly, by simply removing one baseplate and replacing it with
another baseplate.
         Whether configured as a "pocket pump" or a "patch pump," the system may be configured to
provide basal delivery of medicament in accordance with a delivery profile provided by a physician by
way of a clinician's programming unit. For example, the system may include a program that stores a
number of delivery profiles (e.g. delivery profiles associated a 24-hour delivery cycle and delivery
profiles for particular situations such as sleep or illness). Each delivery profile specifies multiple doses

(or pump "operations") over time, e.g. a particular number of doses at particular times or a particular
number of doses per unit time. In some implementations, a dose may be the volume associated with the
minimum controllable displacement of a cartridge plunger. The system may also be configured to
provide bolus delivery in response to an instruction from a patient remote control. A bolus instruction
may come in response to a high glucose level measurement in the case of a diabetic patient, an increase
in pain level in the case of a pain management patient, or some other symptom. The system may also be
configured to perform other functions, such as ending medicament delivery, in response to instructions
from a patient remote control.
         The parts of the present systems that do not come into contact with medicament during normal
operation (e.g., operation not associated with a cartridge that is damaged and leaking) may be considered
the reusable parts, while the parts that do come into contact with medicament during normal operation,
and may define portions of the medicament delivery (or "flow") path, may be considered the disposable
parts. In the illustrated embodiments, the pump assembly 200, which includes structures such as the
motor and various mechanical structures, the controller and the battery (and may be more expensive), is
reusable, while the cartridge 100, baseplates 500-502 and cannula 600 (if any) are disposable.
         The pump assembly 200 in the exemplary system 10 (and 11) does not come into contact with
medicament because the cartridge 100, which is accessible from outside the pump assembly 200,
includes its own manifold. Medicament can, therefore, flow directly from the cartridge reservoir to the
associated cannula or other device without contacting the pump assembly. Such an arrangement is
advantageous for a variety of reasons. For example, portions of the medicament delivery path from the
reservoir to the cannula (or infusion set tube) can become clogged or otherwise in need of repair. Such
repair may be inconvenient and costly in the context of many conventional infusion pumps because the
pump mechanism (e.g., a piston or peristaltic pump) is part of the medicament delivery path. The present
systems obviate this unpleasant aspect of some conventional infusion pumps by removing the
medicament flow path from the reusable portion of the system. The present systems also provide less
expensive long term therapy, as compared to many conventional systems, because the more expensive
portions are reusable.
         The infusion pumps described herein address the accuracy/precision factors and the axial
movement factors noted above by providing a more accurate, less compliant infusion pump. For
example, the constructions of the cartridge (e.g., the inside diameter is constant, and the plunger is
configured to be urged precisely in response to movement of the drive mechanism), the rigidity of the
chassis and the precision of the drive mechanism, as well as the operation procedures of the drive
mechanism, allow for an amount of medicament of 0.1% or less of the total filled volume of the reservoir
to be controllably dispensed with single-dose precisions that range from plus or minus (+/-) 20% to +/
5%. This precision can be obtained after a dispensing period of six to eight hours or less resulting in a
dose accuracy of from +/- 20% to +/- 5%. The dispensed amount can be as low as 0.23-0.27 pl/dose. The

dose can be dispensed in as little as two seconds or less for small volumes, or longer times for larger
volumes such as those associated with basal delivery.
         For example, 300 units of U-500 insulin (0.6 mL or 600 pl) can be provided in the reservoir of
one of the cartridges described below, and within a two hour or less stabilization period, medicament can
be controllably dispensed from the cartridge with a precision of +/- 5% and with 0.5 unit per dose (1.0
pl/dose). As graphically illustrated in FIG. 2, the ability to obtain a single-dose precision of better than
+/- 5% in as little as six to eight hours or less is vastly superior to the standard set forth in the
International Electrotechnical Standard (IEC) for the safety of infusion pumps and controllers (IEC
60601-2-24), which provides for a 24-hour stabilization period before precision measurements are even
taken. In other words, although the IEC 60601-2 delivery test provides a twenty-four hour stabilization
period during which pump operation is allowed to be untested, the present pumps, from a clinical
perspective, may be tested without such a stabilization period. This "time-to-precision" superiority is
especially important in the context of high concentration medicaments because the adverse effects of
prolonged over-delivery or under-delivery are magnified. For example, a "time-to-precision" of six hours
may be appropriate in the context of U-500 insulin and Type-I diabetics who use basal rates of less than
one IU/hour.
         The precision capabilities associated with the present system, and the corresponding ability to
use a very highly concentrated medicament (e.g., U-500 insulin) and relatively highly concentrated
medicaments (e.g., U-200 to U-400 insulin) also facilitate, if so desired, a marked decrease in ambulatory
infusion pump size as compared to conventional pumps. For example, one exemplary pump assembly
100 described below has dimensions of about 40 mm x 32 mm x 11 mm, for an overall volume of about
14 cc. This is considerably less than the approximately 47 cc overall volume of the aforementioned
OmniPod@ insulin pump.
III.     EXEMPLARY MEDICAMENT CARTRIDGES
         The exemplary system is, as noted above, a cartridge-based system in that medicament cartridges
100 are inserted into the pump assembly 200 and later removed from the pump assembly. The cartridges
100 may also be, but are not required to be, prefilled and disposable. Prefilled cartridges are
advantageous for a variety of reasons. By way of example, but not limitation, some users prefer to avoid
cartridge filling procedures because they are inconvenient and tend to involve needles. User-based
refilling also increases the likelihood that air bubbles will be introduced into the cartridge, while
prefilling by the manufacturer of the cartridge and/or the medicament can be accomplished without any
substantial introduction of air bubbles using, for example, a vacuum filling procedure. A lack of bubbles
is very important in the context of dosage accuracy in that air is compressible and liquid medicament is
not. For example, 20 pl of air will have a compressibility of about 6 pl at a 5 psi operating pressure,
which can adversely effect pressure sensing in the system. If the system is configured to alert the user of
missed dosing equal to approximately 6 pl (3 lUs for U-500 insulin), 6 pl (3 lUs for U-500 insulin) will
be delayed before there is a user alert. In addition, the presence of 20 pl of air in the cartridge results in

the patient not receiving 10 lUs of U-500 insulin during the life of the cartridge. Prefilled cartridges with
less than 5 pl of air bubbles are preferred when U-500 is the stored medicament.
         As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, the exemplary medicament cartridge 100 may include a body
portion (or "barrel") 102, which defines a medicament reservoir 104, a plunger 106 that is held by
friction within the body portion, and a manifold 108 that may be used to connect the reservoir to, for
example, cannulas and baseplate structures in the manner described below with reference to, for
example, FIGS. 57 and 63. Medicament is identified by reference numeral 101 in FIG. 23. The plunger
106 is moved within the body portion 102 to vary the volume of the reservoir 104. In particular, the
plunger 106 moves in a dispensing direction where reservoir volume is decreased, but does not
substantially move to increase volume during use of the cartridge 100. The cartridge 100 may also be
provided with a plug 110 that prevents leakage from a prefilled reservoir 104 (e.g., prefilled in a vacuum
with U-500 insulin) during packaging, shipping, storage and handling, and can be used in a pusher
zeroing procedure as described in Section VIII-B below.
         Referring first to the body portion 102, and although the present inventions are not limited to any
particular shape, the exemplary body portion 102 is cylindrical in overall shape and has a cylindrical
inner surface 112 that defines the cylindrical reservoir 104 (FIG. 3). The body portion 102 and inner
surface 112 may be other shapes in other implementations. By way of example, but not limitation, the
overall shape of the body portion 102 and the shape of the inner surface 112 may both be oval in cross
section, or the overall shape of the body portion may be rectangular and the shape of the inner surface
may be oval or circular in cross-section. The inner surface 112 may also be a non-curved, such as
rectangular or square in cross-section.
         The exemplary manifold 108 illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4 has a body portion 114 that defines a
through-bore 116 and the front wall 117 of the cartridge. The through-bore 116 is directly connected to a
relatively short reservoir outlet port 118 (i.e., is connected without additional tubing). The through-bore
116 and outlet port 118 facilitate a direct fluidic connection between the cartridge 100 and the
aforementioned cannulas and baseplates that have a portion thereof inserted into the through-bore. The
reservoir outlet port 118 may also be parallel to the direction of plunger movement (note FIG. 54). Such
an orientation results in a short, direct and efficient medicament dispensing path as the plunger 106
reduces the volume of medicament in the reservoir 104.
         Additionally, as illustrated in FIG. 4A, the inner surface of the body portion end wall 119, i.e.,
the wall that the plunger 106 abuts when the reservoir is empty, may include an annular recess 121 which
traps bubbles that may be present in the reservoir and prevents them from exiting the cartridge 100. In
one exemplary implementation, the annular recess 121 is a 0.25 mm deep semi-circle in cross-section, is
0.5 mm from the circumferential edge of the outlet port 118, and is 0.5 mm wide (i.e., 0.5 mm from the
ID to the OD). Such bubble entrapment reduces the likelihood that bubbles will be dispensed and,
accordingly, reduces the likelihood that medicament dispensing and occlusion sensing will suffer bubble-

related decreases in accuracy. Other ways to trap bubbles at the end wall 119 include, but are not limited
to, concentric recesses, hydrophilic filters and elevated outlet ports.
          At least some of the exemplary implementations may employ pressure data in various contexts.
For example, a pressure sensor may be used to detect occlusions downstream from the reservoir outlet
port 118 that are impeding, or completely preventing, medicament flow. To that end, a medicament
cartridge may include some or all of the pressure sensor itself. In the illustrated implementation, the
cartridge 100 includes the cartridge portion 120 of the pressure sensor 234 that is described in Section
IV-H below with reference to FIGS. 41 and 42. The pressure sensor may also be used to detect the
presence of a cartridge in the pump assembly, as is also described below.
          The exemplary pressure sensor cartridge portion 120 illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4 includes a
pressure sensor housing 122, which may be integral with (as shown) or otherwise connected to or carried
by the manifold 108, and a detectable structure 124. The detectable structure 124, whose movement can
be detected as described below, is mounted in a pressure sensor housing recess 126 and communicates
with the through-bore 116 by way of an aperture 128 so as to expose the detectable structure to the fluid
pressure in the through-bore. As shown in FIG. 5, the exemplary detectable structure 124 has a
deflectable part 130 with a magnet 132 (e.g., a neodymium magnet), a resilient diaphragm 134 (e.g., a
silicone diaphragm) that carries the magnet by way of a sleeve 136, and a diaphragm retention ring 138
(e.g., an olefin polymer retention ring). The exemplary detectable structure 124 also has a cap 140 with a
cylindrical abutment 142, a bore 144 in which the magnet 132 and sleeve 136 are located, and a flange
146. During assembly, the detectable structure 124 is inserted into the housing recess 126 until the
retention ring 138 abuts the recess wall 148 (FIG. 4). The cap 140 is thereafter inserted into the recess
126 until the cylindrical abutment 142 engages the retention ring 138 and the flange 146 is flush with the
pressure sensor housing 122 (FIG. 1). The diaphragm 134, which is exposed to reservoir pressure by way
of the aperture 128, flexes in response to pressure increases, such as during an occlusion event, thereby
moving the magnet 132. The movement is sensed by the pump assembly portion 236 (e.g., Hall-effect
sensor or magnetoresistive sensor) of the pressure sensor 234 as described in Section IV-H below with
reference to FIGS. 41 and 42. Thus, in this implementation, the cartridge portion 120 may be thought of
as the "unpowered" portion of the pressure sensor 234 and the pump assembly portion 236 may be
thought of as the "powered portion." Moreover, the more expensive portion, e.g., a sensor such as a Hall
effect or magnetoresistive sensor, is part of the reusable pump assembly 200.
          Generally speaking, air (not medicament) acts on the diaphragm 134 because of the air cushion
formed between the plug 110 and diaphragm during manufacture. That said, the sensor 234, which
includes the cartridge portion 120, can detect a pressure change corresponding to six pl of medicament
(i.e., the three IU of U-500 insulin) or less of plunged medicament that is being held up by a blockage.
The six pl of medicament generally corresponds to the volume created by deflection of the detectable
structure 124 (note FIG. 42).

          Another exemplary cartridge portion of a pressure sensor is generally represented by reference
numeral 120a in FIG. 6. The cartridge portion 120a may be part of a medicament cartridge 100a that is
otherwise identical to cartridge 100. Cartridge portion 120a is substantially similar to cartridge portion
120 and similar elements are represented by similar reference numerals. For example, the cartridge
portion 120a includes a detectable structure 124a. Here, however, the diaphragm 134a includes a post
136a on which a cylindrical magnet 132a is mounted. In other words, instead of the magnet 132a being in
a sleeve, this magnet 132a defines a sleeve. The diaphragm 134a also includes an integral mounting
member 138a that is press-fit into the recess 126 with a cylindrical wedge 142a.
          It should also be noted that the present pressure sensors are not limited to the type of devices
described with reference to FIGS. 5 and 6. By way of example, but not limitation, a cartridge portion
120b (FIG. 7) may include a diaphragm that carries a magnetically permeable structure 132b which
changes the inductance of a coil in the pump assembly portion PAP of the sensor when moved relative
thereto. A similar arrangement may employ an optical element and a corresponding optical sensor, and
FIG. 7 may also be considered a representation thereof (with the optical element represented by reference
number 132b). Another exemplary pressure sensor may be in the form of an electrical switch that
includes a pump assembly portion PAPI with a pair of switch contacts and a cartridge portion 120c with
a diaphragm which carries an electrical conductor 132c that connects the contacts when the diaphragm
moves a predetermined distance (FIG. 8).
          With respect to dimensions, the exemplary cartridge 100 may be configured to have a reservoir
104 whose volume is less than or equal to about 1000 pl and, some implementations, between about 500
700 pl. For perspective, and as noted above, a 600 pl (0.600 ml) reservoir would store 300 units of U
500 insulin, which corresponds to about one week's worth of insulin for a patient using approximately 40
IU of insulin per day. Such volumes may achieved by way of a body portion 102 with an inner diameter
of 9.8 mm, with a tolerance +/- 1.0 mm in some instances and a tolerance of +/- 0.1 mm in others, an
outer diameter of 11.8 mm, with a tolerance +/- 1.0 mm in some instances and a tolerance of +/- 0.10 mm
in others, a stroke length (i.e., the distance that the plunger 106 travels from the full position to the empty
position) of 8.5 mm +/- 2.0 mm, and a length of 17.5 mm, with a tolerance of +/- 1.0 mm in some
instances and a tolerance of +/- 0.10 mm in others.
          It should be noted here that the stroke length to inner diameter ratio of the present reservoir 104
may be about 1.0 or less. For example, in some implementations, the ratio may be 0.86, or may range
from about 0.75 (or less) to about 1.0.
          The plunger may play a substantial role in the dosage accuracy associated with the present
system. The exemplary plunger 106 illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 9-12 includes a plunger body 150, a seal
152, and a friction reduction layer 154 that provides a low coefficient of friction between the friction
bearing surface of the plunger 106 and barrel inner surface 112.
          Referring more specifically to FIGS. 10 and 12, the plunger body 150 may be spool-shaped, in
that it is a solid structure with a recessed middle portion 156 and circumferential rings 158. The recessed

middle portion 156 and circumferential rings 158 extend circumferentially around the axis A (FIG. 12).
Indentations 159 may be provided for a portion of the friction reduction layer 154. The spacing between
circumferential rings 158 and the barrel inner surface 112 may be relatively small, i.e., there is close
tolerance, to minimize plunger wobble. For example, the diameter of the rings 158 may be about 9.7 mm
with a tolerance of +/- 0.06 mm and the spacing can be 0.10 mm with a tolerance of +/- 0.073 mm in
some instances and a tolerance of +/- 0.12 mm in others. The plunger body 150 also has forward and
rearward facing (relative to the direction of plunger travel during medicament dispensing) surfaces 160
and 162. Put another way, with reference to the medicament in the reservoir 104, the surface 160 is the
"wet side" and surface 162 is the "dry side." The forward facing surface 160 may be provided with a
concave recess 164 that is at least substantially aligned with the reservoir outlet port 118. A generally
annular indentation 165 extends into the plunger body 150 from the rearward facing surface 162. In
addition to reducing the weight of the plunger 106, the indentation facilitates removal of the plunger
body from the mold during manufacture.
          In other implementations, the plunger body may be planar on the wet and/or dry sides. Such a
plunger body would resemble the simplified illustration of plunger body 150 in FIG. 34. The plunger
body surfaces interfacing with the inner surface of the barrel may also be cylindrical, that is, planar in
cross section as opposed to rounded.
          Referring to FIGS. 10-12, the seal 152 may be located between the plunger body 150 and the
friction reduction layer 154, and within the plunger body recessed middle portion 156 between the
circumferential rings 158. As such, the seal 152 in the illustrated implementation acts on the plunger
body 150, as well as the friction reduction layer 154, and is radially and axially constrained. The seal
152, which may include an annular base portion 166 and a pair of o-rings 168, also provides enough
force to press the friction reduction layer 154 outwardly against the inner surface 112 of cartridge body
102 and establishes a seal that will hold under the pressures associated with the present systems and
methods. Moreover, given the radial and axial constraints, the amount of seal compression (and the
resulting sealing force) is more predictable than it would be otherwise.
          The seal 152 is under radial and axial compression forces which provide a sealing load on both
the friction reduction layer 154 and the plunger body 150. The radial and partial axial compression forces
also force the friction reduction layer 154 outward against the cartridge barrel inner surface 112.
Overcompression is undesirable as the resultant seal has a wide range of static/running forces, so
compression is engineered to be within a predictable range.
          The seal 152 may also be provided with a plurality of protrusions 170 (FIGS. 11 and 12), such as
integrally molded protrusions, on the forward facing surface 172 (as shown) and/or on the rearward
facing surface (not shown). The protrusions 170 ensure that the seal 152 is axially stable (or properly
constrained) between the plunger body circumferential rings 158, and will typically be compressed into
the annular base portion 166 as shown in FIG. 12. Constraining the seal 152 in this manner makes it
more likely that the seal will accurately track movement of the plunger body 150 and, in turn, facilitates

accurate reduction in reservoir volume. The protrusions 170 also prevent overcompression of the
exemplary seal 152 in the plunger body 150, which could lead to unpredictable seating and unpredictable
forces on the friction reduction layer 154 and, therefore, on the cartridge barrel 102.
         It should also be noted here that the plunger 106 in the illustrated embodiment is not connectable
(or "is unconnectable") to the plunger pusher 250 (note FIGS. 45-47) that pushes the plunger forwardly
toward the outlet port 118. Put another way, and referring to FIG. 12, the plunger body 150 does not
include any structural components that are (or could be) connected to the plunger pusher. For example,
the plunger body 150 does not include an unthreaded opening, a threaded opening, a fastener, a magnetic
catch, a ratchet, or other such instrumentality. The dry side of the plunger body could also be planar (and
noted above). Given the lack of connectability, under no circumstances will reverse movement of the
plunger pusher 250 pull the plunger 106 rearwardly and draw medicament back and air (if any) into the
reservoir 104. The plunger 106 can only move forwardly when being contacted by, and/or due to
operation of, the plunger pusher 250.
         Although there are numerous possible configurations that would not be connectable to a plunger
pusher, the exemplary plunger body 150 simply has a smooth rearward facing surface 162 that may be
planar (as shown in the simplified illustrated presented in FIG. 34) or curved. Additionally, or
alternatively, the plunger pusher 250 (note FIGS. 18, 23 and 25) may be unconnectable to the plunger, as
is discussed in Section IV-D below, for the same reasons.
         With respect to materials, the body portion 102, manifold 108 and plunger body 150 of the
exemplary cartridge 100 may be formed from plastic, glass or a combination of glass and plastic, and the
seal 152 may formed from rubber, such as bromobutyl rubber. The body portion 102 and manifold 108
may be integrally formed, or formed separately and joined to one another (e.g., by ultrasonically or laser
welding). One suitable plastic is cyclic olefin polymer (COP). It should be noted, however, that the
particular medicament that is to be stored in the cartridge 100 should be taken into account. For example,
each milliliter of Humulin@ R U-500 insulin contains 500 units of biosynthetic human insulin, 16 mg
glycerin, 2.5 mg Metacresol as a preservative, and zinc-oxide calculated to supplement endogenous zinc
to obtain a total zinc content of 0.017 mg/100 units. Sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid may be
added during manufacture to adjust the pH. Other ingredients, such as phenol (preservative), surfactants,
and buffering agents may be added as required. As such, Humulin@ R U-500 insulin may be better suited
for long term storage in glass than it is for long term storage in plastic. In those instances where storage
in a plastic cartridge (e.g., a COP cartridge) is desired due to the inherent advantages of plastic as
compared to glass (e.g., lighter, less expensive and more durable), a bioequivalent of Humulin@ R U-500
may be employed. Here, the formulation of Humulin@ R U-500 may be adjusted to increase the stability
of the insulin by, for example, changing preservative, changing stabilizers, and changing buffering
agents.
         In at least some implementations, the cartridge body portion 102 may be formed from
transparent glass, transparent COP or some other suitable transparent material. There are a variety of

advantages associated with a transparent cartridge body portion 102. For example, as shown in FIG. 17
and discussed in Section IV below, the pump assembly 200 and cartridge 100 are respectively configured
such the body portion 102 will protrude through an opening 226 in the housing top wall 214 when the
cartridge is inserted into the pump assembly. In one implementation, the cartridge 100 will protrude less
the one mm (which equates to five percent of the volume of reservoir 104). The patient will be able to
see the medicament in reservoir 104 and readily determine, when for example the medicament is insulin,
whether or not the medicament is cloudy (which indicates a loss of effectiveness), as well as roughly
estimate what portion of the original medicament volume remains in the reservoir.
         The friction reduction layer 154 in the exemplary embodiment may be formed in a variety of
ways. The friction reduction layer 154 may be, for example, a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sleeve that
is shrink wrapped over the plunger body 150 and seal 152 (as shown in FIG. 12). Ethylene
tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), which are in the same family as
PTFE, may also be employed. Alternately, the friction reduction layer 154 can be implemented as a low
friction coating or surface modification of the seal 152. Coatings could be formed from a fluorinated
polymers such as FEP and PTFE. When combined with a COP cartridge body portion 102 and the other
above-described aspects of the plunger 106, the present friction reduction layer 154 provides a break
force (static friction) of less than five pounds and running forces (dynamic friction) of two to four or five
pounds.
         As to the exemplary plug 110 illustrated in FIG. 3, and as alluded to above, the plug is a
removable sealing device that is inserted into the cartridge through-bore 116 during manufacture to
prevent leakage from a prefilled reservoir 104, by way of the outlet port 118, during packaging, shipping,
storage and handling. The plug 110 will typically remain in place in the through-bore 116 until the
cartridge 100 is in place within the pump assembly 200 and is ready for medicament dispensing. At that
point, the plug 110 will be manually removed by the user. Although the plug 110 is not limited to any
particular configuration, the implementation illustrated in FIG. 3 includes a bulbous head 174 and a stem
176. The head 174 may have a disk portion 178 and a plurality of gripping protrusions 180, while the
stem 176 may have a plurality of spaced sealing rings 182 carried on a cylindrical member 184. Suitable
material for the plug 110 includes, but is not limited to, bromobutyl rubber. An internal core (not shown),
such as a fiber core, may be provided in some instances in order to prevent the plug from ripping during
manual removal subsequent to the pusher zeroing procedure described in Section VIII-B below.
         In some instances, long term interaction between the medicament and the pressure sensor
diaphragm (e.g., diaphragm 134) during shipping and storage may be problematic. Accordingly, in at
least some implementations, the respective configurations of the cartridge 100 and plug 110 are such that
the pressure sensor aperture 128 will be isolated from the reservoir outlet port 118 by a portion of a fully
inserted plug. For example, at least one of the sealing rings 182 may be between the pressure sensor
aperture 128 and reservoir outlet port 118 when the plug is fully inserted.

          Another exemplary plunger, which is generally represented by reference numeral 106a in FIG.
13, includes a plunger body 150a, a forward (relative to the direction of travel) o-ring seal 152a, and a
friction control device 152b that is spaced from the o-ring seal. The friction control device 152b may be
in form of an o-ring (as shown) or in the form of an overmolded part in some embodiments. The friction
control device 152b provides for a consistent, reliable resistance of the plunger 106a to pushing force
(e.g., from the plunger pusher) and may be configured such that at least one pound of force is required to
push and move the plunger. This functionality may be accomplished in a variety of ways. For example,
the o-ring seal 152a and friction control device 152b may be formed from different materials, and/or may
be differently shaped, and/or may be differently sized. For example the o-ring seal 152a may be made of
chlorobutyl rubber or bromobutyl rubber, and the friction control device 152b of silicone or
polytetrafluoroethylene.
          At least some embodiments of the present pump assembly 200 include a latch or other
mechanism that prevents the cartridge 100 from simply falling out of the pump assembly when the
associated baseplate is removed. Here, a small amount of pushing force (via the top opening 226 in FIG.
15) and/or pulling force (via the insertion opening 218 in FIG. 16) is used to remove the cartridge.
Turning to FIG. 14, a medicament cartridge (e.g., cartridge 100) may be provided with a pull tab 186 that
allows the user to pull the cartridge from the pump assembly 200 and/or simply makes the cartridge
easier to grasp in those instances where pulling force is not required. In the illustrated example, the pull
tab 186 has a main portion 188 that is firmly secured to the cartridge 100 and a handle portion 190. The
handle portion 190 may include a low tack adhesive to hold it to the cartridge body until the time of use.
Alternatively, the handle portion 190 may simply hang free or may be pushed out of the way (shown by
dotted lines). Instead of and/or in addition to the pull tab 186, an outward bias device (such as one or
more springs) may be mounted to the cartridge or within in the cartridge compartment. Pull-out ribbons
may also be provided.
IV.       EXEMPLARY PUMP ASSEMBLIES
          Briefly, the exemplary pump assembly 200 may include an external housing ("housing"), which
is generally represented by reference numeral 202 in FIG. 15, and a pump module, which is generally
represented by reference numeral 204 in FIG. 18, that is located within the housing. Other structures that
may be carried within the housing 202 include, but are not limited to a rechargeable battery 238, a circuit
board controller 240 and an alarm 242, as are illustrated in FIG. 18. When the medicament cartridge 100
is inserted into the pump assembly 200, as illustrated in FIG. 23, the cartridge plunger 106 of the
medicament cartridge 100 will be proximate to and facing the plunger pusher 250 of the pump module
204. The drive mechanism 252 of the pump module may then drive the pusher 250 relative to the
cartridge plunger 106 to controllably and precisely dispense medicament from the cartridge reservoir
104.
          A.       Exemplary Housings

          Referring first to FIG. 15-17, the housing 202 has a top portion 206 and a bottom portion 208.
The top portion 206, which includes two side walls 210, two end walls 212, a top wall 214 and rounded
corners therebetween, generally defines the internal volume in which the pump module 204 and other
pump assembly components are carried, as well as the overall volume of the pump assembly 200. The
bottom portion 208 includes a bottom wall 216, which functions as a cover for most of the internal
volume, and an insertion opening 218 in the bottom wall through which the cartridge 100 is inserted into
the cartridge receiving (or "cartridge storage") area 220. The outer surface of the top wall 214 defines the
"top face" or "top surface" of the housing 202, and the outer surface of the bottom wall 216 defines the
"bottom face" or "bottom surface" of the housing. In the illustrated embodiment, the insertion opening
218 abuts a thin rim 356 that is flush with the exterior surface of the bottom wall. The rim 356 is part of
the chassis 244 (FIG. 14) of the pump module 204.
          The configuration of the pump assembly 200 generally, and the housing 202 and insertion
opening 218 in particular, is such that the cartridge 100 is inserted through the insertion opening 218 and
into the cartridge receiving area 220 in a direction that is normal to plunger pusher 250, as well as the
axis along which the plunger pusher travels (note FIGS. 1 and 80).
          The top wall 214 of the housing 202 may also be provided with one or more openings. For
example, a through-bore opening 224 may be provided in the housing top wall 214 to provide access to
the cartridge through-bore 116 (FIGS. 3-4). Such access may be required during a cannula insertion
process, such as that described below with reference to FIGS. 45-48.
          The top wall 214 of the housing 202 may also be provided with an opening 226 for the cartridge
body 102 (or "cartridge body opening 226") in some implementations. The through-bore opening 224
and cartridge body opening 226 are merged into a single cartridge opening in the illustrated embodiment.
Such openings may be separate in other embodiments. As alluded to in Section III in the context of the
exemplary cartridge 100, an opening facilitates observation of the medicament and plunger in a cartridge
formed from transparent material. Additionally, in the illustrated embodiment, the pump assembly 200 is
configured (i.e., sized, shaped, etc.) such that a portion of the associated cartridge (e.g., cartridge 100)
may protrude through the cartridge body opening 226 when the cartridge is in the cartridge receiving area
220. For example, the relative configurations of the cartridge 100 and pump assembly 200 may be such
that the cartridge body 102 protrudes slightly (e.g., about 0.40-1.00 mm, or five percent of the reservoir
volume) through the opening 226 in the housing top wall 214, as is illustrated in FIG. 17. The cartridge
body inner surface 112 will, however, be located below the inner surface of the top wall 214. The length
of the cartridge body opening 226 is substantially equal to the length of the cartridge body 102, with
appropriate clearance, while the width is somewhat less than the diameter of the cartridge body. For
example, the width of the opening 226 may be about 60 to 90% of the diameter and is about 83% in the
illustrated implementation.
          One important advantage of the cartridge/pump assembly relationship described in the preceding
paragraph is size reduction. Allowing a portion of the cartridge 100 to protrude through the cartridge

body opening 226 eliminates the need to accommodate that portion of cartridge below the inner surface
of the housing top wall 214, which in turn allows for a reduction in the overall thickness (or "profile") of
the pump assembly 200. The reduction is equal to the sum of the length of the protrusion, the thickness
of the housing top wall 214, and any clearance that would have been necessary between the inner surface
of the top wall and the cartridge in a "cartridge enclosed" implementation. In the context of ambulatory
infusion pumps, where every reduction in size is important, this is a significant savings.
         The pump assembly 200 may also be configured (i.e., sized, shaped, etc.) such that a portion of
the associated cartridge (e.g., cartridge 100) protrudes through the insertion opening 218 on the bottom
surface of the housing 202 when the cartridge is in the cartridge receiving area 220. In such an
implementation, the associated baseplate (e.g., baseplate 500) may be provided with an aperture 508 (or a
recess) to accommodate the protruding portion of the cartridge as is discussed in Section V below with
reference to FIGS. 53-55. Typically, although not necessarily, the cartridge 100 will not protrude
substantially beyond the bottom surface of the baseplate or will not protrude beyond the bottom surface
of the baseplate at all. Protrusion of the cartridge through the insertion opening 218 affords the same size
related advantages as the cartridge opening 226 in the housing top wall 214, which is to reduce the
thickness of the housing 202.
         A plurality of electrical contacts 228, 230 and 232 may extend through (or be carried on) the
housing bottom portion 208, as is illustrated in FIG. 16. As discussed in greater detail in Sections IV-J
and VI below, two of the contacts (e.g., contacts 228 and 230) may be used to electrically connect the
pump assembly 200 to a battery recharger (e.g., charger 700 in FIG. 49) and all of the contacts, at least in
some implementations, may be used by the pump assembly during a baseplate identification procedure
described.
         With respect to dimensions, some embodiments of the exemplary housing 202 may have the
following dimensions: length dimensions of 42 mm +/- 1.0, 42 mm+/- 0.10, 40 +/- 1.0 mm, 40 +/- 0.10
mm or 40 +/- 5.0 mm; width dimensions of 34 mm+/- 1.0, 34 mm+/- 0.10 mm, 32 mm+/- 1.0 mm, 32
mm+/- 0.10 mm or 32 mm +/- 5 mm; overall thickness or height dimensions of 11 mm+/- 1.0 mm or 11
mm+/- 0.10 mm; and wall thickness dimensions on the order of 1.0 mm +/- 0.10 mm. Suitable housing
materials include, but are not limited to, plastic or other materials having a modulus of elasticity of 0.2
1.0 million psi.
         B.       Exemplary Pump Module Overview
         As noted above with reference to FIG. 15, internal components of the exemplary pump assembly
200 may include, among other things, the pump module 204, rechargeable battery 238, circuit board
controller 240 and alarm 242. Exemplary pump modules are described below with reference to FIGS. 18
39. Other components may include the pump assembly portion 236 of a pressure sensor.
         C.       Exemplary Chassis
         Briefly, and referring first to FIG. 18, the exemplary pump module 204 may have a rigid chassis
244, which is configured to form a cartridge compartment 246 that defines the cartridge receiving area

220, a plunger pusher (or "pusher") 250 that drives the cartridge plunger 106 (FIG. 25) in the dispensing
direction, and a drive mechanism 252 that drives the plunger pusher in the dispensing (or "forward")
direction and the retraction direction. The rigid chassis 244 may, among other things, provide a low
compliance, very rigid mounting structure for receiving and securely holding the medicament cartridge
100 relative to the plunger pusher 250, and is shown in FIGS. 23 and 25.
         The chassis 244, and thereby the pump module 204, may be molded snap in, hooked, bonded or
attached with fasteners to the bottom portion 208 of the pump assembly housing 202. As can be seen in
FIG. 16, when the chassis 244 is positioned in the housing 202, the large bottom opening 248 directly
communicates with the medicament cartridge receiving area 220. The exemplary chassis 244 also
includes an opposing, and smaller, top opening 254 that directly communicates with the top wall opening
226 in the housing 202, as shown in FIGS. 15 and 17.
         Turning to FIG. 20, the components of the exemplary chassis 244, which is described in
extensive detail below, may include a first side frame member 256, a second side frame member 258, an
end gear cap 260, two long fasteners 262, two shorter fasteners 264, a connector bar 266 (FIG. 21), and
two spring bias clips 268. The exemplary rigid chassis 244 is shown in exploded form in FIGS. 21 and
22 to illustrate the various chassis components and the assembly thereof.
         The first side frame member 256 illustrated in FIGS. 21 and 22 may include a first side
longitudinal portion 270, a rear transverse dog leg 272, a bulging portion 274, a first forward recessed
area 276 defining part of the cartridge compartment 246 and a first forward transverse portion 278
defining another part of the cartridge compartment 246. The longitudinal portion 270 has an outer
elongate recessed area 280 ending at the bulging portion 274, which has a through-hole 282. A first half
284 of a circular longitudinal opening 350 (FIG. 18) may be formed at the rear of the cartridge
compartment 246 by the first side frame member 256. The longitudinal portion 270 may have a side
through-opening or window 287 at a forward location in the cartridge compartment 246. In some
embodiments, the opening 287 may be sealed with a transparent cover such as a transparent film. The
dog leg 272 may have two large fastener openings (or "holes") 286 and two small fastener openings 288
in a rearward face 290. Engagement portion 292 extends inwardly from the longitudinal portion 270 and
the forward transverse portion 278 and into the cartridge compartment 246. The forward transverse
portion 278 may have a side opening 294. Top and bottom body plate portions 296, 298 extend inwardly
from the longitudinal portion 270, forwardly from the dog leg 272 and rearwardly from the cartridge
compartment 246.
         The second side frame member 258 illustrated in FIGS. 21 and 22 may include a second side
longitudinal portion 300, a second forward recessed area 302 defining part of the cartridge compartment
246 and a second forward transverse portion 304 defining part of the cartridge compartment 246 and
having a transverse through-hole 306. An engagement portion 308 extends into the cartridge
compartment 246 from the second side longitudinal portion 300 and the second forward transverse
portion 304. As shown in FIG. 21, two spaced recessed areas 310 may be formed on the inward surface

of the second side longitudinal portion 300 and at the cartridge compartment 246, and lateral through
openings 312 may be formed at upper ends of these recessed areas, as can be seen in FIG. 22. A second
half 314 of the large longitudinal opening 350 may be formed at the rear of the cartridge compartment
246, as shown in FIG. 21. A longitudinal through-opening 316 may be near the second half 314 of the
opening, as can be seen in FIG. 21, and through a wall 318 of the second side frame member 258. The
wall 318 forms a portion of the aft wall 320 (FIG. 18) of the cartridge compartment 246. The rear end of
the second side frame member 258 may include a wall 322 extending between top and bottom body plate
portions 324, 326 and inward from the second side longitudinal portion 300. As can be seen in FIG. 22,
the wall 322 may include upper and lower openings 328, 330.
         It may be noted here, with reference to FIGS. 16 and 17, that the chassis engagement portions
292, 308 at least in substantial part define the periphery of the top opening 254 of the chassis 244. The
engagement portions 292, 308 may also form abutment surfaces for the medicament cartridge 100 to
block a top surface of the medicament cartridge from impacting the housing 202 as a small portion of the
cartridge extends through the housing opening 226 (FIG. 17).
         The exemplary end gear cap 260 illustrated in FIGS. 21 and 22 may be formed by a body portion
332 having a bulging portion 334 and a flat inward back face 336. Referring to FIG. 21, the inward back
face 336 may include two small recess openings 328, 330, a first one in the bulging portion 334 and a
second one close to the first one, as well as a central circular large recess opening 338. The outward rear
surface of the body portion 332 may have two recessed wells 340, each communicating with respective
through-openings 342, and two recessed wells 346, each communicating with respective through
openings 348, as shown in FIG. 21.
         The configuration of the exemplary chassis 244 allows the chassis to be subsequently
disassembled and reassembled in order to, for example, retrieve, repair and/or replace components of the
pump module 204.
         The assembly of the chassis components can be understood from a comparison of FIGS. 21 and
22 to FIGS. 18 and 20, with an emphasis on the dotted lines in FIGS. 21 and 22. The order of the
assembly steps may be varied from those set forth below as would be apparent to those skilled in the art.
Operative positions of the components of the drive mechanism 252 (FIG. 18) and drive line 344 (FIG.
25) in and relative to the chassis 244 are described below with reference to FIGS. 23 and 25, for
example.
         As part of the exemplary assembly method, bottom ends of the spring clips 268 are fitted into (or
otherwise affixed in) bottom ends of the respective recessed areas 310. The clips 268 are compressed
slightly and their upper ends are inserted into the upper ends of the respective recessed areas 310 and into
the respective openings 312. The clips 268 are thereby compressed and bulging slightly into the cartridge
compartment 246, as can be seen in FIGS. 18 and 19. Thus, when the medicament cartridge 100 is in the
cartridge compartment 246, the spring clips 268 bias the cartridge 100 to and against the opposite wall of
the cartridge compartment. This not only helps to insert and releasably hold the cartridge 100 in the

cartridge compartment 246, but also pushes the cartridge 100 closer to the chassis window 287 to hold
occlusion sensor components in fixed relation as is discussed in detail in Section IV-H.
         The first and second side frame members 256, 258 are positioned together as part of the chassis
assembly process. When positioned together, the connector bar 266 is inserted in through the through
hole 306 and into the opening 294 to thereby connect the first and second transverse portions 278, 304
together. Alternatively, the connector bar 266 may be inserted into the through-hole 306, the first and
second side frame members 256, 258 positioned together and the connector bar 266 then pushed into the
opening 294.
         With the first and second side frame members 256, 258 positioned together and the end gear cap
260 positioned against the rearward face 290 of the dog leg 272 of the first side frame member 256, it
can be understood from the drawings that many of the holes or openings will align for operative insertion
therein of respective fasteners. Specifically, and referring to FIG. 22, holes 286, 330, 342 will align for
receipt therein of fasteners 262 with the heads 263 disposed in the wells 340; and holes 288, 348 will
align for receipt therein of fasteners 264 with the heads 265 disposed in the wells 346. The heads 263 and
265 are disposed in their respective wells, and do not extend out exposed beyond the outer surface
envelope of the end gear cap 260, as can be seen in FIG. 20.
         Referring to FIG. 22, the two longer fasteners 262 pass through respective holes 342 in the end
gear cap 260 and the first and second side frame members 256, 258. In contrast, the two shorter fasteners
264 do not extend into the second side frame member 258, but only through holes in the end gear cap
260 and the first side frame member 256. This arrangement has the advantage that the fasteners 262, 264
not only attach the gear cap 260 to the first and second side frame members 256, 258, but also attach aft
ends of the side frame members together and in a relatively compact construction.
         When the chassis 244 is assembled, the first and second halves 284, 314 (FIG. 21) adjoin to form
the circular longitudinal opening 350 (FIG. 18). The opening 350 extends between the cartridge
compartment 246 and the chassis chamber 352 illustrated in FIG. 21. The top surface of chamber 352 is
formed by the adjoining top plate portions 296, 324 and the bottom surface is formed by the adjoining
bottom plate portions 298, 326. The opening 316 (FIG. 18), which is adjacent to the opening 350, also
extends between the cartridge compartment 246 and the chamber 352.
         As can be understood from the drawings, including FIGS. 18, 19 and 20, the bulging portions
274, 334 of the first side frame member 256 and the end gear cap 260, respectively, are similarly
configured such that when the end gear cap 260 is attached to the first side frame member 256 the
bulging portions 274, 334 mate and form a continuous smooth curving surface.
         The cartridge compartment bottom opening 248 (FIG. 18), which is formed when the first and
second side frame members 256, 258 are mated, may have a generally rectangular shape with three right
angle corners and one rounded corner 354, which is shown in the bottom perspective views of FIGS. 18
and 20. The bottom opening 248 may be formed or defined by a rim 356, as shown for example in FIGS.
19 and 20 and described above. The opening 248 and the cartridge compartment 246 itself may be

configured to receive therein with a relatively close fit the medicament cartridge 100. The opening 248,
cartridge compartment 246 and medicament cartridge 100 may be configured so that there
advantageously is only one orientation in which the cartridge 100 may be inserted into the cartridge
compartment 312.
         With respect to materials, the chassis 244 may be made, for example, of ceramic, plastic filled
with a stiffening material, glass-reinforced plastic, carbon reinforced plastic, aluminum, steel, titanium or
other metal. The chassis 244 may be formed of a material having a modulus of elasticity greater than 1
million psi, 3 million psi, 10 million psi or 10-30 million psi. This is considerably more rigid than the
material of the housing 202 itself. Turning to dimensions, in some implementations, the chassis 244 may
have a length of 40 mm+/- 1.0, 40 mm+/- 0.10 mm or 37.0-41.0 mm; a thickness of 9 mm+/- 1.0, 9 mm
+/- 0.10 mm or 8.9-9.1 mm; and a width of 16 mm +/- 1.0, 16 mm+/- 0.10 mm, or 15.8-16.2 mm. The
cartridge compartment 246, in turn, may have a length of 19 mm +/- 1.0, 19 mm +/- 0.10 mm or 18.8
19.2 mm and a width of 12 mm+/- 1.0, 12 mm+/- 0.10 mm or 11.8-12.2 mm. The cartridge compartment
246 also may help shield the medicament 101 (FIG. 23) in the medicament cartridge 100 from heat
generated by the rechargeable battery 238 (FIG. 18) during dispensing and/or recharging procedures.
         As an example, the configuration and construction of the present chassis 244 may contribute to a
frame and drive line rigidity sufficient to withstand axial loads to ten pounds without extension greater
than 0.0005 inch through 200,000 rotational (turns) cycles or 400 axial cycles. Axial cycles refer to the
nut 364 traveling down the lead screw 360 (discussed below with reference to FIGS. 23 and 25).
         D.       Exemplary Plunger Pushers and Drive Mechanisms
         The exemplary pump module 204 illustrated in FIG. 18 includes, as noted above, a plunger
pusher 250, to push the cartridge plunger 106 in the dispensing direction, and a drive mechanism 252 that
drives the plunger pusher. Generally speaking, the exemplary drive mechanism 252 may, in some
instances, include a motor 358, a lead screw 360 (FIG. 23), a gear assembly 362 (FIG. 19) operatively
between the motor and the lead screw, a drive nut 364 (FIG. 23) attaching the pusher to the lead screw,
and a thrust bearing 370 (FIG. 23). Each of these components is discussed in greater detail below.
         As illustrated for example in FIG. 23, the exemplary plunger pusher 250 may be a hollow,
generally cylindrical structure that includes a plunger engagement surface 366. The pusher 250 may, in
some instances, have a flange (not shown) that prevents rotation of the pusher with the lead screw 360.
Additionally, as noted in Section III above in the context of exemplary medicament cartridge 100, the
exemplary pusher 250 may be configured such that it is not connectable (or "is unconnectable") to the
cartridge plunger 106. Put another way, and referring to FIG. 23, the exemplary plunger pusher 250 does
not include any structural components that are (or could be) connected to the plunger pusher. For
example, the plunger pusher does not include external threads, a fastener, a magnetic catch, a ratchet, or
other such instrumentality. The plunger engagement surface 366 may, for example, simply be planar as
shown. Given the lack of connectability, under no circumstances will reverse movement of the plunger
pusher 250 pull the plunger 106 rearwardly and draw medicament back into the reservoir 104.

         Suitable materials for the plunger pusher 250 include, but are not limited to, stainless steel,
polystyrene and polycarbonate. The dimensions will correspond to the other aspects of the overall
system. For example, the plunger pusher 250 may have an outer diameter (or other "thickness"
dimension of 6 mm +/- 1 mm and a length of travel of 8.5 mm +/- 2.0 mm.
         With respect to the drive mechanism 252, and referring first to the motor, and although the
present inventions are not limited to any particular motor, the exemplary motor 358 may be a stepper
motor such as, for example, the Faulhaber ADM 0620 motor. The Faulhaber ADM 0620 motor has a 6
mm diameter, a planetary gearhead of 256 reduction, and the specifications of the motor are set forth at
www.faulhaber.com. A stepper motor may in some instances control angular displacement and speed
more precisely than a DC motor. Motors other than stepper motors, including DC motors, may be
employed in the present pump assemblies.
         Turning to the lead screw, and referring to FIG. 23, the exemplary lead screw 360 is connected to
the plunger pusher 350 by a drive nut (or "retaining nut") 364 such that the rotational motion of the lead
screw 360 may be translated into axial movement of the pusher 250. In other words, the drive nut 364 is
in contact with the lead screw 360 and propels the pusher 250. The exemplary drive nut 364 may be
molded with the pusher 250 or may be pressed into a flange of the pusher. Alternatively, the pusher 250
and drive nut 364 may be integrally machined of the same material or the pusher may be molded with
internal threads.
         The lead screw 360 and the drive nut 364 may be made of material that allows axial movement
within an exemplary 0.0005 inch overall chassis "stretch" budget under a ten pound load through
200,000 rotational cycles or 400 axial cycles. The lead screw 360 may have a gearform accuracy in
rotation of better than .0005" to prevent apparent missed delivery increment, and may have a 70%
mechanical efficiency. The diameter of the lead screw 360 may be relatively small (e.g., 3.0 mm) to help
minimize the size of the pump module 204. The threads 368 of the exemplary lead screw 360 may be
Acme threads to provide high efficiency and precision, and may have a 0.5 mm lead pitch
(approximately 0.020 inch/revolution).
         An exemplary drive line 344 may be defined, as is illustrated in FIG. 28, by the retaining nut
364, lead screw 360 and thrust bearing 370. The thrust bearing 370 may be on the non-threaded shaft end
372 of the lead screw 360. The thrust bearing 370 may also be selected, for example, to allow axial
movement within an exemplary 0.0005 inch overall chassis "stretch" budget under a 10 pound axial load,
and have an axial length of 2 mm, an inner diameter of 2 mm and an outer diameter of 6 mm.
         The thrust bearing may be a conventional ball bearing, angular contact bearing, or, as illustrated
in FIG. 28, it may be a combined radial/thrust bearing of the type represented by reference numeral 370.
The thrust bearing 370 may include ball bearings 374, a retainer 376 that guides the ball bearings, a
thrust washer 378, and radial ball bearings 380 that ride on the thrust washer and also ride on a thrust
face of a drive gear 382. The radial ball bearings 380 may take up the thrust of the lead screw 360 in the
retraction direction. The drive gear 382 may be integrally machined with, or welded or bonded to, a

portion of the lead screw 360 such as the non-threaded shaft end 372. The radial bearings 384 may be
pressed onto the shaft 372 and, to resist axial force, pressed or bonded into the rear wall of the chassis
244 or more specifically into the opening 338 (FIG. 21) in the gear cap 260. As an example, the
combined radial/thrust bearing 370 may be configured to resist ten pounds of axial force during
medicament 101 dispensing from the medicament cartridge 100 and four pounds of axial force during
retraction of the pusher 250.
         Turning to FIG. 19, which shows the exemplary pump module 204 with the gear cap 260
removed therefrom for explanatory purposes, the drive gear 382 on the lead screw 360 is one of three
gears of a transverse gear train 384. The other two gears may be a planetary gearbox output gear 386 and
a transverse gear 388 that is operatively positioned between the drive gear 382 and the output gear 386.
As illustrated in FIG. 21, the shaft 390 of the transverse gear 388 is fixed in the gear cap opening 392 and
the gear 388 freely rotates on the shaft 390. The gear cap and first side member bulging portions 336,
274 define part of a gear box for the transverse gear train 384. Lubricant may be provided in the gear box
to reduce the friction between the gears therein.
         The transverse gear train 384 may be selected to withstand gearform loads of 10 mNm output
torque at the motor 358. The accuracy of the gearform in rotation may be better than 0.0005 inch to
prevent apparent missed delivery increment (decremented by the gear ratio closer to the motor output).
The transverse gear train 384 may have a 2:1 gear ratio.
         The exemplary gear assembly 362 may also include a planetary gearbox 394. The planetary
gearbox 394 may be selected to withstand gearform loads of 10 mNm output torque at the motor 358,
and may have a 256:1 gear ratio.
         As illustrated for example in FIGS. 18 and 19, the drive mechanism 252 may also include an
encoder 396 positioned on the shaft of motor 358 opposite the planetary gearbox 394. The encoder 396
may be used to define/resolve the number of revolutions (or "angular displacement") and/or the
rotational direction of the motor shaft. The displacement/direction information is sent to the controller
240 and used to control various operations of the pump assembly 200, as is discussed in greater detail in
Section IV-L (among others) below. Briefly, during normal operation, the controller 240 sends paired
drive signals to the motor 358 (stepping pulses) while monitoring the pulse train back from the encoder
396. For example, the number of encoder signals (or "ticks") for a particular dispensing operation may be
calculated, encoder 396 is monitored in near real time to determine if it is moving as predicted. The
encoder 396 may also be used to detect gear assembly issues as well as motor operation errors.
         As is also illustrated in FIGS. 18 and 19, the motor 358, planetary gearbox 394, and encoder 396
together define a cylinder. The cylinder fits in a compact manner partially into and against the outer
recessed surface 280 of the chassis first side frame member 256. Turning to FIGS. 23 and 25, when
viewed in plan, the exemplary drive mechanism 252 defines a U-shape with one leg of the U being
defined by the longitudinal axis of the motor 358, planetary gearbox 394, and encoder 396, while the
other leg of the U is defined by the longitudinal axis of the lead screw 360. The two axes (or legs of the

U) are only 9.5 +/- 1.0 mm apart in the illustrated embodiment. The base of the U is defined at least
substantially by the transverse gear train 384.
          In at least some instances, it may be desirable to detect when the plunger pusher 250 is in the
fully retracted (or "home") position illustrated in FIGS. 18 and 29. This may be accomplished in a
variety of ways. One exemplary structure for performing the retracted position detection function is the
position detector 398 illustrated in FIG. 29. The exemplary position detector 398 includes a switch 400,
which may be mounted to the chassis 244 aft of the opening 350, and a flange 402 that may be carried by
the pusher 250. When the pusher 250 is in the retracted position illustrated in FIG. 29, the switch 400 is
closed by the flange 402 and sends a signal to the controller 240 indicating that the pusher 250 is in the
home position. The switch is open when the pusher 250 is not in the home position and a portion thereof
is within the cartridge compartment 246.
          In other embodiments, different types of switches may be employed, or the flange may be
omitted and the switch positioned such that it will be closed by the pusher 250 when the pusher 250 is in
the retracted position. For example, switch contacts (e.g. a metalized pattern) may be carried on the
chassis 244 and a conductive pad may be carried on the flange 402. Non-mechanical detectors, such as
magnetic detectors and optical detectors, may be used in place of a switch. Additionally, regardless of the
type of detector employed, the detector may be configured to provide a signal to the controller 240 when
the pusher 250 is not in the retracted position.
          Another alternative is to simply detect that the motor encoder 396 is not turning when running
the motor 358 in reverse. To that end, a hard mechanical stop (not shown) may be provided at a location
that stops the pusher 250 and stalls drive mechanism 252 when the pusher reaches the home position.
Such a hard mechanical stop may be non-binding, i.e., configured such that the drive mechanism 252 can
be stalled by the stop but can also easily reverse without mechanism binding. Homing may be
accomplished by retracting the pusher 250 with controlled torque and speed until the pusher hits the hard
mechanical stop, thereby stalling the motor 358. Motor stall may be identified in response to the encoder
396 indicating no rotation. The expected stall (home) location may be remembered by the device and
compared to the actual stall position for additional control or, in at least some implementations, the motor
358 may be given a reverse displacement command that is larger than the total possible travel of the
drive mechanism 252, and the actual stall (home) position determined based on the stall of the motor.
The various techniques described herein for increasing motor torque in response to a motor stall to verify
stall position may be employed to improve this technique of home position determination by stalling at
the hard stop.
          E.       Exemplary Reservoir Clamping
          The arrangement, configuration and materials of the chassis 244 and drive line 344 in the
exemplary implementation together create a force "clamp" that is generally represented by reference
numeral 404 in FIG. 30. The clamp 404 clamps the reservoir 104 between the dry side of the plunger 106
and the outer surface of the cartridge front wall 117. Put another way, both ends of the reservoir 104 are

held in such a manner that movement of the reservoir relative plunger pusher 250 (e.g., due to cartridge
movement) may be prevented, and the corresponding loss of delivery accuracy prevented.
          The thick arrow 406 in FIG. 30 represents the action force associated with the pusher 250
pushing the plunger 106 as a result of rotation of the motor 358. The thin arrows 408 show the reaction
forces originating in the plunger 106, traveling back in the opposite direction through the drive line 344
and then forward through the fasteners 262 and 264, and through the chassis 244 to the front wall 117 of
cartridge 100. A reaction force 410 on the outer surface of the front wall 117 and opposite to the action
force 406 is thereby created. The force "clamp" 404 may be generally configured as a pair of oppositely
facing C-shaped clamps, as can be understood from FIG. 30.
          The clamping displacement of the reservoir 104 applied by the clamp 404 adjusts incrementally
as the cartridge plunger 106 is advanced towards the front wall 117 by the pusher 250. For example, the
clamping displacement may adjust incrementally by 0.00 1 inch. The exemplary clamp 404 may apply a
clamping displacement with, for example, a precision of better than 2% over a force range of zero to ten
pounds.
          F.       Exemplary Cartridge Lock and Bias Apparatus
          In at least some implementations, structure is provided to block removal of a cartridge from the
pump assembly when the plunger pusher 250 is in the cartridge 100, and to allow a cartridge to be
inserted into and removed from a compartment within the pump assembly when the pusher is retracted.
          One example of such as structure is the releasable, linear one-way clutch (or a "latching
mechanism," or an "interlock") that is generally represented by reference numeral 412 in FIGS. 23-27.
The clutch 412 blocks removal of a cartridge (e.g., cartridge 100) from the pump module 204 when the
plunger pusher 250 is in the cartridge, but allows the cartridge to be inserted into and removed from the
cartridge compartment 246 when the pusher is in a retracted "home" position.
          Referring first to FIG. 24, the exemplary clutch 412 may include a first coil spring 414, a first
pin or elongate member 416, a second coil spring 418, a second pin or elongate member 420, and a
"teeter-totter" toggle ball 422. The second elongate member 420 may include friction-engaging surface
428 (FIG. 27). The first coil spring 414 is positioned inside of the first elongate member 416 to form a
spring-biased first member 424. The second coil spring 418 is positioned in the second elongate member
420 to form a spring-biased second member 426.
          In one exemplary implementation, the first and second springs 414, 418 may each have one to
two pounds of spring force. The first spring 414 may have a one mm diameter, and the second spring 418
may also have a one mm diameter. The first and second elongate members 416, 420 may have respective
lengths of 12.5 and 7.25 mm. The second elongate member 420 may be a two mm diameter steel rod, and
the friction-engaging surface 428 may be a two to five degree beveled surface.
          With respect to operation of the exemplary clutch 412, the mode of the spring-biased first
member 424 determines whether the clutch 412 is in a locked condition (FIGS. 23 and 24) or an
unlocked condition (FIGS. 25 and 26). The spring-biased second member 426, when the pusher 250 is in

a non-retracted position, holds the spring-biased first member 424 in a friction-contact locked condition
with the friction-engaging surface 428. The cartridge 100 is thereby latched in place in the cartridge
compartment 246.
          The toggle ball 422 toggles when the pusher 250 is moved to the retracted home position. The
toggling action moves the spring-biased second member 426 to a position with the friction-engaging
surface 426 out of friction contact with the spring-biased first member 424. In this unlocked or unlatched
condition (FIGS. 25 and 26), the cartridge 100 may be removed from or inserted into the cartridge
compartment 246. In this fully retracted mode, the spring-biased first member 424 retracts when the
spring force of the first coil spring 414 therein is overcome by the force of a cartridge 100 being inserted
into or removed from the cartridge compartment 246.
          The spring-biased first member 424 may have a patterned end 430 with a sixty-degree beveled
face 432 on the cartridge insertion side, as shown in FIG. 24 for example. This beveled face 432
facilitates easy cartridge insertion, with a radius where the spring-biased first member 424 engages the
cartridge 100 in a small slot (not shown) for detent action. FIG. 18 shows the end 428 of the spring
biased first member 424 protruding or extending into the cartridge compartment 246 with the sixty
degree beveled face 432 disposed upwards. So positioned, the spring-biased first member 424 will
engage the inner surface 112 (FIG. 23) of the cartridge medicament cartridge when the medicament
cartridge is in the cartridge receiving area and, given the close fit between the exterior of the cartridge
and the interior of the chassis, removal will be prevented.
          More particularly, when the clutch 412 is in the locked condition illustrated in FIGS. 23 and 24,
the second member 426 intersects the first member 424 at generally five degrees with a light spring force
of 0.1 to 0.5 pound, biasing the spring-biased second member 426 towards the spring-biased first
member 424. That is, the second member 426 is spring biased towards the first member 424, and thereby
operates similar to a one-way roller clutch. Referring to FIG. 24, the first member 424 is on top with the
second member 426 below and intersecting at generally five degrees with the light spring bias of 0.1 to
0.5 pound. With the pusher 250 in any position other than the fully retracted home position (FIG. 25), the
second member 426 is self-energized by friction with the first member 424, thereby preventing rearward
motion of the first member 424. Then, when the pusher 250 is in a fully retracted position, the second
member 426 is moved slightly forward by the half ball toggle 422, releasing friction contact with the first
member 424. The spring-biased first and second members 424, 426 are thereby in the positions shown in
FIG. 26.
          In other words, when the pusher 250 is fully retracted, the first member 424 is biased towards the
cartridge 100 with a one to two pound spring force and acts like a spring plunger detent. In this fully
retracted mode, the first member 424 is able to retract when the spring force is overcome by cartridge
insertion or removal. Then when the pusher 250 is not fully retracted, the second member 426 locks the
first member 424 from rearward motion and blocks cartridge insertion and removal.

         The half ball toggle 422 may be formed from a two mm diameter steel ball, and may rest in a
spherical recess 434, such as one machined into a surface of the chassis 244. The half ball toggle 422
thereby can toggle the second member 426 forward when the pusher 250 retracts fully and engages the
half ball toggle 422, as can be understood from the arrows 436, 438, 440 in FIG. 23. Other toggling or
"teeter-totter" constructions may be used instead of the exemplary half-ball toggle 422. The clutch 412
also self-adjusts for cartridge 100 tolerance.
         The pusher 250 and the spring-biased first member 424 may be provided with o-ring sealing
surfaces (not shown) to help make the clutch 412 waterproof.
         The pusher 250 may be retracted automatically when the reservoir 104 is empty (see FIG. 25) as
discussed elsewhere in this disclosure, which thereby automatically causes the clutch 412 to be unlocked
when the reservoir is empty. Alternatively, by operating the remote control 1000 (see, e.g., FIG. 81), the
patient may cause the pusher 250 to be retracted before the reservoir 104 is empty, as when he wants to
remove the medicament cartridge 100 before it is empty and replace it with a new cartridge 100. This
retraction of the pusher 250 by the patient's instructions also causes the clutch 412 to unlock.
         Another way of describing the mechanism of the clutch 412 is that the mechanism functions as
an interlock that prevents removal of the medicament cartridge 100 from the receiving area 220 when the
cartridge 100 is in the inserted position and the pusher 250 is in a non-retracted position, and that allows
removal of the medicament cartridge 100 from the receiving area 220 when the cartridge 100 is in the
inserted position and the pusher 250 is in a retracted position. The interlock/clutch 412 automatically
unlocks the cartridge 100 when the pusher 250 is in the retracted position, and automatically locks the
cartridge 100 when the pusher 250 is advanced out from the retracted position.
         Additionally, one exemplary advantage of the aforementioned light spring bias is illustrated in
FIG. 31 in the context of system 10. When a user of the exemplary patch pump system 10 desires to
replace the cartridge 100, baseplate 500 and cannula 600, the pump assembly 200 may simply be pulled
off the baseplate. The baseplate adhesive (discussed below) will hold the baseplate 500 to the skin, the
cannula latch (discussed below) will hold the cannula to the baseplate, and frictional engagement
between the cannula and the cartridge through-bore will hold the cartridge to the cannula. In other words,
the reusable portion of the system readily and conveniently separates from the disposable portions.
         A further way to view the operation of the clutch 412 is that by operating the remote control
1000, a cartridge-biasing member (the spring-biased first member 424) may be changed from a blocking
condition, where the cartridge-biasing member (the spring-biased first member 424) blocks removal of a
medicament cartridge 100 from the pump module 204, to a release condition, where the cartridge-biasing
member (the spring-biased first member 424) does not prevent the medicament cartridge 100 from being
removed from the pump module 204. The clutch 412 biases the cartridge 100 forwards, acts as a spring
plunger detent during insertion of the cartridge 100 into the compartment 246, and prevents backwards
motion during use.

         When in a locked condition, the spring-biased first member 424 may engage and bias the
medicament cartridge 100 forward in the cartridge compartment 246. The cartridge 100 is thereby biased
to a "held" position to secure the cartridge 100 firmly in place, such as against a rigid wall of the chassis,
for accurate and precise medicament dispensing. The first member 424 may bias the cartridge 100
forward and thereby closer to the chassis window 287 (see FIG. 20) to fix the relative positions of
various occlusion sensor components, as discussed elsewhere in detail in this disclosure.
         Another exemplary structure that blocks removal of a cartridge from the pump assembly when
the plunger pusher is in the cartridge, and allows a cartridge to be inserted into and removed from a
compartment within the pump assembly when the pusher is retracted, is the sliding latch mechanism (or
"sliding latch") generally represented by reference numeral 412a in FIGS. 32-35A. The exemplary latch
412a is described below in the context of the pump assembly 200' and baseplate 500', which are
identical to pump assembly 200 and baseplate 500 but for minor accommodations for the latch 412a, and
similar   elements    are represented by similar reference numerals.           With respect to the      minor
accommodations, which are discussed below in context, the pump assembly housing 202' includes a
bottom portion 208' with a latch slot 209, the chassis 244' includes minor adjustments, the plunger
pusher 250' includes a recess 468, and the baseplate 500' includes a latch indentation 509.
         The sliding latch 412a is configured to secure the cartridge 100 in place when the pusher 250' is
at least partially in the cartridge 100, such as during the dispensing process. In addition to securing the
medicament cartridge 100 within the pump module 204', the sliding latch 412a biases the cartridge
forward to a "held position" against the rigid chassis front wall 245 when the pusher 250' is at least
partially in the cartridge 100. Such biasing facilitates accurate and precise medicament dispensing, and
ensures that the cartridge will be accurately located relative to the chassis window 287 (FIG. 20).
         Turning to the components of the exemplary sliding latch 412a, and referring to the bottom
perspective view presented in FIG. 32, the sliding latch includes a slidable latch member 442 with a
bottom lateral body member 444 as well as a pair of legs 446 (one shown) extending up from opposite
ends of the body member. A pair of abutment tabs 448 respectively extend rearwardly from the legs 446.
The bottom lateral body member 444 includes a pair of flange portions 452 and an arched (convex)
finger tab 456, with friction ridges 458, that is operatively accessible to the user when no baseplate
attached (FIGS. 33 and 34).
         A pair of rods 460 (one not shown) extend longitudinally through holes in the legs 446 and the
front ends of the rods are secured in a wall of the chassis 244, such as the aft wall 320 (FIG. 18). The rear
ends of the rods 460 are secured in a chassis flange 462. A pair of bias springs 464 (one not shown)
respectively encircle the rods 460 between the legs 446 and the flange 462, and bias the slidable latch
member 442 forward, towards the chassis cartridge compartment 246 and to a normal forward biased
position.
         When the latch member 442 is in the normal forward biased position, the ends of the flange
portions 452 will extend over the opening of the cartridge compartment 246, thereby blocking insertion

of a medicament cartridge (e.g., cartridge 100) into the pump assembly 200' as well as the removal of
cartridge from the pump assembly. When the pusher 250a is in a retracted home position, the slidable
latch member 442 is unlocked (as discussed below) and the user can slide the latch member rearward
against the bias force of springs 464 (FIGS. 32 and 33) within the housing slot 209. The latch member
442 reaches the rearward position when the tabs 448 abut the rear flange 462 (FIG. 32). Here, the flange
portions 452 no longer overlap the opening of the cartridge compartment 246 and block insertion (or
removal) of a cartridge.
         Turning to FIG. 33, the exemplary sliding latch 412a may also include a locking apparatus 466.
The exemplary locking apparatus 466 may include a recess 468 in the plunger pusher 250', a recess 470
in the lateral body member 444, a hole 472 in the chassis 244', and a movable ball 474 carried within the
hole. When the latch 412a is in the state illustrated in FIG. 33, which is the result of the user sliding the
lateral body member 444 to the rearward position, the movable ball 474 will be located within the pusher
recess 468. After a cartridge 100 is inserted into the cartridge compartment 246 and the user releases the
lateral body member 444, the springs 464 will push the lateral body member to the position illustrated in
FIG. 34. Here, movable ball 474 will be aligned with both the pusher recess 468 and the lateral body
member recess 470. Depending on the rotational orientation of the pump assembly 200', the movable
ball 474 will either be in the pusher recess 468 or the lateral body member recess 470. When the
baseplate 500' is attached as shown in FIG. 35, the user will no longer have access to the latch 412a and
the finger tab 456 will be located in the baseplate recess 509 (FIG. 35A). After the plunger pusher 250' is
moved forwardly by operation of the lead screw 360, the movable ball 474 will be held in the lateral
body member recess 470 and, given that a portion of the ball is also in the chassis hole 472, the lateral
body member 444 will held in place and the latch 412a will be in the locked state. The user will not be
able to unlock the latch 412a until the pusher 250' is returned to the home position.
         It should be noted that the relationship between the finger tab 456 and the baseplate slot 509 also
helps to facilitate proper alignment of the baseplate 500' relative to the pump assembly 200' and, for
example, proper alignment of the structures that are associated with the baseplate identification process
(described in Section VI below with reference to FIGS. 66-78) on the pump assembly (e.g., electrical
contacts 228, 230 and 232 in FIG. 16) and the baseplate (e.g., identification devices 582-0, 582-1 and
582-2 in FIG. 1).
         Another exemplary structure that blocks removal of a cartridge from the pump assembly when
the plunger pusher is in the cartridge, and allows a cartridge to be inserted into and removed from a
compartment within the pump assembly when the pusher is retracted, is the sliding latch mechanism (or
"sliding latch") generally represented by reference numeral 412b in FIGS. 36 and 37. The latch 412b
may be used in conjunction with, for example, the cartridges, pump assemblies and baseplates described
herein with the minor accommodations described below. The exemplary latch 412b is described below in
the context of the cartridge 100', which is identical to cartridge 100 but for minor accommodations for
the latch 412b, and the pump assembly chassis 244. Similar elements are represented by similar reference

numerals. With respect to the minor accommodations, which are discussed below in context, the
cartridge body 102 includes a slot 478 and the chassis wall 318 includes a longitudinal aperture 486.
         The exemplary latch 412b may include a latch element 476, which is carried by the chassis 244,
and is biased to a retracted, unblocking position by a spring 480. In the illustrated embodiment, the latch
element 476 includes a flange portion 482 and a thinner extension portion 484. The spring 480 may be
positioned between the chassis wall 318 (or some other fixed structure) and the flange portion 482. The
thinner extension portion 484 extends through the longitudinal aperture 486.
         The latch assembly 412b may also include a sliding latch tensioner 488 that slides relative to the
pusher 250 along a longitudinal axis of the pusher. A flange or other structure 490 may be secured to, or
be an integrally formed part of, the pusher 250 and may be positioned aft of the sliding latch tensioner
488. A tensioner spring 492 may be disposed between the sliding latch tensioner 488 and the flange 490.
The tensioner spring 492 may be stronger than the latch spring 480. As the pusher 250 is driven into and
against the plunger 106, the latch spring 480 compresses quickly, propelling the extension portion 484
into the cartridge slot 478 (FIG. 37), thereby preventing the cartridge from moving in a direction
orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the plunger 250. The tensioner spring 492 absorbs additional
propelling energy. The biasing force of the spring 480 pulls the extension portion 484 out of the cartridge
slot 478, thereby unlocking the latch, when the plunger 250 returns to the home position (FIG. 36).
         The clutch 412 (FIGS. 16-20) and the sliding latch mechanism 412a (FIGS. 27-27C), in addition
to performing latching/locking functions, also perform a pushing function. The latch assembly 412b
(FIGS. 36-37) may be adapted to perform a pushing function. They all are examples of structures that
perform the function of pushing (or "biasing") a medicament cartridge (e.g., cartridge 100) against a wall
and, more specifically, engaging an aft end of a cartridge and pushing the medicament cartridge that is in
the inserted position within the pump assembly against a rigid wall to a held position. The rigid wall
may, for example, be the front wall of the chassis 244. Other examples structures that performing these
function are schematically represented by reference numeral 494 in FIG. 38. Such structures include, but
are not limited to, coil springs, leaf springs, interfering bumps, interference fits, and deformable resilient
members. Such structures may be attached to the aft wall 320 of the cartridge compartment 246 or some
other structure.
         G.      Exemplary Encoders
         One aspect of present system control instrumentalities, which is applicable to variety of
individual control methodologies discussed herein, is monitoring the actual movement of the shaft of
motor 358. Specifically, the number of revolutions (or "angular displacement") and/or the rotational
direction of the motor shaft is resolved. For purposes of simplicity, rotation of the shaft of the motor is
simply referred to as rotation of the motor. The number of revolutions in the forward direction may be
used to determine the amount of medicament that has been dispensed. For example, in some
implementations, 14.4 revolutions may equal one pL and, accordingly, may equal 0.50 IU of U-500
insulin dispensed.

         A wide variety of apparatus may be used to monitor angular displacement and rotational
direction of the motor 358 so that the controller 240 can, for example, determine if the motor is moving
as predicted. Although the present inventions employ an encoder to perform this function, other
apparatus that may be employed include, but are not limited to, monitoring coil current of the motor. It
should also be noted that the present inventions are not limited to any particular type of encoder.
         In the exemplary embodiments, an encoder 396 may be positioned on the shaft of motor 358 in
the manner illustrated, for example, in FIG. 18. The motor/encoder relationship is schematically
represented in FIG. 39 and various exemplary encoders are described below with reference to FIGS.
40A-401. Briefly, during normal operation of at least one embodiment, the controller 240 sends paired
pulse/phase drive signals (stepping pulses) to the motor 358 while monitoring the pulse train back from
the encoder 396. The pulse trains associated with exemplary encoders are also presented in FIGS. 40A
401. The encoder 396 is monitored in near real time to determine if its movable portion associated with
the motor shaft 357 (and, therefore, the motor 358) is moving as predicted.
         Referring to FIGS. 40A, an exemplary encoder 396a may be an optical encoder. Such encoders
may have a light emitter 397, a photodetector 399, and one or more optical interrupters 401. The
interrupters 401 are positioned and/or configured so that a different waveform is produced when the
portion of the encoder 396a with the interrupters is rotated in a forward direction as opposed to a
rearward direction, as shown. The optic interrupters 401 in the exemplary encoder 396a are in the form
of two occluding tabs spaced apart at an angle other than 180 degrees. Turning to FIG. 40B, exemplary
encoder 396b has two encoder openings 401b spaced apart at an angle other than 180 degrees. An
exemplary encoder 396c with two reflective surfaces 401c, also spaced apart at an angle other than 180
degrees, is shown in FIG. 40C. The exemplary encoder 396d in FIG. 40D has a single encoder opening
401d with an asymmetrical shape that forms different forward and reverse waveforms. The occluding tab
40le in exemplary encoder 396e (FIG. 40E) is also asymmetrical and the waveform produced thereby is
different in the forward and reverse directions. The exemplary encoder 396f in FIG. 40F has openings
401 f of different size that result in a waveform that is different in the forward and reverse directions.
         Turning to FIGS. 40G-401, other exemplary encoders employ magnetic detectors. Such encoders
may include a sensor that senses changes in magnetic fields, such as a Hall-effect sensor or a
magnetoresistive sensor, and a magnet arrangement on or rotating with the motor shaft to produce
magnetic fields that are different in the forward and reverse directions of rotation. To that end, the
exemplary encoder 396g illustrated in FIG. 40G includes a sensor 403 and a magnet arrangement 405g,
with S-N-S magnetized domains, that produces the illustrated signal waveform. The exemplary encoder
396h (FIG. 40H) includes a magnet arrangement 405h with S-N-S magnetized domains and N-S-N
magnetized domains. Another exemplary encoder, which is generally represented by reference numeral
396i in FIG. 401, has a rotation axis that passes through a two-bar magnet arrangement 405i. Another
exemplary encoder 396j is illustrated in FIG. 51. Here, the rotating portion 405j includes a single magnet

and there is a pair of sensors 403a and 403b. Another exemplary encoder may be in the form of an
optical encoder with a pair of sensors.
         H.       Exemplary Pressure/Occlusion Sensors
         As discussed in Section III above, pressure sensors may be provided to, among other things,
detect occlusions in a cannula or infusion set tube. Occlusions may occur for any number of reasons
including, but not limited to, cannula kinks caused by movement of the pump assembly relative to a
deployed cannula, kinks in the infusion set tube, or granuloma formation at the outlet end of a cannula.
The structures that are used to sense pressure may also be used to, for example, sense medicament
cartridge presence and alignment within a pump assembly. In at least some implementations, one portion
of the pressure sensor may be part of the medicament cartridge and another portion of the pressure sensor
may be part of the pump assembly. With respect to the medicament cartridge pressure sensor portions, a
variety of different embodiments are described in Section III above with reference to FIGS. 3-8. Also,
although the term "pressure sensor" is employed because pressure tends to increase when fluid is
pumped into a lumen that is completely or partially occluded, the sensor may simply be a device that
responds to a predetermined threshold pressure or a predetermined increase in volume within a particular
region, as opposed to a sensor that is capable of measuring various pressures within a range of pressures.
Also, actual pressure need not be determined. For example, for a sensor that is calibrated to produce a
predetermined range of outputs over a predetermined range of pressures, the rate of pressure change
(which may be indicative of an occlusion) may be determined without actual pressure determinations.
         Referring now to FIGS. 41 and 42, the exemplary pressure sensor 234 includes the cartridge
portion 120a, which is associated with medicament cartridge 100a described in Section III above, and the
pump assembly portion 236. The cartridge portion 120a may include, among other things, a detectable
structure 124a with a magnet 132a that is carried by a resilient diaphragm 134a. The diaphragm 134a,
which is exposed to reservoir pressure by way of the aperture 128, flexes in response to pressure
increases, thereby resulting in movement of the magnet 132a. The pump assembly portion 236, whose
location is fixed relative to the medicament cartridge 100a, may be a sensor that responds to changes in
the adjacent magnetic field (e.g., a Hall-effect sensor or a magnetoresistive sensor). As the magnet 132a
moves relative to the pump assembly portion 236, the sensor responds to the associated changes in the
adjacent magnetic field (e.g., with a change in output voltage or a change in resistivity). The pump
assembly portion 236 is operably connected to the controller 240, and the controller may be configured
to equate sensor responses to changes in pressure within the through-bore 116. To that end, the pump
assembly portion 236 can be mounted on the circuit board associated with the controller and/or may be
thought of as the powered part of the sensor.
         With respect to operation of the pressure sensor 234, it should initially be noted that a fluid
delivery procedure would be performed with, for example, a cannula connector plug (e.g., plug 602 in
FIG. 57) or a connector plug 550 for an infusion set (FIG. 63) located within the cartridge through-bore
116. Such structures have been omitted from FIGS. 41 and 42 to simplify the illustrations. The detectable

structure 124a is shown in the "at rest" position in FIG. 41, which may correspond to little or no pressure
within the cartridge through-bore 116. The distance between the magnet 132a and the pump assembly
portion 236 is D1. As pressure within the cartridge through-bore 116 increases, deflection of the
diaphragm 134a results in the distance between the magnet 132a and the pump assembly portion 236
decreasing, and the associated sensor will respond accordingly. A pressure change associated with the
missed delivery of six pl of medicament (e.g., 5 psi), which may be considered to be the result of an
occlusion, will decrease the distance between the magnet 132a and the pump assembly portion 236 by an
amount AD to D2 in the illustrated embodiment.
          The discussion here is, of course, equally applicable to the exemplary medicament cartridge 100
(with cartridge portion 120a) described in Section III. Also, as discussed above in the context of FIGS. 3
8, other exemplary detectable structure arrangements include, but are not limited to, a magnetically
permeable structure carried on a diaphragm and movable relative to a coil; and an optical element carried
on a diaphragm and movable relative to an optical sensor; and an electrical conductor carried on a
diaphragm and movable relative to a pair of switch contacts. It should also be noted that, with respect to
the implementations that include a pressure sensor, the present inventions are not limited to pressure
sensor arrangements that include a diaphragm, or to pressure sensor arrangements that include a cartridge
portion and a pump assembly portion. For example, a medicament cartridge may include a pressure
sensor that communicates with the pump assembly by way of electrical contacts.
          Given the very short distance that the magnet or other detectable structure travels (e.g., AD =
about 0.1 to 1 mm), changes in the location of the medicament cartridge (e.g., cartridge 100 or 100a)
relative to the pump assembly portion 236 of the sensor 234 may adversely effect the accuracy of the
measurements. Accordingly, in at least some implementations, various structures are provided to position
and hold the medicament cartridge at a predetermined location within the cartridge receiving area 220,
e.g., the spring bias clips 268 and the latches 412 and 412a described above with reference to FIGS. 18,
23-26 and 32-35A. It should also be noted here that the above-described "low system compliance" aspect
of the present pump assemblies contributes to the accuracy of the sensor measurements by maintaining
the intended spatial relationships between the sensor components, such as pressure sensor cartridge
portion 120a, pump assembly portion 236, and the window 287 therebetween (FIG. 41).
          1.      Exemplary Fall-Off Detectors
          The present inventors have determined that one issue associated with any patch pump is that it
may be fully or partially dislodged from the patient's skin (i.e., "falls off") without the patient's
knowledge. Such full or partial dislodgement could bend the cannula or otherwise interfere with
medicament delivery.
          A variety of mechanisms that detect when a patch pump has been dislodged, and provide an
appropriate signal to the system controller (e.g., controller 240), are discussed below with reference to
FIGS. 43-47. The system controller may take various steps, e.g., activation of an alarm and/or stopping
of the motor, in response to a fall-off signal. Although not limited to use with any particular type of patch

pump, the detection mechanisms are described below in the context of patch pump systems that are
otherwise identical to the above-described system 10 (FIGS. 1 and 54) to simplify the explanation.
Similar elements are represented by similar reference numerals. Other exemplary implementations
include, but are not limited to, patch pumps that do not include a baseplate.
          As illustrated for example in FIGS. 43 and 44, an exemplary pump assembly 200a is provided
with a switch-type detector 650 within the housing 202a, and the exemplary baseplate 500a is provided
with a detector aperture 505 that extends through the plate member 506. The exemplary detector 650
may include a switch 652 and a movable switch actuator 654. The switch 652 may be a self-contained
structure that is biased to the open state (FIG. 43) and that closes in response to contact with the switch
actuator (FIG. 44). In other implementations, some or all of the switch may be carried by the associated
switch actuator. The switch actuator 654, which is biased to an extended position (FIG. 44) by a spring
656 or other bias device, may include an abutment 658 that rests on the skin surface S when the baseplate
500a is secured to the skin and the pump assembly 200a is secured to the baseplate (FIG. 43). A detector
aperture 205 is provided on the housing 202a to permit movement of the switch actuator 654. The
abutment 658 is carried on one end of a post 660, and a stop 662 is carried on the other end. The stop 662
both limits travel of the switch actuator 654 and engages the switch 652 during a "fall-off."
          So configured, the actuator 654 will be out of contact with the switch 652 when the baseplate
500a is secured to the skin and the pump assembly 200a is secured to the baseplate (FIG. 43). As the
baseplate 500a separates from the skin surface S due to failure of the adhesive 542 (FIG. 44) or a pulling
force on the baseplate or pump assembly, or the pump assembly 200a separates from the baseplate due to
failure of the connection therebetween, the biasing force of the spring 656 will move the stop 662 toward
the switch 652 until contact is made, the switch is closed, and a signal is sent to the controller.
          The exemplary switch-type detector 650 may be calibrated, by adjusting the distance D that the
switch actuator 654 must travel prior to closing the switch 656, to define the magnitude of the separation
that will trigger a signal to the controller 240 and, in at least some instances, a subsequent patient alert. In
the illustrated implementation, the distance D may about 0.5 to 2.0 mm.
          Another exemplary fall-off detector arrangement is generally represented by reference numeral
650a in FIG. 45. The exemplary detector 650a includes a sensor 664, which is carried within or by the
housing 202b of a pump assembly 200b, and a movable sensed structure 666 that is carried by the
baseplate 500b. The type of sensor will depend upon the type of structure being sensed. In the exemplary
implementation, the sensed structure includes a magnet 668 and, accordingly, the sensor 664 is a sensor
that is configured to sense changes in magnetic fields such as, for example, a Hall-effect sensor or
magnetoresistive sensor. The housing 202b also includes an indentation 207 to accommodate the sensed
structure 666.
          The manner in which the magnet 668 (or other sensed structure) is carried on the baseplate may
vary. As illustrated for example in FIG. 45, the magnet 668 is carried on a post 670 that extends through
a detector aperture 505 in the plate member 506. A seal 672 may be carried on the post 670. A steel disk

674 is carried by the plate member 506. Elastomeric sheets 676 and 678 may be secured to the plate
member 506 to enclose the magnet 668, post 670 and steel disk 674.
          So configured, the sensed structure 666 will be relatively close to the sensor 664 when the
baseplate 500b is secured to the skin and the pump assembly 200b is secured to the baseplate (not
shown). As the baseplate 500b and attached pump assembly 200b separate from the skin surface S due to
failure of the baseplate adhesive (not shown), the magnetic attraction between the magnet 668 and steel
disk 674 will pull the magnet away from the sensor 664. When the distance therebetween increases to
distance D, the magnitude of the change in the magnetic field experienced by the sensor 664 will be such
that a signal is sent to the controller. The sensor 664 will experience a similar change in the adjacent
magnetic field should the pump assembly 200b separate from the baseplate 500b due to failure of the
connection therebetween.
          The exemplary sensor-type detector 650a may be calibrated by adjusting the distance D that the
appropriate portion of the sensed structure 666 (e.g., magnet 668) must travel prior to a signal to the
controller being triggered and, in at least some instances, a patient alert being provided. In the illustrated
implementation, the distance D may be about 0.5 to 2.0 mm.
          Another exemplary detector, which is generally represented by reference numeral 650b in FIG.
46, is in the form of an RF circuit with a transmitting antenna 680, a receiving antenna 682, and an RF
energy source 684. The RF energy source may be powered by the system battery 238. The receiving
antenna 682 is positioned relative to the transmitting antenna 680 such that the amplitude of the RF field
received changes as the baseplate becomes separated from the user's skin surface S, as shown by
waveforms Al and A2. For example, Al may be about twice A2. The received RF field has a greater
amplitude against skin than in air. In response to a decrease in amplitude, the RF circuit sends a signal to
the controller. The transmitting antenna 680 can be mounted in either one of the baseplate and the pump
assembly (not shown), the receiving antenna 682 can mounted in either one of the baseplate and the
pump assembly, and transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna can both be embedded in the
baseplate 500c (as shown). In those instances where the RF energy source is carried by the baseplate,
power may be provided by way of the pump assembly electrical contacts 228 and 230 (FIG. 16) and the
baseplate contacts 228BP and 230 BP (FIG. 66)
          Another exemplary detector, which is generally represented by reference numeral 650c in FIG.
47, is in the form of an electrical circuit having a first electrical terminal 686 and a second electrical
terminal 688, spaced from the first terminal, and carried on baseplate 500c'. The electrical circuit is
completed between the first and second terminals 686 and 688 by the user's skin when the associated
baseplate 500c' is adhered to the skin surface S by the baseplate adhesive, and is broken when the
baseplate becomes separated from the skin. A signal is sent to the controller when the circuit is broken.
In the illustrated embodiment, the first and second terminals 686, 688 may be in the form of electrically
conductive pads carried on the bottom surface of the baseplate 500c'. The "fall-off' signal may be a

voltage signal and the exemplary circuit is configured to convert current of the electrical circuit to the
voltage signal.
         J.       Exemplary Batteries and Battery Rechargers
         The battery that drives the motor may be a rechargeable battery, such as a rechargeable lithium
polymer battery or a rechargeable lithium ion battery. At least some implementations will employ a
rechargeable battery having a fully charged, open circuit voltage of generally 4.2 Volts, or 4.18-4.24
Volts. One advantage of lithium polymer and lithium ion batteries is that they can be recharged quickly
by the patient, have high energy density, and have desirable linear decay that facilitates accurate charge
state indication. Turning to FIG. 49, the exemplary battery 238 may be carried within the pump assembly
housing 202 in a compartment that is separate from the cartridge compartment 246. Additionally,
because the battery 238 is rechargeable and the housing includes external recharging contacts 228 and
230, the exemplary housing 202 does not include a door or a cover to provided access to the battery, and
the exemplary housing may be sealed (i.e., it cannot be opened without damage thereto).
         In at least some instances, the user may seek to recharge the battery 238 when there is
medicament in the cartridge 100. Note that the cartridge 100 will be locked into the pump assembly 200
so long as the plunger pusher 250 is not in the fully retracted position, as is discussed above with
reference to, for example, FIGS. 23-26. So locked, the cartridge 100 and pump assembly 200 will
separate from the "patch pump" baseplate 500 and cannula 600 in the manner illustrated in FIG. 48,
while the baseplate and cannula remain on the skin surface S of the user, when the user pulls the pump
assembly off of the baseplate. Similar separation will occur in the context of an "infusion set" baseplate
501 and a "non-delivery" baseplate 502 (FIG. 1).
         Given the relatively close proximity of the battery 238 to the medicament cartridge 100, heat
from the battery 238 could possibly increase the temperature of the medicament during recharging,
especially during rapid recharging. The medicament temperature may be relevant to certain medicaments
such as insulin, for example, which can be damaged and have its viability become undefined at about
37 0 C. Accordingly, a temperature sensor 239 (e.g., a thermistor or thermocouple) may also be carried
within the pump assembly housing 202 in such a manner that the temperature sensor can sense the
temperature of the medicament in the cartridge 100 (or a temperature that is at least representative
thereof). For example, the temperature sensor 239 may be carried on the circuit board associated with the
exemplary controller 240 (FIG. 18) or on the chassis 244 (FIG. 18). Temperature sensing apparatus, such
as a heat pipe that extends to the reservoir (not shown), may also be included on some cartridge
implementations. The temperature information may be provided to the controller 240, or to another
controller, to modulate the battery recharging process as a function of temperature as is described below.
         One example of a battery recharger, which is generally represented by reference numeral 700 in
FIG. 49, includes recharging circuitry 702 (e.g., a controller and power circuitry) within a housing 704.
The top portion of the recharger housing 704 may be configured in a manner similar to the baseplate 500.
To that end, the top portion of the housing 704 may include a plate 706, a cartridge recess 708, a pair of

opposing connectors 712, a hook 714, and electrical contacts 228R and 230R. In some implementations,
a temperature sensor 739 may be provided at or near the recess 708 to sense the temperature of
medicament in the cartridge 100 during recharging. Power and data connectors 716 and 718 may also be
provided.
         The respective configurations of the pump assembly 200 and battery recharger 700 are such that,
when the pump assembly is placed on the plate 706 with an end wall 212 abutting the hook 714, the
pump assembly recharge contacts 228 and 230 will be electrically connected to the recharger contacts
228R and 230R. Also, when the cartridge 100 is within the pump assembly 200 during the recharging
procedure, the cartridge barrel 102 will nest in the recess 708 to insure proper alignment of the electrical
contacts 228/230 and 228R/230R. The recess 708 may also be configured to accommodate the finger tab
456 associated with the latch 412a (FIG. 32).
         The recharging process may be controlled by circuitry 237 associated with the pump assembly
controller 240, the recharger controller 702, separate circuitry, or some combination thereof, which are
collectively referred to as the "recharge controller." The recharge controller 702 may modulate the
recharging of the battery 238 as a function of the temperature sensed by temperature sensor 239 and/or
temperature sensor 739. For example, and weighing the desire to rapidly recharge the battery 238 against
the desire to avoid medicament damage, the recharge controller may be configured to maintain the
sensed temperature within a temperature range that is above a predetermined threshold and below a
predetermined maximum for the particular medicament. In the exemplary context of insulin and a lithium
polymer battery, the threshold temperature can be 37 0 C (or range from, for example, 36.6-37.4'C) and
the predetermined maximum temperature can range from, for example, 45-50'C.
         It should also be noted that it may be difficult for the battery 238 to provide enough current if the
temperature within the pump housing 202 is low. The temperature sensor 239 may, therefore, be used to
monitor temperature during operation of the pump assembly 200. An alarm may be actuated by the
controller 240 if the temperature is too low.
         Modulation of the recharging process may be accomplished by, for example, selectively
increasing or decreasing the rate at which the battery 238 is recharged (e.g., by controlling current) as a
function of sensed temperature. For example, and referring to FIG. 50, the modulation process may be
designed to perform temperature control in a manner that prevents the sensed temperature from
overshooting the predetermined maximum temperature (Tm x) as shown by the dashed lines. To that end,
as temperature reaches a modulation temperature (TMOD) below the maximum temperature TmAx, the
recharging rate is reduced to keep the temperature at or below the maximum temperature TMAx.
         In at least some implementations, the charge controller may be configured to identify and/or
prevent charging faults, such as battery overcharge that can cause the battery to swell, vent and otherwise
stress other components within the pump assembly.
         It should be noted here that the present pump assemblies and battery rechargers are not limited to
those which make a direct electrical connection through the use of electrical contacts. By way of

example, but not limitation, inductive coupling may be employed. It should also be noted here that at
least some implementations of the present pump assemblies may be configured to accept a replaceable
battery. Such implementations would, however, require a waterproof battery compartment cover.
         K.       Exemplary Alarms
         As noted above with reference to FIG. 18, the exemplary pump assembly 200 may include an
alarm 242 that is carried within the housing 202. The alarm may be audible (e.g., a buzzer), palpable
(e.g., a vibrator), visible (e.g., an LED with a portion that extends through the housing 202) and/or any
combination thereof. A number of conditions may result in alarm activation in the exemplary
embodiments. For example, as discussed in Section IX below, alarm conditions include, but are not
limited to, low or dead battery, occlusion, low or empty reservoir, hardware self-test, firmware error,
absence of a baseplate, device fall-off, battery charge over-temperature, unable to find plunger, and/or
charging faults.
         L.       Exemplary System Controllers
         The exemplary pump assemblies described herein may include a controller that is configured to
perform the various control functions described herein. The controller may also operate/execute
algorithms for periodic safety checks such as memory checksums, hardware verification self tests, and
the like. The present inventions are not limited to any particular type of controller and include those
currently available or yet to be developed. By way of example, but not limitation, such a controller may
be in the form of a microcontroller and stored firmware programs. The microcontroller may include,
among other things, some or all of a microprocessor or other central processing unit (CPU), other digital
and/or analog control circuitry, digital and/or analog communication circuitry, and memory such as static
random access memory (SRAM), flash memory, and synchronous dynamic random access memory
(SDRAM). The controller may employ any suitable control principles including, but not limited to,
proportional, adaptive, neural network, fuzzy logic, and/or proportional integral derivative (PID). The
microcontroller may also support firmware updates through an RF interface.
         One exemplary controller is generally represented by reference numeral 240 in FIG. 18 and is
described here, in the context of various system components that are connected thereto, with reference to
FIG. 51. The exemplary controller 240 may include a microcontroller (labeled I-C in FIG. 51) with a
CPU, flash memory, SRAM, and a built-in RF transceiver. Building the RF circuitry into the controller
decreases the size of the controller by positioning everything on a single chip. One example of a suitable
microcontroller is the Texas Instruments CC2530 microcontroller.
         A pair of oscillator crystals 249 respectively provide clock sources for the RF transceiver and the
microcontroller. A filter capacitor for the microcontroller power supply is shown at 247.
         As discussed above and below, a variety of devices may be operably connected to the controller
240. Referring to FIG. 51, such devices may include the position detector 398 (FIG. 29) that detects
when the plunger pusher 250 is in the fully retracted (or "home") position, the sensor(s) from an encoder
that monitor motor shaft rotation (e.g., sensors 403a and 403b of encoder 396j), and the temperature

sensor 239, which may be a thermistor, creates a variable analog voltage which connects to an analog
ADC input.
         With respect to power, the recharging contacts 228, 230 connect the battery 238 to the battery
recharger 700 (FIG. 49). The charging voltage is distributed by a distribution circuit 243 to the battery
238 and to a voltage regulator 231. A protection circuit 241 is provided for the battery 238, and a
regulator 231 regulates the power delivered to the microcontroller. The recharger controller 237, if
present, may be used to control recharging of the battery 238 in those instances where the battery
recharger 700 does not perform this function. A voltage divider 245 reduces the voltage to be compatible
with the analog input of the microcontroller and allows the microcontroller to read the full range of the
output of the battery 238. To conserve battery power, the divider 245 is only enabled when battery
voltage is being sensed. When the divider 245 is enabled, the voltage at the associated pin is
BatteryVoltage*Rb/(Ra+Rb). Thus, the voltage is a fractional representation of the actual battery voltage
so that the input range of the pin is not exceeded. The analog-to-digital converter input senses this
voltage. The microcontroller's built-in analog-to-digital converter converts the voltage to a digital value
(e.g., a 10 bit digital value).
         In those implementations where a switch-type fall-off detector is employed (e.g., detector 650 in
FIGS. 43 and 44), the input to R4 is a digital input that senses the actuation of associated switch S3. This
input allows the microcontroller to sense the position of the portion of the detector that protrudes through
the housing 202 (e.g. abutment 658) and can be programmed to wake the microcontroller up from an
extremely low power state.
         The alarm 242, which may be audible, palpable and/or visible, has a driver circuit to increase the
current drive to it. A mute switch 1004 may also be provided, e.g., on the pump assembly housing 202, to
mute an audible alarm.
         A sending and receiving antenna 1002 is provided to communicate with, for example, the remote
control 1000. An impedance matching circuit 1003 for the antenna 1002 receives its power from the
transceiver.
         M.        Exemplary Motor Control
         Turning to motor control, and referring to FIG. 51, the motor 358 (e.g., a stepper motor) actuated
by the phases of the motor coils Cl, C2. The phases are energized in the proper sequence to drive the
motor 358 at the desired speed and in the desired direction. The interlock circuit 361 is a simple missing
pulse detector which can be implemented with a re-triggerable monostable multivibrator integrated
circuit such as a 74HC123 CMOS device from NXP Semiconductors. The interlock circuit 361 is
enabled by a pin 365 that continuously toggles from high to low, and software of the microcontroller
causes the pin to toggle. Thus, if the software stops functioning, the pin will not toggle and the motor 358
will be automatically disabled for safety reasons by the interlock circuit 361. More particularly, output
365 enables the motor interlock circuit 361, protecting against over-delivery of medicament due to a
software lockup.

         Pulse width modulating (PWM) circuit 363 is the motor enable output that enables the drivers
DRI, DR2 to the motor 358. Put another way, the PWM circuit 363 modulates energy from the battery
238 applied to motor coils Cl, C2. This pulse width modulated output enables control of the motor
current depending on the programmed torque and the voltage of the battery 238. Circuit 363 operates at a
frequency ten to one hundred times higher than the motor phases, and avoids having to use a regulator
for the motor voltage.
         Drivers DRI, DR2 energize the coils Cl, C2 of the motor 358 and change their polarities.
Assuming the interlock circuit 361 has been enabled and output F is at a logic 1, driver DRI is enabled
with positive drive to coil Cl when output C is a logic 1 and A is a logic 0. Likewise driver DR2 is
enabled with positive drive to coil C2 when output B is a logic 1 and D is a logic 0. Under the same
conditions, driver DRI is enabled with negative drive to coil C1 when output C is a logic 0 and A is a
logic 1. Likewise driver DR2 is enabled with negative drive to coil C2 when output B is a logic 0 and D
is a logic 1. If A=C, driver DRI is disabled. Similarly if B=D, driver DR2 is disabled. If output F is a
logic 0 or if the interlock circuit 361 is disabled, both drivers are disabled regardless of the state of
outputs A-D. The pulse width modulation occurs when output F of PWM circuit 363 pulses at a given
duty cycle. If F pulses at a 75% duty cycle, then the coils will be turned on with the polarity as selected
by A-D, with an effective voltage of 75% of the battery voltage.
         FIG. 51A     is a block diagram that illustrates        the functional    relationships of certain
elements/components shown in FIG. 51 and, in particular, the relationship of the battery charging system
to the other components of the system. The battery charging system, as shown in the lower left in a
dotted line block, includes the battery 238, the battery protection circuit 241, the power connectors 228,
230 and the charge circuit 237. As can be seen in FIG. 51A, one way the battery charging system
connects to the microcontroller is through the voltage divider 245. The motor drivers DRI, DR2 receive
power from the battery and drive the motor 358 whose position is sensed by the position sense encoder
396j. The interlock circuit 361 provides a safety shutoff of the motor drivers DRI, DR2 when there is a
software problem in the microcontroller. Oscillator crystals 249 provide clocking functions for the
microcontroller and RF transceiver. The microcontroller controls the operation of the alarm 242. The
antenna 1002 is connected to the microcontroller by way of the antenna circuit 1003.
         Energy to the motor 358 may be controlled so as to be within a range having a lower limit that
provides sufficient torque to overcome drive line inefficiencies and axial cartridge friction and move the
plunger 106, and an upper limit that is low enough so as to not cause leakage past plunger seals 152. FIG.
52 is a flow chart showing an exemplary low torque motor control procedure. Referring thereto, a
firmware counter with the number of encoder counts required to advance the pusher a distance
corresponding to the desired drug dose is loaded in the controller 240 (Step S001). The motor 358 is
excited (Step S002) and the encoder 396 is monitored (Step S003). If no motor rotation is detected (Step
S004), then the excitation current is up-regulated to increase the motor torque (Step S005) and the

process is returned to the previously-mentioned motor excitation step (Step S002). On the other hand, if
motor rotation is detected, the counter is decremented (Step S006).
         If the counter is not zero (Step S007), then the excitation current is down-regulated to limit the
motor torque and to conserve energy (Step S008), and the process is returned to the previously
mentioned motor excitation step (Step S002). If the counter is zero (Step S007), then motor excitation is
continued for additional motor steps past the firmware count zero for subsequent detection of motor
rotation following cessation of motor excitation (Step S009). Following completion of the additional
motor steps, delivery is thereby at an end (Step SO10).
         The excitation current regulation method mentioned in the up-regulate and down-regulate steps
above varies with the method used. Examples of methods are (a) pulse width modulation and (b) a
programmable linear or switching type voltage regulator. Up and down regulation using a voltage
regulator increases or reduces the voltage output to the coil drivers. For a pulse width modulation
method, down regulation reduces the duty cycle and up regulation increases the duty cycle.
         In other words, pulse width modulation is one way to control energy consumption and provide a
prescribed (e.g., 10 pound) stall limit. A stall limit that is too low will not provide sufficient performance
against drive line and cartridge inefficiencies, while a stall limit that is too high can overdrive the
cartridge and, potentially, create excessive reservoir pressure that will cause leakage past the cartridge
seals 152 during a pusher "zeroing" procedure (described in Section VIII-B with reference to FIG. 91) or
during an occlusive event (described in Section VIII-C with reference to FIGS. 92 and 93).
         Pursuant to an exemplary embodiment the motor 358 always runs under pulse width modulation
or other torque control method, as the motor is designed with excess torque that needs to be controlled.
Pulse width modulation is one effective method to control the torque. The electronic drive provided for
the motor is important to minimize battery drain as well as to control the torque the motor is providing to
the system and what forces the lead screw 360 is putting on the cartridge 100 in all cases, e.g., retracting,
homing, zeroing, running, and occlusion detecting.
         Referring to FIG. 52A, one of the drivers DRI, DR2 in FIG. 51 is shown connected to the
associated motor winding. Rs is a current sensing resistor (about 1 Q) for implementations that directly
sense the coil current, and Vs is the current sensing voltage. The inductor (L) is the inductance of the
motor winding and the load (R) is the winding resistance. The switch 359c is a FET driver, and diodes
359a and 359b are intrinsic back-diodes within the FET drivers. These components essentially form the
elements of a basic buck-type switching regulator, with R being the load. When the ENABLE bar shown
in that figure (and in FIG. 51) is a logic 0 (the true condition), the switch 359c turns on and power is
thereby provided to the rest of the circuit, thereby enabling the coil drivers. If the switch 359c is turned
on and off at a rate faster than R/L, then the voltage to the load R will be effectively reduced in the
manner of a buck-type switching regulator. During the on time of switch 359c, inductor L charges by
ramping up its current, thereby limiting the voltage applied to load R. During the off time of switch 359c,
the inductor L discharges by ramping down its current, thereby continuing to supply voltage to load R.

Inductor L discharges through the load R and the intrinsic back-diodes 359a and 359b. This circuit could
be further enhanced by adding Schottky diodes across the intrinsic back-diodes 359a and 359b to reduce
the voltage drop when the inductor L discharges through them during the off time of switch 359c. This is
much in the same manner that Schottky diodes are found in buck-type switching regulators.
          The equation to be relied on is: Veff = D * Vbatt, where Veff is the effective voltage to the coil
resistance R, D is the pulse-width modulation duty cycle, and Vbatt is the battery voltage. If the battery
238 is fully charged to 4.0 volts and the motor 358 is to be run as though the battery voltage were only
3.0 volts, pulse-width modulation is done at a 75% duty cycle. The effective voltage to the coil resistance
R is 0.75 * 4.0 = 3.0 volts. As the battery voltage drops to 3.0 volts the duty cycle will be increased to
100% and no switching will take place. The frequency of the switching will be determined by the L/R
time constant. For an exemplary motor L= 3.5 mH-I and R = 30 Ohm, so L/R = 117 pSec. The frequency
has a period less than the time constant to insure a relatively linear ramp-up and down of the inductor
current. This ensures that the equation Veff = D * Vbatt holds true. This method can be used to further
reduce the effective voltage to the coil resistance if desired. This can be done to limit the pressure within
the reservoir. A filter capacitor across the load R used in a traditional buck type switching regulator is not
necessary due to conservation of energy. It simply holds charge to reduce voltage ripple, while the motor
actually operates on electrical current, not voltage. In the description above, the coil current is directly
proportional to the effective voltage Veff, since this voltage is considered to be across the purely resistive
portion R of the coil load. Thus, for example, if the effective voltage to R is reduced by 25%, the current
will also be reduced by 25%.
          The pulse width modulation system may include an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter which
converts voltage of the battery to a digital representation. The controller (a) operates through a driver
circuit to control the operation of the motor and to pulse-width modulate energy from the battery applied
to coils of the motor, (b) reads the digital output of the encoder and (c) reads the digital output of the A/D
converter.
          The controller 240 may include a first software algorithm adapted to use the digital
representation of the motor position to program a first digital timer/counter circuit in the controller to
provide low level signal outputs that enable the drivers DRi, DR2 of the motor 358 to facilitate a
sequencing of voltage at the coils C1, C2 of the motor to produce a desired motor rotation. The controller
240 may also include a second software algorithm that uses the output of the A/D converter to program a
second digital timer/counter circuit in the controller to provide a low level signal output that further
enables the drivers DRi, DR2 of the motor 358 to facilitate the pulse-width modulation of the voltage to
the coils Cl, C2 of the motor 358.
          The steps of the first software algorithm may be as follows: (1) determine the position of the
motor shaft by reading the encoder 396; (2) determine the direction of rotation (either forward/delivery
or reverse/retraction); (3) determine the number of rotations required (how much drug delivery or how
far to retract); (4) step the motor 358 according to the sequence defined by the motor manufacturer's

specification by driving coil phase A and B either + or -; and (5) repeat step (4) at a rate, which
is determined by analysis and characterization during development, that guarantees movement with
normal loads until the desired number of rotations is read from the encoder 396. Steps (4) and (5) may be
performed by the first digital timer/counter circuit where the outputs are connected to the drivers DR1,
DR2 for the motor coils C1, C2 while the microcontroller is reading the outputs of the encoder 396.
          The steps of the second software algorithm may be as follows: (1) determine the effective motor
coil voltage (Veff) required (for example, 2.7 volts to run the motor 358 in the forward direction, 1.1
volts to run the motor in the reverse direction; the actual voltages will be determined after analysis and
characterization    during development); (2) read the A/D         converter output containing the digital
representation of the battery voltage (Vbatt); (3) calculate Veff/Vbatt; and (4) program the second digital
counter/timer circuit to output a digital pulse waveform with a duty cycle of Veff/Vbatt at a frequency of
10 to 100 times the rate of step (5) of the first software algorithm. The output of the second digital timer
circuit will be a global enabling signal for both motor coil drivers DRI, DR2.
          Thus, even though the circuit determines, for example, that at a particular time, coil phase A
should be driven at +Vbatt and coil phase B should be driven at - Vbatt, the output of the second timer is
the gating signal that determines when the drivers are actually enabled to drive the selected levels to the
coils. The result will be that coil phase A will be driven at +Vbatt, but on and off at a duty cycle of
Veff/Vbatt and likewise for coil phase B. This on and off rate will be much higher than the rate that the
drivers DRI, DR2 will switch the polarity of the coil phases to perform the specified sequencing that
causes the motor 358 to rotate. The effect is to limit the current to Veff/Vbatt times the amount of current
that would be used if the full battery voltage were applied to the coils 100% of the rotation time.
          Thus, torque can be limited by limiting the current to the motor coils C1, C2. Other ways to limit
the current are to use a constant current source. However, this can be somewhat complex and wasteful of
battery energy. A constant voltage source can be used. Since the coil resistance limits the current,
limiting the voltage will effectively limit the current. This can be done in either of two ways. A linear
voltage regulator may be employed, although this may be an unnecessary drain on the battery.
Alternatively, a switching voltage regulator may be employed, which is more efficient in that it uses a
coil to store energy, but includes more parts.
V.        EXEMPLARY BASEPLATES AND CANNULAS
          As noted above, and as illustrated for example in FIG. 1, the present infusion systems may
include any one of a variety of different baseplates in combination with a cartridge (e.g., cartridge 100)
and a pump assembly (e.g., pump assembly 200). Each baseplate may be configured for a different mode
of system operation. Baseplate 500 is a body adherable baseplate that may be used in conjunction with a
cannula such as cannula 600 (FIGS. 56-57) which is directly connected to the cartridge 100 so that the
system may be deployed as a "patch pump." Baseplate 501 is configured to connect the cartridge 100 to
an infusion set 503 so that the system may be deployed as a "pocket pump," a "belt-worn pump" or some
other wearable pump. Baseplate 502 is a medicament non-delivery baseplate that includes a plug 504

which may be used to seal the cartridge 100 during periods of non-use. Additionally, and as discussed in
Section VI below, pump assemblies (e.g., pump assembly 200) and baseplates (e.g., baseplates 500-502)
may be respectively configured such that a pump assembly can determine which one of a variety of
baseplates is attached to the pump assembly and then prepare to proceed in accordance with the
operational mode associated with that baseplate. Also, although the exemplary baseplates are described
herein in the context of the exemplary cartridge 100 and the exemplary pump assembly 200, the present
baseplates may be used in conjunction with other cartridges, cartridge-based pumps, and pumps that are
not cartridge-based.
         Turning to FIGS. 53-55, the exemplary body adherable baseplate 500 may include a plate
member 506 that is configured to cover the insertion opening 218 (FIG. 16) in the housing bottom
portion 208. A cartridge aperture 508 (or simply a recess) may be provided to accommodate a
medicament cartridge such as cartridge 100, or may be omitted, and a cannula aperture 510 may be
provided to permit passage of a cannula in those instances where the plate member 506 would otherwise
block the cannula. It should also be noted that the cartridge 100, pump assembly 200 and baseplate 500
are respectively configured such that a portion of the cartridge manifold 108 will rest on the plate
member 506.
         The exemplary baseplate 500 also includes structure that perform the function of securing the
baseplate to the associated pump assembly. For example, in the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 53-55,
the baseplate 500 includes a pair of opposing connectors 512 and a hook 514. The connectors 512
frictionally engage the side walls 210 of the pump assembly housing 202, and may have an engagement
portion 516, a support portion 518 that connects the engagement portion to the plate member 506, and a
protrusion 520 to engage the user's finger. Gaps 522, which are located on either side of the support
portion 518, allow the support portion to pivot in the direction shown by arrow P. The distance between
the engagement portions 516 is less than the distance between the outer surfaces of housing side walls
210 when the connectors are in an unstressed state. As such, when the housing 202 and baseplate 500 are
pressed together (FIGS. 54-55), thereby pivoting the connectors 512 out of their unstressed states, the
engagement portions will apply forces F to the housing side walls 210 that are sufficient to provide
enough frictional engagement to prevent separation during normal usage. The hook 514 may include an
engagement portion 526 and a support portion 524, and gaps 528 may be located on either side of the
support portion 524 if hook flexibility is desired.
         During attachment of the baseplate 500 to the pump assembly 200, a bottom corner of the
housing end wall 212 may be aligned with the space 528 defined by the hook 514. The baseplate 500 and
pump assembly 200 are then moved relative to one another (e.g., pivoted about the hook 214) to the
position illustrated in FIGS. 54-55, where the connectors 512 frictionally engage the housing side walls
210 and secure the baseplate to the pump assembly.
         In at least some embodiments, the baseplate and associated cannula may be configured to secure
themselves to one another. As a result, the pump assembly (e.g., pump assembly 100) and medicament

cartridge (e.g., cartridge 200) may be removed together as unit from the baseplate with the cannula
remaining secured to the baseplate as noted above with reference to FIG. 31. This allows, for example,
the pump assembly battery to be recharged without removing the cartridge. The user may also use this
capability to remove the baseplate and cannula from his/her body and then redeploy the system with a
new baseplate and cannula at a different location.
          One exemplary baseplate and cannula configuration is illustrated in FIGS. 55A-57. The
exemplary baseplate 500" is essentially identical to baseplate 500 and similar elements are represented
by similar reference numerals. In addition, a recess 511 with a mating surface 513 is positioned around
the cannula aperture 510 on the bottom side (i.e., adhesive side) of the plate member 506. The recess 511
is used to secure a cannula to the baseplate 500" in the manner described below.
          The exemplary cannula 600 is configured to establish a fluidic connection between a
medicament cartridge (e.g., cartridge 100) and the patient. The exemplary cannula 600 is also configured
to cooperate with the recess 511 such that axial movement of the cannula relative to the baseplate 501 is
prevented, at least in the removal direction, after the cannula has been deployed into the patient.
          With respect to the fluidic connection, the cannula 600 may include a connector plug 602 (or
"head") that is configured to be inserted into the cartridge through-bore 116. The exemplary connector
plug 602 may include a cylindrical member 604 with an internal lumen 606, at least one inlet port 608
connected to the internal lumen, o-ring or other seals 610 on opposite sides of the inlet port(s) 608. A
cannula tube 612 may be connected to the connector plug 602. The exemplary seals 610 may be integral
with the cylindrical member 604, or may be separate structures formed from rubber or other appropriate
seal materials that are carried thereon.
          Turning to cooperation with the baseplate recess 511, the exemplary cannula 600 includes a latch
(or "hook") 614. Although the latch may be any suitable configuration, the exemplary latch 614 is a
resilient structure that includes a latch surface 616 and a frustoconical support 618 below the latch
surface. The latch 614 will deflect as the cannula 600 is deployed through the medicament cartridge
through-bore 116 in the manner described above with reference to FIGS. 45-49. Here, the inserter trocar
(e.g., trocar 812 in FIG. 85) will push through the top of the cylindrical member 604, through the internal
lumen 606, and through the cannula tube 612, while the inserter drive structure (e.g., movable member
802 in FIG. 85) pushes the top of the cylindrical member. Once the resilient latch 614 passes through the
cannula aperture 510, it will return to its relaxed state and the latch surface 616 will abut the mating
surface 513 in the baseplate recess 511 (FIG. 57). The frustoconical support 618 will then prevent the
cannula 600 from being pulled back through the cannula aperture 510.
          It should also be noted that the respective sizes (e.g., diameters) of the recess 511 and the latch
surface 616 are essentially the same. This relationship produces a tight fit that helps prevent lateral
movement of the baseplate 500" relative to the cannula 600.

          It should also be noted that the configuration of the associated inserter, e.g., inserter 800 in FIG.
85, prevents downward movement of the cannula 600 beyond that illustrated in FIG. 57. In other
implementations, a cannula and/or baseplate may be provided with structure that performs this function.
          The exemplary cannula 600a illustrated in FIGS. 58 and 59 is essentially identical to cannula 600
and similar elements are represented by similar reference numerals. In addition, cannula 600a includes a
septum 620. The septum 620, which is formed from softer material than the cylindrical member 604,
facilitates smooth passage of an inserter trocar to the internal lumen 606.
          The dimensions of the exemplary cannulas 600 and 600a will depend on the intended patient as
well as the configuration of the medicament cartridge. For example, the cylindrical member 604 may
have a diameter of 4 mm +/- 1 mm and a length of 7 mm +/- 1 mm, while the cannula tube 612 may have
an outer diameter of 0.5 mm, an inner diameter of 0.2 mm and a length of 6-10 mm. With respect to
construction and materials, the plug 602 and cannula tube 612 may be formed as two separate pieces (as
shown), and from two different materials, or integrally formed. Suitable materials for an integrally
formed single cannula include, but are not limited to, FEP, PTFE, COP, medical grade plastics, and
polypropylene. In a two piece arrangement, suitable materials for the cylindrical member 604 and
integral resilient latch 614 include, but are not limited to PTFE, COP, medical grade plastics, and
polypropylene, while the cannula tube 612 may be formed from materials such as PTFE, FEP and other
fluoropolymers, and metals such as stainless steel.
          Other exemplary instrumentalities for securing a cannula to a baseplate include, but are not
limited to, other types of latches, including latches where a deflectable structure is included on the
baseplate or both the baseplate and the cannula, as well as devices such as friction devices, adhesive,
pivoting structures and sliding structures. A latching arrangement may also be associated with the
cannula tube instead or, or in addition to, the cannula plug. The cannula latch may also be omitted and
the cartridge through-bore and cannula plug respectively configured such that friction will maintain the
relative positioning. One example of such a latch-less arrangement is discussed below with reference to
FIG. 85.
          The present baseplates and pump assemblies are not limited to any particular connector
arrangement. One alternative is the interlocking latch arrangement illustrated in FIGS. 60 and 61, which
may be employed in any of the pump assemblies and baseplates described herein. The interlocking
arrangement is somewhat similar to the friction arrangement illustrated in FIGS. 53-55 and similar
elements are represented by similar reference numbers. Here, however, the connection involves a
mechanical interlock instead of mere friction. More specifically, the body adherable baseplate 500"'
includes a pair of opposing connectors 512a (one shown) and a hook 514 (not shown). The exemplary
connectors 512a have the aforementioned protrusions 520 as well as apertures 530. The side walls (one
shown) of the associated pump assembly housing 202' have corresponding mating structures 532, each
having a protrusion 534 that is sized and shaped to fit into an aperture 530. In the illustrated
implementation, the mating structures 532 are carried within recesses 536 and have cam surfaces 538 and

flat surfaces 540. As the baseplate 500"' is connected to the pump assembly 200', which is otherwise
identical to pump assembly 200, the protrusions 520 will engage the cam surfaces 538, thereby pivoting
the connectors 512a, until the apertures 530 are aligned with the mating structures 532. The resilience of
the opposing connectors 512a will then cause them to move into the recess 536 and produce the
mechanical interlock (or latched state) with protrusions 534. It should also be noted that the arrangements
illustrated in FIGS. 53-55, 60 and 61 can be reversed, i.e., the connector structures on the housing moved
to the baseplate and connector structures on the baseplate moved to the housing, and/or the connector
structures can be associated with different housing walls. The number of connectors may also be
increased and decreased, and other latching arrangements may be employed.
          The present baseplates and pump assemblies are not limited to the exemplary structures for
securing the baseplate to the associated pump assembly described above. Other suitable structures for
securing a baseplate to a pump assembly include, but are not limited to, guided slide attachments,
mechanical fasteners, magnet arrangements, hook-and-loop attachments, screw-on configurations, and
low tack pressure sensitive adhesives. Also, the pump assembly or the baseplate may be provided with a
pocket into which the other may be inserted.
          The body adherable baseplate 500 will be, before, during and/or after the cartridge 100 and pump
assembly 200 are combined therewith, adhered to the patient's skin. To that end, the bottom surface of
the plate member 506 carries an adhesive layer 542 (FIG. 55) that releasably attaches the baseplate 500
to the patient's skin. The adhesive layer 542 may cover all, or less than all, of the bottom surface. A
removable liner 544 (FIG. 54) may be used to cover the adhesive layer 542 until the time of use.
          The present inventors have determined that it can be difficult to keep the cannula fixed and erect
in the wound, given that the skin may be rough and non-planar and the wound area may be soft, wet and
flexible, and that the failure to keep the cannula fixed and erect in the wound may cause the cannula to
bend and occlude. Strong adhesive close to the cannula keeps the cannula fixed and tight. However,
strong adhesive is more likely to irritate and even damage the skin. Thus, although the adhesive layer 542
may consist of a single type of adhesive, the exemplary baseplate 500 may include more than one type of
adhesive in the adhesive layer 542, each serving a different purpose. In the illustrated embodiment, the
adhesive layer has a first adhesive 546 and a second adhesive 548 that is stronger (or "more aggressive")
than the first adhesive. The first adhesive 546 occupies the majority of the adhesive layer 542 and holds
the majority of the baseplate to the skin with enough strength to prevent separation during normal usage.
The second, more aggressive adhesive 548 surrounds the cannula opening 510 and keeps the cannula
fixed and tight.
          In the illustrated example, the second adhesive 546 may cover 0.75-1.25 mm around the cannula
opening 510, bulging out and intersecting the adjacent corner of the plate member 506. The second
adhesive may also cover 1-10% of the bottom surface. With respect to the relative strengths, in one
example, the peel strength of the first adhesive 544 may be 60 oz/inch width +/- 20 oz/inch width, and

the peel strength of the second adhesive may be 50-100% more than that of the first. In another example,
the first adhesive can have 80% of the strength of the stronger second adhesive.
          The dimensions of the baseplate 500 may correspond to those of the associated pump assembly.
In the context of the exemplary pump assembly 200 described above, the plate member may be 1 mm
thick, with length/width relationships such as 42 mm x 34 mm, 40 mm x 32 mm, and/or 39.0-43.0 mm x
31.0-35.0 mm.
          The exemplary infusion set baseplate 501 illustrated in FIGS. 62 and 63 is substantially similar
to the body adherable baseplate 500 and similar elements are represented by similar reference numerals.
For example, the baseplate 501 may include a plate member 506', a cartridge aperture 508 (or recess),
and connectors 512 (or any of the other connector structures described above). Here, however, the
baseplate 501 may include an infusion set such as infusion set 503 (as shown) or may simply be
configured to be connected to an infusion set. The baseplate 501 may also lack the adhesive layer.
          The baseplate 501 in the illustrated example includes structures that establish a fluidic
connection which extends from the medicament cartridge, such as cartridge 100, to the infusion set 503.
To that end, and referring to FIGS. 62 and 63 the baseplate 501 may have a connector plug 550 that is
configured to be inserted into the cartridge through-bore 116. The exemplary connector plug 550
includes a cylindrical member 552 with an internal lumen 554, a plurality of inlet ports 556 located
around the perimeter of the cylindrical member and connected to the internal lumen, and o-ring or other
seals 558 on opposite sides of the inlet ports 556. The exemplary connector plug 550 may be integral
with the plate member 506' or may be a separate structure that is secured thereto. The exemplary seals
558 may be integral with the cylindrical member 552 or may be separate structures, formed from rubber
or other appropriate seal materials, that are carried thereon. A lumen 560 within the plate member 506'
extends to an outlet port 562.
          The baseplate 501, pump assembly (e.g., pump assembly 200) and cartridge (e.g., cartridge 100)
may be respectively configured such that, when the system 11 is assembled, the connector plug 550 will
be located within the cartridge through-bore 116 with the connector plug seals 558 on opposite sides of
the reservoir outlet port 118. Fluid flowing into the through-bore 116 from the outlet port 118 will enter
the inlet ports 556, flow through the internal lumen 554, the baseplate lumen 560, and the outlet port 562
to the infusion set 503.
          The exemplary infusion set 503 (FIG. 62), which may be any conventional infusion set, may
have a hub 564, a cannula 566 extending from the hub, a flexible adhesive-backed wing-type base 568,
and a fluid tube 570. Infusion sets with disk-type bases may also be employed. The adhesive may be a
single type of adhesive, or may be two or more different adhesives as described above. The tube 570 may
be removably or permanently connected to the outlet port 562. The tube 570 may also be any suitable
length (e.g., 42 inches). Connectors 572 and 574 may be provided on the hub 564 and fluid tube 570 in
those instances where the hub and fluid tube are separable.

          Turning to the exemplary medicament non-delivery baseplate 502 illustrated in FIGS. 64 and 65,
there may be instances where the user chooses not to use the pump assembly to deliver medicament and
desires to re-plug the medicament cartridge to prevent leakage. Such periods of non-delivery may be
associated with, for example, the use of an alternate pump or syringes to deliver medicament, or the
shipment of the pump assembly to a service center.
          The medicament non-delivery baseplate 502 illustrated in FIGS. 64 and 65 is substantially
similar to the body adherable baseplate 500 and similar elements are represented by similar reference
numerals. Given the small sizes of the cartridge 100 and pump assembly 200, users may find it easier to
reseal the cartridge with the medicament non-delivery baseplate 502 than with the plug 110.
          The exemplary baseplate 502 may include a plate member 506, a cartridge aperture 508 (or
recess), and connectors 512 (or any of the other connector structures described above). Here, however,
the baseplate 502 may also include a plug 504 that is configured to prevent flow from a medicament
cartridge (e.g., cartridge 100) carried in a pump assembly (e.g., assembly 100). The baseplate 502 may
also lack the adhesive layer.
          The exemplary plug 504 includes a cylindrical member 578 and two or more o-ring or other seals
580. The exemplary plug 504 may be integral with the plate member 506 or may be a separate structure
that is secured thereto. The exemplary seals 580 may be integral with the cylindrical member 578 or may
be separate structures, formed from rubber or other appropriate seal materials, that are carried thereon.
The baseplate 502, a pump assembly (e.g., pump assembly 200) and a cartridge (e.g., cartridge 100) may
be respectively configured such that, when the system 12 is assembled, the plug 504 will be located
within the cartridge through-bore 116 with the seals 580 on opposite sides of the reservoir outlet port
118, thereby preventing flow.
          It should also be noted that the present inventions include kits which contain various
combinations of baseplates, at least two of the baseplates being different. Kits may also include such
combinations and, in addition, a pump assembly, and/or a medicament cartridge and/or a cannula. For
example, a kit may include one or more of each of baseplates 500 and 502, a kit may include one or more
of each of baseplates 501 and 502, a kit may include one or more of each of baseplates 500, 501 and 502.
Kits may also include any of the combinations recited in the preceding sentence and, in addition, a pump
assembly, and/or one or more medicament cartridges and/or one or more cannulas. The baseplates in
such kits may also include the detection instrumentalities discussed in Section VI below. The
components the present kits (e.g., combination of various baseplates) may be stored in a common
package, with individual packages for each component if necessary, and provided to the user in the
common package. Other instrumentalities that may be provided in such kits includes, but is not limited
to, inserters that are preloaded with a cannula and cleaning swabs. A recharger may also be provided in a
kit that includes a pump assembly.
VI.       EXEMPLARY BASEPLATE IDENTIFICATION

         It should be noted here that, but for the issue of priming, the dispensing procedures associated
with an infusion system "patch pump" configuration, which may include a pump assembly 200 and a
baseplate 500 (FIG. 53), are substantially the same as the dispensing procedures associated with a
"pocket pump" configuration, which may include a pump assembly 200 and a baseplate 501 (FIGS. 62
63). With a "patch pump" configuration, priming is not necessary because the volume of the associated
cannula will be very small and there is a direct connection between the cannula and the medicament
cartridge (FIG. 50). Priming is, however, required to fill the infusion set tube (e.g., tube 570 in FIGS. 62
63) in a "pocket pump" configuration prior to the onset of medicament delivery. 20-30 pl may be
required to fill the entire infusion set tube and, accordingly, the priming procedure may involve the rapid
delivery of 10-15 lUs of U-500 insulin to the tube. The present inventors have determined that it would
be advantageous to prevent users from initiating a priming procedure when the system is in the "patch
pump" configuration, with a cannula positioned to deliver medicament essentially directly from the
medicament cartridge to the patient, because rapidly delivering 10-15 lUs of insulin to the patient could
adversely effect patient health.
         To prevent such undesirable outcomes, at least some of the present baseplates may be provided
with a baseplate identification device and at least some of the present pump assemblies may be provided
with structure that cooperate with a baseplate identification device in such a manner that the pump
assembly controller can make a "baseplate type" determination. For example, the baseplate identification
devices may be carried by the baseplates and may be detectable by the pump assembly as well as
distinguishable from one another. Once the "baseplate type" determination is made (e.g., baseplate 500
or baseplate 501), the pump assembly will proceed in a manner, or mode of operation, that is appropriate
for the attached baseplate. For example, if the baseplate 500 is detected, the controller will not including
priming as part of the delivery process and, in some implementations, will prevent the user from
manually implementing a priming procedure. If, on the other hand, baseplate 501 is detected, then the
delivery process may include appropriate priming of the infusion set tube.
         A wide variety of baseplate identification instrumentalities and identification methodologies may
be employed, and the present inventions are not limited to any particular instrumentalities and
methodologies. Various illustrative examples of such instrumentalities and identification methodologies
are presented below.
         In the exemplary implementation illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 66-68, the baseplates 500, 501 and
502 respectively have identification devices 582-0, 582-1 and 582-2, each of which includes a pair of
electrical contacts. The electrical contacts are located such that each pair will be aligned with (as well as
contact or be otherwise electrically coupled to) a respective two of the three electrical contacts 228, 230
and 232 associated with the pump assembly (FIG. 16) when a baseplate is secured to the pump assembly.
The electrical contacts 228 and 230 may also be used to recharge the pump assembly battery 238, as is
noted above. For example, baseplate identification device 582-0 may include electrical contact pair
228BP/230BP (FIG. 66) that will align with pump assembly electrical contact pair 228/230, baseplate

identification device 582-1 may include electrical contact pair 230BP/232BP (FIG. 67) that will align
with pump assembly electrical contact pair 230/232, and baseplate identification device 582-2 may
include electrical contact pair 228BP/232BP (FIG. 68) that will align with pump assembly electrical
contact pair 228/232. The electrical contacts in each pair, which may be located in recesses 584, are
electrically coupled to one another by conductors 586. The conductors 586 may be formed from a low
resistance material and may be covered with an appropriate electrical insulator.
         During use, and after a baseplate has been secured to the pump assembly (e.g., pump assembly
200), the pump assembly controller (e.g., controller 240) will cause voltage to be applied across the
pump assembly electrical contacts 228, 230 and 232 and may measure resistance (or another suitable
variable) between contact pairs 228/230, 230/232 and 228/232. The pair that is in contact with two of the
baseplate electrical contacts will have low resistance therebetween, while the other two pairs will have
extremely high (e.g., infinite) resistance therebetween. The pump assembly controller may store
information which indicates that low resistance at contact pair 228/230 is indicative of baseplate 500, low
resistance at contact pair 230/232 is indicative of baseplate 501, and low resistance at contact pair
228/232 is indicative of baseplate 502. The "baseplate type" determination may, therefore, be made by
simply determining which two of the three pump assembly electrical contacts have a low resistance path
therebetween.
         Turning to FIGS. 69-72, the exemplary pump assembly 200d is essentially identical to pump
assembly 200 and the baseplates 500d, 501d and 502d are essentially identical to baseplates 500, 501 and
502, respectively. Similar elements are represented by similar reference numerals. Here, however, the
pump assembly 200d only includes the two recharging-related electrical contacts 228 and 230, and the
baseplates 500d, 501d and 502d respectively include baseplate identification devices 588-0, 588-1 and
588-2 that each have two electrical contacts, i.e., electrical contacts 228BP and 230BP. The electrical
contacts 228BP and 230BP, which will contact or otherwise electrically couple with the contacts 228 and
230 when a baseplate is attached to pump assembly, may be connected by resistors RI, R2 and R3 with
different resistor values. The resistor values may be significantly different to reduce the likelihood of
error. For example RI may be 10 kM, R2 may be 22 kQ, and R3 may be 68 kQ. Also, in the illustrated
implementation, the electrical contacts 228BP and 230BP are carried in recesses 590. Resistor value to
baseplate type correspondence information may be stored by the pump assembly controller. During use,
and after a baseplate has been secured to the pump assembly (e.g., pump assembly 200d), the pump
assembly controller will cause voltage to be applied across the electrical contacts 228 and 230 and the
resistance between the electrical contacts 228BP and 230BP will be measured. The "baseplate type"
determination may be made based on this resistance measurement and a comparison of the measured
value to the stored information.
         The exemplary electrical contacts described above may be formed from materials such as copper
or nickel. Also, although the surfaces of the electrical contacts are generally planar in the illustrated
embodiments, the electrical contacts are not limited to any particular configuration. For example,

opposing metallic half balls may be employed with proper accommodation on the pump assembly and
baseplate.
         Other exemplary baseplate identification instrumentalities are illustrated in FIGS. 73-75. Here,
the baseplates 500e, 50 1e and 502e, which are otherwise identical to baseplates 500, 501 and 502,
respectively, carry baseplate identification devices 591-0, 591-1 and 591-2 with different patterns of
optically identifiable targets. For example, the optically identifiable targets may be reflective targets 592a
and occluded targets 592b. The associated pump assembly (e.g., pump assembly 200d) may be provided
with an emitter/detector 593 that "reads" the patterns of optically identifiable targets and transmits a
pattern signal to the pump assembly controller (e.g., controller 240) indicative of the pattern that has
been read (e.g., 0,1,1 for the pattern illustrated in FIG. 74). Pattern to "baseplate type" correspondence
information may be stored by the pump assembly controller, and the controller may identify the baseplate
based on the pattern signal. Additionally, the baseplate identification devices 591-0, 591-1 and 591-2
may be carried or formed directly on the baseplate, or may be carried on structures (e.g. decals) that are
secured to the baseplate.
         Other exemplary baseplate identification instrumentalities are illustrated in FIG. 76. Here, the
baseplates 500f, 501f and 502f, which are otherwise identical to baseplates 500, 501 and 502,
respectively, carry baseplate identification devices 594-0, 594-1 and 594-2 in the form of resonant
circuits with different resonant frequencies. The associated pump assembly (e.g., pump assembly 200d)
may be provided with an RF transmitter 595, including an RF transmitter antenna, a detector
demodulator, and RF electronics. The RF transmitter 595 may be used to detect the frequency of a
resonant circuit in proximity thereto and to provide such frequency information to the controller.
Exemplary resonant frequencies for the baseplate identification devices 594-0, 594-1 and 594-2 include,
but are not limited to, 10 kHz, 20 kHz and 30 kHz, and frequency to "baseplate type" correspondence
information may be stored by the controller.
         Still other exemplary baseplate identification instrumentalities are illustrated in FIG. 77. Here,
the baseplates 500g, 50 1g and 502g, which are otherwise identical to baseplates 500, 501 and 502,
respectively, carry baseplate identification devices 596-0, 596-1 and 596-2 in the form of magnets that
create different magnetic fields. The associated pump assembly (e.g., pump assembly 200d) may be
provided with a sensor 597, such as a Hall-effect sensor or a magnetoresistive sensor, that reads the
magnetic field of the associated baseplate identification device, and sends a signal corresponding to the
sensed magnetic field to the controller. Magnetic field to "baseplate type" correspondence information
may be stored by the controller.
         Turning to FIG. 78, the exemplary baseplate identification instrumentalities illustrated therein
include baseplate identification devices 598-0, 598-1 and 598-2 in the form of RFID tags, each of which
emits different identification data in response to being interrogated. The baseplate identification devices
598-0, 598-1 and 598-2 are respectively carried by baseplates 500h, 501h and 502h, which are otherwise
identical to baseplates 500, 501 and 502. The associated pump assembly (e.g., pump assembly 200d) may

be provided with an RFID reader 599 that interrogates the associated identification device, and sends a
signal corresponding to the identification data to the controller.
         The present baseplates and pump assemblies are not limited to the exemplary identification
instrumentalities described above. By way of example, but not limitation, other identification
instrumentalities include protrusions on the plate that depress buttons, or combinations of buttons, on the
bottom surface of the pump assembly housing. Another example includes depressible pins that extend
from the bottom surface of the pump assembly housing, such that they will be pressed by an attached
baseplate. Here, different baseplates may be provided with different combinations of indentations that
will be aligned with the pins, to prevent depression thereof, when the baseplate is attached. It should also
be noted that the present baseplates and pump assemblies are not limited to identification
instrumentalities that require the baseplate to be completely or partially attached to the pump assembly
prior to the identification procedure. Instrumentalities that merely require suitable proximity (including
those that involve RFID technology) may be employed.
VII.     EXEMPLARY BASIC OPERATION AND USE
         At the most basic level, use of the exemplary infusion pump system 10 (or 11) illustrated in FIG.
1 involves inserting a new medicament cartridge 100 into the pump assembly, connecting the baseplate
500 (or 501) to the pump assembly, gaining subcutaneous access, and initiating a medicament delivery
operation. In some instances, use may involve additional steps such as removal of a previously inserted
cartridge (whether empty or not) and battery recharging. Various aspects of the basic operation of the
present systems are described below. Operation of a system does not require all of the steps each time the
system is deployed, and the order of some of the steps may be changed. Operation is also discussed
below, in the exemplary context of the above-described cartridge 100, pump assembly 200' and patch
pump baseplate 500', through the use of a flow chart (FIG. 79) as well as through illustrations of the
exemplary system itself in various states (FIGS. 80-90). The discussion is, however, equally applicable to
other patch pump implementations, as well as to pocket pump implementations with minor variations.
Also, unless otherwise indicated, the actions and determinations performed by the pump assembly 200'
are controlled by controller 240 (FIGS. 18 and 84) and references to the controller are omitted in the
interest of brevity.
         Referring first to FIG. 79, use of the present systems may involve removal of a cartridge from a
pump assembly. This may occur (in some instances automatically) when the plunger pusher 250' is at the
end of the pusher stroke (Step S 101) and a "replace cartridge" report is presented (Step S 102), or when
the controller receives a user-initiated "replace cartridge" signal from the remote control 1000 (Step
S 103). The user may desire to replace a cartridge before it is empty for a variety of reasons such as, for
example, to accommodate the user's sleep or travel schedule, when the medicament appears cloudy or
otherwise exhibits a loss of effectiveness, when a dispensing problem arises, or due to a prescribed
change in medicament. Whether automatic or user-initiated, the plunger will be returned to the fully
retracted home position (Step S 104). The user may then obtain a new cartridge 100, a new baseplate

500', a new cannula and inserter, the remote control 1000 (if not already at hand), and the battery
recharger 700 (Step S 105). The cartridge 100, pump assembly 200', baseplate 500' and cannula may then
be removed from the skin, and the baseplate, cartridge and cannula discarded (Steps S106 and S 107).
The battery 238 may be recharged with the recharger 700 (Step S108) in the manner described in Section
IV-J above with reference to FIGS. 49-50.
          A new cartridge 100 may then be inserted in the pump assembly 200' (Step S 109). In particular,
as illustrated in FIG. 80, because the pusher 250' is in a retracted home position, the slidable latch 412a
is unlocked and the latch member 442 can be pushed to the rearward position, thereby facilitating
cartridge insertion, as described in Section IV-F above with reference to FIGS. 32-35A. The latch
member 442 will return to the locked position (FIG. 81) when released, thereby pushing the cartridge 100
against the chassis 244.
          The plug 110 may remain in the cartridge through-bore 116 should the user desire to perform the
pusher zeroing procedure (or "zeroing procedure") described in Section VIII-B below with reference to
FIG. 91 (Step S110). The zeroing procedure may also be an automatic aspect of pump operation. The
user may use, for example, the remote control 1000 to initiate the zeroing procedure (FIG. 81) which
involves briefly advancing the pusher 250' (FIG. 82), thereby locking the latch 412a and rigidly fixing
the position of the cartridge 100 against the chassis 244 in a held position within the cartridge receiving
area 220. If the results of the zeroing procedure are negative, the pusher 250' is withdrawn (FIG. 83),
thereby unlocking the latch 412a. The medicament cartridge 100 is removed and discarded, a new
cartridge is inserted, and the zeroing procedure is repeated (Steps S111, S112, S113 and S114).
Alternatively, if the results of the zeroing procedure are positive, the pusher 250' is withdrawn, the plug
110 is removed and the baseplate 500' may be secured to the pump assembly 200', as shown in FIG. 84
(Steps S 115 and S116). As discussed above in Section IV-F above with reference to FIG. 35A, the
slidable latch member 442 will seat in the baseplate latch indentation 509 to properly align the pump
assembly 200' and baseplate 500'.
          A cannula inserter (or "inserter") may then be secured to the pump assembly 200' (Step S 117).
One exemplary inserter, which is generally represented by reference numeral 800 in FIG. 85, may
include a movable member 802 within a housing 804, and a trigger-type actuator 806 that acts on the
movable member. The exemplary actuator 806 may have a rotatable trigger 808 and a compressed spring
or other biasing device 810. A trocar 812 is carried on the movable member 802. A cannula 600' is pre
mounted on the trocar 812 such that the sharp end of the trocar extends beyond the cannula tube 612. The
inserter 800 may also be configured to withdraw the trocar back into the housing 804 after the cannula is
deployed.
          It should be noted here that the exemplary cannula 600' is substantially similar to the cannula
600 described in Section V above with reference to FIGS. 56-57 and similar elements are represented by
similar reference numerals. Here, however, the cannula 600' does not include a latch. Instead, the
respective configurations (e.g., shape, size and materials) of the cartridge through-bore 116 and the

cannula plug 602' are such that friction therebetween will maintain the relative positioning after cannula
deployment. The cannula plug 602' may also be formed from two different materials, e.g., a more rigid
inner material to provide structural support and a softer outer material for sealing. The discussion
concerning deployment of the cannula 600' is, of course, equally applicable to cannula 600, cannula 600a
and/or any other cannula that may be used in conjunction with the present pump assemblies and
baseplates.
         The user may clean the skin surface S onto which the baseplate 500' will be adhered, and the
liner 544 may be removed to expose the adhesive layer 542, as illustrated in FIGS. 85 and 86 (Steps
S1 18 and S1 19). Turning to FIGS. 87, the unit consisting of the cartridge 100, pump assembly 200',
baseplate 500', cannula 600' and inserter 800 may be adhered to the skin surface S (Step S 120). The
inserter actuator 806 may then be actuated (FIG. 88) by rotating the trigger 808, thereby allowing the
spring 810 to drive the movable member 802 towards the patient (Step S121). The cannula plug 602' will
be properly seated in the cartridge through-bore 116, and the cannula tube 612 will be subcutaneously
deployed, at the end of the movable member stroke. The inserter 800 may then be removed (FIG. 89,
Step S122).
         In some implementations, the pump assembly may be provided with structure (not shown) that
performs the function of determining whether or not the cannula is properly inserted (Step S 123). If not,
an error message will be provided to the user (Step S 124).
         Finally, as shown in FIG. 90, the remote control 1000 may be used to initiate a particular
medicament delivery operation (Step S 125). The delivery operation may follow a predetermined delivery
profile (e.g. a particular basal rate, a series of time-spaced bolus deliveries, or some combination thereof)
that is equated to motor rotations, at particular rates and times, required to deliver medicament in
accordance with the profile. The profile may be input by the user with the remote control 1000 and stored
by the controller 240. For example, as described below, the remote control may store a number of
different delivery profiles and bolus deliveries from which the patient can choose. Such profiles may
correspond to, for example and depending on the medicament, days where vigorous exercise is expected,
days where it is not, incidences of increased pain, etc. Alternatively, or in addition, the profile stored in
the controller may be set by a clinician's programming unit.
         The discussion above is also applicable to use of the "pocket pump" system 11. Minor variations
in the above-described procedure include, for example, use of the baseplate 501, deploying the infusion
set 503 instead of a cannula, and priming of the infusion set tube.
VIII.    EXEMPLARY OPERATIONAL METHODOLOGIES
         Various methodologies are presented here in the context of the exemplary structures described in
the preceding sections, and illustrated in FIGS. 1-90, for the purpose of explanation only. Although the
present methodologies may employ the structures described above, they are not limited thereto.
Additionally, the alarms, reports and other notifications associated with the methodologies described
below may be provided in audible, visible and/or tactile form. A pump assembly may provide audible,

visible and/or tactile notifications. A remote control may also provide audible, visible and/or tactile
notifications as an alternative to, or in addition to, any notifications provided by a pump assembly.
Additionally, embodiments of the present inventions may incorporate any one of the methodologies
described below, or all of the methodologies described below, or any and all combinations of less than all
of the methodologies described below.
         A.        Exemplary Cartridge Position Check
         Given the relatively small size of the systems described above, the present inventors have
determined that it would be desirable to determine whether or not a cartridge (e.g., cartridge 100) has
been properly inserted into (or "positioned in" or "seated in") a pump assembly (e.g., pump assembly
200) cartridge receiving area. For example, it may be desirable to make such a determination when the
cartridge is initially inserted into a pump assembly, and prior to the pusher zeroing procedure discussed
in Section VIII-B below. Other procedures, such as pusher zeroing procedure, may also start
automatically after the position check.
         A variety of structures may be employed in such a position check. For example, as discussed in
Section IV-H above with reference to FIGS. 41 and 42, an exemplary cartridge and pump assembly may
be provided with a pressure sensor 234 that includes a detectable structure on the cartridge portion 120
(e.g., a magnet) and a detector on the pump assembly portion 236 that responds to the detectable
structure (e.g., a sensor that responds to changes in magnetic fields). The pre-pressurization "at rest"
position of the cartridge portion 120 within the cartridge receiving area 228 (and relative to the chassis
window 287) is also closely controlled by, for example, the spring bias clips 268, the latches 412 and
412a and structures 494 described in Section IV-F above with reference to FIGS. 18, 23-26, 32-35A and
38. As a result, the controller 240 may use the signals from the pump assembly portion 236 to determine
whether or not the cartridge has been properly positioned. In the exemplary context of magnet-based
sensors, the controller would compare the measured magnetic field signals to expected magnetic field
signals to determine whether or not the cartridge is properly positioned.
         Accordingly, and referring to FIG. 91, a method of checking cartridge position may include
sampling the output of the pump assembly portion 236 of a pressure sensor 234 (Step S201) and
determining whether or not the output is above a predetermined threshold and stable (Step S202). If not,
then a "cartridge not installed" alert may be provided (Step S203) so that the user can take appropriate
action, such as inserting a new cartridge or returning the pump to the manufacturer. If the cartridge is
properly positioned, then the system will proceed with subsequent processes such as the pusher zeroing
procedure described below.
         It should also be noted here that in other implementations, structures other than the pressure
sensor 234 may be used to determine whether or not the cartridge 100 is properly positioned in the pump
assembly 200. For example, the cartridge barrel 102 may be provided with a pressure responsive
structure that will not be isolated from the reservoir, as will the sensor cartridge portion 120 by the plug
110, during the pusher zeroing procedure described below. Here, a pressure-based cartridge position

check may be performed at the onset of a pusher zeroing procedure. Switches, electrical contacts or other
devices may also be employed.
          B.      Exemplary Pusher "Zeroing" Procedure
          As discussed at great length above, precision is very important to dispensing procedures that
involve highly concentrated medicaments such as U-500 insulin. The present inventors have determined
that one aspect of dispensing precision is associated with the distance that the plunger pusher must travel,
from the initial home position, before it will engage the cartridge plunger and begin to drive medicament
out of the reservoir. Given that there may be some tolerances associated with cartridge manufacture and
initial seating of the cartridge within the pump assembly, this distance may vary. Thus, a dispensing
process based on an estimate/measurement of this distance at the time of manufacture may result in under
delivery or over delivery in some circumstances.
          The pusher zeroing procedure described below obviates this issue by precisely determining
and/or setting, prior to actual dosing, exactly how far the plunger pusher 250 must travel before it will
engage the cartridge plunger 106. This procedure may be performed each time a cartridge 100 is inserted
into a pump assembly 200 and, in at least some instances, is performed after the position of the cartridge
is checked in the manner described in the preceding section. Generally speaking, the zeroing procedure is
performed when flow from the cartridge 100 is blocked by the plug 110. A test load (e.g., ten pounds) is
applied to the cartridge 100 with the plunger pusher 250 to fully seat the cartridge and to generate a
motor stall. Misalignment or misplacement of the cartridge 100 within the pump assembly 200, such as
from a raised chip or other debris on mating surfaces, is either removed or accommodated by local
deformation of the cartridge under the test load, thereby precluding subsequent cartridge movement
during medicament delivery. The motor stall is presumed to be due to hydraulic lock and, therefore,
indicative of the plunger pusher 250 engaging the plunger 106 of a plugged cartridge 100.
          Referring again to FIGS. 81-83 and 91, one exemplary implementation of the zeroing procedure
may be practiced in conjunction with pump assembly 200'. The zeroing procedure, which is equally
applicable to pump assembly 200, commences by advancing a plunger pusher 250' into engagement with
the cartridge plunger 106 (FIG. 81) to increase the fluid path pressure (Step S204). The encoder 396 or
other monitoring device is sampled to determine whether a motor stall occurs as the pusher 250'
continues to be advanced (Steps S205 and S206). One example of such a stall is illustrated in FIG. 82.
The pusher 250' may be advanced up to a predetermined allotted distance (e.g., 0.5 mm) from the home
position (FIG. 18), which corresponds to a predetermined number of encoder signals. The allotted
distance is a distance that is sufficient to make contact with cartridge plunger 106 under normal
conditions.
          The pusher may be initially advanced at a relatively fast speed, and then advanced at a relatively
slow speed (e.g., 1/2 of the faster speed) until the lack of encoder signals evidences that the motor is not
turning. The faster speed can occur over a distance of 0.3 mm and the slower speed can occur over a
distance of 0.2 mm. The slower speed is a "searching" speed employed over the portion of the allotted

distance where it is anticipated that the pusher 250' will contact the plunger 106. The lower speed
reduces the force of the impact. The faster speed is used to speed up the process over the portion of the
allotted distance where it is less likely that the pusher 250' will contact the plunger 106. Also, the pusher
250' may be advanced at a controlled torque, or limited force, so that the motor will stall with the least
amount of force possible for reliable results, in order to reduce the load on the system (e.g., the bearings
and the battery).
          If a motor stall does not occur within the allotted distance, the system controller 240 may
determine that the associated cartridge 100 is either not new, not full, was improperly made or filled, or
is otherwise defective and may preclude its use (Step S208). In those instances where the cartridge is not
full, the preclusion is useful because, for example, the associated dispensing program may be based on a
full cartridge with a known volume of medicament.
          If the motor 358 does stall within an acceptable encoder count range, i.e., at or before the allotted
distance, then the pusher 250' is retracted a predetermined distance by running the motor in reverse,
which ends the process (Step S209). One example of pusher retraction is illustrated in FIG. 83. The
retraction distance may be, for example, 0.001 to 0.005 inch (0.025 mm to 0.125 mm). The retraction
distance may also be equated to dispensed medicament, e.g., 1 to 20 pl worth, or 5.5 to 6.5 pl worth. In
any event, at the onset of dosing, the distance between the plunger pusher and the plunger is precisely set
and can be taken into account as movement of the plunger pusher is controlled.
          The advancing-retracting process can be repeated a few times to account, for example, for
variability of the interface between the lead screw 360 and nut 364 (FIG. 23). The advancing-retracting
process can be also repeated using a light force (e.g., two pounds) followed by a stronger force (e.g., four
to five pounds) to confirm that the first motor stall was due to torque and not some other cause.
Repeating the process increases the likelihood that the "zero" distance between the plunger pusher 250'
and the dry side of the plunger 106 will be precisely established.
          C.      Exemplary Occlusion Detection
          Various structures in the exemplary cartridges and pump assemblies may be used to detect
occlusions in a cartridge, cannula or infusion set tube. Although precise occlusion detection may be
desirable in any infusion pump, it is especially desirable in those instances where very high concentration
medicament is dispensed. For example, some conventional insulin pumps alert the patient after
approximately 30 pl of missed delivery without an undue number of false alarms. While this level of
fidelity may be adequate in the context of U-100 insulin, where 30 pl equates to 3 lUs of insulin, it
would result in a much more problematic 15 lUs of missed delivery in the U-500 context. Occlusions
may also lead to other undesirable outcomes. For example, continuing to drive the motor in the presence
of an occlusion may lead to cartridge leakage and/or damage to various aspects of the drive mechanism.
The structures described above and methodologies described below address these issues.
          One exemplary dispensing method, which includes occlusion detection, is illustrated in FIGS. 92
and 93. The occlusion detection aspect of the exemplary method includes monitoring of the motor

encoder 396 as well as monitoring of the pressure sensor 234. It should be noted, however, that only one
of the two may be monitored in the occlusion detection context in other implementations.
         Referring first to FIG. 92, at the initiation of a dosing operation, the firmware counter of the
controller 240 is loaded with the number of encoder counts required to advance the pusher 250 a distance
corresponding to the desired drug dose (Step S30 1). For example, in some implementations, a single dose
of 1 pl (or 0.50 IU) of U-500 insulin would equate to 14.4 motor revolutions. In other words, in the
context of the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 23, 14.4 motor revolutions will cause the drive
screw 360 to drive the plunger pusher 250 (and cartridge plunger 106) a distance sufficient to force 1 pl
from the reservoir 104.
         Motor rotation begins, which causes the pusher 250 to advance, and the counter is decremented
in response to signals from the encoder 396 (Step S302). Detected increases in pressure from the pressure
sensor 234 and/or signals from the encoder 396 indicative of a stalled motor 358 result in the generation
of an "occlusion" report (Steps S303, S304 and S305). In at least some implementations, the motor 358
will also be disabled (i.e., motor excitation ceases). Various exemplary occlusion detectors are discussed
in greater detail in Section IV-H above with reference to FIGS. 41 and 42. In response to the detection of
an occlusion, the user may be instructed to remove and replace the cartridge 100 as well as the baseplate
500 (and associated cannula) or baseplate 501. Also, in at least some implementations, the plunger
pusher 250 will be automatically withdrawn from the cartridge and returned to the home position, as
described in Section VIII-F below, in response to a detected occlusion. This readies the system for
cartridge removal and replacement.
         Absent an occlusion, the dispense operation will continue until the counter reaches zero (Step
S306), which indicates that the desired dose has been delivered. At that point, the controller 240 will
control the motor 358 to rotate until the next step count from the encoder 396, and will thereafter disable
the motor (Steps S307 and S308). The controller 240 may, however, continue to monitor the encoder 396
(Step S309) to determine whether or not there is encoder (and motor 358) rotation in the absence of
motor excitation (Step S310). If forward rotation of the motor 358 is detected in the absence of motor
excitation (Step S311), which indicates that the motor 358 is at least attempting to drive the plunger
pusher 250 in the dispensing direction, an error is reported (Step S312). If reverse rotation is detected in
the absence of motor excitation, which is indicative of the plunger pusher moving away from the
cartridge plunger due to, for example, system load or compliance, the appropriate number of encoder
counts will be added to the next dispense dose (Step S313).
         As alluded to above, occlusions may be detected by monitoring rotation of the motor 358 (e.g.,
by way of the encoder 396) and/or by monitoring pressure (e.g., with the sensor 234). With respect to
pressure, a predetermined rate of pressure change (or AP/AT) or pressure above a predetermined
threshold may be indicative of an occlusion. The present methods may employ one of, any two of, or all
three of rotation, AP/AT and threshold, as shown in FIG. 93. Motor rotation may be monitored during a
dispense operation by continuously sampling the encoder 396 with the controller 240 (Step S40 1). If the

encoder 396 does not sense rotation of the motor 358 during a dispense operation, the controller 240 will
consider the motor 358 to be stalled due to, among other things, an occlusion (Step S402) and report
accordingly (Step S403). Alternatively, or in addition, the controller 240 may repeatedly sample the
output of the pressure sensor 234 (Step S404) and use a most recent value, the immediately preceding
value, and the time period therebetween to create AP/AT values (Step S405). If the AP/AT values remain
over a predetermined magnitude (e.g., 2 psi/sec.) for a predetermined period of time (e.g., 2 sec.), the
controller 240 will consider the pressure increase to be due to an occlusion (Step S406) and report
accordingly (Step S403). Alternatively, or in addition, the controller 240 may repeatedly sample the
output of the pressure sensor 234 (Step S407) and compare the output to a predetermined threshold value
(Step S408). In some instances, the controller 240 will provide a "possible occlusion" alert in response to
any sample that is over the threshold value (e.g., the expected "occluded" value) and, regardless of
whether the "possible occlusion" alert is provided, subsequent samples will be used to determine whether
or not the condition persists (Step S409). If the "over the threshold" condition persists for a
predetermined period (e.g., 1 sec.), and if a comparison of subsequent samples to the prior sample is not
indicative of a future reduction below the threshold value, then the controller 240 will consider the
pressure increase to be due to an occlusion (Step S410) and report accordingly (Step S403).
         D.        Exemplary Accounting For Unpowered Motor Reverse
         The present inventors have determined that there may be some instances where an unpowered
motor unintentionally rotates in reverse due to, for example, system load or compliance. Such load and
compliance may be associated with a build-up in force in the gears which releases itself by the gears
turning in the reverse direction when the motor is not energized. When this occurs, the motor is rotated in
reverse. At the other end of the gear assembly, the plunger pusher, which has previously been brought
into engagement with the cartridge plunger, may (or may not) pull away from the plunger. The initial
motor turns in the next delivery procedure (or "dose" or "delivery cycle") will, in essence, simply rebuild
the force in the gears and, if not already the case, bring the pusher back into contact with the plunger. As
a result, the volume of medicament actually delivered to the patient in that dose will be less than
expected.
         In order to account for, or correct for, the delivery error that would otherwise be associated with
this condition, the pump assembly may include an encoder 396 which senses rotations of the motor in
both the forward and reverse directions. The controller 240 may be configured to determine from the
encoder signals the amount of reverse rotation and to adjust the dispensing program accordingly so that
the net result is the overall intended result.
         One example of such a correction process is illustrated in FIG. 94. At the onset of a dispensing
procedure (Step S501), the number of motor revolutions corresponding to the intended delivery is
calculated and set (Step S502). Using the example above, a single dose of 1 pl (or 0.50 IU) of U-500
insulin may equate to 14.4 motor revolutions. The controller 240 will control the motor 358 to operate
for the set number of revolutions (Step S503), unless one of the other alarm conditions described below

with reference to FIG. 100 occurs. The controller 240 will then unpower the motor 358, and the motor
will remain unpowered, until the next dosing (Step S504). Should the motor 358 rotate in reverse, as
evidenced by signals from the associated encoder 396, the number of reverse rotations (or "reverse
count") will be counted and stored until the next dosing (Steps S505 and S506). When the next dosing
commences, the reverse count will be added to calculated and set number of rotations for that next dosing
(Step S503). For example, if there were 2 reverse rotations prior to a dosing that equates to 14.4 motor
revolutions, the controller would control the motor to perform 16.4 revolutions for that dosing.
         E.       Exemplary Motor Stopping
         The present inventors have determined that another aspect of motor control which can effect the
precision of medicament delivery is motor stopping. Briefly, when a controller cuts off power to a motor,
the motor will continue to rotate, in a now uncontrolled state, due to its own momentum and the
momentum of other rotating aspects of the drive mechanism. The plunger pusher will continue to travel
in the forward dispensing direction, thereby driving the cartridge plunger, as the motor continues to
rotate. Although one could simply cut off power a few revolutions prior to the end of a delivery cycle,
the precise number of "extra," post cut-off revolutions is difficult to accurately and consistently estimate.
As such, the simple act of turning the motor on and off, from dose to dose, can lead to under delivery
and/or over delivery error due to the uncontrolled movement of the plunger pusher.
         One exemplary method of controlling a motor such as a stepper motor 358 with a controller such
as controller 240 is graphically illustrated in FIG. 95. In particular, the speed of motor is increased from
zero at the beginning of the dispensing procedure (e.g., a single dose) and is then maintained at a
constant rate. At a predetermined point prior to the end of the dispensing procedure (e.g., three
revolutions prior), which is labeled "begin motor stop process" in FIG. 95, the frequency of the power
waveform delivered to the motor 358 will be slowly decreased. Positive control over the motor 358 is
maintained as the velocity of the plunger pusher 250 decreases from its propelling velocity to a complete
stop, where the speed equals zero and the dosing ends. Maintaining positive control of the motor 358 in
this manner allows the number of turns associated with a motor stoppage to be precisely controlled as is
shown with a solid downwardly sloping line in FIG. 95. As a result, the intended number of rotations
associated with stoppage will be the actual number of rotations, the distance of pusher travel will be the
intended distance, and dispensing precision will be maintained. For purposes of comparison, stopping the
motor by simply cutting off power at the same predetermined point may result in too much or too little
rotation, as is shown with dashed lines. As a result, the distance of plunger travel (and dispensed volume)
may be more or less than intended.
         Accordingly, by employing the above-described stopping method, the controller can cause the
motor 358 to propel the pusher 250 against the medicament reservoir plunger 106 according to a
medicament dispensing program, having a plurality of individual dispensing operations, without
stoppage related losses in precision. Also, the predetermined point prior to the end of the dispensing
procedure at which frequency of the power waveform begins to decrease may vary from system to

system. Although a three revolution slow down period is employed in the illustrated example, that
number may be increased or decreased, and need not be a whole number.
         F.       Exemplary Automatic Plunger Pusher Retraction Procedures
         For purposes of convenience and safety, the present pump assembly may be configured such that
the plunger pusher is automatically retracted out of the associated medicament cartridge to the home
position when the cartridge reaches the empty state, as evidenced by an encoder count or a motor stall,
and/or when there is a motor stall due to an occlusion or other mechanical issue.
         Referring to FIG. 96, the controller 240 will monitor the encoder 396 to determine whether the
motor 358 has stalled or the encoder count has reached the number that is indicative of an empty
cartridge (Step S60 1). Such a stall would be evidenced by the cessation of encoder counts and could, for
example, be the result of the plunger pusher 250 driving the cartridge plunger 106 into the cartridge end
wall 119 (FIG. 25), or an occlusion, or a mechanical issue. The "empty" number could reflect the exact
number of motor rotations that would result in, for example, the cartridge plunger 106 reaching the end
wall 119 (FIG. 3A). However, in order to prevent damage to the drive mechanism that could result from
the plunger pusher 250 repeatedly driving cartridge plungers into a fixed wall, the "empty" number could
instead reflect slightly less than the exact number of motor rotations. It should also be noted that the
encoder count may be adjusted to account for unpowered reverse motor rotations, during the life of the
associated cartridge, in the manner described above with reference to FIG. 94.
         Other issues notwithstanding, so long as the motor 358 has not stalled and the encoder count is
not indicative of an empty cartridge, dispensing will be allowed to continue (Step S602). If, on the other
hand, the motor 358 has stalled or the encoder count is indicative of an empty cartridge, then the
controller 240 will control the motor to run in the reverse, pusher retraction direction (Steps S603 and
S604). The retraction speed may be relatively slow, as compared to a user-initiated retraction, so as to
conserve battery power. For example, a relatively slow retraction may take 1 minute, or between 1.5 and
2.5 minutes, while a faster user-initiated retraction may take 30 seconds, or between 20 and 40 seconds.
The user is not inconvenienced by the slower automatic retraction because it is occurring automatically at
a time when the user is most likely not waiting for it to end, as would be the case in a user-initiated
retraction.
         At least initially, the retraction will take place at the full retraction speed (Step S605). The speed
may be reduced to a slower speed when the pusher 250 approaches the fully retracted home position
(Step S606). For example, the speed may be reduced at a distance from the fully retracted position that
corresponds to 10% of the total pusher travel distance (i.e., the distance between fully retracted and fully
extended). Withdrawal will continue until the controller 240 determines that the pusher has reached the
fully retracted position (e.g., by way of position detector 398 in FIG. 29), at which time the motor 358
will be stopped (Steps S607 and S608). To that end, it should be noted that the lower speed over the last
 10% of pusher travel reduces the likelihood that the pusher 250 will damage the switch 398 or other
position detector during impact therewith.

          G.       Exemplary Gear Assembly Verification Procedure
          One aspect of the present pump assembly 200 that may require periodic operational verification
is the gear assembly (e.g., gear assembly 362 in FIG. 19) and, for example, the interfaces thereof. One
exemplary gear assembly verification procedure ("GAV procedure") is illustrated in FIG. 97. The
exemplary GAV procedure will typically be performed by a controller when there is no medicament
cartridge in a pump assembly in order to avoid the possibility of medicament being unintentionally
dispensed. For example, controller may be configured to perform the GAV procedure each time the
plunger pusher is returned to the fully retraced home position (e.g., against a hard stop), which is
commonly associated with cartridge removal, or during a pusher zeroing procedure. Alternatively, or in
addition, the GAV procedure may be a user implementable procedure initiated through operation of the
remote control 1000.
          Upon initiation of the GAV procedure (Step S701), the controller 240 may determine whether or
not a cartridge 100 is within the pump assembly 200 by, for example, a method similar to those described
in Section VIII-A above. Here, however, the controller need only determine whether a cartridge is in the
pump assembly at all, as opposed to determining whether a cartridge is precisely located within the
cartridge receiving area. If a cartridge is present, then the procedure is discontinued and an error message
is provided to the user (Steps S702 and S703). If no cartridge is present, then the controller 240
determines whether or not the plunger pusher 250 is in the fully retracted home position and, if for some
reason it is not, the controller automatically retracts the plunger pusher (Steps S704 and S705).
Alternatively, the user could be instructed to retract the pusher 250 through operation of the remote
control 1000.
          Relatively low torque is then applied to the gear assembly 362 by the motor 358 in the reverse
direction (Step S706). For example, approximately 20-70% (or 50%), or less than 20%, of the torque
(e.g., 5-10 mNm) that is applied in the forward dispensing direction during normal delivery may be
applied in the reverse direction. This may be accomplished by controlling power in the manner described
in Section IV-M above. It should be noted here that there may be some built-up gear compression that
will allow reverse motor rotation despite the fact that the plunger pusher has been fully retracted. Other
situations are described below.
          The power pulses will be sustained for a period corresponding to a predetermined number of
motor revolutions (e.g., 50 revolutions). Signals from the encoder 396 and, therefore, motor rotation may
be monitored. If the encoder signals indicate that the motor 358 has rotated at least a predetermined
number of revolutions (e.g., 20 revolutions), precisely synchronized to motor driving sequence of pulses,
the controller 240 determines that the motor is disconnected from the gear assembly 362 and creates a
"drive error" signal (Steps S707 and S708). If, on the other had, the encoder signals indicate that less
than the predetermined number of revolutions have occurred and that there is not a 1:1 correlation
between the driving pulses and the encoder signals, then the controller determines that gear assembly 362
is intact and creates a "drive OK" signal (Step S709). In other words, and somewhat counter intuitively,

the controller 240 determines that the gear assembly 362 is not operating properly if signals from the
encoder 396 indicate that the motor 358 is synchronized with the motor driving pulse sequence, and
determines that the gear assembly is operating properly if signals from the encoder indicate that the
motor is not synchronized with the motor driving pulse sequence.
         In those instances where the plunger pusher 250 has been fully retracted and there is no built-up
gear compression that would allow reverse rotation of the motor 358 under normal circumstances, the
process may be adjusted slightly. Here, the motor 358 may be driven first in the forward direction and
then in the rearward direction several times to verify whether or not the motor stalls after the same
number of pulses (as determined by, for example, the switch 398 in FIG. 29).
         As alluded to above, a GAV procedure may be performed each time the motor 358 stalls. During
zeroing and, in some embodiments, during homing, the motor 358 is stalled at controlled torque either
against the plunger (zeroing) or against a hard stop (homing). During this procedure, the motor 358 is
controlled to advance the mechanism at a known controlled torque while the motor encoder 396 is
monitored for rotation. Correct operation requires the system to stall (encoder 396 ceases to turn while
driving the motor 358) at a predetermined position. If the encoder 396 continues to indicate motor
rotation while drive signals are being sent to the motor 358, past the region of expected motor stall, it
indicates the possibility of gear assembly failure.
IX.      EXEMPLARY REMOTE CONTROLS AND ASSOCIATED METHODOLOGIES
         The present infusion pumps may be used in conjunction with a wide variety of remote controls.
Such remote controls may be used to, for example, allow the user to transmit instructions to the pump
assembly or facilitate communication between the pump assembly and the user (e.g., an alarm condition
message or other message concerning the conditions of the pump assembly).
         The particular type of remote control may depend on the desired level of functionality for a
particular user. A key fob type remote control which has one to four buttons may be provided in those
instances where the user's control options are to be limited to, for example, starting and stopping
medicament delivery procedures and withdrawing the plunger pusher from the cartridge. On the other
end of the spectrum, commercially available devices with full-function user interfaces (e.g., a keyboard
and a display, or a touch screen display), such as mobile telephones and personal digital assistants, may
be programmed to provide the desired level of remote control functionality.
         One exemplary remote control, which is generally represented by reference numeral 1000 in
FIGS. 98 and 99, is configured and dimensioned to be easily grasped and manipulated in the user's hand.
The exemplary remote control 1000 may include a power supply 1006 (e.g., one or more replaceable or
rechargeable batteries), a sending and receiving antenna          1008 that is adapted for use with a
corresponding sending and receiving antenna in the pump assembly (e.g., antenna 1002 in FIG. 51), and
a user interface 1010. Operations may be controlled by a controller 1012 (e.g. a microprocessor, memory,
firmware and/or software). Communication between the pump assembly 200 and remote control 1000
may be in the form of RF based communication (as described above) or other communication mediums

such as infrared and magnetic. The user interface 1010 may include a visual display 1014 (e.g., an LCD
display) and a plurality of buttons 1016 (e.g., switches, membrane keys, etc.). An alarm device 1018,
which may be audible (e.g., a buzzer), palpable (e.g., a vibrator), visible (e.g., an LED), or any
combination thereof, may also be provided.
         The exemplary remote control 1000 may also include a port or connector 1020 (e.g., a USB
connector) that allows communication with, for example, a personal computer, a printer, or a clinician's
programmer.
         The exemplary remote control 1000 may also be provided with a proximity sensor 1022 that,
when active, senses the distance between the remote control and the pump assembly 200. The controller
1012 may actuate the alarm device 1018 if the distance is too great, in order to remind the user to keep
the remote control 1000 close at hand.
         The exemplary remote control 1000 may be configured to facilitate one, some or all of the
following operations: (1) turning the remote control 1000 on or off, (2) associating (or "assigning") the
remote control 1000 to the pump assembly 200, (3) obtaining status information such as battery charge
level, medicament level, and/or alarm conditions, (4) silencing the pump assembly alarm, (5) selecting
options that may be associated with the pump assembly alarm such as type of alarm (audible, palpable,
and/or visible) and strength/volume of alarm, (6) connecting the remote control to a computer to, for
example, update remote control or pump assembly firmware, load and delete delivery profiles stored in
the pump assembly or remote control, and otherwise re-program the pump assembly or remote control,
and (7) selecting medicament options such as medicament concentrations.
         Other operations that may be performed through operation of the remote control 1000 include (1)
selecting and initiating a stored medicament delivery profile, (2) increasing and decreasing medicament
dose rate, (3) retracting the plunger pusher from the cartridge to the home position, and/or (4) pausing a
dispensing operation. A user may pause delivery in order to remove or replace a patient applied structure
(e.g. a cartridge, cannula or baseplate), adjust for a current or anticipated change body condition (e.g.,
low glucose, vigorous exercise), follow a physician's suggestion, or disconnect the pump assembly from
the body for any other reason.
         The exemplary remote control 1000 may be configured to generate an indicator, based on
information from the pump assembly controller (e.g., controller 240), that is indicative of the amount of
time remaining in the current dispensing program and/or the amount of time until the next cartridge
replacement and/or the amount of time until the pump assembly battery requires recharging. The
indicator may be audible, visible, palpable or combinations thereof. A time remaining indicator, such as
the exemplary time indicator 1024 on the remote control visual display 1014 (FIG. 98), may be useful for
a variety of reasons. For example, knowledge of the time remaining prior to next cartridge replacement
and/or battery recharging allows the patient to determine, based at least in part on the current time of day
and upcoming events (e.g., travel or sleep), whether or not it would be more convenient to replace the

medicament cartridge at a time prior to the end of the dispensing program and/or recharge the battery
prior to the point at which it is necessary.
         One exemplary type of visible time remaining indicator is the pie chart style "hours left" gauges
1024 and 1025 illustrated in FIG. 98. Any other suitable visible indicator may be employed. The visible
indicators 1024 and/or 1025 may be displayed whenever the display 1014 is active, displayed in response
to a user inquiry, displayed intermittently, and/or displayed in response to predetermined event (e.g.,
when 8 hours are remaining).
         The exemplary remote control 1000 may be configured to generate an indicator, based on
information from the pump assembly controller, that is indicative of the amount of medicament
remaining in the cartridge. The indicator may be audible, visible, palpable, or combinations thereof. The
exemplary visible "volume remaining" indicator 1026 may be displayed whenever the display 1014 is
active, displayed in response to a user inquiry, displayed intermittently, and/or displayed in response to
predetermined event (e.g. 25% remaining).
         Remaining time calculations may be performed by the pump assembly controller 240 and be
based, for example, on the total delivery duration for the associated cartridge (in view of the delivery
program and cartridge volume) and the portion of that total delivery duration which has thus far passed
based on actual delivery time (i.e., taking into account user stoppages, if any). Alternatively, or in
addition, the calculations may be based on the initial volume of the associated cartridge, the total number
of motor revolutions necessary to completely deliver the initial volume, the number of motor revolutions
that have occurred prior to the calculation (as evidenced by, for example, encoder signals), and amount
of time, based on the delivery program, before the total number of revolutions will be reached.
Remaining volume (as opposed to remaining time) calculations performed by the controller 240 may be
based on the initial volume of the associated cartridge, the number of motor revolutions necessary to
completely deliver the initial volume, and the number of motor revolutions that have occurred prior to
the calculation (as evidenced by, for example, encoder signals). Here, the information received by the
remote control 1000 from the pump assembly controller 240 will be the actual time/volume information
to be displayed.
         It should also be noted that the calculations described above may be performed by the remote
control controller 1012. Here, the information received by the remote control 1000 from the pump
assembly controller 240 may simply be encoder information. All other information (e.g. start time,
program being implemented, etc.) would be already available at the remote control itself.
         Additionally, in lieu of actual calculations, the pump assembly controller 240 and/or the remote
control controller 1012 may be pre-programmed to automatically generate a time and/or volume
indicator based on encoder information and a pre-programmed look-up table associated with the
dispensing program.
         With respect to the amount of time until the battery 238 requires recharging, the pump assembly
may be provided with a battery management chip (or other suitable battery management apparatus) that

determines when recharging is necessary. For example, recharging may be necessary when the battery
voltage is reduced from the fully charged voltage to a predetermined voltage that is less than the fully
charged voltage. The amount of time remaining may be estimated by the battery management apparatus
based on factors such as battery age, battery temperature, and the dispensing program. The battery
management apparatus may be part of, or operably connected to, the pump assembly controller 240. The
controller 240 is configured to generate a signal indicative of the amount of time remaining until the
battery will require recharging.
          One exemplary method that may stem from use of the information provided by a pump assembly
and/or a remote control is as follows. The user learns from the remote control (e.g., remote control 1000)
the amount of time (or medicament) remaining in the medicament dispensing program running on the
associated infusion device (e.g., cartridge 100 and pump assembly 200). The information may be
provided by the remote control 1000 in audible, visible and/or palpable form (e.g., with the time indicator
1024 and/or the volume remaining indicator 1026). The patient then determines, based on anticipated
activity or activities, whether it would be preferable to remove a not yet empty medicament cartridge and
replace it with a new medicament cartridge immediately, in the near future, or after the dispensing
program has been completed and the cartridge is empty. It may be that, at the end of the remaining time,
the user anticipates activity (e.g., sleeping, traveling, exercising, attending a social or business event)
which would render cartridge replacement inconvenient or impossible. Thus, the user may decide that it
is better to replace the cartridge before it is empty, and then do so.
          Turning to FIG. 100, the exemplary remote control 1000 may be used to alert the user to, and
specifically identify, a variety of alarm causes (or "conditions"). The exemplary remote control 1000
may be used to suggest actions to be taken in response to the alarms. The alarm causes and suggested
actions may be provided in audible or visible form. Exemplary alarm causes are identified AC 1-AC 16 in
FIG. 100, and are followed by a suggest action. "R and R" is used in FIG. 100 to represent "remove and
replace," and references to "cannula/baseplate" are references to both "patch pump" style baseplates
(e.g., baseplate 500), which are used in conjunction with a separate cannula, and "pocket pump" style
baseplates (e.g., baseplate 501), which may have their own cannula as part of an attached infusion set.
          The exemplary alarm cause (or "conditions") may include some or all of, but are not limited to, a
pump assembly 100 (and/or a baseplate 500) falling off the user's skin (AC-1), a battery with a low
charge level (AC-2), an error associated with an acoustic transducer or other alarm (AC-3), a fully
depleted battery (AC-4), a battery fault (AC-5), an occlusion (AC-6), a telemetry fault (AC-7), a motor
error, such motor current too low (AC-8), a baseplate/pump assembly disconnection (AC-9), a firmware
checksum error (AC-10), a variables checksum error (AC-11), a low reservoir (AC-12), an empty
reservoir (AC-13), a battery fault (AC-14), a zeroing procedure error (AC-15), and a temperature (e.g.
within the housing 202) above a preset limit (AC-16). Other alarm conditions may include an error
associated with pressure sensing hardware and delivery decision hardware.
