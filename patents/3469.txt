    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
    1. Field of the Invention
    The present invention relates generally to nuclear fuel assemblies used in the core of a
 5  nuclear reactor, and relates more specifically to metal nuclear fuel elements.
    2. Description of Related Art
    U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0252278 Al, the entire contents of which are
    incorporated herein by reference, discloses a nuclear fuel assembly that includes seed and
 0  blanket sub-assemblies. The blanket sub-assembly includes thorium-based fuel elements. The
    seed sub-assembly includes Uranium and/or Plutonium metal fuel elements used to release
    neutrons, which are captured by the Thorium blanket elements, thereby creating fissionable
    U-233 that burns in situ and releases heat for the nuclear power plant.
 5  PCT Publication No. W02011/143293 (Al), the entire contents of which are incorporated
    herein by reference, discloses a variety of fuel assemblies and fuel elements that utilize
    extruded, spiral (i.e., helically twisted) fuel elements with metal or ceramic fuel.
    SUMMARY OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
 '0 In the first aspect of the invention there is disclosed a fuel assembly for use in a core of a
    nuclear power reactor, the assembly comprising:
            a frame comprising a lower nozzle that is shaped and configured to mount to the
    nuclear reactor internal core structure; and
            a plurality of elongated, extruded fuel elements supported by the flame, each of said
25  plurality of fuel elements comprising a fuel kernel comprising fuel material disposed in a
    matrix of metal non-fuel material, the fuel material comprising fissile material, and
            a cladding surrounding the fuel kernel,
            wherein each of the fuel elements has a multi-lobed profile that foams spiral ribs,
    wherein the plurality of fuel elements provide all of the fissile material of the fuel assembly,
30          wherein each of the plurality of fuel elements is disposed in a different grid position
    of a grid pattern defined by the frame such that a subset of the plurality of fuel elements are
    disposed along an outer perimeter of the grid pattern,
            wherein at least one outer side of the cladding on at least some of the fuel elements
                                                       1

    5373C-AU-D1
    disposed along an outer perimeter of the grid pattern are laterally shortenedThe surface area
    of the cylindrical tube of conventional fuel rods limits the amount of heat that can be
    transferred from the rod to the primary coolant. To avoid overheating the fuel rod in view of
    the limited surface area for heat flux removal, the amount of fissile material in these uranium
 5  oxide fuel rods or mixed oxide (plutonium and uranium oxide) fuel rods has conventionally
    been substantially limited.
    In another aspect of the invention there is disclosed a fuel assembly for use in a core of a
    nuclear power reactor, the assembly comprising:
 0           a frame comprising a lower nozzle that is shaped and configured to mount to the
    nuclear reactor internal core structure; and
             a plurality of elongated fuel elements supported by the frame, each of said plurality of
    fuel elements comprising fissile material,
             wherein as viewed in a cross section that is perpendicular to an axial direction of the
 5  fuel assembly, the plurality of fuel elements are arranged into a mixed grid pattern that
    comprises a first grid pattern and a second grid pattern, the second grid pattern being different
    from the first grid pattern.
    The surface are of the cylindrical tube of convention fuel rods limits the amount of heat that
 '0 can be transferred from the rod to the primary coolant. To avoid overheating the fuel rod in
    vie of the limited surface area for heat flux removal, the amount of fissile material in these
    uranium oxide fuel rods or mixed oxide ( plutonium and uranium oxide) fuel rods has
    conventionally been substantially limited.
25  One or more preferred embodiments of the present invention overcome various disadvantages
    of conventional uranium oxide fuel rods by replacing them with all metal, multi-lobed,
    powder metallurgy co-extruded fuel rods (fuel elements). The metal fuel elements have
    significantly more surface area than their uranium oxide rod counterparts, and therefore
    facilitate significantly more heat transfer from the fuel element to the primary coolant at a
30  lower temperature. The spiral ribs of the multi-lobed fuel elements provide structural support
    to the fuel element, which may facilitate the reduction in the quantity or elimination of spacer
    grids that might otherwise have been required. Reduction in the quantity or elimination of
    such spacer grids advantageously reduces the hydraulic drag on the coolant, which can
    improve heat transfer to the coolant. Because the metal fuel elements may be relatively more
                                                     2

    5373C-AU-D1
    compact than their conventional uranium oxide fuel rod counterparts, more space within the
    fuel assembly is provided for coolant, which again reduces hydraulic drag and improves heat
    transfer to the coolant. The higher heat transfer from the metal fuel rods to the coolant means
    that it is possible to generate more heat (i.e., power), while simultaneously maintaining the
 5  fuel elements at a lower operating temperature due to the considerably higher thermal
    conductivity of metals versus oxides. Although conventional uranium oxide or mixed oxide
    fuel rods typically are limited to fissile material loading of around 4-5% due to overheating
    concerns, the higher heat transfer properties of the metal fuel elements according to various
    preferred embodiments of the present invention enable significantly greater fissile material
 0  loadings to be used while still maintaining safe fuel performance. Ultimately, the use of metal
    fuel elements according to one or more preferred embodiments of the present invention can
    provide more power from the same reactor core than possible with conventional uranium
    oxide or mixed oxide fuel rods.
 5  The use of all-metal fuel elements according to one or more preferred embodiments of the
    present invention may advantageously reduce the risk of fuel failure because the metal fuel
    elements reduce the risk of fission gas release to the primary coolant, as is possible in
    conventional uranium oxide or mixed oxide fuel rods.
 '0 The use of all-metal fuel elements according to one or more preferred embodiments of the
    present invention may also be safer than conventional uranium oxide fuel rods because the
    all-metal design increases heat transfer within the fuel element, thereby reducing temperature
    variations within the fuel element, and reducing the risk of localized overheating of the fuel
    element.

 5  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
    FIGS. 1-3 illustrate a fuel assembly 10 according to a preferred embodiment of the present
    invention. As shown in FIG. 3, the fuel assembly 10 comprises a plurality of fuel elements 20
    supported by a frame 25.
 0  As shown in FIG. 3, the frame 25 comprises a shroud 30, guide tubes 40, an upper nozzle 50,
    a lower nozzle 60, a lower tie plate 70, an upper tie plate 80, and/or other structure(s) that
    enable the assembly 10 to operate as a fuel assembly in a nuclear reactor. One or more of
    these components of the frame 25 may be omitted according to various preferred
    embodiments without deviating from the scope of the preferred embodiment of present
 5  invention.
    As shown in FIG. 3, the shroud 25 mounts to the upper nozzle 50 and lower nozzle 60. The
    lower nozzle 60 (or other suitable structure of the assembly 10) is constructed and shaped to
    provide a fluid communication interface between the assembly 10 and the reactor 90 into
 '0 which the assembly 10 is placed so as to facilitate coolant flow into the reactor core through
    the assembly 10 via the lower nozzle 60. The upper nozzle 50 facilitates direction of the
    heated coolant from the assembly 10 to the power plant's steam generators (for PWRs),
    turbines (for BWRs), etc. The nozzles 50, 60 have a shape that is specifically designed to
    properly mate with the reactor core internal structure.
25
    As shown in FIG. 3, the lower tie plate 70 and upper tie plate 80 are preferably rigidly
    mounted (e.g., via welding, suitable fasteners (e.g., bolts, screws), etc.) to the shroud 30 or
    lower nozzle 60 (and/or other suitable structural components of the assembly 10).
30  Lower axial ends of the elements 20 form pins 20a that fit into holes 70a in the lower tie plate
    70 to support the elements 20 and help maintain proper element 20 spacing. The pins 20a
    mount to the holes 70a in a manner that prevents the elements 20 from rotating about their
    axes or axially moving relative to the lower tie plate 70. This restriction on rotation helps to
    ensure that contact points between adjacent elements 20 all occur at the same axial positions
                                                    11

    5373C-AU-D1
    along the elements 20 (e.g., at self-spacing planes discussed below). The connection between
    the pins 20a and holes 70a may be created via welding, interference fit, mating non
    cylindrical features that prevent rotation (e.g., keyway and spline), and/or any other suitable
    mechanism for restricting axial and/or rotational movement of the elements 20 relative to the
 5  lower tie plate 70. The lower tie plate 70 includes axially extending channels (e.g., a grid of
    openings) through which coolant flows toward the elements 20.
    Upper axial ends of the elements 20 form pins 20a that freely fit into holes 80a in the upper
    tie plate 80 to permit the upper pins 20a to freely axially move upwardly through to the upper
 0  tie plate 80 while helping to maintain the spacing between elements 20. As a result, when the
    elements 20 axially grow during fission, the elongating elements 20 can freely extend further
    into the upper tie plate 80.
    As shown in FIG. 4, the pins 20a transition into a central portion of the element 20.
 5
    FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate an individual fuel element/rod 20 of the assembly 10. As shown in
    FIG. 5, the elongated central portion of the fuel element 20 has a four-lobed cross-section. A
    cross-section of the element 20 remains substantially uniform over the length of the central
    portion of the element 20. Each fuel element 20 has a fuel kernel 100, which includes a
 '0 refractory metal and fuel material that includes fissile material.
    A displacer 1 10 that comprises a refractory metal is placed along the longitudinal axis in the
    center of the fuel kernel 100. The displacer 1 10 helps to limit the temperature in the center of
    the thickest part of the fuel element 20 by displacing fissile material that would otherwise
25  occupy such space and minimize variations in heat flux along the surface of the fuel element.
    According to various preferred embodiments, the displacer 1 10 may be eliminated
    altogether.
    As shown in FIG. 5, the fuel kernel 100 is enclosed by a refractory metal cladding 120. The
30  cladding 120 is preferably thick enough, strong enough, and flexible enough to endure the
    radiation-induced swelling of the kernel 100 without failure (e.g., without exposing the kernel
    100 to the environment outside the cladding 120). According to one or more preferred
    embodiments, the entire cladding 120 is at least 0.3 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.5 mm, and/or 0.7 mm
    thick. According to one or more preferred embodiments, the cladding 120 thickness is at least
                                                      12

    5373C-AU-D1
    0.4 mm in order to reduce a chance of swelling-based failure, oxidation based failure, and/or
    any other failure mechanism of the cladding 120.
    The cladding 120 may have a substantially uniform thickness in the annular direction (i.e.,
 5  around the perimeter of the cladding 120 as shown in the cross-sectional view of FIG. 5) and
    over the axial/longitudinal length of the kernel 100 (as shown in FIG. 4). Alternatively, as
    shown in FIG. 5, according to one or more preferred embodiments, the cladding 120 is
    thicker at the tips of the lobes 20b than at the concave intersection/area 20c between the lobes
    20b. For example, according to one or more preferred embodiments, the cladding 120 at the
 0  tips of the lobes 20b is at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%,
    125%, and/or 150% thicker than the cladding 120 at the concave intersections/areas 20c. The
    thicker cladding 120 at the tips of the lobes 20b provides improved wear resistance at the tips
    of the lobes 20b where adjacent fuel elements 20 touch each other at the self-spacing planes
    (discussed below).
 5
    The refractory metal used in the displacer 1 10, the fuel kernel 100, and the cladding 120
    comprises zirconium according to one or more preferred embodiments of the invention. As
    used herein, the term zirconium means pure zirconium or zirconium in combination with
    other alloy material(s). However, other refractory metals may be used instead of zirconium
 '0 without deviating from the scope of the present invention (e.g., niobium, molybdenum,
    tantalum, tungsten, rhenium, titanium, vanadium, chromium, zirconium, hafnium, ruthenium,
    osmium, iridium, and/or other metals). As used herein, the term "refractory metal" means any
    metal alloy that has a melting point above 1800 degrees Celsius (2073K).
25  Moreover, in certain preferred embodiments, the refractory metal may be replaced with
    another non-fuel metal, e.g., aluminium. However, the use of a non-refractory non-fuel metal
    is best suited for reactor cores that operate at lower temperatures (e.g., small cores that have a
    height of about 1 meter and an electric power rating of 100 MWe or less). Refractory metals
    are preferred for use in cores with higher operating temperatures.
30
    As shown in FIG. 5, the central portion of the fuel kernel 100 and cladding 120 has a four
    lobed profile forming spiral spacer ribs 130. The displacer 110 may also be shaped so as to
    protrude outwardly at the ribs 130 (e.g., corners of the square displacer 110 are aligned with
    the ribs 130). According to alternative preferred embodiments of the present invention, the
                                                      13

  5373C-AU-D1
  fuel elements 20 may have greater or fewer numbers of ribs 130 without deviating from the
  scope of the present invention. For example, as generally illustrated in FIG. 5 of U.S. Patent
  Application Publication No. 2009/0252278 Al, a fuel element may have three ribs/lobes,
  which are preferably equally circumferentially spaced from each other. The number of
5 lobes/ribs 130 may depend, at least in part, on the shape of the fuel assembly 10. For
  example, a four-lobed element 20 may work well with a square cross-sectioned fuel assembly
  10 (e.g., as is used in the AP-1000). In contrast, a three-lobed fuel element may work well
  with a hexagonal fuel assembly (e.g., as is used in the VVER).
0 FIG. 9 illustrates various dimensions of the fuel element 20 according to one or more
  preferred embodiments. According to one or more preferred embodiments, any of these
  dimensions, parameters and/or ranges, as identified in the below table, can be increased or
  decreased by up to 50%, 10%, 15 %, 20%, 25 %, 30%, 40%, 50%, or more without deviating
  from the scope of the preferred embodiments of present invention.

   As shown in FIG. 5, the displacer 110 has a crss-sectional shape ofa square regular
   quadrilateral with the comers ofthe square regular quadrilateral being aligned with the ribs
    130. The displacer I 10 forms a spiral that follows the spiral of the ribs 130 so that the corners
 5 of the displacer I 10 remain aligned with the ribs 130 along the axial length of the fuel kernel
    100. In alternative preferred embodiments with greater or fewer ribs 130, the displacer I 10
   preferably has the cross-sectional shape of a regular polygon having as many sides as the
   element 20 has fibs.
10 As shown in FIG. 6, the cmss-sectional area ofthe central portion of the element 20 is
   preferably substantially smaller than the area of a square 200 in which the tip of each of the
   ribs 130 is tangent to one side of the square 200. In more generic terms, the cross-sectional
   area of an element 20 having n ribs is preferably smaller than the area of a regular polygon
   having n sides in which the tip of each of the ribs 130 is tangent to one side of the polygon.

    5373C-AU-D1
    According to various preferred embodiments, a ratio of the area of the element 20 to the area
    of the square (or relevant regular polygon for elements 20 having greater or fewer than four
    ribs 130) is less than 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.35, 0.3. As shown in FIG. 1, this area ratio
    approximates how much of the available space within the shroud 30 is taken up by the fuel
 5  elements 20, such that a lower ratio means that more space is advantageously available for
    coolant, which also acts as a neutron moderator and which increases the moderator-to-fuel
    ratio (important for neutronics), reduces hydraulic drag, and increases the heat transfer from
    the elements 20 to the coolant. According to various preferred embodiments, the resulting
    moderator to fuel ratio is at least 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, and/or 3.0 (as opposed to 1.96 when
 0  conventional cylindrical uranium oxide rods are used). Similarly, according to various
    preferred embodiments, the fuel assembly 10 flow area is increased by over 16% as
    compared to the use of one or more conventional fuel assemblies that use cylindrical uranium
    oxide rods. The increased flow area may decrease the coolant pressure drop through the
    assembly 10 (relative to conventional uranium oxide assemblies), which may have
 5  advantages with respect to pumping coolant through the assembly 10.
    As shown in FIG. 4, the element 20 is axially elongated. In the illustrated preferred
    embodiment, each element 20 is a full-length element and extends the entire way from lower
    tie plate 70 at or near the bottom of the assembly 10 to the upper tie plate 80 at or near the top
 '0 of the assembly 10. According to various preferred embodiments and reactor designs, this
    may result in elements 20 that are anywhere from 1 meter long (for compact reactors) to over
    4 meters long. Thus, for typical reactors, the elements 20 may be between 1 and 5 meters
    long. However, the elements 20 may be lengthened or shortened to accommodate any other
    sized reactor without deviating from the scope of the present invention.
25
    While the illustrated elements 20 are themselves full length, the elements 20 may
    alternatively be segmented, such that the multiple segments together make a full length
    element. For example, 4 individual 1 meter element segments 20 may be aligned end to end
    to effectively create the full-length element. Additional tie plates 70, 80 may be provided at

    segments.
    According to one or more preferred embodiments, the fuel kernel 100 comprises a
    combination of a refractory metal/alloy and fuel material. The refractory metal/alloy may
                                                       16

    5373C-AU-D1
    comprise a zirconium alloy. The fuel material may comprise low enriched uranium (e.g.,
    U235, U233), plutonium, or thorium combined with low enriched uranium as defined below
    and/or plutonium. As used herein, "low enriched uranium" means that the whole fuel material
    contains less than 20% by weight fissile material (e.g., uranium-235 or uranium-233).
 5  According to various preferred embodiments, the uranium fuel material is enriched to
    between 1% and 20%, 5% and 20%, 10% and 20%, and/or 15% and 20% by weight of
    uranium-235. According to one or more preferred embodiments, the fuel material comprises
    19.7% enriched uranium-235.
 0  According to various preferred embodiments, the fuel material may comprise a 3- 10%, 10
    4 0%   , 15- 3 5%, and/or 2 0- 3 0% volume fraction of the fuel kernel 100. According to various
    preferred embodiments, the refractory metal may comprise a 60-99%, 60-97%, 70-97%, 60
    90%, 6 5- 8 5%, and/or 70-80% volume fraction of the fuel kernel 100. According to one or
    more preferred embodiments, volume fractions within one or more of these ranges provide an
 5  alloy with beneficial properties as defined by the material phase diagram for the specified
    alloy composition. The fuel kernel 100 may comprise a Zr-U alloy that is a high-alloy fuel
    (i.e., relatively high concentration of the alloy constituent relative to the uranium constituent)
    comprised of either 6-phase UZr 2 , or a combination of 6-phase UZr 2 and 6 -phase Zr.
    According to one or more preferred embodiments, the 5-phase of the U-Zr binary alloy
 '0 system may range from a zirconium composition of approximately 65-81 volume percent
    (approximately 63 to 80 atom percent) of the fuel kernel 100. One or more of these preferred
    embodiments have been found to result in low volumetric, irradiation-induced swelling of the
    fuel element 20. According to one or more such preferred embodiments, fission gases are
    entrained within the metal kernel 100 itself, such that one or more preferred embodiments of
25  the fuel element 20 can omit a conventional gas gap from the fuel element 20. According to
    one or more preferred embodiments, such swelling may be significantly less than would
    occur if low alloy (a-phase only) compositions were used (e.g., at least 10%, 2 0%, 3 0%, 50%,
    75%, 100%,       2 0 0 %, 3 0 0 %, 500%, 1000%, 12 0 0 %, 1500%, or greater reduction in volume
    percent swelling per atom percent burnup than if a low alloy a-phase U-I OZr fuel was used).
30  According to one or more preferred embodiments of the present invention, irradiation
    induced swelling of the fuel element 20 or kernel 100 thereof may be less than 20, 15, 10, 5,
    4, 3, and/or 2 volume percent per atom percent burnup. According to one or more preferred
    embodiments, swelling is expected to be around one volume percent per atom percent
    bumup.
                                                        17

    5373C-AU-D1
    According to one or more preferred embodiments of the present invention, the fuel kernel is
    replaced with a plutonium-zirconium binary alloy with the same or similar volume
    percentages as with the above-discussed U-Zr fuel kernels 100, or with different volume
 5  percentages than with the above-discussed U-Zr fuel kernels 100. For example, the plutonium
    fraction in the kernel 100 may be substantially less than a corresponding uranium fraction in
    a corresponding uranium-based kernel 100 because plutonium typically has about 60-70%
    weight fraction of fissile isotopes, while LEU uranium has 20% or less weight fraction of
    fissile U-235 isotopes. According to various preferred embodiments, the plutonium volume
 0  fraction in the kernel 100 may be less than 15%, less than 10%, and/or less than 5%, with the
    volume fraction of the refractory metal being adjusted accordingly.
    The use of a high-alloy kernel 100 according to one or more preferred embodiments of the
    present invention may also result in the advantageous retention of fission gases during
 5  irradiation. Oxide fuels and low-alloy metal fuels typically exhibit significant fission gas
    release that is typically accommodated by the fuel design, usually with a plenum within the
    fuel rod to contain released fission gases. The fuel kernel 100 according to one or more
    preferred embodiments of the present invention, in contrast, does not release fission gases.
    This is in part due to the low operating temperature of the fuel kernel 100 and the fact that
 '0 fission gas atoms (specifically Xe and Kr) behave like solid fission products. Fission gas
    bubble formation and migration along grain boundaries to the exterior of the fuel kernel 100
    does not occur according to one or more preferred embodiments. At sufficiently high
    temperatures according to one or more preferred embodiments, small (a few micron
    diameter) fission gas bubbles may form. However, these bubbles remain isolated within the
25  fuel kernel 100 and do not form an interconnected network that would facilitate fission gas
    release, according to one or more preferred embodiments of the present invention. The
    metallurgical bond between the fuel kernel 100 and cladding 120 may provide an additional
    barrier to fission gas release.
30  According to various preferred embodiments, the fuel kernel 100 (or the cladding 120 or
    other suitable part of the fuel element 20) of one or more of the fuel elements 20 can be
    alloyed with a burnable poison such as gadolinium, boron, erbium or other suitable neutron
    absorbing material to form an integral burnable poison fuel element. Different fuel elements
    20 within a fuel assembly 10 may utilize different burnable poisons and/or different amounts
                                                    18

    5373C-AU-D1
    of burnable poison. For example, some of fuel elements 20 of a fuel assembly 10 (e.g., less
    than 75%, less than 50%, less than 20%, 1-15%, 1 -12%, 2-12%, etc.) may include kernels
    100 with 25, 20, and/or 15 weight percent or less Gd (e.g., 1 -25 weight percent, 1-15 weight
    percent, 5-15 weight percent, etc.). Other fuel elements 20 of the fuel assembly 10 (e.g., 10
 5  95%, 10-50%, 20-50%, a greater number of the fuel elements 20 than the fuel elements 20
    that utilize Gd) may include kernels 100 with 10 or 5 weight percent or less Er (e.g., 0.1 -10.0
    weight percent, 0.1 to 5.0 weight percent etc.).
    According to various preferred embodiments, the burnable poison displaces the fuel material
 0  (rather than the refractory metal) relative to fuel elements 20 that do not include burnable
    poison in their kernels 100. For example, according to one preferred embodiment of a fuel
    element 20 whose kernel 100 would otherwise include 65 volume percent zirconium and 35
    volume percent uranium in the absence of a poison, the fuel element 20 includes a kernel 100
    that is 16.5 volume percent Gd, 65 volume percent zirconium, and 18.5 volume percent
 5  uranium. According to one or more other preferred embodiments, the burnable poison instead
    displaces the refractory metal, rather than the fuel material. According to one or more other
    preferred embodiments, the burnable poison in the fuel kernel 100 displaces the refractory
    metal and the fuel material proportionally. Consequently, according to various of these
    preferred embodiments, the burnable poison within the fuel kernel 100 may be disposed in
 '0 the 6-phase of UZr 2 or 6 -phase of Zr such that the presence of the burnable poison does not
    change the phase of the UZr 2 alloy or Zr alloy in which the burnable poison is disposed.
    Fuel elements 20 with a kernel 100 with a burnable poison may make up a portion (e.g., 0
    100%, 1-99%, 1-50%, etc.) of the fuel elements 20 of one or more fuel assemblies 10 used in
25  a reactor core. For example, fuel elements 20 with burnable poison may be positioned in
    strategic locations within the fuel assembly lattice of the assembly 10 that also includes fuel
    elements 20 without burnable poison to provide power distribution control and to reduce
    soluble boron concentrations early in the operating cycle. Similarly, select fuel assemblies 10
    that include fuel elements 20 with burnable poison may be positioned in strategic locations
30  within the reactor core relative to assemblies 10 that do not include fuel elements 20 with
    burnable poison to provide power distribution control and to reduce soluble boron
    concentrations early in the operating cycle. The use of such integral burnable absorbers may
    facilitate the design of extended operating cycles.
                                                     19

    5373C-AU-D1
    Alternatively and/or additionally, separate non-fuel bearing burnable poison rods may be
    included in the fuel assembly 10 (e.g., adjacent to fuel elements 20, in place of one or more
    fuel elements 20, inserted into guide tubes in fuel assemblies 10 that do not receive control
    rods, etc.). In one or more preferred embodiments, such non-fuel burnable poison rods can be
 5  designed into a spider assembly similar to that which is used in the Babcock and Wilcox or
    Westinghouse designed reactors (referred to as burnable poison rod assemblies (BPRA)).
    These then may be inserted into the control rod guide tubes and locked into select fuel
    assemblies 10 where there are no control banks for the initial cycle of operation for reactivity
    control. When the burnable poison cluster is used it may be removed when the fuel assembly
 0  is relocated for the next fuel cycle. According to an alternative preferred embodiment in
    which the separate non-fuel bearing burnable poison rods are positioned in place of one or
    more fuel elements 20, the non-fuel burnable poison rods remain in the fuel assembly 10 and
    are discharged along with other fuel elements 20 when the fuel assembly 10 reaches its
    usable life.
 5
    The fuel elements 20 are manufactured via powder-metallurgy co-extrusion. Typically, the
    powdered refractory metal and powdered metal fuel material (as well as the powdered
    burnable poison, if included in the kernel 100) for the fuel kernel 100 are mixed, the displacer
    110 blank is positioned within the powder mixture, and then the combination of powder and
 '0 displacer 110 is pressed and sintered into fuel core stock/billet (e.g., in a mold that is heated
    to varying extents over various time periods so as to sinter the mixture). The displacer 110
    blank may have the same or similar cross-sectional shape as the ultimately formed displacer
    110. Alternatively, the displacer 110 blank may have a shape that is designed to deform into
    the intended cross-sectional shape of the displacer 110 upon extrusion. The fuel core stock
25  (including the displacer 110 and the sintered fuel kernel 100 material) is inserted into a
    hollow cladding 120 tube that has a sealed tube base and an opening on the other end. The
    opening on the other end is then sealed by an end plug made of the same material as the
    cladding to form a billet. The billet may be cylindrically shaped, or may have a shape that
    more closely resembles the ultimate cross-sectional shape of the element 20, for example, as
30  shown in FIGS. 5 and 9. The billet is then co-extruded under temperature and pressure
    through a die set to create the element 20, including the finally shaped kernel 100, cladding
    110, and displacer 120. According to various preferred embodiments that utilize a non
    cylindrical displacer 110, the billet may be properly oriented relative to the extrusion press
    die so that comers of the displacer 110 align with the lobes 20b of the fuel element 20. The
                                                    20

    5373C-AU-D1
    extrusion process may be done by either direct extrusion (i.e., moving the billet through a
    stationary die) or indirect extrusion (i.e., moving the die toward a stationary billet). The
    process results in the cladding 120 being metallurgically bonded to the fuel kernel 100, which
    reduces the risk of delamination of the cladding 120 from the fuel kernel 100. The tube and
 5  end plug of the cladding 120 metallurgically bond to each other to seal the fuel kernel 100
    within the cladding 120. The high melting points of refractory metals used in the fuel
    elements 10 tend to make powder metallurgy the method of choice for fabricating
    components from these metals.
 0  According to one or more alternative preferred embodiments, the fuel core stock of the fuel
    elements 20 may be manufactured via casting instead of sintering. Powdered or monolithic
    refractory metal and powdered or monolithic fuel material (as well as the powdered burnable
    poison, if included in the kernel 100) may be mixed, melted, and cast into a mold. The mold
    may create a displacer-blank-shaped void in the cast kernel 100 such that the displacer 110
 5  blank may be inserted after the kernel 100 is cast, in the same manner that the cladding 120 is
    added to form the billet to be extruded. The remaining steps for manufacturing the fuel
    elements 20 may remain the same as or similar to the above-discuss preferred embodiment
    that utilizes sintering instead of casting. Subsequent extrusion results in metallurgical
    bonding between the displacer 110 and kernel 100, as well as between the kernel 100 and
 '0 cladding 120.
    According to one or more alternative preferred embodiments, the fuel elements 20 are
    manufactured using powdered ceramic fuel material instead of powdered metal fuel material.
    The remaining manufacturing steps may be the same as discussed above with respect to the
25  preferred embodiments using powdered metal fuel material. In various metal fuel preferred
    embodiments and ceramic fuel embodiments, the manufacturing process may result in a fuel
    kernel 100 comprising fuel material disposed in a matrix of metal non-fuel material. In one or
    more of the metal fuel preferred embodiments, the resulting fuel kernel 100 comprises a
    metal fuel alloy kernel comprising an alloy of the metal fuel material and the matrix of metal
30  non-fuel material (e.g., a uranium-zirconium alloy). In one or more of the preferred ceramic
    fuel embodiments, the kernel 100 comprises ceramic fuel material disposed in (e.g.,
    interspersed throughout) the matrix of metal non-fuel material. According to various
    preferred embodiments, the ceramic fuel material used in the manufacturing process may
    comprise powdered uranium or plutonium oxide, powdered uranium or plutonium nitride,
                                                     21

    5373C-AU-D1
    powdered uranium or plutonium carbide, powdered uranium or plutonium hydride, or a
    combination thereof. In contrast with conventional U0 2 fuel elements in which U0 2 pellets
    are disposed in a tube, the manufacturing process according to one or more preferred
    embodiments of the present invention results in ceramic fuel being disposed in a solid matrix
 5  of non-fuel material (e.g., a zirconium matrix).
    As shown in FIG. 4, the axial coiling pitch of the spiral ribs 130 is selected according to the
    condition of placing the axes of adjacent fuel elements 10 with a spacing equal to the width
    across corners in the cross section of a fuel element and may be 5% to 20% of the fuel
 0  element 20 length. According to one preferred embodiment, the pitch (i.e., the axial length
    over which a lobe/rib makes a complete rotation) is about 21.5 cm, while the full active
    length of the element 20 is about 420 cm. As shown in FIG. 3, stability of the vertical
    arrangement of the fuel elements 10 is provided: at the bottom - by the lower tie plate 70; at
    the top - by the upper tie plate 80; and relative to the height of the core - by the shroud 30. As
 5  shown in FIG. 1, the fuel elements 10 have a circumferential orientation such that the lobed
    profiles of any two adjacent fuel elements 10 have a common plane of symmetry which
    passes through the axes of the two adjacent fuel elements 10 in at least one cross section of
    the fuel element bundle.
 '0 As shown in FIG. 1, the helical twist of the fuel elements 20 in combination with their
    orientation ensures that there exists one or more self-spacing planes. As shown in FIG. 1, in
    such self spacing planes, the ribs of adjacent elements 20 contact each other to ensure proper
    spacing between such elements 20. Thus, the center-to-center spacing of elements 20 will be
    about the same as the corner-to-comer width of each element 20 (12.6 mm in the element
25  illustrated in FIG. 5). Depending on the number of lobes 20b in each fuel element 20 and the
    relative geometrical arrangement of the fuel elements 20, all adjacent fuel elements 20 or
    only a portion of the adjacent fuel elements 20 will contact each other. For example, in the
    illustrated preferred four-lobed embodiment, each fuel element 20 contacts all four adjacent
    fuel elements 20 at each self-spacing plane. However, in a three-lobed fuel element preferred
30  embodiment in which the fuel elements are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, each fuel
    element will only contact three of the six adjacent fuel elements in a given self-spacing plane.
    The three-lobed fuel element will contact the other three adjacent fuel elements in the next
    axially-spaced self-spacing plane (i.e., 1/6 of a turn offset from the previous self-spacing
    plane).
                                                     22

    5373C-AU-D1
    In an n-lobed element 20 in which n fuel elements are adjacent to a particular fuel element
    20, a self-spacing plane will exist every 1/n helical turn (e.g., every % helical turn for a four
    lobed element 20 arranged in a square pattern such that four other fuel elements 20 are
 5  adjacent to the fuel element 20; every 1/3 helical turn for a three-lobed element in which
    three fuel elements are adjacent to the fuel element (i.e., every 120 degrees around the
    perimeter of the fuel element)). The pitch of the helix may be modified to create greater or
    fewer self-spacing planes over the axial length of the fuel elements 20. According to one
    preferred embodiment, each four-lobed fuel element 20 includes multiple twists such that
 0  there are multiple self-spacing planes over the axial length of the bundle of fuel elements 20.
    In the illustrated preferred embodiment, all of the elements 20 twist in the same direction.
    However, according to an alternative preferred embodiment, adjacent elements 20 may twist
    in opposite directions without deviating from the scope of the present invention.
 5
    The formula for the number of self-spacing planes along the fuel rod length is as follows:
    N=n*L/h, where:
             L - Fuel rod length
             n - Number of lobes (ribs) and the number of fuel elements adjacent to a fuel element
 10          h - Helical twist pitch
    The formula is slightly different if the number of lobes and the number of fuel elements
    adjacent to a fuel element are not the same.
    As a result of such self-spacing, the fuel assembly 10 may omit spacer grids that may
25  otherwise have been necessary to assure proper element spacing along the length of the
    assembly 10. By eliminating spacer grids, coolant may more freely flow through the
    assembly 10, which advantageously increases the heat transfer from the elements 20 to the
    coolant. However, according to alternative preferred embodiments of the present invention,
    the assembly 10 may include spacer grid(s) without deviating from the scope of the present
30  invention.
    As shown in FIG. 3, the shroud 30 forms a tubular shell that extends axially along the entire
    length of the fuel elements 20 and surrounds the elements 20. However, according to an
    alternative preferred embodiment of the present invention, the shroud 30 may comprise
                                                    23

    5373C-AU-D1
    axially-spaced bands, each of which surrounds the fuel elements 20. One or more such bands
    may be axially aligned with the self-spacing planes. Axially extending corner supports may
    extend between such axially spaced bands to support the bands, maintain the bands
    alignment, and strengthen the assembly. Alternatively and/or additionally, holes may be cut
 5  into the otherwise tubular/polygonal shroud 30 in places where the shroud 30 is not needed or
    desired for support. Use of a full shroud 30 may facilitate greater control of the separate
    coolant flows through each individual fuel assembly 10. Conversely, the use of bands or a
    shroud with holes may facilitate better coolant mixing between adjacent fuel assemblies 10,
    which may advantageously reduce coolant temperature gradients between adjacent fuel
 0  assemblies 10.
    As shown in FIG. 1, the cross-sectional perimeter of the shroud 30 has a shape that
    accommodates the reactor in which the assembly 10 is used. In reactors such as the AP- 1000
    that utilize square fuel assemblies, the shroud has a square cross-section. However, the
 5  shroud 30 may alternatively take any suitable shape depending on the reactor in which it is
    used (e.g., a hexagonal shape for use in a VVER reactor (e.g., as shown in FIG. 1 of U.S.
    Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0252278 Al).
    The guide tubes 40 provide for the insertion of control absorber elements based on boron
 '0 carbide (B4 C), silver indium cadmium (Ag, In, Cd), dysprosium titanate (Dy 2 0 3 .TiO 2 ) or
    other suitable alloys or materials used for reactivity control (not shown) and burnable
    absorber elements based on boron carbide, gadolinium oxide (Gd 2 0 3 ) or other suitable
    materials (not shown) and are placed in the upper nozzle 50 with the capability of elastic
    axial displacement. The guide tubes 40 may comprise a zirconium alloy. For example, the
25  guide tube 40 arrangement shown in FIG. 1 is in an arrangement used in the AP-1000 reactor
    (e.g., 24 guide tubes arranged in two annular rows at the positions shown in the 17x17 grid).
    The shape, size, and features of the frame 25 depend on the specific reactor core for which
    the assembly 10 is to be used. Thus, one of ordinary skill in the art would understand how to
30  make appropriately shaped and sized frame for the fuel assembly 10. For example, the frame
    25 may be shaped and configured to fit into a reactor core of a conventional nuclear power
    plant in place of a conventional uranium oxide or mixed oxide fuel assembly for that plant's
    reactor core. The nuclear power plant may comprise a reactor core design that was in actual
    use before 2010 (e.g., 2, 3 or 4-loop PWRs; BWR-4). Alternatively, the nuclear power plant
                                                    24

    5373C-AU-D1
    may be of an entirely new design that is specifically tailored for use with the fuel assembly
    10.
    As explained above, the illustrated fuel assembly 10 is designed for use in an AP-1000 or
 5  EPR reactor. The assembly includes a 17x 17 array of fuel elements 20, 24 of which are
    replaced with guide tubes 40 as explained above for a total of 265 fuel elements 20 in EPR or
    264 fuel elements 20 in AP- 1000 (in the AP- 1000, in addition to the 24 fuel elements being
    replaced with the guide tubes, a central fuel element is also replaced with an instrumented
    tube).
 0
    The elements 20 preferably provide 100% of the overall fissile material of the fuel assembly
    10. Alternatively, some of the fissile material of the assembly 10 may be provided via fuel
    elements other than the elements 20 (e.g., non-lobed fuel elements, uranium oxide elements,
    elements having fuel ratios and/or enrichments that differ from the elements 20). According
 5  to various such alternative preferred embodiments, the fuel elements 20 provide at least 50%,
    60%, 7 0%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and/or 95% by volume of the overall fissile material of the
    fuel assembly 10.
    Use of the metal fuel elements 20 according to one or more preferred embodiments of the
 '0 present invention facilitate various advantages over the uranium oxide or mixed oxide fuel
    conventionally used in light water nuclear reactors (LWR) (including boiling water reactors
    and pressurized water reactors) such as the Westinghouse-designed AP-1000, AREVA
    designed EPR reactors, or GE-designed ABWR. For example, according to one or more
    preferred embodiments, the power rating for an LWR operating on standard uranium oxide or
25  mixed oxide fuel could be increased by up to about 30% by substituting the all-metal fuel
    elements 20 and/or fuel assembly 10 for standard uranium oxide fuel and fuel assemblies
    currently used in existing types of LWRs or new types of LWRs that have been proposed.
    One of the key constraints for increasing power rating of LWRs operating on standard
30  uranium oxide fuel has been the small surface area of cylindrical fuel elements that such fuel
    utilizes. A cylindrical fuel element has the lowest surface area to volume ratio for any type of
    fuel element cross-section profile. Another major constraint for standard uranium oxide fuel
    has been a relatively low burnup that such fuel elements could possibly reach while still
    meeting acceptable fuel performance criteria. As a result, these factors associated with
                                                    25

    5373C-AU-D1
    standard uranium oxide or mixed oxide fuel significantly limit the degree to which existing
    reactor power rating could be increased.
    One or more preferred embodiments of the all-metal fuel elements 20 overcome the above
 5  limitations. For example, as explained above, the lack of spacer grids may reduce hydraulic
    resistance, and therefore increase coolant flow and heat flux from the elements 20 to the
    primary coolant. The helical twist of the fuel elements 20 may increase coolant intermixing
    and turbulence, which may also increase heat flux from the elements 20 to the coolant.
 0  Preliminary neutronic and thermal-hydraulic analyses have shown the following according to
    one or more preferred embodiments of the present invention:
             - The thermal power rating of an LWR reactor could be increased by up to 30.7% or
    more (e.g., the thermal power rating of an EPR reactor could be increased from 4.59 GWth to
    6.0 GWth).
 5           - With a uranium volume fraction of 25% in the uranium-zirconium mixture and
    uranium- 235 enrichment of 19.7%, an EPR reactor core with a four-lobe metallic fuel
    element 20 configuration could operate for about 500-520 effective full power days (EFPDs)
    at the increased thermal power rating of 6.0 GWth if 72 fuel assemblies were replaced per
    batch (once every 18 months) or 540-560 EFPDs if 80 fuel assemblies were replaced per
 .0 batch (once every 18 months).
             - Due to the increased surface area in the multi-lobe fuel element, even at the
    increased power rating of 6.0 GWth, the average surface heat flux of the multi-lobe fuel
    element is shown to be 4-5% lower than that for cylindrical uranium oxide fuel elements
    operating at the thermal power rating of 4.59 GWth. This could provide an increased safety
25  margin with respect to critical heat flux (e.g., increased departure from nucleate boiling
    margin in PWRs or maximum fraction limiting critical power ratio in BWRs). Further, this
    could allow a possibility of using 12 fuel elements per assembly with burnable poisons.
    Burnable poisons could be used to remove excess reactivity at the beginning of cycle or to
    increase the Doppler Effect during the heat-up of the core.
30           - Thus, the fuel assemblies 10 may provide greater thermal power output at a lower
    fuel operating temperature than conventional uranium oxide or mixed oxide fuel assemblies.
    To utilize the increased power output of the assembly 10, conventional power plants could be
    upgraded (e.g., larger and/or additional coolant pumps, steam generators, heat exchangers,
    pressurizes, turbines). Indeed, according to one or more preferred embodiments, the upgrade
                                                     26

    5373C-AU-D1
    could provide 30-40% more electricity from an existing reactor. Such a possibility may avoid
    the need to build a complete second reactor. The modification cost may quickly pay for itself
    via increased electrical output. Alternatively, new power plants could be constructed to
    include adequate features to handle and utilize the higher thermal output of the assemblies 10.
 5
    Further, one or more preferred embodiments of the present invention could allow an LWR to
    operate at the same power rating as with standard uranium oxide or mixed oxide fuel using
    existing reactor systems without any major reactor modifications. For example, according to
    one preferred embodiment:
 0           - An EPR would have the same power output as if conventional uranium-oxide fuel
    were used: 4.59 GWt;
             - With a uranium volume fraction of 25% in the uranium-zirconium mixture and
    uranium- 235 enrichment of approximately 15%, an EPR reactor core with a four-lobe
    metallic fuel element 20 configuration could operate for about 500-520 effective full power
 5  days (EFPDs) if 72 fuel assemblies were replaced per batch or 540-560 EFPDs if 80 fuel
    assemblies were replaced per batch.
             - The average surface heat flux for the elements 20 is reduced by approximately 30%
    compared to that for cylindrical rods with conventional uranium oxide fuel (e.g., 39.94 v.
    57.34 W/cm 2 ). Because the temperature rise of the coolant through the assembly 10 (e.g., the
 .0 difference between the inlet and outlet temperature) and the coolant flow rate through the
    assembly 10 remain approximately the same relative to conventional fuel assemblies, the
    reduced average surface heat flux results in a corresponding reduction in the fuel rod surface
    temperature that contributes to increased safety margins with respect to critical heat flux (e.g.,
    increased departure from nucleate boiling margin in PWRs or maximum fraction limiting
25  critical power ratio in BWRs).
    Additionally and/or alternatively, fuel assemblies 10 according to one or more preferred
    embodiments of the present invention can be phased/laddered into a reactor core in place of
    conventional fuel assemblies. During the transition period, fuel assemblies 10 having
30  comparable fissile/neutronic/thermal outputs as conventional fuel assemblies can gradually
    replace such conventional fuel assemblies over sequential fuel changes without changing the
    operating parameters of the power plant. Thus, fuel assemblies 10 can be retrofitted into an
    existing core that may be important during a transition period (i.e., start with a partial core
    with fuel assemblies 10 and gradually transition to a full core of fuel assemblies 10).
                                                    27

   5373C-AU-D1
   Moreover, the fissile loading of assemblies 10 can be tailored to the particular transition
   desired by a plant operator. For example, the fissile loading can be increased appropriately so
   as to increase the thermal output of the reactor by anywhere from 0% to 30% or more higher,
 5 relative to the use of conventional fuel assemblies that the assemblies 10 replace.
   Consequently, the power plant operator can chose the specific power uprate desired, based on
   the existing plant infrastructure or the capabilities of the power plant at various times during
   upgrades.

   One or more preferred embodiments of the fuel assemblies 10 and fuel elements 20 may be
   used in fast reactors (as opposed to light water reactors) without deviating from the scope of
   the present invention. In fast reactors, the non-fuel metal of the fuel kernel 100 is preferably a
   refractory metal, for example a molybdenum alloy (e.g., pure molybdenum or a combination
 5 of molybdenum and other metals), and the cladding 120 is preferably stainless steel (which
   includes any alloy variation thereof) or other material suitable for use with coolant in such
   reactors (e.g., sodium). Such fuel elements 20 may be manufactured via the above-discussed
   co-extrusion process or may be manufactured by any other suitable method (e.g., vacuum
   melt).

   As shown in FIGS. 7A, 7B, and 8, fuel assemblies 510 accordingly to one or more preferred
   embodiments of the present invention may be used in a pressurized heavy water reactor 500
   (see FIG. 8) such as a CANDU reactor.
25 As shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, the fuel assembly 510 comprises a plurality of fuel elements
   20 mounted to a frame 520. The frame 520 comprises two end plates 520a, 520b that mount
   to opposite axial ends of the fuel elements 20 (e.g., via welding, interference fits, any of the
   various types of attachment methods described above for attaching the elements 20 to the
   lower tie plate70). The elements 20 used in the fuel assembly 510 are typically much shorter
30 than the elements 20 used in the assembly 10. According to various preferred embodiments
   and reactors 500, the elements 20 and assemblies 510 used in the reactor 500 may be about
   18 inches long.
                                                    28

    5373C-AU-D1
    The elements 20 may be positioned relative to each other in the assembly 510 so that self
    spacing planes maintain spacing between the elements 20 in the manner described above with
    respect to the assembly 10. Alternatively, the elements 20 of the assembly 510 may be so
    spaced from each other that adjacent elements 20 never touch each other, and instead rely
 5  entirely on the frame 520 to maintain element 20 spacing. Additionally, spacers may be
    attached to the elements 20 or their ribs at various positions along the axial length of the
    elements 20 to contact adjacent elements 20 and help maintain element spacing 20 (e.g., in a
    manner similar to how spacers are used on conventional fuel rods of conventional fuel
    assemblies for pressurized heavy water reactors to help maintain rod spacing).
 0
    As shown in FIG. 8, the assemblies 510 are fed into calandria tubes 500a of the reactor 500
    (sometimes referred to in the art as a calandria 500). The reactor 500 uses heavy water 500b
    as a moderator and primary coolant. The primary coolant 500b circulates horizontally
    through the tubes 500a and then to a heat exchanger where heat is transferred to a secondary
 5  coolant loop that is typically used to generate electricity via turbines. Fuel assembly loading
    mechanisms (not shown) are used to load fuel assemblies 510 into one side of the calandria
    tubes 500a and push spent assemblies 510 out of the opposite side of the tubes 500a, typically
    while the reactor 500 is operating.
 .0 The fuel assemblies 510 may be designed to be a direct substitute for conventional fuel
    assemblies (also known as fuel bundles in the art) for existing, conventional pressurized
    heavy water reactors (e.g., CANDU reactors). In such a preferred embodiment, the
    assemblies 510 are fed into the reactor 500 in place of the conventional assemblies/bundles.
    Such fuel assemblies 510 may be designed to have neutronic/thermal properties similar to the
25  conventional assemblies being replaced. Alternatively, the fuel assemblies 510 may be
    designed to provide a thermal power uprate. In such uprate preferred embodiments, new or
    upgraded reactors 500 can be designed to accommodate the higher thermal output.
    According to various preferred embodiments of the present invention, the fuel assembly 10 is
30  designed to replace a conventional fuel assembly of a conventional nuclear reactor. For
    example, the fuel assembly 10 illustrated in FIG. 1 is specifically designed to replace a
    conventional fuel assembly that utilizes a 17x17 array of U0     2 fuel rods. If the guide tubes 40
    of the assembly 10 are left in the exact same position as they would be for use with a
    conventional fuel assembly, and if all of the fuel elements 20 are the same size, then the pitch
                                                    29

    5373C-AU-D1
    between fuel elements/rods remains unchanged between the conventional U0 2 fuel assembly
    and one or more preferred embodiments of the fuel assembly 10 (e.g., 12.6 mm pitch). In
    other words, the longitudinal axes of the fuel elements 20 may be disposed in the same
    locations as the longitudinal axes of conventional U0 2 fuel rods would be in a comparable
 5  conventional fuel assembly. According to various preferred embodiments, the fuel elements
    20 may have a larger circumscribed diameter than the comparable U0 2 fuel rods (e.g., 12.6
    mm as compared to an outer diameter of 9.5 mm for a typical U0 2 fuel rod). As a result, in
    the self-aligning plane illustrated in FIG. 1 , the cross- sectional length and width of the space
    occupied by the fuel elements 20 may be slightly larger than that occupied by conventional
 0  U0 2 fuel rods in a conventional fuel assembly (e.g., 214.2 mm for the fuel assembly 10 (i.e.,
    17 fuel elements 20 x 12.6 mm circumscribed diameter per fuel element), as opposed to 21
    1.1 mm for a conventional U0 2 fuel assembly that includes a 17 x 17 array of 9.5 mm U0 2
    fuel rods separated from each other by a 12.6 mm pitch). In conventional U0 2 fuel
    assemblies, a spacer grid surrounds the fuel rods, and increases the overall cross- sectional
 5  envelope of the conventional fuel assembly to 214 mm x 214 mm. In the fuel assembly 10,
    the shroud 30 similarly increases the cross-sectional envelope of the fuel assembly 10. The
    shroud 30 may be any suitable thickness (e.g., 0.5 mm or 1.0 mm thick). In a preferred
    embodiment that utilizes a 1.0 mm thick shroud 30, the overall cross-sectional envelope of an
    preferred embodiment of the fuel assembly 10 may be 216.2 mm x 216.2 mm (e.g., the 214
 .0 mm occupied by the 17 12.6 mm diameter fuel elements 20 plus twice the 1.0 mm thickness
    of the shroud 30). As a result, according to one or more preferred embodiments of the present
    invention, the fuel assembly 10 may be slightly larger (e.g., 216.2 mm x 216.2 mm) than a
    typical U0 2 fuel assembly (214 mm x 214 mm). The larger size may impair the ability of the
    assembly 10 to properly fit into the fuel assembly positions of one or more conventional
25  reactors, which were designed for use with conventional U0 2 fuel assemblies. To
    accommodate this size change, according to one or more preferred embodiments of the
    present invention, a new reactor may be designed and built to accommodate the larger size of
    the fuel assemblies 10.
30  According to an alternative preferred embodiment of the present invention, the circumscribed
    diameter of all of the fuel elements 20 may be reduced slightly so as to reduce the overall
    cross-sectional size of the fuel assembly 10. For example, the circumscribed diameter of each
    fuel element 20 may be reduced by 0.13 mm to 12.47 mm, so that the overall cross-sectional
    space occupied by the fuel assembly 10 remains comparable to a conventional 214 mm by
                                                     30

    5373C-AU-D1
    214 mm fuel assembly (e.g., 17 12.47 mm diameter fuel elements 20 plus two 1.0 mm
    thickness of the shroud, which totals about 214 mm). Such a reduction in the size of the 17 by
    17 array will slightly change the positions of the guide tubes 40 in the fuel assembly 10
    relative to the guide tube positions in a conventional fuel assembly. To accommodate this
 5  slight position change in the tube 40 positions, the positions of the corresponding control rod
    array and control rod drive mechanisms in the reactor may be similarly shifted to
    accommodate the repositioned guide tubes 40. Alternatively, if sufficient clearances and
    tolerances are provided for the control rods in a conventional reactor, conventionally
    positioned control rods may adequately fit into the slightly shifted tubes 40 of the fuel
 0  assembly 10.
    Alternatively, the diameter of the peripheral fuel elements 20 may be reduced slightly so that
    the overall assembly 10 fits into a conventional reactor designed for conventional fuel
    assemblies. For example, the circumscribed diameter of the outer row of fuel elements 20
 5  may be reduced by 1.1 mm such that the total size of the fuel assembly is 214 mm x 214 mm
    (e.g., 15 12.6 mm fuel elements 20 plus 21 1.5 mm fuel elements 20 plus 21.0 mm
    thicknesses of the shroud 30). Alternatively, the circumscribed diameter of the outer two
    rows of fuel elements 20 may be reduced by 0.55 mm each such that the total size of the fuel
    assembly remains 214 mm x 214 mm (e.g., 13 12.6 mm fuel elements 20 plus 4 12.05 mm
 .0 fuel assemblies plus 2 1.0 mm thicknesses of the shroud 30). In each preferred embodiment,
    the pitch and position of the central 13x13 array of fuel elements 20 and guide tubes 40
    remains unaltered such that the guide tubes 40 align with the control rod array and control rod
    drive mechanisms in a conventional reactor.
25  FIG. 10 illustrates a fuel assembly 610 according to an alternative preferred embodiment of
    the present invention. According to various preferred embodiments, the fuel assembly 610 is
    designed to replace a conventional U0    2 fuel assembly in a conventional reactor while
    maintaining the control rod positioning of reactors designed for use with various conventional
    U0  2 fuel assemblies. The fuel assembly 610 is generally similar to the fuel assembly 10,
30  which is described above and illustrated in FIG. 1, but includes several differences that help
    the assembly 610 to better fit into one or more existing reactor types (e.g., reactors using
    Westinghouse's fuel assembly design that utilizes a 17 by 17 array of U0 2 rods) without
    modifying the control rod positions or control rod drive mechanisms.
                                                     31

    5373C-AU-D1
    As shown in FIG. 10, the fuel assembly includes a 17 by 17 array of spaces. The central 15
    by 15 array is occupied by 200 fuel elements 20 and 25 guide tubes 40, as described above
    with respect to the similar fuel assembly 10 illustrated in FIG. 1. Depending on the specific
    reactor design, the central guide tube 40 may be replaced by an additional fuel element 20 if
 5  the reactor design does not utilize a central tube 40 (i.e., 201 fuel elements 20 and 24 guide
    tubes 40). The guide tube 40 positions correspond to the guide tube positions used in reactors
    designed to use conventional U0    2 fuel assemblies.
    The peripheral positions (i.e., the positions disposed laterally outward from the fuel elements
 0  20) of the 17 by 17 array/pattern of the fuel assembly 610 are occupied by 64 U0     2 fuel
    elements/rods 650. As is known in the art, the fuel rods 650 may comprise standard U0 2
    pelletized fuel disposed in a hollow rod. The U0 2 pelletized fuel may be enriched with U-235
    by less than 20%, less than 15%, less than 10%, and/or less than 5%. The rods 650 may have
    a slightly smaller diameter (e.g., 9.50 mm) than the circumscribed diameter of the fuel
 5  elements 20, which slightly reduces the overall cross-sectional dimensions of the fuel
    assembly 610 so that the assembly 610 better fits into the space allocated for a conventional
    U0  2 fuel assembly.
    In the illustrated preferred embodiment, the fuel rods/elements 650 comprise U0 2 pelletized
 .0 fuel. However, the fuel rods/elements 650 may alternatively utilize any other suitable
    combination of one or more fissile and/or fertile materials (e.g., thorium, plutonium,
    uranium- 235, uranium-233, any combinations thereof). Such fuel rods/elements 650 may
    comprise metal and/or oxide fuel.
25  According to one or more alternative preferred embodiments, the fuel rods 650 may occupy
    less than all of the 64 peripheral positions. For example, the fuel rods 650 may occupy the top
    row and left column of the periphery, while the bottom row and right column of the periphery
    may be occupied by fuel elements 20. Alternatively, the fuel rods 650 may occupy any other
    two sides of the periphery of the fuel assembly. The shroud 630 may be modified so as to
30  enclose the additional fuel elements 20 in the periphery of the fuel assembly. Such modified
    fuel assemblies may be positioned adjacent each other such that a row/column of peripheral
    fuel elements 650 in one assembly is always adjacent to a row/column of fuel elements 20 in
    the adjacent fuel assembly. As a result, additional space for the fuel assemblies is provided by
    the fact that the interface between adjacent assemblies is shifted slightly toward the assembly
                                                     32

    5373C-AU-D1
    that includes fuel elements 650 in the peripheral, interface side. Such a modification may
    provide for the use of a greater number of higher heat output fuel elements 20 than is
    provided by the fuel assemblies 610.
 5  A shroud 630 surrounds the array of fuel elements 20 and separates the elements 20 from the
    elements 650. The nozzles 50, 60, shroud 630, coolant passages formed therebetween,
    relative pressure drops through the elements 20 and elements 650, and/or the increased
    pressure drop through the spacer grid 660 (discussed below) surrounding the elements 650
    may result in a higher coolant flow rate within the shroud 630 and past the higher heat output
 0  fuel elements 20 than the flow rate outside of the shroud 630 and past the relatively lower
    heat output fuel rods 650. The passageways and/or orifices therein may be designed to
    optimize the relative coolant flow rates past the elements 20, 650 based on their respective
    heat outputs and designed operating temperatures.
 5  According to various preferred embodiments, the moderator: fuel ratio for the fuel elements
    20 of the fuel assembly 610 is less than or equal to 2.7, 2.6, 2.5, 2.4, 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0, 1.9,
    and/or 1.8. In the illustrated preferred embodiment, the moderator: fuel ratio equals a ratio of
    (1) the total area within the shroud 630 available for coolant/moderator (e.g., approximated
    by the total cross- sectional area within the shroud 630 minus the total cross-sectional area
 .0 taken up by the fuel elements 20 (assuming the guide tubes 40 are filled with coolant)) to (2)
    the total cross-sectional area of the kernels 100 of the fuel elements 20 within the shroud 630.
    According to a preferred alternative embodiment of the invention, the shroud 630 may be
    replaced with one or more annular bands or may be provided with holes in the shroud 630, as
25  explained above. The use of bands or holes in the shroud 630 may facilitate cross-mixing of
    coolant between the fuel elements 20 and the fuel elements 650.
    As shown in FIG. 10, the fuel elements 650 are disposed within an annular spacer grid 660
    that is generally comparable to the outer part of a spacer grid used in a conventional U0 2 fuel
30  assembly. The spacer grid 660 may rigidly connect to the shroud 630 (e.g., via welds, bolts,
    screws, or other fasteners). The spacer grid 660 is preferably sized so as to provide the same
    pitch between the fuel elements 650 and the fuel elements 20 as is provided between the
    central fuel elements 20 (e.g., 12.6 mm pitch between axes of all fuel elements 20, 650). To
    provide such spacing, the fuel elements 650 may be disposed closer to the outer side of the
                                                    33

    5373C-AU-D1
    spacer grid 660 than to the shroud 630 and inner side of the spacer grid 660. The fuel
    assembly 610 and spacer grid 660 are also preferably sized and positioned such that the same
    pitch is provided between fuel elements 650 of adjacent fuel assemblies (e.g., 12.6 mm
    pitch). However, the spacing between any of the fuel elements 20, 650 may vary relative to
 5  the spacing between other fuel elements 20, 650 without deviating from the scope of the
    present invention.
    According to various preferred embodiments, the fuel elements 20 provide at least 60%, 65%,
    70%, 75%, and/or 80% of a total volume of all fissile-material-containing fuel elements 20,
 0  650 of the fuel assembly 610. For example, according to one or more preferred embodiments
    in which the fuel assembly 610 includes 201 fuel elements 20, each having a cross-sectional
                         2
    area of about 70mm , and 64 fuel elements 650, each having a 9.5 mm diameter, the fuel
    elements 20 provide about 75.6% of a total volume of all fuel elements 20, 650 (201 fuel
    elements 20 x 70 mm2 equals 14070 mm2 ; 64 fuel elements 650 x 7c x (9.5/2)2 =4534 mm 2 ;
 5  fuel element 20, 650 areas are essentially proportional to fuel element volumes; (14070
    mm 2/( 14070 mm2 + 4534mm 2)=75.6%)).
    The height of the fuel assembly 610 matches a height of a comparable conventional fuel
    assembly that the assembly 610 can replace (e.g., the height of a standard fuel assembly for a
 .0 Westinghouse or AREVA reactor design).
    The illustrated fuel assembly 610 may be used in a 17x17 PWR such as the Westinghouse 4
    loop design, AP1000, or AREVA EPR. However, the design of the fuel assembly 610 may
    also be modified to accommodate a variety of other reactor designs (e.g., reactor designs that
25  utilize a hexagonal fuel assembly, in which case the outer periphery of the hexagon is
    occupied by U0 2 rods, while the inner positions are occupied by fuel elements 20, or boiling
    water reactors, or small modular reactors). While particular dimensions are described with
    regard to particular preferred embodiments, a variety of alternatively dimensioned fuel
    elements 20, 650 and fuel assemblies 10 may be used in connection with a variety of reactors
30  or reactor types without deviating from the scope of the present invention.
    Depending on the specific reactor design, additional rod positions of a fuel assembly may be
    replaced with U0 2 rods. For example, while the fuel assembly 610 includes U0 2 rods only in
                                                   34

    5373C-AU-D1
    the outer peripheral row, the assembly 610 could alternatively include U0 2 rods in the outer
    two rows without deviating from the scope of the present invention.
    According to various preferred embodiments, the portion of the fuel assembly 610 that
 5  supports the fuel elements 650 is inseparable from the portion of the fuel assembly 610 that
    supports the fuel elements 20. According to various preferred embodiments, the fuel elements
    20 are not separable as a unit from the fuel elements 650 of the fuel assembly 610 (even
    though individual fuel elements 20, 650 may be removed from the assembly 610, for
    example, based on individual fuel element failure). Similarly, there is not a locking
 0  mechanism that selectively locks the fuel element 650 portion of the fuel assembly to the fuel
    element 20 portion of the fuel assembly 610. According to various preferred embodiments,
    the fuel elements 20 and fuel elements 650 of the fuel assembly 610 have the same designed
    life cycle, such that the entire fuel assembly 610 is used within the reactor, and then removed
    as a single spent unit.

    According to various preferred embodiments, the increased heat output of the fuel elements
    20 within the fuel assembly 610 can provide a power uprate relative to the conventional all
    U0   2 fuel rod assembly that the assembly 610 replaces. According to various preferred
    embodiments, the power uprate is at least 5%, 10%, and/or 15%. The uprate may be between
 .0  1 and 30%, 5 and 25%, and/or 10 and 20% according to various preferred embodiments.
    According to various preferred embodiments, the fuel assembly 610 provides at least an 18
    month fuel cycle, but may also facilitate moving to a 24+ or 36+ month fuel cycle. According
    to an preferred embodiment of the fuel assembly 610, which uses fuel elements 20 having the
    example parameters discussed above with respect to the element 20 shown in FIG. 10, the
25  assembly 17 provides a 17% uprate relative to a conventional U0     2  fuel assembly under the
    operating parameters identified in the below tables.

   FIGS. 11 -13 illustrate a fuel assembly 710 according to a preferred alternative embodiment
   of the present invention. According to various preferred embodiments, the fuel assembly 710
   is designed to replace a conventional U0       2 fuel assembly in a conventional reactor while
 5 maintaining the conventional U0 2 -fuel based control rod positioning of the reactor. The fuel
   assembly 710 is generally similar to or identical to the fuel assembly 610, except that the U0 2
   rods 650 in the peripheral row of the fuel assembly 610 are replaced with metal fuel elements
   730, 740. As explained below, the fuel elements 730, 740 are modified to help the assembly
   710 to better fit into one or more existing reactor types (e.g., reactors using Westinghouse's
 0 fuel assembly design that utilizes a 17 by 17 array of U0      2 rods) without modifying the
   control rod positions, control rod drive mechanisms, or outer dimensions of the fuel
   assembly. The fuel elements 730, 740 define a subset of the overall fuel elements 20, 730,
   740 of the fuel assembly 710, wherein the subset is disposed along an outer peripheral
   row/perimeter/ring of grid positions of the 17 by 17 grid pattern of the fuel assembly 710.
15
   FIG. 11 is a partial cross-sectional view of the fuel assembly 710 shown in a self-spacing
   plane. The fuel elements 20, 730, 740 are arranged such that their centerline axes are
   disposed in a square 17 by 17 grid pattern. In the illustrated preferred embodiment, the
   centerline-to-centerline spacing between any two adjacent fuel elements 20, 730, 740 in the
20 fuel assembly 710 is preferably the same (e.g., 12.6 mm) and matches the circumscribed
   diameter of the fuel elements 20, 730, 740. To fit into the space envelope available in
   conventional reactors (e.g., the AP-1000) with conventional guide tube 40 locations, the outer
                                                       36

    5373C-AU-D1
    sides of the fuel elements 730, 740 are laterally reduced in size so as to fit within the shroud
    750. In FIG. 11, the area of lateral reduction is illustrated by dotted lines.
    As shown in FIGS. 13A and 13B, the fuel elements 20, 730 are similar, and preferably have
 5  the same circumscribed diameter (e.g., 12.6 mm), which facilitates self-spacing between the
    fuel elements 20, 730. The fuel element 730 may be similar to or identical to the fuel element
    20, except that: (1) the fuel kernel 760 of the fuel element 730 is smaller than the fuel kernel
    100 of the fuel element 20, (2) the cladding 770 of fuel element 730 is on average thicker
    than the cladding 120 of the fuel element 20, and (3) one circumferential side 770a of the
 0  cladding 770 has been laterally reduced relative to other circumferential sides to remove a
    portion 770b of the original cladding 770.
    Making the fuel kernel 760 smaller and the cladding 770 thicker enables the portion 770b of
    the cladding 770 to be removed while still ensuring a sufficiently thick layer of cladding 770
 5  around the kernel 760. According to various preferred embodiments, the cladding 700
    thickness is at least 0.4, 0.5, and/or 0.6 mm throughout the fuel element 730.
    The removed portion 770b is preferably removed after the fuel element 730 is formed into the
    spiral, lobed shape. The removed portion 770b may be removed in any suitable way (e.g.,
 '0 grinding, honing, milling, etc.). As a result of the spiral, the removed portion 770b will be
    removed from the circumferentially aligned portions on a plurality of the lobes of the fuel
    element 730. In other words, portions 770b of lobes of the cladding 770 are removed in the
    area where the lobe is disposed at the side 770a of the fuel element 730 that will be adjacent
    to and abut the shroud 750. Due to the helical twist of the fuel elements 730, the cladding 770
25  is not removed uniformly from the fuel element 730, but rather only at the tips 770a of the
    lobes that impinge on the assembly 710 envelope boundary, as limited by the shroud 750.
    According to various preferred embodiments, a radial shortening distance 780 of the removed
    portion 770b may be at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and/or 10 %, and/or less then 30, 20, and/or
30  15 % of the circumscribed diameter D of the fuel element 730. According to various
    preferred embodiments, the radial shortening distance 780 may be at least 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8,
    0.9, 1.0, 1.1 , 1.2, and/or 1.3 mm, and/or less than 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, and/or 1.5 mm.
                                                     37

    5373C-AU-D1
    According to alternative preferred embodiments, the fuel element 730 may be originally
    formed in its final shape such that the removed portions 770b were never present and need
    not be removed.
 5  As shown in FIG. 11, the corner fuel element 740 may be essentially identical to the side fuel
    element 730 except that two circumferentially spaced sides 770a of the cladding 770 of the
    fuel element 740 (rather than just one side 770a as is done in the fuel element 730) have been
    laterally reduced to remove portions 770b so that the fuel element 740 appropriately fits in
    the corner grid position of the fuel assembly 710 and abut the two orthogonal sides of the
 0  shroud 750.
    Although, according to some non-limiting preferred embodiments, the fuel kernels 760 of the
    fuel elements 730, 740 have a smaller volume (or area as viewed in cross-section
    perpendicular to the elongated, axial direction of the fuel assembly) than the kernels 100 of
 5  the fuel elements 20, the fuel kernels 730, 740 retain various other benefits provided by the
    fuel element 20's shape and design, as explained elsewhere herein. According to various
    preferred embodiments, the fissile loading of the kernels 760 may be increased (e.g., via more
    highly enriched uranium) relative to the non-peripheral kernels 20 to offset for the smaller
    kernel 760 volume.
 10
    As shown in FIG. 13B, the removal of the removed portion 770b results in a geometric axial
    centerline 800 (i.e., the center of the circle that circumscribes the helically twisted shape of
    the fuel element 730) of the fuel elements 730, 740 being offset from the axial center of mass
    810 of the fuel elements 730, 740 (and/or the axial center of mass of the cladding 770).
25  According to various non-limiting preferred embodiments, the offset may be at least 0.1, 0.3,
    0.4, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and/or 5.0 % of the circumscribed diameter D, and/or less then 30,
    20, and/or 10 % of the circumscribed diameter D. According to various non-limiting
    preferred embodiments, an axial center of mass of the kernel 760 (see FIG. 13B) remains at
    the axial centerline 800 of the fuel element 730.
30
    According to various preferred embodiments, the fuel elements 20, 730, 740 are between 1
    and 5 meters long (measured in the axial direction) and the circumscribed diameter is
    between 6 and 40 mm, between 6 and 30 mm, between 6 and 20 mm, between 9 and 15 mm,
    and/or about 12.6 mm. According to various preferred embodiments, a ratio of the axial
                                                      38

    5373C-AU-D1
    length of the fuel elements 730, 740 to their circumscribed diameter D is at least 10:1, 20:1,
    30:1, 40:1, 50:1, 100:1, 200:1, and/or 300:1, and/or less than 1000:1.
    In the self-spacing plane shown in FIG. 11 , the laterally reduced down sides 770a of the fuel
 5  elements 730, 740 contact the shroud 750 to facilitate self-spacing of the fuel elements 20,
    730, 740.
    FIG. 12 is a cross-sectional view of the fuel assembly 710 shown in a plane that is axially
    disposed (e.g., along the elongated length of the fuel assembly 710) half way between two
 0  self-spacing planes. In this plane, none of the cladding 770 has been removed from the fuel
    elements 730, 740 because the lobes of the fuel elements 730, 740 are sufficiently spaced
    from the shroud 750 such that the fuel elements 730,740 fit without having material 770b
    removed at this axial position of the fuel elements 730, 740.
 5  Although the fuel elements 730, 740 and fuel assembly 710 are illustrated as being designed
    for use in a reactor that utilizes a 17 by 17 square grid pattern fuel assembly with a specific
    guide tube pattern embedded therein, the fuel assembly 710 and fuel elements 20, 730, 740
    may alternatively be used with a variety of other types of reactors (e.g., reactors that utilize
    16 by 16 or 14 by 14 grid patterns, reactors with hexagonal fuel element grid patterns and
 '0 fuel assemblies). For example, if fuel elements 20 would not properly fit into a fuel assembly
    for use in a reactor designed for hexagonal fuel assemblies and grid patterns, the peripheral
    row of the hexagonal grid of such a fuel assembly may comprise fuel elements like the fuel
    elements 730, 740 that have been modified so that their outer side(s) are ground down to fit in
    the particular required envelope, preferably without having to relocate the guide tube
25  positions of the reactor.
    FIGS. 14-20 illustrate a fuel assembly 910 according to an alternative preferred embodiment
    of the present invention. According to various preferred embodiments, the fuel assembly 910
    is designed to replace a conventional U0 2 fuel assembly in a conventional reactor while
30  maintaining the control rod positioning of the conventional reactor (e.g., a reactor in use as of
    2012). The fuel assembly 910 is generally similar to or identical to the fuel assemblies 610,
    710, except that: (1) all of the fuel elements 920a, 920b, 920c, 920d of the fuel assembly 910
    are preferably geometrically identical to each other; (2) four fuel elements are removed from
    the peripheral row; (3) the centerlines 920a' of the fuel elements 920a in the non-comer
                                                     39

   5373C-AU-D1
   peripheral row are shifted inwardly to form equilateral triangles with centerlines 920a' of
   adjacent non-corner peripheral fuel element(s) 920a and the centerline(s) 920c' of the
   outermost non-peripheral row of fuel element(s) 920c; and (4) the centerline 920b'of the
   peripheral comer fuel elements 920b is shifted inwardly relative to the fuel elements 740, 650
 5 of the fuel assemblies 610, 710.
   As shown in FIG. 14, all of the fuel elements 920, 920a, 920b, 920c may be geometrically
   identical to each other, and may all comprise fuel elements 20 as discussed above. However,
   the fissile loading of different ones of the fuel elements 920, 920a, 920b, 920c may be
 0 different (e.g., to level out the heat load generated across the fuel assembly 910). Each of the
   fuel elements 920a, 920b, 920c, 920d have the same circumscribed diameter (e.g., 12.6 mm).
   According to alternative preferred embodiments, the fuel elements 920a, 920b, 920c, 920d
   are not geometrically identical to each other.
 5 By shifting the outer peripheral row/subset of fuel elements 920a, 920b laterally inwardly,
   sufficient space is provided such that fuel elements 920a, 920b, 920c, 920d with a
   circumscribed diameter that is the same as the centerline -to-centerline spacing between fuel
   elements 920a, 920b, 920c, 920d can be used while fitting within the envelope of space
   provided in the above-discussed conventional reactors.
 0
   As shown in FIG. 14, the central 15 by 15 square pattern of grid positions for the central fuel
   elements 920c, 920d and guide tubes 40 matches the central 15 by 15 square pattern and
   positions of conventional fuel assemblies for the reactor.
25 The outer peripheral row of fuel elements 920a, 920c are shifted laterally inwardly toward the
   center of the fuel assembly 910. The inward shifting helps the assembly 910 to better fit into
   one or more existing reactor types (e.g., reactors using Westinghouse's fuel assembly design
   that utilizes a 17 by 17 array of U0   2 rods) without modifying the control rod/guide tube 40
   positions, control rod drive mechanisms, or fuel assembly dimensions.
30
   In the preferred embodiment illustrated in FIG. 16, the 12.6 mm circumscribed diameter fuel
   elements 920a are shifted laterally inwardly such that a center-to-center distance between the
   centerlines 920a' of the fuel elements 920a and the centerlines 920c' of the fuel elements 920c
   are offset by about 10.9 mm as projected in the row/column grid direction of the central 15 by
                                                     40

   5373C-AU-D1
   15 grid pattern. Had the fuel elements 920a maintained the positions of the conventional 17
   by 17 grid pattern, the offset would have been 12.6 mm, rather than 10.9 mm. The inward
   shifting of the fuel elements 920a results in an overall row or column width of about 211 mm
   (15 total 12.6 mm pitches plus 2 total 10.9 mm pitches), which fits within the about 211 mm
 5 row and column envelope within the shroud 940. When the thickness of the shroud 940 is
   added, the overall row and column width of the fuel assembly 910 fits within the 214 mm
   envelope provided by an exemplary conventional reactor into which the fuel assembly 910 is
   designed to fit.
 0 Four fuel elements are omitted from the outer peripheral row/ring relative to a conventional
   fuel assembly so as to facilitate the inward shifting of the fuel elements 920a, 920b. In the
   preferred embodiment illustrated in FIG. 14, the outer peripheral row/ring of fuel elements
   includes 56 fuel elements 920a and 4 fuel elements 920b for a total of 60 fuel elements. For
   reference, a conventional 17 by 17 fuel assembly would include 64 fuel elements in the outer
 5 peripheral row/ring of grid positions.
   As shown in FIG. 15, the axial centerlines 920c' of the fuel elements 920c in the next-to
   peripheral row and the axial centerlines 920a' of the non-corner peripheral row fuel elements
   920a form equilateral triangles in which the center-to-center distances equal the
 0 circumscribed diameter of the fuel elements 920a, 920c.
   As shown in FIGS. 15-18, the fuel elements 920a, 920c and shroud 940 have a variety of
   different partial self-spacing planes at different axial positions along the fuel assembly 910.
   In the cross section shown in FIGS. 15 and 16, the fuel elements 920a abut and self-space
25 with each other and the shroud 940. In the cross-sections shown in FIGS. 17 and 18, each fuel
   element 920a abuts and self-spaces with one of the fuel elements 920c. In total, as viewed in
   the orientation shown in FIG. 15, each fuel element 920a has a self-spacing point at: 0
   degrees with the shroud 940 (shown in FIG. 15); 90 degrees and 270 degrees with adjacent
   fuel elements 920a (shown in FIG. 15); 150 degrees with one inner fuel element 920c (shown
30 in FIG. 18); and 210 degrees with another inner fuel element 920c (shown in FIG. 17). This
   combination of partial self-spacing planes combine to provide proper self-spacing of the fuel
   elements 920a.
                                                    41

   5373C-AU-D1
   As shown in FIGS. 14 and 15, the plurality of fuel elements 920, 920a, 920c are arranged into
   a mixed grid pattern that comprises: (1) a first grid pattern (the middle 15 by 15 array of fuel
   elements 920c, 920d) made of squarely arranged rows and columns having a centerline-to
   centerline distance between the rows and columns that equals the common circumscribed
 5 diameter D of the fuel elements 920a, 920b, 920c, 920d, and (2) a second grid pattern (the
   outer two peripheral rows made up of the fuel elements 920a, 920c) made up of equilateral
   triangles in which a length of each side of each triangle (i.e., the centerline-to-centerline
   distance between adjacent fuel elements defining the comers of each triangle) is the common
   circumscribed diameter D of the fuel elements 920a, 920b, 920c, 920d. Thus, the
 0 second/triangular grid pattern is different from the first/square grid pattern. According to
   alternative preferred embodiments, additional and/or alternative grid patterns could also be
   used (e.g., rectangular grid patterns, isometric triangle patterns, parallelogram patterns, other
   regular repeating patterns) without deviating from the scope of the present invention.
 5 The fuel elements 920a, 920b, 920c, 920d include non-overlapping first (the fuel elements
   920d), second (the fuel elements 920a), third (the fuel elements 920c), and fourth (the fuel
   elements 920b) subsets. The first subset (the fuel elements 920d) are disposed within
   respective grid positions defined by the first/square grid pattern. The second subset (the fuel
   elements 920a) are disposed within respective grid positions defined by the second/triangular
 0 grid pattern. The third subset (the fuel elements 920c) are disposed within respective
   overlapping grid positions that each fall within both the first/square grid pattern and the
   second/triangular grid pattern. The fourth subset (the fuel elements 920b) are not disposed
   within any of the grid positions defined by the first or second grid pattern.
25 As shown in FIG. 19, the peripheral comer fuel elements 920b have a centerline
   920b'-to-centerline 920c' distance of about 8.9 mm, as projected into the row and column
   direction. As shown in FIG. 20, for a 12.6 mm circumscribed fuel element 920b, this provides
   a partial self-spacing plane between the fuel element 920b and the inner, adjacent fuel
   element 920c at the fuel element 920b's 225 degree position. As shown in FIG. 19, the comer
30 of the shroud 940 may be shaped to provide a two-point partial self-spacing plane between
   the fuel element 920c and shroud 940 at about the fuel element 920b 's 0 and 90 degree
   positions. This combination of partial self-spacing planes combine to provide proper self
   spacing of the fuel elements 920b.

    While various exemplary diameters, center-to-center spacing, grid sizes, and other
    dimensions are described with respect to the fuel assembly 910, these exemplary values are
    non-limiting. Rather, those of ordinary skill in the art would understand that a variety of
    alternative values could be used without deviating from the scope of the present invention.

    FIG. 21 illustrates a fuel assembly 1010, which is generally similar to the fuel assembly 910,
    except that the four outer corner fuel elements 920b present in the fuel assembly 910 are
    omitted and/or replaced by guide tubes 1020, 1030.
 0  FIGS. 22-38 illustrate various preferred embodiments of fuel assemblies 1110, 1210, 1310,
    1410, 1510, 1610, 1710, 1810, 1910, 2010 that may be used in place of conventional/standard
    16x16 fuel assemblies of the type described in FIGS. 39-44. Various preferred embodiments
    of these assemblies 1110, 1210, 1310, 1410, 1510, 1610, 1710, 1810, 1910, 2010 are
    designed to replace a conventional 16x16 Combustion Engineering (CE) U0         2 fuel assembly
 5  in a conventional light water, PWR reactor while maintaining the control rod positioning of
    the conventional CE reactor (e.g., a reactor in use as of 2012).
    FIG. 22 illustrates a fuel assembly 1110 according to an alternative preferred embodiment
    that is directed toward a 16x16 fuel assembly design. The assembly 1110 comprises 236 fuel
 '0 elements 1120, which may be similar to or identical to the above-discussed elements 20, such
    that a redundant discussion of the common aspects of the elements 20, 1120 is omitted.
    According to various preferred embodiments, all of the fuel elements 1120 of the fuel
    assembly 1110 are geometrically identical to each other. In the reactor space available for an
    assembly 1110 that replaces a conventional 16x16 assembly (e.g., as described in FIGS. 39
25  44), there is a relatively large initial water gap between adjacent fuel assemblies (e.g., 5.3
    mm), with a fuel assembly pitch of 207.8 mm. As a result, according to various preferred
    embodiments, the assembly 1110 may comprise identical or substantially identical fuel
    elements 1120 arranged in a square array/arrangement in all 16 rows without changing the
    existing positioning of the conventionally-positioned guide tubes and while maintaining the
30  existing rod-to-rod pitch of, for example 0.506 inches (12.852 mm). According to various
    preferred embodiments, the assembly 1110 includes a shroud 1130 that is generally similar to
    the shroud 940, but is sized for a 16x16 fuel assembly. According to various preferred
    embodiments, the shroud thickness is between 0.1 and 2.0 mm, between 0.2 and 0.8 mm,
    between 0.3 and 0.7 mm, and/or approximately 0.48 mm. The relatively thin shroud 1130
                                                      43

    5373C-AU-D1
    provides sufficient spacing for the fuel elements 1120 and water gap while remaining suitably
    adapted for use in place of conventional 16x16 fuel assemblies. According to one or more
    preferred embodiments, the assembly 1110 fits within a reactor that permits a maximum fuel
    assembly envelope/width of 8.134 inches (206.6 mm), with the water gap of 1.2mm. For
 5  example, according to one or more such preferred embodiments in which the fuel element
    pitch and width is 12.852 mm and the shroud 1 130 is 0.48 mm thick, the width of the fuel
    assembly 1110 is 206.95 mm ((12.852mm/element x 16 elements) + (2 x 0.48mm/shroud
    side)), which fits within a 206.6 mm envelope.
 0  As shown in FIG. 22, the assembly 1110 includes five guide tubes 1140 for control rods. As
    shown in FIG. 23, each guide tube 1140 comprises an inner guide tube portion 1 140a and an
    outer spacer ring portion 1140b. The inner and outer portions 1140a, 1140b may be integrally
    formed, or may be separately formed and attached to each other. According to various
    preferred embodiments, an inner diameter of the inner guide tube portion 1 140a is slightly
 5  larger than an outside diameter of control rod tube to be inserted therein. For example,
    according to various preferred embodiments, the inside diameter of the inner guide tube
    portion 1140a is about 0.9 inches, and is configured to accommodate therein a control rod
    that has an outside diameter of 0.816 inches and contains burnable absorber/poison material
    (e.g., having a diameter of 0.737 inches).
 10
    As shown in FIG. 23, the outer spacer ring portion 1140b has an outer diameter that abuts the
    circles (shown in FIG. 23) defined by the outer diameter of the fuel elements 1120 and define
    the outer extents of the fuel elements 1120 over the spiral twist of the fuel elements 1120. For
    example, in an preferred embodiment in which the fuel elements 1120 have an outer diameter
25  of 0.506 inches and the guide tube 1140 has an outer diameter of 1.094 inches, the
    circumscribed circles have a 0.506 inch diameter and are centered on the centerline position
    of the grid/array position of the respective fuel elements 1120. Consequently, the eight fuel
    elements 1120 that are in the rows and columns adjacent to the guide tube 1140 abut the
    guide tube 1140 at a variety of positions along the axial length of each fuel element 1120
30  (e.g., one fuel-element-to-guide - tube contact point for each of the four ribs for each full 360
    degree twist of the fuel element 1120). FIGS. 24 and 25 illustrate the cross-sections in which
    different combinations of four adjacent fuel elements 1120 abut the guide tube 1140. If the
    cross-section illustrated in FIG. 23 is considered a home or 0 degree position, FIG. 24
    illustrates a cross-section in a plane in which the fuel elements 1120 are rotated/twisted
                                                     44

   5373C-AU-D1
   clockwise by about 18' (i.e., a plane that is offset from the home/0 position plane by about
   1/20 of a full 360' twist of the element 1120). Similarly, FIG. 25 illustrates a cross-section
   that is offset from the home/0 position plane by a 72' twist of the elements 1120 and about
   1/5 of a full 360' twist of the element 120.
 5
   FIGS. 26-30 illustrate a fuel assembly 1210 according to an alternative preferred
   embodiment. The assembly 1210 comprises a central 14x14 array of fuel elements 1220c,
   1220d and guide tubes 1240 that are similar or identical to the position, shape, and structure
   of the central 14x14 array of fuel elements 1120 and guide tubes 1 140 of the assembly 1110.
 0 However, the number and positions of the outermost peripheral ring (i.e., in rows 1 and 16
   and columns 1 and 16) of fuel elements 1220a in the assembly 1210 differs from that of the
   assembly 1110. Instead of being arranged in grid positions within a square 16x16 array, the
   outer peripheral ring of fuel elements 1220, the fuel elements 1220a are arranged so as to
   form equilateral triangles with the fuel elements 1220c in the same manner as described
 5 above for the comparable 17x17 fuel assembly 910. Also as in the assembly 910, as best
   illustrated in FIG. 30, the assembly 1210 includes corner fuel elements 1220b and a shroud
   1230 that are positioned relative to the other fuel elements such that the fuel elements 1220b
   contact the shroud 1230 at least two different positions (or a continuous arc) and contact a
   comer one of the fuel elements 1220c so as to provide three contact points to maintain the
 0 fuel elements 1220b in their proper positions.
   As shown in FIG. 26, each of the fuel elements 1220a, b, c, d may be identical or
   substantially identical to each other according to various non-limiting preferred
   embodiments, and may be identical to or substantially identical to the fuel elements 20. As
25 shown in FIG. 26, according to various preferred embodiments, the assembly 1210 comprises
   232 fuel elements 1220a, b, c, d.
   If the cross-sectional plane illustrated in FIG. 27 is considered a home/0' plane, the cross
   section illustrated in FIG. 28 corresponds to a cross-sectional plane that is offset from the
30 home/0' plane by 30' of twist in the elements 1220 (i.e., 1/12 of a complete 360' twist of the
   elements 1220). Similarly, FIG. 29 corresponds to a cross-sectional plane that is offset from
   the home/0' plane by 60' of twist in the elements 1220 (i.e., 1/6 of a complete 3600 twist of
   the elements 1220). Similarly, FIG. 30 corresponds to a cross-sectional plane that is offset
                                                    45

    5373C-AU-D1
    from the home/0' plane by 450 of twist in the elements 1220 (i.e., 1/8 of a complete twist of
    the elements 1220).
    According to various preferred embodiments, the use of a triangular grid along the outer
 5  perimeter of the assembly 1210 facilitates the use of (a) a thicker, stronger shroud 1230 than
    is possible according to various preferred embodiments in which all elements are disposed in
    a square 16x16 grid/array (e.g., one or more preferred embodiments of the assembly 1110
    illustrated in FIG. 22), and/or (b) a larger water gap. According to various preferred
    embodiments, a thickness of the shroud 1230 is between 0.4 and 4 mm, between 0.4 and 3
 0  mm, between 0.5 and 2.5 mm, between 1 and 2 mm, and/or about 2 mm.
    According to various preferred embodiments, all of the fuel elements 1220a, b, c, d of the
    fuel assembly 1210 are geometrically identical to each other, and may be identical to or
    substantially identical to the elements 20.
 5
    FIG. 31 illustrates a fuel assembly 1310 which is generally identical to the fuel assembly
    1210, except that a corner structure 1350 is disposed outside of and attached to the shroud
    1230. As shown in FIG. 31, the comer structure 1350 has a cross-sectional shape that
    generally follows the curved contour of the corner of the shroud 1230 and fits within a square
 '0 that would be defined by the shroud 1230 if the corners of the shroud 1230 were not curved.
    According to various preferred embodiments, the corner structure 1350 extends over the full
    axial length of the fuel assembly 1310 (or a full axial length of the fuel elements 1220 and/or
    shroud 1230). Alternatively, the comer structure 1350 may be axially shorter than the
    assembly 1310, shroud 1230, and/or fuel elements 1220 (including fuel elements 1220a, b, c,
25  and d). The corner structure 1350 may retain the cross-sectional shape illustrated in FIG. 31
    over its full axial length, or the cross-sectional shape may vary over the axial length of the
    corner structure 1350.
    Use of the comer structure 1350 may enable the fuel assembly 1310 to take advantage of the
30  available space disposed outside of the shroud 1230.
    FIG. 32 illustrates a fuel assembly 1410 that is substantially similar to the fuel assembly
    1310, except that a corner structure 1450 of the assembly 1410 is disposed inside of a shroud
                                                      46

   1430 of the assembly 1410, as opposed to outside of the shroud 1230 as is shown with respect
   to the assembly 1310. The comer structure 1450 is attached to the inner corner of the
   shroud 1430. The shroud 1430 is generally similar to the shroud 1230, except that the comers
   of the shroud 1430 are sharper (i.e., less curved/chamfered) than in the shroud 1230.
 5
   As shown in FIG. 32, an inner contour of the corner structure 1450 is partially-cylindrical so
   as to abut the fuel element 1220b at multiple places (or continuously over an arc defined by
   the partial cylinder). According to various preferred embodiments, the partial cylinder shape
   covers about a 90 degree arc and has a radius that matches the radius of the fuel element
 0 1220b so as to maintain the fuel element 1220b in its correct position.
   Use of the comer structure 1450 enables the fuel assembly 1310 to take advantage of the
   available space disposed inside one or more of the corners of the shroud 1430.
 5 FIG. 33 illustrates a fuel assembly 1510 that is substantially similar to the fuel assembly
   1410, except that a partially-cylindrical inner surface a corner structure 1550 of the assembly
   1410 extends over a larger arc A than the corner structure 1450 of the assembly 1410.
   According to various preferred embodiments, the arc A is between 90' and 310' degrees,
   between 120' and 310' degrees, between 150' and 310' degrees, between 180' and 3100
 0 degrees, and/or about 2700. As shown in FIG. 33, according to various preferred
   embodiments, the comer structure 1450 also abuts the adjacent fuel elements 1220a so as to
   maintain the fuel elements 1220a in their correct positions.
   Use of the comer structure 1550 may enable the fuel assembly 1510 to take advantage of the
25 available space disposed inside one or more of the corners of the shroud 1430.
   FIG. 34 illustrates a fuel assembly 1610 that is substantially similar to the fuel assembly
   1510, except that comer fuel elements in the outer perimeter are omitted entirely (e.g., the
   fuel element 1220b present in the assembly 1510 is omitted), and the corner structure 1650 is
30 expanded to take up the space that would otherwise be taken by such a comer fuel element
   1220b. As shown in FIG. 34, the comer structure 1650 abuts two adjacent fuel elements
   1220a and the adjacent fuel element 1220c to maintain these three elements 1220a, c in their
   correct positions.

    Use of the comer structure 1650 may enable the fuel assembly 1610 to take advantage of the
    available space disposed inside one or more of the corners of the shroud 1430.
    FIG. 35 illustrates a fuel assembly 1710 that is substantially similar to the fuel assembly
 5  1210, except that the corner fuel element 1220b of the assembly 1210 is replaced with a
    comer structure 1750. According to various preferred embodiments, the structure 1750 is
    tubular and has a diameter (e.g., 15 mm) that causes it to abut multiple points on the shroud
    1230 and the corner fuel element 1220c to keep the corner fuel element 1220c in its correct
    position. The comer structure 1750 may comprise a tube that is helically wrapped with
 0  material such a wire that is attached to the tube (e.g., via welding) so that the comer structure
    maintains the adjacent fuel elements in their correct position in the same or similar way that
    the spiral twists of adjacent fuel elements do so, as discussed above.
    Use of the comer structure 1750 may enable the fuel assembly 1710 to take advantage of the
 5  available space disposed inside one or more of the corners of the shroud 1230.
    FIG. 36 illustrates a fuel assembly 1810 that is substantially similar to the fuel assembly
    1610, except that the corner structure 1850 has three concave, partially-cylindrically shaped
    surfaces, one abutting each of the adjacent fuel elements 1220a and adjacent corner fuel
 '0 element 1220c. A radius and position of the three concave, partially-cylindrically shaped
    surfaces matches the radii and positions of the mating fuel elements 1220a, 1220c such that
    the corner structure 1810 abuts the fuel elements 1220a, 1220c over extended arcs A, B, C.
    The extended arcs A, B, C of contact maintain the abutting fuel elements 1220a, 1220c in
    their correct positions.
25
    As shown in FIG. 36, the comer structure 1850 may define a corner of the shroud 1830. For
    example, the shroud 1830 may comprise plates 1830a whose ends connect to the comer
    structures 1850. Alternatively, the shroud 1830 may be similar to or identical to the shroud
    1230, and the comer structure 1850 may be disposed inside of and mounted to the shroud
30  1830.
    Use of the comer structure 1850 may enable the fuel assembly 1810 to take advantage of the
    available space disposed inside one or more of the corners of the assembly 1810.

    1750, 1850 may comprise one or more of a burnable poison, steel, alloys or ceramics of
    zirconium, and/or uranium, and/or plutonium, and/or thorium and/or none of these materials.
 0  According to various preferred embodiments, the corner structure 1350, 1450, 1550, 1650,
    1750, 1850 may be solid. According to various preferred embodiments, the corner structure
    1350, 1450, 1550, 1650, 1750, 1850 may comprise a hollow structure (e.g., made of tubular
    steel and/or zirconium metals or alloys) that may be (1) open-ended and empty to permit flow
    therethrough, (2) closed-ended and empty, and/or (3) closed-ended and partially or fully filled
 5  with material (e.g., oxide fuel, burnable poison, etc. in pellet or other form)).
    Although the comer structures 1350, 1450, 1550, 1650, 1750, 1850 and associated shrouds

 '0 comer structures 1350, 1450, 1550, 1650, 1750, 1850 and associated shroud configurations
    could alternatively be applied to the above-discussed fuel assemblies 910, 1010 that are
    designed for use in place of conventional 17x 17 fuel assemblies without deviating from the
    scope of the present invention.
25  FIG. 37 illustrates a fuel assembly 1910 that is substantially similar to the fuel assembly
    1210, except that both the outermost ring of fuel elements 1920a and the second outermost
    ring of fuel elements 1920b (rather than just the outer ring as in the assembly 1210) are
    shifted inwardly into an equilateral triangle grid array with the third outermost ring of
    elements 1920c. The third outermost ring of elements 1920c and the central 1Ox10 array of
30  elements 1920d (collectively a central 12x12 array of elements 1920c, 1920d) are arranged in
    a square grid/array.
    As shown in FIG. 37, fuel elements are omitted from the comers of the outermost ring of fuel

    assembly in which each grid position within the outermost ring is occupied by a fuel element

    similarly omitted from the second outermost ring of elements 1920b relative to the number of
    fuel elements in an assembly in which each grid position within the second outermost ring is
 5  occupied by a fuel element (e.g., as illustrated in FIG. 22 with respect to assembly 1110). A
    remaining fuel element 1920b' of the second outermost ring of fuel elements 1920b is
    disposed at each of the corners of the second outermost ring of fuel elements 1920b.
    According to various preferred embodiments, spacers and/or corner structures may be added
 0  to help maintain the correct positions of the fuel elements 1920a that are adjacent to the
    comers and the fuel elements 1920b'.
    According to various preferred embodiments, use of the equilateral triangle spacing in two
    outer rings of elements (as opposed to just one ring as in the assembly of FIG. 26) provides
 5  additional space within the envelope available for the fuel assembly 1910. Such space may be
    used, for example, for a thicker shroud 1930 or a larger water gap.
    According to various preferred embodiments, all of the fuel elements 1920a, 1920b, 1920b',
    1920c, 1920d of the fuel assembly 1910 are geometrically identical to each other, and may be
