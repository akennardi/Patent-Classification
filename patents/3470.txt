   Background Art
   The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an enveloped, partially double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
 5 virus of the Hepadnavirus family (Hepadnaviridae).Its genome contains 4 overlapping
   reading frames: the precore/core gene; the polymerase gene; the L, M, and S genes, which
   encode for the 3 envelope proteins; and the X gene.
   Upon infection, the partially double-stranded DNA genome (the relaxed circular DNA;
   rcDNA) is converted to a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus of the
10 host cell and the viral mRNAs are transcribed. Once encapsidated, the pregenomic RNA
   (pgRNA), which also codes for core protein and Pol, serves as the template for reverse
   transcription, which regenerates the partially dsDNA genome (rcDNA) in the nucleocapsid.
   HBV has caused epidemics in parts of Asia and Africa, and it is endemic in China. HBV has
   infected approximately 2 billion people worldwide of which approximately 350 million
15 people have developed chronic infections. The virus causes the disease hepatitis B and
   chronic infection is correlated with a strongly increased risk for the development cirrhosis
   and hepatocellular carcinoma.
   Transmission of hepatitis B virus results from exposure to infectious blood or body fluids,
   while viral DNA has been detected in the saliva, tears, and urine of chronic carriers with
20 high titer DNA in serum.
   An effective and well-tolerated vaccine exists, but direct treatment options are currently
   limited to interferon and the following antivirals; tenofovir, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir
   and telbivudine.
   In addition, heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs) were identified as a class of HBV
25 inhibitors in tissue culture and animal models (Weber et al., Antiviral Res. 54: 69-78).
   W02013/006394, published on January 10, 2013, relates to a subclass of Sulphamoyl
   arylamides active against HBV. W02013/096744, published on June 26, 2013 relates to
   compounds active against HBV.
   In addition, W02014/033170 and W02014/033176, published on March 6, 2014 relate
30 further compounds active against HBV.

                                                    -2
   Amongst the problems which HBV direct antivirals may encounter are toxicity,
   mutagenicity, lack of selectivity, poor efficacy, poor bioavailability, low solubility and
   difficulty of synthesis.
   There is a need for additional HBV inhibitors that may overcome at least one of these
 5 disadvantages or that have additional advantages such as increased potency or an increased
   safety window.
   It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the
   disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.
   Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered
10 as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general
   knowledge in the field.

   Definitions
   Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the
   words "comprise", "comprising", and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as
25 opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of "including, but not
   limited to".
   The term "C1.3alkyl" as a group or part of a group refers to a hydrocarbyl radical of Formula
   CnH 2n+1 wherein n is a number ranging from 1 to 3. In case C1.3alkyl is coupled to a further
30 radical, it refers to a Formula C11H2.. C1.3alkyl groups comprise from 1 to 3 carbon atoms,
   more preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms. C1.3alkyl includes all linear, or branched alkyl groups
   with between 1 and 3 carbon atoms, and thus includes such as for example methyl, ethyl,
   n-propyl, and i-propyl.
   C14alkyl   as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated
35 hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as the group defined for
   C1.3alkyl and butyl and the like.

                                                  -10
   C1.6alkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated
   hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as the groups defined for
   C14alkyl  and pentyl, hexyl, 2-methylbutyl and the like.
   As used herein, the term "3-7 membered saturated ring" means saturated cyclic hydrocarbon
 5 with 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 carbon atoms and is generic to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl,
   cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl.
   Such saturated ring optionally contains one or more heteroatoms, such that at least one
   carbon atom is replaced by a heteroatom selected from N, 0 and S, in particular from N and
   0. Examples include oxetane, tetrahydro-2H-pyranyl, piperidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl,
10 morpholinyl, thiolane 1,1-dioxide and pyrrolidinyl.Preferred are saturated cyclic
   hydrocarbon with 3 or 4 carbon atoms and 1 oxygen atom. Examples include oxetane,and
   tetrahydrofuranyl.
   It should be noted that different isomers of the various heterocycles may exist within the
   definitions as used throughout the specification. For example, pyrrolyl may be
15 1H-pyrrolyl or 2H-pyrrolyl.
   The term halo and halogen aregeneric to Fluoro, Chloro, Bromo or Iodo. Preferred halogens
   are Fluoro and Chloro.
   It should also be noted that the radical positions on any molecular moiety used in the
   definitions may be anywhere on such moiety as long as it is chemically stable. For instance
20 pyridyl includes 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl and 4-pyridyl; pentyl includes 1-pentyl, 2-pentyl and
   3-pentyl.
   Positions indicated on phenyl (e.g. ortho, meta and/orpara)are indicated relative to the
   bond connecting the phenyl to the main structure. An example with regard to the position of
   R1, any location is indicated relative to the nitrogen (*) connected to the main structure:
    R6 N      0
         0      /X       H         R,

                                                  -11
   When any variable (e.g. halogen or CI 3 alkyl) occurs more than one time in any constituent,
   each definition is independent.
   For therapeutic use, the salts of the compounds of Formula (IA) are those wherein the
   counter ion is pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable. However, salts having a
 5 pharmaceutically unacceptable counter ion may also find use, for example, in the
   preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound of Formula (IA). All
   salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the
   present invention.
   The pharmaceutically acceptable or physiologically tolerable addition salt forms which the
10 compounds of the present invention are able to form can conveniently be prepared using the
   appropriate acids, such as, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g.
   hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid; sulfuric; hemisulphuric, nitric; phosphoric and the like
   acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, aspartic, dodecylsulphuric, heptanoic,
   hexanoic, nicotinic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic, malonic, succinic,
15 maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic,
   p-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, p-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids.
   Conversely said acid addition salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate
   base into the free base form.
   The term "salts" also comprises the hydrates and the solvent addition forms that the
20 compounds of the present invention are able to form. Examples of such forms are e.g.
   hydrates, alcoholates and the like.
   The present compounds may also exist in their tautomeric forms. For example, tautomeric
   forms of amide (-C(=O)-NH-) groups are iminoalcohols (-C(OH)=N-). Tautomeric forms,
   although not explicitly indicated in the structural formulae represented herein, are intended
25 to be included within the scope of the present invention.
   The term stereochemically isomeric forms of compounds of the present invention, as used
   hereinbefore, defines all possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded by the
   same sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not
   interchangeable, which the compounds of the present invention may possess. Unless
30 otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound encompasses the
   mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms which said compound may possess.
   Said mixture may contain all diastereomers and/or enantiomers of the basic molecular
   structure of said compound. All stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of the

                                                   -12
   present invention both in pure form or in admixture with each other are intended to be
   embraced within the scope of the present invention.
   Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates as mentioned herein are
   defined as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the
 5 same basic molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates. In particular, the term
   'stereoisomerically pure' concerns compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric
   excess of at least 80% (i. e. minimum 90% of one isomer and maximum 10% of the other
   possible isomers) up to a stereoisomeric excess of 100% (i.e. 100% of one isomer and none
   of the other), more in particular, compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess
10 of 90% up to 100%, even more in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 94% up to
   100% and most in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 97% up to 100%. The terms
   'enantiomerically pure' and 'diastereomerically pure' should be understood in a similar way,
   but then having regard to the enantiomeric excess, respectively the diastereomeric excess of
   the mixture in question.
15 Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates of this invention may be
   obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For instance, enantiomers may be
   separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with
   optically active acids or bases. Examples thereof are tartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid,
   ditoluoyltartaric acid and camphosulfonic acid. Alternatively, enantiomers may be separated
20 by chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure stereochemically
   isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric
   forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs
   stereospecifically. Preferably, if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be
   synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously
25 employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.
   The diastereomeric forms of Formula (IA) can be obtained separately by conventional
   methods. Appropriate physical separation methods that may advantageously be employed
   are, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column chromatography.
   The present invention is also intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring on the
30 present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but
   different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of
   Hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Isotopes of carbon include C-13 and C-14.

   tautomeric form thereof with a Formula (IA), (I), (Ta), (Ib),as represented in the synthesis of
 5 compounds section and of which the activity is displayed in Table 1.
   In a further aspect, the present invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition comprising
   a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of Formula (IA) as
   specified herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A prophylactically effective
   amount in this context is an amount sufficient to prevent HBV infection in subjects being at
10 risk of being infected. A therapeutically effective amount in this context is an amount
   sufficient to stabilize HBV infection, to reduce HBV infection, or to eradicate HBV
   infection, in infected subjects. In still a further aspect, this invention relates to a process of
   preparing a pharmaceutical composition as specified herein, which comprises intimately
   mixing a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier with a therapeutically or prophylactically
15 effective amount of a compound of Formula (IA), as specified herein.
   Therefore, the compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be
   formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate
   compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically
   administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an
20 effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active
   ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,
   which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired
   for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form
   suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral
25 injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual
   pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols
   and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs,
   emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants,
   binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets.
30 Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most
   advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are
   employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at
   least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included.
   Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline
35 solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions

                                                   -18
   may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the
   like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations intended to be converted,
   shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous
   administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a
 5 suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor
   proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin.
   The compounds of the present invention may also be administered via oral inhalation or
   insufflation in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry powder using any art-known
   delivery system.
10
   It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions
   in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form
   as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit
   containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired
15 therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such
   unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills,
   suppositories, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and
   segregated multiples thereof.
20 The compounds of Formula (IA) are active as inhibitors of the HBV replication cycle and
   can be used in the treatment and prophylaxis of HBV infection or diseases associated with
   HBV. The latter include progressive liver fibrosis, inflammation and necrosis leading to
   cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
   Due to their antiviral properties, particularly their anti-HBV properties, the compounds of
25 Formula (IA) or any subgroup thereof, are useful in the inhibition of the HBV replication
   cycle, in particular in the treatment of warm-blooded animals, in particular humans, infected
   with HBV, and for the prophylaxis of HBV infections. The present invention furthermore
   relates to a method of treating a warm-blooded animal, in particular human, infected by
   HBV, or being at risk of infection by HBV, said method comprising the administration of a
30 therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (IA).
   The compounds of Formula (IA), as specified herein, may therefore be used as a medicine,
   in particular as medicine to treat or prevent HBV infection. Said use as a medicine or
   method of treatment comprises the systemic administration to HBV infected subjects or to
   subjects susceptible to HBV infection of an amount effective to combat the conditions
35 associated with HBV infection or an amount effective to prevent HBV infection.

                                                  -19
   The present invention also relates to the use of the present compounds in the manufacture of
   a medicament for the treatment or the prevention of HBV infection.
   In general it is contemplated that an antiviral effective daily amount would be from about
   0.01 to about 50 mg/kg, or about 0.01 to about 30 mg/kgbody weight. It may be appropriate
 5 to administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals
   throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example,
   containing about 1 to about 500 mg, or about I to about 300 mg, or about I to about 100 mg,
   or about 2 to about 50 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.
   The present invention also concerns combinations of a compound of Formula (IA) or any
10 subgroup thereof, as specified herein with other anti-HBV agents. The term "combination"
   may relate to a product or kit containing (a) a compound of Formula (IA), as specified
   above, and (b) at least one other compound capable of treating HBV infection (herein
   designated as anti-HBV agent), as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or
   sequential use in treatment of HBV infections. In an embodiment, the invention concerns
15 combination of a compound of Formula (IA) or any subgroup thereof with at least one anti
   HBV agent. In a particular embodiment, the invention concerns combination of a compound
   of Formula (IA) or any subgroup thereof with at least two anti-HBV agents. In a particular
   embodiment, the invention concerns combination of a compound of Formula (IA) or any
   subgroup thereof with at least three anti-HBV agents. In a particular embodiment, the
20 invention concerns combination of a compound of Formula (IA) or any subgroup thereof
   with at least four anti-HBV agents.
   The term anti-HBV agent also includes compounds capable of treating HBV infection via
   immunomodulation. Examples of immunomodulators are interferon-a (IFN-c), pegylated
   interferon-a or stimulants of the innate immune system such as Toll-like receptor 7 and/or 8
25 agonists. One embodiment of the present invention relates to combinations of a compound
   of Formula (IA) or any subgroup thereof, as specified herein with an immunomodulating
   compound, more specifically a Toll-like receptor 7 and/or 8 agonist.
   The combination of previously known anti-HBV agents, such as interferon-a (IFN-a),
   pegylated interferon-a, 3TC, adefovir or a combination thereof, and, a compound of
30 Formula (IA) or any subgroup thereof can be used as a medicine in a combination therapy.

   The synthesis of compounds of general Formula (I) can be performed as outlined in Scheme
 5 1. Each R independently represents lower alkyl, preferably C1-C3alkyl and even more
   preferred methyl or ethyl. A carboxylic acid of general formula (a) can be coupled with an
   aniline of general formula (b) using a peptide coupling reagent like for example HATU in
   the presence of an organic amine base such as TEA or DIPEA. The resulting compound of
   general formula (c) can be reacted with an oxalyl chloride monoalkyl ester of general
10 formula (d) in the presence of a Lewis acid like for example AlCl 3 to provide a compound of
   general formula (f). Alternatively, compounds of general formula (f) can be obtained by
   inversion of the order of the aforementioned reaction steps, in particular by reaction of a
   carboxylic acid of general formula (a) with oxalyl chloride monoalkyl ester of general
   formula (d) in the presence of a Lewis acid like for example AlCl 3 to provide a compound of
15 general formula (e), followed by coupling of (e) with an aniline of general formula (b) using
   a peptide coupling reagent like for example HATU in the presence of a organic amine base
   such as TEA or DIPEA. Reaction of a compound of general formula (f) with an amine of
   general formula (g) in a suitable solvent such as for example EtOH, provides a compound of
   general formula (I). Alternatively, compounds of general formula (I) can be obtained from a
20 compound of general formula (f) in a two-step procedures that involves hydrolysis of the
   ester moiety of a compound of general formula (f) with an inorganic base of general formula

  formula (i) with an amine of general formula (g) using a peptide coupling reagent like for
  example HATU in the presence of a organic amine base such as TEA or DIPEA. Similarly
  as described for the synthesis of compounds of general Formula (I) inScheme 1, the

   The synthesis of compounds of general formula (I) can also be performed as outlined in
   Scheme 2.Each R' independently represents lower alkyl, preferably C1-C3alkyl and even
   more preferred methyl or ethyl. A carboxylic ester of general formula (j) can be reacted with
   an oxalyl chloride monoalkyl ester of general formula (d) in the presence of a Lewis acid
 5 like for example AlCl 3 to provide a compound of general formula (k). Hydrolysis of (k) with
   an inorganic base of general formula (h) like NaOH provides the corresponding alpha-keto
   acid of general formula (m). Compounds of general formula (n) can be obtained by coupling
   of (m) with an amine of general formula (g) using a peptide coupling reagent like for
   example HATU in the presence of a organic amine base such as TEA or DIPEA.
10 Alternatively, compounds of general formula (n) can be obtained from carboxylic ester of
   general formula (j) in a two-step one-pot procedure that includes reaction of (j) with oxalyl
   chloride, followed by treatment of the intermediate of general formula (o) with an amine of
   general formula (g). A compound of general formula (n) can be hydrolysed with an
   inorganic base of general formula (h) like for example NaOH. The resulting carboxylic acid
15 of general formula (p) can be coupled with an aniline of general formula (b) using a peptide
   coupling reagent like for example HATU in the presence of a organic amine base such as
   TEA or DIPEA, to provide compounds of general formula (I).Similarly as described for the
   synthesis of compounds of general Formula (I) from a compound of general formula (p) and
   aniline (b) shown inScheme 2, the synthesis of compounds of general formula IA can be
20 performed from aniline (bA) and a compound of general formula (p) as described in Scheme
   2A.
   Alternatively, intermediates of the general formula (cA) and compounds of the general
   formula (IA) can be synthesized as depicted in scheme 3A. In this case a compound of
   general formula (j) or (n) is reacted with an aniline of general formula (bA) under influence
25 of a base like lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LiHMDS), resulting in compound of general
   formula (cA) and (IA) respectively.

   General procedure LCMS methods
 5 The High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) measurement was performed using
   a LC pump, a diode-array (DAD) or a UV detector and a column as specified in the
   respective methods. If necessary, additional detectors were included (see table of methods
   below).
   Flow from the column was brought to the Mass Spectrometer (MS) which was configured
10 with an atmospheric pressure ion source. It is within the knowledge of the skilled person to
   set the tune parameters (e.g. scanning range, dwell time...) in order to obtain ions allowing
   the identification of the compound's nominal monoisotopic molecular weight (MW). Data
   acquisition was performed with appropriate software.
   Compounds are described by their experimental retention times (Rt) and ions. If not
15 specified differently in the table of data, the reported molecular ion corresponds to the
   [M+H]* (protonated molecule) and/or [M-H] -(deprotonated molecule). In case the
   compound was not directly ionizable the type of adduct is specified (i.e. [M+NH 4 ]*,
   [M+HCOO]-, etc...). All results were obtained with experimental uncertainties that are
   commonly associated with the method used.

   MgSO4 (21 g, 174.5 mmol) and CH 2Cl 2(200 mL) was stirred at 28'C for 24 hours. The
   mixture was filtrated. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo and the obtained residue
   (63.1 g) was used directly in the next step.The obtained residue (63 g) was dissolved in
25 acetonitrile (600 mL). Trifluoroacetic acid (45 g, 394 mmol), potassium hydrogenfluoride
   (22.5 g, 288 mmol) and DMF (60 mL) were added to the mixture at 00 C. The mixture was
   stirred at 0' for 10 minutes. (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (77 g, 541 mmol) was added to
   the reaction mixture and the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 12 h. Saturated
   aqueous Na 2 CO 3 (200 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred for 5 min. The mixture

10 Biological examples - anti-HBV activity of compounds of Formula (IA)
   The anti-HBV activity was measured using a stable transfected cell line, HepG2.2.15. This
   cell line was described to secrete relatively consistent high levels of HBV virion particles,
   which have been shown to cause both acute and chronic infection and disease in
   chimpanzees.
15 For the antiviral, assay cells were treated twice for three days with serially diluted
   compound in 96-well plates in duplicate. After 6 days of treatment the antiviral activity was
   determined by quantification of purified HBV DNA from secreted virions using realtime
   PCR and an HBV specific primer set and probe.
   The anti HBV activity was also measured using the HepG2.117 cell line, a stable, inducibly
20 HBV producing cell line, which replicates HBV in the absence of doxicycline (Tet-off
   system). For the antiviral assay, HBV replication was induced, followed by a treatment with
   serially diluted compound in 96-well plates in duplicate. After 3 days of treatment, the
   antiviral activity was determined by quantification of intracellular HBV DNA using realtime
   PCR and an HBV specific primer set and probe.
25 Cytotoxicity of the compounds was tested using HepG2 cells, incubated for 4 days in the
   presence of compounds. The viability of the cells was assessed using a Resazurin assay.
   Results are displayed in Table 1.
