         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention relates to a method for preparing a pharmaceutical
 5 intermediate which belongs to the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates
   to cholic acid 3,7,12-trioxy-5p-cholanic acid synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         3,7,12-trioxy-5p-cholanic   acid is a synthesis derivative of cholic acid that
   promotes bile secretion and increases the water content in the bile but does not
10 increase the solid content, thereby promoting secretion of a large amount of bile with
   lower viscosity, preventing from infection on ascending biliary tract. It also excludes
   the stone and promotes the digestion and absorption of fat, but does not increases the
   absorption of vitamin K. Most of the existing synthesis methods using the process that
   the biliary paste with taurin and glycocholic acid is heated and boiled with sodium
15 hydroxide solution, hydrolysis for 16h, acidified to pH3, the gray-brown lumps is
   filtered out of the water, boiled in hot water for 10min , cooled, filtered, washed with
   water, dried, dried at 60-70 'C to give cholic acid. The cholic acid is put into acetic
   acid and sodium acetate solution, passes into the chlorine at 10-20 'C until the white
   solid all precipitated, washed with a large number of distilled water, filters, dries, gets
20 the crude hydrogenic acid, refined by ethanol to get products. This synthesis method
   requires the use of sodium hydroxide solution and chlorine as reactants, due to strong
   corrosion of sodium hydroxide solution, the corrosion resistance of the equipment
   requirements are higher, and chlorine is a toxic gas, the health of synthesis operators
   get greater harm, the risk coefficient of the synthesis process is higher, and the
25 reaction time is longer, more than 16h, and the synthesis method is complicated and
   the final yield is not very high. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new synthesis
   method.
