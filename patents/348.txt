Patent Abstract
Trailering Outboard Trim Tilt shock absorbing support
    The present application relates to method and apparatus for trailering an outboard engine providing
shock dampening and stabilizing high horsepower outboard motors which utilize a hydraulic tilt trim
mechanism. In particular, the present application relates method and apparatus for stabilizing and
providing shock absorption of outboard motors when in inclined positions during trailering of the boat
and motor.
 The problem experienced with trailering outboard motors is resolved by this cited invention. The
trailering of outboard motors on boats and heavy high power (4,6 and 8-cylinder Outboard engine
versions) outboard motors in particular, is the risk of damaging the outboard motor, trim tilt hydraulics
and lower unit gear case due to road shock. The cylindrical rubber material spring provides a shock
absorber function between the Outboard and the tilt trim thereby providing absorption of transferred
road bumps, vibration, shock and cushioning the outboard and the lower unit of the outboard motor
during trailering. The specific length of the cited spring enables the outboard to be supported at the
optimum height from the road surface for trailering. This is particularly evident when trailering high
horsepower Outboards with 25" and 30" shaft lengths which require greater elevation from the road
surface to be safely transported.

Description:
Trailering Outboard Trim Tilt shock absorbing support
 1. Field of the Invention
     The present application relates to method and apparatus for trailering an outboard engine providing
shock dampening and stabilizing high horsepower outboard motors which utilize a hydraulic tilt trim
mechanism. In particular, the present application relates method and apparatus for stabilizing and
providing shock absorption of outboard motors when in inclined positions during trailering of the boat
and motor.
 The invention resolves problems experienced with trailering outboard motors is resolved by this cited
invention. The trailering of outboard motors on boats and heavy high power (4,6 and 8-cylinder
Outboard engine versions) outboard motors in particular, is the risk of damaging the outboard motor,
trim tilt hydraulics and lower unit gear case due to road shock. The cylindrical rubber material spring
provides a shock absorber function between the Outboard and the tilt trim thereby providing
absorption of transferred road bumps, vibration, shock and cushioning the outboard and the lower unit
of the outboard motor during trailering. The specific length of the cited spring enables the outboard to
be supported at the optimum height from the road surface for trailering. This is particularly evident
when trailering high horsepower Outboards with 25" and 30" shaft lengths which require greater
elevation from the road surface to be safely transported.
The embodiment of the invention cited is a novel and inventive step.
      This invention relates to supports for high horsepower marine outboard motors when in inclination
to raise the gearbox away from the road surface while trailering boats upon which the outboard motors
are mounted and more particularly, to an outboard motor support provided with a built-in shock
absorbing/dampening function and can be installed and removed as required. In a preferred
embodiment the outboard motor support of this invention is characterized by an injection molded
cylinder of Rubber or EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) encasing which fits over the trim tilt
piston and forms a high-density rubber shock absorption material between the outboard and the trim
tilt mechanism.
      For the larger high horse power outboards, the shock absorption capability of the invention is
enhanced through the incorporation of a steel spring encased within the rubber casing which is
comprised of a locating lug at the top of the tubular spring and a central channel which is hollow to
enable the insertion of the tilt trim ram piston. The rubber hardness or Shore Hardness is a measure of
the resistance a material has to indentation. For heavy outboards which can weigh in excess of 354kgs
(780LBS) the rubber hardness selected is 75shoreA and increased spring wire thickness and resistive
spring rate to provide dampening support to the outboard while inclined on a boat trailer. Smaller and
lighter outboards can be matched with a softer rubber compound harness and softer spring rate due to
the reduced mass required to be supported. The spring provides a firm support which absorbs vibration
and prevents bouncing for the outboard during trailering. The invention spring length accommodates
heavy high output outboard motors which have either long (25") or extra-long (30") shafts to be
positioned in an inclined position which provides sufficient ground clearance of the outboard gearbox

skeg to the road surface. While trailering a boat with an outboard engine if not correctly supported the
gear box skeg could make contact with the road surface, gutters, speed bumps and ramps. In the event
the outboard skeg clearance is compromised during trailering the outboard gearbox and skeg may
make contact with the road structure resulting in considerable damage. The safety risks to the towing
vehicle and fellow road users in the event the outboard gearbox skeg makes contact with the road
surface highlights the need for correctly supported outboards which this invention cites.
      One of the problems which is realized in the trailering of outboard motors and boats and heavy
outboard motors in particular, is the risk of damaging the motor due to road shock. Outboard motors
are mounted on the transom at the rear of a boat and considerable pivoting pressure and torque is
exerted on the transom, outboard and tilt trim mechanism during trailering due to the weight of the
motor. This torque and bouncing momentum frequently causes damage to the tilt trim mechanism,
Outboard transom fixture and can result in the tilt trim mechanism, outboard clamp bracket and pivot
bolt such that operation of the outboard in a normal manner is rendered inoperable and dangerous.
In the act of trailering, the outboard is pivoted into an inclined position to provide sufficient road
clearance and while in transit, road vibration and bumps are transferred from the trailer in motion over
a road surface. The resultant impacts cause bouncing of the heavy outboard which is pivoting on its
transom mount which if not correctly supported can result in damage to trim tilt mechanism, seals,
rams and the outboard.
The locating lug at the top of the rubber spring ensures the correct alignment to the outboard shaft and
prevents incorrect alignment or dislodging while trailering. The rubber spring supports the outboard at
the optimum inclination for trailering while absorbs shocks and vibration to the outboard while being
trailered on sealed or dirt roads. The shock absorber has the advantages of convenient installation, light
weight, water proof, favorable shock absorption effect, thereby being suitable to be used as the
outboard trim tilt trailering shock absorber.
These and other objects of the invention are provided in an outboard motor support for engaging,
supporting and cushioning the lower unit of an outboard motor against road shock during trailering,
which outboard motor support is characterized by a tubular rubber spring tilt rim support which is
fitted on to the ram piston of a tri ram tilt trim unit. The rubber spring provides a shock absorber
function between the Outboard and the tilt trim thereby providing absorption of transferred road
bumps, vibration, shock and cushioning the outboard and the lower unit of the outboard motor during
trailering. The specific length of the spring enables the outboard to be supported at the optimum height
from the road surface for trailering. This is particularly evident when trailering high horsepower
Outboards with 25" and 30" shaft lengths which require greater elevation from the road surface to be
safely transported.

     Boats and other such marine vehicles are known to include an outboard motor attached to the
transom of the boat via a hydraulic tilt and trim system. Typically, when the boat is either being placed
into the water, taken out of the water, in transit, or in storage, the motor is tilted upwards from the
ground forwardly. Conventionally, support devices referred to as "transom savers" are used to support
the outboard motor in this position.

An "Outboard Motor Support" is detailed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,685,888, dated Aug. 11, 1987, to Frank
 Brewer. The device includes a shock arm adapted to be mounted between a trailer and the shaft of an
outboard motor attached to a boat carried by the trailer. The shock arm includes a lower member
rigidly attached to the trailer frame and an upper member having a V-shaped portion and adapted to
receive the motor shaft. U.S. Pat. No. 3,693,536, dated Sept. 26, 1972, to James A. Driscoll, details an
"Outboard Motor Stabilizer". The stabilizer includes a forked end for embracing the front side of the
lower end of the upstanding propeller shaft housing of an outboard motor and a strap for releasably
securing the propeller shaft housing in the first forked end of the propeller. The second end of the
propeller has a mounting bracket for swinging the propeller relative to the mounting bracket about an
axis extending transversely of the second end of the propeller. The mounting bracket is in turn
supported from a mounting plate for swinging about an axis relative to the mounting plate disposed at
right angles to the first mentioned axis and the mounting plate is provided with means for securing the
device to the transverse cross member of a trailer frame. U.S. Pat. No. 3,941,344, dated Mar. 2, 1976,
to Albert E. Paterson, details another motor support. The motor support includes a substantially U
shaped yoke, a pedestal fastened to the base portion of the yoke, a retaining strap which engages rings
located in the yoke and a swivel coupling which is mounted on the end opposite the yoke and which is
engageable with a swivel mounted on the rearward terminal of a typical trailer frame. U.S. Pat. No.
4,842,239, dated June 27, 1989, to Darrell Kinsey, details an "Outboard Boat Motor Support" which
includes an elongated support shaft that is adjustable in length, a U-shaped foot connected to one end
of the support shaft and a transverse engagement rod and bracket connected to the opposite end of
the support shaft. The support device is designed for disposition between the outboard motor and the
boat trailer, with the U-shaped foot in engagement with the trailer and the transverse rod and bracket
in engagement with the mounting bracket through which the outboard motor is pivotally
interconnected to the transom of the boat. US Pat. No 5,775,669 dated July 7, 1998, to William Huggins
details an outboard Motor/Outdrive traveling bracket which is comprised of a rigid metal bracket
support linking the stern of the boat hull to the outboard motor out drive. US Pat. No 5,647,781 July
 15, 1997 to Johnson details a outboard motor support for preventing damage from inadvertent pivoting
of the motor during trailering. Which is comprised of a rigid longitudinal metal tube support between

the boat and outboard with a pair of spring loaded locking pins to set outboard inclination while
trailering.
However, modern outboard motors are typically loaded onto the main hydraulic "trim and tilt " piston,
and the transoms in modern boats are built to handle the weight and the torque from powerful 300+
horsepower engines and rough water. Thus, prior support devices that required drilling and/or
attachment hardware for attaching the transom saver support device to the trailer are unnecessary and
inconvenient. However, it remains desirable to stabilize the outboard motor in order to prevent the
outboard motor from excessively vibrating and bouncing during transit.
Examples of conventional transom savers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,431 to Estes, U.S. Pat. No.
4,828,186 to Weiss, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,239 to Kinsey et al which required drilling and or
attachment of hardware for attaching the transom saver device to the trailer which do not provide a
dampening shock absorption function and are a rigid fixture. Prior art detailed in Patent US08096521
which details a outboard motor stabilization which has metallic support shafts which provides a rigid
bridge between the tilt trim and outboard with not shock absorption function provided by the system
and method for outboard motor stabilizing ( US08096521).
 However, modern outboard motors are typically loaded onto the main tri-ram hydraulic "trim and tilt"
piston, and the transoms in modern boats are constructed to accommodate the weight and the torque
from high power v6 and v8 outboard engines.
Prior support devices require metal fixation which range from fixation between outboard shaft and trim
mechanism or between the outboard gearbox and the boat trailer. A telescoping support having one
end mounted in telescoping fashion in the outside support, with a spring provided between the
telescoping support including a frame-engaging yoke located at the opposite extending end of the
telescoping support. The outboard motor support is positioned in functional configuration with the
yoke engaging a transverse metal trailer frame member with a V-shaped foot-engaging pad. The
engaging V- shaped foot portion supports the outboard gear case during trailering. The prior art is a
telescopic tube with a mount at one end for connection to the trailer and a V shipped foot engaging
member which is affixed to the outboard gearbox. This outboard fixation method transfers vibration
and jolting forces from the trailer frame through to the outboard gearbox via the metal support.
The harsh forces and vibration transmitted through the boat trailer to the outboard has been overcome
with the use of a shock absorption rubber spring positioned over the ram piston and the outboard
thereby dampening the vibrations and bouncing induced from trailering a boat with an outboard out of
the water.
Thus, prior support devices that required drilling and/or support frame attachment hardware for
attaching the transom saver/outboard support device to the trailer are unnecessary and inconvenient.

 However, it remains desirable to position the outboard at an inclination to enable safe transportation
,provide dampening of vibration and outboard bouncing forces induced to an outboard motor while in
transit.
One of the problems which is realized in the trailering of outboard motors and boats and heavy
outboard motors in particular, is the risk of damaging the motor and trim tilt mechanism due to road
shock. Outboard motors are mounted on the transom at the rear of a boat and considerable pressure
and torque is exerted on the transom during trailering due to the weight of the motor. This torque
frequently causes damage to the transom and can weaken the transom, such that operation of the boat
in a normal manner is rendered dangerous.
Hence, there is a need for a convenient stabilizing device that is designed for use with a wide range of
modern tri ram tilt trim systems and high power outboard motors of marine vehicles.

Summary of the Invention
The invention is a rubber cylinder with a central hollow channel which fits over the trim piston and
supports the outboard. The invention provides a removable support for larger outboards and lower unit
during trailering. The invention utilizes a rubber cylinder with an internal rubber vulcanized spring to
provide a new and improved outboard motor trailering shock absorber support. The cylindrical rubber
spring is manually positioned onto a tri-ram trim tilt ram piston of the outboard. To manually fit the
removable rubber spring the outboard gearbox is inclined to its maximum range from the ground. The
rubber spring is slid over the trim tilt piston and sits at the base of the trim cylinder. The outboard
inclination is then reduced to allow the outboard shaft to rest on the rubber spring. The invention has a
locating lug at the top of the rubber spring which fits into a recess on the outboard shaft which
prevents deflection of the spring thereby ensuring correct alignment to the outboard shaft. The rubber
cylinder has a rubber volcanised spring composition and the larger outboard weight can be further
supported through increased hardness of the rubber or EPDM to provide additional compressive and
distortion resistance the spring steel wire thickness and hardness and spring coil composition.

Claims
The claims defining the invention are as follows:
    1. A support for an outboard when pivoted into an inclined position. The outboard motor and tri
        ram trim tilt shock absorbing support device provides support of an inclined outboard engine
        during trailering.
        An objective of this invention is to provide the optimum inclination of an outboard motor to
        provide ground clearance of the gearbox to road. The specific length of the cited rubber spring
        has been incorporated into the design to ensure the correct clearance of the gearbox to the
        road surface. The inventions length can be produced in a length of 20cm long for small
        outboards up to 30cm for large high-power outboards with extended shaft lengths.
             a. In the act of trailering the outboard is pivoted into an inclined position to provide
                  sufficient road clearance and while in transit road vibration and bumps are transferred
                  from the trailer in motion over a road surface. The resultant impacts cause bouncing of
                  the heavy outboard which is pivoting on its transom mount. If the outboard is not
                  correctly supported can result in damage to tilt rim mechanism, seals, rams and the
                  outboard. The invention provides correct inclined positioning of the outboard while
                  trailering and prevents outboard contact with road surface. Use of this invention as
                  detailed provides the optimum inclination and support of an outboard motor to provide
                  ground clearance of the gearbox to road while trailering. A damping device for an

                  mount which supports the outboard in an included tilt thereby reducing the
                  dependency of the trim tilt hydraulics to retain the inclination of the outboard. There is
                  an incidence of hydraulic tilt trim mechanisms losing hydraulic pressure at which the
                  outboard will return to a vertical orientation and often results in the outboard gear box
                  skeg impact on the ground surface.
        The invention provides improved outboard motor vibration dampening, shock absorption and
        trim tilt support. This is characterized by a cylindrical rubber spring which slides onto the trim tilt
        ram piston, bridging the trim tilt piston cylinder and the outboard shaft which is loaded onto the
        spring when the outboard is being trailered.
    2. The cited invention has a unique Locating lug at the top of the rubber spring which ensures
        correct alignment with outboard shaft.
        The location lug ensures correct alinement to the outboard shaft and prevents incorrect
        positioning and dislodgement of the spring during trailering.
    3. A damping wedge device for an outboard motor formed in accordance with Claim 1 or 2,
        characterized in that the damping element is made from a removable cylindrical volcanized
        rubber spring providing shock and vibration dampening for a high power outboard while
        trailering. The cited invention provides an outboard in an inclined position with support from
        vibration and bouncing of the outboard and lower unit during trailering,

   The invention provides improved outboard motor vibration dampening, shock absorption and
   trim tilt support which is characterized by a cylindrical rubber spring which is slide onto the trim

   being trailered.
4. The cited invention has a unique Locating lug at the top of the rubber spring to ensure correct
   alignment with outboard shaft.
   The location lug at the top of the rubber spring also prevents incorrect positioning and
   dislodgement of the spring during trailering.
5. A damping device for an outboard motor formed in accordance with any of the Claims 1-4 The
   rubber cylinder of the spring is coated in a high visibility florescent paint to assist visibility of the
   inclined outboard engine at the rear of the boat while being towed on a trailer.
