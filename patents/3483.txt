N6-(4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-yl)quinazoline-4,6-diamine has been tested in human
clinical trials for hyperproliferative diseases, particularly cancer, and more particularly
metastatic breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and salivary gland cancer (see Koch, Kevin.

[00051           Amplification or over-expression of ErbB2 has been shown to play a role in
the pathogenesis and progression of certain cancers, such as breast, ovarian, gastric, uterine,
colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer.
[0006]           In breast cancer patients, brain metastases are a leading cause of death in
ErbB2+ breast cancer patients and a serious unmet medical need. Patients with ErbB2+ breast
cancer have a significantly increased incidence of brain metastases following trastuzumab
therapy. There is an increasing incidence of brain metastases as women are living longer due
to better treatments for systemic disease.
[00071           Accordingly, there remains a need for the treatment of brain cancer.

edition).
[0032]           The phrases "therapeutically effective amount" or "effective amount" mean an
amount of a compound described herein that, when administered to a mammal in need of
such treatment, sufficient to (i) treat or prevent the particular disease, condition, or disorder,
(ii) attenuate, ameliorate, or eliminate one or more symptoms of the particular disease,
condition, or disorder, or (iii) prevent or delay the onset of one or more symptoms of the
particular disease, condition, or disorder described herein. The amount of a compound that
will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular
compound, disease condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the mammal in
need of treatment, but can nevertheless be routinely determined by one skilled in the art.
[00331           The terms "treat" or "treatment" refer to therapeutic, prophylactic, palliative or
preventative measures. Beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to,
alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening)
state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the
disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable.
"Treatment" can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not
receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or
disorder, as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the
condition or disorder is to be prevented.

[00521          Solid dispersions are generally prepared by dissolving the drug substance and
the dispersion polymer in a suitable solvent to form a feed solution, and then the feed solution
may be spray dried to form the solid dispersion (and remove the solvent). Spray drying is a
known process. Spray drying is generally performed by dissolving the drug substance
component and the dispersion polymer in a suitable solvent to prepare a feed solution. The
feed solution may be pumped through an atomizer into a drying chamber. The feed solution
can be atomized by conventional means known in the art, such as a two-fluid sonicating
nozzle, a pressure nozzle, a rotating nozzle and a two-fluid non-sonicating nozzle. Then, the
solvent is removed in the drying chamber to form the solid dispersion. A typical drying
chamber uses hot gases, such as forced air, nitrogen, nitrogen-enriched air, or argon to dry
particles. The size of the drying chamber may be adjusted to achieve particle properties or
throughput.
[0053]          Although the solid dispersion are preferably prepared by conventional spray
drying techniques, other techniques known in the art may be used, such as melt extrusion,
freeze drying, rotary evaporation, drum drying or other solvent removal processes.

[0064]           Suitable solvents are a solvent or mixture of solvents in which both drug
substance component and the dispersion polymer have adequate solubility (solubility greater
than 1 mg/mL). A mixture of solvents may be used if each component of the solid dispersion
(i.e., drug substance component and dispersion polymer) requires different solvents to obtain
the desired solubility. The solvent may be volatile with a boiling point of 150'C or less. In
addition, the solvent should have relatively low toxicity and be removed from the dispersion
to a level that is acceptable to The International Committee on Harmonization ("ICH")
guidelines. Removal of solvent to this level may require a subsequent processing step, such as
tray drying. Examples of suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, alcohols, such as

         Growth of NCI-N87 Gastric Carcinoma in Nude Mice Implanted Intracranially
[00116]          Tumor cells (NCI-N87 gastric carcinoma cells, NCI, Bethesda, MD) were
implanted in nude BALB/c female mice (Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.) via
intracranial injection directly into the brain. The mice were separated into four groups (N = 5)
and were injected with vehicle (saline), 1 X 105 tumor cells, 2.5 X 105 tumor cells, or 5 X 105
tumor cells. The results are shown in Figure 1. Brain tumor cell burden was associated with
decreased survival in the NCI-N87 model.

[001171           In a pilot study using    C albumin as the tracer and mannitol as the positive
control for blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption, it was confirmed that the intracranial
inoculation procedure did not mechanically disrupt the blood brain barrier.

                                             Intracranially
[00118]          Anesthetized nude BALB/c female mice (Taconic Laboritories Inc.,
Germantown, NY) were inoculated with human tumor cells (NCI-N87 gastric carcinoma
cells, NCI, Bethesda, MD) intracranially at lamba suture. 5 X 105 cells in saline were
implanted via intracranial injection. The mice were separated into three groups (N = 12);
vehicle (acidified 30 % Captisol@, pH about 4.5), 50 mg/kg lapatanib PO BID (30 %
Captisol@), and 75 mg/kg N4-(4-([1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-7-yloxy)-3-methylphenyl)
N6-(4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-yl)quinazoline-4,6-diamine PO BID (acidified 30 %
Captisol@, pH about 4.5). Dosing began two days after implantation. The dose may have
been reduced as necessary if drug-related weight loss (approximately 5 %) was observed. The
mice were monitored twice daily for general health and behavioral/neurological effects, and
body weights (BW) were determined twice weekly. At first sign of neurological problem or

solution, then add 5 N HCl in 200 gL increments until it forms a clear, yellow solution). The
mice were separated into groups and their PK was studied at 4 time points (0.5, 1, 2 and 4
hours, 4 mice per group per timepoint). The animals were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation at the
time points. Whole blood was drawn (300 gL) by cardiac puncture and plced in an eppendorf
tube containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ("EDTA") (37.5 gL, 1.5%). The samples
were centrifuged, and the plasma was decanted and frozen at -20 'C until delivered to
analytical chemistry. The brains were collected. The animals were perfused with 5-10 mL of
saline, and the brains were removed, weighed and placed into a fast prep tube for DMPK
analysis.

[00156]          The solid dispersion of Example 6 was tested against a crystalline, micronized
suspension formulation (d(v, 0.9)    = 3.0gm) of Example 21 under normal fasted conditions, as
well as with pretreatment using pentagastrin or famotidine. The solid dispersion of Example 6
was prepared as a suspension in water and administered orally. The micronized suspension of
Example 21 was prepared as a suspension with SyrSpend@ SF Dry reconstituted with water
and administered orally. To reduce variability, beagles were crossed over from pentagastrin
to famotidine after a 5 day washout period. Pentagastrin is a pH modifier to modify gastric
pH to about 2 to 3, and famotidine is a pH modifier to modify gastric pH to about 5 to 7.5

Basic Drugs: Development of a Canine Model." Pharm. Res. Vol. 22, No. 2 (Feb. 2005): pp.
188-192). There were four beagles per group. Group A received pentagastrin pretreatment,
the micronized suspension of Example 21, followed by a 5 day washout period, then
famotidine pretreatment, and finally the micronized suspension of Example 21. Group B
received pentagastrin pretreatment, the solid dispersion of Example 6, followed by a 5 day
washout period, then famotidine pretreatment, and finally the solid dispersion of Example 6.
