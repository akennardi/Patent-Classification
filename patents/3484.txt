Title of Invention:  METHOD AND KIT FOR DNA TYPING OF HLA
GENE
Technical Field
[0001]
     The present invention relates to a method and a kit
for DNA typing of a HLA gene using a massive parallel
sequencer.
Background Art
[0002]
     The human leucocyte antigen     (HLA), which represents
major human histocompatibility complex      (MHC), presents
peptides derived from foreign proteins such as pathogens
and peptides derived from self-proteins to T cells.       In
this manner, HLA is deeply involved in induction of
immunological  responses.    As major HLAs,  six types of
antigens are known, namely, class I molecules      (HLA-A,
HLA-B, HLA-C),  which is expressed in almost all cells,
and class  II molecules   (HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, HLA-DP),   which is
expressed mainly in immune cells.

                           -1A
[0003]
     The HLA class I antigen consists of a highly
polymorphic a  chain and a substantially non-polymorphic
P2-microglobulin; whereas the HLA class  II antigen

                            - 2
consists of a highly polymorphic    P chain  and a less
polymorphic a chain.   The a chains of class I molecules
are encoded by HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C genes.      The  P
chains of class II antigens are encoded by HLA-DRB1, HLA
DQB1 and HLA-DPBl genes, whereas the a chains are encoded
by HLA-DRA1,  HLA-DQAl and HLA-DPAl   genes.   In a gene
level, in HLA class I antigens, exon 2 and exon 3 of a
gene encoding an a chain are highly polymorphic; whereas,
in HLA class II antigens, exon 2 of a gene encoding a
chain is highly polymorphic.
[0004]
      A gene region encoding a HLA is located on short arm
of human chromosome 6 at 6p21.3.     A Class I region    (HLA-A,
HLA-C and HLA-B, etc.),   a class III region and a class II
region (HLA-DRA, HLA-DRBl,   HLA-DQAl, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPAl,
HLA-DPB1, etc.)  are arranged in this order from the
telomere side toward the centromere side.      Many genes are
encoded at an extremely high density and association of
these genes with transfusion, transplantation and various
diseases have been reported.     In the class III region, no
HLA genes are present and genes of complement components
and tumor necrosis factors    (TNF), etc. are present.
 [0005]
      In a HLA-DRB gene region encoding a    P chain  of a
HLA-DR antigen, it has been confirmed that 5 types of
structural polymorphisms are present.     In DR1 type and
DR10 type, pseudogenes such as HLA-DRB6 and HLA-DRB9 in

                             - 3
addition to HLA-DRB1 are located on the same chromosome.
In DR2 type, a HLA-DRB5    (DR51) gene and pseudogenes such
as HLA-DRB6 and HLA-DRB9 in addition to HLA-DRB1 are
located on the same chromosome.     In DR3, DR5 and DR6
types, a HLA-DRB3   (DR52) gene and pseudogenes such as
HLA-DRB2 and HLA-DRB9 in addition to HLA-DRB1 are located
on the same chromosome.    In DR4,  DR7 and DR9 types, a
HLA-DRB4  (DR53) gene and pseudogenes such as HLA-DRB7,
HLA-DRB8 and HLA-DRB9 in addition to HLA-DRB1 are located
on the same chromosome.    In contrast to these, in DR8
type, no HLA-DRB genes except HLA-DRB1 are located on the
same chromosome.
[0006]
     In the exon of each allele, a plurality of regions
exhibiting polymorphism are present.     In many cases,  a
nucleotide sequence   (amino acid sequence) present in a
certain polymorphic region is commonly present in a
plurality of alleles.    In short, each HLA allele is
specified by a plurality of polymorphic regions in
combination.   In a HLA class I antigen, not only a
polymorphic region in the exon but also exon 2 or exon 3
having the same nucleotide sequence is sometimes commonly
present in a plurality of alleles.
[0007]
     Since a highly polymorphic region is present in a
HLA, the number of types of alleles is known to be
extremely large and notation of them has been defined:

i.e.,   a first field (two-digit level) is for
discrimination of serologic HLA types, a second field (4
digit level) is for discrimination of alleles having an
amino acid substitution in the same serologic HLA type, a
third field (6-digit level) is for discrimination of
alleles having a base substitution not accompanying an
amino acid mutation and a fourth field (8-digit level) is
for discrimination of alleles having a base substitution
in an intron, which is out of the genetic region encoding
a HLA molecule.
[0008]
      In bone marrow transplantation, it is said that if
the HLA type of a patient seeking to receive a transplant
completely matches the HLA type of a donor at a 4-digit
level, the success rate of transplantation improves and a
severe GVHD frequency reduces.    Conversely,  if the HLA
types do not match at a 4 digit level, a risk of causing
a failure such as a rejection response increases.
Accordingly, accurate and highly precise HLA typing is
extremely important also in a clinical point of view.
[0009]
      As a method for DNA typing in a HLA gene, a SBT
 (sequence based typing) method and a SSO (Sequence
Specific Oligonucleotide) -Luminex method based on a
polymerase chain reaction   (PCR) are in mainstream.
      These conventional DNA typing methods have an
advantage in that typing of many samples is quickly

                            - 5
performed; however, sometimes fail to accurately
determine a polymorphic region and cis/trans positional
relationship of exons on a chromosome in the case of a
class I gene.   Because of this, phase ambiguity occurs,
highly precise HLA typing was sometimes not easily
performed.
      Since the conventional methods are DNA typing
methods using PCR mainly based on exon regions of each
gene, base substitutions in an intron region and a
promoter region are overlooked, with the result that
there was a risk of failure in detection of a null allele,
which has the same gene structure as other HLA expressing
genes but is suppressed in expression.

Summary of Invention
Technical Problem
 [0012]

                            - 6
      An object of the present invention is to provide a
method and a kit for highly precise DNA typing in which
ambiguity derived from phase ambiguity is eliminated.
Solution to Problem
 [0013]
      The present inventors newly conceived an idea of
newly designing a PCR primer capable of specifically
amplifying genes of HLAs such as HLA class I molecules
including HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C and HLA class II
molecules including HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA
DPAl and HLA-DPBl, setting suitable PCR conditions and
applying a massive parallel sequencing technique.   Based
on the new idea, they repeatedly studied with a view to
attaining the above object.    As a result, they
accomplished the present invention.
 [0014]
      More specifically, the present invention provides a
method for DNA typing of HLA, including the following
steps:
      ()  a step of preparing a set of primers which
respectively anneal specifically to an upstream region
and a downstream region of each of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C,
HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 genes in human
genome sequence, and a set of primers which respectively
anneal specifically to exon 2 and a 3' untranslated
region of HLA-DRBl;

      (2) a step of amplifying a test sample  (DNA) by a
PCR using the sets of primers;
      (3) a step of determining the nucleotide sequences
of PCR amplified products;   and
      (4) a step of carrying out a homology search within
a database.
Advantageous effects of Invention
 [0015]
      The method of the present invention, since it
provides all nucleotide sequences required for DNA typing
of a HLA gene from a single molecule, is an ultimate DNA
typing method in which phase ambiguity due to unclear
cis/trans positional relationship is eliminated.    Owing
to this, highly precise matching of HLAs between a
patient seeking to receive a transplant and a donor
candidate upon transplantation is realized.
      Since all nucleotide sequences of a HLA gene
including the peripheral regions such as a promoter
region, exon regions and intron regions are determined, a
null allele, which is not expressed at all or suppressed
in expression, and a novel allele can be detected.

Modes for Carrying Out the Invention
[0017]
      Now, the DNA typing method of the present invention
will be more specifically described step by step.
      (1) Step of preparing a primer set
      In the DNA typing method of the present invention,
first, a set of primers which respectively anneal
specifically to an upstream region and a downstream
region of each of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1,
HLA-DPAl and HLA-DPBl genes in the human genome sequence
and a set of primers which respectively anneal
specifically to exon 2 and a 3' untranslated region of
HLA-DRB1 are prepared.
      The genome sequence of human chromosome 6 (6p2l.3)
in which a HLA gene is present has been already
elucidated and association of the gene structure and the
structure of an expression product   (HLA molecule) has
been known (see Figure 1 and Figure 2).
 [0018]

                               - 10
      More specifically, genes of HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C,
which are called classic HLA class I molecules, each
contain 7 or 8 exons      (Figure 1(a)).     Outside of exon 1,
two types of enhancers and a promoter region are present
to control expression      (Figure 1   (b)).
      It is further known that many polymorphic regions
are present in    exon 2,   3 and 4.   Thus,   PCR was performed
by using primers prepared particularly based on exon 2
and 3 in conventional DNA typing methods.          Accordingly, a
problem of phase ambiguity has occurred as mentioned
above.
      In the meantime, the genes of HLA-DR, HLA-DQ and
HLA-DP, which are called classic HLA class II molecules,
consist of a chains and      P chains,    whose genes each
contain 5 to 6 exons      (Figure 2   (a)).   Outside of exon 1,
a promoter region is present to control expression
(Figure 2   (b)).
      It is further known that many polymorphic regions
are present in    exon 2 and 3.     Thus,   PCR was performed by
using primers prepared particularly based on exon 2 in
conventional DNA typing methods.         Accordingly, a problem
of phase ambiguity occurred as mentioned above.
 [0019]
      In the present invention, a set of primers which can
amplify   (by PCR) all regions of a gene        (including not
only exons but also introns, 5' and 3' untranslated
regions and a promoter region) in each of classic class I

                             - 11
molecules   (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and classic class II
molecules   (HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPAl and HLA-DPB1);
and a set of primers which can amplify (by PCR) the gene
regions of HLA-DRB1 including exon 2 to a 3'       untranslated
region are prepared, and PCR products obtained by PCR
amplification using the sets of primers are subjected to
next-generation   sequencing   (described later) .   Therefore,
uncertainty such as phase ambiguity can be eliminated and
the presence or absence of a null allele can be
accurately detected.
[0020]
      Specifically, PCR primer sets listed in Table 1 to
Table 4 below are prepared.
      In Table 1, SEQ ID Nos. 1 to 3 represent a set of
PCR primers specifically amplifying a HLA-A gene, which
is  an a chain of MHC class I.     These primers of the set
are nucleotide sequences located at positions, which
correspond to the upstream and downstream of all regions
of a HLA-A gene    (including promoter, exons and introns),
and sandwich the all regions, in the human genome
sequence   (Reference sequence: hg19).
 [0021]
      SEQ ID No. 1 has a nucleotide sequence corresponding

to a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the
29,914,925th position to the 29,914,952nd position in a
human genome sequence   (Reference sequence: hgl9).
      The length of a PCR product obtained by using these
primer sets is estimated as about 5,500 bases     (bp).
 [0022]
      In Table 1, SEQ ID Nos. 4 and 5 represent a set of
PCR primers specifically amplifying a HLA-B gene, which

and sandwich the all regions, in the human genome
sequence   (Reference sequence: hgl9).
 [0023]
      SEQ ID No. 4 has a complementary nucleotide sequence
to a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the
31,325,796th position to the 31,325,820th position in a
human genome sequence    (Reference sequence:  hgl9).
      SEQ ID No. 5 has a nucleotide sequence corresponding
to the 31,321,212nd position to the 31,321,235th position
in a human genome sequence    (Reference sequence: hgl9).

                            - 13
      The length of a PCR product obtained by using these
primer sets is estimated as about 4,600 bases     (bp).
 [0024]
      In Table 1, SEQ ID Nos. 6 to 8 represent a set of
PCR primers specifically amplifying a HLA-C gene, which
is  an a chain of MHC class I.   These primers of the set
are nucleotide sequences located at positions, which
correspond to the upstream and downstream of all regions
of a HLA-C gene   (including promoter, exons and introns),
and sandwich the all regions, in the human genome
sequence   (Reference sequence: hgl9).
 [00253
      SEQ ID No. 6 has a complementary nucleotide sequence
to a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the
31,240,868th position to the 31,240,892nd position in a
human genome sequence   (Reference sequence: hg19).
      SEQ ID No. 7 has a complementary nucleotide sequence
to a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the
31,240,868th position to the 31,240,892nd position in a
human genome sequence   (Reference sequence: hgl9).
      SEQ ID No. 8 has a nucleotide sequence corresponding
to the 31,236,991st position to the 31,236,114th position
in a human genome sequence    (Reference sequence: hgl9).
      The length of a PCR product obtained by using these
primer sets is estimated as about 4,800 bases     (bp).

gene of a HLA-DRB1 gene, which is a                              P   chain of MHC class

human genome sequence                  (Reference sequence: hgl9).
        SEQ ID No. 10 has a complementary nucleotide

      The length of a PCR product obtained by using these
primer sets is estimated as about 5,200 bases     (bp).
[0029]
      In Table 2, SEQ ID Nos. 31 and 32 represent a set of

gene, which is a   P chain of MHC class II.   These primers
of the set are nucleotide sequences located at positions,
which correspond to the upstream and downstream of a 5'
untranslated region to exon 2 of a HLA-DRB1 gene and
sandwich the 5' untranslated region to exon 2 in the

        These primers can be prepared by a method routinely
used in this field.                          Furthermore, the sets of primers
described in Table 1 and Table 2 are the most preferable
examples.               In     the method of the present                     invention,            any
set of primers can be used as long as the set of primers
is a set of a forward primer and a reverse primer capable

                              - 37
of annealing to the positions, which correspond to the
upstream and downstream of all regions of each HLA gene
and sandwich the all regions.
 [0079]
 (2) Step of PCR amplification
      In the method of the present invention, a test
sample   (DNA) is amplified by PCR using the sets of
primers prepared in the above step (1).
      The PCR amplification reaction is performed in
accordance with a general protocol and more specifically,
as follows.
      1. DNA is extracted from a test sample depending
upon the form of the sample.
      2. The DNA extracted is quantified and the
concentrations of primers are appropriately set to
prepare the reaction solution.
      3. Reaction conditions are set and a PCR is
performed.
      For example:
      Thermal denaturation step     (usually 92 to 970 C)
      Annealing step   (usually 55 to 72*C)
      Extension step   (usually 65 to 800 C)
      In the method of the present invention, in the case
of a HLA gene    (except HLA-DRB1),    the temperature of the
annealing step is    preferably set at about 600C.     Owing to
the annealing at about 60*C,     alleles can be produced at
the equivalent ratio     (uniformly) .   In the case of a HLA-

                           - 38
DRB1, the temperature of the annealing step is preferably
set at about 70 0 C. Owing to the annealing at about 70*C,
a desired DR subtype alone can be specifically produced.
     4. The obtained PCR product is purified and
subjected to the following nucleotide sequencing step.
[0080)
(3) Step of nucleotide sequencing
     Next, the nucleotide sequence of the PCR product
(amplified DNA) produced in the above step    (2) is
determined.  The step is preferably performed by a
technique called next-generation sequencing    (or ultrahigh
sequencing).  With respect to the next-generation
sequencing, see, for example, "Experimental Medicine",
Vol. 27, No. 1, 2009   (Yodo-sha).
[0081]
     The sequence herein is determined by a method based
on pyro-sequencing, which is employed in a genome
sequencer FLX system of Roche.    The sequencing method
will be described below.
     1. The PCR product obtained in the above step (2) is
broken up by a nebulizer into fragments of about 500
bases.
     2. To an end of each of the DNA fragments, a DNA
adaptor is attached.
     3. DNA fragments attached with a DNA adaptor are
dissociated into single stranded DNA fragments, which are
allowed to bind to beads via the adaptor.    The obtained

                           - 39
beads are encompassed and taken in a water-in-oil
emulsion  (a micro-reactor environment containing a single
DNA fragment bound to a single bead is formed).
[0082]
     4. Emulsion PCR is performed to form copies of each
DNA fragment on a bead (Each DNA fragment is clonally
amplified in  each micro reactor.   In this manner, many
fragments can be simultaneously and in parallel amplified
without competition with other sequences) .   Subsequently,
the emulsion is destroyed and beads having amplified DNA
fragments are collected.
     5. The beads are concentrated and loaded in a pico
titer plate  (a single well has a size enough to place a
single bead).
     6. Pyrophosphoric acid produced by a polymerase
during an enzymatic reaction is detected with respect to
each bead by a fluorescent reaction of luciferase.    Based
on the intensity and the pattern of fluorescence thus
emitted, the nucleotide sequence of DNA is determined.
Four types of nucleic acids   (A, C, G, T) are added in a
predetermined order.   The chemiluminescence pattern in
accordance with the nucleic acid added is recorded.
Based on the intensity of signal and positional data in
combination, the nucleotide sequence is determined.
[0083]
(4) Step of DNA typing

                            - 40
     Subsequently, the nucleotide sequence obtained in
step  (3) is compared with data of known HLA alleles
within the nucleotide sequencing database.     In this
manner, the allele type (up to 8 digits) contained in the
test sample is determined.
[0084]
     In the method of the present invention, typical sets
of primers are listed  in  Table 1  (described above) . The
method of the present invention is characterized in that
primers are designed so as to correspond to all regions
of each of the genes of HLA class I and HLA class II
except HLA-DRB1 and the positions sandwiching exon 2 to
3' untranslated region of HLA-DRB1 and the sequence of
the DNA amplified so as to correspond to almost all
regions is determined.    In this manner, phase ambiguity
(uncertainty) is eliminated and information on a null
allele can be obtained.
Examples
[0085]
     The present invention will be more specifically
described by way of Examples below; however, the present
invention is not limited to these Examples.

(Example 1)
[Experimental method]

                            - 41
     1. Using genomic DNA already extracted as a template
and primer sets specific to individual HLA class I genes
(see Table 1: SEQ ID Nos. 1 to 8),     a PCR was carried out.
The procedure is more specifically as follows.
      (1) PCR amplification was performed by use of Prime
STAR GXL polymerase   (TaKaRa) . More specifically,    to 50
ng of a genomic DNA solution, 4 4L of 5 x PrimeSTAR GXL
buffer, 1.6 pL of a dNTP solution, PCR primers      (4 pL  (1
pmol/pL) for each) and 0.8 pL of Prime STAR GXL
polymerase were added.    The whole amount of the reaction
solution was adjusted to be 20 4L with sterilized water.
      (2) After kept at 94CC for 2 minutes, the reaction
solution was subjected to a step consisting of a reaction
at 98*C for 10 seconds,   a reaction at 60*C for 20 seconds
and a reaction at 68*C for 5 minutes.     This step was
repeated 30 times.   Note that,   for the PCR amplification,
Gene Amp PCR System 9700    (Applied Biosystems) was used.
After the PCR, the amplification states of PCR products
were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis.      The
electrophoretic patterns were shown in Figure 4.
[0087]
     2. The nucleotide sequences of the PCR products were
determined specifically as follows.
      (1) A PCR product was purified by QIAquick PCR
Purification Kit   (QIAGEN) in accordance with the standard
protocol.

                             - 42
      (2) The concentration of the purified PCR product
was measured by PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Kit
(Invitrogen) in accordance with the standard protocol.
      (3) A solution of the purified PCR product, a
concentration of which was adjusted to be 500 ng/100 pL,
was subjected to construction of a rapid library, and
then, emulsion PCR and sequencing by Genome Sequencer
(GS) Junior   (Roche) were carried out in accordance with
the standard protocol to obtain nucleotide sequences of
10,000 reads per sample.
      (4) These sequences were connected and edited by GS
de novo Assembler   (Roche) .  Thereafter,    a search for
homology with known nucleotide sequences on a DNA
database was performed to identify alleles on the HLA
gene.
[0088]
[Discussion]
      In HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C, PCR primers, which
specifically amplify 5.5 kb, 4.6 kb and 4.8 kb,
respectively, were designed.      PCR conditions were studied
and agarose gel electrophoresis of the resultant PCR
products was performed.    As a result,    it  was found that
HLA class I genes all provide a single PCR amplified
product at a position corresponding to a desired
molecular weight   (Figure 4) .   Furthermore,   the nucleotide
sequences of the PCR products were determined by the
Sanger method.   As a result, HLA alleles were obtained in

                             -  43
consistent with known documents.       From this, it was
confirmed that the PCR system of the invention can be
used for HLA typing.
 [0089]
      Using three specimens of a HLA-B*40:02 homozygote
and 17  specimens of a HLA-B*40:02 heterozygote including
combinations of alleles    (B*40 and B*55),    in which phase
ambiguity was observed in a conventional DNA typing
method, a PCR was performed.       As the result of HLA typing
of the PCR products derived from the HLA-B gene by GS
Junior, HLA-B*40: 02:   01:   01 was detected from all
specimens.   In the 17 heterozygote specimens, 2 types of
novel alleles were detected in addition to 15 alleles
already known.   In particular, with respect to a single
specimen having a combination of alleles       (B*40 and B*55)
in which phase ambiguity was observed, HLA-B*40: 02:       01:
01 and HLA-B*55:   02: 01:  01 were identified by typing.
From this, it was demonstrated that the method of the
invention enables HLA typing at a 8-digit level without
phase ambiguity; and that the method of the invention is
an excellent tool for efficiently detecting a
substitution, an insertion and a deletion of bases in a
promoter and introns, which are causes of a null allele.

(Example 2)
[Experimental method]

                             - 44
      1. Using a genomic DNA already extracted as a
template and primer sets specific to individual HLA class
I and HLA class II genes     (see Tables 1 to 4: SEQ ID Nos.
1 to 8, 9 to 22, 31 to 50),     a PCR was carried out.   The
procedure is more specifically as follows.
       (1) PCR amplification was performed by use of Prime
STAR GXL polymerase (TaKaRa).      More specifically, to 50
ng of a genomic DNA solution, 4      iL of 5 x PrimeSTAR GXL
buffer, 1.6 pAL of a dNTP solution, PCR primers (1 to 7 gL
 (4 pmol/ptL))  and 0.8 pL of Prime STAR GXL polymerase were
added.    The whole amount of the reaction solution was
adjusted to be 20 pL with sterilized water.
       (2) After kept at 940C for 2 minutes, the reaction
solution was subjected to a step consisting of a reaction
at 98*C for 10 seconds and a reaction at 70*C for 5
minutes.    This step was repeated 30 times.    Note that,
for the PCR amplification, Gene Amp PCR System 9700
 (Applied Biosystems) was used.     After the PCR, the
amplification states of PCR products were checked by
agarose gel electrophoresis.      The electrophoretic
patterns were shown in Figure 6.
 [0091]
      2. The nucleotide sequences of the PCR products were
determined specifically as follows.
       (1) A PCR product was purified by QIAquick PCR
Purification Kit    (QIAGEN) in accordance with the standard
protocol.

                           - 45
      (2) The concentration of the purified PCR product
was measured by PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Kit
(Invitrogen) in accordance with the standard protocol.
      (3) The purified PCR product, the concentration of
which was adjusted to be 100 ng, was subjected to
construction of a fragment library, and then emulsion PCR
and sequencing by Ion Personal Genome Machine   (Ion PGM)
(Life Technologies) were carried out in accordance with
the standard protocol to obtain nucleotide sequences of
300,000 reads per sample.
      (4) These sequences were connected and edited by GS
De Novo Assembler (Roche).   Thereafter, a search for
homology with known nucleotide sequences on a DNA
database was performed to identify alleles on the HLA
gene.
00921
[Results and discussion]
      1. PCR primers, which specifically amplify 4 kb to
12 kb in the region from a 5' untranslated region to exon
2 of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C and HLA-DRB1, the region from
exon 2 to a 3' untranslated region of HLA-DRB1, the
region from a 5' untranslated region to exon 2 of HLA
DQB1 and HLA-DPB1 and the region from exon 2 to a 3'
untranslated region of HLA-DPB1, were designed.    PCR
conditions were studied and agarose gel electrophoresis
of the resultant PCR products was performed.    As a result,
it was found that HLA class I and HLA class II genes all

                           - 46
provide a single amplified product at a position
corresponding to a desired molecular weight (Figure 6).
Furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of the PCR products
were determined by the Sanger method.   As a result, HLA
alleles were obtained in consistent with known documents.
It was confirmed herein again that the PCR system of the
invention can be used for HLA typing.
 [0093]
      2. Using four specimens containing a combination of
alleles, in which phase ambiguity is observed in a
conventional DNA typing method, a PCR was performed.    PCR
products derived from the regions from a 5' untranslated
region to exon 2 of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C and HLA-DRB1
genes, the region from exon 2 to a 3' untranslated region
of a HLA-DRB1 gene, the region from a 5' untranslated
region to exon 2 of HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DPB1 genes, and the
region from exon 2 to a 3' untranslated region of a HLA
DPB1 gene were subjected to HLA typing by Ion PGM.   As a
result, typing of whole gene regions of HLA-A, HLA-B,
HLA-C, HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 were successfully made.
With respect to HLA-DPB1, typing of an exon alone was
successfully made.   Furthermore, in each of the HLA-B,
HLA-C, HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 genes, a novel allele was
detected.   From this, it was demonstrated that the method
of the invention enables HLA typing at a 8-digit level
without phase ambiguity; and that the method of the
invention is an excellent tool for efficiently detecting

                           - 47
a substitution, an insertion and a deletion of bases in a
promoter and introns, which are causes of a null allele.
 [0094]
 (Example 3)
 [Experimental method]
      1. Genomic DNA was extracted by using Buccal Cell
DNA Extraction Kit, BuccalQuick (TRIMGEN).
      2. The genomic DNA extracted by use of Buccal Cell
DNA Extraction Kit, BuccalQuick   (TRIMGEN) was further
purified with isopropanol and ethanol.
      3. Using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit  (QIAGEN),
genomic DNA was extracted.
      4. Three each of genomic DNA specimens extracted in
items 1 to 3 above were subjected to PCR using primer
sets specific to HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C and HLA-DQB1
performed in the same experimental method as in Example 1
and Example 2 (see Table 1 and Table 4: SEQ ID Nos. 1 to
8, 29, 30, 48 to 50).   After the PCR, the amplification
states of the PCR products were checked by agarose gel
electrophoresis.   The electrophoretic patterns were shown
in Figure 7.
[0095]
[Experimental results and discussion]
      In Figure 7, lanes 1 to 3 show the amplification
states of PCR products in the case where extraction was
made by Experimental method 1, lanes 4 to 6 show the
amplification states of PCR products in the case where

                          - 48
extraction was made by Experimental method 2, and lanes 7
to 9 show the amplification state of PCR products in the
case where extraction was made by Experimental method 3.
PCR amplification in the case where genomic DNA extracted
by Experimental method 1 was used as a template in any
gene is equivalent to PCR amplification in the case where
genomic DNA extracted by Experimental method 3 was used,
and a desired PCR product was obtained.  In Experimental
method 3, blood must be taken; however in Experimental
method 1, cells can be taken from the oral mucous
membrane.  Therefore, it was demonstrated that if the
method of the present invention is employed, HLA typing
can be sufficiently performed even if blood cannot be
taken.
