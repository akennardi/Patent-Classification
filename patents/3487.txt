   Detailed Description
   Some embodiments of the present invention relate generally
 5 to an electronic gaming components such as electronic
   gaming machines  (EGMs) having an audio visual device with
   an audio visual output whose output is controlled at least
   partially based on an audio visual output of at least one
   peer electronic gaming machine.   In other embodiments
10 electronic gaming components such as electronic gaming
   machines comprise at least one interactive component and
   the interactive component is controlled by interactivity
   data received from at least one peer EGM.
15 Herein, an "electronic gaming component" is most typically
   an electronic gaming machine but can be another gaming
   component, for example, a jackpot system or a bonus system
   and in particular, the displays of such systems.
20 "Peer" electronic gaming components are, as will be
   apparent from the following description either those
   explicitly connected to form a peer group or those
   components which have the capacity to directly affect one
   another, for example in embodiments which employ sensors
25 to obtain peer information, peers may be those components
   within range of the sensors.   In some embodiments, an
   electronic gaming component may belong to more than one
   peer group.  In some embodiments, gaming components which
   are peers of one another may have different sets of peers.
30
   The core components of an electronic gaming machine having
   an audio visual device with an audio visual output whose
   output is controlled at least partially based on an audio
   visual output of at least one peer electronic gaming
35 machine are illustrated in Figure 1.   An electronic gaming
   machine 100 comprises at least one audio visual device 110
   that is under the control of an audio visual controller
                                            995788 11 (GHMatters) P71044.AU.5 16/05/18

                               - 5
   120.  The audio visual controller 120 controls the audio
   visual device 110 based on a signal obtained by an audio
   visual input 130 that is indicative of an audio visual
   output of at least one peer electronic gaming machine.
 5
   Depending on the specific embodiment, the audio visual
   device may output an audio signal, a visual signal or a
   combination of audio and visual.   It will be also
   appreciated that there may be a plurality of audio visual
10 devices 110.   It will also be appreciated that some or all
   of these audio visual devices may be under the sole
   control of the audio visual controller 110.           The most
   notable example of an audio visual device that may or may
   not be under the control of an audio visual controller 120
15 is the display 140.   As illustrated in Figure 1, the
   display 140 will at least be under the control of the game
   outcome generator 150 which controls the display of game
   outcomes that it generates in response to player input 160
   so that a player can see the result of a game on the
20 display 140.   In some embodiments, the audio visual
   controller 120 may modify the display 140, for example by
   altering the background colours of the display 140 based
   on the audio visual input 130.   Alternatively, a separate
   audio visual device 110 may be provided and only this
25 device may be controlled by the audio visual controller
   120.
   The audio visual controller 120 may base its control
   partly on an outcome generated by the game outcome
30 generator 150.   In this mode of operation the output of
   the audio visual device(s) is advantageously based not
   only on the outcomes of games played on electronic gaming
   machine 100 but those of peer electronic gaming machines
   which are reflected in their own audio visual outputs.
35
   Referring to Figure 2 there is shown an electronic gaming
   machine.  The gaming machine 10 includes a console 12
                                            995788 11 (GHMatters) P71044.AU.5 16/05/18

                              - 6
   having a display 14 on which is displayed representations
   of a game 16 that can be played by a player.           Display 14
   is surrounded by a bezel 43 having lighting embedded
   therein.  A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10 houses a
 5 bank of buttons for enabling a player to interact with the
   gaming machine, in particular during game play.                  The mid
   trim 20 also houses a credit input mechanism 24 which in
   this example includes a coin input chute 24A and a bill
   collector 24B.  Other credit input mechanisms may also be
10 employed, for example, a card reader for reading a smart
   card, debit card or credit card.   A reading device may
   also be provided for the purpose of reading a player
   tracking device, for example as part of a loyalty program.
   The player tracking device may be in the form of a card,
15 flash drive or any other portable storage medium capable
   of being read by the reading device, for example an RFID
   device.
   The top box 26 has a display for example a video display
20 unit, which may be of the same type as the display 14, or
   of a different type.  The displays 14 and 25 shown in
   Figure 2 are in the form of a video display unit,
   particularly a cathode ray tube screen device.
   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid crystal
25 display, plasma screen, any other suitable video display
   unit, or the visible portion of an electromechanical
   device.
   The gaming machine 10 has a light tower 40 capable of
30 emitting light in a number of different colours to
   indicate the operating state of the machine for example if
   the machine has a fault.
   Figure 3 illustrates the electronic gaming machine of
35 Figure 2 as a block diagram.   The electronic gaming
   machine 300 comprises bezel lighting 310 which is
   controlled by bezel controller 320.   Game outcomes are
                                            995788 11 (GHMatters) P71044.AU.5 16/05/18

   displayed independently on display 340 under control of
   the game outcome generator 350.  The bezel controller 320
   receives input signals from the sensor 330 which measures
   light output from surrounding gaming machines.               The bezel
 5 controller 320 also receives an input from the game
   outcome generator 350.  The bezel controller 320 employs a
   control algorithm to determine bezel lighting parameters
   based on the signals received from the sensor 330 and the
   outcome generator 350 and controls the bezel lighting 310
10 accordingly.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that an
   advantage of employing a sensor is that the sensor 330 can
   reflect the prevailing lighting conditions from
15 neighbouring gaming machines and other gaming components
   so that a lighting effect can be achieved where light
   spreads from gaming machine to gaming machine.              A sensor
   330 can also measure ambient light so it can be taken into
   account.  In a particularly embodiment, the light output
20 from the bezel has certain characteristics to enable the
   gaming machine to sense and distinguish the light from
   other lighting: for example it pulses at a particular
   frequency or it is emitted within a particular frequency
   band.  As shown in Figure 2 the sensor 330 can be mounted
25 on the top of a light tower 40.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in some
   environments it may not be practical to sense the light of
   another gaming machine and accordingly it may be
30 appropriate to link the plurality of electronic gaming
   machines in a peer-to-peer data network to enable them to
   communicate data reflecting their lighting status.                     A
   number of different types of data links may be used to
   link gaming machines, for example an infrared link, a blue
35 tooth link, a wireless link, or a fixed cable such as
   Ethernet.  An embodiment with a data link is illustrated
   schematically in Figure 4 in relation to two gaming
                                           995788 11 (GHMatters) P71044.AU.5 16/05/18

                              - 8
   machines although a person skilled in the art will
   appreciate that this technique can readily be extended to
   any number of gaming machines.  Communication via the data
   link may occur using any suitable communication scheme
 5 including infrared communication, radio frequency
   communication and other data communication techniques such
   as TCP/IP.
   The electronic gaming machines 400A and 400B of Figure 4
10 are constructed generally in the same manner as the
   electronic gaming machine of Figure 3 except for the
   sensor 330 is replaced by input/output devices 470 in each
   of the electronic gaming machines 400.  That is, each
   electronic gaming machine has a display 440, a game
15 outcome generator 450, bezel lighting 410 and a bezel
   controller 420.  In this exemplary embodiment the bezel
   controllers are configured to output their current
   lighting status via input/output devices 470 over data
   link 480.  Thus, the electronic gaming machines exchange
20 current lighting data.  Each bezel controller 420 then
   controls its own bezel lighting 410 based on data received
   from its own game outcome generator 450 and the other
   bezel controller 420.
25 A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the above
   technique can be used to generate organic lighting effects
   where lighting generated from a winning outcome on one
   gaming machine can spread to another gaming machine.                        A
   variety of control algorithms can be employed in order to
30 control the spread of the lighting effects.          For example,
   to control the effect of the lighting so that it has a
   reduced effect the further a gaming machine is from
   another gaming machine which has a winning outcome.                       In
   general, the goal of a control algorithm is to alter the
35 audio visual output of peer gaming machines to show that
   they have become "excited" based on outcomes on other
   gaming machines.
                                           995788 11 (GHMatters) P71044.AU.5 16/05/18

                               - 9
   Thus, there would typically be a period of excitement and
   then a gradual reduction in rates and changes.
 5 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that gaming
   machines may interact with other peer gaming components in
   a gaming room for example a display displaying a
   progressive jackpot amount or displaying awarding of a
   jackpot.
10
   As illustrated in Figure 5A, electronic gaming machines
   may be arranged into a series of groups, for example by
   gaming machines that are within the sensor range of one
   another or by arbitrary segmentation if a data link is
15 used.  Figure 5A illustrates an arrangement where there
   are five peer groups of gaming machines in a gaming room
   500.  A first peer group 510 having gaming machines 515A,
   515B and 515C, a second peer group 520 having gaming
   machines 525A, 525B and 525C, a third peer group 530
20 having gaming machines 535A, 535B, 535C and 535D, a fourth
   peer group 540 having gaming machines 545A, 545B, 545C and
   a fifth peer group 550 having gaming machines 555A, 555B
   and 555C.
25 These peer groups 510,520,530,540,550 may be connected in
   a number of different ways.   For example, just as the
   individual gaming machines within each peer group are
   connected as peers, the five groups may be created as a
   super peer group.  Alternatively, as illustrated in Figure
30 5B, the five groups, 510,520,530,540,550 may be under the
   control of central controller 560 that sends audio visual
   modification data by a data link 570 to each of the gaming
   machines.  That is the central controller 560 of Figure 5B
   collates audio visual output information from each of the
35 peer groups and determines whether gaming machines of any
   of the other peer groups should be modified on this basis.
                                            995788 11 (GHMatters) P71044.AU.5 16/05/18

                               - 10
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that various
   modifications may be made to the above embodiments. For
   example referring to Figure 4, rather than the obtaining
   data regarding the audio visual output of a peer EGM from
 5 a bezel controller, data could be output from one EGM to
   another that lets the receiving EGM infer the lighting
   status of a peer EGM such as game outcome data from
   another EGM.
10 Further, other elements of interactivity between EGMs
   become possible to alter the behaviour of EGMs,
   particularly once a peer-to-peer data link is established,
   and EGMs (or other electronic gaming components) may
   include a wide variety of interactive components designed
15 to be controlled in response to interactivity data output
   from peer EGMs  (or based on the sensed audio visual
   output) to vary the EGMs behaviour.   For example, play
   attributes of an EGM such as rate of spin, payout or
   bonusing could be affected if, for example, the game
20 outcome generator interacts with the game outcomes of
   other machines.   Similarly, the appearance of symbols,
   number of wild symbols, frequency of symbols might be
   varied.   Further "excited" EGMs might contribute more to a
   progressive jackpot or accrue more loyalty points for the
25 players playing them if they have a player tracking card
   inserted.
   In a further variation additional non-peer factors might
   influence the behaviour of an EGM in addition to peer
30 gaming machines influencing behaviour.   For example, data
   specifying that jackpot building centrally on a jackpot
   controller has exceeded a predetermined limit might be
   communicated to each of the EGM in order to change their
   behaviour.
35
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that various
   other modifications may be made without departing from the
                                            995788 11 (GHMatters) P71044.AU.5 16/05/18

                              - 11
   scope of the invention described herein.      For example,
   current bezels typically consist of multicoloured LED
   lighting spaced relatively wide distance apart.                  These
   bezels can be modified to incorporate more LEDs.                   Further,
 5 other techniques such as the use of optical fibres could
   be used to produce a lighting output.  As described above,
   it is not necessary that it be bezel lighting that should
   be modified for example, the background colour of a game
   could be varied based on the output of neighbouring gaming
10 machines or an audio output can be altered.
   The methods of the above embodiments are summarised in
   Figures 6A and 6B.  As will be seen, in one embodiment,
   the method 610 involves obtaining 611 a signal indicative
15 of an A/V output of a peer electronic gaming component and
   controlling 612 the output of an A/V device on the basis
   of the obtained signal.  In another embodiment, the method
   620 involves obtaining 621 interactive data of a peer
   electronic gaming component and controlling 622 an
20 interactive component on the basis of the interactivity
   data.
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
25 departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.                            In
   particular, it will be appreciated that various features
   of the above embodiments can be combined to form other
   embodiments within the scope of the invention.

   description of the invention, except where the context
   requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
   implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as
   "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
