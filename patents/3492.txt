                                     68Ge/ 68Ga  Generator
The present invention relates to a germanium-68/gallium-68 (68Ge/ 68Ga) generator for a
 continuous production of a    68Ga  daughter nuclide, in accordance with the preamble of
claim 1. The invention further relates to the use of at least one oxide of a metal being
selected from the group consisting of Vanadium, Niobium and Tantalum in accordance
with claim 16.
68
    Ga is a highly attractive positron-emitting radionuclide which meanwhile plays an
important role in the use of Positron Emission Tomography (PET). For a brief
introduction and summary of the use of            68Ga, and in particular its chelating with
DOTATOC, in diagnostics it is referred to applicant's EP 2 439 747 B1.
                              Background / Prior art technology
In providing pure radionuclides, element-specific adsorbents are of great interest. This
is also true for different fields of the chemical science. However, of special interest is
the application of such materials for isolation and production of radionuclides for
analytical and medical use.
A key example of the pharmaceutical application of germanium specific materials is a
68
   Ge/ 68Ga radionuclide generator system. Such radionuclide generators are e.g.
described in EP 2 216 789 Al.
The     68Ge/ 68Ga radionuclide generators are based on adsorption of the radionuclide
68
   Ge on a germanium-specific material. Relatively long-lived        68Ge   (T% = 270.82 d)
produces an intermediate short-lived isotope          68Ga (T% = 67.6 min). While    68Ge is
immobilized on a support material continuously formed        68Ga can be repeatedly eluted
(produced).
68
   Ga is a positron emitter (PI branching = 89 %), which can be used for preparation of
radiopharmaceuticals via coordinative labelling. During the last years tumour imaging

                                                  2/20
 using   68Ga-labelled   DOTA-conjugated peptides has become an established approach to
diagnose neuroendocrine and other tumours and metastases using PET and PET/CT. A
 key advantage (cost, logistic advantages) in medical use of           68
                                                                         Ga is its availability via
68
    Ge/ 68 Ga radionuclide generators [1,2].
 Essential quality parameters for        68Ge/ 68Ga  radionuclide generators of the prior art are
 undesired breakthrough of         68Ge,  elution yield and elution stability of 68
                                                                                    Ga. A limit for
68
    Ge breakthrough is given in the European Pharmacopoeia monograph [3] along with
other parameters to measure the pharmaceutical quality of              68Ga  eluate. Elution yield
                             68
and elution stability of        Ga are important factors for the efficiency and shelf life of the
68
    Ge/ 68Ga generator. For successful radiolabelling of pharmaceuticals with            68
                                                                                           Ga the
         68
used       Ga preparations must satisfy high requirements to chemical and radiochemical
quality.    68Ga  must be produced in its "ionic" form (i.e., without any complexing agents).
68
    Ga preparations can be used for coordinative labelling only with low volume and low
acidity. The preparation must be free from metallic impurities which are strong
competitors for the incorporation of gallium into biomolecules [4-6].
The current      68Ge/68Ga    radionuclide generator systems available on the global market
are based on the application of inorganic ion-exchangers or organic molecules as
adsorbents (Table 1). Most commonly used inorganic ion-exchangers are TiO 2
(Cyclotron Company, Russian Federation and Eckert & Ziegler Isotope Products,
Germany) and SnO 2 (iThemba Labs, South Africa). Characteristic for these generator
types is contamination of 68Ga preparation with the trace of other metals from the used
support materials and requirement of high acidity and/or large volume of the eluant.
Thus, for the preparation of         68Ga-labelled  radiopharmaceuticals utilizing the available
metal oxide based radionuclide generator systems of the prior art, pre-processing of the
              68
achieved        Ga eluate is necessary [5-8].
An alternative to inorganic ion-exchangers are organic polymers with introduced single
molecules with functional groups that have a high affinity for germanium, as described
in EP 2 439 747 B1.          Such molecules can be pyrogallol, catechol, etc., which form
strong complexes with germanium via phenolic hydroxyl groups. The key example is the
                    68
only metal-free       Ge/ 6 8Ga radionuclide generator system on the market (ITG Isotope
Technologies Garching GmbH, Germany) which is based on the application of
pyrogallol-derivatized Si0      2 as adsorbent [7,9] (Table 1). Such generators are described
in detail in applicant's EP 2 439 747 B1.              This prior art's  68Ge/ 68Ga   radionuclide

                                                  3 / 20
 generator already allows efficient radiolabelling of biomolecules without the need of pre
 purification of the      68
                            Ga eluate. However, the organic-based adsorbents applied in
 radionuclide generator systems are radiolytically unstable when exposed to high doses
 of radiation. Thus, the advanced chemical stability of the adsorbent plays the important
 role in developing a        68Ge/ 6 8Ga  generator for advanced performance in higher         68
                                                                                                 Ge
 activities.
    In general, some factors related to the properties of the adsorbent of              68
                                                                                          Ge/ 68Ga
   generator affect on the critical quality parameters of           68
                                                                      Ga eluate. Low chemical
   stability of adsorbent increases the breakthrough of          68
                                                                   Ge in the conditions of high
   radiolytical stress. Moreover, during the shelf life of a generator         68
                                                                                 Ge activity zone
   moves via elutions along the adsorbent column making germanium prone to be partly
   diffused inside the crystal lattice defects of metal oxides or the network of carbon
   chains of pyrogallol-derivatives and silica. These diffusion phenomena are likely to
   be factors which cause the decrease of elution yield of 6 8Ga via elutions being typical
   for the   68 Ge/68Ga  generators on the market.
Taking into consideration the prior art of EP 2 439 747 B1, it is the object of the present
 invention to provide an improved            68Ge/ 6 8Ga radionuclide generator which shows a
negligible breakthrough of         68Ge   during elution of  68Ga,  which is stable to radiolysis,
particularly when higher       68
                                 Ge activities are concerned, and simultaneously providing a
high yield of 68Ga and finally, which is essentially of undesired impurities.
                                      68
This object is achieved by a            Ge/68Ga generator in accordance with claim 1 and by a
use of an oxide of a metal being selected from the group consisting of: Vanadium,

          A preferred embodiment of the present invention is a

          wherein M represents Vanadium, Niobium or Tantalum.
The particularly preferred oxide used in the present invention is tantalum pentaoxide
(Ta 2 0 5 ), which can be used in its alpha- and/or beta-crystalline form.
The oxide used as support material in the present invention is obtainable by hydrolyzing
a metal halogenide of the general formula (2):

bromine, or iodine; and converting a metal hydroxide resulting from the hydrolysis to the
desired metal oxide by annealing.

Alternatively, in accordance with the present invention, the desired oxide is also
 obtainable by annealing a metal powder under oxygen atmosphere, wherein said metal
 is selected from the group consisting of: Vanadium, Niobium and Tantalum, wherein
Tantalum is preferred as metal and the resulting oxide is Ta 2 0 5 .
 It is a further preferred embodiment of the present invention that the oxide particle size
distribution is 5 pm to 300 pm, in particular 10 pm to 200 pm.

Typically, the      Ge parent nuclide is adsorbed to the oxide support material in form of
68
    Ge(IV) cations, in particular 68Ge-aquo cations, both of which are easily available.
In accordance with a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the       68
                                                                                Ga is eluted
from the    68Ge/ 68Ga  generator with 0,01 M to 0,1 M HCl, in particular with 0,05 M HCI.
It is a further preferred embodiment of the present invention that the breakthrough of
68
   Ge is < 10- %, in particular < 10~ %, preferably < 10-7 % at an initial activity of 1000
MBq and < 4 X 10~7 % at an initial activity of 2000 MBq. This is far below the required
European Pharmacopoeia [11] values, and far below any 6 8Ge/ 68Ga generator available
on the market (cf. Table 1 below).
Typical elution yields of 68Ga are more than 65 %.
The present invention relates to the use of a novel germanium specific adsorbent, i.e.
an oxide belonging to the group of metal oxides wherein the metal can be Vanadium,
Niobium and Tantalum. Also mixed metal oxides or mixtures of different oxides can be
used. Particularly, the pentoxides have proved to be suitable adsorbents for Ge in
                 68
general and        Ge, specifically. Although, all of the oxides from the above Vanadium
group metals are generally working as specific germanium adsorbents, in practices, it
has turned out that tantalum pentoxide (Ta 2 0 5 ) is the most preferred one. The
adsorbents in accordance with the present invention can be synthesized via a
hydrolysis route from its corresponding pentachlorides, e.g. tantalum pentachloride or
via an annealing route from a metal powder of V, Nb, or Ta or a mixture thereof,
wherein tantalum powder is preferably used. The oxidations of the metal powders are

 adsorbents in accordance with the present invention allows an improved production
 possibility of medical positron emitting radionuclide          68
                                                                  Ga via a novel     68

 radionuclide generator. The chemical nature of the adsorbents enable efficient
                 68
 adsorption of      Ge, efficient and stable desorption of    68
                                                                Ga, very low breakthrough of
 68
    Ge and high labelling efficiency of biomolecules with      68Ga. Compared to the current
 systems based on other metal oxide adsorbents of the prior art, e.g. TiO 2 or SnO 2 , the
desired radionuclide      68
                            Ga can be produced directly (i.e. without any pre-processing)
with    high chemical       and   radiochemical   purity for preparation    of    68Ga-labelled
 radiopharmaceuticals. Moreover, the adsorbents are chemically inert and stable against
radiolysis which allows it to be successfully applied in radionuclide generators of high
activities with improved performance.
Up to date, there exists no literature on the use of metal oxides of the vanadium group
of the periodic table of elements, in particular, tantalum pentoxide, as adsorbent in a
radiopharmaceutical radionuclide generator of the          68
                                                             Ge/ 68Ga type. In addition, the
synthesis of the metal oxides in accordance with the present invention such as the
tantalum pentoxide adsorbent by the below disclosed method is suitable for the purpose
of the      present    invention.   The   achieved     adsorbents    underwent     a  thorough
characterization by different solid state techniques, such as x-ray diffraction, scanning
electron    microscopy, Fourier-transform       infrared spectrometry     and surface area
measurement via Brunauer-Emmet-Teller method. This encompassing analysis has
yielded a well-characterized adsorbent with optimized critical parameters elutability of
68
   Ga, breakthrough of 6 8Ge, capacity of adsorbent, and labelling properties.

selected from the group of vanadium oxide, niobium oxide and tanatalum oxide,
 particularly tantalum pentoxide (Ta2 0 5 ) in a     68Ge/68 Ga   radionuclide generator. The

The following synthesis method is described by way of example for the manufacture of
tantalum pentoxide as the most preferred metal oxide in accordance with the present
invention. However, those having average skill in the art will understand that the present
synthesis method easily can be applied to the manufacture of the other preferred
embodiments of the present invention, namely vanadium pentoxide and niobium
pentoxide, particularly due to their close chemical properties.

A synthesis method for the Ta 2 0 5 adsorbent was developed by the applicant using two

material.

 Hydrolysis of TaCI5         was performed in water using controlled water/TaC 5 ratio.
 Temperature of water during the hydrolysis process was adjusted and kept stable in

parameters correlating to adsorption and desorption properties of               68Ge   and    68

respectively, were investigated (Table 3). These parameters included crystal structure
and surface morphology of the Ta 2 0 5 , surface area and particle size distribution. The
results obtained by radiochemical analysis for            68Ge    (distribution factor (KD)      and
capacity) and for     68Ga   (elutability) were correlated by the observations and results
obtained by analytical techniques such as x-ray diffraction (XRD) applied for crystal

 1 Particles of < 8 pm diameter separated
Tetravalent germanium exists in generator-relevant solution pH (0.05 M HCI) and Ge
concentrations ([Getotai    < 0.005 M) in the form of germanic acid (Ge(OH) 4) [12,13]. In
these conditions germanium binds with hydroxyl groups on the surface of tantalum
pentoxide [14]. Experiments have indicated a clear positive correlation between small
particle size and high surface area to efficient adsorption of         68Ge.  On the other hand,
small particle size has a negative effect on the efficiency of elutability of       68Ga.   That is

why the main goals in the development of the synthesis method for Ta 2 0 5 have been to
minimize the formation of small particles (< 10 pm), and to increase the surface area of
Ta 2 0 5 particles. In the Figure 4 one can see the difference in the surfaces of the two
crystalline forms of Ta 2 0 5 : the particles formed of P-Ta 20 5 (Fig. 4A) have surface
covered with caves and formations formed during the aggressive chemical conditions of
                                                                                           68Ge
hydrolysis; thus providing higher surface area and higher KD and capacity for
compared to the particles of a-Ta 20 5 (Fig. 4B) where these morphological structures
have "melted" due to high annealing temperature. On the other hand, the glossy surface
                                                                                   68
characteristics of the a-Ta 20 5 effects provide better elutability properties for   Ga.
In conclusion: the aim has been to develop a method of synthesis for Ta 20 5 adsorbent
                                                                68
with the ideal equilibrium between efficient adsorption of        Ge (shelf life) and efficient
elutability of 68Ga (elution yield).
A batch of germanium specific adsorbent was synthesised by following the hydrolysis
route:
Tantalum pentachloride (TaCI5 ) was mixed with hot water (80 'C, solid/liquid ratio 20
g/L) to produce tantalum hydroxide (Ta(OH)5 ), which was annealed under 900 *C over
24 h in order to form crystalline tantalum oxide (Ta 20 5 ). After isolation of particles with a
size range of 10 pm - 200 pm the final material was used as an adsorbent for the
68
   Ge/ 68Ga generators.
Two generator columns were filled with a known amount of the adsorbent (8 g). The
columns were loaded with a known amount of 68Ge (1000 MBq, 2000 MBq) and stable
Ge (total mass of Ge = 80 pg). The radionuclide generators were produced under GMP
conditions.
The    68Ge/ 68Ga   generators were subjected to an elution program and the critical
parameters were followed. At the current stage of the elution program the following
values related to the critical parameters are valid:
- Current total cumulative elution volume: 700 mL (1000 MBq), 400 mL (2000 MBq)
- Elution yield of 68Ga: > 65 %, stable
                - Currently: 70 % (1000 MBq), 73 % (2000 MBq) (Figure 2)

 - Elution volume: 6 mL (Figure 6)
 - Breakthrough of 68Ge:      < 10~6 % (level of Ph. Eur.: 10- %)
                  - Currently: 10~7 % (1000 MBq), 4 x 10~7 % (2000 MBq) (Figure 1)
 - Labelling efficiency: > 96 % after 90 h of ingrowth period via direct elution (68Ga
 DOTA-TOC) (Figure 3).

 In general, some factors related to the properties of the adsorbent of                 68
                                                                                           Ge/68 Ga
generator affect on the critical quality parameters of        68
                                                                Ga eluate. Low chemical stability
of adsorbent increases the breakthrough of           68Ge  in the conditions of high radiolytical
stress. Moreover, during the shelf life of a generator            68Ge  activity zone moves via
elutions along the adsorbent column making germanium prone to be partly diffused
inside the crystal lattice defects of metal oxides or the network of carbon chains of
pyrogallol-derivatives and silica. These diffusion phenomena are likely to be factors
which cause the decrease of elution yield of        68Ga  via elutions being typical for the prior
art  68Ge/ 68Ga   generators on the market.
Tantalum pentoxide was originally chosen to be used as adsorbent for two main
reasons: It is chemically inert and stable material, which makes it suitable to be applied
in conditions of high radiolysis and surprisingly yielding low breakthrough of                68Ge
(Figure 1). Moreover, the fact that the tantalum cation is (primarily) in pentavalent
oxidation state was regarded to be beneficial for the            68Ga  elution yield stability and
preventative against the diffusion of tetravalent germanium into the crystal lattice of the
Ta 2 0 5 (Figure 2). Evidence of these properties, i.e., chemical stability and nature can be
seen in the Figures 1 and 2 presenting the behavior of breakthrough of           68
                                                                                   Ge and elution
yield of   68Ga    in the GMP generator and Ta2 0 5 generator in function of cumulative
elution volume, respectively.

Labelling properties of a radiopharmaceutical
synthesized Ta 2 0 5 adsorbent were tested by a method based on the monograph of
                                                                     68Ga  eluate eluted from a
European Pharmacopoeia [11]. The test was performed for
generator with the nominal       68
                                   Ge activity of 1900 MBq and ingrowth time (time of no
elutions) of 90 hours. The aim of the test was to demonstrate the stability of the Ta 2 0 5
adsorbent against radiolysis even during a longer period of time of no elutions. The
results obtained by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) from the direct
labelling were over 96 % yield of labelled product. This clearly demonstrates the
extensive stability of the Ta 2 0 5 adsorbent used in a     68
                                                              Ge/ 68Ga generator, and indicates
that no rinsing after weekends is necessary in order to yield a fully functional generator
for the use of radiolabelling (Figure 3).

 following values related to the critical parameters are shown in Figs. 6, 7, and 8:

   common    68Ga   PET tracers, such as PSMA-1 1 (HBED-CC) and DOTATATE showed

    Based on calculation of the specific activity of 100 GBq/mg         68Ge  and the nominal
   total applicable Germanium amount on 8-9 g Ta 205 Generator columns, it is
   possible to load generators with 8000 MBq of                68Ge  (corresponds to 80 pg
   Germanium).
   Similar elution profiles, breakthrough values, yields (data not shown) as specified in
   Examples 1 and 2 could be achieved when replacing the Ta 205 by its corresponding
   oxides Nb20 5and V2 05 . The synthesis thereof follows essentially the same routes as
   described in Example 1 above.

   in sufficient quantity and reliable quality can be fulfilled.
