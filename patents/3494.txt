            Embodiments of the present invention relate to fabrics that provide ballistic
protection as well as garments made from such fabrics.
                                       BACKGROUND
       In combat environments, much attention is focused on preventing injuries
caused by relatively large projectiles and fragmentation, such as those emanating from
improvised explosive devices. However, significant damage can also be caused by
ejecta (small particles of sand and other fine grain projectiles typically moving between
500-1200 ft./sec.) that penetrate through garments and harm underlying skin and
tissue. If left in skin and tissue, the ejecta can cause infection which can ultimately lead
to amputation of the affected area.         While a number of ballistic fabrics have been
developed and provide protection, none do so while still being comfortable to the
wearer and dyeable/printable.         Thus, there is a need to provide fabrics that afford
protection against ejecta while being comfortable to the wearer and dyeable/printable.
       The ability of a fabric to protect against ejecta is measured pursuant to the testing
methodology set forth in MIL-STD-662F, Department of Defense Test Method Standard,

                               DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        Fabrics according to embodiments of this invention have fibers and constructions
that enhance the ballistic protection of the fabric.           Fabrics according to some
embodiments of this invention may also be, but do not have to be, flame resistant. For
example, the fabrics may comply with the thermal protective requirements set forth in
NFPA 2112 (2007), including having acceptable char lengths (as measured with the
testing method set forth in ASTM D6413), as well as GL-PD-07-12 Rev. 5 (Sept. 28, 2012)
and GL-PD-10-02C (Sept. 1, 2010), the entirety of which are hereby incorporated by
reference.
        In some embodiments, the fabric includes fibers that enhance the ballistic
protection of the fabric (referred to as "ballistic fibers").   The ballistic fibers may be
stretch broken ballistic fibers, staple ballistic fibers (including long and short staple),
and/or filament ballistic fibers, or a combination of such fibers. The ballistic fibers used
in some embodiments of the fabrics contemplated herein include, but are not limited to,
para-aramid fibers, ultra-high density polyethylene fibers, polybenzoxazole (PBO)
fibers, carbon fibers, silk fibers, polyamide fibers, polyester fibers, and poly{2 ,6
diimidazo[4,5-b:40; 50-e]-pyridinylene-1,4(2,5-dihydroxy)phenylene}         ("PIPD") fibers.
Examples     of  para-aramid    fibers  include   KEVLARTM      (available from     DuPont),
TECHNORATM (available from Teijin Twaron BV of Arnheim, Netherlands), and
TWARONTM (also available from Teijin Twaron BV).            Examples of ultra-high density
polyethylene fibers include Dyneema and Spectra. An example of a polyester fiber is

     WO 2014/143346                                                   PCT/US2013/077528
VECTRANTM        (available from Kuraray).     An example of a PIPD fiber includes M5
(available from Dupont).
        In some embodiments, the fabrics are formed from 100% ballistic fibers.          For
example, all of the yarns in the fabric may be formed with 100% of a single type of
ballistic fiber or alternatively a blend of different ballistic fibers.   Moreover, yarns
formed from 100% ballistic fibers may be all or an intimate blend of staple fibers, a
combination of filament fibers, or a combination of filament fibers and staple fibers.
        In other embodiments, the fabric includes ballistic fibers (such as those disclosed
above) and one or more types of secondary fibers that are used to enhance a secondary
property     of    the   fabric    other   than   ballistic  protection    (e.g.,  comfort,
dyeability/printability, etc.) (referred to as "secondary fibers"). The secondary fibers
can be staple or filament fibers and can be flame resistant or used in their non-flame
resistant state (to the extent possible). For example, some embodiments of the fabric
may be formed from yarns having 100% ballistic fibers (such as those disclosed above)
and yarns that include one or more types of secondary fibers (either in addition to, or to
the exclusion of, ballistic fibers). In other embodiments, yarns forming the fabric are
formed from a blend of one or more ballistic fibers (such as those disclosed above) and
one or more types of secondary fibers. The blended yarns may be a combination of
spun fibers, a combination of filament fibers, or a combination of filament fibers and
staple fibers.
        Such secondary fibers can be selected to enhance a property of the fabric, such as,
but not limited to, the comfort, durability, and/or dyeability/printability of the fabric.

        Secondary fibers that enhance the comfort of the fabric (i.e., have higher moisture
regain, soft hand, etc.) are referred to herein as "comfort fibers." "Comfort fibers" as
used herein include, but are not limited to, cellulosic fibers, polybenzimidazole (PBI)
fibers, TANLONTM (available from Shanghai Tanlon Fiber Company), rayon, wool, and
blends thereof. Examples of cellulosic fibers include cotton, rayon, acetate, triacetate,
MODALTM, and lyocell fibers (as well as their flame resistant counterparts FR cotton, FR
rayon, FR acetate, FR triacetate, and FR lyocell). An example of a suitable rayon fiber is
Viscose by Lenzing, available from Lenzing Fibers Corporation. Examples of lyocell
fibers include TENCEL G100 TM and TENCEL A100 TM, both available from Lenzing
Fibers Corporation. Examples of FR rayon fibers include Lenzing FRTM and Lenzing
RFTM, also available from Lenzing Fibers Corporation, and VISILTM, available from
Sateri.
        Secondary fibers that enhance the dyeability/ printability of the fabric are
referred to herein as "dyeable fibers" and include fibers that are dyeable and dyestuff
printable (as opposed to pigment printable). "Dyeable fibers" as used herein include,
but are not limited to, modacrylic fibers, cellulosic fibers, meta-aramid fibers,
polybenzimidazole (PBI) fibers, melamine fibers, TANLONTM (available from Shanghai
Tanlon Fiber Company), rayon, polyester, polyvinyl alcohol, wool, polyetherimide,
polyethersulfone, polyamide, and blends thereof. An example of suitable modacrylic
fibers are PROTEXTM fibers available from Kaneka Corporation of Osaka, Japan, SEFTM
available from Solutia, or blends thereof. Examples of cellulosic fibers include cotton,
rayon, acetate, triacetate, MODALTM, and lyocell fibers (as well as their flame resistant

     WO 2014/143346                                                     PCT/US2013/077528
counterparts FR cotton, FR rayon, FR acetate, FR triacetate, and FR lyocell). An example
of a suitable rayon fiber is Modal by Lenzing, available from Lenzing Fibers
Corporation. Examples of lyocell fibers include TENCEL G100 TM and TENCEL A100 T M ,
both available from Lenzing Fibers Corporation. Examples of FR rayon fibers include
Lenzing FRTM and Lenzing RFTM, also available from Lenzing Fibers Corporation, and
VISILTM,   available from Sateri.   Examples of meta-aramid fibers include NOMEXTM
(available from DuPont), CONEXTM (available from Teijin), and Kermel (available from
Kermel). An example of melamine fibers is BASOFILTM (available from Basofil Fibers).
        In some embodiments, the ballistic fibers comprise 25-100% and the secondary
fibers (comfort fibers, dyeable fibers, or some combination of both) comprise 0-75% of
the fibers in the fabric. In some embodiments, the ballistic fibers comprise 25-80% and
the secondary fibers (comfort fibers, dyeable fibers, or some combination of both)
comprise 20-75% of the fibers in the fabric. In some embodiments, the ballistic fibers
comprise 45-70% and the secondary fibers (comfort fibers, dyeable fibers, or some
combination of both) comprise 30-55% of the fibers in the fabric. In some embodiments,
the ballistic fibers comprise 40-60% and the secondary fibers comprise 40-60% of the
fibers in the fabric. It may be, but will not always be, the case that, to the extent a
smaller percentage of ballistic fibers are used in the fabric, the fabric weight may need
to be increased to achieve the desired ballistic protection.
        The fabric may also include fibers in addition to the ballistic and secondary fibers
identified above. For example, some fabric embodiments may also include fibers that
enhance static dissipation of the fabric (referred to herein as "antistat fibers").
                                              6

     WO 2014/143346                                                       PCT/US2013/077528
Examples of antistat fibers can include, but are not limited to, fibers having a carbon
core surrounded by a nylon or polyester sheath.              An example of an antistat fiber
includes No-Shock@ (available from Ascend Performance Materials), and an example of
an antistat filament yarn includes Mega-Stat@ (available from Barnet).
       The yarns in the fabric may be spun or filament yarns and can comprise a single
yarn or two or more individual yarns that are combined together in some form,
including, but not limited to, twisting, plying, tacking, wrapping, covering, core
spinning (i.e., a filament or spun core at least partially surrounded by spun fibers or
yarns), etc.
       In some embodiments, the fabrics can be formed entirely from yarns having
identical fiber blends (i.e., all of the yarns in the fabric are the same) such that the fabrics
have the overall blends of ballistic and secondary fibers set forth above.               Where
identical yarns are used, the fabrics may be formed by traditional weaving technology
and traditional knitting technology           (e.g., warp knits with various styles and
constructions (such as raschel, tricot, and simplex) and weft knits with various styles
and constructions (such as flat bed and circular knits, such as double knits (including
swiss pique, rib, interlock, etc.) and single knits (including jersey and pique))).
       However, in other embodiments, the yarns forming the fabric may not all be
identical. For example, it may be desirable to form the fabric from a first type of yarn
engineered more for ballistic protection (hereinafter referred to as the "ballistic yarns")
and a second type of yarn engineered more for a secondary property, such as comfort
and/or dyeability/printability (hereinafter referred to as the "secondary yarns").

     WO 2014/143346                                                     PCT/US2013/077528
        Use of the terms "ballistic yarns" and "secondary yarns" is not meant to suggest
that the ballistic yarns do not or cannot impart comfort and/or dyeability/printability
or that the secondary yarns do not or cannot impart any ballistic protection.             The
ballistic yarns may include a higher percentage of ballistic fibers than the secondary
yarns to impart ballistic protection to the fabric, and the secondary yarns may include a
higher percentage of secondary fibers (comfort fibers or dyeable fibers) to impart
comfort and dyeability/printability, respectively, to the fabric. However, such may not
always be the case.
        The ballistic yarns may be formed of one type of ballistic fiber or formed from a
combination of fibers (ballistic fibers, secondary fibers, antistat fibers, or other types of
fibers). The ballistic yarns may be spun or filament yarns and can comprise a single
yarn or two or more individual yarns that are combined together in some form,
including, but not limited to, twisting, plying, tacking, wrapping, covering, core
spinning (i.e., a filament or spun core at least partially surrounded by spun fibers or
yarns), etc.
        In some embodiments, the ballistic yarns are formed with 100% ballistic filament
yarns. In some embodiments, the ballistic yarns include 100% para-aramid filament
yarns.     In other embodiments, the ballistic yarns include 100% high density
polyethylene filament yarns.
        The ballistic yarns may also be spun yarns.            In one such non-limiting
embodiment, the ballistic yarns are formed of a blend of 80-100% para-aramid fibers
and 0-20% cellulosic fibers. In another embodiment, the ballistic yarns are formed of a
                                              8

     WO 2014/143346                                                      PCT/US2013/077528
blend of 50-80% para-aramid fibers and 20-50% cellulosic fibers. Additional fiber types
(including, but not limited to, other of the ballistic fibers, comfort fibers, dyeable fibers,
antistat fibers, etc.) may also be included in such blends.
        The secondary yarns may be formed of one type of secondary fiber or formed
from a combination of fibers (ballistic fibers, secondary fibers, antistat fibers, or other
types of fibers). In some embodiments, the secondary yarns include a combination of
fibers. The secondary yarns may be spun or filament yarns and can comprise a single
yarn or two or more individual yarns that are combined together in some form,
including, but not limited to, twisting, plying, tacking, wrapping, covering, core
spinning (i.e., a filament or spun core at least partially surrounded by spun fibers or
yarns), etc.
         Exemplary but non-limiting combinations of secondary yarns include, but are
not limited to: (i) 20-100% cellulosic fibers and 0-80% para-aramid fibers; (ii) 20-50%
cellulosic fibers and 50-80% para-aramid fibers; (iii) 30-50% cellulosic fibers, 30-50%
modacrylic fibers, and 0-40% para-aramid fibers; (iv) 20-100% meta-aramid fibers and 0
80% cellulosic fibers; (v) 20-100% nylon fibers and 0-80% cellulosic fibers; and (vi) 20
100% modacrylic fibers and 0-80% cellulosic fibers.            Such blends may be tailored
depending      on      the  desired    secondary    property     of   the   fabric   (comfort,
dyeability/printability, etc.). Moreover, such blends may also include other fibers types
(including, but not limited to, other of the ballistic fibers, comfort fibers, and/or dyeable
fibers identified above).

     WO 2014/143346                                                    PCT/US2013/077528
        The ballistic yarns may be combined with secondary yarns in various ways to
form various fabric embodiments. Yarns formed of differing fiber blends (e.g., ballistic
and secondary yarns) may be woven or knitted in different ways, some of which result
in different properties being imparted to different sides of the fabric.
        For example and with respect to weaving, one of the warp or fill yarns could be
of the ballistic yarns and the other of the warp or fill yarns could be of the secondary
yarns. The fabric could be woven (such as via a twill or Satin weave construction) so
that the warp and fill yarns (and thus the ballistic and secondary yarns) are exposed
predominantly on opposing sides of the fabric.        In this way, one side of the fabric
contributes more ballistic protection while the other side of the fabric contributes more
of the desired secondary property (comfort, dyeability/printability, etc., depending on
the make-up of the secondary yarns). In other embodiments, not all of the warp or fill
yarns are the same. For example, ballistic and secondary yarns may be provided in
both the warp and fill directions by providing ballistic yarns on some ends and picks
and secondary yarns on other ends and picks (in any sort of random arrangement or
alternating pattern). Or all of the yarns in one of the warp or fill direction could be
identical and different yarns used only in the other of the warp or fill direction.
        Similarly and with respect to knitting, ballistic yarns may be knitted with
secondary yarns in a variety of ways. The ballistic and secondary yarns may be knitted
using single knit technology (e.g., plating) or double-knit technology such that the
ballistic yarns will be located primarily on one side of the fabric to enhance ballistic
protection and the secondary yarns will be located primarily on the opposing side of the
                                             10

      WO 2014/143346                                                 PCT/US2013/077528
fabric to enhance comfort or dyeability/printability (or whatever secondary property
the secondary yarn is tailored to have) to the fabric.
        In yet another embodiment, the ballistic and secondary yarns are knitted so that
alternating courses and/or wales of the fabric are formed by different yarn types. In
still yet another embodiment, the fabric may be knitted (such as using double-knit
plating technology) such that one of the ballistic and secondary yarns is embedded
within the fabric so as not to be exposed on a fabric surface and the other of the ballistic
and secondary yarns is exposed on both sides of the fabric. In some embodiments, the
ballistic yarn is embedded in the fabric to enhance the ballistic protection of the fabric
while leaving the secondary yarns exposed on the fabric surface to enhance the comfort
or dyeablity/printability to the fabric.
        Fabrics formed of ballistic and secondary yarns provided on opposing sides of
the fabric may be oriented in a variety of ways within a garment, depending on the use
of the garment. For example, if incorporated into garments where it is desirable that the
exterior of the garment be dyed or printed (e.g., camouflage), it may useful to
incorporate secondary yarns into the fabric and expose the side of the fabric with the
secondary yarns (which will typically be more conducive to dyeing and/or printing) on
the exterior of the garment and the ballistic yarns facing the wearer. Alternatively, if
dyeing or printing of the fabric is of no consequence, it may be desirable to incorporate
secondary yarns into the fabric and position the side of the fabric with the secondary
yarns (which will typically be more comfortable) in the garment so that the comfort
yarns are facing the wearer.

     WO 2014/143346                                                  PCT/US2013/077528
        In some embodiments, it may be desirable, but certainly not required, to
incorporate stretchable yarns ("stretch yarns") into the fabrics, which may improve the
ballistic protection of the fabrics. Stretch yarns may be yarns formed from inherently
elastic materials such as spandex (elastane), ethylene-olefin copolymer, rubber or
similar elastomeric-type materials        or alternatively could be formed from non
inherently stretchable yarns (e.g., nylon yarns, polyester yarns, etc.) that have been
chemically or physically altered (such as via crimping, texturing, etc.) to render them
elastic or stretchable. Examples of spandex fibers include LYCRATM (available from
Invista),   DORLASTANTM        (available   from AsahiKasei    Spandex    America),    and
RadiciSpandex.      Examples of ethylene-olefin copolymer fibers include Dow XLATM
composite fibers.
        In some embodiments, the stretch yarns are filament yarns formed from the
elastomeric fibers disclosed above. The stretch yarns are not particularly durable or
resistant to heat and fire and thus tend to degrade or melt from exposure to such
extreme conditions. Thus, it may be desirable, but certainly not required, to orient other
yarns or fibers that do have some heat/flame resistance at least partially around the
stretch yarns so as to protect them. The flame resistant yarns (which may include the
ballistic and/or secondary yarns disclosed above) may be oriented at least partially
around the stretch yarns, such as via plying or helically wrapping the stretch yarns.
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,527,597 and 5,694,981 (both of which are incorporated herein in their
entirety) illustrate fabric configurations whereby stretch yarns are helically wrapped
with flame resistant yarns to form a protected stretch yarn (see Figure 1).       A single

flame resistant yarn or multiple flame resistant yarns may be used to wrap a stretch
yarn. In an alternative embodiment, flame resistant fibers may be spun around the
stretch yarn so as to form a protective sheath about the stretch yarns. Again, however,
it certainly is not required that the stretch yarns be so protected.
        For woven fabrics, the stretch yarns may be provided in the warp and/or fill
direction or in both directions.
        For knitted fabrics, the stretch yarns may be incorporated in a variety of ways. In
some embodiments, the stretch yarns may be knitted with the other yarns (such as those
described above) using standard knitting techniques, including plating.            In some
embodiments, not all courses or wales include a stretch yarn. By way only of example,
stretch yarns may be provided only in alternating courses or wales.                In other
embodiments, the stretch yarns are "laid in" during the knitting process. In one such
non-limiting configuration, the stretch yarns are not technically knitted with the other
yarns but rather are inserted during the knitting process and essentially trapped by the
knit structure so as to be retained in the fabric.
        Blends of the ballistic and secondary fibers disclosed herein may also be used to
form a nonwoven fabric. In some embodiments, the ballistic fibers comprise 25-100%
and the secondary fibers (comfort fibers, dyeable fibers, or some combination of both)
comprise 0-75% of the fibers in the fabric. In some embodiments, the ballistic fibers
comprise 25-80% and the secondary fibers (comfort fibers, dyeable fibers, or some
combination of both) comprise 20-75% of the fibers in the fabric. In some embodiments,
the ballistic fibers comprise 45-70% and the secondary fibers (comfort fibers, dyeable

fibers, or some combination of both) comprise 30-55% of the fibers in the fabric.      In
some embodiments, the ballistic fibers comprise 40-60% and the secondary fibers
comprise 40-60% of the fibers in the fabric. In some embodiments, front/back lapping
may be used to form the nonwoven fabric such that the nonwoven fabric has a different
blend on the face versus the back of the nonwoven fabric. In some embodiments, the
nonwoven fabric is formed with multiple layers. The nonwoven fabric may be formed
with any number of layers. Moreover, the fiber blend of the various layers can be, but
may not be, the same. Moreover, layers having different fiber blends may be oriented
within the nonwoven fabric in any order (e.g., ABAB, ABCABC, ABACABAC, etc.,
where A, B, and C are each a layer utilizing a unique fiber blend).
        Ballistic fabrics contemplated herein may consist of a single ply of the woven,
knitted, or nonwoven fabrics disclosed herein or alternatively may be formed with
multiple plies of such fabrics, by means of quilting, laminating, adhering, etc.
        In some embodiments, the fabrics contemplated herein have a weight greater
than 2.5 ounces/yd 2 and less than 12.5 ounces/yd 2, inclusive. In some embodiments,
the fabrics contemplated herein have a weight of between 2.5-11 ounces/yd 2, between
5-9 ounces/yd 2, and between 5-7 ounces/yd 2, inclusive. In some embodiments, the
fabrics have a weight of 6 ounces/yd 2, 8.5 ounces/yd 2, or 11 ounces/yd 2.
        Embodiments of the fabrics may be tested pursuant to the V5 o Ballistic Test set
forth in MIL-STD-662F, Department of Defense Test Method Standard, V5 o Ballistic Test
for Armor, December 18, 1997.

1. SCOPE
      1.1 Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to provide general guidelines for
procedures, equipment, physical conditions, and terminology for determining the ballistic
resistance of metallic, nonmetallic and composite armor against small arms projectiles.
The ballistic test procedure described in this standard determines the V50 ballistic limit of
armor.

 3. DEFINITIONS
      3.1 Applique armor. Armor that can be easily installed or removed from a weapon
system in kit form without adversely affecting its structural integrity or operation.
                                          21

WO 2014/143346                                                      PCT/US2013/077528
                                       MIL-STD-662F
      3.2 Areal density. A measure of the weight of armor material per unit area, usually
expressed in pounds per square foot (1b/ft2 ) or kilograms per square meter (kg/M2) Of
surface area.
      3.3 Armor. A shielding material provided for ballistic defeat of projectiles or
fragments when inherent shielding is inadequate.
      3.4 Ballistic acceptance test. A test performed on lot representative samples to
determine whether or not the lot of armor is ballistically acceptable for use in production
armor items.
      3.5 Ballistic coefficient. A parameter or measure which is used to represent or
account for the attenuation of the velocity of a projectile or fragment in transit from the
firing mechanism to the target. "Ballistic coefficients" are normally used in approximate
formulations to determine average speed or times-of-flight for a projectile. For example,
average projectile speed, Vp, can be obtained from:
            Vp = Vo oc R
                exp ( ocR)-1
          where
           Vo = muzzle velocity
           R = range
            oc = ballistic coefficient
      3.6 Ballistic impact. Those impacts due to hits on the target by projectiles,
fragments or other aerodynamically-affected threat mechanisms.
      3.7 Ballistic limit. The minimum velocity at which a particular projectile is expected
to consistently, completely penetrate armor of given thickness and physical properties at
a specified angle of obliquity. The ballistic limit may also be defined as the maximum
velocity at which a particular projectile is expected to consistently fail to penetrate armor
of given thickness and physical properties at a specified angle of obliquity. Because of
the expense of firing tests and the impossibility of controlling striking velocity precisely,
plus the existence of a zone of mixed results in which a projectile may completely
penetrate or only partially penetrate under apparently identical conditions, statistical
approaches are necessary, based upon limited firings. Certain approaches lead to
approximation of the V50 Point, that is, the velocity at which complete penetration and
incomplete penetration are equally likely to occur. Other methods attempt to approximate
the Vo Point, that is, the maximum velocity at which no complete penetration will occur.

                                            MIL-STD-662F
Other methods attempt to approximate the V100 Point, that is, the minimum velocity at
which all projectiles will completely penetrate.
      3.8 Ballistic limit, protection criteria (V5oBL(P)). The V5oBL(P) may be defined as the
average of an equal number of highest partial penetration velocities and the lowest
complete penetration velocities which occur within a specified velocity spread. The
normal up-and-down firing procedure is used. A 0.020 in. (0.51 mm) thick 2024 T3 sheet
of aluminum is placed 6 + 1/2 in. (152 + 12.7 mm) behind and parallel to the target to
witness complete penetrations. Normally, at least two partial and two complete
penetration velocities are used to complete the BL(P). Four, six, and ten-round ballistic
limits are frequently used. The maximum allowable velocity span is dependent on the
armor material and test conditions. Maximum velocity spans of 60, 90, 100 and 125 feet
per second (ft/s) (18, 27, 30 and 38 m/s) are frequently used.
      3.9 Ballistic resistance. A measure of the capability of a material or component to
stop or reduce the impact velocity and mass of an impacting projectile or fragment.

of projectile flight between two fixed measuring stations.
      3.12 Composite armor. An armor system consisting of two or more different armor
materials bonded together to form a protective unit.
      3.13 Fair hits (for ceramic composite armor). The definitions contained herein apply
to the ballistic testing of ceramic composite armor which consists (in part) of ceramic tiles.
            a. Fair hit (center tile) - A fair hit for the center tile of the ceramic composite
armor is an area within one inch (25.4 mm) radius of the center of an undamaged tile.
           b. Fair hit (adjacent tile) - A fair hit in an adjacent tile is a fair hit (center tile) in a
tile that has an edge adjacent to a previously impacted tile whose hit was declared a fair
hit.
           c. Fair hit (joint line) - A fair hit on a joint line is a hit within 0.15 in. (3.8 mm) of a
single joint between two tiles, but no closer than 0.5 in. (12.7 mm) from the intersection of
three or more tiles.

4. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
      4.1 Projectile. The test projectile shall be of the type and caliber specified in the
contract. Millimeters shall be used to identify the caliber of projectiles unless otherwise
specified. Table I provides the velocities (expressed in feet per second) of various
projectiles at specific target distances.
      4.2 Weapon. The weapon(s) used in the ballistic test firing shall be capable of firing
the appropriate projectile at the specified V5oBL(P) velocity range within yaw limitations.
Millimeters shall be used to identify the caliber of weapons unless otherwise specified.
      4.3 Velocity measuring equipment.
      4.3.1 Chronograph. An electronic counter type chronograph measuring to at least
the nearest microsecond (10-6s) shall be used.
      4.3.2 Detectors. Either high-velocity lumiline screens, or electrical contact screens
which either open or close an electrical circuit by passage of the projectile through the
detector shall be used. Contact screens may consist of metallic foils separated by a thin
insulating layer, or may consist of a circuit printed on paper with the circuit spacing such
                                             26

WO 2014/143346                                                         PCT/US2013/077528
                                         MIL-STD-662F
that the projectile passing through the screen will "break" the circuit. Chronograph or
electronic timers used shall be calibrated and certified for accuracy. If accuracy is not
certified, two pairs of velocity screens and two chronograph counters shall be used. This
system enables the computation of an average projectile velocity between each pair of
screens. The difference between the two instrumentation velocities shall be less than or
equal to 10 ft/s (3 m/s); thus, giving greater accuracy in actual average velocity.
      4.3.3 Radar. Doppler radar is used occasionally to check lumiline screens.
      4.4 Propellant. Any propellant which is either standard or suitable for the weapon
shall be used. A projectile velocity-propellant charge curve for the weapon shall be
determined before any testing is performed. This curve is required to provide a basis for
selecting a powder charge to achieve a desired velocity. It is recommended that the
propellant storage and weighing area be maintained at 19-24oC (65-750 F) and 50 + 5%
relative humidity.
      4.5 Test sample mount. The armor test sample shall be secured on the test target
mount with impact side perpendicular to the line-of-flight of the projectile. The frame
supports and clamps or mounting fixtures must be capable of retaining the sample and
withstanding shock resulting from ballistic impact by the test projectiles. The test sample
mount shall be capable of adjustment for moving the sample in the vertical or horizontal
directions so that the point of impact can be located anywhere on the sample, and so that
zero degree obliquity impacts can be achieved anywhere on the sample. The test
sample mount shall be able to rotate on the vertical or horizontal axis so that various
obliquity attack angles can be achieved. The test samples shall be mounted with a
rigidity equal to or greater than the actual installation of the part.
      4.6 Test sample. The sampling plan for ballistic acceptance tests shall be specified
in the contract.
5. DETAILED REQUIREMENTS
      5.1 Test conditions. Unless otherwise specified, all ballistic tests shall be performed
in a standard atmosphere of 23 + 20C (73 + 40F) and 50 + 5% relative humidity.
Temperature and humidity measurements shall be recorded for each firing.
      5.2 Equipment setup.
      5.2.1 Triqqerinq devices. The spacing from the weapon muzzle to the first pair of
triggering devices shall be sufficient to prevent damage from muzzle blast and
obscuration from smoke in case optical devices are used. Recommended distances can
                                            27

WO 2014/143346                                                     PCT/US2013/077528
                                      MIL-STD-662F
be found in ITOP 4-2-805. Spacing between triggering devices is a function of the
expected velocity of the projectile being fired. In many instances, physical restriction,
such as short overall distance from muzzle to test sample, dictates the spacing of the
triggering devices. The last pair of triggering devices shall be placed at least 4 ft (122
cm) in front of test sample and should be protected from possible damage resulting from
fragments.
      5.2.2 Witness plate. The witness plate shall be 0.002 in. (0.05 mm) thick aluminum
sheet for transparent armors and vision devices and 0.020 in. (0.51 mm) thick aluminum
sheet for all other armors. The minimum size of the witness plate shall be 11 in. by 14 in.
(279 mm X 356 mm) and be of sufficient size to be impacted by all fragments resulting
from projectile penetration. The witness plate shall be made of 2024-T3, 2024-T4 or
5052 aluminum alloy sheet, and shall be located 6 + 0.5 in. (150 + 10 mm) behind and
parallel to the armor test sample. When the test sample is a helmet the witness plate
shall be rigidly mounted inside the helmet and 2 in. (51 mm) behind the area of impact
and may be smaller than specified above so that it will fit inside the helmet. When the
target presents a curved surface, such as a visor, the witness plate shall be located 6 +
0.5 in. (150 + 10 mm) behind the target, curved and oriented to maximize the probability
of perpendicular impact.
      5.3 Ballistic test procedure. The procedure listed below is a general description of
the method for obtaining a V5oBL(P). One should note that the actual method to be used
may vary depending on target composition, specification or contract requirement.
      5.3.1 Warm-up for constant velocity. When warmer rounds are needed for weapon
or target alignment or establishment of a specific striking velocity, a test round shall be
fired through the witness plate to determine the exact point of impact. Additional rounds
shall be fired as required until the proper alignment and a stable striking velocity have
been achieved. The propellant charge versus velocity curve for the weapon being used
shall be referred to as a guide for establishing the required velocity within a practical +
tolerance. Normally, this will be about + 25 ft/s (8 m/s).
      5.3.2 Yaw. The test sample shall be mounted as described in 4.5. The point of
impact shall be located on the test sample and shall be positioned to line up with the
previously determined line of flight of the projectile. Yaw shall be measured for each
round by yaw cards, flash radiograph or photography. Any round for which yaw is
determined to be greater than 50 shall be disregarded in the calculation of the ballistic
limit. In the case of a dispute concerning a particular barrel, yaw shall be measured by a
photographic measurement system using a multi-flash light source to determine projectile
velocity and yaw. Yaw shall be measured by the system to an accuracy of 0.5 degree.

      5.3.3 First firing. For acceptance testing, the first round shall be loaded with a
reference propellant charge so that the striking velocity is approximately 75 to 100 ft/s (23
to 30 m/s) above the minimum required V5oBL(P) as given by the appropriate
specification. For most other types of ballistic tests, the first round shall be loaded with a
reference propellant charge where the estimated likelihood of either complete or partial
penetration is 50%.
      5.3.4 Examination of witness plate. The witness plate shall be examined for
penetration by holding it up to a light to observe light passage. A complete penetration is
recorded when any light passes through the witness plate. If no light is visible through
the witness plate, a partial penetration is recorded.
      5.3.5 Subsequent firings. If the first round fired yields a complete penetration, the
propellant charge for the second round shall be equal to that of the first round minus a
propellant decrement for a 50 or 100 ft/s (15 or 30 m/s) velocity decrease in order to
obtain a partial penetration. If the first round fired yields a partial penetration, the
propellant charge for the second round shall be equal to that of the first round plus a
propellant increment for a 50 ft/s (15 m/s) velocity increase in order to obtain a complete
penetration. A propellant increment or decrement, as applicable, for at least 50 ft/s (15
m/s) shall be used until one partial and one complete penetration is obtained. After
obtaining a partial and a complete penetration, the propellant increment or decrement for
50 ft/s (15 m/s) shall be used. Firing shall be continued until a V5oBL(P) is determined,
using a random pattern of impact sites, unless otherwise specified.
      5.4 Calculation of the V50 BL(P) ballistic limit. The V50 BL(P) shall be calculated by
taking the arithmetic mean of an equal number of the highest partial and the lowest
complete penetration impact velocities within the allowable velocity span as defined by
the contracting officer (see USATECOM TOP 2-2-710).
      5.5 Computation of striking velocity. Instrumentation velocities shall be corrected as
follows:
          VS = VI - VL
            Where:
            Vs = Striking velocity at the test sample
            Vi = Instrumentation velocity

Additional data may be required by a contracting activity. When testing is done at a
place other than a Government facility, results shall be reported on forms either furnished
or approved by the Government. One copy of each complete report shall be forwarded to
the agency designated by the Government.
      5.7 Acceptance and rejection. The selected armor samples shall meet the minimum
V5oBL(P) ballistic requirements specified in the order for the represented lot to be
acceptable. Failure of any test samples to meet the minimum specified V5oBL(P) ballistic
limit shall constitute rejection of the entire lot which they represent. Unless otherwise
specified, the ballistic tests shall be conducted and the test results accepted prior to
shipment of the lot of armor represented by the test samples.
      5.8 Test samples ownership. Ballistic test samples that comply with ballistic
requirements are considered as part of the lot of armor they represent, and ownership of
them passes to the Government upon acceptance. The Government inspector shall
dispose of these test samples unless instructed otherwise by the procuring activity. Test
samples that fail to comply with the ballistic requirements are considered as part of the lot
they represent and remain the property of the supplier just as does the rejected lot they
represent.
      5.9 Retests. Reference shall be made to the appropriate specification or applicable
test directive for guidance on the number of retest samples required, if such are allowed.
If the retest samples do not pass the ballistic test, the lot from which they came, or the
process by which they were made shall be permanently rejected. Otherwise, if all retest
samples pass, the lot or process shall be accepted.
      5.10 Security classification of armor. Terminal ballistics performance data on armor
materials shall be classified in accordance with ARL PROGRAM No. 0183009, "Security
Classification Guide for Armor Materials" dated 30 July 1993.
6. NOTES
(This section contains information of a general or explanatory nature that may be helpful,
but is not mandatory.)
       6.1 Intended use. This test method standard is military unique because it is
intended for use in ballistic acceptance testing of armor and for research and
development of new armor materials (see 1.2).

to the 2 grain RCC ("right circular cylinder") V5 o Ballistic Test, in a rigid frame and
backed by air. The V5 o number notes the velocity (in feet per second) at which the
probability of penetration of the fabric by the projectile is 50 percent. In this table, the
symbol " I" denotes a fabric that has a different blend for its technical face and technical
back. In this table, the symbol "I I" denotes a fabric that has two yarns of different
blends oriented such that the first yarn is exposed on the technical face and technical
back of the fabric and the second yarn is embedded in the fabric. The blend to the left of

        Dyeing and printing of the disclosed fabrics may be carried out in accordance
with standard methods, all of which are known to those of skill in the art. Any of the
fibers disclosed herein may be producer-colored in that color is imparted to the fibers
during the fiber formation process.
        Embodiments of the ballistic fabrics disclosed herein may be incorporated into a
variety of different garments in various ways. Such garments may include, but are not
limited to, shirts, pants, protective undergarments, gloves, knee and elbow pads,
jumpsuits, t-shirts, etc. The entirety of the garments may be formed from the inventive
fabrics, or alternatively such fabrics may be incorporated into the garments at strategic
locations. In one embodiment, the entirely of the garment is formed of the fabric (e.g.,
protective undergarments). In other embodiments, pockets or enclosures are provided
on the exterior or interior of the garment in strategic locations (e.g., the forearms, groin
area, femoral arteries, etc.).   The ballistic fabric is positioned within the pockets as
protective inserts to stop penetration of the ejecta through the garment.
        The ballistic fabrics may be provided as inserts that are removable and
replaceable in the pockets. Placement of the pockets on a garment may be customized
depending on the task of the wearer and not all pockets need be filled with protective
inserts. Furthermore, different types of protective inserts may be available. In this way,
the protection afforded the wearer by the garment may be customized and tailored to a
particular situation.
