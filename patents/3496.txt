ABSTRACT
A hardenable or settable material comprises a hydraulic binder and particles of solid salt, the
particles of solid salt containing NaCl and Na 2 CO 3 . The salt may also contain NaHCO3. The
material may be used to fill voids in mines or disposed of in regulated waste facilities. The
material has a high content of solid salt and a low content of binder. Water or brine (such as CSG
derived brine) is suitably added in an amount that does not result in dissolution of the salt.

TITLE
Hardenable or settable material and method for stabilising CSG salts
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]       The present invention relates to a geotechnical stabilising composition. The invention
could also be used in some waste disposal, construction and mining applications. The present
invention also relates to a method for treating brines, neutralising acid rock drainage, stabilising
or binding CSG salts in Registered Waste Facilities (RWF) and filling bore holes.
BACKGROUND ART
[0002]       Underground mining of coal may involve the use of longwall mining equipment to
remove coal. The longwall mining machine removes coal from a long face. The longwall mining
machine has its own hydraulic roof supports which advance with the machine as mining
progresses. Once the machine has excavated a cavity in the coal seam, it moves along the coal
seam, thereby extending the cavity, known as the goaf, which will collapse causing subsidence
of the surface. The process of developing a Long Wall mine requires the construction of drives
with roof support. This leaves voids in the mine.
[0003]       Underground coal mines may also use the room and pillar mining technique. In this
technique, a network of rooms is cut into the coal seams. Pillars of coal are left behind in order to
keep up the roof. In some coal mines, these pillars can constitute up to 40% of the total coal in
the coal seam. Once the seam has been exhausted, the pillars can be removed, which will
typically result in the roof collapsing. This is known as retreat mining. Retreat mining entails
significant risk as the collapse of the roof can be somewhat unpredictable.
[0004]       Large volumes of coal are also extracted using open cut mining. In open cut mining,
a pit of progressively increasing depth and width is formed to remove the overburden and then
the coal. When the pit reaches its maximum practical size, shafts or drives may be excavated into
the remaining coal in the walls at the bottom of the pit. This removes additional coal from the
coal seam. Additional shafts or drives may be cut to extract additional coal. Normally, there will
be pillars or walls of coal left between adjacent shafts or drives in order to provide support for
the roof and to minimise the risk of the roof collapsing and burying equipment. The pillars or
walls of coal represent sterilised resource.

[0005]       Hard-rock underground mining involves the excavation of shafts or drives and stopes
to remove ore. Meshes, roof panels and/or rock bolts, and cemented fill may be used to support
the roof in hard-rock underground mining. Once an ore body is exhausted, the shafts or drives
are simply left in place and the entrance to the mine is normally locked or collapsed to prevent
unauthorised access. Cemented stopes when in place act to stabilise the mining area.
[0006]       Extraction of natural gas from coal seams and shale rock is becoming a large
industry in several countries. For example, in Australia, extraction of coal seam gas (which is
also known as "coal bed methane" in some countries) is leading to the development of a large
natural gas industry. Extraction of coal seam gas normally involves drilling a well into the coal
seam. Water is pumped out of the coal seam which causes a reduction in pressure within the coal
seam. As a result of this reduction in pressure, the coal seam gas can also escape from the coal
seam via the well. In some instances, fracturing of the coal in the coal seam takes place to
increase the production of coal seam gas. This fracturing of the coal is often referred to as
"fracking".
[0007]       Production of coal seam gas results in large quantities, often millions of litres, of
water being removed from the coal seam and coming to the surface. This water is often quite
salty and can constitute a salty water having significant dissolved salt content. Sodium chloride
is often the predominant salt present in the salty water, but other salt species may also be present.
Other contaminants may also be contained in the salty water, such as organic species from the
coal seam and other chemicals that may have been injected into the coal seam to enhance
extraction of coal seam gas or to improve fracking of the coal seam.
[0008]       Disposal of salty water extracted during coal seam gas production can be
problematical. Indeed, in most states of Australia, coal seam gas salty water is considered to be a
regulated waste. One possible solution that has been proposed for disposing of this salty water
includes re-injecting the salty water back into the coal seam or deep underground. This has met
resistance from environmental groups because the salty water could escape from where it has
been placed and potentially contaminate underground aquifers. Another proposal to treat the
salty water involves passing the brine through a reverse osmosis plant to produce a clean stream
of water that can be used in agriculture or disposed of by pumping to natural waterways, and a
concentrated brine stream. The concentrated brine stream may be suitable for disposal at sea.
However, most coal seam gas extraction plants are located some distance from the sea, making
disposal of the concentrated brine in the sea impractical and environmentally unacceptable. If
other contaminants are present in the brine, disposal of the concentrated brine at sea may not be

allowed. A further possibility for disposal of the salty water involves passing the salty water to
ponds or dams and allowing the water in the pond or dams to evaporate to form salt. Again, the
location of many coal seam gas extraction plants makes this option impractical. This option
requires purchase of significant areas of land upon which to place the ponds or dams. Coal seam
gas plants are also often located in regions of good-quality farming land and there is resistance to
devoting farming land to salt formation ponds or dams for disposal of brines. Further, if the salty
water is contaminated with other contaminants, the salt that is produced may comprise a
contaminated salt that would be considered to be a regulated waste, thereby increasing the cost
of further disposal. Recently Regulators have rejected evaporation ponds as an acceptable
method of CSG water disposal.

SUMMARY OF INVENTION
[0010]       In a first aspect, the present invention provides a method for forming a hardenable or
settable material comprising (a) treating a water containing dissolved salts to produce solid salt
comprising a mixture containing NaCl and Na2CO3, and (b) forming a hardenable or settable
composition by mixing an hydraulic binder and optionally other additives, the solid salt
produced in step (a) and water in an amount to react with the hydraulic binder but not sufficient
to fully dissolve the solid salt to form a stabilised salt based material.
[0011]       In a second aspect, the present invention provides a hardenable or settable material
comprising a hydraulic binder and particles of solid salt, the particles of solid salt containing
NaCl and Na2CO3. In this aspect of the present invention, water may be added in an amount to
react with the hydraulic binder but not in excess to thereby avoid or minimise dissolution of the
solid salt.
[0012]       The hardenable or settable material of the present invention can be disposed of by
placement in a RWF. The hardenable or settable material may be used as a geotechnical
stabilisation agent and it may be used to fill or support voids in mines. The hardenable or settable
material of the present invention may also be used in some construction-related applications.
Thus, the present invention should not be considered to be limited to use solely in applications
relating to the stabilisation of geological features (whether naturally occurring or man-made).
Indeed, the present invention may be used as a substitute for concrete in many applications.

                                                    -r
[0013]        In a third aspect, the present invention provides a method for stabilising a void in an
underground mine or an open cut mine void, the method comprising (a) treating a water
containing dissolved salt to produce solid salt comprising a mixture of NaCl and Na2CO3, (b)
forming a hardenable or settable composition by mixing an hydraulic binder, the salt produced in
step (a) and water in an amount to react with the hydraulic binder but not sufficient to fully
dissolve the solid salt to form a geotechnical stabilisation agent, and (c) supplying the
geotechnical stabilisation agent to the void and allowing the geotechnical stabilisation agent to
set to form a hard mass to thereby stabilise the void.
[0014]       The solid salt used in the present invention contains NaCl and Na2CO3. In some
embodiments, the salt further comprises NaHCO3. It has been found that although using salt that
comprises a mixture of NaCl and Na2CO3 enables the hardenable or settable material (which
may also be referred to as a cementitious material) to harden and set, improved strength and
binding properties are obtained if NaHCO3 is also present in the salt mixture. In preferred
embodiments, the salt comprises a mixture of NaCl, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3.
[0015]       In other embodiments, the salt may further comprise one or more of KCl, K2CO3
KHCO3 and CaSO4. Other additives may also be used, such as setting accelerators,
waterproofing agents, fungicides and the like.
[0016]       In some embodiments, the salt may comprise a mixture comprising from 10 to 40%
Na2CO3 by weight of the total salt mixture, 30 to 90% NaCl by weight of the total salt mixture
and from 0 to 30% NaHCO3 by weight of the total salt mixture. In other embodiments, the salt
may comprise a mixture comprising from 15 to 35% Na2CO3 by weight of the total salt mixture,
40 to 85% NaCl by weight of the total salt mixture and from 5 to 25% NaHCO3 by weight of the
total salt mixture. In another embodiment, the salt may comprise a mixture comprising from 20
to 35% Na2CO3 by weight of the total salt mixture, 45 to 7 0% NaCl by weight of the total salt
mixture and from 10 to 25% NaHCO3 by weight of the total salt mixture. In a further
embodiment, the salt may comprise a mixture comprising about 30% Na2CO3 by weight of the
total salt mixture, about 50% NaCl by weight of the total salt mixture and about 20% NaHCO3
by weight of the total salt mixture. Specific ratios of NaCl: Na2CO3: NaHCO3 may include
85:15:5, or 70:20:10 or 50:30:20. Other specific ratios falling within the above stated ranges may
also be used.
[0017]       The salt mixture may also contain other salts. These other salts will normally be
present in lesser amounts and need not be described in detail. It will be understood that the exact
composition of the salt mixture will be dependent upon the dissolved salts present in the salty

water from which the solid salt mixture is recovered.
[0018]       Water is added to the hardenable or settable material to cause the hydraulic binder to
set. Water is desirably added in an amount such that the hydraulic binder can fully set by
reacting with the water. However, use of an excess of water (that is, in excess of that required to
react with the hydraulic binder) should be avoided in order to avoid complete or even partial
dissolution of the solid salt. In some embodiments, water is added in an amount such that
dissolution of the salt is minimized. The hardenable or settable material may have water present
in step (b). The water may be added during batching of the hydraulic binder and the solid salt.
Alternatively, the hydraulic binder and solid salt may be batched together and transported as an
essentially dry mixture to a site where the dry components are subsequently mixed with water. In
another embodiment, the solid salt is formed and transported to a remote site for mixing with the
hydraulic binder. Water may be added at that site or water may be added at a different site.
[0019]       The water may comprise fresh water. In other embodiments, the water is added as
part of a brine solution. The brine solution may comprise a concentrated brine. The brine
solution may comprise from 20% dissolved salt(s) up to the saturated concentration of dissolved
salt(s). The concentrated brine may be formed as part of the process for forming the solid salt.
For example, if a reverse osmosis process is used as part of the process to form the solid salt, a
concentrated brine will be produced as a product of the reverse osmosis process. Some of that
concentrated brine may be used to form the solid salt and some of the concentrated brine may be
used by adding it in liquid form to the hardenable or settable component.
[0020]       The brine may contain dissolved NaCl and dissolved Na2CO3. The brine may also
contain dissolved NaHCO3. It has been surprisingly found that a brine, especially a concentrated
brine, containing dissolved NaCl and dissolved Na2CO3 allows for the mixture to set hard. If
brine is used instead of water, additional brine may be added (when compared to using fresh
water) to the mixture without causing excessive dissolution of the solid salt, it being appreciated
that as a brine solution is being used, it has less capacity to dissolve the solid salts as the brine
already contains dissolved salt. This may have benefits in that adding more liquid to the dry
components may allow for greater workability of the wet mixture prior to setting. The brine may
comprise dissolved NaCl and dissolved Na2CO3 and optionally NaHCO3 present in an amount
of from 20% by weight of the brine up the solubility limit of those salts in water (calculated from
the total weight of the dissolved salt components).

[0021]        In some embodiments, the hardenable or settable material may further comprise
particles of aggregate. The particles of aggregate that may be added to the cementitious material
or the geotechnical stabilising agent may comprise any particulate material that is suitable for
use as an aggregate in concrete. In embodiments where the cementitious material or the
geotechnical stabilising agent is used to stabilise a void in a mine, the aggregate will preferably
comprise mine rejects, such as overburden, tailings, and excavated rock. The aggregate may also
comprise waste streams from power stations, such as fly ash, or waste streams from the
aluminium industry, such as spent pot lining and anode butts. The aggregate material may also
comprise sand, gravel, particles of glass (such as waste glass or discard glass), a clay material
(such as bentonite) or indeed any other aggregate suitable for use with cementitious binders, and
mixtures thereof.
[0022]        In a fourth aspect, the present invention provides a geotechnical stabilisation agent
comprising solid salt comprising a mixture of NaCl and Na2CO3, and an hydraulic binder.
[0023]        The solid salt may also include NaHCO3.Water is added to the geotechnical
stabilisation agent. The water facilitates setting of the hydraulic binder so that the geotechnical
stabilisation agent can form a solid mass.
[0024]        In desirable embodiments of the present invention, the solidified product is formed of
a matrix comprising particles of the solid salt and the set hydraulic binder. Effectively, the
hydraulic binder acts to bind together the particles of solid salt. As the particles of solid salt are
not fully dissolved, the particles of solid salt in the set product may effectively act as an
aggregate in the set product.
[0025]        In one embodiment, the hardenable or settable material comprises a mixture of from
50 to 99% solid salt and from 1 to 50% hydraulic binder, by weight, calculated on a dry basis.
[0026]        In some embodiments, the hardenable or settable material comprises from 60 to 99%
solid salt, preferably from 70 to 98% solid salt, more preferably from 80 to 98% solid salt, even
more preferably from 88 to 98% solid salt, yet more preferably from 90 to 98% solid salt, or
even about 95% solid salt, calculated on the basis and calculated as a percentage of the total
amount of dry ingredients.
[0027]        In some embodiments, the hardenable or settable material comprises from 1%to
40% hydraulic binder, preferably from 2 to 30% hydraulic binder, more preferably from 2 to
20% hydraulic binder, even more preferably from 2 to 12% hydraulic binder, yet more
preferably from 2 to 10% hydraulic binder, or even about 5% hydraulic binder, calculated on the

basis and calculated as a percentage of the total amount of dry ingredients.
[0028]       The amount of water that is added to the hardenable or settable material preferably
comprises from 10% to 40% by weight, calculated as weight percent of the total weight of dry
solids, more preferably from 15 to 35%, even more preferably from 20 to 33 %, yet more
preferably from 23 to 30%, yet even more preferably from 25 to 30%.
[0029]       In some embodiments, the amount of water that is added is the minimum amount of
water required to react with the hydraulic binder. In this embodiment, dissolution of one or more
of the salts present in the salt is largely avoided, preferably completely avoided. In this manner,
any deleterious effects arising from dissolution of one or more of the salt compounds on the final
cementitious product is avoided.
[0030]       Without wishing to be bound by theory, the present inventors have postulated that
using an amount of water that is sufficient to allow the hydraulic binder to set but is not
sufficient to also dissolve all of the solid salt means that particles of solid salt will remain in the
set material. These particles of solid salt effectively act as an aggregate in the set material,
thereby forming a solid mass having reasonable to good strength properties. The present
inventors have also postulated that adding too little water will result in the hardenable or settable
material being difficult to handle and setting too quickly whilst adding too much water will result
in dissolution of too much of the particles of solid salt.
[0031]       In some embodiments of the present invention, the salt is formed from a water
containing dissolved salt. The water containing dissolved salt may comprise a water containing
dissolved salt extracted during coal seam gas extraction or during extraction of gas or oil from
shale. In other embodiments, the water containing dissolved salt may comprise water extracted
during fracking operations. Other waters containing dissolved salt may also be used. The water
containing dissolved salt may also comprise a water containing dissolved salt extracted from an
underground aquifer. The water containing dissolved salt may contain appreciable quantities of
dissolved salt.
[0032]       In one embodiment, the water containing dissolved salt is treated using a reverse
osmosis process as part of a process to form a solid salt and water. One example of suitable
technology in this regard is available from Carina Water Resources LLC, based in West
Virginia, USA. The process to produce solid salt involves 4 steps, being: 1/ cyclones, to remove
solids, 2/ decomposing to remove bacteria and organics, 3/ pressure filtration to produce
agriculture quality water and wet, coarse salt, which goes to 4/ reverse osmosis, with self-

cleaning membranes, which produces a concentrated brine that leads finally, possibly after
further evaporation processes and crystallisation, to a solid salt ( a mixture of various salts and
contaminants) and potable water or water vapour.
[0033]       In other embodiments, the solid salt may be formed by placing the water containing
dissolved salt in a solar evaporation ponds or dam and evaporating water to form solid salt or
through a mechanical crystalliser.
[0034]       The hydraulic binder used in the present invention may comprise a cementitious
binder. Where a cementitious binder is used, the hardenable or settable material comprises a
cementitious material. The cementitious binder may comprise a Portland cement. Other
cementitious binders, such as energetically modified cement, Pozzolan-lime cements, slag-lime
cements, supersulfated cements, calcium aluminate cements, calcium sulfoaluminate cements,
and magnesia cements may also be used in the present invention.
[0035]       As mentioned above, in some embodiments, particles of an aggregate material may
be added to the cementitious material or the geotechnical stabilisation agent. The aggregate may
be added in an amount from 0% to 70% by weight, calculated as weight percent of the total
weight of dry solids. Preferably, the aggregate may be added in an amount of from 0 to 66%,
more preferably from 0 to 50%, even more preferably from 0 to 45%, or in other amounts within
that range.
[0036]       The aggregate may be sized such that the particle size distribution of the aggregate
falls within a predetermined range of particle sizes. The particle size may vary across a wide
range. The aggregate may comprise flotation tailings, such as flotation tailings obtained from
washing of coal. In other embodiments, the aggregate may comprise mine reject or tailings
solids. Preferably, the aggregate is used in an "as-available" condition, without using milling or
grinding to alter the particle size. The economic considerations for avoiding milling or grinding
of the aggregate are apparent. In some embodiments, the aggregate particles may be sized such
that they have a particle size of up to 50mm.
[0037]       The salt that is added to the hardenable or settable material may be predominantly
sodium chloride. Other salts, including sodium carbonate and (optionally) sodium bicarbonate
will also be present. The salt that is added may comprise a solid salt recovered from groundwater
extracted during coal seam gas extraction or extraction of gas from shale deposits or extraction
of natural gas from other geological features.

[0038]       In some embodiments of the present invention, the hardenable or settable material is
made by batching appropriate quantities of the solid ingredients. The solid salt may contain some
moisture and may or may not set. By forming the geotechnical stabilising agent by batching the
solid ingredients, the cementitious material or the geotechnical stabilising agent may be stored
for later use.
[0039]       In other embodiments, the hardenable or settable material is made by mixing the
ingredients into a slurry. In this embodiment, the slurry is suitably used shortly after being
formed. This enables the slurry, for example, to be pumped into a void in a mine or into a RWF
or into a borehole and subsequently allowed to set to form a solid, stable mass.
[0040]       In some embodiments, the hardenable or settable material having a relatively low
moisture content is placed into storage and subsequently retrieved from storage, mixed with
water to form a slurry and sent for final use.
[0041]       In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the solid salt is formed by
treating a water containing dissolved salt extracted from a coal seam gas well, with the water
containing dissolved salt being treated at or near the location of the coal seam gas well. The solid
salt may then be transported, such as by road or rail transport, to a mine located away from the
coal seam gas well and the salt may then be batched with the other ingredients to form the
geotechnical stabilising agent. The hardenable or settable material may then be used as a
geotechnical technical stabilising agent to stabilise a void in the mine. The geotechnical
stabilising agent may be mixed with water to form a slurry and the slurry may be pumped or
otherwise delivered into the void in the mine and allowed to set to form a solid mass that
stabilises the void.
[0042]       The hardenable or settable material of the present invention suitably comprises a
mixture of having a very high content of solid salt and a relatively low content of hydraulic
binder. The present inventors have discovered that such a mixture can set to form a hard mass
having strength properties that make it suitable for placing in voids in mines or as a stabilised
solid in RWFs.
[0043]       In some embodiments, the salt comprises a solid salt recovered from a water
containing dissolved salt extracted during coal seam gas extraction. Such salt will mainly
comprise NaCl, with some NaHCO3 and Na2CO3 also being present. Minor amounts of other
salt species and contaminants may also be present in the salt.
[0044]       In some embodiments, the hardened mass formed from the salt, hydraulic binder,

                                                  IU
water and optionally aggregate has a compressive strength of at least 750kPa, more preferably
greater than IMpa, even more preferably 1.5Mpa or greater. The hardened mass may have a
strength of up to 5 Mpa, or a compressive strength of up to 4 Mpa, or a compressive strength of
up to 3Mpa.
[0045]      In another aspect, the water containing dissolved salt removed during coal seam gas
extraction may be used (either as a liquid or as a solid salt) to contact mine water having a low
pH to thereby increase the pH of the mine water. It will be appreciated that the coal seam gas
brine contains sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate which can be effective to increase the
pH of low pH water. This may be effective to neutralise the low pH water. Precipitation of one
or more dissolved metals in the low pH water may also take place.
[0046]      The present inventors have also found that a satisfactory hardenable or settable
material can be obtained by mixing a hydraulic binder with brine instead of water. The brine
suitably comprises a solution containing dissolved NaCl and Na2CO3 and optionally dissolved
NaHCO3. Therefore, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a hardenable or settable
material comprising a hydraulic binder mixed with a brine containing dissolved NaCl and
Na2CO3 and optionally dissolved NaHCO3. The hardenable or settable material in this aspect
preferably also includes aggregate.
[0047]      The brine suitably comprises a concentrated brine. In one embodiment, the brine
comprises a mixture of NaCl, Na2CO3 and optionally NaHCO3, with that mixture being
dissolved in water in an amount of from 20% by weight up to the solubility limit of the mixture
in water.
[0048]      The ratios of NaCl, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 present in the brine may comprise from
10 to 40% Na2CO3 by weight of the total weight of NaCl, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3, 30 to 90%
NaCl by weight of the total weight of NaCl, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3, and from 0 to 30%
NaHCO3 by weight of the total weight of NaCl, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3. In other embodiments,
the salt may comprise a mixture comprising from 15 to 35% Na2CO3 by weight of the total
weight of NaCl, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3, 40 to 85% NaCl by weight of the total weight of NaCl,
Na2CO3 and NaHCO3and from 5 to 25% NaHCO3 by weight of the total weight of NaCl,
Na2CO3 and NaHCO3. In another embodiment, the brine may comprise a dissolved salt mixture
comprising from 20 to 35% Na2CO3 by weight of the total weight of NaCl, Na2CO3 and
NaHCO3, 45 to 70% NaCl by weight of the total weight of NaCl, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3and
from 10 to 25% NaHCO3 by weight of the total weight of NaCl, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3. In a
further embodiment, the brine may comprise a mixture comprising about 30% Na2CO3 by

                                                    I I
weight of the total weight of NaCl, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3, about 50% NaCl by weight of the
total weight of NaCl, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3and about 20% NaHCO3 by weight of the total
weight of NaCl, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3. Specific ratios of NaCl: Na2CO3: NaHCO3 may
include 85:15:5, or 70:20:10 or 50:30:20. Other specific ratios falling within the above stated
ranges may also be used. The amount of brine added in this aspect of the present invention may
range from 15% to 60% by weight based on the total weight of solids, or from 17% to 50% by
weight based on the total weight of solids, with amounts of 17%, 20%, 30%, 40 % and 50%
providing a satisfactory product. In preferred embodiments, the present invention provides a
hardenable or settable material in the form of a cementitious material or a geotechnical
stabilising agent that can be used to stabilise voids in a mine. In some embodiments, the present
invention can be used to treat water containing dissolved salt, such as water containing dissolved
salt brought to the surface during extraction of coal seam gas. These types of water containing
dissolved salt are frequently classified as a regulated waste, which entails expensive disposal
processes. The present invention treats the water containing dissolved salt to form a clean water
stream and a solid salt which can then be used in the geotechnical stabilising agent that can be
used to stabilise voids in mines. When the cementitious material or the geotechnical stabilising
agent has set to a solid mass, the salt is effectively encased in a solid matrix, thereby effecting
safe disposal of the salt and benefitting the mine. Preliminary studies by the present inventors
have revealed that the coal seam gas industry in the state of Queensland, Australia, could
potentially produce 1,000,000 tonnes of salt each year and this salt could be effectively disposed
of by forming a cementitious material or a geotechnical stabilising agent in accordance with the
present invention and using that geotechnical stabilising agent to stabilise or fill voids in mines,
such as hard rock mines or coal mines. Embodiments of the present invention can take a brine
that is classified as a regulated waste and treat that brine to form a useful product.
[0049]        In preferred embodiments of the present invention, hardenable or settable material or
the cementitious material or the geotechnical stabilising agent is mixed with water to produce a
slurry which can set to form a solid mass. The slurry suitably can be pumped so they can be
easily delivered into a void. The slurry suitably has a low beach angle (such as 2 to 50) to
facilitate flow into inaccessible areas. The slurry is suitably a non-settling slurry or an slowly
settling slurry to minimise risk of pipe blockage during pumping. If any additional additives are
included in the slurry, they will ideally not be harmful to the environment. The slurry suitably

stabilisation agent contains significant quantities of solid salt, the salt may be susceptible to
dissolution if it comes into contact with a large head of water or with running water. Therefore,
in some embodiments, it may be desirable to use the cementitious material or the geotechnical
stabilisation agent to fill voids in areas that are likely to remain dry. If the geotechnical
stabilisation agent is to be used in filling voids in regions that may be exposed to water having a
high head of pressure, or to running water, it may be desirable to encase the geotechnical
stabilisation agent in a water resistant coating, such as a polymeric coating, resin or a concrete
coating or a bituminous coating. In one embodiment, the geotechnical stabilisation agent may be
shotcreted to cover exposed surfaces in concrete, seal voids or coat the cemented salt.
[0051]       In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for forming a hardenable
mass comprising (a) treating a water containing dissolved salt to produce solid salt comprising a
mixture of NaCl and Na2CO3, and (b) forming a cementitious composition by mixing an
hydraulic binder, the solid salt produced in step (a) and water in an amount to react with the
hydraulic binder but not sufficient to fully dissolve the solid salt to form a hardened mass and
allowing the hardenable mass to set.
[0052]       The salt mixture may further include NaHCO3.
[0053]       In some embodiments, the invention may be used to stabilise salt in regulated waste
facilities (RWFs).
[0054]       The quantities and relative amounts of each component added to the hardenable or
settable material may be as described with reference to the quantities and relative amounts of
those components present in the cementitious material or the geotechnical stabilising agent, as
described hereinabove.
[0055]       Any of the features described herein can be combined in any combination with any
one or more of the other features described herein within the scope of the invention.

Examples:
[0057]       The following samples were made and some were subjected to testing. In the
following examples, unless otherwise specified, the salt comprised a mixture of NaCl, Na2CO3

and NaHCO3. The ratio of each component was selected so that the final salt mixture reflected a
typical salt mixture derived from salty water obtained from a coal gas seam extraction process,
typically comprising 50% NaCl, 30% Na2CO3 and 20% NaHCO3, calculated as a weight
percentage calculated on the total weight of the salt mixture. Where other salt mixtures were
used, these are noted:

[0058]       The samples produced in examples 1 and 5 were tested for compressive strength.
Example 1 exhibited a compressive strength of 1.5Mpa and example 5 exhibited a compressive
strength of 3.0Mpa. It is noted that geotechnical stabilisation agents having a compressive
strength of above 750kPa are generally considered to be suitable for filling voids in some mining
operations.
[0059]       Some of the examples were failures. The reasons that those examples failed to
properly set include insufficient cement added to the mixture, insufficient water added to the
mixture, too much water added to the mixture, or improper or insufficient mixing of the
components (experimental techniques were refined as the project developed).
[0060]       Examples 39, 40, 42 43, 44 and 45 used a concentrated brine in place of water. The
concentrated brine essentially comprised a mixture of NaCl, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 in a ratio of
70:20:10. This mixture was dissolved in water to its solubility limit in order to form the
concentrated brine. Example 39, 40, 43 and 44 included solid salt. Examples 42 and 45 had no
solid salt present. In each instance, a satisfactory set material was obtained. In examples 40 and
42, 30% brine was added. In example 43, 40% brine was added. In example 44, 50% brine was
added. This produced a set product that was estimated to have compression strength of 3MPa
(example 42), 2MPa (example 43) and IMPa (example 44). The set product formed using
concentrated brine instead of water appears to have a higher early set strength then the set
product that is formed using water. Advantageously, using brine instead of water also allows
extra liquid to be added (when compared to using water) without detrimentally affecting
compressive strength. This has benefit in that the wet mixture becomes easier to work and pump.
[0061]       Examples 42 and 45 used a mixture that comprised cement, concentrated brine and
aggregate (sand). Again, the concentrated brine essentially comprised a mixture of NaCl,
Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 in a ratio of 70:20:10. This mixture was dissolved in water to its
solubility limit in order to form the concentrated brine. No solid salt was present in these
examples. A satisfactory set product was obtained.
[0062]       The present inventors have discovered that a hardenable material may be formed by
mixing in hydraulic binders (such as a cement) with a salt mixture that includes NaCl and
Na2CO3. Na2CO3, is commonly found mixed with ordinary salt (NaCl) that is recovered from
treating coal seam gas water (and other salty waters). Thus, embodiments of the present
invention provides a method for treating coal seam gas water to recover a salt mixture therefrom,
which salt mixture comprises NaCl and Na2CO3. The salt mixture will also typically contain
NaHCO3 and it has been found that a stronger material having better binding properties is

obtained when the salt mixture present in the geotechnical stabilising agent or hardenable
material comprises a mixture of NaCl, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3.
