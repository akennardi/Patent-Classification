                        CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
   [0001]       This application claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application No. 61/676,156, filed
   July 26, 2012 and U.S. Patent Application No. 61/809,091, filed April 5, 2013, the contents of
 5 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
                                                  FIELD
   [0002]       Embodiments disclosed herein generally relate to a support grid for use in a vessel
   containing a media bed, which may include a filtering surface supporting the media bed and be
   supported by an inner surface of the vessel.
 0                                           BACKGROUND
   [0003]       In some petrochemical and general industry applications, internal screens are needed
   in process pressure vessels for the purposes of filtering and supporting filter media. For some of
   these applications, however, the process induces large loads on the internal screen surfaces and
   generates extreme swings in temperature ranges that cause thermal expansion.        Traditional flat
 5 surface grid assemblies may be located near the tangent line of the head to shell weld. With
   such designs, the entire volume of the head may be a dead area, with no reaction or drying
   adsorption occurring. Further, the typical flat grid's design may require support beams to carry
   the weight of the bed and the process pressure differential.
   [0004]       With respect to the utilization of a media bed in the vessel, in some traditional
 0 installations, during down flow in a vessel a central outlet may be used and may cause flow to
   move sideways as it reaches lower elevations of the bed. Flow rates can vary within only a
   single level of the bed, causing poorly utilized catalyst and potential early breakthrough of the
   sieve. In an up flow case, an outlet basket covering the nozzle may create poor distributed flow.
   The implications for bed regeneration can be quite severe, and may have the potential for early
25 breakthrough and effective loss of bed height.
   [0005]       In designing vessels, it is often desirable to provide the end user with a maximum
   vessel volume, to effectively resist the expected process loads, and to provide a good
   distribution pattern for flows moving through the vessel.

                                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0034]      The following detailed description of embodiments refers to the accompanying
   drawings, which illustrate specific embodiments.            Other embodiments having different
 0 structures and operation do not depart from the scope of the present disclosure.
   [0035]      Embodiments disclosed herein include a support grid assembly that may be used
   within tanks or vessels to support media beds through which fluids are directed. Such media
   beds may be used in a variety of processes, including but not limited to catalytic, molecular
   sieves, alumina drying, resin ion exchange, carbon filtering, etc. Various fluids, including but
 5 not limited to liquid, gas, oil, water, etc., may be processed through the vessel. The vessel may
   be oriented vertically, horizontally, or in other orientations and configurations known in the art.
   The vessel may generally comprise a body and head portions coupled at opposite ends of the
   body to form a sealed interior vessel volume. The support grid assembly may be disposed along
   and utilize the inner surface of the vessel head for structural support, as well as to maximize the
20 interior vessel volume for use by additional media and other interior components.
   [0036]      The support grid assembly may include a plurality of panels having a filtering surface
   formed by one or more screens on the top, side, bottom, or other exposed surface of the panels,
   and a manifold coupled to the panels.         The panels may be, in some embodiments, radially
   disposed about the manifold. The screens may support a media bed, and in certain modes such a
25 down flow, fluid may flow through the media bed and the screens into the panels. Fluid may
   then flow into the manifold and out of the vessel. Fluid may also flow directly into the manifold
   through a screen or perforated plate portion that forms a top of the manifold. Alternatively, the
   direction of flow may be reversed, such as in certain modes of up flow, and flow into the
   manifold may be distributed to the panels, with flow then passing out of the panels, through the
                                                   6

                                                                           JAWS ref: 300800AUDIV/88
   screens, and into the vessel.    Flow through the assembly in either an up flow or down flow
   condition can be compressible (gas) or incompressible (liquid).
   [0037]      Certain terminology is used herein for convenience only and is not to be taken as a
   limitation on the embodiments described. For example, words such as "top", "bottom", "upper,"
 5 "lower," "left," "right," "horizontal," "vertical," "upward," and "downward" merely describe the
   configuration shown in the figures. Indeed, the referenced components may be oriented in any
   direction and the terminology, therefore, should be understood as encompassing such variations
   unless specified otherwise. Throughout this disclosure, where a process or method is shown or
   described, the method may be performed in any order or simultaneously, unless it is clear from
 0 the context that the method depends on certain actions being performed first.
   [0038]      Referring to the drawings, where like reference numerals refer to the same or similar
   parts, FIG. 1 shows a support grid assembly 40 in a vessel 42 according to one embodiment.
   The support grid assembly 40 may be concentrically disposed in a lower vessel head 44 of the
   cylindrical vessel 42. The vessel 42 may also include, for example, a vessel body 46, interior
 5 vessel components (not shown), the opposite vessel head 48, an inlet 52, and an outlet 54. A
   fluid surface 56 is shown with flow "F", which in certain modes of operation could be in the
   opposite direction. Filter media is not shown. One example of a vessel that can be used with the
   embodiments described herein is illustrated in FIG. 4 of U.S. Patent No. 5,015,383, the contents
   of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.
 0 [0039]      The support grid assembly 40 includes one or more grid panels 60 coupled to a center
   manifold 62. FIG. 1 illustrates eight panels 60, although any number of panels may be used,
   with the panels 60 radially disposed around the manifold 62. The panels 60 may be coupled to
   the manifold 62 using a pipe-based interface with flange or socket type connections that form a
   seal between the panels 60 and the manifold 62.         Other types of interfaces and connections
25 known in the art may be used with the embodiments described herein.
   [0040]      The panels 60 may rest against the inner wall of the vessel head 44 for structural
   support. The panels 60 may be formed from walls with, for example, a first wall that includes
   one or more sections of screens 64, 66 that are supported by one or more other walls 68, 70, 72.
   The walls 68, 70, 72 are secured together to form a sealed enclosure, which may be considered
30 to be, for example, a housing. The bottom surface of the panel 60 (or second wall 70) may be
   supported by and curved to conform to or approximately match the curvature of the curved inner
                                                  7

                                                                           JAWS ref: 300800AUDIV/88
   surface of the wall of the vessel head 44. At least a portion of the first wall, such as screen 66,
   may slope downward toward the manifold 62. This may increase the volume in the vessel 42
   available for fluid. Any panel surface, including any walls 68, 70, 72, may include one or more
   screens.   In one embodiment, the bottom surface of one or more panels 60 (second wall 70)
 5 includes a screen. In another embodiment, all walls of one or more panels 60 include screens.
   [0041]      The panels 60 may also rest against a gasket or other intermediate compressible layer
   surface between the panels 60 and the vessel wall. This additional gasket or layer is intended to
   fill any gap and excessive spaces between the panel and the vessel wall or shell. Although the
   screens 64, 66 and walls 68, 70, 72 are illustrated as generally rectangular or trapezoidal in
 0 shape, other configurations, shapes, or number of screen sections may be used with the
   embodiments described herein. For example, the nose of the panel 60 may be curved and, in
   some embodiments, formed from pipe and the end of the panel may be formed from a small strip
   of material. Each panel 60 may include a support bar 80 for support or handling purposes. In
   the embodiment shown, each panel 60 is also connected to an adjacent panel 60 by a rigid
 5 connection 82, such as a plate and bolt connection, for support, handling, or load distribution
   purposes. Other types of spacing, shimming, or gap compensating methods known in the art can
   also be applied to the embodiments disclosed herein.
   [0042]      Media, such as catalyst, may be supported on the panels 60. In particular, the media
   may be disposed on the upper surfaces of the screens 64, 66. Fluid may flow through the media,
 o through the screens 64, 66 into the manifold 62, and out of the vessel 42. The screens 64, 66 are
   configured to permit fluid flow but prevent the media from flowing out of the vessel 42.
   [0043]      In one embodiment, the screens 64, 66 of the upper surface of the panels 60, the
   screens included in any other wall 68, 70, 72, or screens for any embodiment disclosed herein
   may include a plurality of spaced filter wires supported on support rods. In one embodiment,
25 such screens may include wire with a substantially triangular cross-section, and may include
   Vee-Wire@ type screens (VEE-WIRE is a registered trademark of Bilfinger Water Technologies
   Inc.) or wedge wire type screens. In one embodiment, such screens may include plates having
   perforations, slots, and/or other filter-type openings. In one embodiment, the wires and plate
   openings may be oriented symmetrically, asymmetrically, horizontally, vertically, tangentially,
30 and combinations thereof relative to the longitudinal axis of the panel 60. In one embodiment,
   the spacing and sizes of wires and plate openings vary along the lengths of such screens. In one
   embodiment, such screens may include one or any combination of filter wires, plates, features
                                                 8

                                                                            JAWS ref: 300800AUDIV/88
   with perforations, features that otherwise provide a plurality of filter-type openings, and flow
   control vanes. Such screens may include the embodiments like those disclosed in U.S. Patent
   No. 6,663,774, filed on October 16, 2001 and specifically with respect to the filter wires 28 and
   the support rods 20 described therein, and embodiments like those disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
 5 7,425,264, filed on July 18, 2005 and specifically with respect to the wires 16 and the support
   rods 17 described therein, the contents of both of which patents are herein incorporated by
   reference in their entirety.
   [0044]      The manifold 62 may include a top screen 90 at the upper end of the manifold 62,
   and the top screen 90 may include the same features as the screens 64, 66 described above.
 o Media may be supported on the upper surface of the screen 90. Alternatively, the top screen 90
   could be a perforated plate or a member that has other openings that allow fluid through while
   supporting media. Fluid may flow through the media, through the openings in the top screen 90
   and past the top screen 90, and directly into the manifold 62. In one embodiment, the top screen
   90 may include a screen portion disposed above a perforated plate portion, with one or more
 5 flow control vanes disposed between the screen and plate portions. The manifold 62 may be
   coupled to an in hydraulic communication with an outlet 54 of the vessel 40. In other words, the
   interior volume defined by the panels 60 may be in hydraulic communication with the interior
   volume of the manifold 62, which may be in hydraulic communication with the vessel outlet 54.
   [0045]      FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate the interior of the manifold 62. The manifold 62 may include
 0 upper and lower flanges 92, 94 and a body 96 and one or more flow control vanes 98 disposed
   between the flanges 92, 94. The upper flange 92 may be used to support the top screen 90. The
   lower flange 94 may be used to couple the manifold 62 to the panels 60 via one or more tubular
   connections, such as pipes 100 as further described below, to place the panels 60 and manifold
   62 in hydraulic communication. The lower flange 94 may also be coupled to a manifold outlet
25 102, such as a flanged pipe, which couples the manifold 62 to the vessel head 44 and which is in
   fluid communication with the vessel outlet 54 (illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5B). One or more
   flow control vanes 104 may be supported by the top screen 90, and in particular may be coupled
   to the bottom surface of the top screen 90. The flow control vanes 104 may be disposed radially
   within the manifold 62, and may extend at least partially into the manifold outlet 102.         In
30 addition to or in place of flow control vanes, other flow control mechanisms may be provided as
   known to one of ordinary skill in the art for directional or flow characteristic management, or in
                                                  9

                                                                            JAWS ref: 300800AUDIV/88
   general to divert or restrict flow, of the fluid.   Examples of other flow control mechanisms
   include tubes, perforated plates, and cones.
   [0046]       FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate sectional views of the support grid assembly 40. The
   flanged portion of the manifold outlet 102 is shown bolted to the lower flange 94 of the manifold
 5 62.    The manifold outlet 102 may be welded to the vessel 44, such that it is in fluid
   communication with the vessel outlet 54. An extension pipe 106 may also be used to form the
   connection between the manifold 62 and the vessel outlet 54. The extension pipe 106 is shown
   disposed at least partially in the manifold outlet 102 and extending into the vessel outlet 54. In
   one embodiment, the extension pipe 106 (or another pipe portion coupled to the extension pipe
 0 106) may extend through and radially outward below the vessel outlet 54 such that a flanged
   section of the extension pipe 106 is used to connect the entire vessel assembly to any other
   structural type of outlet/inlet connection. Bolting, welding, clamping, and other similar types of
   structural or sealed connections known in the art may be used with the embodiments described
   herein.
 5 [0047]       The lower flange 94 of the manifold 62 is shown coupled to pipes 100 to establish
   fluid communication with each of the panels 60 through a bottom surface of the manifold 62.
   Each pipe 100 may be supported by an end portion of each panel 60, by, for example, being
   welded to the end portion, such as wall 72 to couple the panel 60 the manifold 62. Each pipe
   100 may include a pipe flange 108 or other similar type of shoulder portion, which is secured
 0 between the lower flange 94 and a split ring 110 having two or more pieces brought together
   around the pipe 100 (also illustrated in FIGS. 6A and 6B). In particular, one or more bolts may
   extend through the lower flange 94, the pipe flange 108, and the split ring 110 to secure each
   panel 60 to the manifold 62. The end portions of the panels 60 may be disposed below the main
   portion of the manifold 62, and may be coupled to a bottom surface, such as the lower flange 94,
25 of the manifold 62. In one embodiment, a seal, such as a gasket, may be disposed between the
   lower flange 94 of the manifold 62 and the pipe flange 108 of each pipe 100. In this manner,
   each panel 60 may be easily connected to and removed from the manifold 62 using a simple,
   structurally rigid and sealed connection.     The tubular connections or pipes 100 may take a
   variety of forms as are known in the art. For example, the tubular connections could instead be
30 fittings, such as 90 degree, 180 degree, or other angle bends, or another type of duct connection.
   [0048]       Referring to FIG. 5B, one or more flow arrows "F" are illustrated to show the fluid
   flow paths through the support grid assembly 40. A fluid directed to the support grid assembly
                                                 10

                                                                           JAWS ref: 300800AUDIV/88
   40 may first flow through any media disposed on the screens 64, 66, 90. As stated above, the
   screens 64, 66, 90 may be configured to permit fluid flow but prevent the media from flowing
   through the screens 64, 66, 90. Fluid may flow through screens 64, 66 into the interior of the
   panels 60, and may be directed along the bottom wall 70 to the pipes 100. Screens can
 5 incorporate perforations or other restrictions to control the amount of fluid that passes through
   each surface relative to the other screen surfaces. The fluid may then flow in an upward
   direction into the manifold 62, for example, through the pipes 100 in a direction parallel to the
   longitudinal axis of the vessel 42 and manifold 62 and opposite the direction of flow into the
   vessel 42 and fluid flow out of the vessel outlet 54.      Fluid may also flow directly into the
 0 manifold 62 via the top screen 90. The fluid may finally flow out of the manifold outlet 102
   (and extension pipe 106) in a downward direction, parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vessel
   and manifold 62 and out through the vessel outlet 54 in the same direction of the general flow
   through vessel 42. The flow control vanes 98, 104 or other flow control mechanisms disposed
   in the manifold 62 may help direct the fluid flow and control the fluid flow distribution through
 5 the support grid assembly 40. Any number or arrangement of flow control vanes 98, 104 may
   be used to optimize fluid flow direction and distribution through the support grid assembly 40.
   Flow can also move in the reverse direction if required by the application process, in which case,
   for example, flow into the manifold 62 from an inlet (previously outlet 54) may be distributed to
   the panels 60 and flow through the screens 64, 66 in to the vessel 42.
 0 [0049]      FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate one panel 60 connected to the manifold 62. Each panel
   60 may be connected to the manifold 62 by a locking connection 112 disposed on the outer
   surface of the manifold outlet 102. In particular, the locking connection 112 may include one or
   more rods 114 welded by support members 116 to the manifold outlet 102.            Each panel 60
   includes one or more mating connections 118 or hangers (illustrated in FIG. 7) for engagement
25 with the locking connections 112. In particular, the mating connections 118 may include one or
   more support members 120 welded to the walls 68 of the panels 60 at the nose or end portion
   121, the support members 120 each having a channel and hook portion 122 for receiving the
   locking connections 112.      The support members 120 of the mating connections 118 may be
   substantially parallel to the support members 116 of the locking connections 112, which may be
30 substantially perpendicular to the rods 114. In this manner, the panels 60 may be easily secured
   to and removed from connection with the manifold 62. Other types of connections known in the
   art may be used with the embodiments described herein.
                                                11

                                                                           JAWS ref: 300800AUDIV/88
   [0050]      FIG. 7 illustrates the interior of one panel 60.    As illustrated, one or more flow
   control vanes 126 may also be disposed in each panel 60 to direct fluid flow and control fluid
   flow distribution through each panel 60 and into the manifold 62. The flow control vanes 126
   may be generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of each panel 60, but include tapered ends that
 5 direct fluid flow toward the pipes 100. Any number of flow control vanes 126 may be used to
   maximize fluid flow direction and distribution through the support grid assembly 40. Tabs or
   other restrictions can be added to the control vanes 126 to further control or manipulate the flow
   characteristics inside the panel 60. As noted with respect to the flow control vanes 104 of the
   manifold 62, other flow control mechanisms known in the art, such as tubes, perforated plates,
 o and cones, can also be applied to balance the flow distribution in the embodiments disclosed
   herein.
   [0051]      FIG. 8 illustrates another embodiment of a support grid assembly 140 having panels
   160. The assembly 140 is similar to the assembly 40 described above, but the panels 160 have
   end portions 161 that direct fluid flow down into a manifold 162 via pipes 164 disposed below
 5 the panels 160. The pipes 164 may be connected to an upper flange 166 of the manifold 162
   through a top surface of the manifold 162.       An outlet pipe 168 may also be coupled to the
   manifold 168 for fluid flow out of the vessel assembly. An interior pipe 170 may be disposed
   through the manifold 162 and may be in fluid communication with the interior of the vessel
   assembly. Such a connection may be used, for example, where there are small or concentric
 0 outlets. The interior pipe 170 may be covered with a screen, similar to top screen 90, and may
   be utilized for backwashing processes to clean out used media, or to meet other similar process
   requirements, from the vessel assembly. The embodiments of the support grid assembly 40 of
   FIGS. 2-7, including the panels 60, may be used with the embodiments of the support grid
   assembly 140 of FIG. 8, and vice versa.
25 [0052]      FIG. 9 shows an embodiment of a panel 180 defining a volume having one or more
   flow control vanes 126. The panel 180 is similar to the panels 60 described above, but includes
   an end portion 182 that may be coupled directly to the body of the manifold 62, for example, at a
   side surface of the manifold 62, or to the manifold outlet 102. In this embodiment, the opening
   of the end portion 182 is square, but other shapes may be used. The number of flow control
30 vanes 126, which may also function as supports, may be varied depending on the load that will
   be experienced or desired flow characteristics and direction.      A load that is expected to be
   relatively heavy may result in more flow control vanes 126 or supports being placed in the panel
                                                 12

                                                                             JAWS ref: 300800AUDIV/88
   180. The number of flow control vanes 126 may decrease for smaller loads. The embodiments
   of the panel 180 illustrated in FIG. 9 may be used with the embodiments of the support grid
   assemblies 40, 140 described above, and vice versa. One or more combinations of the various
   panel 60, 160, 180 connections, including the pipes 100 and end portions 161, 182, may be used
 5 with the embodiments described herein.
   [0053]      In one method of installing the support grid assembly 40, the manifold outlet 102,
   which may be considered a center outlet sleeve, may first be attached to the vessel outlet 54
   (sometimes referred to as a nozzle). The manifold outlet 102 may be welded directly to the top
   forged area of the nozzle, or welded inside the nozzle diameter with some depth of insertion. An
 0 alternative not requiring welding to the nozzle is to use a trapped flange at the first exterior joint
   to the vessel. A jig may be provided for proper extension of the center hub into the vessel.
   Mating connections 118 or hangers are provided to position the nose section of each panel 60
   and will assist in the final sealing operation. After all pieces are placed inside the vessel and
   seated, a gasket (not shown) may be used on each pipe flange 108. The lower flange 94 may
 5 then be placed over the pipes 100 and bolted to the pipe flanges 108. The lower flange 94 may
   be sectioned to be able to pass through a manway, and then can be assembled and bolted in
   place. A gasket may be placed on the upper flange 92 and is ready for a final cover such as a top
   screen 90. The top screen 90 may then be seated over the gasket and bolted into place. The top
   screen 90 may have a flow control surface to match the performance of the panels 60.              The
 0 panels may be checked for full bearing directly on the lower vessel head 44 and shimmed, if
   necessary. Connections for tie bolts may be slotted to allow for thermal expansion and connect
   all the panels 60 into one assembly so no panel 60 can lift relative to the others.
   [0054]      FIGS. 10-14 show another embodiment of a support grid assembly 200. This support
   grid assembly 200, like the previous embodiments, may include one or more grid panels 210
25 coupled to a center manifold 212.      The manifold 212 may include a manifold base 214, a
   manifold grid connection piece 216 or body, and a manifold top plate 218. The manifold 212
   may be coupled to an outlet pipe 220 using a screen and pipe closure bolting ring 222. In this
   embodiment the outlet pipe 220 extends upward from the manifold 212, bends at 90 degrees,
   and extends through an opening 222 in the side of the vessel 42. Outside of the vessel 42, one
30 way to connect the outlet pipe 220 to an adjacent pipe may be with a sandwich flange 224 and a
   spiral wound gasket 226.
                                                13

                                                                            JAWS ref: 300800AUDIV/88
   [0055]      In some embodiments and as shown in the support grid assembly 200 of FIGS. 10
   14, a connection interface may be provided that allows expansion and contraction of
   components of the assembly and may permit angular deflection between components.              In the
   embodiment shown, such a connection interface is a bellows and facilitates installation of the
 5 support grid assembly 200. A bellows element 230 may be provided in, or in line with, the
   outlet pipe 220, in this case oriented vertically in a vertical portion of pipe 231, to be
   hydraulically interposed between the manifold outlet and the outlet pipe 220. Bellows elements
   232 may also be provided at the connection of each panel 210 to the manifold grid connection
   piece 216, also oriented vertically, in tubular connections or pipes 234. The bellows elements
 0 230, 232 serve at least two functions. First, the manifold 212 may not be perfectly installed,
   either as the result of variability in manufacturing, or because of its mounting in the vessel head
   44.   This variability may cause the location, angle, or both of the manifold 212 to be out of
   position from ideal. The outlet pipe 220 has a fixed position to reach and connect to outside the
   vessel 42, and where connections are made with flanges there is little tolerance for varied
 5 positioning. The bellows elements 230, 232 provide the ability of horizontal and vertical motion
   travel, as well as angular adjustment, to address variability of configuration of the components.
   Second, the bellows elements 230, 232 address thermal cycling and the accompanying
   expansion and contraction of parts. Temperature changes, which may be frequent and extreme
   depending on the process, may cause fatigue or weakening of the parts, and loosening of
 0 connections, among other things. The bellows elements 230, 232 or alternatively, joints selected
   by one of ordinary skill in the art, may account for expansion and contraction of the other parts.
   Examples of other such joints may include telescoping parts with gaskets and flexible tubing or
   hose.
   [0056]      In this embodiment of a support grid assembly 200, the tubular connections or pipes
25 234 may be configured such that fluid flows through the pipes 234 in the same direction as fluid
   flows through the manifold outlet; flow may be directed upward through the manifold 212.
   Again, the tubular connections or pipes 234 may also include or instead be fittings such as bends
   or other types of duct connections. Flow may be in either direction, from the vessel 42 into the
   panels 210, into the manifold 212 to the outlet pipe 220, or into the manifold 212 from an inlet
30 pipe (the same as outlet pipe 220), distributed to the panels 210, and into the vessel 42.
   [0057]      The material of the components of the support grid assemblies 40, 200 disclosed
   herein may be selected as appropriate for the process application.         In one embodiment the
                                                 14

                                                                            JAWS ref: 300800AUDIV/88
   material may be AISI 304 stainless steel. Bellows elements 230, 232 may be selected based on
   the process application, and one example of a supplier of bellows that may be appropriate is U.S.
   Bellows, Inc.
   [0058]      The support grid assembly 200 may be supported by a layer of compressible
 5 material, such as an insulation blanket 236 (FIGS. 10 and 11). The insulation blanket 236 may
   be provided between the support grid assembly 200 and the floor of the vessel head 44, and may
   fill the void or gaps that may exist between these features. In this embodiment, the insulation
   blanket 236 is shaped to approximate or be slightly larger than the footprint of the panels 210.
   Appropriate materials may include elastic materials, such as elastomers, or thermal gaskets, like
 0 texturized fiberglass yarn such as Tetraglas@ (TETRAGLAS is a registered trademark of Darca
   Southern, Inc.). The material may be selected based on characteristics that permit the filling of
   voids between the panels 210 and the vessel head 44 floor, while providing support for the
   panels 210, as, for example, some resilient materials might provide. In addition, the material
   should be selected as appropriate for the process application the material will be exposed to,
 5 such as harsh chemicals, fuels, or extreme heat. In one embodiment the insulation blanket 236 is
   1-inch thick Tetraglas@.
   [0059]       Support bars 240 may be provided. The support bars 240 may have one function of
   serving as a handle or lifting point for each panel 210.          The support bars 240 of this
   embodiment, however, may also provide a connection point for tying the panels 210 together.
 o The support bars 240 are attached at each end to a side of a panel 210, which may be done by
   welding or otherwise. As shown in FIG. 13, and in more detail in FIG. 14, each of the vertical
   portions at the ends of the support bars 240 has a swing arm 242 attached to it. At one end, the
   swing arms 242 have a sleeve 244 that goes around the support bar 240 and permits the arm 242
   to pivot. At the other end the swing arm 242 is free. The swing arm 242 of one panel 210 is
25 pivoted to meet the swing arm 242 of the adjacent panel 210, and the arms 242 are bolted to
   together as may be seen in FIG. 14.       This may be repeated around the entire support grid
   assembly 200 to connect all of the panels 210 to each other.         This may eliminate the rigid
   connections 17 shown in FIG. 2 to provide flexibility in the installation.
   [0060]      The support grid assembly features described herein may allow using the vessel as a
30 support structure, thereby eliminating or reducing the need for additional support elements, such
   as beams or rings that could be added to the vessel for support. The low profile of the support
   grid assembly may also increase the amount of useable volume in the vessel for media. The
                                                15

                                                                              JAWS ref: 300800AUDIV/88
   support grid assembly may further include integrated flow control vanes in the panels and the
   manifold to control and distribute fluid flow through the assembly in both the inlet and outlet
   directions.
   [0061]      One use of the support grid assemblies disclosed herein may be to be installed into
 5 the bottom head of hydroprocessing or gas dehydration vessels, which may promote liquid and
   gas flow, bed utilization, distribution and an overall efficient process.          The support grid
   assemblies may lie directly on the bottom head surface, and may allow for substantially all or
   the entire volume to be filled with media. Increased bed volume may allow for the conversion
   of existing vessels to achieve higher process capacity and new vessels to be built shorter in shell
 0 length.   An enclosed stainless steel bottom surface of the panels may prevent bed material from
   migrating under one of the panels and leaking into the flow of the process. For systems with
   coking potential, a Vee-Wire@ screen surface or wedge wire screen surface, for example, can be
   applied to the bottom and may eliminate dead areas, retaining catalyst on the bottom surfaces.
   The vessel head may support the grid directly to create a strong and rigid structure without
 5 adding special ledge rings or heavy beams to the vessel.
   [0062]      Each panel may be a totally enclosed element with a bolted and gasketed connection
   to the manifold. The enclosed design may allow the grid assembly to expand and contract under
   the bed without compromising an outer perimeter seal, which may happen in a cyclic gas
   dehydration application. During the down flow operation, the tapered design of the panels may
 0 collect flow from substantially all of or the entire cross section of the vessel and moves it toward
   the center hub outlet, and may produce a substantially uniform flow across the entire vessel and
   promote bed utilization relative to traditional bed support systems. Away from the vessel
   centerline, the volumes of catalyst or sieve may be greater. The panel may match the
   configuration shape of the vessel head, collecting flow from all areas uniformly without having
25 to cover the entire cross section of the vessel.
   [0063]      Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, those of
   ordinary skill in the art appreciate that any arrangement which is calculated to achieve the same
   purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiments shown and that the embodiments
   herein have other applications in other environments. This application is intended to cover any
30 adaptations or variations of the present disclosure. The following claims are in no way intended
   to limit the scope of the disclosure to the specific embodiments described herein. While the
   foregoing is directed to embodiments of a support grid assembly and components, other and
                                                  16

further embodiments may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the
