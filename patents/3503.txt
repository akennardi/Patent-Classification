        LIGHT EMITTING DIODE (LED) LUMINAIRES FOR ROADWAY LIGHTING
Field
[0001] The present invention relates to LED luminaires for roadway lighting.
Background
[0002] Lighting standards for public spaces and roadways in Australia and New Zealand
include two main lighting categories, V and P. Category V lighting is defined for high
traffic volume roadways and cater mainly for motorists. The roadways may include
freeways, state highways, major intersections, roundabouts, arterial and sub arterial and
main roads, speed zoning, on and off ramps, interacting carriageways and bridges.
These areas may be accompanied by high pedestrian volume, so Category V lighting
may also assist pedestrians along the roadways. Conventional Category V roadway
lighting in Australia and New Zealand typically comprise high pressure sodium (HPS)
luminaires.
[0003] Category P lighting is defined in Australia and New Zealand for low volume traffic
roadways and other outdoor public spaces, and cater mainly for pedestrians. The
roadways may include pedestrian pathways, suburban roads, parks, driveways,
cycleways, external car parks, outdoor shopping precincts, malls, town squares,
transport interchanges, subways, footbridges, ramps and stairways. These areas may
also allow vehicle access, so Category P lighting may assist drivers along the roadways.
Conventional Category P roadway lighting include HPS, mercury vapour, compact
fluorescent and linear fluorescent lamps.
[0004] In response to the widespread demand to reduce energy consumption, solid
state lighting (SSL) typically comprising LEDs are becoming an increasingly popular
lighting option. Additionally, LED lighting generally last much longer compared to
conventional HPS luminaires, which have a relatively short lifetime of around 26,000
hours.
[0005] In this context, there is a need for improved roadway lighting comprising LED
luminaires.

Description of Embodiments
[0017] Referring to the drawings, a luminaire 100 for roadway lighting according to one
embodiment comprises a body 10 having integrally-formed heat sinks 17, preferably
configured as outwardly extending fins or ridges. An LED assembly 11 is housed within
the body 10. LED driver 14 is coupled to the LED assembly 11 and configured to
regulate power transmission to the LED assembly. Encasing the LED assembly 11
within the body 10 is a diffuser 2, which is mounted to the body via a diffuser frame 1.
The diffuser 2 is configured to diffuse the "hot spots" of focused light generated by the
LEDs, to produce a more even and diffuse lighting effect without significantly affecting
light transmission. Adjustable spigot adaptor 8 is configured for mounting the luminaire
100 to a support post or other conventional mounting structure on a roadway light.
[0018] Importantly, the luminaires 100 of the present invention are specifically designed
to replace existing conventional Category V or Category P non-LED luminaires and to

                                                4
comply with requirements of the relevant lighting category as specified by Australian and
New Zealand standards. For example, Figures 1 and 2 illustrate LED luminaires suitable
for Category V and Category P lighting respectively, which may be retrofitted to existing
roadway lighting infrastructure. It will be appreciated that the LED luminaires 100 of the
present invention may also be installed on new roadway lighting infrastructure.
[0019] For example, the luminaire 100 is configured to satisfy parameters of the relevant
lighting category including luminous         intensity, photometric performance,    ingress
protection rating, colour temperature, luminaire height, post spacing, and combinations
thereof. These requirements may be as specified in public lighting standards such as
AS/NZS 1158.1 and AS/NZS 1158.6. The brightness and other photometric parameters
of the luminaire 100 are specially designed to enable the luminaire to provide a one-to
one replacement of conventional non-LED luminaires, without modification to the
existing lighting support posts. That is, the luminaire 100 is configured to comply with the
photometric requirements while retaining the existing mounting height, spacing between
light posts, etc. Figure 3 shows the photometric diagram of the luminaire of Figure 1.
[0020] The luminaire 100 may further comprise a cover 9 that is mountable to the portion
of body 10 opposite the diffuser 2. The cover 9 may be positioned over the heat sink fins
17 so that in use, the cover is at the top of the roadway light, and provides an aesthetic
finish and/or protective guard for the luminaire 100. The cover 9 may be perforated,
formed with slits 20, or otherwise configured to efficiently transfer dissipated heat from
the heat sinks 17 to the surrounds.
[0021] Body 10 is preferably constructed of a durable and heat conductive material,
such as high pressure die-cast aluminium. At least a base portion 18 of the spigot
adaptor 8 is preferably integrally formed with the body 10. A top portion 15 of the spigot
adaptor 8 may be mounted to the base portion 18 or body 10 via fasteners 16. The top
portion 15 may also be constructed of a suitable material such as aluminium. By
adjusting the fasteners 16 to vary the position of the top portion 15 relative to base
portion 18, the diameter of the opening within spigot adaptor 8 may be adjusted to fit a
range of spigot diameters. In preferred embodiments, the spigot adaptor 8 of a Category
V luminaire as illustrated in Figure 1 is preferably adjustable to receive support post
spigots of between 32 and 40 mm nominal bore size. In preferred embodiments, the
spigot adaptor 8 of a Category P luminaire as illustrated in Figure 2 is preferably
adjustable to receive support post spigots of between 20 and 25 mm nominal bore size.

                                               5
The luminaire 100 may therefore be adapted to retrofit a range of existing lighting
infrastructure.
[0022] One edge of cover 9 and adaptor cover 6 may each be hingedly connected to the
body 10 and spigot adaptor 8 respectively, and the other edge may be snap fit or friction
fit to the body 10 and spigot adaptor 8 respectively. Other equivalent and alternative
connection mechanisms may be provided. In preferred embodiments, the covers 6, 9
are constructed of a durable plastics material. In some embodiments, the covers 6, 9
may be integrally formed with each other. A cable guide 12 may be provided on or
adjacent the spigot adaptor 8 to facilitate installation.
[0023] The diffuser frame 1, driver cover 3 and/or cover plates 5 may be constructed of
aluminium or other suitable metal, and may be integrally formed with each other or
provided as separate elements. The diffuser frame 1 may be mounted to the body 10 via
fasteners 19, sandwiching edge portions of the diffuser 2 therebetween.
[0024] In some embodiments as shown in Figure 2a, a curved diffuser 2 may be formed
with planar edge flanges configured to be inserted between the diffuser frame 1 and the
body 10. In other embodiments, in particular for Category V luminaires with higher
luminance, the diffuser 2 may be substantially planar to reduce glare, as illustrated in
Figure 1a. The diffuser 2 is preferably constructed of a durable polymer with good optical
properties, such as acrylic or polycarbonates.
[0025] In the Category V embodiment as illustrated in Figure 1, the LED assembly 11
comprises 162 LEDs, and the luminaire is configured to operate at under 200 watts. In
contrast, conventional HPS Category V luminaires are typically rated at 250 watts or
higher. The specifications of the Category V luminaire according to one preferred
embodiment is as follows:

                                            6
  Number of LED's                    169
  Current Drive                     383 mA DC.
  Correlated Colour Temperature      4900k
  Colour Rendering Index:           >70
  Input Current                     990v / 305v AC.
  Systems Watts                      198
  Total Run Current                 830mA
  Lamp & Driver Life Span            100OO Hours.
  Power Factor Correction           .98 PFC
  Weight                             14kg
[0026] In the Category P embodiment as illustrated in Figure 2, the LED assembly 11
comprises 24 LEDs, and the luminaire is configured to operate at under 30 watts. In
contrast, conventional HPS Category P luminaires are typically rated at 40 watts or
higher. The specifications of the Category P luminaire according to one preferred
embodiment is as follows:
  Number of LEDS                    24
  Current Drive                     350mA
  Correlated Colour Temperature     4,500k
   Colour Rendering                  >70
  Input Voltage                     220v-305vAc
  Systems Watts                     29.1w
  Total Run Current                 0.1245 amps
   Power factor Correction          .97
  Lamp and Driver Life Span         100,000 Hours
   Ingress Protection               IP66
  Impact Rating                     IK06
  Weight                            7.1kg
[0027] The LED driver 14 is positioned spaced from the LED assembly 11 to prevent or
reduce heat generated from the driving circuitry from being transferred to the LEDs. This
ensures optimal luminance and colour temperature output from all LEDs and improves
longevity of the LED assembly. The preferred form factor of the electrical components

                                               7
(including the optional photoelectric (PE) cell 4 and terminal block 7) positioned
horizontally adjacent but spaced from the LED assembly also allows for the ultra-thin
configuration of luminaire 100. For example, the preferred embodiment of the Category
V luminaire as shown in Figure 1 is about 170 mm at its thickest point. The preferred
embodiment of the Category P luminaire as shown in Figure 2 is about 150 mm at its
thickest point.
[0028] Luminaires 100 are configured to have an expected life span of about 100,000
hours. In contrast, the lifetime of conventional HPS luminaires is typically around 26,000
hours. The specific configuration of the heat sinks 17 and positioning of the driving
circuitry away from the LED junctions prevents heating issues from affecting the lifetime
of the LEDs. Additionally, in preferred embodiments, the LEDs are driven by constant
current, to prevent excessive heat generation due to non-optimal driving current. The
driving circuitry may further be provided with thermal cut-out and surge protection
mechanisms.
[0029] The maintenance requirements of luminaires 100 are further minimised due to
the ingress protection rating of IP65 or IP66. For example, gasket 13 of spigot adaptor 8
provides weatherproof protection when adaptor cover 6 is closed.
[0030] Embodiments of the present invention provide improved roadway lighting
comprising LED luminaires that are useful for one-to-one replacement of existing non
LED luminaires. Embodiments of the present invention provide for energy savings and
reduced maintenance costs compared to conventional non-LED roadway lighting.
[0031] For the purpose of this specification, the word "comprising" means "including but
not limited to", and the word "comprises" has a corresponding meaning.
[0032] It is to be understood that other specific arrangements of parts, example devices,
systems, and environments may be used and structural and functional modifications
may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. Also, while the
terms "top", "bottom", "front", back", "rear", "side", "vertical", "lateral" and the like may be
used in this specification to describe various example features and elements of the
invention, these terms are used herein as a matter of convenience; eg based on the
example orientations shown in the figures. Nothing in this specification should be
construed as requiring a specific three dimensional orientation of structures in order to
fall within the scope of this invention.
