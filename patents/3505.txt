                                         ABSTRACT
 5
   A filter assembly 10 comprises a container 12 having a filter inlet 14 and a filter outlet
   16. A filter medium 18 is supported by a frame 20 inside the container 12. The frame
   20 supports the filter medium 18 in a manner such that all liquid that enters the
   container through the inlet 14 must pass through the filter medium 18 in order to flow
10 from the outlet 16. The frame 20 comprises first and second parts 22a and 22b
   between which the filter medium 18 is held. The frame 20 can be removed from the
   container 12 enabling the filter medium 18 to be either cleaned and reused or simply
   replaced with a fresh filter medium.

   Technical Field
 5 This specification discloses a filter assembly particularly, although not exclusively, for
   association with rain water or other potable water storage tanks.
   Background Art
10 Rainwater tanks are commonly used to supplement domestic water supply. The water
   from rainwater tanks can be used for example for irrigation of a garden or directed to
   various water consuming appliances within a house such as a clothes washing
   machine or toilets. Rainwater is channelled into the tank usually via a downpipe
   connected with a gutter. The gutter in turn receives water from a catchment area such
15 as a roof of a building.
   In many instances the rainwater is fed directly into the tank. Therefore dirt and other
   contaminants that are entrained with the rain water also flow into the tank. The
   contaminants tend to settle on the bottom of the tank. In time this can accumulate to
20 the extent that the contaminants become entrained in the rainwater supplied from the
   tank. To remedy this, a user would ordinarily seek to clean the tank.
   The entrainment of contaminants in the consumed water can be exacerbated when
   provided under pressure. For example if a pump is provided to supply water from the
25 tank under pressure, the action of the pump may have the effect of mixing
   contaminants and water within the tank prior to discharge by the pump.
   In some rainwater collection systems it is known to divert an initial volume of rainwater
   from entering the tank. The idea here is that the initial volume of water is considered
30 most likely to contain the greatest proportion of contaminants. Therefore by diverting
   or otherwise dumping this initial volume the subsequent rainwater will be carrying a
   much lower proportion of contaminants. This slows down the build-up of contaminants
   within the tank.
35 The above described background art is not intended to limit the application of the filter
   assembly, and associated water system and method of providing filtered water as
   disclosed herein.
                                                                     9761962_1 (GHMatters) P98210.AU.1 5/12/17

   Description of Specific Embodiments
20 Figures 1a - 5e depict one embodiment of the disclosed filter assembly 10 and
   associated component parts. The filter assembly 10 comprises a container 12 having
   a filter inlet 14 and a filter outlet 16. A filter medium 18 (shown most clearly in Figures
   5b and 5c) is supported by a frame 20 inside the container 12. The frame 20 supports
   the filter medium 18 in a manner such that all liquid that enters the container through
25 the inlet 14 must pass through the filter medium 18 in order to flow from the outlet 16.
   The frame 20 comprises first and second parts 22a and 22b (hereinafter referred to in
   general as "frame parts 22") between which the filter medium 18 is held. The frame 20
   can be easily removed from the container 12. In this way the filter medium 18 can be
   either cleaned and reused or simply replaced with a fresh filter medium 18.
30
   The container 12 is assembled from two main components a first body portion 24 and
   a demountably connected lid 26. For convenience the first body portion 24 will be
   hereinafter referred to as "canister 24".       The canister 24 has a bottom wall 30. On an
   inside of the bottom wall 30 is a raised profiled seat 56. At one end of the bottom wall
35 30 is a drain 32. The drain 32 is surrounded by an annular wall 34 having a screw
   thread 36 on its outer circumferential surface. A drain cap 37 screws onto the thread
   36 to close the drain 32.
                                                                       9761962_1 (GHMatters) P98210.AU.1 5/12/17

                                                 -5
   Referring in particular to Figures 3a-3d the canister 24 has two parallel cylindrical
   portions 38 and 40. The portions 38 and 40 are spaced apart and connected together
   by side walls 42 and 44. An end 46 of the canister 24 opposite the bottom wall 30 is
 5 open or at least defines an opening. The lid 26 is demountably coupled over the
   opening at the end 46. When the lid 26 is removed as shown in Figure 3a the frame
   20 is accessible and can be removed from the filter assembly 10.
   The cylindrical parts 38 and 40 have circumferential inner walls 48 and 50 respectively,
10 each of which extends for approximately 2700. Both of the walls 48 and 50 lead to
   opposite planar walls 52 and 54. A pair of diametrically opposed ribs 58 is formed on
   the circumferential wall 48 extending for the length of the cylindrical part 38. A pair of
   diametrically opposed ribs 60 is also formed on the inner circumferential wall 50 and
   extending for the full length of the cylindrical part 40.
15
   A lip 62 extends about the opening at the end 46 of the canister 24. The lip 62 extends
   laterally from the open end 46. A short upright wall 64 circumscribes the lip 62.
   With particular reference to Figures 3b and 3c the canister 24 is also provided with six
20 clip seats 66, three on each side. The clip seats 66 are formed immediately
   underneath the lip 62 on the opposite sides of the canister 24.
   Figures 4a and 4b illustrate the lid 26 that is demountably coupled to the canister 24.
   The lid has a planar weblike base 70 with a footprint configured to substantially match
25 that of the lip 62. The inlet 14 and outlet 16 are connected with and in this embodiment
   formed integrally with the base 70. Each of the inlet 14 and the outlet 16 is in the form
   of a 900 elbow pipe fitting. On an inside surface of the base 70 there is a profiled track
   72. The track 72 is configured to receive an end of the frame assembly 20.
30 On the outer side of the base 70 and on each side of the lid 26 are sets of three clip
   seats 74. A short wall 76 extends about an inside of the base 70. When the lids 26 is
   demountably coupled to the canister 24 the walls 76 and 64 fit one inside the other
   (shown in Fig 2a).
35 With particular reference to Figures 5a - 5e the filter frame 20 is formed of two parts
   22a and 22b which are in a mutual overlying relationship. The filter medium 18 is
   sandwiched between the parts 22a and 22b. The frame 20 is formed with a first set of
                                                                    9761962_1 (GHMatters) P98210.AU.1 5/12/17

                                                 -6
   fins 80ec, 80a and 80eo (hereinafter referred to in general as "fins 80") and a second
   set of fins 82eo, 82a and 82ec (hereinafter referred to in general as "fins 82"). Fins 80
   and 82 are on opposite sides of the frame 20. The fins 80 and 82 are arranged so that
   the frame is configured to form a slight interference fit within the canister 24. In
 5 particular, the fins 80 and 82 will contact the inner surface of the canister 24. This
   serves two functions. Firstly the pressure created on the frame 20 by this interference
   fit effectively holds or presses the filter medium 18 between the paths 22a and 22b.
   Secondly the interference fit creates substantial seals between the contact areas of the
   inside surface of the canister 24 and the frame 20.
10
   The fins 80ec and 80eo are end fins of the part 22a while the fins 80a are intermediate
   finds lined between the end fins 80ec and 80eo. Each of the fins 80a and 80eo are
   provided with openings allowing the through flow of liquid. However the end fin 80ec is
   a closed fin which does not allow any through flow liquid. The end fins 80ec and 80eo
15 are of an arcuate shape extending for approximately 1%of a circle and have straight
   longitudinal edges 84. The end fins 80ec and 80eo extend into the cylindrical parts 38
   and 40 of the canister 24. The straight edges 84 of the end fins 80ec and 80eo also
   abut with the ribs 58 and 60 respectively on one side of the canister 24.
20 The arrangement of fins 82 on the second part 22b is similar to that described above in
   relation to the part 22a. The fins 82a lie between the end fins 82eo and 82ec. Each of
   fins 82eo and 82ec is curved, extending for approximately 900 and configured to
   extend into the cylindrical portions 38 and 40. Longitudinal straight edges 85 of the
   end fins 82eo and 82ec abut the ribs 58 and 60 on an adjacent side of the canister 24.
25
   The intermediate fins 80a and 82a are staggered with respect to each other. However
   the end fins 82ec and 82eo are directly opposite each other as are the end fins 82eo
   and 82ec. Together the end fins 82ec and 82eo; and the end fins 82eo and 82ec form
   semi-cylindrical structures.
30
   Figures 5d and 5e illustrate the parts 22a and 22b separately from each other. With
   particular reference to Figure 5d the part 22a comprises a support portion 87. Each of
   the fins 80 extends to one side of the support portion 87. The support portion 87 has a
   generally undulating or corrugated configuration. The intermediate fins 80a extend
35 from the crest of each corrugation. The fins 80ec and 80eo extend from opposite sides
   of the support portion 87 from an edge that lies at a level between the crests and
   troughs of the support portion 87. Solid ribs 88 extend along each of the troughs. A
                                                                      9761962_1 (GHMatters) P98210.AU.1 5/12/17

                                                 -7
   plurality of slots or openings 89 are formed in the support portion 87 to allow the
   passage of liquid.
   With reference to Figure 5e the part 22b comprises a support portion 90 of an
 5 undulating or corrugated configuration. The fins 82a extend from the same side of the
   support portion 90. The intermediate fins 82a extend from the troughs of each
   corrugation in the support portion 90. The opposite end fins 82ec and 82eo extend
   from opposite sides of the support portion 90 at a level intermediate the crests and
   troughs. Solid ribs 91 extend along each of the crests. A plurality of openings or slots
10 93 formed in the support portion 90 to allow the flow of liquid through the support
   portion 90.
   An end 92 of the frame 20 shown in Figure 5a is configured to seat within the track 72
   formed on the inside of the lid 26. A substantial seal is formed between the end 92
15 and the track 72. An opposite end 94 of the frame 20 as shown in Figure 5b is formed
   with a track 95 which is configured to receive the raised seat 56 on the inside of the
   bottom wall 30 of the canister 24. When the raised seat 56 is fitted within the end
   94/track 95 a substantial seal is formed. Further, as explained in greater detail below
   with reference to a second embodiment, the end 92 of one frame 20 is configured to
20 engage in and form a substantial seal with an end 94 of another identical frame 20.
   Figure 3a depicts the frame 20 inside of the canister 24. The fins 80 and 82 abut
   against inner surfaces of the canister 24. Substantial seals are formed between the
   longitudinal edges of the intermediate fins 80a and 82a and the inner surfaces 52 and
25 54 respectively. A substantial seal is also formed between the fin 80ec and a part of
   the circumferential wall 48; and a substantial seal is formed between the fin 82ec and a
   part of the inner circumferential wall 50.
   The lid 26 is attached to the canister 24 with the inlet 14 above the cylindrical portion
30 40 and the outlet 16 above the cylindrical portion 38. If water flows in through the inlet
    14 it can only reach the outlet 16 by flowing firstly through the fin 80ec then through the
   filter medium 18 and subsequently through the fin 82eo. Therefore by virtue of this
   arrangement all water flowing into the filter 10 must pass through the filter medium 18
   in order to exit from the outlet 16. It is not possible for water to bypass the filter
35 medium 18. In particular water is unable to flow from the cylinder portion 40 between
   the fin 82ec and the circumferential wall 50. This flow is firstly blocked by way of the
   rib 60 abutting the edge 85 of the fin 82ec and secondly by a surface area of the fin
                                                                      9761962_1 (GHMatters) P98210.AU.1 5/12/17

                                                 -8
   82ec pressing against the inner circumferential surface 50. If desired a sealing strip or
   band for example made from a rubber material can be provided between the fin 82ec
   and the surface 50. This can be achieved for example by way of forming a longitudinal
   groove in the surface 50 and seating a rubber strip in the groove.
 5
   By making the canister 24 from a transparent material it is possible for a user to
   visually inspect the state of the filter 18. If the filter appears dirty the lid 26 can be
   removed and the frame 20 pulled out and disassembled so that the filter medium 18
   can be replaced. The filter medium 18 can be replaced with either a fresh filter
10 medium 18 or the existing filter medium can be washed and reused.
   In the event that foreign material builds up within the canister 24 the drain cap 38 can
   be unscrewed and the canister 24 flushed.
15 Reverting back to Figures 1a - 2b, the lid 26 is demountably retained on the canister
   24 by way of clips 98. The clips 98 are in the form of resilient clips made from plastics
   or metal material that snap over mutually aligned clip seats 66 and 74 on the canister
   24 and lid 26 respectively.
20 The volumetric capacity of the filter assembly 10 can be increased by increasing the
   volume of the container 12. One way of doing this is to form the container 12 in a
   manner so that a plurality of canisters can be coupled together, and providing a filter
   medium that is operable for the plurality of the canisters. For example the volume of
   the filter 10 can be doubled by adding a second stage 100 shown in Figures 6a-8b.
25 The first stage 11 is the combination of the canister 24 together with the filter medium
   18 and the frame 20 as shown in Figure 3a. The second stage 100 comprises the
   combination of a second canister 24', second filter medium 18 and second frame 20.
   The second stage 100 differs from the first stage 11 only by way of the physical form of
   the second canister 24'. Thus the container 12 in this embodiment is the combination
30 of the canister 24 and the canister 24'.
   Referring to Figures 6a and 6b the second canister 24' differs from the first canister 24
   only by way of the replacement of the bottom wall 30 of the canister 24 with a
   circumferential lip 62' and the addition of further clip seats 66'. The second lip 62' is of
35 identical configuration to the lip 62. The clip seats 66' are also of identical
   configuration to the clip seats 60. In all other respects the canister 24' is of identical
   configuration to the canister 24. Figure 6c shows the frame 20 and filter medium 18 of
                                                                        9761962_1 (GHMatters) P98210.AU.1 5/12/17

                                                -9
   the second stage 100 within the canister 24'.
   Figures 7a - 8b depict an embodiment of the filter assembly 10' which comprises the
   first 11 and second stages 100 connected together. The end 92 of the filter in the first
 5 canister 24 fits in the end 94 of the frame 20 in the second canister 24'. The end 92 of
   the frame in the second canister 24' engages in the track 72 of the lid 26. The lid 26 is
   fitted to the end of the canister 24'. The canister 24 is coupled to the canister 24' by a
   set of clips 106.
10 The canister 24' may also be made of a transparent material or is otherwise provided
   with windows to enable visualisation of the corresponding filter medium 18. It will be
   understood that the filter assembly 10' is now of twice the volume of the filter assembly
   10 shown in Figures 1a - 5d. The filter assembly 10/10' can be easily mounted on a
   wall or surface by clips 108 shown in Figures 7a-8b. The clips 108 are able to engage
15 about the cylindrical portions 38 and 40 as well as the inlet and outlet 14 and 16.
   In use it is envisaged that a supply pipe or hose is attached to the inlet 14 and the
   outlet 16 is plumbed to a storage tank. For example the filter assembly 10/10' can be
   coupled to a rain water tank. The inlet 14 can be plumbed to downpipes or gutters of a
20 building. An associated roof of the building forms a catchment area. When it rains the
   rain runs down the roof into the gutter down the drainpipe and into the inlet 14. In
   order for the water to exit the outlet 16 and thus flow into the storage tank the water
   must pass through the filter medium 18. The water is gravity fed through the filter
   assembly 10.
25
   As a result of the action of the filter assembly 10/10' the water leaving the outlet 16 and
   flowing into the storage tank is clean being free of dirt and pathogens which are
   blocked by the filter medium 18. From time to time the filter medium 18 can be
   removed by disassembly of the floor assembly 10. No tools are required to
30 disassemble the filter assembly 10 or build it back together. As described above a
   dirty filter medium 18 can either be washed and reused or alternately discarded and
   replaced with a fresh filter medium 18.
   Whilst the specific embodiment of the filter assembly has been described it will be
35 apparent that it may be embodied in many other forms. For example, while the volume
   of the filter assembly 10/1 0'can be augmented by st acking of a second or more stages
   a similar effect can be achieved by connecting a plurality of for example single stage
                                                                     9761962_1 (GHMatters) P98210.AU.1 5/12/17

                                                - 10
   filter assemblies in series with each other. Also the end fins 80eo, 80ec, 82eo and
   82ec do not need to be formed in an arcuate configuration as shown in the present
   embodiment. These fins can be planar fins similar to the intermediate fins 80a and
   82a. If formed in this manner then the canister 24 can be reconfigured to have
 5 respective planar surfaces at right angles to the surfaces 52 and 54 against which the
   end fins can abut. It is the function and not the physical configuration of the end fins
   mating with the surfaces of the canister which necessitates liquid passing through the
   filter medium 18 in order to flow from the inlet 14 to the outlet 16. This is exemplified
   by a further variation shown in Figure 9 which depicts an embodiment of the disclosed
10 filter assembly designated as 10a.
   In Figure 9 the features of the filter assembly 10a that are the same or similar in
   structure or function are designated with the same reference numbers as in the
   description of the filter assembly 10. The filter assembly 10a has frame 20 made of
15 two parts 22a and 22b which support the filter medium 18. Each of the parts has a set
   of fins. The fins of the first part 22a are arranged as set of alternate liquid impervious
   fins 80m, and liquid pervious fins 80p. The fins of the second part 22b are arranged as
   set of alternate liquid impervious fins 82m, and liquid pervious fins 82p. The liquid
   pervious fins may have the same physical structure as the fins 80a or 82a described
20 above, i.e. are provided with holes or slots to allow the flow of a liquid. The liquid
   impervious fins are solid webs of material similar too fins 80ec and 82ec, but of course
   of different configuration.
   The fins in the first set are directly opposite respective fins of the second set. In each
25 pair of directly opposite fins one is pervious and the other is impervious. Thus an
   impervious fin 80m or 82m is opposite a pervious fin 82p or 80p respectively. Figure 9
   also shows the support portions 87 and 90 as being planar rather than undulating.
   However the arrangement of fins shown in Figure 9 can also be used with undulating
   support portions as shown in Figure 5a. It will also be seen that in this embodiment the
30 canister 24a is rectangular rather than having cylindrical end portions. The fins at each
   end of the frame 20 abut ribs 58 and 60. The dashed line W depicts a liquid flow path
   from an end portion 40a located above an inlet (not shown) of a lid (not shown) of the
   filter assembly 10a to an end portion 38 below an outlet (not shown) of the lid of the
   filter assembly.
