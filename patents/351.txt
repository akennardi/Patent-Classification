                   STEERABLE GUIDING SHEATH WITH RACK AND PINION
                                   DEFLECTION MECHANISM
  FIELD OF INVENTION
  [0001]      This invention relates to a guiding sheath which is especially suitable for guiding
  electrophysiology catheter, in particular, a deflectable guiding sheath.
  BACKGROUND
  [0002]      Guiding sheaths are well known for use in facilitating pathway for a treatment or
  diagnostic catheter.     Catheterization of the human heart often necessitates having a
  catheter gain access to the heart chambers, via a femoral vein and the aorta. To provide
  variation in movement, guiding sheaths (much like the catheters that are passed through
  the guiding sheaths) may be steerable or deflectable with the use of one or more puller
  wires for improved maneuverability in the patient's vasculature.
  [0003]     Accordingly, there is a desire for a guiding sheath with improved deflection
  characteristics and smoother operation in deflection mechanisms of the control handle.

  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
  [0030]      Referring to FIG. 1, in some embodiment of present invention, a guiding sheath
  assembly 10 includes an elongated and flexible sheath 12, and a control handle 16
  proximal of sheath 12.       The sheath 12 includes a proximal section 13 and a distal
  deflection section 14. The control handle 16 may be connected to an electrical connector
   17 for transmitting electrical signals, as sensed by one or more ring electrodes 19 carried
  on the sheath 12, including, for example, the deflection section 14. Also attached to the
  control handle 16, as shown in FIG. 1, is a hemostatic valve 18 adapted to receive a
  catheter (not shown) that can be advanced through a center lumen 22 of the guiding
  sheath assembly 10 (fix FIG. 1).          The hemostatic valve 18 also has side port 21
  terminating in a luer hub, such as a two-way stop cock 23, for connection to one or more
  fluid sources (not shown) for providing fluid into and through the lumen 22 of the guiding
  sheath assembly 10.
  [0031]      As shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, the control handle 16 includes an elongated,
0 generally cylindrical main body 24 with a narrower distal portion or stem 25, and a distal
  rotational control knob 26 mounted on the distal portion stem 25. The main body 24 has
  an outer shell-half member formed to define an interior volume V and whose edges 51
  meet along a longitudinal seam. The distal stem 25 of the main body has a smaller outer
  diameter D1 compared to the outer diameter D2 of a proximal portion of the main body 24.
5 The control knob 26 is configured for rotation by a user's thumb and forefinger when the
  user is grasping the main body 24 of the control handle 16. To enable deflection of the
                                                 -6
  3427971vl

  deflection section 14 of the guiding sheath 12 via first and second puller wires 30A and
  30B, the control handle 16 includes in its interior volume V a rotatable shaft 31, first and
  second shuttles 32A and 32B, and a pinion 34. The rotatable shaft 31 is responsive to the
  control knob 26 in driving first shuttle 32A to move linearly along a longitudinal axis 55 in a
  first direction, and the pinion 34 couples the second shuttle 32B to the first shuttle 32A
  such that the second shuttle 32B moves linearly along the longitudinal axis in a second
  direction opposition to the first direction. With proximal ends of the first and second puller
  wires 30A and 30B anchored, or at least coupled, to the first and second shuttles 32A and
  32B, respectively, such coupled and opposite translational movement of the first and
  second shuttles actuate the first and second puller wires for bi-directional deflection of the
  deflection section 14 of the guiding sheath 12.
  [0032]       The rotatable shaft 31 has a main proximal section 36 with an outer diameter
  D3, a shorter distal section 37 with an outer diameter D4, and a step junction J
  therebetween between sections 36 and 37. In the illustrated embodiment, the diameter
  D3 is greater than the diameter D4, but it is understood that the two diameters may be
  generally equal or the diameter D4 may be greater than the diameter D3. As better seen
  in FIG. 2, the rotatable shaft 31 is situated relative to main body 24 of the control handle
0  16 such that its proximal section 36 extends through both the main body 24 and the distal
  stem 25 of the control handle 16 and past a distal end of the distal stem 25, with the
  junction J and the distal section 37 being distal of the distal stem 25 of the main body 24
  so that the distal section 37 is not surrounded by the distal stem 25. The rotatable shaft
  31 is connected and affixed at its proximal end to the main body 24 by a proximal outer
5 circumferential lip 38 that engages with an inner circumferential slot defined between
  circumferential flanges 40 formed in the interior volume V of the main body 24.

  [0033]     With reference to FIG. 4, the rotatable shaft 31 is hollow having an interior
  passage 42. The passage 42 is in communication with a distal inlet 44 whose diameter is
  merely slightly greater than the diameter of the guiding sheath 12. The passage 42 is
  threaded and has a diameter to accommodate both the guiding sheath 12 and the shuttles
  32A and 32B circumferentially surrounding the guiding sheath 12, as discussed below in
  further detail.
  [0034]     The control knob 26, which is mounted on the distal stem 25 of the main body
  24 of the control handle 16 and the rotatable shaft 31, has a main proximal portion 46 and
  a short distal end portion 47.        The control knob 26 is generally cylindrical with a
  longitudinal hollow interior that extends through its entire length. The hollow interior has a
  main proximal section 49, a mid-section 49' and a distal section 49". The main proximal
  section 49 of the hollow interior is defined by a greater first radius R1 and a greater first
  length L1 to accommodate and circumferentially surround the guiding sheath 12 and the
  shuttles 32A and 32B. The distal section 49" of the hollow interior is defined by a lesser
  second radius R2, where R1>R2, and a shorter second length L2, where L1>L2, to
  accommodate and circumferentially surround the guiding sheath 12 and the distal section
  37 of the rotatable shaft 31. The mid-section 49' of the hollow interior is defined by a third
0 radius R3, where R1>R3>R2, and a third length L3, where L1>L3, to accommodate and
  circumferentially surround the guiding sheath 12 and the junction J of the rotatable shaft
  31. A friction-inducing cover 60 may be mounted on an outer surface of the control knob
  26 for the user's ease and comfort in manipulating and rotating the control knob relative to
  the main body 24 of the control handle 16.
5 [0035]     To rotationally couple the rotatable shaft 31 to the control knob 26, an outer
  surface of the distal section of the shaft has a longitudinal ridge 70 (FIG. 3) that is
                                                -8
  3427971vl

  received in and engages with a corresponding longitudinal recess 71 (FIG. 4) formed an
  inner surface defining the hollow interior 49" of the control knob 26. To translationally affix
  the control knob 26 to the rotatable shaft 31 and hence the main body 24, the outer
  surface of the shaft 31 also has one or more linear slots 74 oriented perpendicularly to the
  longitudinal axis of the rotatable shaft 31.  Each slot 74 is aligned with a respective hole
  76 (FIG. 5) formed through a side of the distal end portion 47 of the control knob 26, so
  that a respective pin 77 may be inserted into the hole 76 and the slot 74 to couple the
  control knob 26 and the rotatable shaft 31.
  [0036]     It is understood that other embodiments of the guiding sheath assembly may
  provide a rotatable shaft 31 with an exposed portion for direct manipulation by a user,
  without the control knob 26.
  [0037]     As shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 5, the shuttles 32A and 32B have a similar
  construction to each other, with the understanding that each is generally a mirror image of
  the other, although the first shuttle 32A is driven by the rotatable shaft 31 and second
  shuttle 32B is driven by the first shuttle 32A via the pinion 34 situated between them.
  Each shuttle 32A and 32B has a respective elongated body having a distal portion 80A
  and 80B with a C-shaped end cross-section, and a respective proximal rack portion 90A
0 and 90B with a respective plurality of teeth 92A and 92B arranged longitudinally. The first
  and second shuttles are arranged to face each other and engage the pinion 34 such that
  the distal portions 80A and 80BC together can form a cylindrical form with an outer
  circumferential surface that fits within the threaded          passage 42, and an        inner
  circumferential surface that defines a passage 93 for the guiding sheath 12 to pass
5 through. As shown in FIG. 5, the rack portion 90A and 90B of each shuttle faces each
  other with the pinion 34 in between so that the teeth 92A and 92B of each rack portion can
                                                -9
  3427971vl

  engage with teeth of the pinion 34 which is mounted for rotation about an axis
  perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 55 of the control handle 16.
  [0038]      With reference to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, an outer surface of the distal portion 80A of
  the first shuttle 32A is configured with an external or male threaded surface 85. An inner
  circumferential surface of the rotatable shaft 31 is configured with an internal or female
  threaded surface 86 (FIG. 4) which receives the male threaded surface 85 of the first
  shuttle 32A for coupling the first shuttle 32A and the rotatable shaft 31 in converting
  rotational movement of the rotatable shaft 31 into translation movement of the first shuttle
  32A. In contrast, the outer surface of the distal portion 80B of the second shuttle 32B is
  smooth, without any feature engaging the threaded female surface of the rotatable, so that
  it can move independently of the threaded male surface 85.             Accordingly, as a user
  rotates the control knob 26 in a first direction, the rotatable shaft 31 which is rotationally
  coupled to the control knob 26 via the longitudinal ridge 70 also rotates.            With the
  rotatable shaft 31 rotationally and translationally locked to the control knob 26 via the
  longitudinal ridge 70 and the one or more pins 77, rotation of the shaft 31 drives the first
  shuttle 32A to translate along the longitudinal axis in a first direction (for example,
  proximally). As the first shuttle 32A translates, its teeth 92A drive the pinion 34 to rotate in
0 a first direction (for example, clockwise), which in turn drives the second shuttle 32B to
  translate along the longitudinal axis 55 in a second direction opposite of the first direction
  (for example, distally). So arranged, the male and female threaded surfaces 85 and 86
  convert rotational movement of the control knob 26 into linear movement of the shuttles
  32A and 32B.       With proximal ends of the first and second puller wires 30A and 30B
5 anchored, coupled or otherwise responsive to the first and second shuttles 32A and 32B,
  respectively, linear and opposite movements of the shuttles actuate the puller wires for bi
                                                -10

  directional deflection of the deflection section 14 of the guiding sheath 12.          In the
  illustrated embodiment, the proximal ends of the puller wires 30A and 30B are coupled to
  the rack portions 90A and 90B of the shuttles 32A and 32B, respectively. Thus, when one
  puller wire is drawn proximally under tension by its respective shuttle, the other puller wire
  is simultaneously released from tension by its respective shuttle moving distally.
  [0039]      As shown in FIG. 2, a proximal end segment of each puller wire 30A and 30B
  extends outside of the sheath 12, in a respective longitudinal channel 88A and 88B
  formed in the proximal rack portion 90A and 90B of each shuttle 32A and 32B. As shown
  in FIG. 5, a stop 89A and 89B, for example, a hypotube, is affixed to the proximal end of
  each puller wire 30A and 30B, and the stop is positioned proximal of a proximal end 87A
  and 87B of the respective rack portion 90A and 90B so that the rack portion can push or
  otherwise act on the stop 89A and 89B, respectively, to draw the puller wire 30A and 30B
  proximally when the shuttle 32A and 32B is moved proximally. When a shuttle 32A and
  32B is moved distally, the proximal end of the rack portion 90A and 90B comes out of
  contact with the stop 89A and 89B, releasing the puller wire 30A and 30B from tension. It
  is understood that the stop 89A and 89B may also be embedded or otherwise anchored to
  the rack portion or any part of the shuttle to effect deflection of the sheath.
0 [0040]      Because the first and second shuttles 32A and 32B move in opposite directions
  along the longitudinal axis 55, an initial positioning of the shuttles relative to each other
  and to the passage 42 is made during assembly of the control handle. For example, as
  shown in FIG. 2, each shuttle is positioned in the passage 42 of the rotatable shaft 31
  such that they are even with each other along the longitudinal axis 55, and each has a
5 distal end positioned generally at mid-point along the passage 42 so that each shuttle has
  sufficient room to move correspondingly proximally or distally within the rotatable shaft 31.
                                                -11
  3427971vl

  The stops 89A and 89B may be positioned relative to the shuttles such that there is
  minimal or even tension exerted on each puller wire 30A and 30B for a generally neutral
  guiding sheath with little, if any, deflection. So arranged, the shuttles adopt a "neutral" or
  initial configuration from which the user may evenly deflect the guiding sheath bi
  directionally.
  [0041]     As shown in FIG. 5, the pinion 34 is positioned in between and relative to the
  shuttles 32A and 32B so that their teeth 92A and 92B remain engaged while the shuttles
  translate in response the user's manipulation of the control knob 26. In that regard, the
  length of the rack portions 90A and 90B are sufficiently long to ensure such continuous
  engagement.
  [0042]     It is understood that by changing one or more factors, including, for example,
  the length of the passage 42, the length of each distal portion 80A and 80B, the length of
  the rack portion 90A and 90B, the position of the pinion 34, and the number of pinions,
  different shuttle movement and deflection characteristics and limitations may be achieved,
  as needed or desired.
  [0043]     With reference to FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B, an outer surface of each rack portion
  90A and 90B, opposite of the teeth 92A and 92B, of each shuttle 32A and 32B is
0 configured with a neutral indicator. The neutral indicator includes a first member 62A and
  a second member 62B configured for releasable engagement with each other to indicate a
  neutral position between the first and second shuttles 32A and 32B, that is, a relative
  position where the puller wires 30A and 30B are neutral and the guiding sheath 12
  accordingly is generally straight, without deflection. In the illustrated embodiment, the first
5 or male member 62A formed on the first shuttle 32A has a tapered projection 63 facing
  the second or female member 62B formed on the second shuttle 32B, which includes a
                                                 -12
  3427971vl

  pair of flexible guide rails 64 on either side, whose fixed ends 65 are affixed to the second
  shuttle 32B and whose free ends 66 are configured to jointly form a tapered recess 67 in
  which the tapered projection 63 nests when the shuttles 32A and 32B are in the neutral
  configuration.
  [0044]      Accordingly, the user is typically initially presented with the guiding sheath 12
  undeflected where the first and second shuttles 32A and 32B are even with each other
  with the tapered projection 63 nesting in the tapered recess 67, as shown in FIG. 6A.
  When the user rotates the control knob 26 in one direction which drives the first and
  second shuttles 32A and 32B to translate in opposition directions, as shown in FIG. 6B,
  the tapered projection 63 disengages and moves out from the tapered recess 67 but only
  when the user rotates the control knob with sufficient force to flex the guide rails 64 and
  overcome the resistance presented by their angled ends 68. When the tapered projection
  63 rides over and has moved past one of the angled ends 68, the guide rail 64 is sloped
  such that the resistance to movement of the tapered projection 63 decreases as the
  tapered projection 63 moves further away from the tapered recess 67. Thus, in rotating
  the control knob 26 to deflect the guiding sheath 12, the user experiences a greater or
  maximum resistance when the shuttles 32A and 32B initially move out of the neutral
0 configuration, followed by increasing ease as the shuttles 32A and 32B translate in
  opposite directions. The control handle 16 may bear visual and/or tactile indicia to provide
  constant orientation of deflection direction. For example, clockwise rotation of the control
  knob 26 consistently deflects the shaft 12 toward the side or direction of the sideport 21,
  and counterclockwise rotation of the control knob 26 consistently deflects the shaft 12
5 toward an opposite side or direction.

  [0045]     Conversely, when releasing the deflection of the guiding sheath 12, the user
  rotates the control knob 26 in the opposite direction.        As the shuttles 32A and 32B
  translate and approach each other and begin to laterally realign again, the tapered
  projection 63 and the tapered recess 67 approach each other and the user applies an
  increasing force to rotate the control knob 26 in order for the tapered projection 63 to ride
  back over the angled end 68 of a guide rail 64 before the tapered projection 63 can nest in
  the tapered recess 67.      Accordingly, the increasing resistance posed by either of the
  sloped rails 64 and a greater or maximum resistance posed by an angled end 68 provides
  the user with a tactile feel or indication of when the tapered projection 63 is in the
  immediate proximity of the tapered recess 67. Engagement of the tapered projection 63
  and the tapered recess 67 can provide the user with an audible "click" or signal when the
  flexible guide rail 64 snaps into its natural configuration when the tapered projection 63 no
  longer exerts any load on it.
