                                Improvement in Hinges
Technical Field
[001]   The invention relates to a hinge, more particularly, the invention relates to a
security pivot hinge, an assembly including such a hinge, a section member and an
associated method of use.
Background
[002]   Hinges are commonly used to connect a door or window to a supporting frame
or surface. One such hinge is a pivot hinge that may connect a metal, typically an
aluminium frame of a door or window, to a supporting frame. The frame of the door
or window typically has a hollow rectangular cross-section. The pivot hinge includes
a base arranged to couple to the supporting frame or surface, and a bracket pivotally
coupled to the base. The base includes apertures that allow the base to be secured to
the supporting frame via a fastener.
[003]   The bracket is L-shaped in section having a support portion on which the
frame of the door or window seats and an upturned section which abuts with an
external lengthwise surface of the frame of the door or window. The upturned section
includes apertures arranged to allow the upturned section to be secured via a fastener
to the external face of the aluminium frame of the door or window.
[004]   A problem with these pivot hinges is that the fasteners that secure the upturned
section are accessible and visible, and therefore have associated security and aesthetic
issues. Moreover, a problem with the rectangular cross-section of the frame of the
door or window is related to the fit, or lack thereof, between the pivot hinge and the
rectangular cross-section.
[005]   The invention disclosed herein seeks to overcome one or more of the above
identified problems or at least provide a useful alternative.

Detailed Description
[0033] Referring to Figures 1 to 14, there is shown a hinge 10 for pivotally coupling a
section member 12 to a supporting surface. The hinge 10 includes a base 16 adapted
to couple to the surface and a support or bracket 18 pivotally coupled to the base 16.
The section member 12 may be a section, profile or part of a door or window frame or
the like and the surface may be any surface such as a sill, support frame or the like to
which the hinge 10, namely the base 16, is coupled. The section member 12 may be a
substantially hollow section being rectangular in cross section having an at least
partially open end 22, opposing generally flat front and back sides 23 and relatively
narrower opposing sides 25. At least one of the opposing sides 25 includes a
lengthwise channel or recess 26.
[0034] Turning to the hinge 10 in more detail, the support 18 of the hinge 10 includes
a first portion 20 adapted to support and locate an at least partially open end 22 of the
section member 12 and a second portion 24 extending at a perpendicular angle from
the first portion 20 and being arranged to be receivable by and located with the
channel 26 of the section member 12. The section member 12 is generally seated on
the first portion 20.
[0035] The second portion 24 having an aperture 28 therein so as to allow the second
portion 24 to be securable to the channel 26 with a fastener (not shown). In this
example, two spaced apart apertures 28a and 28b are provided with one being
elongate to allow for tolerance, as shown in Figure 4.
[0036] The first portion 20 includes a flat body 29 having a free end 30 and a coupled
end 32 having an aperture 33 that is coupled by a pivot arrangement 34 to the base 16.
The section member 12 is generally seated on the first portion 20 in use.

                                            -6
[0037] Similarly, the base 16 includes a relatively flat body 31 having a free end 41
and a coupled end 43 having an aperture 45 that aligns with the aperture 33 so as to be
coupled to the first portion 20 by the pivot arrangement 34. The apertures 33, 45 are
offset to one side of the respective coupled ends 32, 43.
[0038] The pivot arrangement 34 may include a small lug fitted through apertures 33,
45 and a spacing disk made from a suitable metal or plastic. The flat body 29 of the
first portion 20 and the flat body 31 of the base 16 have surfaces 17, 19 that are
proximate, and closely spaced, and arranged to move past one another during pivoting
of the hinge 10. The pivot arrangement 34 is connected so as to space apart the
surfaces 17, 19.
[0039] The first portion 20 includes a locator 36 receivable by the at least partially
open end 22. In this example, the locator 36 is provided in the form of at least two
locator tabs 37a and 37b receivable by the at least partially open end 22. The at least
two locator tabs 36 are arranged to fit with or within opposing inner surfaces 38 of the
section member 12. A third locator tab 36c may also be provided, as required. The at
least two locator tabs 37a and 37b may snuggly fit with the opposing inner surfaces 38
of the section member 12 to secure the support 20 thereto with the ends 40 of the
opposing sides 25 bearing on a top surface 42 of the support 20. The tabs 37 extend
substantially perpendicularly from opposing side edges 44 of the flat body 29 of the
first portion 20.
[0040] The upturned or second portion 24 extends substantially perpendicularly
upwardly from the coupled end 32 of the first portion 20 such that in side profile the
support 18 is substantially L-shaped. The upturned or second portion 24 includes a
relatively flat body 46 that fits within and is substantially received by the lengthwise
channel 26. The depths of the lengthwise channel 26 is such that the second portion
24 is substantially received thereby so as to be at least one of substantially flush with
and recessed within the channel 26, thereby allowing fasteners to be passed through
the respective apertures 28 with any heads of the fasteners also being recessed or flush
within the channel 26. It is noted that in use the channel 26 is typically fitted against a
side frame or surface, and as such the fasteners are captured between the side frame or
surface and the section member 12 thereby being substantially inaccessible and

                                           -7
improving safety as well as aesthetics.
[0041] The base 16 includes apertures 48 that are arranged to receive one or more
fasteners (not shown) to secure the base 16 to the supporting surface. The apertures 16
are substantially covered by the support 18 in the closed condition. It is noted that, in
this example, the base 16 is wider than the support 18 and is about the same length.
[0042] The base 16 and the support 18 may be formed as separate parts that are
machined, pressed, and/or drilled to shape. Preferably, the support 18 may be folded
or pressed to shape in which the locator tabs 36 are folded upwardly relative to the flat
body 29 of the support 18 and the upturned or second portion 24 is folded upwardly to
be perpendicular to the coupled end 32 of the first portion 20. Notches 49 may be
made in the side edges 44 of the first portion 20 to allow the tabs 37 to be folded. The
base 16 and the support 18 may be substantially formed from metal or other suitable
material.
[0043] The hinge 10 may be provided as a stand-alone part or may be provided as a
kit or an assembly 100 including one or more of the section member 12 and one or
more of the hinges 10.
[0044] In use, a method of coupling the section member 12 to a supporting surface
(not shown) using the pivot hinge 10 may include:     fitting the support 18 of the pivot
hinge 10 to an at least partially open end 22 of the section member 12 with a seating
or locating portion 20 of the support 18 locating the open end 22 and the upturned or
second portion 24 of the support 18 being received by and extending lengthwise along
the channel 26 on the side 25 of the section member 12 extending away from the open
end 22; coupling the upturned or second portion 24 to the channel 26 using one or
more fasteners; and coupling the base 16 to the support surface using one or more
fasteners.
[0045] Advantageously, there has been described a pivot hinge and a section member
that fit with one another such that fasteners between the pivot hinge and the section
member are substantially concealed in use. In particular, the support of the hinge is
able to locate with a substantially open end of the section member and an angled or

                                           -8
upturned section thereof is substantially received by and extends along a channel of
the section member so as to allow the recessing of the fasteners and allowing the
channel side of the section member to be located closely to a frame or other fixed
surface thereby concealing the fasteners in at least the closed condition thereby
providing security and aesthetic advantages.
