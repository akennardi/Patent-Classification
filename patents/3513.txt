   Technical Field
                The present disclosure relates to thermoplastic products. In particular, the
   present invention relates to systems and methods for providing a thermoplastic
10 product that includes packaging therefor, wherein the packaging is used to contain
   one or more ingredients            of the thermoplastic product during storage and/or
   transportation, and wherein the packaging itself is an ingredient for inclusion into the
   thermoplastic product.
   Background and Related Art
15              While techniques     currently exist relating to pavement joint sealants,
   pavement crack sealants, waterproofing membranes, hot melt adhesives, roofing
   asphalt, paving grade asphalt cement, challenges exist.
                Upon manufacturing      pavement joint or crack       sealants, waterproofing
   membranes, or hot melt adhesives, the sealants, membranes or adhesives are
20 typically pumped or poured into plastic bag lined cardboard boxes at temperatures
   lower than the melting point of the plastic bag liners, then are stacked on pallets for
   cooling, storage and shipment. When the sealants, membranes, or adhesives are
   applied, they may be used to minimize water infiltration, prevent the accumulation of
   debris, and prolong the life of a material or structure. Examples of such materials
25 include asphalt pavement and portland cement pavement. Examples of such
   structures include roads, roofs, bridge decks, retention ponds, etc. Application of the
   sealants, waterproofing membranes, or hot melt adhesives typically requires heating
   and mixing at application temperatures.
                Challenges exist in using plastic bag lined cardboard boxes for products, such
30 as packaging sealants, waterproofing membranes,               or hot melt adhesives. For
   example, prior to application of the products, if the cardboard boxes are exposed to
   water, the structural integrity of the cardboard boxes is compromised. When the
   integrity of the box is compromised, the plastic bag liner can also become
   compromised. Moreover, the product can escape from the storage boxes and become
35 unusable, which may not only become a waste of the product but also an unsightly
   9931757_1 (GHMatters)P79394.AU.3

                                                 2
   pile at the storage or job site. In addition, whenever the product sticks to another
   material, including the storage container, it can require a very time consuming and
   arduous task to eliminate the foreign material from the product and can even cause
   the product to become unusable.
 5             Challenges also exist in the roofing asphalt industry. Upon manufacturing
   roofing asphalt, the roofing asphalt is typically poured into silicone coated paper
   containers or roofing plugs at high temperatures and allowed to solidify when
   cooled. The filled roofing plugs are typically about 100 pounds each, and can prove
   difficult and potentially hazardous to handle. In order to use the roofing plug, the
10 paper packaging needs to be peeled from the plug, leaving a large and unwieldy
   piece of roofing plug, which is difficult to handle and can cause injury to operators.
   There is also a risk of dropping or mishandling the roofing plug when placing it into
   the roofing asphalt melter, causing hot asphalt to splash onto the operator, causing
   serious burns. Challenges exist in shipping this type of container in warm weather
15 conditions, as the paper containers can become compromised when exposed to water.
   The roofing asphalt softens in summer weather and can flow or otherwise escape
   from the compromised containers, which may not only become a waste of the
   roofing asphalt but also an unsightly pile at the storage or job site. In addition,
   whenever the roofing asphalt sticks to another material, it can require a very time
20 consuming and arduous task to eliminate the foreign material from the roofing
   asphalt and can even cause the roofing asphalt to become unusable.
               Challenges also exist relating to paving grade asphalt cement.    In some
   markets, paving grade asphalt cement is shipped in metal containers, such as 55
   gallon metal drums. The metal drums pose an environmental challenge to customers
25 because they cannot be economically returned to the manufacturer, nor can they be
   easily recycled or reused in remote areas because they are contaminated with asphalt
   and/or the recycling facilities are not within economical shipping distance.
               Thus, while techniques currently exist relating to pavement joint sealants,
   pavement crack sealants, waterproofing membranes, hot melt adhesives, roofing
30 asphalt, paving grade asphalt cement, challenges exist. Accordingly, it would be an
   improvement in the art to augment or even replace current techniques with other
   teclmiques.

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
               The present disclosure relates to thermoplastic products. In particular, the
   present description relates to systems and methods for providing a thermoplastic
   product that includes packaging therefor. Embodiments of take place in association
 5 with packaging one or more ingredients of a thermoplastic product, wherein the
   packaging is used to contain the ingredients during storage and/or transportation, and
   wherein at least a portion of the packaging itself is an ingredient for inclusion into
   the thermoplastic product. In some implementations, the entire packaging is
   incorporated into the thermoplastic product for utilization thereof.
10             The packaging may be created using an expanded, formed, molded, injected,
   injection molded, foam injection molded, expanded bead injection molded, welded,
   compression molded, but out and/or other process. In one embodiment, the container

15 the disclosure and in the claims the term "thermoplastic product" shall include one or
   more polymeric materials that are solid or semisolid at ambient temperatures and that
   soften and/or melt when heated. At least some thermoplastic products can be
   reformed repeatedly without significant change in composition or properties.
               With reference now to Figure 1, a representative embodiment is illustrated
20 that includes one or more ingredients for a thermoplastic product included in a
   container for storage and/or transportation, and wherein the container itself is an
   ingredient for inclusion into the thermoplastic product. The ingredients in the
   container can be a homogenous product, a heterogeneous mixture, or specifically
   measured ingredients that are used along with the container to create a thermoplastic
25 product when combined with the container at, for example, elevated temperatures.
               In Figure 1, a representative thermoplastic ingredient container is illustrated
   as durable container 10 having a base 12 and lid 14. Base 12 is configured to receive
   a volume of one or more thermoplastic product ingredients 16. The combination of
   base 12 and lid 14 protects ingredients 16 from contaminates and the weather. In the
30 illustrated embodiment, portion 18 of lid 14 couples to or otherwise extends into
   ingredients 16 to maintain lid 14 coupled to base 12.
               Accordingly, container 10 is configured to contain a volume of thermoplastic
   product ingredients and comprises a polymer or other material that is pre-calculated

                Examples            of polymer  materials include    polystyrene,  polypropylene,
   polyethylene, ethylene vinyl acetate, styrene butadiene styrene block copolymers,
   styrene butadiene rubber or another polymer material. In one embodiment, the
   packaging is a polymer container, such as a plastic or plastic foam container, which
 5 is itself thermoplastic.
                In some embodiments, the thermoplastic product ingredient packaging
   comprises inter-receiving and/or interlocking containers that increase stability when
   stacked. For example, the                 embodiment   illustrated  in Figure   1 provides   a
   representative              container 10 that is configured    to be interlocking with other
10 corresponding containers. In particular, top surface of lid 14 includes one or more
   receiving portions 19 that are configured to receive corresponding protrusions
   located at a bottom surface of a base of a similar container. In at least some
   embodiments, the container insulates the ingredients in the container.

   Accordingly, embodiments embrace a variety of materials, shapes, configurations
   and/or sizes for providing a thermoplastic product that includes packaging therefor,
   wherein the packaging is used to contain thermoplastic product ingredients during
   storage and/or transportation, at least a portion of the packaging being incorporated
20 into the thermoplastic product for utilization thereof. In the illustrated embodiment,
   the packaging (illustrated as container 10) contributes to the structural stability of an
   individual container and a pallet or partial pallet, as will be further discussed below.
                In some embodiments, the container is weather proof, resistant to ozone
   and/or other free radicals in the atmosphere, resistant to ultra violet light from the
25 sun, compatible with the thermoplastic product, and/or able to undergo a process of
   being mixed at application temperature into the thermoplastic product. Furthermore,
   the container resists cracking and/or melting at storage temperatures, resists cracking
   and/or melting at packaging temperatures,                  is strong enough to contain the
   thermoplastic product ingredients., and/or is able to maintain structural soundness
30 during storage and transportation.
                With reference now to Figures 2, a perspective top view of another
   representative container lid in accordance with an embodiment is illustrated. In
   Figure 2, lid 20 includes one or more protrusions 22 that are configured to be
   received by one or more corresponding receiving portions of a bottom surface of a
   9931757_1 (GHMatters)P79394.AU.3

                                                     11

   lid 20 includes a label or marking 24 and handles 26.
                With reference to Figure 3, a bottom perspective view is provided of lid 20.
                At least some embodiments include one or more vents that allow heat to
 5 dissipate. In the illustrated embodiment, channel 32 is created between structures 30
   and 34 to enable the dissipation of heat at channel 32. Additionally, in the illustrated
   embodiment, handle 26 (Figure 2) includes surface 36, which also enables the
   dissipation of heat.
                In Figure 4, a perspective top view of a representative container 40 is
10 illustrated, wherein container 40 includes surface 42, which corresponds to surface
   36 (Figure 3) to enable the dissipation of heat. Additionally, lip 44 is configured to
   receive lid 20, and enables heat to dissipate.
                As provided above, Figure 5 illustrates a perspective bottom view of a
   representative container 40 that includes receiving portions 50, which are configured
15 to selectively receive corresponding protrusions of a container lit to enable the
   containers to interlock.
                While the containers illustrated in Figures 1-5 illustrate containers that
   interlock at their top and bottom surfaces, those skilled in the art will appreciate that

20              With reference now to Figure 6, a representative method for obtaining a
   thermoplastic product for use is provided in accordance with an embodiment. In
   Figure 6, execution begins at step 60, wherein a container is provided that is
   configured to receive one or more ingredients for a thermoplastic product. At
   decision block 62, a determination is made as to whether or not the ingredients to be
25 placed into the container are to be pre-mixed. In some embodiments, a pre-mixing
   process occurs in advance of placing the ingredients into the container. In one
   embodiment,                the pre-mixing process  includes heating and mixing various
   ingredients.
                If it is determined at decision block 62 that ingredients are to be pre-mixed,
30 execution proceeds to step 64, where the pre-mixing takes place. The pre-mixed
   ingredients are then placed into the container at step 66. Alternatively, if it is
   determined at decision block 62 that the ingredients are not to be pre-mixed,
   execution proceeds directly to step 66.
                At step 66, one or more ingredients for a thermoplastic product are placed
35 into a container. The containers are then used to store and transport the ingredients.

   At a mixing site, such as at a job or other site, one or more containers with the
   ingredients therein are mixed together at step 70 to obtain a thermoplastic product. In
   at least some embodiments, the process for mixing includes providing heat to mix the
   ingredients, including at least a portion of the containers. In at least some
 5 embodiments, the entire containers are included in the mixing process to obtain the
   thermoplastic product. At step 72, the thermoplastic product is then applied for use.
                Accordingly, the applied thermoplastic product includes at least a portion of
   the container and/or packaging that was used to store and/or transport thermoplastic
   product ingredients prior to application of the combined mixture onto a surface.
10              Application of the thermoplastic product to a surface includes providing a
   thermoplastic product container having a volume of thermoplastic product; heating
   and mixing the thermoplastic product ingredient container and the volume of
   thermoplastic product ingredients to produce a volume of a thermoplastic product
   mixture; and applying the thermoplastic product mixture to the surface.
15              In another representative embodiment for applying a thermoplastic product to
   a surface, the various raw materials are obtained and then combined. By way of
   example, the raw materials are weighed and then transferred into a mixing tank. The
   materials are then heated to the appropriate temperature for mixing (e.g., 3000 F
   430oF or another temperature). The ingredient mixture is then cooled to a packaging
20 temperature (e.g., 2000- 2150 F or another temperature).

   comprised in the container.
               The ingredient mixture is then transferred into packaging containers, such as
   the sealant packaging or containers discussed herein. By way of example, the process
 5 of transferring can include: (i) pumping the ingredient mixture through a colloid mill
   to a mix tank and/or packaging tank; (ii) adding measured amounts of ground talc,
   ground tire rubber, and ground sodium bentonite to the mixture coming from the mix
   tank; (iii) allowing the packaging tank to agitate; (iv) adding a measured amount of
   ground limestone while agitating; and (v) packaging the resulting mixture. The
10 packaged mixture may be cooled to a packaging temperature (e.g., 180 F -250 F or
   another temperature) or an ambient temperature. The containers are then stacked and
   transported, such as to a job site. The packaged ingredients and corresponding
   sealant container(s) are combined to form a thermoplastic product. In at least some
   embodiments, the combination of the mixture and container includes melting the
15 mixture and/or packaging, and creating the thermoplastic product, which is applied

   and hot melt adhesives, as well as sealants which contain fiber and aggregate or no
   asphalt at all.
                In some embodiments, the packaging comprises a durable container that is
   configured to receive a volume of one or more ingredients. The durable container is
10 used to hold the one or more ingredients during storage and/or transportation, and
   contributes to the structural stability of an individual container and a stack of
   containers (i.e., a pallet or partial pallet of containers). In further implementations,
   the durable container is interlocking with other durable containers, which further
   contributes to the structural stability of a stack of containers.
15              In some embodiments, the durable container is a thermoplastic or is capable
   of becoming part of a thermoplastic product. It can be molded, formed, or created
   through a process to be any shape or size, to be conducive for the packaging product
   or specific application requirements or equipment needs. The container is durable
   and structural by itself and/or as part of a larger combination of other containers that
20 are stacked on a pallet or in another shipping method. In some embodiments, the
   container remains rigid and is not structurally compromised at any ambient
   temperature where the container would be shipped or stored. In some embodiments,
   expanded polystyrene polymer or any other expanded polymer is used. In one
   embodiment, linerar low density polyethylene plastic buckets or low density
25 polyethylene plastic buckets are used as the containers.
                In some embodiments, the durable container is weight-bearing. Further, at
   least some containers comprise a polymer or other material that is pre-calculated to
   be used as an ingredient in the thermoplastic product mixture or material. Examples
   of such polymer materials include polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene,
30 ethylene vinyl acetate, styrene butadiene styrene block copolymer, styrene butadiene
   rubber or another polymer material. In some implementations,. the durable container
   comprises a plastic or plastic foam container which can be thermoplastic itself. In

    some embodiments, the durable container is solid or semi-solid at ambient
   temperatures, and is heated and mixed with other ingredients to create the
   thermoplastic product.
               Accordingly, at the job site, one or more containers with ingredients therein
 5 may be combined to obtain a thermoplastic product for application onto one or more
    surfaces. Therefore, the applied thermoplastic product includes the container that was
   used to store and/or transport the ingredients prior to mixture of the thermoplastic
   product.
               In some embodiments, generation of a thermoplastic product for application
10 to a surface includes providing a thermoplastic product ingredient container having a
   volume of thermoplastic product ingredients; mixing the thermoplastic product
   ingredient container and the volume of thermoplastic product ingredients to produce
   a volume of a thermoplastic product; and applying the thermoplastic product mixture
   to the surface. In at least some implementations, the mixing of the thermoplastic
15 product ingredient container and the volume of thermoplastic product ingredients to
   produce a volume of a thermoplastic product comprises heating the mixture. In one
   implementation, the mixture is heated to about 2500 to 4500 F. However, other
   embodiments embrace other temperature ranges.
               While the methods and processes of the present invention have proven to be
20 particularly useful in the area of pavement crack sealants, joint sealants, other
    sealants, waterproofing membranes, roofing asphalt, paving grade asphalt cement,
   and hot melt adhesives, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the methods and
   processes can be used in a variety of different applications and in a variety of
   different areas of manufacture to yield a thermoplastic product for application to a
25  surface, wherein the thermoplastic product includes its storage and/or transportation
   container as an ingredient thereof when applied to a surface. Examples include
   pavement maintenance (e.g., asphalt crack sealants, concrete joint sealants, bridge
   deck membranes, bridge expansion joint sealants, wide crack sealants, pothole
   patching products, concrete spall repair products, concrete patching products, paving
30 joint adhesives, traffic loop detector sealants, pavement marker adhesives, colored

                Embodiments embrace a container that protects the ingredients contained
   therein from the weather and from water, and is less likely to leak and spill. The
10 container does not require removal as it is just included into the melter/applicator
   when creating the thermoplastic product. The container allows the ingredients to be
   packaged in any convenient shape or size for any particular purpose.
                Thus, as discussed herein, the embodiments embrace thermoplastic products.
   In particular, embodiments relate to systems and methods for providing a
15 thermoplastic product that includes packaging therefor, wherein the packaging is
   used to contain one or more ingredients of the thermoplastic product during storage
   and/or transportation, and wherein the packaging itself is an ingredient for inclusion
   into the thermoplastic product.
                The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without
20 departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are
   to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of
   the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the
   foregoing description.           All changes that come within the meaning and range of
   equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.
25              It is to be understood that, if any prior art publication is referred to herein,
   such reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part of
   the common general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country.
                In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the invention,
   except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
30 implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising"
   is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not
   to preclude the presence or addition of further features in various embodiments of the
   invention.
