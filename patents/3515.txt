                                                          BACKGROUND
[0001]                 Geophysical                surveying is   a technique where     three-dimensional
geophysical "pictures" of the state of an underground formation are taken with the use
of energy (e.g., acoustic, electromagnetic, etc.) that penetrates the underground
formation. Geophysical surveying takes place not only on land, but also in marine
environments. Marine-based geophysical surveying faces significant challenges that
are not faced by land-based surveying systems.

                                               NOTATION AND NOMENCLATURE
[0013]                 Certain terms are used throughout the following description and claims to
refer to particular system components.                             As one skilled in the art will appreciate,
different companies may refer to a component by different names. This document
does not intend to distinguish between components that differ in name but not
function.
[0014]                 In the following discussion and in the claims, the terms "including" and
"comprising" are used in an open-ended fashion, and thus should be interpreted to
mean "including, but not limited to... ." Also, the term "couple" or "couples" is
intended to mean either an indirect or direct connection. Thus, if a first device
couples to a second device, that connection may be through a direct connection or
through an indirect connection via other devices and connections.
[0015]                 "Releasably coupled" shall mean that a first device mechanically couples to
a second device in such a way that the first device can be mechanically detached
from the second device without damage to or disassembly of either device or
intermediate devices.                             Devices coupled such that detachment requires cutting,
breaking, deforming, damaging, or disassembly shall not be considered to be
releasably coupled.

                                                                  -4
[0016]                 "Marine environment" shall mean an underwater location regardless of the
salinity of the water. Thus, even an underwater location in a body of fresh water shall
be considered a marine environment.
[0017]                 "Sea floor" shall mean the boundary of a body of water and the underlying
sediment or rock. The term sea floor shall not imply anything regarding the salinity of
the water, and thus even the boundary of a body of fresh water and the underlying
sediment or rock shall be considered a sea floor.
[0018]                 "On the sea floor" shall mean either in direct contact with, or no more than
about 50 feet above the sea floor.
[0019]                  "Surface" in relation to the top of a body of water shall mean any location
100 feet below mean sea level and above.
                                                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0020]                 The following discussion is directed to various embodiments of the
invention.              Although one or more of these embodiments may be preferred, the
embodiments disclosed should not be interpreted, or otherwise used, as limiting the
scope of the disclosure or the claims.                               In addition, one skilled in the art will
understand that the following description has broad application, and the discussion of
any embodiment is meant only to be exemplary of that embodiment, and not intended
to intimate that the scope of the disclosure or the claims is limited to that embodiment.
[0021]                 Various example systems and methods are directed to geophysical
surveying in marine environments where the sensors used for the geophysical
surveying                 (e.g.,          geophones,           hydrophones,    accelerometers,    electrodes,
magnetometers) are stationary and are placed on or near the sea floor. More
particularly still, at least some of the various embodiments are systems where a
distance between sensors along a sensor cable can be selected prior to deployment.
The specification first turns to illustrative systems to orient the reader, and then to
specifics regarding installation and use of the example systems.
[0022]                 Figure 1 shows a perspective cut-away view of a portion of a marine
environment showing deployment of sensors for a marine-based geophysical survey.
In particular, Figure 1 shows the surface 100 of the water. At a distance D below the
surface 100 resides the sea floor 102, and below the sea floor 102 resides a

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                         -5
subsurface formation of interest, illustratively a hydrocarbon reservoir 104. In some
locations the precise depth of the sea floor 102 is easily discernible, such as in
locations where the sea floor is defined by a rock layer. In other locations, the sea
floor 102 may be defined by a layer of silt, sand, mud, and/or organic material that
has increasing density with increase depth, starting from a density approximately the
same as the surrounding water. Thus, the precise depth where the sea floor 102
begins may be harder to quantify in some cases.
[0023]                 Within the example environment of Figure 1 resides a stationary
vessel 106, illustratively shown as a boat. The example stationary vessel 106 may
remain in place based on one or more anchors (not specifically shown), or the
stationary vessel 106 may be dynamically positioned to remain at a particular
location. Communicatively coupled to a computer system on the stationary vessel
106 is a sensor cable 108 that extends from the stationary vessel 106 to the sea floor
102. In other example system, the stationary vessel may be a buoy coupled to the
sensor cable 108, and also communicatively coupled to land-based computer (e.g.,
communicatively coupled by satellite or point-to-point wireless transmission). The
sensor cable 108 comprises a plurality of sensor modules (e.g., sensor modules 110)
that are associated with the sensors appropriate for the geophysical survey, such as
hydrophones, geophones, accelerometers, electrodes, and/or magnetometers.
[0024]                 In order to place the sensor cable 108 (and sensor modules 110) on the
sea floor 102, a work vessel 112 may hold the sensor cable on a deployment device
114, illustratively shown as a reel structure around which the sensor cable 108 may
be spooled. The work vessel 112 may sail away from the stationary vessel 106 while
simultaneously feeding the sensor cable 108 off the deployment device 114, with the
sensor cable 108 ultimately coming to rest on the sea floor. The example system of
Figure 1 shows sensor cable 108 extending in a straight line away from the stationary
vessel 106, but such is merely an example, the work vessel 112 may lay the sensor
cable in any suitable pattern relative to the location of the stationary vessel 106. By
precise measurement of the location and speed of the work vessel, and knowledge of
the distance between the sensor modules and the depth of the water, the location of
each sensor module may be accurately determined.                     In yet still other example

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                         -6
systems, the sensor cable 108 may be deployed by a remotely operated vehicle
(ROV) or an autonomously operated vehicle (AOV) which deploys the sensor cable
108, and communicates with the various sensor modules 110.
[0025]                 Regardless of the precise deployment mechanism, once the sensor cable
108 (and in some cases other sensor cables not specifically shown) has been
deployed to the sea floor 102, a geophysical survey may take place by release of
energy (e.g., by way of an air gun, vibrator, antenna, or magnetic coil) within the
water. Measurement of signals that return to the sensor modules after reflection from
one or more features below the sea floor are recorded by the sensor modules 110,
such as reflections of the acoustic or electromagnetic energy from the hydrocarbon
bearing reservoir 104. After the geophysical survey is complete, the example sensor
cable 108 may be retrieved, either by the work vessel 114 or by the stationary vessel
106. The system of Figure 1 is merely an example to orient the reader. Many
variations regarding deployment of one or more sensor cables to the sea floor are
possible, and thus the example system of Figure 1 should not be read to restrict
possible deployment scenarios to just the example system shown.
[0026]                 There are a host of parameters associated with geophysical surveys that
may be selected and/or adjusted for any particular situation.                 For example, the
physical location at which the energy is released may be selected to achieve
particular goals for the geophysical survey. The strength of the energy release may
be adjusted (e.g., the strength of the energy release may be adjusted as a function of
depth of the hydrocarbon bearing formation 104 beneath the sea floor 102). The
pattern of the sensor cable 108 along the sea floor 102 may be selected to meet
particular needs of the survey (e.g., expansive pattern for exploratory surveys, and a
dense pattern for determining particular properties about a known hydrocarbon
reservoir). Further still, the spacing "S" between the sensor modules may be selected
to achieve certain goals (e.g., surveys of shallow hydrocarbon reservoirs may use
close spacing, while surveys of deep hydrocarbon reservoirs may use extended
spacing).
[0027]                 In the related-art, the spacing between sensor modules is controlled by the
sensor cable. That is, in the related-art the overall sensor cable is divided into a

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                                   -7
plurality of sensor cable portions, where each sensor cable portion has a connector
on each end. A connector is an electrical and/or optical coupling device configured
for use in marine environments. An overall sensor cable is constructed by coupling
sensor modules in series between sensor cable portions by way of the connectors.
Thus, the overall sensor cable may be constructed one piece at a time, with the
spacing between modules dictated by the lengths of the sensor cable portions.
[0028]                 The related-art sensor cables have limitations and/or shortcomings. If a
different spacing between sensor modules is desired, a completely different sensor
cable (having shorter or longer sensor cable portion lengths) is used. Moreover, each
connector represents a discontinuity in the outer jacket of the sensor cable where
water encroachment and mechanical failure are more likely to occur. Moreover, by
connecting sensor modules and sensor cable portions in series, the sensor modules
themselves may carry mechanical load (i.e., tension) during deployment and retrieval.
[0029]                 The problems noted above are addressed, at least in part, by a system
where sensor modules may be coupled to a sensor cable at any location along an
extended axial length of the sensor cable without requiring discontinuities in the outer
jacket of the sensor cable. That is, the sensor modules couple to the sensor cable
without using connectors.                                Figure 2 shows a perspective view of a portion of a
geophysical system 200 in accordance with at least some embodiments.                                       In
particular, Figure 2 shows a sensor cable 108, as well as two sensor modules 204
and 206. Sensor module 204 is shown fully coupled to the sensor cable 108, while
sensor module 206 is shown partially coupled to the senor cable 108 to show an
example system.
[0030]                 The sensor cable 108 comprises an elongated outer jacket 208. The
example outer jacket 208 may take any suitable form. In one example system, the
elongated outer jacket 208 is flexible and constructed of polyurethane, but other
water-tight polymeric and non-magnetic substances may also be used. The outer
jacket 208 defines a central axis 210 along the long dimension of the outer jacket. In
some example systems the sensor cable 108 may be several kilometers in length,
and thus the outer jacket 208 may have a similar length. The outer jacket 208 defines
an interior volume 212. Within the interior volume 212 resides one more electrical

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                         -8
conductor, and example systems may comprise two electrical conductors 214 and
216. As illustrated, the electrical conductors may be disposed on opposite sides of the
interior volume 212, but such placement is not strictly required. Other devices and/or
components may likewise reside within the interior volume (e.g., strength members)
as well as devices to enable the relative placement of the electrical conductors 214
and 216, but the additional devices are not shown in Figure 2 so as not to unduly
complicate the figure. The outer jacket also defines an outside diameter (OD), and
where the outside diameter is uniform not only at the locations where the example
sensor modules 204 and 206 are coupled, but also between the sensor modules and
beyond.
[0031]                 In addition to the electrical conductors 214 and 216 (and possibly strength
members), the interior volume 212 may be filled with a substantially non-compressible
substance such that the sensor cable 108 retains its shape at depth within the marine
environment. In example systems the interior volume 212 may be filled with a water
or petroleum-based liquid, or a water- or petroleum based gel. Inasmuch as the
sensor cable is to be deployed on the sea floor, the sensor cable 108 may be
negatively buoyant, and the substance within the interior volume 212 may thus be
selected to achieve particular buoyancy.
[0032]                 Still referring to Figure 2, sensor module 204 is shown coupled to the
sensor cable 108, and in particular coupled such that the sensor module 204 abuts
and circumscribes the outer jacket 208. The example sensor module 204 comprises
a base portion 220 and a lid portion 222. In some cases, the lid portion 222 may
couple to the base portion by a hinge (not visible in Figure 2) on one side, and may
couple to the base portion 220 by way of a latch 224 disposed opposite the hinge. It is
within the base portion 220 that various devices reside, such as the sensor and a
control circuit coupled to the sensor (discussed more below).
[0033]                 The sensor module 206 may be of similar design and construction as
sensor module 204. In the view of Figure 2, however, sensor module 206 is shown in
a configuration where the base portion 226 abuts the outer jacket 208, but where the
lid portion 228 is in an open configuration. Mechanically coupling a sensor module
(such as sensor module 206) may thus involve opening the lid portion 228 with

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                         -9
respect to the base portion 226. While in the open configuration the base portion 226
(or, alternatively, the lid portion 228) may be placed in an abutting relationship with
the outer jacket 208. Once the sensor module is at the desired axial location, the lid
portion 228 may be closed and the latch 230 latched to the base portion 226. It is
noted that while latch 230 is shown coupled to the lid portion, the latch 230 may also
couple to the base portion, or the latch may comprises multiple components
distributed among the lid portion 228 and the base portion 226. Furthermore, multiple
latches may be used.
[0034]                 In accordance with example systems, a sensor module may be placed at
substantially any location along the senor cable 108. In the section of the sensor
cable shown in Figure 2, for example, the sensor modules may be placed at any
location, and thus the spacing S may be set or adjusted for any particular geophysical
survey without the need to obtain a different sensor cable 108. Moreover, the outer
jacket 208 may be continuous for long distances in axial length (stated otherwise, a
plurality of sensor modules may be placed over a continuous length of outer jacket),
thus eliminating the need for connectors. Moreover, to the extent axial forces are
carried along the sensor cable 108 (e.g., during deployment, during retrieval), the
axial forces are not carried by the sensor modules, which may make the design and
construction of the sensor modules cheaper and less expensive than sensor modules
that must carry axial load imposed upon the sensor cable.
[0035]                 Figure 3 shows a side elevation view of two separate sensor modules in
accordance with further example systems. In particular, the left sensor module 300
comprises a base portion 302 and the lid portion 304, where the lid portion 304 is
shown coupled to the base portion 302 by way of a hinge 303. In some situations,
the base portion 302 and lid portion 304 may be referred to as a coupling member.
The lid portion 304 and base portion 302 define a passage 306 through the sensor
module, where the passage 306 defines an inside diameter configured to abut and
circumscribe the outside diameter of a sensor cable (not shown in Figure 3). The
base portion 302 and lid portion 304 may be constructed of any suitable material,
such as plastic material, metallic materials, and combinations. In accordance with
example systems, the base portion 302 defines an interior volume 308 (shown in

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                         -10
partial cutaway) within which various electrical components may reside, the electrical
components discussed more below.
[0036]                 The right sensor module 310 of the Figure 3 shows that, in other example
systems, rather than the lid portion 312 being hinged to the base portion 314, the lid
portion may be fully separable from the base portion 314. In these example systems,
latches 316 and 318 on opposite sides of the lid portion 312, on opposite sides of the
base portion 314, or both, may be used to couple the sensor module to the sensor
cable at the desired axial location along the sensor cable 108.
[0037]                 The specification now turns to a discussion of the communicative coupling
between the sensor modules (e.g., 110, 204, 206, 300, 310) and the electrical
conductors (e.g., 214, 216) within the sensor cable 108. In the various example
systems, the sensor modules may be placed at substantially any location along the
sensor cable 108, and as described the outer jacket 208 may be continuous in the
regions where the sensor modules connect. Thus, in the example systems control
circuits and sensors within the sensor modules are electrically isolated from the
electrical conductors disposed within the outer jacket 208 of the sensor cable 108.
Nevertheless, the control circuits are communicatively coupled to one or more of the
electrical conductors. More particularly, in example systems, each control circuit
within each sensor module may be inductively coupled to the one or more of the
electrical conductors 214 and 216 within the outer jacket 208 such that the control
circuit can receive communications from a computer system controlling the
geophysical survey.
[0038]                 Figure 4 shows an electrical block diagram of an example system
comprising a sensor module communicatively coupled to a sensor cable.                          In
particular, Figure 4 shows system 400 comprising a surface computer 402
communicatively coupled to the electrical conductors 214 and 216 of a sensor cable
108. In spite of the fact Figure 4 is an electrical block diagram, in order to convey
certain concepts the outer jacket 208 of the sensor cable 208 is shown in dashed
lines. Thus, the electrical conductors 214 and 216 reside within the outer jacket 208,
and are electrically coupled to the surface computer 402.                   Figure 4 also shows
various components associated with an example sensor module. In particular, Figure

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\ h36803_ II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                          - 11
4 shows a control circuit 404 coupled to sensor 406. The sensor 406 is one or more
sensors suitable for use in geophysical surveying. In one example system the sensor
406 is a hydrophone, which senses acoustic energy incident upon the sensor. In
another example system the sensor 406 is a geophone, which senses movement
(displacement) associated with acoustic energy incident upon the sensor. In yet still
further example systems, the sensor 406 may be one or more accelerometers (e.g., a
three-axis accelerometer), which sensor(s) sense acceleration associated with
acoustic energy incident upon the sensor(s). In other example systems, the sensor
406 may be an electrode or magnetometer, which senses electromagnetic field
amplitude and/or phase incident upon the sensor.                      In yet still other cases, a
combination of two or more different types of sensors may be included in the sensors
406.
[0039]                 The one or more sensors 406 are communicatively coupled to the control
circuit 404. In the example systems, the control circuit 404, upon command from the
surface computer 402, reads data created by the sensor 406 and stores the data for
later download. The control circuit 404 may also cease data collection upon the
command of the surface computer 402, and further the control circuit may send
portions or all the data to the surface computer over the sensor cable 108.                   For
example, the control circuit 404 (discussed in greater detail below) may store the data
collected by sensor 406 for download to the surface computer 402 (or some other
computer system) once the sensor module within which the control circuit 404 is
disposed has been retrieved to the surface. However, small portions of the data
(sometimes referred to quality control (QC) data) may be sent to the surface computer
402 by the control circuit 404 during periods of time when the sensor module is
located on the sea floor.
[0040]                 In the various example systems, the control circuit 404 communicates with
the surface computer 402 over the one or more electrical conductors disposed within
the sensor cable 108. More particularly, in the example systems the control circuit
404 and the computer system 402 are communicatively coupled in spite of the fact
that the control circuit 404 is electrically isolated from the electrical conductors 214
and 216 by at least the outer jacket 208, the outer cover of the base portion, and in

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                          -12
many cases insulation covering the electrical conductors 214 and 216 themselves. In
the system of Figure 4, the control circuit is coupled to an electrical conductor 410
that is located within the base portion of the sensor module, and arranged in such a
way that the electrical conductor runs parallel to the at least one of the electrical
conductors. As illustrated, in some cases the electrical conductor is arranged to
extend parallel both to the electrical conductor 214 and the electrical conductor 216.
The communicative coupling in the example systems is an inductive coupling system.
[0041]                 Inductive coupling is based, at least in part, on magnetic fields that
surround a conductor in the presence of electrical current flow along the conductor.
In particular, considering traditional electrical current flow (i.e., hole flow, with actual
electron flow in the opposite direction), a magnetic field is created around an electrical
conductor as characterized by the "right hand rule" (where the thumb indicates the
direction of current flow, and the finger movement from an open-hand position to a
closed-hand represented the direction of the magnetic field). Thus, electrical current
flow along the conductor 410 in the direction indicated by arrow 412 produces a
magnetic field. The magnetic field produced by the electrical current flow extends
outward from the conductor 410.                          In the various embodiments, the electrical
conductor 410 is positioned within sensor module such that the conductor is
physically close (e.g., within 5 centimeters (cm), and in some cases within 2 cm) to an
electrical conductor within the sensor cable 108. The proximity of the electrical
conductor 410 to an electrical conductor within the sensor cable 108 enables the
magnetic field created responsive to current flow in the conductor 410 to at least
partially encompass the portion of the electrical conductor within the sensor cable 108
parallel to the conductor 410. In the example system of Figure 4, portion 414 of
electrical conductor 216 is parallel to the corresponding portion of electrical conductor
410, and thus the magnetic field created by electrical current flow in conductor 410 at
least partially encompasses the portion 414 of electrical conductor 216.
[0042]                 A second aspect of the inductive coupling may comprise the phenomenon
that an electrical current can be induced in an electrical conductor when the electrical
conductor is exposed to a time varying magnetic field. Thus, in accordance with the
example systems, communicative coupling from the control circuit 404 to the surface

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                         -13
computer 402 may take place by a creation of time varying electrical current flow in
the electrical conductor 410. The time varying electrical current flow thus creates a
time varying magnetic field around the conductor, and because the portion 414 of the
electrical conductor 216 is exposed to the time varying magnetic field, electrical
currents are induced in the electrical conductor 216 proportional to the current flow in
the conductor 410. The opposite is also true. That is, communicative coupling from
the surface computer 402 to the control circuit 404 may take place by a creation of
time varying electrical current flow in the electrical conductor 216 creating a time
varying magnetic field around the conductor. Because the electrical conductor 410 is
exposed to the time varying magnetic field, electrical currents are induced in the
electrical conductor 410 proportional to the current flow in the conductor 216. Thus,
two-way data communication may take place between the surface computer 402 and
the control circuit 404 in spite of the fact that the control circuit 404 and computer
system 402 are electrically isolated from one another.
[0043]                 The example system of Figure 4 shows what may be referred to as a
differential signaling system. That is, time varying electrical current flow (such as
electrical current illustrated by line 412) in the electrical conductor 410 induces a
corresponding current in the portion 414 of the electrical conductor 216. As the same
current flows in the electrical conductor 410 proximate to portion 416 of the electrical
conductor 214, an opposite current flow is induced in the electrical conductor 214.
Thus, communicative signals from the control circuit 404 to the surface computer
system 402 may be detected by sensing differences in current and/or voltages
between the electrical conductors 214 and 216. Likewise, communicative signals
from the surface computer 402 to the control circuit 404 may sent by inducing
differential current and/or voltages between the electrical conductors 214 and 216.
However, use of a differential signaling is only an example, and other systems are
possible.
[0044]                 Figure 5 shows an electrical block diagram of an alternate system of
communicatively coupling the control circuit 404 to the electrical conductors 214 and
216. In particular, the system 500 of Figure 5 comprises the control circuit 404,
electrical conductor 502 (which runs parallel and proximate to the electrical conductor

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                         -14
216), as well as electrical conductor 504 (which runs parallel and proximate to the
electrical conductor 214). Thus, in the example system the control circuit 404 may
send and receive data communications over electrical conductor 216 by way of
inductive coupling, and likewise send and receive data communications over
electrical conductor 214 by way of inductive coupling. The communications over
electrical conductor 214 need not be same, or even related to, the communications
over electrical conductor 216. For example, the control circuit may send messages to
the surface computer (not shown in Figure 5) over the inductive coupling with the
electrical conductor 216, and the control circuit may receive messages from the
surface computer over the inductive coupling with electrical conductor 214. Further
still, even if the sensor cable has two (or more) electrical conductors, it is not strictly
required that the control circuit 404 be communicatively coupled to all the conductors
in the sensor cable. For example, a sensor module may be arranged and constructed
to be communicatively coupled to only one (or a small subset of) the electrical
conductors within the sensor cable, such that one or dedicated groups of sensor
modules are dedicate to particular communication pathways within the sensor cable.
[0045]                 Returning to Figure 4, in some example systems having the electrical
conductor 410 placed parallel to a portion of one or more electrical conductors within
the sensor cable 108 may be sufficient to provide communicative coupling between
the control circuit 404 and the surface computer system 402. However, in order to
increase the coupling efficiency between the electrical conductors in the sensor
module and electrical conductors within the sensor cable 108, in other example
systems the electrical conductor 410 may be associated with one or more sets of
magnetic material. In Figure 4, the system 400 comprises a magnetic material 420
associated with electrical conductor 410 and portion 414 of the electrical conductor
216, and system 400 also comprises a magnetic material 422 associated with
electrical conductor 410 and portion 416 of the electrical conductor 214. The sets of
magnetic material may be any low reluctance material current available (e.g., stacks
of thin sheets of metallic material such as used in the stators of electrical motors) or
later-developed.

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                                  -15
[0046]                 In non-magnetic media (such as air, plastics, free space), the magnetic
field associated with electrical current flow in the electrical conductor 410 expands out
a certain distance from the electrical conductor 410 (as a function of the field
strength).              However, in the presence of a magnetic material, the magnetic field
attempts to confine itself to be predominantly within the magnetic material (again, as
a function of field strength).                           In the example system of Figure 4, and referring to
magnetic material 420 for purposes of explanation, the electrical conductor 410 is
situated such that the magnetic material 420 is disposed around the conductor 410.
In some example systems, the electrical conductor may run through an aperture
defined in the magnetic material 420.                                Of course, the magnetic material 420 is
confined to the sensor module outer cover (e.g., the base portion). In regions where
the magnetic material is present, the magnetic field created by electrical current flow
within the electrical conductor 410 will tend to confine itself within the magnetic
material, but then will expand out in regions lacking the magnetic material (i.e., the
direction of the portion 414 of the electrical conductor 216). Thus, the magnetic
material tends to focus or direct the magnetic field toward the portion 414 of the
electrical conductor 216. The focusing or directing of the magnetic field increasing
the inductive coupling between the conductor 410 and the portion 414 of the
conductor 216. The focusing effect of the magnetic material 420 is likewise present in
data communications from the surface computer system 402 along the electrical
conductors within the sensor cable 108.
[0047]                 Figure 6 shows a cross-sectional elevation view of the sensor cable and a
sensor module, the view taken substantially along lines 6-6 of Figure 2. In particular,
Figure 6 shows the example sensor module 204 comprising the base portion 220 and
lid portion 222. In the example sensor module, the lid portion 222 couples to the base
portion 220 by way of a hinge member 600 (where the axis of rotation about the hinge
member 600 is perpendicular to the plane of the page). The base portion 220 defines
an interior volume 602. Within the interior volume 602 are the control circuit 404,
sensor 406, and electrical conductor 410. Also visible in Figure 6 are cross-sectional
views of the magnetic materials 420 and 422 disposed within the interior volume 602.
In the example system, the electrical conductor 410 extends through apertures in the

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                         -16
magnetic materials 420 and 422, such as aperture 604 associated with magnetic
material 422. As discussed above, the magnetic materials 420 and 422 act to focus
the magnetic fields created by the electrical conductor 410 toward respective
electrical conductors 216 and 214. Likewise, the magnetic materials 420 and 422
focus magnetic fields created by the conductors 214 and 216 toward the electrical
conductor 410.
[0048]                 The specification now turns to an example electrical system which may be
implemented within a sensor module. Figure 7 shows an electrical block diagram of a
control circuit of a sensor module in accordance with at least some embodiments. In
particular, Figure 7 shows that, in example systems, the control circuit 404 can be
logically divided into a communication module 700, power module 740, a computer
system 702, and a battery 704. Each will be discussed in turn, starting with the
battery 704.
[0049]                 Battery 704 may be any suitable rechargeable battery or battery system
configured to provide operational power to the other components of the control circuit
404, as well as to power the one or more sensors (the sensors not specifically shown
in Figure 7).                 In some cases, the battery 704 may power the various electrical
components for extended periods of time (e.g., a month or more) during periods of
time when a sensor module remains on the sea floor. That is, in cases where no
power can be provided over the sensor cable 108, the battery 704 may provide
operational power for multiple geophysical surveys taken over days or weeks. In
other cases, the battery 704 may be charged by power extracted from the sensor
cable, as illustrated by the electrical connection 706 between the power module 740
and the battery 704. The various electrical connections between the battery 704 and
the other control circuit 404 devices which derive operational power from the battery
704 are not shown so as not to unduly complicate the figure.
[0050]                 The example control circuit 404 further comprises the communication
module 700.                  As the name implies, the communication module 700 may be an
interface between the computer system 702 and the electrical conductors of the
sensor cable over which messages are exchanged with the surface computer. In the
example system, and considering first messages received by the control circuit over

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                                  -17
the electrical conductor 410, the electrical conductor 410 illustratively couples to a
high pass filter 710. The high pass filter may filter lower frequency signals (such as
signals used to provide charge to the battery, discussed more below). The high pass
filter 710 may implement other electrical features, such as impedance matching and
signal amplification. The resultant signal from the high pass filter 710 couples to a
communication circuit 712. The communication circuit 712 performs demodulation
and/or decoding of the signals received over the sensor cable 108. The precise
internal electrical structure of the communication module is dependent upon the type
of modulation and communication system implemented across the sensor cable. For
example, in some systems the modulation system may be an amplitude shift keying
system where binary states are encoded in different amplitudes of a carrier frequency
(e.g., off as one state, and on as a second state).                               In yet still other cases, the
modulation system may be a frequency shift keying system wherein binary states are
encoded in different frequencies (e.g., a first frequency representing a first binary
state, and a second frequency representing a second binary state).                                  Further still,
example systems may use quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) where the
electrical conductors of the sensor cable simultaneously carry signals of different
frequency, and wherein various possible states are encoded in the relationship of the
two simultaneous signals. Regardless of the modulation system used, messages
sent from the surface computer to the sensor module are demodulated and decoded
by the communication circuit 712 and passed to the computer system 702.
[0051]                 Various types of messages may be sent from the surface computer to the
computer system 702. For example, the surface computer may send a message for
the computer system 702 to begin recording data from an attached sensor associated
with the geophysical survey. Likewise, at some later time the surface computer may
send a message to the sensor module to cease the collection of data from the
attached sensor. Other example messages include time references.
[0052]                 With regard to time references, each sensor module 404 maintains a highly
accurate time reference.                               In many cases the time reference is maintained by the
computer system 702 responsive to a highly accurate crystal oscillator (not
specifically shown). In order for geophysical data collected by all the sensor modules

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                             - 18
to be analyzed to identify parameters of an underground formation, a precise arrival
time of the acoustic energy at each sensor module is noted. In order to initially align
the time references across all the sensor modules coupled to a sensor cable, the
surface computer may send one or more messages that include a time reference.
The computer system 702 may thus receive a message with a time reference, and
update the time reference of the control circuit 404 consistent with the message.
Moreover, in some cases the sensor modules may remain on the sea floor for
extended periods of time (e.g., a month or more), and thus even if each sensor
module comprises a highly accurate time reference, over extended periods of time
drift regarding current time may occur as between sensor modules.                           Again, the
surface computer may address such issues by sending time references to the sensor
modules (e.g., a broadcast message), and wherein each sensor module receives the
message and corrects the current time to better align the time perceived by each
sensor module.
[0053]                 Still referring to Figure 7, the direction of message flow is not limited to just
messages from the surface computer to the sensor module. In some systems, the
control circuit 404, and in particular the communication module 700, may send
messages to the surface computer over the sensor cable. The message range from
acknowledgment messages (e.g., acknowledging a command to begin recording) to
large messages with data payload directed to the surface computer. Consider, as an
example, that the control circuit 404 in Figure 7 has stored therein a large quantity of
sensor data recorded during a geophysical survey operation.                        In some example
systems, during the geophysical survey, after the geophysical survey, or both, the
control circuit 404 may send the data to the surface computer over the sensor cable
using any suitable modulation scheme. In some cases, all the data recorded by the
control circuit 404 may be sent to the surface, while in other cases only a small
portion may be sent for quality control purposes (i.e., OC data).
[0054]                 Turning now to the computer system 702 of the example control
circuit 404.               In some cases, the computer system 702 comprises processor 720
coupled to a memory 722. The processor 720 may be any currently available or after
developed processor.                              The memory 722 may be the working memory for the

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                         -19
processor 720, and from which instructions are executed. In some systems, the
memory is an array of random access memory (RAM) devices. While in some
systems the processor 720 and memory 722 may be individual components
operatively coupled together, in one example system the processor 720 and memory
722 are an integrated component in the form of a low power microcontroller. The
processor 720 may further couple to a long-term storage device 724. Storage device
724 may comprise any suitable long term non-volatile storage device or devices, such
as an array of battery-backed RAM, or one or more flash memory devices.                        In
example systems, the storage device 724 may be the location that stores instructions
that enable the computer system 702, and thus the control electronics 404, to act as a
sensor module in a geophysical survey system. Further, the storage device 724 may
be the location within which sensor data recorded during a geophysical survey is
stored until the data can be sent to the surface over the geophysical cable, and/or
"downloaded" once the sensor module is retrieved to the surface.
[0055]                 In cases where sensor data is held within a sensor module until the sensor
module is brought back to the surface, the control electronics 404 may further
comprise a communication port 730 communicatively coupled to the computer system
702. In the non-submerged state, the communication port 730 may be accessible
(e.g., by removal of one or more sealed access panels) so as to perform various
tasks, such as downloading recorded sensor data from the storage device 724 and
updating the computer system 702 software or firmware. The physical and electrical
protocol implemented by the communication port 730 may take any suitable form,
such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port or IEEE 1391 "FireWire" system.
[0056]                 Still referring to Figure 7, in some example systems the battery 704 has
sufficient energy storage capacity to power a sensor module over the course of one
or more geophysical surveys. However, in other cases the battery 704 may need to
be charged, or at least the charge supplemented, during periods of time when the
sensor module is submerged. Thus, in accordance with other example systems, the
control circuit 400 further comprises a power module 740. As the name implies, the
power module 740 is designed and constructed to draw power from the sensor cable,
and use the power to charge the battery 704. In one example system, the power

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                         - 20
module 740 comprises a low pass filter 742. For example, a power signal may be
carried on the electrical conductors 214 and 216, with the power signal having a first
frequency, while the data communications (either to or from the sensor module) may
be encoded on signals having higher frequency or frequencies. The low pass filter
742 may thus extract the lower frequency signals induced on the conductor 41 0, and
may provide other electrical properties, such as impedance matching. The example
power signal that passes the low pass filter 742 may then be applied to a rectifier
circuit 744, which converts the time varying current (i.e., alternating current (AC)) into
a direct current (DC) signal. The DC signal produced by the rectifier circuit may then
be applied to the power control circuit 746. The power control circuit 746 may provide
any suitable adjustment or control to the power flow, such as voltage regulation,
current flow control, and charge control (e.g., for automatic charge cut off).
[0057]                 The various embodiments discussed to this point have assumed a sensor
cable with two electrical conductors, and that communications with all the sensor
modules could be achieved over two electrical conductors.                   In some example
systems, two conductors are sufficient (e.g., shorter sensor cables, or sensor cables
to which a smaller number of sensor modules are attached).                     In other cases,
however, the length of the sensor cable and/or the number of sensor modules
coupled to the sensor cable may make communicating with each sensor module
difficult. In some cases, additional electrical conductors within the outer jacket 208
may be included, with the sensor modules either designed to communicate with
specific conductors within the sensor cable, or the radial position of the sensor
modules adjusted such that each sensor module communicates with a specific
electrical conductor or set of electrical conductors. In other cases, however, sensor
cable is logically divided into smaller communication regions, where each region may
have a plurality of sensor modules, and where a wide-band backbone communication
system communicates with each logical region.
[0058]                 Figure 8 shows, in block diagram form, an example system where the
sensor cable is divided into logical regions. In particular, Figure 8 shows a sensor
cable 108 comprising the outer jacket 208 (the outer jacket shown in dashed lines).
The sensor cable 108 is logically divided into a plurality of communication regions

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                         - 21
800, 802, and 804. Within each communication region resides a plurality of electrical
conductors. For example, within region 800 resides electrical conductors 806 and
808. Within region 802 resides electrical conductors 810 and 812. Finally, within
region 804 resides electrical conductors 814 and 816. Thus, sensor cable portions
discussed to this point (e.g., Figure 2) could be a region within an overall sensor
cable.
[0059]                 In addition to the electrical conductors within each region, the sensor cable
108 in Figure 8 further comprises one or more electrical power conductors 820, and
one or more back-bone communication channels 822. In one example embodiment,
the back-bone communication channel 822 is one or more fiber optic cables, coaxial
cable or cables, one more twisted pairs, or combinations thereof. As the name
implies, the back-bone communication channel 822 in the example embodiments is
main communication pathway to and from the surface computer 402.                               Each
communication region extracts message traffic from the back-bone communication
channel 822, and injects message traffic onto the back-bone communication channel
822 by way of a respective interface device. For example, interface device 830 may
draw operational power from the electrical power conductors 820, and may provide
the operational power on the conductors 806 and 808 to power the attached sensor
modules 832, 834, and 836. The interface device 830 may extract message traffic
from the back-bone communication channel destined for the sensor modules in the
communication region 800, and may inject message traffic onto the back-bone
communication channel 822 from the sensor modules in the communication region
800. Similarly, interface device 840 may draw operational power from the electrical
power conductors 820, and may provide the operational power on the conductors 810
and 812 to power the attached sensor modules 842, 844, and 846. The interface
device 840 may extract message traffic the back-bone communication channel
destined for the sensor modules in the communication region 802, and may inject
message traffic onto the back-bone communication channel 822 from the sensor
modules in the communication region 802. Similarly, interface device 840 may draw
operational power from the electrical power conductors 820, and may provide the
operational power on the conductors 810 and 812 to power the attached sensor

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                               - 22
modules 842, 844, and 846. Finally, interface device 850 may draw operational
power from the electrical power conductors 820, and may provide the operational
power on the conductors 814 and 816 to power the attached sensor modules 852,
854, and 856. The interface device 850 may extract message traffic the back-bone
communication pathway channel for the sensor modules in the communication region
802, and may inject message traffic onto the back-bone communication channel 822
from the sensor modules in the communication region 802.
[0060]                 Referring to communication                  region 800 as illustrative of all the
communication regions, the interface device 830 may communicate on the back-bone
communication channel using the communication protocol of the back-bone
communication channel 822.                               For example, in situations where the back-bone
communication channel 822 is a fiber optical channel, the surface computer and the
interface devices may communication a synchronous optical networking (SONET)
protocol. In yet still other example cases, the back-bone communication channel 822
may be dedicated point-to-point system (i.e., computer system 402 to each interface
device 830, 840, and 850 over separate channels). In one example system, the
separate channels may each be an Ethernet protocol systems over copper.
[0061]                 Regardless of the type of physical system and protocol implement on the
back-bone communication channel 822, the interface device 830 may provide
protocol translation and message packet transfers to and from the sensor modules
within the example communication region 800. On the electrical conductor 806 and
808 side, any suitable communication system and protocol may be used.                                 For
example, the communications between the interface device 830 and the sensor
modules 832, 834, and 836 may implement a modified token ring network, where
each sensor module communicates only when the sensor modules receives the
virtual token granting broadcast permission.                              In other cases, a time-division
multiplexing scheme may be used to assign time windows within which each sensor
module may broadcast messages.
[0062]                 Regardless of the precise protocol, logically dividing the sensor cable into
communications regions may facilitate better two-way communications between the
surface computer 402 and the sensor modules. It is noted that the example interface

 -\,dc\1erove\NRPortb-DCC\DER\h36803l II d-a-29/0 1/2018
                                                         - 23
devices 830, 840, and 850 may be physically too large to reside within the outer
jacket 208 in some cases. Thus, in some example systems, the interface devices
may be coupled within the sensor cable 108 periodically (e.g., one every kilometer) by
way of wet-connectors, thus establishing each communication region.
[0063]                 Figure 9 shows a method in accordance with at least some embodiments.
 In particular, the method starts (block 900) and comprises attaching a first sensor
module to a sensor cable having an outer jacket, the first sensor module electrically
isolated from an electrical conductor disposed within the outer jacket of the sensor
cable (block 902). For example, the attaching may comprise attaching a sensor
module such as shown in Figure 2 to the sensor cable by a "clam-shell" mechanism.
The method may then include attaching a second sensor module to the sensor cable,
the second sensor module electrically isolated from an electrical conductor disposed
within the outer jacket of the sensor cable (block 904). Either after attaching the
various sensor modules, or contemporaneously with the attaching of the sensor
modules, the method may include placing the sensor cable and the sensor modules
onto a sea floor (block 906). For example, after a sensor module is attached on the
deck of the work vessel 112, the sensor cable 108 may be fed into the water.
Thereafter, the method may comprise: communicating with the sensor modules by
way of the electrical conductor disposed within the outer jacket (block 908); collecting
geophysical data by the first and second sensor modules while the sensor cable is on
the sea floor (block 910); and downloading to a computer system geophysical data
from the first and second sensor modules (block 912). The downloading may take
place while the sensor modules are on the sea floor (e.g., over the electrical
conductors of the sensor cable), or the downloading may take place once each
sensor module is brought back to the surface (e.g., through the communication port
730). Thereafter the method ends (block 912), in some cases to be restarted at the
next geophysical survey.
