                The entire disclosure in the complete specification of our Australian Patent
 5 Application No. 2013212758 is by this cross-reference incorporated into the present
   specification.
                                                             Field
   The invention relates to the field of human genetics, more specifically neuromuscular
10 disorders. The invention in particular relates to the use of an oligonucleotide with improved
   characteristics enhancing clinical applicability as further defined herein.
                                                  Background of the invention
             Neuromuscular diseases are characterized by impaired functioning of the muscles due
15 to either muscle or nerve pathology (myopathies and neuropathies). The myopathies include
   genetic         muscular           dystrophies   that are characterized  by progressive weakness and
   degeneration of skeletal, heart and/or smooth muscle. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
   and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are the most common childhood forms of muscular
   dystrophy. DMD is a severe, lethal neuromuscular disorder resulting in a dependency on
20 wheelchair support before the age of 12 and patients often die before the age of thirty due to
   respiratory- or heart failure. It is caused by reading frame-shifting deletions (~67%) or
   duplications (~7%) of one or more exons, or by point mutations (~25%) in the 2.24 Mb DMD
   gene, resulting in the absence of functional dystrophin. BMD is also caused by mutations in
   the DMD gene, but these maintain the open reading frame, yield semi-functional dystrophin
25 proteins, and result in a typically much milder phenotype and longer lifespan. During the last
   decade, specific modification of splicing in order to restore the disrupted reading frame of the
   transcript has emerged as a promising therapy for DMD (van Ommen et al., 2008; Yokota et
   al., 2007; van Deutekom et al., 2007; Goemans et al., 2011; Cirak et al., 201 1).Using highly
   sequence-specific antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) which bind to the exon flanking or
30 containing the mutation and which interfere with its splicing signals, the skipping of that
   exon can be induced during the processing of the DMD pre-mRNA. Despite the resulting
   truncated transcript, the open reading frame is restored and a protein is introduced which is
   similar to those found in BMD patients. AON-induced exon skipping provides a mutation
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                            2
   specific,         and thus personalized,         therapeutic  approach for DMD    patients.  Several
   oligonucleotides are currently being developed for skipping most relevant exons of the
   dystrophin pre-mRNA such as exons 2, 8, 9, 17, 29, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54,
   55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60-63, 71-78 as described in WO 02/024906, W02004/083446,
 5 W02006/112705,                    W02007/135105,    WO    2009/139630,  WO  2010/050801     or  WO
   2010/050802.
             As the majority of the mutations cluster around exons 45 to 55, the skipping of one
   specific exon may be therapeutic for many patients with different mutations. The skipping of
   exon 51 applies to the largest subset of patients (-13%), including those with deletions of
10 exons 45 to 50, 48 to 50, 50, or 52. The AONs applied are chemically modified to resist
   endonucleases, exonucleases and RNaseH, and to promote RNA binding and duplex stability.
   Two different AON chemistries are currently being developed for exon 51 skipping in DMD:
   2'-O-methyl               phosphorothioate   RNA     AONs    (2OMePS,   GSK2402968/PROO51)       and
   phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO, AVI-4658) (Goemans et al., 2011; Cirak
15 et al., 2011). In two independent phase I/II studies, both were shown to specifically induce
   exon 51 skipping and at least partly restore dystrophin expression at the muscle fiber
   membranes after systemic administration. Although AONs are typically not well taken up by
   healthy muscle fibers, the dystrophin deficiency in DMD, resulting in damaged and thus
   more permeable fiber membranes, actually promotes uptake. In studies in the dystrophin
20 deficient mdx mouse model, 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA oligonucleotides have
   demonstrated an up to 10 times higher uptake in different muscle groups when compared to
   that in wild type mice (Heemskerk et al., 2010). Although the recent phase I/II results with
   both 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA and phosphorodiamidate morpholino AONs in
   DMD patients confirm this enhanced uptake in dystrophic muscle, the different chemical
25 modifications seemed to result in a differential uptake by and distribution through muscle.
   The levels of novel dystrophin in both studies after 3 months of treatment were promising but
   still moderate and challenges the field to investigate next generation oligochemistry.
             The particular characteristics of a chosen chemistry at least in part affects the delivery
   of an AON to the target transcript: administration route, biostability, biodistribution, intra
30 tissue distribution, and cellular uptake and trafficking. In addition, further optimization of
   oligonucleotide chemistry is conceived to enhance binding affinity and stability, enhance
   activity, improve safety, and/or to reduce cost of goods by reducing length or improving
   synthesis and/or purification procedures. Multiple chemical modifications have become

                                                    3
   generally and/or commercially available to the research community (such as 2'-O-methyl
   RNA and 5-substituted pyrimidines and 2,6-diaminopurines), whereas most others still
   present significant synthetic effort to obtain. Especially preliminary encouraging results have
   been obtained using 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA containing modifications on the
 5 pyrimidine and purine bases as identified herein.
             In conclusion, to enhance the therapeutic applicability of AONs for DMD, there is a
   need for AONs with further improved characteristics.
             It is to be understood that if any prior art publication is referred to herein, such

                                      Description of the invention
   Oligonucleotide
   In a first aspect, the invention provides an oligonucleotide comprising a 2'-O-methyl RNA
15 monomer and a phosphorothioate backbone or consisting of 2'-O-methyl RNA monomers
   linked by phosphorothioate backbones, and comprising a 5-methylpyrimidine and/or a 2,6
   diaminopurine base preferably for use as a medicament for treating Duchenne Muscular
   Dystrophy or Becker Muscular Dystrophy.
   Therefore, the invention provides an oligonucleotide comprising a 2'-O-methyl RNA
20 monomer, a phosphorothioate backbone              and a 5-methylpyrimidine      and/or a 2,6
   diaminopurine base preferably for use as a medicament for treating Duchenne Muscular
   Dystrophy or Becker Muscular Dystrophy.
   Accordingly the invention also provides an oligonucleotide consisting of 2'-O-methyl RNA
   monomers and a phosphorothioate backbone and comprises a 5-methylpyrimidine and/or a
25 2,6-diaminopurine base preferably for use as a medicament for treating Duchenne Muscular
   Dystrophy or Becker Muscular Dystrophy.
   It is clear for the skilled person that "an RNA monomer" as present in an oligonucleotide of
   the invention may also be identified as being "an RNA nucleotide residue". Both terms may
   be used interchangeably throughout the application.
30 Within the context of the invention, "a" in each of the following expressions means "at least
   one": a 2'-O-methyl RNA monomer, a 2'-O-methyl RNA nucleotide residue, a 2'-O-methyl
   phosphorothioate RNA monomer, a 5-methylpyrimidine base, a 2,6-diaminopurine base.
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                     4
   Within the context of the invention, it is clear for the skilled person that "an oligonucleotide
   comprising a 2'-O-methyl RNA monomer, a phosphorothioate backbone" could be replaced
   by "an oligonucleotide comprising a 2'-O-methyl RNA monomer linked by phosphorothioate
   backbones". The same holds for "an oligonucleotide consisting of 2'-O-methyl RNA
 5 monomers and a phosphorothioate backbone" that could be replaced by "an oligonucleotide
   consisting of 2'-O-methyl RNA monomer linked by phosphorothioate backbones".
   In the context of the invention, the expression "for use as a medicament for treating
   Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Becker Muscular Dystrophy" could be replaced by the
   expression "for use in the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Becker Muscular
10 Dystrophy."
   Preferably, an oligonucleotide is an oligonucleotide with less than 34 nucleotides. Said
   oligonucleotide may have 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,
   28, 29, 30, 31, 32, or 33 nucleotides. Such oligonucleotide may also be identified as an
15 oligonucleotide having from 10 to 33 nucleotides.
   Accordingly, an oligonucleotide of the invention comprises a 2'-O-methyl RNA monomer
   and a phosphorothioate backbone and comprises less than 34 nucleotides (i.e. it comprises
    10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, or 33
   nucleotides).
20 Accordingly, an oligonucleotide of the invention consists of 2'-O-methyl RNA monomers
   linked by phosphorothioate backbone and comprises less than 34 nucleotides (i.e. it
   comprises 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31,
   32, or 33 nucleotides)
   Accordingly, an oligonucleotide of the invention comprises a 2'-O-methyl RNA monomer, a
25 phosphorothioate backbone, comprises less than 34 nucleotides (i.e. it comprises 10, 11, 12,
    13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, or 33 nucleotides)
   and a 5-methylpyrimidine and/or a 2,6-diaminopurine base.
   Accordingly, an oligonucleotide of the invention consists of 2'-O-methyl RNA monomers
   linked by phosphorothioate backbone, and comprises less than 34 nucleotides (i.e. it
30 comprises 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31,
   32, or 33 nucleotides) and a 5-methylpyrimidine and/or a 2,6-diaminopurine base.
   Each of these oligonucleotides is for use or may be for use as a medicament for treating
   Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Becker Muscular Dystrophy.
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                             5
   An oligonucleotide of the invention comprises or consists of a 2'-0-methyl phosphorothioate
   RNA monomer. Such oligonucleotide comprises a 2'-O-methyl RNA monomer connected
   through           or       linked    by a phosphorothioate    backbone   or  consists  of 2'-O-methyl
 5 phosphorothioate                   RNA. Preferably, such oligonucleotide   consists of a 2'-O-methyl
   phosphorothioate RNA. Such chemistry is known to the skilled person. Throughout the
   application,              an oligonucleotide     comprising a   2'-O-methyl   RNA     monomer  and  a
   phosphorothioate backbone may be replaced by an oligonucleotide comprising a 2'-O-methyl
   phosphorothioate RNA. Throughout the application, an oligonucleotide consisting of 2'-0
10 methyl RNA monomers linked by or connected through phosphorothioate backbones may be
   replaced by an oligonucleotide consisting of 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA.
   In the context of the invention, "backbone" is used to identify the linkage between two sugar
   units or modified versions of a sugar unit or moiety as later defined herein (i.e.
   intemucleoside linkage). Throughout the description, the words "backbone", "intemucleoside
15 linkage" and "linkage" may be used interchangeably. Thus, an oligonucleotide having 10
   nucleotides contains 9 backbones, linking the 10 sugar units or modified versions of a sugar
   unit or moiety as later defined herein together. At least one of the backbones of the
   oligonucleotide according to the invention consists of a phosphorothioate moiety, linking two
   sugar units or modified versions of a sugar unit or moiety as later defined herein. Thus, at
20 least one phosphodiester backbones present in RNA is replaced by phosphorothioate moiety.
   A naturally occurring intemucleoside linkage or backbone is the 3' to 5' phosphodiester
   linkage.
   In addition, an oligonucleotide of the invention may comprise a base modification that
25 increases binding affinity to target strands, increases melting temperature of the resulting
   duplex of said oligonucleotide with its target, and/or decreases immunostimulatory effects,
   and/or increases biostability, and/or improves biodistribution and/or intra-tissue distribution,
   and/or cellular uptake and trafficking. In a more preferred embodiment, an oligonucleotide of
   the invention comprises a 5-methylpyrimidine and/or a 2,6-diaminopurine base. A 5
30 methylpyrimidine base is selected from a 5-methylcytosine and/or a 5-methyluracil and/or a
   thymine, in which thymine is identical to 5-methyluracil.
   Accordingly, the expression "comprises a 5-methylcytosine and/or a 5-methyluracil and/or a
   2,6-diaminopurine base" in the context of the modified oligonucleotide of the invention may
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                   6
   be replaced by "comprises a base modification selected from the group consisting of: a 5
   methylcytosine, a 5-methyluracil and a 2,6-diaminopurine base".
   Where an oligonucleotide of the invention has two or more such base modifications, said
 5 base modifications may be identical, for example all such modified bases in the
   oligonucleotide are 5-methylcytosine, or said base modifications may be combinations of
   different base modifications, for example the oligonucleotide may have one or more 5
   methylcytosines and one or more 5-methyluracils.
    'Thymine' and '5-methyluracil' may be interchanged throughout the document. In analogy,
10 2,6-diaminopurine is identical to 2-aminoadenine and these terms may be interchanged
   throughout the document. The use of 2,6-diaminopurine has been disclosed in another
   context in US 7,745,420.
   The term "base modification" or "modified base" as identified herein refers to the
   modification of an existing base (i.e. pyrimidine or purine base) or to the de novo synthesis of
15 a base. This de novo synthetized base could be qualified as "modified" by comparison to an
   existing base. An oligonucleotide of the invention comprising a 5-methylcytosine and/or a 5
   methyluracil and/or a 2,6-diaminopurine base means that at least one of the cytosine
   nucleobases of said oligonucleotide has been modified by substitution of the proton at the 5
   position of the pyrimidine ring with a methyl group, i.e. a 5-substituted cytosine, and/or that
20 at least one of the uracil nucleobases of said oligonucleotide has been modified by
   substitution of the proton at the 5-position of the pyrimidine ring with a methyl group (i.e. a
   5-methyluracil), and/or that at least one of the adenine nucleobases of said oligonucleotide
   has been modified by substitution of the proton at the 2-position with an amino group (i.e. a
   2,6-diaminopurine), respectively. Within the context of the invention, the expression "the
25 substitution of a proton with a methyl group in position 5 of the pyrimidine ring" may be
   replaced by the expression "the substitution of a pyrimidine with a 5-methylpyrimidine,"
   with pyrimidine referring to only uracil, only cytosine or both. Likewise, within the context
   of the invention, the expression "the substitution of a proton with an amino group in position
   2 of adenine" may be replaced by the expression "the substitution of an adenine with a 2,6
30 diaminopurine." If said oligonucleotide comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or more cytosines,
   uracils, and/or adenines, at least one, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or more cytosines, uracils and/or
   adenines respectively have been modified this way. Preferably all cytosines, uracils and/or
   adenines have been modified this way or substituted by 5-methylcytosine, 5-methyluracil
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                   7
   and/or 2,6-diaminopurine, respectively. No need to say that this aspect of the invention could
   only be applied to oligonucleotides comprising at least one cytosine, uracil, or adenine,
   respectively, in their sequence. An oligonucleotide comprising at least one 5-methylcytosine,
   5-methyluracil and/or 2,6-diaminopurine may be called a modified oligonucleotide by
 5 reference to its non-modified counterpart comprising no 5-methylcytosine, no 5-methyluracil
   and no 2,6-diaminopurine. A non-modified counterpart may also be identified as being an
   oliognucleotide comprising unmodified cytosines, unmodified uraciles and unmodified
   adenines. Preferred non-modified sequences are represented by one of the following base or
   nucleotide sequences comprising or consisting of SEQ ID NO:91, 93-170.
10
   We discovered that the presence of a 5-methylcytosine, 5-methyluracil and/or a 2,6
   diaminopurine in an oligonucleotide of the invention has a positive effect on at least one of
   the parameters of said oligonucleotides. In this context, parameters may include: binding
   affinity and/or kinetics, exon skipping activity, biostability, (intra-tissue) distribution, cellular
15 uptake and/or trafficking, and/or      immunogenicity of said oligonucleotide, as explained
   below. Said positive effect may be correlated with the number or percentage of base
   modifications incorporated. For the parameter of exon skipping activity, we found for some
   oligonucleotides that modification of nucleobases is not needed per se to obtain relatively
   high levels of exon skipping. This may be related to the specific role (and strength) of the
20 specifically targeted sequence within the exon in its splicing process.
   Binding affinity and kinetics depend on the AON's thermodynamic properties. These are at
   least in part determined by the melting temperature of said oligonucleotide (Tm; calculated
   with                     e.g.     the    oligonucleotide             properties           calculator
   (http://www.unc.edu/-cail/biotool/oligo/index.html                                                 or
25 http://eu.idtdna.com/analyzer/Applications/OligoAnalyzer/)       for single stranded RNA using
   the basic Tm and the nearest neighbor model), and/or the free energy of the oligonucleotide
   target exon complex (using RNA structure version 4.5 or RNA fold version 3.5). If a Tm is
   increased, the exon skipping activity typically increases, but when a Tm is too high, the AON
   is expected to become less sequence-specific. An acceptable Tm and free energy depend on
30 the sequence of the oligonucleotide. Therefore, it is difficult to give preferred ranges for each
   of these parameters.

                                                              8
   Exon skipping activity is preferably measured by analysing total RNA isolated from AON
   treated muscle cell cultures or muscle tissue by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
   reaction (RT-PCR) using DMD gene-specific primers flanking the targeted exon as described
   (Aartsma-Rus et al., 2003). RT-PCR products are analyzed on 1-2% agarose gels or with the
 5 Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, The Netherlands). The ratio of shorter
   transcript fragments, representing transcripts in which the targeted exon is skipped, to the
   total of transcript products is assessed (calculated as percentage of exon skipping induced by
   an AON). Shorter fragments may also be sequenced to determine the correctness and
   specificity of the targeted exon skipping. An increase in percentage of exon skipping may be
10 detected for a modified oligonucleotide of the invention (i.e. an oligonucleotide comprising a
   2'-O-methyl RNA monomer, a phosphorothioate backbone and a 5-methylpyrimidine and/or
   a 2,6-diaminopurine base) compared to its non-modified counterpart (i.e. an oligonucleotide
   comprising a 2'-O-methyl RNA monomer, a phosphorothioate backbone and not comprising
   any 5-methylpyrimidine and any 2,6-diaminopurine base). Said increase is preferably a
15 detectable increase assessed as explained above using RT-PCR. Said increase is preferably an
   increase of at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 7 0%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 110%,
    120%, 130%, 140%, 150%, 160%, 170%, 180%, 190%, 200%, 210%, 300%, 400%, 500%,
   600%,        7 0 0 %, 800%,        900%, 1000%, or at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 times higher, or
   even 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20 times higher or more.
20
   Biodistribution and biostability are preferably at least in part determined by a validated
   hybridization ligation assay adapted from Yu et al., 2002. In an embodiment, plasma or
   homogenized tissue samples are incubated with a specific capture oligonucleotide probe.
   After separation, a DIG-labeled oligonucleotide is ligated to the complex and detection
25 followed using an anti-DIG antibody-linked peroxidase. Non-compartmental
   pharmacokinetic analysis is performed using WINNONLIN software package (model 200,
   version 5.2, Pharsight, Mountainview, CA). Levels of AON (ug) per mL plasma or mg tissue
   are monitored over time to assess area under the curve (AUC), peak concentration (Cmax),
   time to peak concentration (Tmax), terminal half life and absorption lag time (tiag). Such a
30 preferred assay has been disclosed in the experimental part.
   AONs may stimulate an innate immune response by activating the Toll-like receptors (TLR),
   including TLR9 and TLR7 (Krieg et al., 1995) . The activation of TLR9 typically occurs due
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                   9
   to the presence of non-methylated CG sequences present in oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs),
   by mimicking bacterial DNA which activates the innate immune system through TLR9
   mediated cytokine release. The 2'-O-methyl modification is however suggested to markedly
   reduce such possible effect. TLR7 has been described to recognize uracil repeats in RNA
 5 (Diebold et al., 2006).
   Activation of TLR9 and TLR7 result in a set of coordinated immune responses that include
   innate immunity (macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), and NK cells)(Krieg et al., 1995; Krieg,
   2000). Several chemo- and cytokines, such as IP-10, TNFa, IL-6, MCP-1 and IFNa (Wagner,
    1999; Popovic et al., 2006) have been implicated in this process. The inflammatory cytokines
10 attract additional defensive cells from the blood, such as T and B cells. The levels of these
   cytokines can be investigated by in vitro testing. In short, human whole blood is incubated
   with increasing concentrations of AONs after which the levels of the cytokines are
   determined by standard commercially available ELISA kits. Such a preferred assay has been
   described in the experimental part. A decrease in immunogenicity preferably corresponds to a
15 detectable decrease of concentration of at least one of the cytokines mentioned above by
   comparison to the concentration of corresponding cytokine in an assay in a cell treated with
   an oligonucleotide comprising at least one 5-methylcytosine compared to a cell treated with a
   corresponding oligonucleotide having no 5-methylcytosines.
20 Accordingly, a preferred oligonucleotide of the invention has an improved parameter, such as
   an acceptable or a decreased immunogenicity and/or a better biodistribution and/or
   acceptable or improved RNA binding kinetics and/or thermodynamic properties by
   comparison to a corresponding oligonucleotide consisting of a 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate
   RNA without a 5-methylcytosine, a 5-methyluracil and a 2,6-diaminopurine (i.e. so called
25 non-modified oligonucleotide). Said non-modified oligonucleotide may also be identified as
   being an oliognucleotide comprising unmodified cytosines, unmodified uraciles and
   unmodified adenines. Each of these parameters could be assessed using assays known to the
   skilled person or preferably as disclosed herein.
30 Below other chemistries and modifications of the oligonucleotide of the invention are
   defined. These additional chemistries and modifications may be present in combination with
   the chemistry already defined for said oligonucleotide, i.e. the presence of a 5

                                                                 10
   methylcytosine, a 5-methyluracil and/or a 2,6-diaminopurine, and the oligonucleotide
   comprising or consisting of a 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA.
   A preferred oligonucleotide of the invention comprises or consists of an RNA molecule or a
 5 modified RNA molecule. In a preferred embodiment, an oligonucleotide is single stranded.
   The skilled person will understand that it is however possible that a single stranded
   oligonucleotide                  may   form    an  internal    double   stranded    structure.  However,    this
   oligonucleotide is still named a single stranded oligonucleotide in the context of this
   invention.
10 In addition to the modifications described above, the oligonucleotide of the invention may
   comprise further modifications such as different types of nucleic acid monomers or
   nucleotides as described below. Different types of nucleic acid monomers may be used to
   generate an oligonucleotide of the invention. Said oligonucleotide may have at least one
   backbone, and/or sugar modification and/or at least one base modification compared to an
15 RNA-based oligonucleotide.
   A base modification includes a modified version of the natural purine and pyrimidine bases
   (e.g. adenine, uracil, guanine, cytosine, and thymine), such as hypoxanthine, orotic acid,
   agmatidine, lysidine, 2-thiopyrimidine (e.g. 2-thiouracil, 2-thiothymine), G-clamp and its
   derivatives, 5-substituted pyrimidine (e.g. 5-halouracil, 5-propynyluracil, 5-propynylcytosine,
20 5-aminomethyluracil,                        5-hydroxymethyluracil,           5-aminomethylcytosine,           5
   hydroxymethylcytosine,                     Super    T),     7-deazaguanine,      7-deazaadenine,     7-aza-2,6
   diaminopurine,                     8-aza-7-deazaguanine,        8-aza-7-deazaadenine,        8-aza-7-deaza-2,6
   diaminopurine, Super G, Super A, and N4-ethylcytosine,                            or derivatives thereof; N2_
   cyclopentylguanine (cPent-G), N2 -cyclopentyl-2-aminopurine (cPent-AP), and N 2-propyl-2
25 aminopurine (Pr-AP), pseudouracil or derivatives thereof; and degenerate or universal bases,
   like 2,6-difluorotoluene                  or absent bases like abasic        sites (e.g.   1-deoxyribose,   1,2
   dideoxyribose, 1-deoxy-2-0-methylribose;                     or pyrrolidine derivatives in which the ring
   oxygen has been replaced with nitrogen (azaribose)). Examples of derivatives of Super A,
   Super G and Super T can be found in US patent 6,683,173 (Epoch Biosciences), which is
30 incorporated here entirely by reference. cPent-G, cPent-AP and Pr-AP were shown to reduce
   immunostimulatory effects when incorporated in siRNA (Peacock H. et al. J Am. Chem. Soc.
   2011, 133, 9200).

   A pseudouracil is a naturally occuring isomerized version of uracil, with a C-glycoside rather
   than the regular N-glycoside as in uridine. Pseudouridine-containing synthetic mRNA may
   have an improved safety profile compared to uridine-containing mRNA (WO 2009127230,
   incorporated here in its entirety by reference).
 5 In an embodiment, an oligonucleotide of the invention comprises an abasic site or an abasic
   monomer. Within the context of the invention, such monomer may be called an abasic site or
   an abasic monomer. An abasic monomer or abasic site is a monomer or building block that
   lacks a nucleobase by comparison to a corresponding monomer comprising a nucleobase.
   Within the invention, an abasic monomer is thus a building block part of an oligonucleotide
10 but lacking a nucleobase. Such abasic monomer may be present or linked or attached or
   conjugated to a free terminus of an oligonucleotide.
   In a more preferred embodiment, an oligonucleotide of the invention comprises 1-20 or more
   abasic monomers. Therefore, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
   or more abasic monomers may be present in an oligonucleotide of the invention.

   In another embodiment, an oligonucleotide comprises a monothiophosphate moiety at the 5'

   the 3' terminal residue. These monothiophosphate groups have been shown to improve
   oligonucleotide stability (e.g. US patent application 20120148664 - miRagen).
   With the advent of nucleic acid mimicking technology it has become possible to generate
15 molecules that have a similar, preferably the same hybridization characteristics in kind not
   necessarily in amount as nucleic acid itself. Such functional equivalents are of course also
   suitable for use in the invention.
   The skilled person will understand that not each sugar, base, and/or backbone may be
20 modified the same way. Several distinct modified sugars, bases and/or backbones may be
   combined into one single oligonucleotide of the invention.
   A person skilled in the art will also recognize that there are many synthetic derivatives of
   oligonucleotides. A backbone modification includes a modified version of the phosphodiester

   Preferably, said oligonucleotide comprises RNA, as RNA/RNA duplexes are very stable. It is
   preferred that an RNA oligonucleotide comprises a modification providing the RNA with an
   additional property, for instance resistance to endonucleases, exonucleases, and RNaseH,

15 preferably all adenines substituted with 2,6-diaminopurines, or
   At least one and preferably all adenines substituted with 2,6-diaminopurines.
   However, an oligonucleotide may also have at least one or at least two or at least half or all

   invention preferably based on SEQ ID NO: 14-90 has x cytosines, x being an integer ranged
20 from 1 to 33, a corresponding modified oligonucleotide of the invention may have 1, 2, 3, ...
   (x-2), (x-1), x 5-methylcytosines.     If x is 3 in such a non-modified oligonucleotide, the

   corresponding modified oligonucleotide is 1, 2, 3 or 4.
25 If x is 5 in such a non-modified oligonucleotide, the number of 5-methylcytosines in a

                Preferably, an oligonucleotide of the invention is for use as a medicament for DMD,
   more preferably said oligonucleotide is for use in therapeutic RNA modulation. Therefore, an
 5 oligonucleotide is an antisense oligonucleotide (AON). An antisense oligonucleotide is an
   oligonucleotide which is reverse complementary to a specific sequence of the DMD or
   dystrophin pre-mRNA derived from the coding sense strand of a DNA of an individual. This
   oligonucleotide binds to and/or targets and/or hybridizes and/or is able to bind to and/or is
   able to target and/or is able to hybridize said sequence of said pre-mRNA. The objective of
10 RNA modulation for DMD is to skip one or more specific exons in the DMD or dystrophin
   pre-mRNA in order to restore the open reading frame of the transcript and to induce the
   expression of a shorter but (more) functional dystrophin protein, with the ultimate goal to be
   able to interfere with the course of the disease
15              In a preferred embodiment, an oligonucleotide of the invention is thus used for
   inducing exon-skipping in the DMD or dystrophin pre-mRNA in a cell, in an organ, in a
   tissue and/or in an individual. Exon-skipping results in a mature DMD or dystrophin mRNA
   that does not contain a skipped exon and thus, when said exon codes for amino acids, can
   lead to the expression of a shorter protein product. The skipping of an exon is preferably
20 induced by the binding of an AON to specific exon-internal sequences comprising splicing
   regulatory elements, the splice sites and/or intronic branchpoint sequences.
   As defined herein a DMD pre-mRNA preferably means a pre-mRNA of a DMD gene coding
   for a dystrophin protein. A mutated DMD pre-mRNA corresponds to a pre-mRNA of a BMD
25 or DMD patient with a mutation when compared to a wild type DMD pre-mRNA of a non
   affected person, resulting in (reduced levels of) an aberrant protein (BMD), or the absence of
   functional dystrophin (DMD). A DMD pre-mRNA is also named a dystrophin pre-mRNA. A
   DMD gene may also be named a dystrophin gene. Dystrophin and DMD may be used
   interchangeably throughout the application.
30
   A patient is preferably intended to mean a patient having DMD or BMD as later defined
   herein or a patient susceptible to develop DMD or BMD due to his or her genetic
   background. In the case of a DMD patient, an oligonucleotide used will preferably correct
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                        18
   one mutation as present in the DMD gene of said patient and create a protein that will look
   like a BMD protein: said protein will preferably be a functional or semi-functional dystrophin
   as later defined herein. In the case of a BMD patient, an oligonucleotide as used will
   preferably correct one mutation as present in the BMD gene of said patient and create a
 5 dystrophin which will be more functional than the dystrophin which was originally present in
   said BMD patient.
   As defined herein, a functional dystrophin is preferably a wild type dystrophin corresponding
   to a protein having the amino acid sequence as identified in SEQ ID NO: 1. As defined
   herein, a semi-functional dystrophin is preferably a BMD-like dystrophin corresponding to a
10 protein having an acting binding domain in its N terminal part (first 240 amino acids at the N
   terminus), a cysteine-rich domain (amino acid 3361 till 3685) and a C terminal domain (last
   325 amino acids at the C terminus) each of these domains being present in a wild type
   dystrophin as known to the skilled person. The amino acids indicated herein correspond to
   amino acids of the wild type dystrophin being represented by SEQ ID NO: 1. In other words,
15 a functional or a semi-functional dystrophin is a dystrophin which exhibits at least to some
   extent an activity of a wild type dystrophin. "At least to some extent" preferably means at
   least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 7 0%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 100% of a corresponding
   activity of a wild type functional dystrophin. In this context, an activity of a functional
   dystrophin is preferably binding to actin and to the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein
20 complex (DGC or DAPC) (Ehmsen J et al, 2002).
                 Binding of dystrophin to actin and to the DGC or DAPC complex may be visualized
   by either co-immunoprecipitation using total protein extracts or immunofluorescence analysis
   of cross-sections using various antibodies reacting with the different members of the
   complex, from a control (non-DMD) biopsy of one from a muscle suspected to be dystrophic,
25 pre- and/or post-treatment, as known to the skilled person.
                Individuals or patients suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically have a
   mutation in the gene encoding dystrophin (the DMD or dystrophin gene) that prevents
   synthesis of the complete protein, i.e a premature stop codon prevents the synthesis of the C
   terminus. In Becker muscular dystrophy the dystrophin gene also comprises a mutation
30 compared to the wild type but the mutation does typically not result in a premature stop
   codon and the C-terminus is typically synthesized. As a result a functional or semi-functional
   dystrophin protein is synthesized that has at least the same activity in kind as the wild type
   protein, although not necessarily the same amount of activity. The genome of a BMD patient
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                  19
   typically encodes a dystrophin protein comprising the N terminal part (first 240 amino acids
   at the N terminus), a cysteine-rich domain (amino acid 3361 till 3685) and a C-terminal
   domain (last 325 amino acids at the C-terminus) but in the majority of cases its central rod
   shaped domain is shorter than the one of a wild type dystrophin (Monaco et al. , 1988).
 5 Antisense oligonucleotide-induced exon skipping for the treatment of DMD is typically
   directed to overcome a premature stop in the pre-mRNA by skipping an exon, preferably in
   the central rod-domain shaped domain, to correct the open reading frame and allow synthesis
   of remainder of the dystrophin protein including the C-terminus, albeit that the protein is
   somewhat smaller as a result of a smaller rod domain. In a preferred embodiment, an
10 individual having DMD and being treated by an oligonucleotide as defined herein will be
   provided a dystrophin which exhibits at least to some extent an activity of a wild type
   dystrophin. More preferably, if said individual is a Duchenne patient or is suspected to be a
   Duchenne patient, a functional or a semi-functional dystrophin is a dystrophin of an
   individual having BMD: typically said dystrophin is able to interact with both actin and the
15 DGC or DAPC, but its central rod shaped domain may be shorter than the one of a wild type
   dystrophin (Monaco et al., 1988). The central rod domain of wild type dystrophin comprises
   24 spectrin-like repeats. For example, a central rod shaped domain of a dystrophin as
   provided herein may comprise 5 to 23, 10 to 22 or 12 to 18 spectrin-like repeats as long as it
   can bind to actin and to DGC.
20 Alleviating one or more symptom(s) of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Becker Muscular
   Dystrophy in an individual using an oligonucleotide of the invention may be assessed by any
   of the following assays: prolongation of time to loss of walking, improvement of muscle
   strength, improvement of the ability to lift weight, improvement of the time taken to rise
   from the floor, improvement in the nine-metre walking time, improvement in the time taken
25 for four-stairs climbing, improvement of the leg function grade, improvement of the
   pulmonary function, improvement of cardiac function, improvement of the quality of life.
   Each of these assays is known to the skilled person. As an example, the publication of
   Manzur et al (2008) gives an extensive explanation of each of these assays. For each of these
   assays, as soon as a detectable improvement or prolongation of a parameter measured in an
30 assay has been found, it will preferably mean that one or more symptoms of Duchenne
   Muscular Dystrophy or Becker Muscular Dystrophy has been alleviated in an individual
   using an oligonucleotide of the invention. Detectable improvement or prolongation is
   preferably a statistically significant improvement or prolongation as described in Hodgetts et
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                       20
   al. (2006). Alternatively, the alleviation of one or more symptom(s) of Duchenne Muscular
   Dystrophy or Becker Muscular Dystrophy may be assessed by measuring an improvement of
   a muscle fiber function, integrity and/or survival. In a preferred method, one or more
   symptom(s) of a DMD or a BMD patient is/are alleviated and/or one or more
 5 characteristic(s) of one or more muscle cells from a DMD or a BMD patient is/are improved.
   Such symptoms or characteristics may be assessed at the cellular, tissue level or on the
   patient self.
                An alleviation of one or more characteristics of a muscle cell from a patient may be
   assessed by any of the following assays on a myogenic cell or muscle cell from a patient:
10 reduced calcium uptake by muscle cells, decreased collagen synthesis, altered morphology,
   altered lipid biosynthesis, decreased oxidative stress, and/or improved muscle fiber function,
   integrity, and/or survival. These parameters are usually assessed using immunofluorescence
   and/or histochemical analyses of cross sections of muscle biopsies.
   The improvement of muscle fiber function, integrity and/or survival may be assessed using at
15 least one of the following assays: a detectable decrease of creatine kinase in blood, a
   detectable decrease of necrosis of muscle fibers in a biopsy cross-section of a muscle
   suspected to be dystrophic, and/or a detectable increase of the homogeneity of the diameter
   of muscle fibers in a biopsy cross-section of a muscle suspected to be dystrophic. Each of
   these assays is known to the skilled person.
20              Creatine kinase may be detected in blood as described in Hodgetts et al. (2006). A
   detectable decrease in creatine kinase may mean a decrease of 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%,
   50%, 60%, 7 0%, 80%, 90% or more compared to the concentration of creatine kinase in a
   same DMD or BMD patient before treatment.
                 A detectable decrease of necrosis of muscle fibers is preferably assessed in a muscle
25 biopsy, more preferably as described in Hodgetts et al. (2006), using biopsy cross-sections.
   A detectable decrease of necrosis may be a decrease of 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%,
   60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or more of the area wherein necrosis has been identified using biopsy
   cross-sections. The decrease is measured by comparison to the necrosis as assessed in a same
   DMD or BMD patient before treatment.
30              A detectable increase of the homogeneity of the diameter of a muscle fiber is
   preferably assessed in a muscle biopsy cross-section, more preferably as described in
   Hodgetts et al. (2006). The increase is measured by comparison to the homogeneity of the
   diameter of a muscle fiber in a same DMD or BMD patient before treatment
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                       21
                Preferably, an oligonucleotide of the invention provides said individual with a
   functional or a semi-functional dystrophin protein (typically in the case of DMD) and is able
   to, for at least in part decrease the production of an aberrant dystrophin protein in said
 5 individual (typically in the case of BMD).
                Decreasing the production of an aberrant dystrophin mRNA, or aberrant dystrophin
   protein, preferably means that 90%, 80%, 7 0%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5 % or less
   of the initial amount of aberrant dystrophin mRNA, or aberrant dystrophin protein, is still
10 detectable by RT PCR (mRNA) or immunofluorescence or western blot analysis (protein).
   An aberrant dystrophin mRNA or protein is also referred to herein as a less functional
   (compared to a wild type functional dystrophin protein as earlier defined herein) or a non
   functional dystrophin mRNA or protein. A non functional dystrophin protein is preferably a
   dystrophin protein which is not able to bind actin and/or members of the DGC protein
15 complex. A non-functional dystrophin protein or dystrophin mRNA does typically not have,
   or does not encode a dystrophin protein with an intact C-terminus of the protein. The
   detection of a functional or semi-functional dystrophin mRNA or protein may be done as for
   an aberrant dystrophin mRNA or protein.
                Once a DMD patient is provided with a functional or a semi-functional dystrophin
20 protein, at least part of the cause of DMD is taken away. Hence, it would then be expected
   that the symptoms of DMD are at least partly alleviated. The enhanced skipping frequency
   also increases the level of functional or a semi-functional dystrophin protein produced in a
   muscle cell of a DMD or BMD individual.
25              Exons contain one or more specific sequences comprising splicing regulatory
   elements which have shown to be effective targets for antisense oligonucleotides (Aartsma
   Rus et al, 2010). One embodiment therefore provides an oligonucleotide for providing said
   individual with a functional or semi-functional dystrophin protein wherein said
   oligonucleotide comprises a sequence which is specifically binding, targeting and/or
30 hybridizing with and/or blocking these splicing regulatory elements in a dystrophin pre
   mRNA exon. Such oligonucleotide is also able to bind and/or target and/or hybridize with
   and/or block these splicing regulatory elements in a dystrophin pre-mRNA. In addition,
   since an exon will only be included into the resulting mRNA when both the splice sites are
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                       22
   recognized by the spliceosome complex, splice sites are other targets for an oligonucleotide
   of the invention. One embodiment therefore provides an oligonucleotide for providing said
   individual with a functional or semi-functional dystrophin protein wherein said
   oligonucleotide comprises a sequence which is specifically binding and/or targeting and/or
 5 hybridizing with, and/or blocking one of or both the splice sites of an exon of a dystrophin
   pre-mRNA. Such oligonucleotide is also able to bind and/or target, hybridize with and/or
   block one or both of these splice sites of an exon of a dystrophin pre-mRNA. Usually a splice
   site of an exon comprises 1, 2, 3, or more nucleotides present in said exon and 1, 2, 3, or
   more nucleotides present in an adjacent or neighboring intron. In one embodiment an
10 oligonucleotide is used which is solely binding to and/or targeting and/or hybridizing with an
   intron region of a dystrophin pre-mRNA. Such oligonucleotide is able to bind and/or able to
   target and/or able to hybridize with said intron region. This is however not necessary: it is
   also possible to use an oligonucleotide which targets and/or binds and/or hybridizes with
   and/or is able to target and/or is able to binds and/or is able to hybridizes with an intron
15 specific sequence as well as exon-specific sequence. Of course, an oligonucleotide is not
   necessarily binding to and/or targeting and/or hybridizing with the entire sequence of a
   dystrophin exon or intron. Such oligonucleotide is also not necessary able to bind to and/or
   able to target and/or able to hybridize with the entire sequence of a dystrophin exon or intron.
   Oligonucleotides which are specifically binding, targeting and/or hybridizing with and/or
20 which are specifically able to bind and/or able to target and/or able to hybridize part of such
   exon or intron are preferred. An oligonucleotide is used, said oligonucleotide is preferably
   reverse complementary to, and/or binds to, and/or targets and/or hybridizes with and/or is
   able to bind to and/or is able to target and/or is able to hybridize with at least part of a
   dystrophin exon and/or intron, said part having at least 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
25 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, or 33 nucleotides.
                Splicing of a dystrophin pre-mRNA occurs via two sequential transesterification
   reactions involving an intronic branch point and a splice site of an adjacent intron. Hence, an
   oligonucleotide is used for exon skipping, wherein said oligonucleotide comprises a sequence
   which is binding to and/or targeting and/or hybridizing with or is able to bind to and/or is
30 able to target and/or is able to hybridize with such branch point and/or splice site. Preferably
   said splice site and/or branch point is present in a dystrophin pre-mRNA.
                Since splice sites contain consensus sequences, the use of an oligonucleotide part or a
   functional equivalent thereof comprising a sequence which is capable of binding to and/or
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                       23
   able to bind to and/or able to target and/or able to hybridize and/or binds to and/or target
   and/or hybridizes with a splice site involves the risk of promiscuous hybridization.
   Hybridization of said oligonucleotide to other splice sites than the sites of the exon to be
   skipped could easily interfere with the accuracy of the splicing process. To overcome these
 5 and other potential problems related to the use of an oligonucleotide which is binding and/or
   hybridizing and/or targeting and/or is able to bind to and/or is able to target and/or is able to
   hybridize a splice site, most preferred embodiment provides an oligonucleotide for providing
   said individual with a functional or a semi-functional dystrophin protein, wherein said
   oligonucleotide or a functional equivalent thereof, binding to and/or hybridizing with and/or
10 targeting and/or is able to bind to and/or is able to hybridize and/or is able to target a specific
   part of a dystrophin pre-mRNA exon. Exons contain coding sequences which are typically
   more specific that the non-coding intron sequences. Preferably, said oligonucleotide binding
   to and/or hybridizing with and/or targeting and/or able to bind to and/or able to hybridize
   with and/or able to target a specific part of a dystrophin pre-mRNA exon is capable of
15 specifically blocking, interfering and/or inhibiting a splicing regulatory sequence and/or
   structure of the anticpated exon(s) in said dystrophin pre-mRNA. Interfering with such
   splicing regulatory sequence and/or structure has the advantage that such elements are
   located within the exon. The risk for sequence-related off-target effects is therefore limited.
   By providing an oligonucleotide for the interior of the exon to be skipped, it is possible to
20 mask the exon from the splicing apparatus. The failure of the splicing apparatus to recognize
   the exon to be skipped thus leads to exclusion of the exon from the final mRNA. This
   embodiment does not interfere directly with the enzymatic process of the splicing machinery
   (the joining of the exons). It is thought that this allows the method to be more specific and/or
   reliable. It has been found that an oligonucleotide capable of binding to and/or able to bind to
25 and/or able to target and/or able to hybridize and/or binding to and/or hybridizing with and/or
   targeting an exon at any point may be able to induce the skipping of said exon.
                Within the context of the invention, an oligonucleotide of the invention may comprise
   a functional equivalent or an equivalent of an oligonucleotide. A functional equivalent or an
   equivalent of an oligonucleotide preferably means an oligonucleotide as defined herein
30 wherein one or more nucleotides have been substituted and wherein an activity of said
   functional equivalent or equivalent is retained to at least some extent. Preferably, an activity
   of said oligonucleotide comprising a functional equivalent or equivalent of an
   oligonucleotide is providing a functional or a semi-functional dystrophin protein. Said
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                            24
   activity of said oligonucleotide comprising a functional equivalent or an equivalent of an
   oligonucleotide is therefore preferably assessed by quantifying the amount of a functional or
   a semi-functional dystrophin protein. A functional or semi-functional dystrophin is herein
   preferably defined as being a dystrophin able to bind actin and members of the DGC (or
 5 DAPC) protein complex. The assessment of said activity of said functional equivalent of an
   oligonucleotide is preferably done by RT-PCR and sequencing (on RNA level; for detection
   of specific exon skipping), or by immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses (on protein
   level: for detection of protein restoration). Said activity is preferably retained to at least some
   extent when it represents at least 50%, or at least 60%, or at least 7 0% or at least 80% or at
10 least 90% or at least 95% or more of corresponding activity of said oligonucleotide the
   functional equivalent or equivalent derives from. Throughout this application, when the word
   oligonucleotide is used it may be replaced by a functional equivalent thereof or an equivalent
   thereof as defined herein. In an embodiment, an equivalent or a functional equivalent of an
   oligonucleotide of the invention comprises a modification. Throughout this application, when
15 the word oligonucleotide is used it may be replaced by an antisense oligonucleotide as
   defined herein unless otherwise indicated.
                Hence, the use of an oligonucleotide or a functional equivalent thereof, or an
   equivalent thereof comprising a 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA monomer or consisting
20 of 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA and comprising a 5-methylpyrimidine (i.e. a 5
   methylcytosine                 and/or a 5-methyluracil) and/or a 2,6-diaminopurine      base and being
   represented by a nucleotide sequence comprising or consisting of a sequence which is reverse
   complementary to, and/or binds to and/or targets and/or hybridizes and/or is able to bind to
   and/or is able to target and/or is able to hybridize with a dystrophin pre-mRNA exon is
25 assumed to have a positive effect on at least one of the parameters of said oligonucleotide, as
   has already been defined herein, when compared to their counterparts which do not comprise
   any 5-methylcytosine,                 5-methyluracil and 2,6-diaminopurine (i.e. so called non-modified
   oligonucleotide) as indicated earlier herein, and is therefore assumed to exhibit an improved
   therapeutic result in a DMD or a BMD cell of a patient and/or in a DMD or a BMD patient.
30 Such a therapeutic result may be characterized by:
                - alleviating one or more symptom(s) of DMD or BMD and/or
                - alleviating one or more characteristics of a muscle cell from a patient and/or
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                       25
                - providing said individual with a functional or semi-functional dystrophin protein
   and/or
                - at least in part decreasing the production of an aberrant dystrophin protein in said
   individual.
 5 Each of these features has already been defined herein.
             Preferably, an oligonucleotide is represented by a nucleotide sequence which comprises
   or consists of a sequence which is binding to and/or targeting and/or being reverse
   complementary to and/or is hybridizing with and/or which is able to bind to and/or is able to
10 target and/or is able to hybridize with and/or is reverse complementary to at least a part of
   dystrophin pre-mRNA exons 44 to 55, said oligonucleotide having a length of at least 10

    16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, or 33 nucleotides.
   Throughout the invention, said sequence representing the oligonucleotide may also be called
15 a base or a nucleotide sequence.
                Preferably, an oligonucleotide of the invention is represented by a nucleotide
   sequence or a base sequence comprising or consisting of a sequence that is capable of
   binding to, and/or targeting and/or being reverse complementary to and/or hybridizing with
20 and/or being able to bind to and/or being able to hybridize with and/or being able to target a
   part of an exon of dystrophin pre-mRNA. Said binding or targeted part may be at least 50%
   of the length of the oligonucleotide of the invention, or at least 60%, or at least 70%, or at
   least 80%, or at least 90% or at least 95%, or 98% and up to 100%. An oligonucleotide may
   be represented by a nucleotide or a base sequence, said nucleotide or base sequence
25 comprising a sequence that binds and/ortargets and/or is reverse complementary to and/or
   hybridizes with and/or is able to bind to and/or is able to hybridize with and/or is able to
   target at least a part of an exon selected from the group consisting of exons 44 to 55 of
   dystrophin pre-mRNA as defined herein and additional flanking sequences. In a more
   preferred embodiment, the length of said binding or targeted part of said oligonucleotide is of
30 at least 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32,
   or 33 nucleotides. Several types of flanking sequences may be used. Preferably, flanking
   sequences are used to modify the binding of a protein to said oligonucleotide, or to modify a
   thermodynamic property of said oligonucleotide, more preferably to modify target RNA

   binding affinity. In another preferred embodiment, additional flanking sequences are reverse
   complementary to sequences of the dystrophin pre-mRNA which are not present in said exon.
   Such flanking sequences are preferably capable of binding to and/or targeting sequences
   comprising or consisting of the branchpoint and/or the splice site acceptor or donor
 5 consensus sequences of said exon. In a preferred embodiment, such flanking sequences are
   capable of binding to and/or targeting sequences comprising or consisting of sequences of an
   intron of the dystrophin pre-mRNA which is adjacent to said exon.
                One preferred embodiment provides an oligonucleotide for providing said individual
10 with a functional or a semi-functional dystrophin protein, said oligonucleotide or a functional
   equivalent thereof or an equivalent thereof, being represented by a sequence or a base
   sequence which comprises:
   - a sequence which binds, is able to bind, targets, hybridizes or is reverse complementary to a
   region of a dystrophin pre-mRNA exon that is hybridized to another part of a dystrophin
15 pre-mRNA exon (closed structure), and
   - a sequence which binds and/or targets and/or hybridizes and/or is reverse complementary to
   and/or is able to bind and/or is able to target and/or is able to hybridize with a region of a
   dystrophin pre-mRNA exon that is not hybridized in said dystrophin pre-mRNA (open
   structure).
20              For this embodiment, reference is made to the WO 2004/083446 patent application.
   RNA molecules exhibit strong secondary structures, mostly due to base pairing of
   complementary or partly complementary stretches within the same RNA. It has long since
   been thought that structures in the RNA play a role in the function of the RNA. Without
   being bound by theory, it is believed that the secondary structure of the RNA of an exon
25 plays a role in structuring the splicing process. Through its structure, an exon is recognized as
   a part that needs to be included in the mRNA. In an embodiment, an oligonucleotide is
   capable of interfering with the structure of the exon and therefore capable of interfering with
   the splicing apparatus of said exon, masking the exon from the splicing apparatus and thereby
   inducing the skipping of said exon. It has been found that many oligonucleotides indeed
30 comprise this capacity, some more efficient than others. Without being bound by theory it is
   thought that the overlap with an open structure improves the invasion efficiency of the
   oligonucleotide (i.e. increases the efficiency with which the oligonucleotide can enter the
   structure), whereas the overlap with the closed structure subsequently increases the efficiency
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                      27
   of interfering with the secondary structure of the RNA of the exon. It is found that the length
   of the partial reverse complementarity to both the closed and the open structure is not
   extremely restricted. We have observed high efficiencies with compounds comprising
   oligonucleotides with variable lengths of reverse complementarity in either structure. The
 5 term (reverse) complementarity is used herein to refer to a stretch of nucleic acids that can
   hybridise to another stretch of nucleic acids under physiological conditions. Hybridization
   conditions are later defined herein. It is thus not absolutely required that all the bases in the
   region of complementarity are capable of pairing with bases in the opposing strand. For
   instance, when designing an antisense oligonucleotide, one may want to incorporate for
10 instance a residue that does not base pair with the base on the complementary strand.
   Mismatches may to some extent be allowed, if under the circumstances in the cell, the stretch
   of nucleotides is capable of hybridizing to the complementary part.
                 In a preferred embodiment a reverse complementary part of an antisense
   oligonucleotide (either to said open or to said closed structure) comprises at least 3, and more
15 preferably at least 4 consecutive nucleotides. The reverse complementary regions are
   preferably designed such that, when combined, they are specific for an exon in a pre-mRNA.
   Such specificity may be created with various lengths of reverse complementary regions as
   this depends on the actual sequences in other (pre-)mRNA in the system. The risk that also
   one or more other pre-mRNA will be able to hybridise to an oligonucleotide decreases with
20 increasing size of said oligonucleotide. It is clear that an antisense oligonucleotide
   comprising mismatches in the region of reverse complementarity but that retain the capacity
   to hybridise to the targeted region(s) in the pre-mRNA, can be used in the present invention.
   However, preferably at least the reverse complementary parts do not comprise such
   mismatches as these typically have a higher efficiency and a higher specificity than
25 oligonucleotide having such mismatches in one or more reverse complementary regions. It is
   thought that higher hybridisation strengths, (i.e. increasing number of interactions with the
   opposing strand) are favourable in increasing the efficiency of the process of interfering with
   the splicing machinery of the system. Preferably, the reverse complementarity is from 90 to
    100%. In general this allows for 1 or 2 mismatch(es) in an oligonucleotide of 20 nucleotides
30 or I to 4 mismatches in an oligonucleotide of 40 nucleotides. Therefore, we may have 1, 2, 3,
   4, 5 mismatches in an oligonucleotide of 10 to 50 nucleotides. Preferably, 0, 1 or 2
   mismatches are present in an oligonucleotide of 10 to 50 nucleotides.

                                                        28
                The structure (i.e. open and closed structures) is best analyzed in the context of the
   pre-mRNA wherein the exon resides. Such structure may be analyzed in the actual RNA.
   However, it is currently possible to predict the secondary structure of an RNA molecule (at
   lowest energy costs) quite well using structure-modeling programs. Non-limiting examples of
 5 a suitable program are RNA structure version 4.5 or RNA fold version 3.5 (Zuker et al.,
   2003). A person skilled in the art will be able to predict, with suitable reproducibility, a likely
   structure of an exon, given a nucleotide sequence. Best predictions are obtained when
   providing such modeling programs with both said exon and flanking intron sequences. It is
   typically not necessary to model the structure of the entire pre-mRNA.
10              The open and closed structure to which the oligonucleotide of an oligonucleotide is
   directed, are preferably adjacent to one another. It is thought that in this way the annealing of
   the oligonucleotide to the open structure induces opening of the closed structure whereupon
   annealing progresses into this closed structure. Through this action the previously closed
   structure assumes a different conformation. However, when potential (cryptic) splice
15 acceptor and/or donor sequences are present within the targeted exon, occasionally a new
   exon inclusion signal or splicing regulatory sequence, element, structure, or signal is
   generated defining a different (neo) exon, i.e. with a different 5' end, a different 3' end, or
   both. This type of activity is within the scope of the present invention as the targeted exon is
   excluded from the mRNA. The presence of a new exon, containing part of the targeted exon,
20 in the mRNA does not alter the fact that the targeted exon, as such, is excluded. The inclusion
   of a neo-exon can be seen as a side effect which occurs only occasionally. There are two
   possibilities when exon skipping is used to restore (part of) an open reading frame of
   dystrophin that is disrupted as a result of a mutation. One is that the neo-exon is functional in
   the restoration of the reading frame, whereas in the other case the reading frame is not
25 restored. When selecting a compound comprising an oligonucleotide for restoring dystrophin
   reading frames by means of exon-skipping it is of course clear that under these conditions
   only those compounds comprising those oligonucleotide are selected that indeed result in
   exon-skipping that restores the dystrophin open reading frame, with or without a neo-exon.
30              Further provided is an oligonucleotide for providing said individual with a functional
   or a semi-functional dystrophin protein, wherein said oligonucleotide or a functional
   equivalent thereof or an equivalent thereof comprises a 2'-0-methyl phosphorothioate RNA
   monomer or consists of 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA and comprises a 5
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                     29
   methylpyrimidine (i.e. a 5-methylcytosine, and/or a 5-methyluracil) and/or a 2,6
   diaminopurine base and is represented by a nucleotide or a base sequence comprising a
   sequence that is reverse complementary to and/or binds to and/or targets and/or hybridizes
   with and/or is able to bind to and/or is able to target and/or is able to hybridize with a
 5 binding site for a serine-arginine (SR) protein in RNA of an exon of a dystrophin pre-mRNA.
   In WO 2006/112705 patent application we have disclosed the presence of a correlation
   between the effectivity of an exon-intemal antisense oligonucleotide in inducing exon
   skipping and the presence of a (for example by ESEfinder) predicted SR binding site in the
   target pre-mRNA site of said AON. Therefore, in one embodiment an oligonucleotide is
10 generated comprising determining a (putative) binding site for an SR (Ser-Arg) protein in
   RNA of a dystrophin exon and producing a corresponding compound comprising
   oligonucleotide that is reverse complementary to and/or binds to and/or targets and/or
   hybridizes with and/or is able to bind and/or is able to target and/or is able to hybridize with
   said RNA and that at least partly overlaps said (putative) binding site. The term "at least
15 partly overlaps" is defined herein as to comprise an overlap of only a single nucleotide of an
   SR binding site as well as multiple nucleotides of said binding site as well as a complete
   overlap of said binding site. This embodiment preferably further comprises determining from
   a secondary structure of said RNA, a region that is hybridized to another part of said RNA
   (closed structure) and a region that is not hybridized in said structure (open structure), and
20 subsequently generating an oligonucleotide that at least partly overlaps said (putative)
   binding site and that overlaps at least part of said closed structure and overlaps at least part of
   said open structure. In this way we increase the chance of obtaining an oligonucleotide that is
   capable of interfering with the exon inclusion from the pre-mRNA into mRNA. It is possible
   that a first selected SR-binding region does not have the requested open-closed structure in
25 which case another (second) SR protein binding site is selected which is then subsequently
   tested for the presence of an open-closed structure. This process is continued until a sequence
   is identified which contains an SR protein binding site as well as a(n) (partly overlapping)
   open-closed structure. This sequence is then used to design an oligonucleotide which is
   reverse complementary to said sequence.
30              Such a method for generating an antisense oligonucleotide is also performed by
   reversing the described order, i.e. first generating an oligonucleotide comprising determining,
   from a secondary structure of RNA from a dystrophin exon, a region that assumes a structure
   that is hybridised to another part of said RNA (closed structure) and a region that is not
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                             30
   hybridised in said structure (open structure), and subsequently generating an oligonucleotide,
   of which at least a part of said oligonucleotide is reverse complementary to said closed
   structure and of which at least another part of said oligonucleotide is reverse complementary
   to said open structure. This is then followed by determining whether an SR protein binding
 5 site at least overlaps with said open/closed structure. In this way the method of WO
   2004/083446 is improved. In yet another embodiment the selections are performed
   simultaneously.
                Without wishing to be bound by any theory it is currently thought that use of an
10 oligonucleotide directed to or targeting an SR protein binding site results in (at least partly)
   impairing the binding of an SR protein to the binding site of an SR protein which results in
   disrupted or impaired splicing.
                              Preferably, an open/closed structure and an SR protein binding site partly
   overlap and even more preferred an open/closed structure completely overlaps an SR protein
15 binding site or an SR protein binding site completely overlaps an open/closed structure. This
   allows for an improved disruption of exon inclusion.
   Besides consensus splice site and branchpoint intronic sequences, many (if not all) exons
   contain splicing regulatory sequences such as but not limited to exonic splicing enhancer
20 (ESE) sequences to facilitate the recognition of genuine splice sites by the spliceosome
   (Cartegni et al., 2002; and Cartegni et al., 2003). A subgroup of splicing factors, called the
   SR proteins, can bind to these ESEs and recruit other splicing factors, such as Ul and U2AF
   to (weakly defined) splice sites. The binding sites of the four most abundant SR proteins
   (SF2/ASF, SC35, SRp40 and SRp55) have been analyzed in detail and these results are
25 implemented in ESEfinder, a web source that predicts potential binding sites for these SR
   proteins (Cartegni et al., 2002; and Cartegni et al., 2003). There is a correlation between the
   effectiveness of an oligonucleotide and the presence/absence of an SF2/ASF, SC35 and
   SRp40 binding site in the site targeted by said oligonucleotide. In a preferred embodiment,
   the invention thus provides an oligonucleotide as described above, which is reverse
30 complementary to and/or targets and/or binds to and/or hybridizes with and/or is able to
   target and/or is able to bind and/or is able to hybridize with a binding site for a SR protein.
   Preferably, said SR protein is SF2/ASF or SC35 or SRp40.

                                                    31
                In one embodiment a DMD patient is provided with a functional or a semi-functional
   dystrophin protein by using an oligonucleotide or a functional equivalent thereof or an
   equivalent thereof comprising a 2'-0-methyl phosphorothioate RNA monomer or consisting
   of 2'-0-methyl phosphorothioate RNA and comprising a 5-methylpyrimidine (i.e. a 5
 5 methylcytosine, and/or a 5-methyluracil) and/or a 2,6-diaminopurine base and being capable
   of specifically binding or targeting and/or being able to bind and/or being able to target
   and/or being able to hybridize a regulatory RNA sequence which is required for the correct
   splicing of a dystrophin exon in a transcript. Several cis-acting RNA sequences are required
   for the correct splicing of exons in a transcript. In particular, elements such as an exonic
10 splicing enhancer (ESE), an exon recognition sequence (ERS), and/or an exonic splicing
   silencer (ESS) are identified to regulate specific and efficient splicing of constitutive and
   alternative exons. Using a sequence-specific antisense oligonucleotide or a base-specific
   antisense oligonucleotide (AON) that binds to and/or targets and/or is reverse complementary
   to and/or hybridizes with and/or is able to bind and/or is able to hybridize with and/or is able
15 to target the elements, their regulatory function is disturbed so that the exon is skipped, as
   shown for DMD. Hence, in one preferred embodiment, an oligonucleotide or a functional
   equivalent thereof or an equivalent thereof is used which is reverse complementary to and/or
   binds to and/or targets and/or hybridizes with and/or is able to bind to and/or is able to target
   and/or is able to hybridize with an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), an exon recognition
20 sequence (ERS), and/or an exonic splicing silencer (ESS).
   In a preferred embodiment, an oligonucleotide of the invention comprises or consists of a
   sequence or a base sequence that is reverse complementary to and/or binds to and/or targets
   and/or hybridizes with and/or is able to bind to and/or is able to target and/or is able to
25 hybridize with at least a part of dystrophin pre-mRNA exon 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52,
   53, 54, or 55, said part having at least 10 nucleotides. However, said part may also have at
   least 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32, or, 33
   nucleotides. For the dystrophin exons identified above, we provide the stretch of nucleotides
   (SEQ ID NO: 2 to 13 identified below) of said exon to which an oligonucleotide binds to
30 and/or is reverse complementary to and/or targets and/or hybridizes with and/or is able to
   bind to and/or is able to target and/or is able to hybridize with.

 5 Definitions
   Throughout the application, the word "binds", "targets", "hybridizes" could be used
   interchangeably when used in the context of an antisense oligonucleotide which is reverse
   complementary to a part of a pre-mRNA as identified herein.
10 In addition, throughout the application, the expression "able to bind", "able to target", "able
   to hybridize" could be used interchangeably when used in the context of an antisense
   oligonucleotide which is reverse complementary to a part of a pre-mRNA as identified herein

   hybridize with said part of said pre-mRNA..
15
   As used herein, "hybridization" refers to the pairing of complementary oligomeric
   compounds (e.g., an antisense compound and its target nucleic acid). While not limited to a
   particular mechanism, the most common mechanism of pairing involves hydrogen bonding,
   which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between
20 complementary nucleoside or nucleotide bases (nucleobases). For example, the natural base
   adenine is nucleobase complementary to the natural nucleobases thymine and uracil which
   pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. The natural base guanine is nucleobase
   complementary to the natural bases cytosine and 5-methylcytosine. Hybridization can occur
   under varying circumstances.
25 As used herein, "specifically hybridizes" refers to the ability of an oligomeric compound to
   hybridize to one nucleic acid site with greater affinity than it hybridizes to another nucleic
   acid site. In certain embodiments, an anti sense oligonucleotide specifically hybridizes to
   more than one target site.
   In the context of the invention, "hybridizes" is used under physiological conditions in a cell,

   position of hydrogen bonding between the oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid is
   considered to be complementary at that nucleobase pair. Nucleobases comprising certain
   modifications may maintain the ability to pair with a counterpart nucleobase and thus, are
   still capable of nucleobase complementarity.
10 As used herein, "non-complementary" in reference to nucleobases refers to a pair of
   nucleobases that do not form hydrogen bonds with one another or otherwise support
   hybridization.
   As used herein, "complementary" in reference to linked nucleosides, oligonucleotides, or
   nucleic acids, refers to the capacity of an oligomeric compound to hybridize to another
15 oligomeric compound or nucleic acid through nucleobase complementarity. In certain
   embodiments, an antisense compound and its target are complementary to each other when a
   sufficient number of corresponding positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleobases
   that can bond with each other to allow stable association between the anti sense compound
   and the target. One skilled in the art recognizes that the inclusion of mismatches is possible
20 without eliminating the ability of the oligomeric compounds to remain in association.
   Therefore, described herein are antisense compounds that may comprise up to about 20%
   nucleotides that are mismatched (i.e., are not nucleobase complementary to the corresponding
   nucleotides of the target). Preferably the antisense compounds contain no more than about
    15%, more preferably not more than about 10%, most preferably not more than 5% or no
25 mismatches. The remaining nucleotides are nucleobase complementary or otherwise do not
   disrupt hybridization (e.g., universal bases). One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize
   the compounds provided herein are at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at
   least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or 100% complementary to a target
   nucleic acid.

   (inhibition or reduction) in gene expression. As a further example, modulation of expression
   can include perturbing splice site selection of pre-mRNA processing, resulting in a change in
   the amount of a particular splice-variant present compared to conditions that were not
   perturbed. As a further example, modulation includes perturbing translation of a protein.
 5 As used herein, "motif' refers to a pattern of modifications in an oligomeric compound or a
   region thereof. Motifs may be defined by modifications at certain nucleosides and/or at
   certain linking groups of an oligomeric compound.
   As used herein, "nucleoside motif' refers to a pattern of nucleoside modifications in an
   oligomeric compound or a region thereof. The linkages of such an oligomeric compound may
10 be modified or unmodified. Unless otherwise indicated, motifs herein describing only
   nucleosides are intended to be nucleoside motifs. Thus, in such instances, the linkages are not
   limited.
   As used herein, "linkage motif' refers to a pattern of linkage modifications in an oligomeric
   compound or region thereof. The nucleosides of such an oligomeric compound may be
15 modified or unmodified. Unless otherwise indicated, motifs herein describing only linkages
   are intended to be linkage motifs. Thus, in such instances, the nucleosides are not limited.
   As used herein, "the same modifications" refer to modifications relative to naturally
   occurring molecules that are the same as one another, including absence of modifications.
   Thus, for example, two unmodified DNA nucleoside have "the same modification," even
20 though the DNA nucleoside is unmodified.
   As used herein, "type of modification" in reference to a nucleoside or a nucleoside of a "type"
   refers to the modification of a nucleoside and includes modified and unmodified nucleosides.
   Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, a "nucleoside having a modification of a first type"
   may be an unmodified nucleoside.
25 As used herein, "separate regions" refers to a portion of an oligomeric compound wherein the
   nucleosides and internucleoside       linkages within the region all comprise the same
   modifications; and the nucleosides and/or the intemucleoside linkages of any neighboring
   portions include at least one different modification.
   As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts of active compounds that
30 retain the desired biological activity of the active compound and do not impart undesired
   toxicological effects thereto.

   As used herein, the term "independently" means that each occurrence of a repetitive variable
   within a claimed oligonucleotide is selected independent of one another. For example, each
   repetitive variable can be selected so that (i) each of the repetitive variables are the same, (ii)
   two or more are the same, or (iii) each of the repetitive variables can be different.

   described herein are present to a recursive degree.
   In this context, "recursive substituent" means that a substituent may recite another instance of
   itself. Because of the recursive nature of such substituents, theoretically, a large number may
   be present in any given claim. One of ordinary skill in the art of medicinal chemistry and

   by the desired properties of the compound intended. Such properties include, by way of
   example and not limitation, physical properties such as molecular weight, solubility or log P,
   application properties such as activity against the intended target and practical properties
   such as ease of synthesis.

   The terms "stable compound" and "stable structure" as used herein are meant to indicate a
25 compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a
   reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. Only stable
   compounds are contemplated herein.
   As used herein, a zero (0) in a range indicating number of a particular unit means that the unit
   may be absent. For example, an oligomeric compound comprising 0-2 regions of a particular
30 motif means that the oligomeric compound may comprise one or two such regions having the
   particular motif, or the oligomeric compound may not have any regions having the particular
   motif. In instances where an internal portion of a molecule is absent, the portions flanking the

   absent portion are bound directly to one another. Likewise, the term "none" as used herein,
   indicates that a certain feature is not present.
   As used herein, "analogue" or "derivative" means either a compound or moiety similar in
   structure but different in respect to elemental composition from the parent compound
 5 regardless of how the compound is made. For example, an analogue or derivative compound
   does not need to be made from the parent compound as a chemical starting material.
   In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the context
   requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word "comprise" or
10 variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify
   the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further
   features in various embodiments of the invention.

   synthesizer (GE/AKTA Oligopilot), through standard phosphoramidite protocols, or obtained
   from commercial suppliers, in 40nmol-4.5mmol          synthesis scale. Prosensa-synthesized
   oligonucleotides were cleaved and deprotected in a two step sequence (DIEA followed by
25 conc. NH 40H treatment), purified by HPLC and dissolved in water and an excess of NaCl
   was added to exchange ions. After evaporation, compounds were redissolved in water,
   desalted by FPLC or ultrafiltration and lyophilized. Mass spectrometry confirmed the identity
   of all compounds, and purity (determined by UPLC) was found acceptable for all compounds
   (>75-80%); compounds obtained from commercial sources were used as received: PS399
30 (ChemGenes, ipmol synthesis scale, used as received), PS1317, PS1318, and PS1319

   transfection experiments described herein, 50 pM working solutions of the AONs were
 5 prepared in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). For the whole blood cytokine release assays in
   this example, the concentrations of the stock solutions (prepared in DNase/RNase-free
   distilled water (Invitrogen)) varied: PS232 (8.75 mg/mL), PS534 (7.02 mg/mL), PS648 (8.55
   mg/mL), PS653 (8.12 mg/mL).
10 Transfection and RT-PCR analysis
   Differentiated human healthy control muscle cells (myotubes) were transfected in 6-wells
   plates with a triplo AON concentration series of 0-100-200-400 nM (Fig. la, PS229L/PS524,
   SEQ ID NO:91/92) or 0-50-100-200-400-800 nM (Fig. lb, PS220/PS399, SEQ ID NO:
    101/200)               or       with    an   in   duplo     concentration   of   400    nM     (Fig.    Ic,
15 PS524/PS1317/PS1318/PS1319,                      SEQ ID NO:92/217/218/219),       according to non-GLP
   standard operating procedures. For transfection polyethylenimine (ExGen500, Fermentas)
   was used (2 pl per pg AON, in 0.15M NaCl). Aforementioned transfection procedures were
   adapted from previously reported material and methods (Aartsma-Rus et al., 2003). At 24 hrs
   after transfection, RNA was isolated and analyzed by RT-PCR. Briefly, to generate
20 dystrophin-specific cDNA, a DMD gene specific reverse primer in exon 47 (PS220/PS399)
   or exon 55 (PS229L/PS524/PS1317/PS1318/PS1319)                        was used in the reverse transcriptase
   (RT) reaction on 1000 ng input RNA. The PCR analysis was subsequently done on 3 Pl of
   dystrophin cDNA for each sample, and included a first and nested PCR using DMD gene
   specific            primers           in   exons   flanking     exon    45   (PS220/PS399)         or    53
25 (PS229L/PS524/PS1317/PS1318/PS1319).                      The RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis were
   performed according to non-GLP standard operating procedures as described (Aartsma-Rus
   et al., 2003). RT-PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (2% agarose gels). The
   resulting          RT-PCR fragments             were  quantified through DNA      Lab-on-a-Chip    analysis
   (Agilent). The data was processed by "Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer" software and Excel 2007.
30 The ratio of the smaller transcript product (containing the exon 45(PS220/PS399) or 53 skip
   (PS229L/PS524/PS1317/PS1318/PS1319))                      to the total amount of transcript products was
   assessed (representing the exon 45 or 53 skipping efficiencies in percentages) and directly
   compared to that in non-transfected cells.

   Pharmacokinetic study in wild type and mdx mice
   Mdx (C57Bl/10ScSn-Dmd"d/J) and wild-type (C57Bl/10ScSnJ) mice at 5 weeks of age were
   obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Maine USA). The AONs (PS229L/PS524 corresponding
 5 to SEQ ID NO: 91/92, PS531/PS652 corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 137/185) were
   administered in physiological saline at a dose of 100mg/kg by subcutaneous injections three
   times per week for two weeks. To determine the plasma profile of the AONs, plasma samples
   were taken from 2 animals per time-point (per AON group) at the following times for the
   animals: 15 min, 1h, 2h, 6h and 24 hours after dosing. To obtain plasma, venous whole blood
10 was collected into Li-Heparin tubes, centrifuged and kept at -80'C until analysis. For
   distribution analysis 7 organs (heart, kidney cortex, liver, diaphragm, gastrocnemius,
   quadriceps & triceps) were harvested upon sacrifice of the animals. The tissues were snap
   frozen and stored at -80'C until analysis.
15 AON hybridisation assay
   To determine the concentration of the AONs (PS229L/PS524 corresponding to SEQ ID NO:
   91/92, PS531/PS652 corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 137/185) in plasma and tissue an AON
   hybridization assay was used, which is based on the assay described by Yu et al., 2002. For
   the tissue distribution analysis, tissues were homogenized, using a MagNaLyzer (Roche) to a
20 concentration of 60 mg/ml in protK buffer (100 mmol/l Tris-HCl pH8.5, 200 mmol/l NaCl, 5
   mmol/l EDTA, 0.2% SDS) containing 2 mg/ml proteinase K, followed by a 2 hours
   incubation (liver) or 4 hours incubation (all other organs) in a rotating hybridization oven at
   55'C and then stored -20'C until use. All tissue homogenates and calibration curves were
   diluted (fit to criteria of the assay) in 60 times diluted pooled mdx control tissue homogenate
25 (kidney, liver, several muscle groups). A template probe specific for each AON (5'
   gaatagacg-anti-AON-biotin 3', DNA phosphate oligonucleotide) and a ligation probe (p
   cgtctattc-DIG DNA phosphate oligonucleotide) were used in the hybridization assay. The
   homogenates were incubated for 1 h at 37'C with template probe (50nmol/l) and the
   hybridized samples were transferred to streptavidin coated 96-well plates and incubated for
30 30 min at 37 0 C. Subsequently, the plate was washed 4 times and the digoxigenin-labeled
   ligation (2 nmol/1) was added and incubated for 30 min at ambient temperature. The DIG
   label was detected using an anti-DIG-POD (1:7,500 - 1:30,000; Roche Diagnostics), which
   was visualized with a 3,3', 5,5' -tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma Aldrich, the
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                133
   Netherlands), and the reaction was stopped using an acidic solution (Sigma Aldrich). The
   absorption was measured at 450 nm using a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader (Beun de
   Ronde, Abcoude, The Netherlands). Plasma samples were analyzed according to the same
   protocol, using 100 times diluted pooled mdx plasma.

   Whole blood cytokine release assay
   For the detection of possible cytokine stimulation induced by selected AONs (PS232/PS648
   corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 119/201 and PS534/PS653 corresponding to SEQ ID NO:
    139/192) whole blood (anticoagulant       CPD)     from healthy human volunteers        was
10 used. Varying AON concentrations (ranging from 0 to 50 pg/ml, in a dilution of
   approximately 1:0.01 (v/v)) were added to the blood and the samples were incubated for 4
   hours at 37'C under 5% CO 2 atmosphere. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at
   3200xg for 15 minutes at 4'C and plasma supernatants were collected and stored at -20'C
   until cytokine quantification. MCP-1, IL-6, TNF-a, and IP-10 concentrations were
15 determined by sandwich ELISA (human MCP-1, IL-6, TNF-a, IP-10 ELISA kits (R&D
   Systems). The experiments with human whole blood were repeated three to four times.
   Figure 3 is based on one experiment only, but considered representative.
   Results
20 The effect on AON activity (i.e. inducing exon skipping efficiency) of substituting all
   cytosines with 5-methylcytosines (m5C) was tested in cultured, differentiated, healthy muscle
   cells in vitro. In figure la and lb two examples are shown. When comparing PS229L and
   PS524 (=PS229L-m5C) (i.e. non-modified sequence SEQ ID NO: 91 compared with the
   modified sequence SEQ ID NO: 92 wherein all cytosines have been modified) in a dose
25 response transfection experiment using 0-100-200-400 nM, PS524 was clearly more efficient
   than PS229L at 200 and 400 nM (1.9-fold higher exon 53 skipping levels) (Figure la).
   Similarly, when comparing PS220 and PS399 (=PS220-m5C) (i.e. non-modified sequence
   SEQ ID NO: 101 compared with the modified sequence SEQ ID NO: 200 wherein all
   cytosines have been modified) in a dose-response transfection experiment using 0-50- 100
30 200-400-800 nM, PS399 was clearly more efficient than PS220, especially at lower
   concentrations (up to 10-fold higher exon 45 skipping levels at 50 nM) (Figure 1b). These
   results demonstrate that the presence of 5-methylcytosines has a positive effect on the
   activity of the AONs. In PS524 (SEQ ID NO:92) all 6 cytosines are substituted with 5

    la). To test whether such positive effect may be correlated with the number or percentage of
   base modifications incorporated, PS1317, PS1318, and PS1319, with respectively 4, 2, and 3
 5 of the 6 cytosines substituted with 5-methylcytosines (m5C), were tested and directly
   compared to PS524 in cultured, differentiated, healthy muscle cells in vitro. PS1317, PS1318,
   and PS1319 were all effective in inducing exon 53 skipping (47%, 37%, and 45%
   respectively) (Figure 1c). When compared to the levels obtained with PS524 however (64%),
   these results indeed suggest that reducing the number of 5-methylcytosines (m5C), from 6 to
10 4, 3, or 2 5-methylcytosines, leads to a reduced positive effect on exon skipping activity of
   the AON.
   To investigate whether 5-methylcytosines        affect bio-stability,  -distribution, and/or
   availability, a pharamacokinetic study was performed both in wild type (control) and mdx
   mice. The mdx mouse model for DMD has a natural nonsense mutation in exon 23 and is
15 therefore dystrophin-deficient. The lack of dystrophin at the membranes increases the
   permeability of the muscle fibers for relatively small molecules as AONs, and has indeed
   been demonstrated to enhance 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA AON uptake by muscle
   up to 10-fold (Heemskerk et al., 2010). The mice were injected subcutaneously with 100
   mg/kg of either 5-methylcytosine-containing     AONs (PS524, PS652 corresponding to SEQ
20 ID NO: 92, 185) or their counterparts with unmodified cytosines (PS229L, PS531
   corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 91, 137 ), three times per week for two weeks. At different
   time-points (day 1, 7, 14) after the last injection, the mice were sacrificed and different
   muscle groups (heart, diaphragm, gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and triceps) and liver and
   kidney were isolated to determine AON concentrations therein (Figure 2A). As anticipated,
25 for all compounds the concentrations in mdx muscles (average of all samples) was higher
   than those in control mice. The ratio mdx to control AON levels appeared relatively higher
   for the AONs with 5-methylcytosines. More specifically, in the mdx mice, the levels of
   PS524 and PS652 were 2- to 3-fold higher than that of PS229L and PS531. (Figure 2A).
   When monitoring the levels of AON in kidney and liver (known toxicity organs), the ratios
30 between muscle tissue and toxicity tissues remained similar, or were even favorable for
   PS524. These results suggest that AONs with 5-methylcytosine are taken up better by or
   more stable in muscle than AONs with unmodified cytosines. Indeed the half life in muscle
   was longer for PS524 (>20 days) and PS652 (25 days) when compared to PS229L (7 days)
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                  135
   and PS531 (10 days). In plasma, the Cmax values of the AONs injected were similar, which
   confirms that the mice received equal doses (Figure 2B). Remarkably, the AUC values (as
   indicator for bioavailability) were 1.5 to 2.3-fold higher for the 5-methylcytosine containing
   AONs. This was associated with a lower clearance which supports their higher muscle tissue
 5 levels. The results from this pharmacokinetic study thus demonstrate that the presence of 5
   methylcytosines has a positive effect on the bio-stability, -distribution, and/or -availability of
   the AONs, while the muscle/toxicity organ ratios were similar to those with the AONs with
   unmodified cytosines.
10 The in vitro safety profile of AONs with 5-methylcytosines (PS648, PS653 corresponding to
   SEQ ID NO: 201, 192) was compared to that of AONs with unmodified cytosines (PS232,
   PS534, corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 119, 139). AONs may stimulate an innate immune
   response by activating the Toll-like receptors (including TLR7, TLR8, TLR9), which results
   in set of coordinated immune responses that include innate immunity. Several chemo- and
15 cytokines, such as IP-10, TNFc,     IL-6 and MCP-1 play a role in this process, and were
   therefore monitored in human whole blood incubated with 0 to 50 pg/ml of each AON (using
   commercially available ELISA kits). PS232 and PS534 both have unmodified cytosines and
   induced the release of TNF-a (Figure 3A, B), MCP-1 (Figure 3C, D), IP-10 (Figure 3E, F),
   and IL-6 (Figure 3G, H) at increasing doses. In contrast, both PS648 and PS653 (with 5
20 methylcytosines) did not have any effect on TNF-a, IP-10 and IL-6. PS653, not PS648,
   seemed to induce a minor release of MCP-1 only. In conclusion, the presence of 5
   methylcytosines improved the safety profile of these AONs in vitro.

20
   Transfection and RT-PCR analysis
   Differentiated human healthy control muscle cells (myotubes) were transfected in 6-wells
   plates with a fixed AON concentration of 200 nM, according to non-GLP standard operating
   procedures. For transfection polyethylenimine (ExGen500, Fermentas) was used (2 Pl per pg
25 AON, in 0.15M NaCl). Aforementioned transfection procedures were adapted from
   previously reported material and methods (Aartsma-Rus et al., 2003). At 24 hrs after
   transfection, RNA was isolated and analyzed by RT-PCR. Briefly, to generate dystrophin
   specific cDNA, a DMD gene specific reverse primer in exon 53 (PS43/ PS559/PS 1106, SEQ
   ID NO: 111, 202, 203), exon 46 (PS188/PS785/PS1107 SEQ ID NO: 95, 204, 205) or exon
30 54 (PS235/PS786, SEQ ID NO: 120, 172) was used in the reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction
   on 1000 ng input RNA. The PCR analysis was subsequently done on 3 Pl of dystrophin
   cDNA for each sample, and included a first and nested PCR using DMD gene specific
   primers in exons flanking exon 51 (PS43/ PS559/PS1106), exon 44 (PS188/PS785/PS1107)

   according to non-GLP standard operating procedures as described [Aartsma-Rus et al., Hum
   Mol Genet 2003;12(8):907-14]. RT-PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (2%
   agarose gels). The resulting RT-PCR fragments were quantified through DNA Lab-on-a-Chip
 5 analysis (Agilent). The data was processed by "Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer" software and
   Excel 2007. The ratio of the smaller transcript product (containing the exon 51 (PS43/
   PS559/PS1106), exon 44 (PS188/PS785/PS1107), or exon 52 skip (PS235/PS786) to the total
   amount of transcript products was assessed (representing the exon 51, 44, or 52 skipping
   efficiencies in percentages) and directly compared to that in non-transfected cells.
10
   In vivo administration and RT-PCR
   The experiments with the mdx mouse model (C57Bl/10ScSn-mdx/J; Charles River
   Laboratories) were approved by the local LUMC Animal Ethics Committee (DEC number
    11145). Two mdx mice per group were anaesthetized using isoflurane and then injected
15 intramuscularly in both gastrocnemius muscles, with 20 ug PS49 (SEQ ID NO: 216) or
   PS959 (SEQ ID NO:214), diluted in sterile saline to a total volume of 50 pl per injection, on
   two consecutive days. Animals were sacrificed 1 week after the last injection by cervical
   dislocation and muscles were isolated and snap frozen in magnalyzer greenbead tubes
   (Roche). Six-hundred pl Tripure (Roche) was added to the tubes and muscles were
20 homogenized using the bulletblender machine, 3 x 1 min speed 10. The lysate was transferred
   to a clean tube to which 120 pl of chloroform was added. Samples were vigorously shaken en
   incubated on ice for 5 minutes, then centrifuged for 15 minutes at maximum speed at 40 C.
   The supernatant was transferred to another tube and 1 volume of isopropanol was added.
   Samples were mixed and incubated at 4 degrees for at least 30 minutes. Then samples were
25 centrifuged for 15 minutes at maximum speed at 40 C, washed with 70% ethanol followed by
   a second centrifugation step of 10 minutes at maximum speed at 4 0 C. RNA pellets were
   airdried and solved in DEPC treated water. cDNA was generated using 400 ng total RNA
   with random hexamer primers using Transcriptor reverse transcriptase (RT) (Roche
   Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCRs were performed by 30
30 cycles of 94 degrees for 30 s, 60 degrees for 30 s and 72 degrees for 30 s in a 50 pl reaction
   using 1.5 pl cDNA as template using primers specific for mouse exon 22 and exon 24. PCR
   products were visualized on 2% agarose gels quantified the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
   (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

   Results
   The effect on AON activity (i.e. inducing exon skipping efficiency) of substituting all
   unmodified cytosines with 5-methylcytosines and substituting all unmodified uracils with 5
 5 methyluracils (as in PS 1106, PSI 107, SEQ ID NO: 203, 205), and of only substituting all
   unmodified uracils with 5-methyluracils (as in PS559, PS785, PS786, SEQ ID NO: 202, 204,
    172), was first tested at a fixed 200 nM AON concentration in cultured, differentiated,
   healthy muscle cells in vitro (Figure 4A). The AONs with 5-methyluracils (PS559, PS785,
   and PS786) increased the exon skipping efficiencies 1.3- to 3-fold when compared to their
10 counterparts with unmodified uracils. When also replacing the unmodified cytosines by 5
   methylcytosines, the skipping levels were further increased (PS 1106 versus PS559, SEQ ID
   NO: 203 versus 202) or similar (PS 1107 versus PS785, SEQ ID NO: 205 versus 204). The
   effect on AON activity (i.e. inducing exon skipping efficiency) of substituting all unmodified
   uracils (as in PS49; SEQ ID NO:216) with 5-methyluracils (as in PS959; SEQ ID NO:214)
15 was then also tested in muscle of the mdx mouse model. PS959 with all 5-methyluracils
   increased the exon 23 skipping efficiencies approximately 3-fold when compared to PS49
   with unmodified uracils (n=4 per AON) (Figure 4B). These results demonstrate that not only
   5-methylcytosines may have a positive effect on exon skipping activity (as also shown in
   Figure 1) but also, 5-methyluracils, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition the combined use of
20 these 5-methylpyrimidines may even further increase activity.

   Transfection and RT-PCR analysis
   Differentiated human healthy control muscle cells (myotubes) were transfected in 6-wells
20 plates with a fixed AON concentration of 200 nM, according to non-GLP standard operating
   procedures. For transfection polyethylenimine (ExGen500, Fermentas) was used (2 Pl per pg

   quantified through DNA Lab-on-a-Chip analysis (Agilent). The data was processed by
   "Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer" software and Excel 2007. The ratio of the smaller transcript

   (PS235/PS897) to the total amount of transcript products was assessed (representing the exon
 5 51, 44, or 52 skipping efficiencies in percentages) and directly compared to that in non
   transfected cells.
   Complement activation assay
   Antisense oligonucleotides may activate the alternative complement pathway, which contains
10 several split factors, such as C3a and factor Bb (the latter is unique to the alternative
   pathway). The ability of AONs to possibly activate the complement pathway was assessed in
   plasma from Cynomolgus monkeys (LiHe plasma, CIT, France). Increasing concentrations
   (from 0 to 300 pg/mL) of PS 188 (SEQ ID NO: 95) and PS733 (PS207), in a dilution of 1:10
   (v/v)), were added to the plasma and incubated at 37 'C for 30 min. The reaction was
15 terminated by transferring the samples to ice and making dilutions in ice-cold diluent. Bb and
   C3a concentrations were determined by ELISA (Quidel, San Diego, CA).
   Results
   The effect on AON activity (i.e. inducing exon skipping efficiency) of substituting all
20 unmodified adenines with 2,6-diaminopurines was tested at a fixed AON concentration (200
   nM) in cultured, differentiated, healthy muscle cells in vitro. In Figure 5A examples for three
   different AON sequences are shown. The AONs with 2,6-diaminopurines (PS403, PS897,
   and PS733, SEQ ID NO: 206, 207, 173) increased the exon skipping efficiencies 2- to 4-fold
   when compared to their counterparts with unmodified adenines (compared to SEQ ID NO:
25  111, 95, 120). There seemed to be a correlation with the number of 2,6-diaminopurines in
   each AON.
   The effect of substituting all unmodified adenines (as in PS 188; SEQ ID NO: 95) with 2,6
   diaminopurines (as in PS733; SEQ ID NO:207) on in vitro safety, i.e. possible activation of
30 the alternative complement pathway, was tested in monkey plasma. Whereas PS188 induced
   relatively high levels of both split factors Bb and C3a, the 2,6-diaminopurines in PS733
   completely abolished the effect on the alternative pathway, showing no increase in either Bb
   10326474_1 (GHMatters) P97657.AU.1

                                                 141
   or C3a levels (Figure 5B). Thus the presence of 2,6-diaminopurines seemed to improve the
   safety profile of PS 188 in vitro.
   These results demonstrate the positive effect of 2,6-diaminopurines on the exon skipping
 5 activity and safety of AONs.
