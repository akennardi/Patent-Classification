                                                 FIELD
   [0002]           The present invention relates to methods of preventing, inhibiting, delaying,
   and/or mitigating seizures by administration of a steroid, e.g., a neurosteroid, e.g.,
   allopregnanolone.
10                                         BACKGROUND
   [0003]           Steroids, including neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone) are highly
   insoluble in aqueous solution. Various approaches are used to enhance aqueous dissolution,
   including the use of cyclodextrin solutions. However, even with cyclodextrin as a solvation
   aid, solubility is not sufficient to permit systemic delivery for the treatment of medical
15 conditions.
                                              SUMMARY
   [0004]           In one aspect, methods of preventing, treating, reducing, and/or mitigating
   one or more symptoms associated with and/or caused by traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's
   disease, epilepsy, anxiety, fragile X syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, lysosomal
20 storage disorders (Niemann-Pick type C disease), depression (including post-partum
   depression), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, alcohol craving, and smoking cessation in a
   subject in need thereof are provided. In some embodiments, the methods comprise
   administering to the subject a steroid.
   [00051           In another aspect, methods of preventing, treating, reducing, and/or
25 mitigating symptoms associated with and/or caused by epilepsy, in a subject in need thereof
   are provided. In some embodiments, the methods comprise administering to the subject a
   steroid.
   [0006]           In a further aspect, methods of accelerating the termination or abortion of an

    [00071         With respect to embodiments of the methods, in some embodiments, the
   steroid is a neurosteroid. In some embodiments, the neurosteroid is selected from the group
   consisting of allopregnanolone, allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, ganaxolone,
   alphaxolone, alphadolone, hydroxydione, minaxolone, and Althesin. In some embodiments,
 5 the neurosteroid is allopregnanolone. In some embodiments, the steroid is formulated in a
   cyclodextrin. In various embodiments, the steroid is formulated in hydroxypropyl-beta
   cyclodextrin or sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin sodium salt. In some embodiments, the
   subject is experiencing aura. In some embodiments, the subject has been warned of an
   impending seizure. In some embodiments, the subject is experiencing a seizure. In some
10 embodiments, the subject has status epilepticus. In some embodiments, the subject has
   myoclonic epilepsy. In some embodiments, the subject suffers from seizure clusters. In
   some embodiments, the seizure is a tonic seizure. In some embodiments, the seizure is a
   clonic seizure. In some embodiments, the subject is a human. In some embodiments, the
   steroid is administered intramuscularly, intravenously or subcutaneously. In some
15 embodiments, the methods entail treating, reducing, and/or mitigating symptoms associated
   with and/or caused by epilepsy by intramuscularly (i.m.), subcutaneously (s.c.) or
   intravenously (i.v.) administering allopregnanolone formulated in a sulfobutylether-beta
   cyclodextrin sodium salt. In some embodiments, the epilepsy is status epilepticus. In some
   embodiments, the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) is administered at a dose
20 in the range of about 0.25 mg/kg to about 15 mg/kg, e.g., about 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
   8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 mg/kg. In some embodiments, the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g.,
   allopregnanolone) is self-administered by the subject. In some embodiments, the steroid or
   neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) is administered by a caregiver who is not the subject.
    [0008]         In a further aspect, compositions comprising or consisting essentially of a
25 steroid and a cyclodextrin are provided. In some embodiments, the steroid is a neurosteroid.
   In some embodiments, the neurosteroid is selected from the group consisting of
   allopregnanolone, allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, ganaxolone, alphaxolone,
   alphadolone, hydroxydione, minaxolone, and Althesin. In some embodiments, the steroid is
   allopregnanolone. In some embodiments, the cyclodextrin is hydroxypropyl-beta
30 cyclodextrin, sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin sodium salt, or mixture thereof. In some
   embodiments, the composition comprises allopregnanolone and sulfobutylether-beta
   cyclodextrin sodium salt.

    [0009]          In some embodiments, the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) is
   administered or formulated for administration via an inhaler. In some embodiments, the
   steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) is nebulized or aerosolized. In some
   embodiments, the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) is nebulized or
 5 aerosolized without heating. In some embodiments, the nebulized or aerosolized steroid or
   neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) particles have a mass median aerodynamic diameter
   ("MMAD") of about 5 pm or smaller. In some embodiments, the nebulized or aerosolized
   steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) particles have a mass median aerodynamic
   diameter ("MMAD") of about 2-3 gm. In some embodiments, the steroid or neurosteroid
10 (e.g., allopregnanolone) is delivered to the distal alveoli.
   DEFINITIONS
    [0010]         As used herein, "administering" refers to local and systemic administration,
   e.g., including enteral, parenteral, pulmonary, and topical/transdermal administration.
   Routes of administration for steroid or neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone) that find use in
15 the methods described herein include, e.g., oral (per os (P.O.)) administration, nasal,
   inhalation or intrapulmonary administration, administration as a suppository, topical
   contact, transdermal delivery (e.g., via a transdermal patch), intrathecal (IT) administration,
   intravenous ("iv") administration, intraperitoneal ("ip") administration, intramuscular
   ("im") administration, or subcutaneous ("sc") administration, or the implantation of a slow
20 release device e.g., a mini-osmotic pump, a depot formulation, etc., to a subject.
   Administration can be by any route including parenteral and transmucosal (e.g., oral, nasal,
   vaginal, rectal, or transdermal). Parenteral administration includes, e.g., intravenous,
   intramuscular, intra-arterial, intradermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intraventricular,
   ionophoretic and intracranial. Other modes of delivery include, but are not limited to, the
25 use of liposomal formulations, intravenous infusion, transdermal patches, etc.
    [0011]          The terms "systemic administration" and "systemically administered" refer
   to a method of administering a compound or composition to a mammal so that the
   compound or composition is delivered to sites in the body, including the targeted site of
   pharmaceutical action, via the circulatory system. Systemic administration includes, but is
30 not limited to, oral, intranasal, rectal and parenteral (e.g., other than through the alimentary
   tract, such as intramuscular, intravenous, intra-arterial, transdermal and subcutaneous)
   administration.

   WO 2014/085668                                                            PCT/US2013/072351
    [00121          The term "co-administration" refers to the presence of both active agents in
   the blood at the same time. Active agents that are co-administered can be delivered
   concurrently (i.e., at the same time) or sequentially.
    [00131          The phrase "cause to be administered" refers to the actions taken by a
 5 medical professional (e.g., a physician), or a person controlling medical care of a subject,
   that control and/or permit the administration of the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g.,
   allopregnanolone) to the subject. Causing to be administered can involve diagnosis and/or
   determination of an appropriate therapeutic or prophylactic regimen, and/or prescribing
   particular steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) for a subject. Such prescribing
10 can include, for example, drafting a prescription form, annotating a medical record, and the
   like.
    [0014]          The term "effective amount" or "pharmaceutically effective amount" refer to
   the amount and/or dosage, and/or dosage regime of one or more steroid or neurosteroid
   (e.g., allopregnanolone) necessary to bring about the desired result e.g., an amount
15 sufficient prevent, abort or terminate a seizure.
    [00151         As used herein, the terms "treating" and "treatment" refer to delaying the
   onset of, retarding or reversing the progress of, reducing the severity of, or alleviating or
   preventing either the disease or condition to which the term applies, or one or more
   symptoms of such disease or condition.
20  [0016]          The terms "reduce," "inhibit," "relieve," "alleviate" refer to the detectable
   decrease in the frequency, severity and/or duration of seizures. A reduction in the
   frequency, severity and/or duration of seizures can be measured by self-assessment (e.g., by
   reporting of the patient) or by a trained clinical observer. Determination of a reduction of
   the frequency, severity and/or duration of seizures can be made by comparing patient status
25 before and after treatment.
    [00171          The term "mitigating" refers to reduction or elimination of one or more
   symptoms of that pathology or disease, and/or a reduction in the rate or delay of onset or
   severity of one or more symptoms of that pathology or disease (e.g., seizures), and/or the
   prevention of that pathology or disease.
30  [0018]         As used herein, the phrase "consisting essentially of' refers to the genera or
   species of active pharmaceutical agents (e.g., neurosteroid, e.g., allopregnanolone) and
   excipient (e.g., hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin or Captisol (sulfobutylether-beta

   cyclodextrin sodium salt)) included in a method or composition. In various embodiments,
   other unmentioned or unrecited active ingredients and inactive are expressly excluded. In
   various embodiments, additives (e.g., surfactants, acids (organic or fatty), alcohols, esters,
   co-solvents, solubilizers, lipids, polymers, glycols) are expressly excluded.
 5  [00191         The terms "subject," "individual," and "patient" interchangeably refer to a
   mammal, preferably a human or a non-human primate, but also domesticated mammals
   (e.g., canine or feline), laboratory mammals (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, hamster, guinea pig)
   and agricultural mammals (e.g., equine, bovine, porcine, ovine). In various embodiments,
   the subject can be a human (e.g., adult male, adult female, adolescent male, adolescent
10 female, male child, female child) under the care of a physician or other healthworker in a
   hospital, psychiatric care facility, as an outpatient, or other clinical context. In certain
   embodiments the subject may not be under the care or prescription of a physician or other
   healthworker.
    [0020]         The term "neuroactive steroid" or "neurosteroid" refers to steroid compounds
15 that rapidly alter neuronal excitability through interaction with neurotransmitter-gated ion
   channels. Neurosteroids act as allosteric modulators of neurotransmitter receptors, such as
   GABAA, NMDA, and sigma receptors. Neurosteroids find use as sedatives for the purpose
   of general anaesthesia for carrying out surgical procedures, and in the treatment of epilepsy
   and traumatic brain injury. Illustrative neurosteroids include, e.g., allopregnanolone,
20 Ganaxolone, alphaxolone, alphadolone, hydroxydione, minaxolone, and Althesin (a mixture
   of alphaxolone and alphadolone).

                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        1. Introduction
    [0031]         Treatment of status epilepicus requires rapid administration of anti-seizure
   agents, which are typically delivered either by the intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM)
15 routes. Allopregnanolone (3a-hydroxy-5a-pregnan-20-one; 5a,3a-P), an endogenous
   progesterone-derived steroid that is a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, is a
   powerful anti-seizure agent with potential in the treatment of status epilepticus. The present
   study determines and demonstrates the dosing of allopregnanolone to protect against
   seizures when delivered intravenously (i.v.), intramuscularly (i.m.), subcutaneously (s.c.) or
20 orally (p.o.).
    [0032]
        2. Subjects Who Can Benefit
    [0033]         In various embodiments, the subject has a condition that can be treated or
   mitigated by administration of a neurosteroid, e.g., allopregnanolone. Allopregnanolone has
25 many medical uses, including the treatment, reduction, and/or mitigation of symptoms
   associated with and/or caused by traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy,
   anxiety, fragile X syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, lysosomal storage disorders
   (Niemann-Pick type C disease), depression (including post-partum depression),
   premenstrual dysphoric disorder, alcohol craving, and smoking cessation. The subject may
30 or may not be exhibiting symptoms.

   [00341          Accordingly, the invention also contemplates methods of treating, reducing,
   and/or mitigating symptoms associated with and/or caused by traumatic brain injury,
   Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, anxiety, fragile X syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder,
   lysosomal storage disorders (Niemann-Pick type C disease), depression (including post
 5 partum depression), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, alcohol craving, and smoking
   cessation by administration of a steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) dissolved or
   suspended in a vehicle suitable for systemic administration (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous,
   subcutaneous), as described herein.
   [00351          In some embodiments, the subject has epilepsy, has a history of suffering
10 from epileptic seizures or is suffering from epileptic seizures. In various embodiments, the
   patient may be experiencing an electrographic or behavioral seizure or may be experiencing
   a seizure aura, which itself is a localized seizure that may spread and become a full blown
   behavioral seizure. For example, the subject may be experiencing aura that alerts of the
   impending onset of a seizure or seizure cluster.
15 [0036]          Alternatively, the subject may be using a seizure prediction device that alerts
   of the impending onset of a seizure or seizure cluster. Implantable seizure prediction
   devices are known in the art and described, e.g., in D'Alessandro, et al., IEEE
   TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 50, NO. 5, MAY 2003,
   and U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2010/0198098, 2010/0168603, 2009/0062682, and
20 2008/0243022.
   [00371          The subject may have a personal or familial history of any of the epileptic
   conditions described herein. The subject may have been diagnosed as having any of the
   epileptic conditions described herein. In some embodiments, the subject has or is at risk of
   suffering a myoclonic seizure or myoclonic epilepsy, e.g., juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. The
25 PTZ seizure model demonstrated herein is predictive of utility and/or activity in
   counteracting myoclonic seizures or myoclonic epilepsy in humans.
   [0038]          In various embodiments, the subject may be at risk of exposure to or may
   have been exposed to a nerve agent or a pesticide that can cause seizures. Illustrative nerve
   agents that can cause seizures include, e.g., organophosphorus nerve agents, e.g., tabun,
30 sarin, soman, GF, VR and/or VX. Illustrative pesticides that can cause seizures include,
   e.g., organophosphate pesticides (e.g., Acephate (Orthene), Azinphos-methyl (Gusathion,
   Guthion), Bensulide (Betasan, Lescosan), Bomyl (Swat), Bromophos (Nexion),
   Bromophos-ethyl (Nexagan), Cadusafos (Apache, Ebufos, Rugby), Carbophenothion

        3. Steroids
    [00391         The compositions generally comprise or consist essentially of a steroid, e.g.,
   a neurosteroid, suspended or dissolved in vehicle appropriate for systemic administration,

   WO 2014/085668                                                          PCT/US2013/072351
   e.g., a cyclodextin, e.g., hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin or sulfobutylether-beta
   cyclodextrin sodium salt, or mixtures thereof.
   [0040]          In various embodiments the neurosteroid is allopregnanolone (ALP).
   Allopregnanolone, also known as 3a-hydroxy-5a-pregnan-20-one or 3a,5a
 5 tetrahydroprogesterone, IUPAC name 1-(3-Hydroxy-10,13-dimethyl
   2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,14,15,16,17-tetradecahydro-1H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren-17
   yl)ethanone, and referenced as CAS number 516-54-1, is a prototypic neurosteroid present
   in the blood and also the brain. It is a metabolite of progesterone and modulator of GABAA
   receptors. While allopregnanolone, like other GABAA receptor active neurosteroids such as
10 allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (3a,21-dihydroxy-5a-pregnan-20-one; THDOC),
   positively modulates all GABAA receptor isoforms, those isoforms containing 6-subunits
   exhibit greater magnitude potentiation. Allopregnanolone has pharmacological properties
   similar to other positive modulators of GABAA receptors, including anxiolytic and
   anticonvulsant activity. Allopregnanolone is neuroprotective in many animal models of
15 neurodegenerative conditions, including, e.g., Alzheimer's disease (Wang et al., Proc Natl
   AcadSci USA. 2010 Apr 6;107(14):6498-503), cerebral edema (Limmroth et al., BrJ
   Pharmacol. 1996 Jan;1 17(1):99-104) and traumatic brain injury (He et al., Restor Neurol
   Neurosci. 2004;22(1):19-31;and He, et al., Exp Neurol. 2004 Oct;189(2):404-12), Mood
   disorders (Robichaud and Debonnel, Int JNeuropsychopharmacol.2006 Apr;9(2):191
20 200), Niemann-Pick type C disease (Griffin et al., Nat Med. 2004 Jul;10(7):704-11) and
   acts as an anticonvulsant against chemically induced seizures, including the
   pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) model (Kokate et al., JPharmacolExp Ther. 1994
   Sep;270(3):1223-9). The chemical structure of allopregnanolone is depicted below in
   Formula I:

    [0043]          In various embodiments, the steroid or neurosteroid is not a sex hormone. In
   various embodiments, the steroid or neurosteroid is not progesterone.
    [0044]          As appropriate, the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) may or
   may not be micronized. As appropriate, the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone)
10 may or may not be enclosed in microspheres in suspension in the oil.
        4. Formulation and Administration
    [00451          In varying embodiments, the steroid and/or an analog thereof can be
   administered systemically, e.g., intramuscularly (IM), or depo-IM, subcutaneously (SQ),
   and depo-SQ), as appropriate or desired. In varying embodiments, the dosage form is
15 selected to facilitate delivery to the brain (e.g., passage through the blood brain barrier). In
   this context it is noted that the steroids or neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone) described
   herein can be readily delivered to the brain. Dosage forms known to those of skill in the art
   are suitable for delivery of the steroid.
    [0046]          Compositions are provided that contain therapeutically effective amounts of
20 the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone). The steroids or neurosteroids (e.g.,
   allopregnanolone) are preferably formulated into suitable pharmaceutical preparations such
   as tablets, capsules, or elixirs for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions
   for parenteral administration. Typically the steroids or neurosteroids (e.g.,
   allopregnanolone) described above are formulated into pharmaceutical compositions using
25 techniques and procedures well known in the art.
    [00471          These steroids or neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone) or analogs thereof
   can be administered in the "native" form or, if desired, in the form of salts, esters, amides,
   prodrugs, derivatives, and the like, provided the salt, ester, amide, prodrug or derivative is
   suitable pharmacologically effective, e.g., effective in the present method(s). Salts, esters,
30 amides, prodrugs and other derivatives of the active agents can be prepared using standard
   procedures known to those skilled in the art of synthetic organic chemistry and described,

   Structure, 4th Ed. N.Y. Wiley-Interscience.
    [0048]          Methods of formulating such derivatives are known to those of skill in the
   art. For example, the disulfide salts of a number of delivery agents are described in PCT
 5 Publication WO 2000/059863 which is incorporated herein by reference. Similarly, acid
   salts of therapeutic peptides, peptoids, or other mimetics, and can be prepared from the free
   base using conventional methodology that typically involves reaction with a suitable acid.
   Generally, the base form of the drug is dissolved in a polar organic solvent such as methanol
   or ethanol and the acid is added thereto. The resulting salt either precipitates or can be
10 brought out of solution by addition of a less polar solvent. Suitable acids for preparing acid
   addition salts include, but are not limited to both organic acids, e.g., acetic acid, propionic
   acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic
   acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid,
   methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, orotic acid,
15 and the like, as well as inorganic acids, e.g., hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric
   acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. An acid addition salt can be reconverted to
   the free base by treatment with a suitable base. Certain particularly preferred acid addition
   salts of the active agents herein include halide salts, such as may be prepared using
   hydrochloric or hydrobromic acids. Conversely, preparation of basic salts of the active
20 agents of this invention are prepared in a similar manner using a pharmaceutically
   acceptable base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide,
   calcium hydroxide, trimethylamine, or the like. In certain embodiments basic salts include
   alkali metal salts, e.g., the sodium salt, and copper salts.
    [0049]          For the preparation of salt forms of basic drugs, the pKa of the counterion is
25 preferably at least about 2 pH lower than the pKa of the drug. Similarly, for the preparation
   of salt forms of acidic drugs, the pKa of the counterion is preferably at least about 2 pH
   higher than the pKa of the drug. This permits the counterion to bring the solution's pH to a
   level lower than the pHmax to reach the salt plateau, at which the solubility of salt prevails
   over the solubility of free acid or base. The generalized rule of difference in pKa units of
30 the ionizable group in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and in the acid or base is
   meant to make the proton transfer energetically favorable. When the pKa of the API and
   counterion are not significantly different, a solid complex may form but may rapidly

   disproportionate (e.g., break down into the individual entities of drug and counterion) in an
   aqueous environment.
    [00501         Preferably, the counterion is a pharmaceutically acceptable counterion.
   Suitable anionic salt forms include, but are not limited to acetate, benzoate, benzylate,
 5 bitartrate, bromide, carbonate, chloride, citrate, edetate, edisylate, estolate, fumarate,
   gluceptate, gluconate, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, iodide, lactate, lactobionate, malate,
   maleate, mandelate, mesylate, methyl bromide, methyl sulfate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate,
   pamoate (embonate), phosphate and diphosphate, salicylate and disalicylate, stearate,
   succinate, sulfate, tartrate, tosylate, triethiodide, valerate, and the like, while suitable
10 cationic salt forms include, but are not limited to aluminum, benzathine, calcium, ethylene
   diamine, lysine, magnesium, meglumine, potassium, procaine, sodium, tromethamine, zinc,
   and the like.
    [00511         In various embodiments preparation of esters typically involves
   functionalization of hydroxyl and/or carboxyl groups that are present within the molecular
15 structure of the active agent. In certain embodiments, the esters are typically acyl
   substituted derivatives of free alcohol groups, e.g., moieties that are derived from carboxylic
   acids of the formula RCOOH where R is alky, and preferably is lower alkyl. Esters can be
   reconverted to the free acids, if desired, by using conventional hydrogenolysis or hydrolysis
   procedures.
20  [0052]         Amides can also be prepared using techniques known to those skilled in the
   art or described in the pertinent literature. For example, amides may be prepared from
   esters, using suitable amine reactants, or they may be prepared from an anhydride or an acid
   chloride by reaction with ammonia or a lower alkyl amine.
    [0053]         Determination of an effective amount for administration in a single dosage is
25 well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed
   disclosure provided herein. Generally, an efficacious or effective amount of the steroid or
   neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) is determined by first administering a low dose or
   small amount of the agent and then incrementally increasing the administered dose or
   dosages, adding a second or third medication as needed, until a desired effect of is observed
30 in the treated subject with minimal or no toxic side effects. Applicable methods for
   determining an appropriate dose and dosing schedule for administration of a combination of
   the present invention are described, for example, in Brunton, et al., Goodman and Gilman's
   The PharmacologicalBasis of Therapeutics, 12th Edition, 2010, McGraw-Hill Professional;

10 range appropriate for intrapulmonary delivery, particularly delivery to the distal alveoli. In
   various embodiments, the aerosol particulates have a mass median aerodynamic diameter
   ("MMAD") of less than about 5 gm, 4 gm, 3 gm, for example, ranging from about 1 gm to
   about 3 gm, e.g., from about 2 gm to about 3 gm, e.g., ranging from about 0.01 gm to about
   0.10 gm. Aerosols characterized by a MMAD ranging from about 1 gm to about 3 gm can
15 deposit on alveoli walls through gravitational settling and can be absorbed into the systemic
   circulation, while aerosols characterized by a MMAD ranging from about 0.01 gm to 0.10
   gm can also be deposited on the alveoli walls through diffusion. Aerosols characterized by
   a MMAD ranging from about 0.15 pm to about 1 m are generally exhaled. Thus, in
   various embodiments, aerosol particulates can have a MMAD ranging from 0.01 gm to
20 about 5 gm, for example, ranging from about 0.05 gm to about 3 gm, for example, ranging
   from about 1 gm to about 3 gm, for example, ranging from about 0.01 gm to about 0.1 gm.
   The nebulized and/or aerosolized steroids or neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone) can be
   delivered to the distal alveoli, allowing for rapid absorption and efficacy.
    [00581          In various embodiments, the steroids or neurosteroids (e.g.,
25 allopregnanolone) is formulated in a solution comprising excipients suitable for aerosolized
   intrapulmonary delivery. The solution can comprise one or more pharmaceutically
   acceptable carriers and/or excipients. Pharmaceutically acceptable refers to approved or
   approvable by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S
   Pharmacopoeia or other generally recognized pharmacopoeia for use in animals, and more
30 particularly in humans. Preferably, the solution is buffered such that the solution is in a
   relatively neutral pH range, for example, a pH in the range of about 4 to 8, for example, a
   pH in the range of about 5-7. In some embodiments, the steroids or neurosteroids (e.g.,
                                                  -16-

   WO 2014/085668                                                             PCT/US2013/072351
   allopregnanolone) is formulated in a buffered solution, for example, phosphate-buffered
   saline.
   [00591            In various embodiments, the steroids or neurosteroids (e.g.,
   allopregnanolone) is prepared as a concentrated aqueous solution. Ordinary metered dose
 5 liquid inhalers have poor efficiency for the delivery to the deep lung because the particle
   size is not sufficiently small (Kim et al., 1985 Am Rev Resp Dis 132:137-142; and Farr et
   al., 1995 Thorax 50:639-644). These systems are therefore used mostly for local delivery of
   drugs to the pulmonary airways. In addition, metered doses inhalers may not be able to
   deliver sufficient volumes of even a concentrated steroids or neurosteroids (e.g.,
10 allopregnanolone) solution to produce the desired rapid antiseizure effect. Accordingly, in
   various embodiments, a metered doses inhaler is not used for delivery of the steroids or
   neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone). In one embodiment a nebulization system with the
   capability of delivering <5 gm particles (e.g., the PARI LC Star, which has a high
   efficiency, 78% respirable fraction 0.1-5 gm. see, e.g., pari.com) is used for intrapulmonary
15 administration. Electronic nebulizers which employ a vibrating mesh or aperture plate to
   generate an aerosol with the required particle size can deliver sufficient quantities rapidly
   and find use (See, e.g., Knoch and Keller, 2005 Expert Opin DrugDeliv 2: 377-390). Also,
   custom-designed hand-held, electronic nebulizers can be made and find use.
   [0060]            Aerosolized delivery of steroids or neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone)
20 allows for reduced dosing to achieve desired efficacy, e.g., in comparison to intravenous or
   intranasal delivery. Appropriate dosing will depend on the size and health of the patient and
   can be readily determined by a trained clinician. Initial doses are low and then can be
   incrementally increased until the desired therapeutic effect is achieved with little or no
   adverse side effects. In various embodiments, the steroids or neurosteroids (e.g.,
25 allopregnanolone) are administered via the intrapulmonary route at a dose that is about
   10%, 15%, 25%, 50% or 75% of established doses for their administration via other routes
   (e.g., via oral, intravenous or intranasal administration). In some embodiments, the steroids
   or neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone) are administered via the intrapulmonary route at a
   dose in the range of about 0.05 mg/kg to about 1.0 mg/kg, for example, about 0.2 mg/kg to
30 about 0.8 mg/kg, for example, about 0.05 mg/kg, 0.08 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, 0.3
   mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, 0.7 mg/kg, 0.8 mg/kg, 0.9 mg/kg, or 1.0 mg/kg.
   In some embodiments, the steroids or neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone) are
   administered via the intrapulmonary route at a dose in the range of about 10 gg/kg to about
                                                  -17-

   WO 2014/085668                                                            PCT/US2013/072351
   80 gg/kg, for example, about 20 gg/kg to about 60 gg/kg, for example, about 25 gg/kg to
   about 50 gg/kg, for example, about 10 gg/kg, 15 gg/kg, 20 gg/kg, 25 gg/kg, 30 gg/kg, 35
   gg/kg, 40 gg/kg, 45 gg/kg, 50 gg/kg, 60 gg/kg, 70 gg/kg, or 80 gg/kg. In some
   embodiments, the steroids or neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone) are administered via the
 5 intrapulmonary route at a dose in the range of about 0.3 gg/kg to about 3.0 gg/kg.
    [0061]         To prepare compositions, the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone)
   is mixed with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Upon mixing or addition of
   the compound(s), the resulting mixture may be a solution, suspension, emulsion, or the like.
   Liposomal suspensions may also be suitable as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These
10 may be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art. The form of the
   resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of
   administration and the solubility of the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) in
   the selected carrier or vehicle. The effective concentration is sufficient for lessening or
   ameliorating at least one symptom of the disease, disorder, or condition treated and may be
15 empirically determined.
    [0062]         Pharmaceutical carriers or vehicles suitable for administration of the steroids
   or neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone) provided herein include any such carriers known
   to those skilled in the art to be suitable for the particular mode of administration (e.g.,
   cyclodextrins). In addition, the active materials can also be mixed with other active
20 materials that do not impair the desired action, or with materials that supplement the desired
   action, or have another action. The steroids or neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone) may
   be formulated as the sole pharmaceutically active ingredient in the composition or may be
   combined with other active ingredients.
    [0063]         Where the steroids or neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone) exhibit
25 insufficient solubility, methods for solubilizing may be used. Such methods are known and
   include, but are not limited to, using cosolvents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), using
   surfactants such as TweenTM, and dissolution in aqueous sodium bicarbonate. Derivatives
   of the steroids or neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone), such as salts or prodrugs may also
   be used in formulating effective pharmaceutical compositions.
30  [0064]         The concentration of the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) is
   effective for delivery of an amount upon administration that lessens or ameliorates at least
   one symptom of the disorder for which the compound is administered and/or that is
                                                    -18-

   WO 2014/085668                                                           PCT/US2013/072351
   effective in a prophylactic context. Typically, the compositions are formulated for single
   dosage (e.g., daily) administration.
    [00651          The steroids or neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone) may be prepared with
   carriers that protect them against rapid elimination from the body, such as time-release
 5 formulations or coatings. Such carriers include controlled release formulations, such as, but
   not limited to, microencapsulated delivery systems. The active steroid or neurosteroid (e.g.,
   allopregnanolone) is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount
   sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of undesirable side effects
   on the patient treated. The therapeutically effective concentration may be determined
10 empirically by testing the steroids or neurosteroids (e.g., allopregnanolone) in known
   in vitro and in vivo model systems for the treated disorder. A therapeutically or
   prophylactically effective dose can be determined by first administering a low dose, and
   then incrementally increasing until a dose is reached that achieves the desired effect with
   minimal or no undesired side effects.
15  [0066]          In various embodiments, the steroids or neurosteroids (e.g.,
   allopregnanolone) and/or analogs thereof can be enclosed in multiple or single dose
   containers. The enclosed compounds and compositions can be provided in kits, for
   example, including component parts that can be assembled for use. For example, a
   compound inhibitor in lyophilized form and a suitable diluent may be provided as separated
20 components for combination prior to use. A kit may include a compound inhibitor and a
   second therapeutic agent for co-administration. The inhibitor and second therapeutic agent
   may be provided as separate component parts. A kit may include a plurality of containers,
   each container holding one or more unit dose of the compounds. The containers are
   preferably adapted for the desired mode of administration, including, but not limited to
25 depot products, pre-filled syringes, ampules, vials, and the like for parenteral administration
    [00671          The concentration and/or amount of steroid or neurosteroid (e.g.,
   allopregnanolone) in the drug composition will depend on absorption, inactivation, and
   excretion rates of the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone), the dosage schedule,
   and amount administered as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art.
30  [0068]          The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a
   number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that the
   precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the disease being treated and may
   be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or
                                                  -19-

   WO 2014/085668                                                            PCT/US2013/072351
   in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may also vary with
   the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any
   particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the
   individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising
 5 the administration of the compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are
   exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed
   compositions.
        5. Monitoring Efficacy
    [0069]          In various embodiments, administration of a steroid or neurosteroid (e.g.,
10 allopregnanolone) to a subject results in the prevention or mitigation of one or more
   symptoms of the disease condition being treated (e.g., traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's
   disease, epilepsy, anxiety, fragile X syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, lysosomal
   storage disorders (Niemann-Pick type C disease), depression (including post-partum
   depression), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, alcohol craving, and smoking cessation).
15 Symptoms of disease can be compared before and after administration of a steroid or
   neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) to the subject. Administration of the steroid or
   neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) to the subject is considered to be effective if the
   symptoms no longer occur after administration (e.g., seizures), or if the symptoms are
   reduced, alleviated and/or mitigated after administration.
20  [00701          In various embodiments, administration of a steroid or neurosteroid (e.g.,
   allopregnanolone) to a subject results in the prevention of the occurrence of an impending
   seizure and/or the termination or abortion of a seizure in progress.
    [00711          In various embodiments, efficacy can be monitored by the subject. For
   example, in a subject experiencing aura or receiving a warning from a seizure prediction
25 device, the subject can self-administer a dose of the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g.,
   allopregnanolone). If the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) is administered in
   an efficacious amount, the sensation of aura should subside and/or the seizure prediction
   device should no longer predict the imminent occurrence of an impending seizure. If the
   sensation of aura does not subside and/or the seizure prediction device continues to predict
30 an impending seizure, a second dose of steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) can
   be administered.

   WO 2014/085668                                                           PCT/US2013/072351
    [00721         In other embodiments, the efficacy is monitored by a caregiver. For
   example, in a subject experiencing the onset of a seizure or in situations where a seizure has
   commenced, the subject may require administration of the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g.,
   allopregnanolone) by a caregiver. If the steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) is
 5 administered in an efficacious amount, the seizure, along with the subject's symptoms of the
   seizure, should terminate or abort. If the seizure does not terminate, a second dose of the
   steroid or neurosteroid (e.g., allopregnanolone) can be administered.
                                            EXAMPLES
    [0073]         The following examples are offered to illustrate, but not to limit the claimed
10 invention.
                                             Example 1
         Anticonvulsant Activity of Intravenous and Intramuscular Allopregnanolone
   RATIONALE:
    [0074]         Treatment of status epilepicus requires rapid administration of antiseizure
15 agents, which are typically delivered either by the intravenous (i.v.) or intramuscular (i.m.)
   routes. Allopregnanolone (3a-hydroxy-5a-pregnan-20-one; 5a,3a-P), an endogenous
   progesterone-derived steroid that is a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, is a
   powerful antiseizure agent with potential in the treatment of status epilepticus. The
   objective of this study was to determine the dosing of allopregnanolone to protect against
20 seizures when delivered i.v. and i.m.
   METHODS:
    [00751         The mouse 6 Hz and pentylenetetrazol seizure models were used. Solutions
   of 5a,3a-P were made in 6% (0.5 and 1.5 mg/ml) sulfobutylether-3-cyclodextrin sodium
   salt (Captisol@) in 0.9% saline. The solutions were injected i.v. or i.m. (1, 2 and 30 min or
25 2 and 30 min, respectively) prior to administration of the 6 Hz electrical stimulus or PTZ
   (80 mg/kg, i.p.). In case of the PTZ model, animals were observed for 30 min and times to
   myoclonic jerks and clonic and tonic seizures were recorded. Anticonvulsant activity was
   assessed by the delay in onset of seizure signs. Allopregnanolone plasma levels in rats were
   determined by LC-MS.
30 RESULTS:
                                                 -21-

   WO 2014/085668                                                              PCT/US2013/072351
    [00761          5 a,3ca-P exhibited protective activity in the 6 Hz test 1-15 min after i.v.
   infusion (1.5 mg/kg) but was inactive at 30 min. In contrast, with i.m. administration
   (3 mg/kg) the onset of protective activity was slower (within 2 min) and lasted <2 h. At a
   dose of 0.1 mg/kg i.v. 5 a,3ca-P failed to significantly delay seizure onset in the PTZ model
 5 at all pretreatment times (1, 2 and 30 min) whereas a dose of 0.5 mg/kg administered 1 min
   before PTZ caused a marked delay for myoclonic jerks and clonic seizures and in 62.50%of
   animals prevented tonic seizures and mortality that invariably accompanies tonic seizures.
   When injected 2 min before PTZ 5a,3a-P (0.5 mg/kg) caused a similar increase in time to
   onset of seizures signs and prevented tonic seizures in 25% of animals.
10  [00771          5a,3a-P at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg completely prevented tonic seizures and
   mortality when injected i.v. 1 and 2 min before PTZ. When injected i.m. 2 min before PTZ,
   0.25, 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg 5a,3a-P protected 0%, 50% and 100%, respectively, of animals
   from tonic seizures. 5a,3a-P at the dose of 1.5 mg/kg i.m. provided significant protection
   against tonic seizures when injected 30 min before PTZ; the same dose injected i.v. 30 min
15 before PTZ was inactive. In rats, an i.v. bolus dose of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg 5a,3a-P caused
   mean peak plasma levels (2 min) of 337 and 746 ng/ml, respectively; for both doses, the
   pooled mean two component halftimes were 2 and 22 min.
   CONCLUSIONS:
    [00781          Our results demonstrate that i.v. 5a,3a-P provides very rapid but transitory
20 anticonvulsant activity. When injected i.m., 5a,3a-P acts comparably quickly and has a
   longer duration of action. Parenteral 5a,3a-P may be useful for the acute treatment of
   seizures.
   DETAILED METHODS
    [00791          Animals. Male NIH Swiss mice (22-30 g) served as subjects, and all
25 procedures used in these studies were conducted in accordance with the University of
   California, Davis, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee the Animal Care and Use
   policies in strict compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of
   the National Research Council (National Academy Press, Washington,DC; on the internet at
   nap.edu/readingroom/books/labrats/).
30  [0080]          Test substances and drug administration. Allopregnanolone (3a-hydroxy
   5a-pregnan-20-one; 5a,3a-P) was synthesized by a SAFC Pharma Inc, Madison, WI, USA
   and Captisol (sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin sodium salt) was provided by Ligand
                                                   -22-

    WO 2014/085668                                                           PCT/US2013/072351
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA. Solutions of 5a,3a-P were made in 6% (0.5 and
    1.5 mg/ml) or 24% (6 mg/kg) sulfobutylether-3-cyclodextrin sodium salt (Captisol@) in
    0.9% saline. The volumes used for all injections were 10 - 20 ml/kg of body weight. In
    order to establish time courses for protection by 5a,3a-P in the 6-Hz electrical-stimulation
 5  (32 mA, 3 s) model, 5a,3a-P (0.5 - 6 mg/kg) was administered intravenously (i.v.),
    intramuscularly (i.m.), subcutaneously (s.c.) or orally (p.o.) before electrical stimulation. In
   the PTZ seizure test, 5a,3a-P or vehicle were administered i.v. or i.m. 1, 2 or 30 min before
    PTZ.
    Seizures models
10  [0081]           6-Hz seizure test (Kaminski, et al., Epilepsia (2004) 45:1-4): 3-s corneal
    stimulation (200-pis duration, 32-mA monopolar rectangular pulses at 6 Hz) was delivered
   by a constant-current device (ECT Unit 5780; Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy). After the
    stimulation, the animals exhibited a "stunned" posture associated with rearing and
    automatic movements that lasted from 60 to 120 s in untreated animals. The experimental
15  end point was protection against the seizure: an animal was considered to be protected if it
   resumed its normal exploratory behavior within 10 s of stimulation.
    [0082]           Pentylenetetrazolseizure test (Kokate, et al., J PharmacolExp Ther (1994)
    270:1223-9): mice were injected intraperitoneally with PTZ (80 mg/kg) and were observed
    for a 30-min period. The time of onset of myoclonic jerks, clonus and tonic extension was
20 recorded.
    [0083]           Surgery and blood collection. Male rats were implanted with indwelling
   jugular catheters as described (Baumann, et al., JNeurosci. (1998) 18: 9069-77). Animals
   were allowed to recover for at least one week. Experiments were carried out while the
    animal resided in its home cage. Rats received i.v. injection of vehicle or 5a,3a-P and serial
25 blood samples were withdrawn into chilled tubes at 1, 2 , 10,15, 30, 60 and 120 min after
    i.v. injection. 5a,3a-P and D4- 5a,3a-P (internal standard) were extracted with SPE method
    from rat's plasma. The extracted 5a,3a-P and D4- 5a,3a-P were quantified with ultra
   performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)/Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization
    (APCI)/ tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).
30  [0084]           Data analysis. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E.M.; the significance of
   the difference in the responses of treatment groups with respect to control is based on one
   way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by specific post hoc comparisons using
                                                  -23-

   WO 2014/085668                                                          PCT/US2013/072351
   Dunnett's test. Differences were considered statistically significant when the probability of
   error was less than 0.05 (p < 0.05).
    [00851         Results are shown in Figures 1-10. Our results demonstrate that i.v. 5aU,3aU-P
   provides very rapid but transitory anticonvulsant activity. When injected i.m., 5a,3a-P acts
 5 comparably quickly and has a longer duration of action. Low bioavailability of 5a,3a-P
   after oral administration prolongs the time of the peak effect and duration of action.
   Parenteral 5a,3a-P is useful for the acute treatment of seizures.
