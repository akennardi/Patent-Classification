FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]       The present invention relates to a water filtration device and in particular to a
water filtration device that can provide filtered water for a whole house or commercial
establishment. It also enables for the filtration devices to be replaced or bypassed as may
be required.
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]       Water filtration devices are known and typically consist of a water filter cartridge
that is placed in line with a supply of water to further filtrate the water prior to use. Such
devices are well known where they are located usually inside a kitchen to provide for filtered
drinking water.
[0003]       However in some locations the water quality, whilst suitable for drinking, may
include minerals that unduly affect appliances such as washing machines and dishwashers.
This water is generally called hard water and typically contains minerals such as calcium and
magnesium leading to a shorter lifespan of appliances due to the build-up of mineral
deposits. By using filtered water not only is the lifespan of the appliances increased but
there is a reduction in the use of soap and washing detergent.
[0004]       Current water filtration devices are mainly used to filter drinking water and are
located at an outlet in the kitchen and consist of one or two filter cartridges that have to be
replaced after a certain time or after a volume of water has passed through them. When
they need replacing, the user simply stops using the filtered water and wait until the
cartridges have been replaced. At the same time, water is still used in the premises for other
activities such as washing or bathing.
[0005]       It is however preferred that all of the water that may be used in a house or
commercial premise be filtered and that furthermore the filtering system is not obtrusive.
[0006]        It is therefore an objective of this invention to provide a water filtration
assembly that alleviates the above problems, or at least provides the public with a useful
alternative.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0007]        In a first aspect the invention comprises a water filtration system including a
water inlet fluidly connected to a pipe between an inlet valve and an outlet valve, the pipe
fluidly connected to the inlet and outlet of a filter and having an water outlet located
between the outlet of the filter and the outlet valve wherein in use the inlet valve is open
and the outlet valve is closed causing water to flow from the water inlet, through the filter
and out through water outlet to an establishment;
wherein to bypass the filter the inlet valve is closed and the outlet valve is open.
[0008]        In preference there are multiple filters with each filter performing a specific
filtration including but not limited to particulates, chemicals and salts.
[0009]        In preference each filter includes a pressure measurement apparatus.
[0010]        In preference the water filtration device further includes a pressure reduction
valve located in the water inlet.
[0011]        In preference the water filtration device further includes a one-way valve in the
water outlet.
[0012]        It should be noted that any one of the aspects mentioned above may include any
of the features of any of the other aspects mentioned above and may include any of the
features of any of the embodiments described below as appropriate.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0021]        The following detailed description of the invention refers to the accompanying
drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the
drawings and the following description to refer to the same and like parts. Dimensions of
certain parts shown in the drawings may have been modified and/or exaggerated for the
purposes of clarity or illustration.
[0022]        Turning now to the drawings in details there is provided a water filter assembly
10. A water meter 12 is provided water through a mains inlet 24 and typically measures the
water used in an establishment before feeding it through an inlet pipe 14 to a water filter
arrangement 16 located in a pit 18 that is dug into the ground. The filtered water is then fed
to an establishment through outlet pipe 20. By being located in the ground, it provides for a
neat and unobtrusive construction as illustrated in Figure 3 where a lid 22 is supported by
ledge 26. The lid 22 includes apertures 28 that allow for its easy removal and for access to
the arrangement 16. In case there is ever a water leak then the supply of water to the water
filter arrangement can be turned off by use of tap 30.
[0023]         Referring in particular to Figures 4 to 7 the water supplied from meter 12
through inlet pipe 14 is fed through a T-piece 29 to pipe 31 that has a first valve 32 at one
end and a second valve 42 at the other end. In normal use, valve 32 is opened and valve 42
closed. Thus water flows through valve 32 into supply conduit 34 that feeds water into a
first filter cartridge 36. Typically the first cartridge is designed to filter out particulates of a
certain size down to 5 microns. Once the water flows through the first cartridge 36 it is fed
through into a second cartridge 38 that is designed to filter out chemical's using granulated
activated carbon. This water is fed into the establishment through outlet conduit 40.

[0024]        It is to be understood that the sequence of the filters/cartridges is not that
critical and also that in some instance there may be only one filter or indeed a plurality of
filters. For example a third filter may be employed to remove bacteria and/or salts just to
name a few uses. Yet a further filter may be employed that eliminates bacteria.
[0025]        In some cases the mains water pressure may be too high and a pressure
reduction valve 44 is located between inlet pipe 14 and pipe 31. The typical desired pressure
is some 5.8 bar.
[0026]        With the valve 32 opened and valve 42 closed water flows through inlet pipe 14,
through the filters and then out through outlet pipe 20 to the establishment such as a house.
 The filters are capable of filtering water on a volume basis and typically need replacing when
they become clogged. To assist in determining when the filters have to be replaced a first
pressure meter 44 measures the pressure through the first filter cartridge 36 and a second
pressure meter 48 measures the pressure through the second filter cartridge 38. When the
pressure(s) falls below an acceptable level the use knows it is time to change the filter
cartridges. To enable the cartridges to be replaced or indeed the filtering system to be
bypassed valve 32 is shut and valve 42 opened allowing water to flow directly from inlet pipe
14 to outlet pipe 20.
[0027]       To replace the cartridges obviously the pressure in them has to be reduced and
thus release valves 50a and 50b are located in communication with respective filter
cartridges. Once the cartridges are depressurised they can be replaced - typically the
cartridge housings 60 are screwed on to a lid 62.
[0028]       The cartridges are supported by plate 52 having a rear wall 54 having apertures
56. This enables the user to, instead of housing the filter system in the pit 18, hang it up on a
wall or the like using well known methods such as screws.
[0029]        Screws 58 are used to connect the filter cartridges to the plate 52. Of course
other fixing means may well be used and it is not the intention of the present application to
limit the way the system is put together.
[0030]        A one-way valve 64 located in the outlet conduit ensures that water does not
flow back into the system - that is to prevent back-flow.

[0031]      Typically a first filter is used to remove particulates down to a size of five microns
and a second filter may be used to remove chemicals being made up of granulated activated
carbon. Yet a third filter may be used to remove salts and so on.
[0032]       Whilst not illustrated the whole system may be able to be remote monitored. It
is well known in the art to provide digital reading of various feature of the present system,
such as the inlet flow rate, outlet flow rate, the pressure in each of the cartridges, the
temperature of the water, the total volume of water passing through the system, the pH,
conductivity and indeed any other parameter that may be deemed to be useful and provide
that information through a remote communication system to an application such as an app.
In some instances a warning signal may be sent to the user indicating if any parameter is
different to a desired threshold or range.
