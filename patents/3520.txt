             [0002]               Methods related generally to the removal of atmospheric pollutants from the
gas phase, are provided, as well as related apparatus, processes and uses thereof.
                                                       BACKGROUND
             [0003]               Atmospheric pollutants include those gases, particles, radicals and other
molecules that make their way into the atmosphere from other sources or form in the atmosphere
from the chemical reactions of other molecules and energy sources. In general, atmospheric
pollutants can damage the atmosphere by contributing to the "greenhouse effect", by breaking
down the ozone layer, or by contributing to incidents of asthma and breathing problems. These
pollutants are not merely confined to the outside, but can also be found in buildings. For
example, many buildings have loading docks near an air intake system. When a truck pulls up to
the loading dock, the truck exhaust can be pulled into the air intake system for a building and
pollute the indoor air. There are also sources of atmospheric pollutants that originate from
materials inside a building, such as carpet, paint, and commonly used chemicals.
             [0004]               Nitrogen oxides include a group of six compounds.       Two members of this
group, nitrogen oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (N02), often referred to as NOx, are reactive
species that are considered problematic atmospheric pollutants and that are subject to regulatory
9867201 1 (GHMattersi P97470.AU.1

control. The gases are regulated because of the large quantities produced through combustion
and other chemical reactions and because of their adverse effects in atmospheric chemistry. More
than 2 million tons of NOx were generated within the United States in 2011. Combustion
typically produces 95% NO and 5% N02. Nitric oxide, NO, is a significant reactive species in an
atmospheric system, along with being present in several types of waste gases.                            It is the key
component in the chain oxidation of organics, which is brought about initially by the radical
product of the reaction of hydroxyl radical with organic compounds then adding an ozone
molecule to the open radical site. NO scavenges an oxygen atom from the radical organic species
to form N02. In ambient air, there are other important mechanisms by which NO is quickly
converted to NO2, including the following (wherein R is an organic moiety):

             [0005]              A significant observation from the reactions above is that NO and ozone do
not reside in the same system in significant concentrations, since NO reacts with ozone quite
rapidly comparatively. NO can also react with RO and OH radicals, which have been called
"nighttime storage reactions" for NO. Those two reactions are effective until dawn, because
HONO and RONO will rapidly photolyze when the sun rises. Researchers have observed that
when benzene and NO are in the same system, there is a direct reaction between the two where a
series of nitrophenols are formed.
             [0006]              The product of most of the NO reactions, NO2, is also responsible for several
important reactions in the atmosphere. The first significant reactions for N02 are its reaction
with ozone to form nitrate radical and oxygen or nitric oxide and two molecules of oxygen in
reactions (14) and (15) below. This reaction is similar to the reaction of nitric oxide and ozone,
in that neither molecule can simultaneously reside in the atmosphere in large concentrations.
The nitrogen dioxide and ozone reaction has been attributed to the broad class of "nighttime
chemistry" that NOx is responsible for in the atmosphere. NOx chemistry is important because

many of its reactions do not require light, unlike several of the oxygen reactions. Ozone
concentration in the atmosphere is at its lowest at nighttime, and therefore, NOx species can
interact with other reactive species without automatically getting quenched by ozone.                        The
significant reactions of N02 in the atmosphere are as follows:

             [0007]              Reaction (13) is important environmentally because it is a source of nitric acid
in the troposphere. Nitric acid contributes significantly to acid rain and fogs during the daytime,
since most of the hydroxyl radical in the atmosphere is formed during daylight hours. Reactions
(14) and (19) are chemically important because the highly reactive nitrate radical is formed.
             [0008]              Nitrate radical has been shown by researchers to be highly reactive, especially
with organic compounds, such as simple alkenes and aldehydes.                             High nitrate radical
concentrations have been spectroscopically observed in polluted urban areas. The primary time
9867201 1 (GHMatters P97470.AU.1

of day that the nitrate radical is most reactive is at night. The reaction of nitrate radical with the
cresols and phenols is considered a significant sink for these organics at night. Nitric acid is
formed in this reaction scheme, which is an undesirable product in the atmosphere.
             [0009]               Research is currently being conducted to review NOx production in air
systems. One possibility for NOx compound formation is through the reaction of NNH and
oxygen atoms. This scheme is as follows:
             NNH <- N 2 + H                                                                      (24)

             NNH + O - N 2 + OH                                                                  (27)

             NNH + O - NH + NO                                                                   (29)
             [0010]               Reaction (24) shows the initial formation of NNH and is rapid on both sides of
the reaction leading to a quickly established equilibrium. Once NNH is formed in the system,
reactions (25)-(29) proceed at relatively high rates of reaction. Therefore, there are new
possibilities for gas-phase formation of NOx species in an air system.
             [0011]               Sulfur oxides (SOx) are compounds of sulfur and oxygen molecules. Sulfur
dioxide (SO 2) is the predominant form found in the lower atmosphere. It is a colorless gas that
can be detected by taste and smell in the range of 1,000 to 3,000 micrograms per cubic meter
(tg/m 3). At concentrations of 10,000 tg/m 3, it has a pungent, unpleasant odor. Sulfur dioxide
dissolves readily in water present in the atmosphere to form sulfurous acid (H2 SO 3). About 30%
of the sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is converted to sulfate aerosol (acid aerosol), which is
removed through wet or diy deposition processes. Sulfur trioxide (SO 3 ), another oxide of sulfur,
is either emitted directly into the atmosphere or produced from sulfur dioxide and is rapidly
converted to sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ).
             [0012]               Most sulfur dioxide is produced by burning fuels containing sulfur or by
roasting metal sulfide ores, although there are natural sources of sulfur dioxide (accounting for
35--65% of total sulfur dioxide emissions) such as volcanoes. Thermal power plants burning
high-sulfur coal or heating oil are generally the main sources of anthropogenic sulfur dioxide

emissions worldwide, followed by industrial boilers and nonferrous metal smelters. Emissions
from domestic coal burning and from vehicles can also contribute to high local ambient
concentrations of sulfur dioxide.
             [0013]               Sulfur dioxide is a major air pollutant and has significant impacts upon human
health. In addition the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere can influence the habitat
suitability for plant communities as well as animal life. Sulfur dioxide emissions are a precursor
to acid rain and atmospheric particulates. Due largely to the US EPA's Acid Rain Program, the
U.S. has witnessed a 33% decrease in emissions between 1983 and 2002. This improvement
resulted in part from flue-gas desulfurization, a technology that enables SO2 to be chemically
bound in power plants burning sulfur-containing coal or oil. In particular, calcium oxide (lime)
reacts with sulfur dioxide to form calcium sulfite. Aerobic oxidation of the CaSO 3 gives CaSO 4 ,
anhydrite. Most gypsum sold in Europe comes from flue-gas desulfurization. Sulfur can be
removed from coal during the burning process by using limestone as a bed material in Fluidized
bed combustion. Sulfur can also be removed from fuels prior to burning the fuel. This prevents
the formation of SO 2 because there is no sulfur in the fuel from which SO 2 can be formed. The
Claus process is used in refineries to produce sulfur as a byproduct. The Stretford process has
also been used to remove sulfur from fuel. Redox processes using iron oxides can also be used,
for example, Lo-Cat or Sulferox. Fuel additives, such as calcium additives and magnesium
oxide, are being used in gasoline and diesel engines in order to lower the emission of sulfur
dioxide gases into the atmosphere. As of 2006, China was the world's largest sulfur dioxide
polluter, with 2005 emissions estimated to be 25.49 million tons. This amount represents a 27%
increase since 2000, and is roughly comparable with U.S. emissions in 1980.
             [0014]               Sulfur dioxide is the product of the burning of sulfur or of burning materials
that contain sulfur:

Sulfur dioxide is also a by-product in the manufacture of calcium silicate cement: CaSO 4 is
heated with coke and sand in this process:

is oxidized by halogens to give the sulfuryl halides, such as sulfuryl chloride:

             [0022]               Sulfur dioxide is the oxidizing agent in the Claus process, which is conducted
on a large scale in oil refineries. Here sulfur dioxide is reduced by hydrogen sulfide to give
elemental sulfur:
             SO2+ 2H 2S -+ 3 S + 2 H 2 0
             [0023]               The sequential oxidation of sulfur dioxide followed by its hydration is used in
the production of sulfuric acid.

             [0024]              Carbon bed adsorption, or adsorption by another material, is a process that
does not convert the components of waste gases to other compounds as part of the process.
Adsorption is an effective way of reducing the concentration of components in a waste gas
stream at a low flow rate.
             [00251              The contaminated gas flows through the bed, where the components of the
waste gas can be adsorbed onto the bed material. There are, however, several problems with
carbon bed adsorption. First, the choice of the bed material is one of the critical factors in the
success of the component removal. Activated carbon, molecular sieves, activated alumina, and
activated silica are common bed materials, although activated carbon is commercially the
material of choice. The composition of the bed material influences which waste gas component
is adsorbed and which components pass through the system and into the outlet air stream.
Therefore, it is helpful if the operator knows the contaminants of the air sample that is being
cleaned.
             [0026]              Second, the adsorption technique does not break down the components of the
waste gas into smaller and/or other compounds; it only collects them on the bed material. Once
the bed becomes saturated, it is taken off line and cleaned. The cleaning process can involve
simply steam cleaning the bed, or regeneration, or can involve using a solvent combined with
steam cleaning to remove captured waste gas components. The waste products from this process
are then collected and disposed of by an environmentally safe procedure. The most common
procedure is to separate the waste gas components from the aqueous phase that was produced by
the steam cleaning process. This is time consuming, labor intensive and costly.
             [0027]              Another problem with the adsorption technique is that it requires more than
one bed in parallel and sometimes in series. The adsorption process requires beds in parallel so
that when one bed becomes saturated, it can be taken off line and the other bed put into
subsequent use.                  Sometimes, it becomes advantageous to put beds in series so that large
concentrations of waste gas components can be removed. The operator can also put beds made
of different material in series to target different combinations of waste gases. These adsorption
beds are quite bulky, since their average depth is one to three feet, therefore this process can be
undesirable if space is limited. The arrangement of beds in series and parallel add to the
consumption of time, labor and money in cooling and cleaning of the waste and the bed material.

             [0028]              Absorption is the process by which part of a gas mixture is transferred to a
liquid based on the preferential solubility of the gas in the liquid. This process is used most often
to remove acid stack gases, but it is a complex and costly method of control and removal of other
components of waste gases. The high cost of the process is based on the choice of the absorbent
and the choice of the stripping agent. Absorption is limited in its utility and not widely
implemented in small industrial settings.
             [0029]              Plasmas are electrical discharges that form between electrodes. There are five
general classes of nonequilibrium plasmas that can be used in some capacity for chemical
processing, including synthesis and decomposition: the glow discharge, the silent discharge, the
RF discharge, the microwave discharge, and the corona discharge. Each class is specific based
on the mechanism used for its generation, the range of pressure that is applicable during its use,
and the electrode geometry.
             [0030]              While electrical discharges are effective in breaking down components of
waste gases into other compounds and components, it is clear that in each of these discharge
arrangements, they require a power source (in some cases a significant one), may not be able to
handle industrial scale treatment without honeycombed and serial designs of the discharges, and
are generally designed to combat complicated waste gas streams that comprise various
components, including ozone, NOx and volatile organic compounds.
             [0031]              Wet scrubbing methods are conventionally         employed    for removal of
particulates, SOx and NOx from waste gas streams. For waste gas streams that contain a
significant amount of NOx, whether it was an original contaminant or the result of chemical
conversion of a volatile organic component, conventional technologies, such as those described
earlier, may not be able to efficiently handle the NOx load on an industrial scale. Conventional
technologies for industrial scale NOx treatment typically treat the NOx with two or three stage
wet scrubbing technologies. The most common currently used is a three stage process: Stage 1
converts NO into NO2. Stage 2 chemically transforms the NO 2 into other nitrogen containing
compounds. Stage 3 removes odors created in the second stage. Literature shows a number of
chemical reactants, some of which were outlined earlier, that are utilized in this and other multi
stage NOx treatment technologies. These include nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide, sodium
hydrosulfide and hydrogen peroxide, or ozone gas and sodium chlorite solution, ferric salt

solutions and others. All of these are relatively effective, but each has pronounced limitations in
operating costs, equipment costs or removal efficiency.
             [0032]              Conventional research has described chlorine dioxide's ability to convert NO
into NO 2, which has typically been described in literature as occurring in a wet scrubbing
apparatus according to equation 30 below. Researchers in this area also describe the use of
sodium chlorite in water solution within a packed bed or tray type scrubbing or other wet
scrubbing apparatus to convert NO 2 into nitric and hydrochloric acid as described in equation 31
below.

             [0033]              As shown in many of these conventional applications where waste gas
volumes are small, NOx and SOx can be adsorbed on carbon and other porous solid materials or
absorbed into liquids like sodium hydroxide and water. Although useful in small volume
applications, the technologies are not economically practical for industrial applications that
produce tens of thousands of cubic feet per minute of waste gas containing NOx and SOx.
Catalysts provide another technical option; they can reduce NOx into nitrogen compounds that
are not considered pollutants. Catalysts are effective on gas streams with small oxygen
concentrations. Unfortunately most industrially produced NOx waste gas streams also contain
high oxygen concentrations, so this technology is not applicable.
             [0034]              Methods known in the art for abating nitrogen oxides using, e.g., chlorine
dioxide, include those of U.S Pat. No. 4,119,702 to Azuhata et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,957,949 to
Senjo et al., and U.S Pat. No. 3,023,076 to Ernst Karwat.

             [0035]              Accordingly, it would be desirable to develop, produce and utilize an
apparatus and related process that converts NOx and/or SOx in a waste gas stream to other
compounds, molecules or atoms, wherein the apparatus and process achieves one or more of the
following goals: a) can operate on an industrial scale, b) does not require significant amounts of
energy from outside sources, c) can process waste gases in the gas phase with low, medium and
high amounts of humidity (including liquid and/or aqueous phase materials), d) can process
                                                            -9

waste gases in the liquid or aqueous phase, e) is cost efficient relative to the scale of the process,
f) is generally easy to install and operate, and g) can effectively operate as a single stage unit.
             [0036]               Current methods of cleaning air, such as catalytic oxidation, condensation,
absorption, and carbon bed adsorption, are in general bulky, expensive, and maintenance
intensive.            Therefore, a process that could minimize these problems found with the currently
used methods would be a beneficial next step in the development of better technology for air
quality control.                  An ideal process can control low concentrations NOx in air, as well as
successfully controlling larger concentrations of NOx that are present in the same air sample.

             [0082]               An apparatus and related processes have been developed that convert
atmospheric pollution compounds, including NOx and/or SOx, in a waste gas stream to other
compounds, molecules or atoms, wherein the apparatus and process may achieve one or more of
the following goals: a) operates on an industrial scale, b) does not require significant amounts of
energy from outside sources, c) processes waste gases in the gas phase with low, medium and
high amounts of humidity, d) processes waste gases in the liquid or aqueous phase, e) is cost
efficient relative to the scale of the process, f) is generally easy to install and operate, and g)
effectively operates as a single stage unit, regardless of how many reaction vessels are included.
             [0083]               Chlorine dioxide is a powerful oxidizing agent. Chlorine dioxide can react
with fluoride, fluoroamines, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, ammonia, phosphine, platinum,
phosphorus, potassium hydroxide, ethane, propane and methane. It reacts with steam or water to
produce hydrochloric acid. Chlorine dioxide can react with NOx and SOx, making it useful for
scrubbing waste gas containing these compounds. Contemplated embodiments include processes
and apparatus that remove NOx and SOx from industrial waste gas or other gas that contains
NOx (converts both NO and NO2 into mineral acids) and/or SOx. Contemplated processes
involve a chemical reaction between chlorine dioxide gas (C10 2) and the NOx in a single stage
air or mist type scrubbing apparatus. Contemplated processes utilize C10 2 to remove NOx from
industrial waste gas (or other gases containing NOx) in two ways: a) a reaction(s) between the
NOx in the waste gas and gaseous chlorine dioxide that is dissolved in a aqueous solution, which
may be at any suitable pH, including acidic, neutral or basic, and b) a reaction between CIO 2 gas
and NOx in a waste gas with high relative humidity. Both reaction types can proceed according
to the paths described in reaction (32) and (33) below, but contemplated embodiments are not
limited to any particular theory or presumed pathway. Both of these methods use a single stage
air or mist scrubbing apparatus that is a major departure from the multi-stage wet scrubbing
apparatus reported in prior art applications and utilized conventionally.
             [0084]               Contemplated apparatus and related processes convert NOx gases into other
nitrogen containing compounds that are not considered pollutants and/or convert SOx gases into
other sulfur containing compounds that are not considered pollutants. The technology of
contemplated processes treats NOx and/or SOx more efficiently and with lower initial equipment
and/or operating costs than the prior art processes described above. Although the present process
has broad technical application, it offers a profound and immediate improvement in the treatment
                                                           - 14
9867201 1 (GHMattersi P97470.AU.1

of industrially created NOx and/or SOx waste gas. The present process is applicable to industrial
applications like chemically dissolving and pickling metals, stationary source combustion
process flue gas, tail gas from nitric acid plants, shipboard combustion process flue gas and other
sources of waste gas containing nitrogen oxides. This process efficiently treats NOx and/or SOx
and is more cost effective to install and operate than currently available technologies for NOx
and/or SOx treatment described in other patents and literature.
             [0085]               Specifically, a single-stage air scrubbing apparatus is provided to address one
or more of the problems outlined earlier and includes: a reaction vessel having a first end, a
second end, an enclosure, comprising at least one wall, a volume within the enclosure, and a
residence time component, at least one introduction duct that is coupled to the reaction vessel,
and a turbulence component, wherein the residence time component is sufficient to allow the
conversion of at least one nitrogen oxide and/or sulfur oxide compound to at least one other
compound, molecule or atom. For mist-based C1O 2 processes, residence times of about 0.15
seconds to 15 seconds, are generally preferred, preferably 0.5 or 1 second to about 1.5, 2, 2.5, or
3 seconds, with approximately 1.5 seconds generally preferred. For gas-based CIO2 processes,
residence times of about 0.015 seconds to 1.5 seconds, are generally preferred, preferably 0.05 or
0.1 seconds to about 0.15, 0.2, or 0.3 seconds, with approximately 0.15 seconds generally
preferred.             However, in either mist or gas based processes, longer or shorter times can be
employed in certain embodiments. Various reactor configurations can be employed to obtain a
desired residence time in a particular apparatus footprint, depending upon construction and
spacing constraints.                 For example, the reactor can be positioned vertically, horizontally, or
positioned diagonally at any desired angle between 0 and 900. The velocity through which the
waste gas and chlorine dioxide passes through the reactor can be varied, with faster velocities in
longer reactors and slower velocities in shorter reactors.                    The reactor can be of any suitable
configuration, e.g., a straight tube, a helical coil, a tortuous path provided by a series of baffles in
a cylindrical tube, a tube including a series of switchbacks, multiple parallel tubes, or any other
suitable configuration.                 Pure waste gas can be added to the reactor along with the chlorine
dioxide, or the gases can be diluted, e.g., with ambient air, or with inert gases, treated gas
streams, or other gas streams including untreated gas streams. While it is generally preferred to
operate the reactor at ambient temperatures (temperatures typically experienced outdoors in the
various regions of the United States, e.g., -40'C or lower to 40'C or higher, typically 00 C to
                                                               - 15
9867201 1 (GHMattersi P97470.AU.1

about 25'C), heating or cooling jackets for the reactor can be employed, or other devices for
heating or cooling gases introduced into the reactor.
             [0086]               Good results derived from gas or mist phase scrubbing of NOx are discussed
herein. For example, greater than 99 percent of the NOx can be converted to nitric acid and
hydrochloric acid in approximately 1.5 seconds of residence time when mixed with gas phase
chlorine dioxide in very moist air, e.g. air at a relative humidity of approximately 100%, or
containing liquid water in aerosol form (e.g., a mist). It is typically desirable to operate the
reactor at ambient conditions of humidity. Such relative humidity levels can range from 2% or
below in extremely dry conditions to 100% relative humidity in coastal areas.                    More typical
relative humidities are as low as 10%, more typically 30-60% for desert areas of the
southwestern United States, to above 70% in non-desert areas. If higher moisture content is
desired, then water can be added in vapor or mist form. Additional research shows that mist and
dissolved C10              2  provide effective conversion of NOx in about 1.5 seconds, and gas phase ClO 2
provide effective conversion of NOx in about 0.15 seconds. Increasing humidity or moisture can
sometimes slow the reaction time. As noted above, conversion of greater than 99 percent of the
NOx can be achieved.                      Similar conversion levels may be obtained for SOx.          In other
embodiments, lower conversions of SOx and/or NOx may be acceptably obtained, e.g., 50% or
less up to 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, or 98 %, or up to 99% or more. In certain
embodiments, higher conversions may be obtained, e.g., 99.9%, or 99.99%, or 99.999% or more.
Although a single pass reactor is typically preferred, serial reactors can advantageously be
employed to provide higher conversion levels.
             [0087]               Good results are also seen when chlorine dioxide gas is dissolved in sodium
hydroxide solution or other basic solutions with pH above 9, and introduced into the reactor in
the form of a mist; however, with the appropriate chemistry considerations, a basic pH is not
necessary for effective conversions of atmospheric pollutants. It is instructive to note that the
solution pH is multifaceted issue. A high pH is not necessary for the some of the contemplated
chlorine dioxide reactions shown here. In fact, chlorine dioxide decomposes in high pH.
Therefore, it is important that the chlorine dioxide is exposed to high pH for only a limited
period of time. Fortunately, the chlorine dioxide decomposition rate is sufficiently slow that it
allows a high pH reaction environment for the second or two necessary to decompose the NOx.
A higher pH is introduced from OHf, for example, because this environment converts the NO 2
                                                             - 16

into innocuous compounds. Sodium hydroxide is considerably less expensive than chlorine
dioxide and its presence reduces the overall chemical cost in NOx destruction. There are several
contemplated methods of introducing a high pH into the process. One is to insure the high pH
liquid is introduced into the reaction chamber along with the chlorine dioxide gas. The second is
to mix it with the liquid-containing dissolved chlorine dioxide just prior to injection into the
reaction chamber. In a single mist scrubbing stage, NOx concentrations between 10 and 100 ppm
containing both NO and NO- were converted to the acids. An optional second stage mist or wet
scrubbing apparatus provides additional gas cleaning. This second stage can be designed to
capture excess chlorine dioxide and/or acid fumes. While concentrations of from 10 - 100 ppm
of NOx are desirably treated, in certain embodiments higher or lower concentrations may also be
treated, e.g., from 1 ppm or less to 1000 ppm or more.
             [00881               While single stage reactors are typically preferred, more than one reactor of
preferred embodiments in series can be employed to achieve higher conversion rates (e.g., 2, 3,
or more reactors in series).                   Multiple reactors of preferred embodiments in parallel can be
employed to provide compact conversion of higher volumes of waste gas. A single stage reactor
of a preferred embodiment can also be employed in connection with one or more other types of
conventional reactors as described above, either for first pass removal of NOx and/or SOx or as
an intermediate or final treatment step.
             [0089]               In another embodiment, at least one atmospheric pollutant can be effectively
converted by scrubbing with gas phase C1O 2 in waste gas with ambient humidity and ambient
temperatures as described elsewhere herein, and then direct the exit gas into a second stage
scrubber that recirculates NaOH (or another basic compound). This second stage treats any
remaining NO 2 and captures any extra C1O 2 . The captured C10                 2 is useful in the treatment of NOx
too. Furthermore, when the C10                  2 is generated using an electrochemical device, the effluent from
the cells can be utilized in the second scrubbing stage to minimize the addition of NaOH so as to
reduce operating costs.
             [0090]               Additionally, methods of removing atmospheric pollution compounds from a
waste gas stream are disclosed that include: providing a single-stage air scrubbing apparatus,
providing a waste gas stream having at least one atmospheric pollution compound, providing at
least one additional gas stream, mist stream, liquid stream or combination thereof, introducing
the waste gas stream and the at least one additional gas stream, mist stream, liquid stream or
                                                              - 17

combination thereof into the single-stage air scrubbing apparatus at a flow rate sufficient to allow
for conversion of the at least one atmospheric pollution compound to at least one other
compound, molecule or atom, and converting the at least one atmospheric pollution compound to
at least one other compound, molecule or atom.
             [0091]               In contemplated embodiments, NOx-containing gas and/or SOx-containing
gas (which are referred to herein as "waste gas" or "gas" or even at times "waste air") is
streamed through a vessel at a suitable gas velocity for conversion and scrubbing waste gas. In
some contemplated embodiments, a contemplated gas velocity is less than about 2500 feet per
minute. In other contemplated embodiments, a contemplated gas velocity is less than about 2000
feet per minute. In yet other contemplated embodiments, a contemplated gas velocity is less than
about 1500 feet per minute. In some contemplated embodiments, a contemplated gas velocity is
less than 1000 feet per minute. Gas velocities of from 100 feet per minute or less to 5000 feet per
minute or more can be employed. With these contemplated gas velocities, it is expected that a
contemplated residence time of gas in the vessel is typically about 0.1 seconds or more to about
 1.5 seconds or less, although in certain embodiments higher or lower residence times can be
employed.
             [0092]               Contemplated   reaction vessels are constructed of materials that  are
substantially impervious or resistant to reaction the waste gas and have a volume sufficient to
contain the waste gas stream for a period of not less than about 0.1 second, and in many
embodiments, not less than about 1.5 seconds. Suitable materials that can be employed for the
reactor include PVC, fiberglass, steel, ceramic, and various composite materials. Contemplated
reaction vessel designs may be any shape and comprise at least one wall. In some embodiments,
a contemplated reaction vessel is cylindrical (having a circular cross-section profile) because this
shape minimizes interference between the gas and the vessel walls. However, any reaction vessel
design that allows for the possibility of formation of very small liquid droplets and minimal
coalescing of moisture within the reaction chamber is contemplated, even if it is not cylindrical.
It is preferably understood that there are embodiments where liquid droplets and moisture do not
form, however, these components are preferably designed to withstand and address many
different types of waste gases, treatment conditions and resulting components. Therefore, if the
design considerations are reviewed to provide sufficient residence time, along with a lack of
                                                           - 18
9867201 1 (GHMattersi P97470.AU.1

moisture coalescence, then any design may be used, including rectangular, oval, triangular,
conical or a combination thereof.
             [0093]               As mentioned, contemplated apparatus comprise at least one introduction duct
that is coupled to the reaction vessel. A contemplated waste gas is supplied or provided to the
point of introduction to the reaction vessel through this at least one duct. The orientation of the
duct is can be adjusted as desired to improve performance. In certain embodiments, performance
can be enhanced by minimizing the interference between the gas and the vessel walls.
Contemplated orientations include: a) at the center of the end of a cylindrical vessel, or b) at the
side and tangentially aligned with circumference of a cylindrical vessel.
             [0094]               As previously     discussed, contemplated      embodiments    also comprise a
turbulence component. Contemplated turbulence components may comprise any single design or
combination of designs wherein the turbulence component functions to introduce gas mixing by
providing a swirl or turbulence to the waste gas or gas stream. In contemplated embodiments, the
turbulence component is located such that it can add turbulence or mixing to the waste gas or gas
stream before the gas comes into contact with the chlorine dioxide or when chlorine dioxide is
introduced into a mist or liquid. When C10                  2 is introduced as a gas the mixing can occur before,
during and/or after the C1O 2 is introduced, or before, during and/or after the ClO 2 is added to the
gas stream containing NOx and/or SOx. ClO2 can be added to the waste gas and/or the waste gas
can be added to ClO2 . Waste gases of different compositions can be combined in various
combinations with C10 2 in various sequences, as desired.
             [0095]               FIGS. 5-6 are directed to a circular device for introducing gas into the reactor.
The device includes a ring of PVC pipe with ends connected via a T-shaped connector. Gas is
introduced into the T-shaped connector and diffuses out through a plurality of holes in the walls
of the pipe (see detail in FIG. 6).
             [0096]               FIG. 7 is directed to a device for introducing turbulence into the reactor. The
device includes a bundle of short, small diameter PVC pipe lengths tilted at an angle to an axis of
a sheath fabricated from a large diameter PVC pipe. The short, small diameter PVC pipe lengths
are typically from about 2 inches in length or less to 12 inches in length or more, e.g., from 2, 3,
4, 5, or 6 to about 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 inches. Diameters are typically uniform, and from about
0.5 inches or less to about 2 inches or more, e.g., 0.5, 0.75, or 1 inch to about 1.25, 1.5, or 2
inches.         The pipes are typically tilted off of the axis from 5 or less to 85 or more degrees,
                                                               - 19
9867201 1 (GHMattersi P97470.AU.1

typically from about 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25 degrees to about 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75,
 80, or 85 degrees. The tilted pipes are preferably arranged in a spiral pattern so as to maximize
generated turbulence. The sheath typically has a diameter that facilitates placing the device in
the flow path of the reactor, e.g., as a pipe forming a portion of the length of a reactor, or as an
insert into the reactor having a diameter sufficiently small such that it can be inserted into the
larger diameter reactor, but sufficiently large so as to provide a snug fit to encourage passage of
 substantially all gas therethrough.               The device can be fabricated from any suitable material
capable of tolerating exposure to the waste gas and chlorine dioxide.
             [0097]              FIGS. 8-10 are directed to spinner spools for introducing turbulence into the
reactor. The blades of the spinner spool are tilted at an angle of 30 degrees; however, other
angles such as are described above with respect to FIGS. 6-7 can be employed. Any suitable
number of vanes can be employed, e.g., 2 to 30 or more, preferably, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,8, 9, or 10 to
about 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30.
             [0098]              While the configurations of FIGS. 6-10 are desirable for inducing turbulence
in many configurations, other configurations can also be employed, e.g., screw shaped blades,
baffles, plates with holes, etc. For energy conservation and robustness of equipment, stationary
devices for inducing turbulence are particularly desired; however, moving fans, blowers, mixers,
and the like may also be employed in certain embodiments.
             [0099]              In some embodiments, when the waste gas is introduced at the center of the
end of a cylindrical reaction vessel, a contemplated turbulence component is placed in the duct
just prior to the point where the gas enters the vessel, or it may be placed at the beginning of the
vessel just after the waste gas enters the vessel or the reaction can occur in the duct with no need
for a reaction vessel. Multiple turbulence components can be employed, spaced evenly or
irregularly along the reaction vessel, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or more.
The waste gas and/or the CIO2 can be introduced via one inlet, or a plurality of inlets, e.g., 5, 10,
20, 30, 40, 50, or 100 or more inlets, of various spacings and configurations.                 The waste gas
and/or ClO2 can be introduced in undiluted (or pure) form, or mixed with, e.g., air, inert gas (e.g.,
argon, nitrogen or CO 2 ), water, or the like, or with another reactive component.                        The
configuration of the vessel can be adjusted to account for the moisture associated with the ClO 2
when it is introduced into the reaction vessel. In other contemplated embodiments, when the
waste gas is introduced at the side and tangentially aligned with circumference of a cylindrical
                                                            - 20

reaction vessel, a contemplated turbulence component is located at a position to swirl or mix the
gas in the duct just prior to the point where the waste gas enters the vessel. In other contemplated
embodiments, if a rectangular or other reaction vessel configuration is used, then the turbulence
component preferably minimizes collision between the vessel walls and gas turbulence within
the reaction vessel when the C1O 2 is introduced in a mist or liquid phase.
             [01001               In embodiments where the chlorine dioxide is dissolved in a liquid, e.g.,
water, a chlorine dioxide fluid material or aqueous material is sprayed, released or propelled into
the waste gas stream. In contemplated embodiments, the chlorine dioxide fluid material is
sprayed, released or propelled a point just downstream of the point at which the gas is swirled by
the turbulence component, and in many embodiments, through a single nozzle. In some
contemplated embodiments, a reaction vessel comprises a single nozzle for this purpose that is
located just downstream of the point where the gas is swirled. However, in other embodiments,
such as where non-cylindrical reaction vessels are utilized, it may be desirable to utilize multiple
nozzles. In cases where multiple nozzles are used, it may also be beneficial for the gas coming
out of each nozzle to spin in opposite directions. In these cases, gas mixing is optimized and gas
turbulence is minimized.
             [0101]               In contemplated embodiments, the nozzle orientation is centered with the axis
of the gas flow and provides a full cone or other full surface pattern that evenly disperses the
material projected from the nozzle into the entire waste gas stream. In contemplated
embodiments, the rate of release from the nozzle may be calibrated so that it is at least twice the
velocity of the waste gas stream. When the nozzle is emitting a liquid it preferably produces
droplets of that liquid with a mean diameter of about 100 microns or less. In these instances, it is
important to remain below the dew point of the gas, and thereby prevent formation of liquid
droplets, especially those with a larger mean diameter.
             [01021               Contemplated liquids may be formed from a condensed spray, but may also be
formed from other methods and/or apparatus. Contemplated liquids could, and usually would,
contain high concentrations of HCl and HNO3 . Therefore, contemplated reaction vessels may
comprise a drain at a low point in the vessel to allow the removal of that liquid. In some
applications, depending upon other contaminants in the waste gas and the pH of the moisture
(fluid material) added to the waste gas, this condensate acid mix can be of commercial value.

             [0103]              When chlorine dioxide gas in introduced into a waste stream, it is preferably
introduced in stoichiometric excess for reaction with components to be reacted, e.g., SOx and
NOx. For example, the chlorine dioxide can be present in concentrations or amount or levels
greater than merely sufficient to react with the NOx as set forth in equations 32 & 33 below). It
is understood, however, that the chlorine dioxide in gaseous form is neutral, meaning that it is
not the ionic ClO2 that is formed when NaClO2 is dissolved in water. The ionic form is useful
for NO2 conversion into acids, but is not useful in the conversion of NO to NO 2 .
             [0104]              In some contemplated embodiments, the CIO2 gas is generated on site and
introduced (sprayed) into the waste gas through one or more nozzles described above, as either a
liquid or gas. Liquid has advantages and is used in some embodiments unless the NOx
concentration in the waste gas requires more ClO 2 than can be safely dissolved into an aqueous
solution. And the waste gas humidity is sufficiently low to allow the introduction of liquid
without exceeding 100% humidity. The dissolved C1O 2 gas concentration in aqueous solutions
typically should not exceed 3000 ppm for safety reasons, but systems may be designed such that
this concentration can be safely exceeded.
             [0105]              The   stability of chlorine    dioxide includes  three   primary    variables:
temperature, pressure and concentration. The parameters have been studied systematically by Ri
Ya Jin et al and Basic Chemical Inc., and others, which make the point that there are a number of
safe operating environments for chlorine dioxide. It is possible to safely utilize chlorine dioxide
in the NOx scrubbing technology disclosed herein for a variety of industrial and municipal waste
gas environments with significantly varied combinations of temperature and NOx concentration.
This does not mean that chlorine dioxide will not decompose to chlorine and oxygen below 9.5%
in air. But the induction time is in several minutes as FIG. 2 shows.
             [0106]              There are three operational environments to consider when evaluating the
safety and chemical availability of chlorine dioxide: gas storage, gas transport to reaction
chamber, and within the reaction chamber. Each of these can be different. For example, it is
only necessary to have the chlorine dioxide remain intact long enough within the reaction
chamber to complete the desired reaction.
             [01071              Several studies have been carried out to explore the conditions at which
chlorine dioxide is explosive. At ambient temperature, chlorine dioxide does not explode below
9.5 % in air by volume. Above this limit, spontaneous explosive decomposition is noticed with
                                                           - 22
9867201 1 (GHMatters P97470.AU.1

an induction time. Induction time decreases as the concentration of chlorine dioxide increases.
Based on these one can plot the tendency to decompose as a function of % chlorine dioxide in
air. (FIG. 1)
             [0108]              Regarding FIG. 2: a) the hashed area is a recommended environment for gas
storage - an environment with minimal decomposition, if it is necessary to store the gas (for short
or longer terms); b) the transport between chlorine dioxide generator and reaction vessel is
deliberately short and never obstructed, therefore requiring just seconds at most; c) as noted
above, the contemplated NOx reaction only requires 1.5 seconds so from an induction time
perspective the reaction chamber temperature could be elevated as long as the total partial
pressure remained low; and d) as a reference point a 10% chlorine dioxide concentration in gas
phase described in Figure 1 corresponds to a partial pressure of 76 mm of Hg in Figure 2 - a
value that is outside the safe working environment described in this chart. However, 5% chlorine
dioxide in gas phase described in FIG. 1 is well within the safe environment described on FIG. 2.
             [0109]              FIG. 3 shows that gas phase chlorine dioxide is theoretically safe at up to
9.5% (95,000 ppm(g)) when used in environments that effectively address all variables that
affect decomposition.                  The safe concentration for chlorine gas dissolved in water varies
dramatically with temperature. By way of examples, which are referenced by the arrows in the
above graph, some pulp and paper operations safely store thousands of gallons of chlorine
dioxide dissolved in water near 9000 ppm concentrations as long as it is maintained at near
freezing temperatures; chlorine dioxide is considered safe for transportation and general storage
at concentrations of 3000 ppm. This generalization is true as long as the liquid is stored at or
below 86'F; and at 104F chlorine dioxide in water is safe at concentrations near 2200 ppm. In
addition, there are other variables like sunlight and vibration that influence chlorine dioxide
decomposition which need to be considered in process design and chemical storage decisions.
             [0110]              As mentioned earlier, some embodiments allow for the ClO 2 gas to be
dissolved in an aqueous solution with pH above 9. In these embodiments, the basic solution
increases the scrubbing removal efficiency by providing enhanced solubility for NOx. The basic
solution, however, might be disadvantageous in embodiments where HCI and HNO 3 acids in the
condensate are being captured for commercial value.
             [0111]              In some embodiments, the rate of CIO2 addition is based on the concentration
of NOx in the waste gas. In applications where the NOx concentration is not consistent in the
                                                           - 23
9867201 1 (GHMatters P97470.AU.1

waste gas, then the addition of automated chemical feed controls may be utilized to optimize
both removal efficiency and scrubber operating costs. An example of contemplated automated
chemical feed controls is shown in Example 3. Contemplated automated feed controls are
designed to sense the NOx concentration in the treated waste gas and the liquid condensate pH
then adjust the amount of chlorine dioxide and basic liquid (if used) that are sprayed into the
waste gas.
             [0112]              A second mist or packed bed scrubbing stage is optional, and in some
embodiments, may improve the decontaminated gas quality while enhancing the capture of HCl
and HNO 3 . As mentioned earlier, the design of the reaction vessels is an important consideration
in order to avoid the formation of submicron HCl droplets.                    Mist eliminators can aid in the
removal of this condition if droplets are allowed to form.
             [01131              NOx-containing gas (waste gas, gas or waste air) may be streamed through the
reaction vessel using a blower to move the air through the vessel. This blower can be placed
before or after the vessel (upstream, midstream, or downstream of the vessel). In some
embodiments, the blower is placed downstream (after), because that placement keeps the ducting
and vessel at slightly negative pressure when compared to the atmosphere, thereby eliminating
the release of untreated air in the event of a leak. The downstream orientation can be
advantageous for another reason - it reduces the pressure in the reaction system slightly below
ambient. The lower working pressure enhances the safe working environment for CIO2 . A
variable frequency drive enhances operational flexibility by allowing the air flow to be reduced
during off hours while still maintaining a minimal number of air changes in the process areas that
create the waste gas.

EXAMPLES
EXAMPLE             1: EXEMPLARY PROCESS AND APPARATUS
             [0114]              A process for NOx scrubbing, as disclosed herein, is demonstrated in this
Example by using a single stage pilot scale mist scrubber. The pilot scrubber processed a slip
stream of waste gas at approximately 22'C from a chemical milling operation. The NOx
concentration in the waste gas stream varied between 10 and 100 ppm during the series of tests
completed to prove up this new process methodology; however, it are preferably understood that
significant concentrations of NOx can be treated in a waste gas stream, including concentrations
of about 20000 ppm or more. The NO/NO2 ratios in the NOx varied slightly however the NO
concentration was consistently above 90%.
             [0115]              FIG. 4 shows a section cut through a contemplated embodiment - the single
stage pilot scrubber - used in the performance testing. A scrubber vessel 10 is PVC pipe mounted
horizontally during testing. The vessel 10 in any other configuration and orientation that can
provide an enclosure for mist is applicable and included in this description. Waste gas enters the
vessel 10 through a PVC pipe 11. A PVC baffle plate 12 disturbs the gas flow linearity in the
vessel 10 prior to a gas swirling device 13. An air atomized nozzle (nozzle) 14 was used in tests
to introduce gas and/or liquid to the waste gas stream in the vessel 10. In some tests the nozzle
14 was used to introduce liquids through a tube 15 in other test only gas was introduced to the
nozzle through a tube 16. The pressure and flow rate of gas fed to the nozzle 14 were adjusted at
a regulator 17. A hole 20 was used to extract treated gas samples from the vessel 10. The hole
20 was repeated in the vessel 10 at intervals away from the nozzle 14 so that samples with
progressively longer residence time in the vessel 10 could be obtained and analyzed to determine
the rate of NOx destruction in the gas within the vessel 10. The rate of NOx destruction in the
vessel 10 was determined by comparing the treated gas samples from the various hole 20
locations against untreated waste gas samples takes at a hole 21. Gas was moved through the
vessel 10 by ducting 22 connected to the suction side of a variable flow rate blower.
             [0116]              Contemplated processes, as outlined earlier, utilize two methods in which
chlorine dioxide gas effectively converts gas containing both NO and NO2 into HCl and HNO 3 in
a single stage mist type gas scrubbing apparatus. The first method: reactions between gas
containing NOx and chlorine dioxide gas dissolved in a basic solution (preferably above pH 9).
The second method: reactions between waste gas with high relative humidity containing NOx
                                                          - 25

and chlorine dioxide gas. Both reactions could occur according to the paths described in equation
32 and 33 below. Both of these methods using single stage mist scrubbing apparatus are a major
departure from the multi-stage wet scrubbing apparatus reported in prior art.

             [0117]               The overall rate of reaction for both equations 32 and 33 with greater than 99
removal efficiency is less than 1.5 seconds of residence time when the humid gas containing
NOx and ClO 2 gas are well mixed.
             [0118]               An optional second stage mist or wet scrubbing apparatus can provide several
functions. First it can remove of excess chlorine dioxide in apparatus that does not include
automated controls to effectively regulate chlorine dioxide gas addition. Second, it can capture
HCl and HNO 3 acid fumes in apparatus that introduces C10                     2 as a gas that is not dissolved in a
basic solution.
             [0119]               The reactions described in equations 32 and 33 above occur more rapidly in
the mist and gas phase scrubbing technology than the wet scrubbing reactions described in
equations 30 and 31 in the background section. The increased speed of reaction reduces the
reaction vessel size required for conversion of NOx to acids. Furthermore, the air or mist
scrubbing methodology is less complicated and requires less maintenance than packed bed or
tray type wet scrubbers. As a result the air or mist technology equipment is less expensive to
purchase and operate.
             [01201               Gas analysis for NO and NOx was done during the pilot testing with
electrochemical sensors for NO and NOx. These sensors were evaluated for cross sensitivity by
other compounds known to be in the gas stream or suspected of being present in the gas stream
and also factory calibrated before and after testing. The electrochemical analysis was further
cross checked with EPA Method 07 for NOx.
EXAMPLE 2: FORM OF CHLORINE DIOXIDE GAS INTRODUCTION
             [0121]               Chlorine dioxide gas can be introduced to NOx and/or SOx in at least three
ways: as a gas, as a mist and as a liquid. These three methods use the same stoichiometry,
because it is the CO                2 gas that is reacting with the NOx as opposed to an ionic form of chlorine
                                                              - 26

dioxide in all three reactive environments, which is a major distinction between this process and
others that have utilized the ionic variation of this molecule for wet scrubbing in the past.
             [0122]               The gas and mist phase systems have different mechanical configurations. In
addition to different nozzle types, which is described in each section below, the sequence of
mixing, along with C1O 2 addition, may be different. Research has shown that mixing after gas
injection works better than the opposite in some embodiments, so in the gas phase this is the
sequence used, however, in other embodiments other configurations can be employed. The issue
of droplet aggregation may supersede this advantage in the mist systems. The mixing tends to
cause agglomeration. Therefore where mist is used the mixing is usually introduced prior to CO                   2
addition.
             [0123]               This contemplated application is ideal for operations with modest waste gas
flow rates and modest NOx and/or SOx concentrations. The boundaries are flexible, but can be
cost effective for waste gas flow rates of about 10,000 CFM or less and NOx concentrations of
about 1000 or less. Higher concentrations of NOx and/or SOx can be treated, e.g., by increasing
the concentration of CIO2 , or by diluting the concentration of NOx and/or SOx.
             [0124]               This process can be cost effective for smaller applications, because there is no
need for the cost of onsite C1O 2 generation. ClO 2 gas can be supplied that has been suspended in
water that is buffered to minimize off-gassing.
             [0125]               The CO   2 can be introduced before, during and/or after the waste gas is
swirled. Research has shown that air atomized nozzles are particularly well-suited for this
application. These produce fine mist droplets out of CO                   2 gas suspended in an aqueous phase.
The goal is to maximize the ratio of droplet surface area to liquid volume, which is achieved
when the droplets are in the micron or sub-micron range. Although smaller is typically better, a
desirable balance between performance and cost can be found when the mean diameter is about
 100 microns.
             [0126]               This is generally commercially available up to about 3,000 ppm C10 2 . Higher
concentrations are possible at lower temperatures, but the need for refrigeration introduces a
safety concern in the event the refrigeration system fails. If appropriate systems are developed to
address these safety concerns, then concentrations can be increased accordingly. This process
generally requires about 1.5 seconds of residence time for 99% removal. Higher removal
efficiency is possible with longer residence time.
                                                              - 27

             [0127]               Chlorine dioxide, in the gas phase, is introduced into the waste gas before it is
mixed. This application works for various sizes of NOx and/or SOx loading situations, but good
cost effectiveness in applications where the waste gas stream is in excess of about 10,000 CFM
with NOx loading of about 50 ppm or more. If cost concerns are alleviated, NOx loading can be
effectively increased. Contemplated processes can be applicable to NOx (and/or SOx) loading as
high as 50,000 ppm or more.
             [0128]               An amount of chlorine dioxide for reaction with SOx is similar to an amount
required to react with an equivalent amount of NOx (on a molar basis). In other words, the same
amount of C10                2  may be suitable to treat 2 equivalents of NOx or I equivalent of NOx and I
equivalent of SOx. The amount of chlorine dioxide added to the waste gas can be adjusted
depending upon the composition of the waste gas.                        Sensors can be provided that detect the
amount of SOx and/or NOx in the untreated waste gas and this information employed to
determine an amount of chlorine dioxide to be added to the untreated waste gas. However, it
may be advantageous to measure SOx and/or NOx in the treated waste gas. This information can
then be used to adjust, e.g., continuously or intermittently, the amount of chlorine dioxide
introduced into the untreated waste gas so as to achieve a target SOx and/or NOx concentration
in the treated waste gas. This latter configuration can offer advantages in that high SOx and/or
NOx concentrations as in untreated waste gas can cause premature sensor failure.                       The lower
SOx and/or NOx concentrations in the treated waste gas can substantially increase sensor life,
permitting longer uninterrupted operation of the reactor.
             [0129]               Contemplated processes using the gas phase can employ the generation of gas
phase C10          2   on site, which is preferably done using electrochemical methodology. Contemplated
chemical methods of generating CIO2 produce C10                    2 suspended in a liquid that has high pH and
impurities. These chemical processes also generate waste acid that can be treated. The high pH
(NaOH) and other waste products from electrochemical processes can be used in a second stage
acid fume scrubber so there is no waste to treat or to dispose, thereby offering a significant
environmental advantage.
             [0130]               This gas phase process is typically at least 10 times faster than the mist
process, as described above, such that shorter residence times can be employed.                           Current
research includes treating NOx in waste gas streams moving at 2500 feet per minute with 99%
removal efficiency in less than about 5 feet of duct length (after the mixing section). This
                                                              - 28

considerably fast gas phase reaction dramatically reduces the size of the reaction vessel or
eliminates it completely.
EXAMPLE 3: CONTEMPLATED AUTOMATED CHEMICAL FEED CONTROLS
             [0131]              Contemplated controllers are designed to handle the entire air scrubbing
process for a 32,000 CFM NOx scrubber system and similar systems. Contemplated devices
monitor and regulate the following components: First Stage NOx scrubber (using C10 2 ); Second
stage acid scrubber (using NaOH and other effluent from the ClO 2 generator; Manage a C1O 2
generator; Fans; Storage and packaging system for ClO2 gas suspended in water (hereinafter
identified as liquid C10 2 .); Communication both local and remote.
             [0132]              Contemplated control systems also manage the attached equipment in two
modes of operation:                  designed to insure the attached equipment can reliably and effectively
remove NOx from a waste gas stream in a way that safely optimizes the efficiency of the
reaction between NaClO 2 and electricity to form C10                 2 and optimizes the reaction between ClO 2
and NOx in the first scrubbing stage. Furthermore this system can insure gas leaving the second
scrubbing stage is free of excess C10                 2 and mineral acid fumes; and at times when there is no
need for gas phase C1O 2, then the ClO 2 generator has the ability to produce liquid CIO 2 in a safe
and reliable way.
             [0133]              This system is an integral part of maintain an effective system. If this air
treatment system is down, production stops because without it, the system is out of compliance
with regulatory constraints. Because this system is critical to production, the control system
includes sensors and control logic that allows evaluation of the equipment and reporting of
conditions that can lead to shutdowns before they occur. This allows the operators to take action
and avoid a shutdown in most if not all situations.
             [0134]              Therefore, this system design includes a detailed evaluation of the PLC logic
for a ClO 2 generator to insure this device can reliably and safely deliver CIO2 in the two
previously mentioned phases.

       1. There can be password control on the program. This applies both to access at the HMI
             and remote access.

                    a. Operator Level can have the ability to change process set-points pertaining to
                            NOx removal efficiency from the first stage and second stage. The minimum and
                            maximum pH settings for the second stage.
                    b. Technician Level can have the ability to change PID loop tuning variables,
                            intervals for data averaging and other similar variables plus those variables
                            controlled on the Operator Level.
                    c.      Programming Level can have the ability to update program code and everything
                            else.
      2. The program indicates three levels of alarm and this information can be available both at
             the HMI and remotely.
                    a. Warning: This includes non-critical range low or high levels for process
                            equipment. For example low or high tank levels, low or high pressures,
                            temperatures or process efficiency.
                     b. Problem: This includes all critical levels for temperature, pressure, tank level and
                            process efficiency.
                    c.      Shutdown: A critical variable has exceeded its set-point and the automatic
                            equipment shutdown sequence has occurred.
             The warning level alarm conditions can be disabled at a Technical level password
             protected screen.
      3. The program can have automatic startup and shutdown sequences for both the liquid and
             gas phase C1O 2 operations. These shutdowns are triggered either by the process shutdown
             alarm or by pressing the emergency stop button. The restart after automated or
             emergency shutdown requires the operator to remedy any alarm conditions prior to
             proceeding. This restart can have the option of using either the previous process variable
             set points or the default set points. The HMI shows what variable has triggered the alarm
             and recommend in order of likelihood, one or more suggested operator activates to
             remedy the alarm. In addition to display on the HMI, this information can be conveyed
             by email to selected individuals who require or need notification.
      4. The program supports data logged in a discrete way (controlled behind a technical level
             password protected screen.) The data logging preferably has the ability to be remotely
             downloaded in a safe way. If encryption is easily available, that would be a plus.

       5. The controller sends a 4-20 mA signal to the ClO 2 generator that is used to regulate the
             rate of ClO 2 production by the generator. The value of this signal (AO-i) can be
             determined by comparing the analog inputs from two separate sensors: NOx and CIO2 .
             Both sensors measure their respective process variables from exhaust gas at a point after
             the second stage scrubber. Both of the sensors convey analytical data that represents the
             concentrations of their measured gas via loop powered 4-20 mA signals. The controller
             provides 24V DC power to each gas transmitter and the transmitter superimposes a 4-20
             mA signal on this loop.
      6. The analog output AO-1 from the controller utilizes "if then" logic that is based on the
             following parameters:
                    a. Analog data from the NOx (AI-i) and ClG 2 (AI-2) sensor are independently
                            averaged. The averaging period duration is changed on a screen that is protected
                            by the Technical Level password.
                     b. There can be a set point for maximum ClO in the waste gas stream. This set point
                            can be changed at the Technical Level.
                    c.      There can be a set point for the maximum NOx in the exhaust gas. This can be
                            changed at the Operator Level.
                    d. If there are no alarms (system is operating properly) and both sensors are at no
                            detect then the first stage scrubbing system is optimally tuned.
                    e.      If the NOx sensor is at no-detect and the CO   2 is detecting then turn down the cO 2
                            generation until the reported averaged sensor value is less than the set point for
                            average NOx in the waste gas stream.
                    f. If the NOx sensor is reading above the average NOx set point then increase the
                            CO 2   generator output until the NOx level is below the average NOx set point.
                    g.      If both the ClG 2 and NOx are above their average set points then the ClG 2
                            generation is rapidly increased (accelerated PID ramp up rate) and a warning
                            alarm is triggered. This alarm automatically resets when the condition is resolved.
      7. The controller sends a 4-20 mA signal (AO-2) to the DP lo 2 generator tank identified as
             5-53-TK. (NaOH) metering pump. The pH sensors convey their measured variable via
             loop powered 4-20 mA signals. The controller provides 24V DC power to the pH
             transmitter and the transmitter superimposes a 4-20 mA signal on this loop.
                                                              -31

                    a. This metering pump can be connected to the discharge point in the waste tank 5
                            53-TK.
                    b. It is recommended that the tank's 5-55-TK size to be increased to 300 gallons or
                            larger.
                    c.      Waste RO water should go directly to a drain rather than be included with the
                            catholyte and analyte waste streams.
                    d. See #9 - 11 below for more information pertaining to tank 5-55-TK.
       8. The controller sends a 4-20 mA signal (AO-3) to the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) metering
             pump. The pH sensors convey their measured variable via loop powered 4-20 mA
             signals. The controller provides 24V DC power to the pH transmitter and the transmitter
             superimposes a 4-20 mA signal on this loop.
                    a. This metering pump can be connected to a source of 50% sodium hydroxide
                            solution.
      9. The pH set point of the second stage scrubber sump can be maintained by utilizing a
             combination of both sodium hydroxide sources.
                    a.      The generator tank 5-53-TK can be used first.
                    b. If this pump is operating at full capacity and the pH set point is still not met then
                            the second chemical metering pump connected to the 50% NaOH can be
                            progressively increased until the set point is reached.
       10. Three digital sensors are preferably installed on the C1O 2 generator cell waste liquid tank
             (5-53-TK) a low, a medium-high and high-high.
                    a. The PLC utilizes the low and the medium high to regulate waste transfer pump 5
                            55-PU. This liquid is preferably transferred to another location.
                    b. The PLC utilizes the high-high as part of the "problem" level alarm condition
                            logic.
       11. A second discharge port is preferably installed from tank 5-53-TK. This can be made
             available to a chemical metering pump supplied as part of the equipment. This fitting can
             have a manual shut off valve and %" NPT fitting.
       12. There can be a digital level sensor on the external liquid CIO- tank. When this level is
             reached the C10          2 generator is shut off and shutdown alarm is triggered. This tank is not
             used initially so the contact can be bypasses.

       13. Ideally the generator preferably has the ability to control concentration of ClO2 being
             delivered in gas phase by two methods:
                    a. Changing the power to the cells.
                    b. Changing the rate of gas flowing through the cell or diverting a percentage of the
                           ClO 2   laden gas into a bubbler that stores it in water. The second activity improves
                           the speed of process control and minimize over or under feeding ClO 2 into the
                           first stage scrubber.
       14. The generator sends the following digital signals to the controller. All signals can be 24
             volt DC and loop powered from the control panel:
                    a. The generator is on and operating in the gas phase CIO2 methodology (DI-1)
                    b. The generator is on and operating in the liquid phase CIO2 methodology (DI-2)
                    c.     There is a Warning level alarm. Alarms that are in this category can be defined
                           (DI-3).
                    d. There is a Problem level alarm. Alarms that are in this category can be defined
                           (DI-4).
                    e.     The generator is shutting down due to a shutdown level alarm condition (DI-5).
                    f. The generator is shutting down due to manual command. (DI-6).
                    g. Once the available analog and digital data generated in the Generator / PLC then
                           some of these may be sent to the controller as inputs.
       15. Each process variable can be graphically displayed next to a comparable bar chart that
             shows the set point for that variable.

of waste streams liquid from the generator and the addition of 50% sodium hydroxide liquid. All
liquids can be introduced directly into the scrubber sump as described in #7-9 above.
             [0139]               Cleaning follows a policy of draining and re-filling the scrubber sump twice
per week and manually maintaining the scrubber liquid level between water changes. Provide
normally closed input (DI-8) in the event a sump water level sensor is included for sump water
level.
             [01401               The recirculation pumps for the second stage scrubber are necessary in this
embodiment. The transmitters are manual at this time and are expected to remain manual so there
is no need to include inputs from automated alarms.
             [01411               There are two fans associated with this contemplated scrubber. One is on/off
and the other is controlled with a variable frequency drive. It is essential that air is moving
through the ducting while ClO 2 is being introduced to the waste gas. Therefore a gas flow
sensors is required.
             [0142]               A normally closed gas flow sensor (DI-10) can be installed in the waste gas
stream after the second stage. If this does not indicate gas flow when at least one fan is on then a
Shutdown level alarm is immediately triggered. There can be a 10 second delay after fan start
before this alarm condition becomes active.

             [0147]              With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms
herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the
singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application.                           The various
singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity. The indefinite
article "a" or "an" does not exclude a plurality. A single processor or other unit may fulfill the
functions of several items recited in the claims. The mere fact that certain measures are recited in
mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures
cannot be used to advantage. Any reference signs in the claims should not be construed as
limiting the scope.
             [0148]              It is further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an
introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent is explicitly recited in the claim, and in the
absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the
following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases "at least one" and "one
or more" to introduce claim recitations.                    However, the use of such phrases should not be
construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles "a" or "an"
limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments
containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases
''one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or "an" (e.g., "a" and/or "an"
should typically be interpreted to mean "at least one" or "one or more"); the same holds true for
the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific
number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will
recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number
(e.g., the bare recitation of "two recitations," without other modifiers, typically means at least
two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention
analogous to "at least one of A, B, and C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended
in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having
at least one of A, B, and C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B
alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C
together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, or C,
etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art
would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, or C" would

those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more
alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, are preferably understood to
contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For
example, the phrase "A or B" is understood to include the possibilities of "A" or "B" or "A and
B."

'about.'        Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth herein
are approximations that may vaiy depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained.
At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to
the scope of any claims in any application claiming priority to the present application, each
numerical parameter are preferably construed in light of the number of significant digits and
ordinary rounding approaches.
