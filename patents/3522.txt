Multi Pitch Roof Bracket Description
Outline of product
The multi pitch roof bracket has been designed to be mounted on the roof of buildings, to allow equipment such as refrigeration and air
conditioning condensers to be mounted safely. The design feature that sets this bracket apart from others isthat it can be adjusted to
maintain a level platform on any pitch of roof from 0 degrees to 10 degrees (option to go to greater than 10 degree pitch with additional
parts). Previously to get a level platform the pitch of the roof would have to be calculated and then the bracket drawn up. This would then
be taken to a sheet metal fabrication manufacture to produce which can take days. The multi pitch roof bracket is designed to be
purchased off the shelf, ready to be installed on any angle of roof. The multi pitch roof bracket is powder coated giving it long lasting
weather protection.
Specifications
The multi pitch roof bracket consists of three main components
      -     Base bracket- This isthe part of the bracket that sits on the roof and is connected to the roof structure. It is 1500mm long x
            110mm wide. The bracket is 150mm high at one end and 75mm at the other. When this bracket sits on a 3 degree roof it will
            create a level platform due to the different heights at each end. The base bracket has multiple holes over the bracket for the
            top bracket to be fixed onto the base bracket. The specific location of the bolts isdetermined by the pitch of the roof.
      -     Top bracket- This bracket sits on top of the base bracket and is fixed to the base bracket using two bolts in the pivot holes. This
            allows the top bracket to pivot up and down. The bracket is 1000mm long and 115mm wide. The bracket is 150mm high at one
            end and 75mm at the other. The bracket has holes drilled in the side so that when the bracket is pivoted on the base bracket
            and level two bolts can be installed to secure the top bracket.
      -     Large washer and stud- This is installed between the base and top bracket. The stud pokes out through the top bracket allowing
            for the equipment to be secured to the bracket. This item is moveable so that different sizes of equipment can be secured onto
            the bracket. The washer is 100mm square so that when it istightened it will not spin allowing for the equipment to be secured
            safely.
How it isto be used
The base bracket sits on the roof. It has specific holes drilled into the side of the bracket to allow for different set ups. The pivot hole is
where the base bracket and top bracket are connected using two bolts. After installing the top bracket onto the base bracket, the top
bracket can then be lifted up and down until it is level. Once the top bracket is level install two bolts into the corresponding holes to
secure. You will end up with the base bracket sitting on the roof and the top bracket hinged off the base bracket creating a level platform
for the equipment to be mounted. The bracket should then be secured to the roof using appropriate fixings, ensuring that fixings create
water tight seal. The bracket isthen ready for the equipment to be lifted onto the level platform. There isa fixed threaded stud at one end
of the top bracket that the equipment's leg/foot should be fixed to so it can be secured to the bracket. Then the large stud and washer can
be used to fix the other foot of the equipment to the bracket us a nut and washer. Tighten all nuts.
