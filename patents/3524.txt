           STEADY-STATE GEAR STRUCTURE FOR ROLLER SHADE
              The present innovation relates to a gear structure and, more
   particularly, to a gear structure for a roller shade.
              A conventional roller shade comprises a transverse mandrel, an
 5 elastic return mechanism connected with the transverse mandrel, and a shading
   face wound around the transverse mandrel. In operation, when the shading face
   is pulled downward and unwound from the transverse mandrel to reach a
   determined position, the elastic return mechanism stores a returning force. On
   the contrary, when the user wishes to wind the shading face, the shading face is
10 rolled upward by the returning force of the elastic return mechanism and
   wound around the transverse mandrel. However, the elastic return mechanism
   has a determined torque to overcome the gravity of the roller shade, so that
   when the roller shade has a heavier weight, the torque of the elastic return
   mechanism cannot withstand the weight of the roller shade. Thus, the elastic
15 return mechanism is not available for a roller shade with a heavier weight. In
   addition, the elastic return mechanism is mounted on a side of the roller to
   provide a torque to drive the roller shade, so that the elastic return mechanism
   is not operated steadily. Further, the elastic return mechanism is not assembled
   and disassembled easily and conveniently.
20            The primary objective of the present innovation is to provide a
   steady-state gear structure functioning as a power return mechanism for a
   roller shade.
                                             1

   defining a receiving chamber which has a bottom provided with a first
   mounting portion and has a side provided with a second mounting portion. The
   side bracket has a surface provided with an opening. The side bracket is
 5 provided with an extension. The first driven gear set has a center provided with

   with the second gear of the second wheel. The second driven gear set has a
10 center provided with a second spindle rotatably mounted on the second
   mounting portion of the side bracket. The second driven gear set includes an
   engaging portion and a second bevel gear connected with the engaging portion.
   The second bevel gear of the second driven gear set meshes with the first bevel
   gear of the first driven gear set. The driving member is rotatably mounted on
15 the extension of the side bracket. The driving member has a first end provided
   with a driving portion engaging the transmission member and a second end
   provided with a connecting portion. The transmission member is mounted on

   driving portion 251 of the driving member 25 is a toothed face, and the
   transmission member 24 is a toothed belt mounted between the engaging
   portion 233 of the second driven gear set 23 and the driving portion 251 of the

             In the preferred embodiment of the present innovation, the bottom
   plate 114 and the cover 115 of the housing 11 are combined by screwing,
   locking or adhering.
20           In the preferred embodiment of the present innovation, the side
   bracket 21 of the power transmission unit 2 includes a base 215 and a cap 216
   combined with the base 215.
                                           8

              In the preferred embodiment of the present innovation, the base 215
   and the cap 216 of the side bracket 21 are combined by screwing, locking or
   adhering.
              In another preferred embodiment of the present innovation, the gear
 5 structure comprises a plurality of return wheel units 1 connected serially. In
   assembly, the second gear 133 of the second wheel 13 of one of the return
   wheel units 1 meshes with the first gear 123 of the first wheel 12 of another one
   of the return wheel units 1.
              In operation, referring to FIGS. 4 and 5 with reference to FIGS. 1-3,
10 the first wheel 12 is rotatably mounted on one of the two fitting portions 111,
   the second wheel 13 is rotatably mounted on the other one of the two fitting
   portions 111, and the spring 14 is wound around the first wheel 12, with the
   distal end 141 of the spring 14 being secured to the second wheel 13. In such a
   manner, when the second wheel 13 is rotated in a determined direction, the
15 distal end 141 of the spring 14 is pulled by rotation of the second wheel 13 to
   wind the spring 14 around the second wheel 13 and to unwind the spring 14
   from the first wheel 12, so as to restore a returning torque.
              The first driven gear set 22 is rotatably mounted on the first mounting
   portion 213 of the side bracket 21, and the second driven gear set 23 is
20 rotatably mounted on the second mounting portion 214 of the side bracket 21
   and is perpendicular to the first driven gear set 22. In such a manner, the second
   bevel gear 232 of the second driven gear set 23 meshes with the first bevel gear
                                              9

   223 of the first driven gear set 22, so as to change the direction of rotation. The
   third gear 222 of the first driven gear set 22 meshes with the second gear 133 of
   the second wheel 13, so that the torque produced by the at least one return
   wheel unit 1 is transmitted by the second gear 133 of the second wheel 13 and
 5 the third gear 222 of the first driven gear set 22. The transmission member 24 is
   mounted between the engaging portion 233 of the second driven gear set 23
   and the driving portion 251 of the driving member 25. The roller shade
   includes a transverse mandrel combined with the connecting portion 252 of the
   driving member 25 and a shading face mounted on the transverse mandrel. In
10 such a manner, when the shading face of the roller shade is lowered, the
   transverse mandrel of the roller shade is rotated in one direction as shown in
   FIG. 4 to drive the driving member 25 which is rotated to drive the
   transmission member 24 which rotates the second driven gear set 23 which
   rotates the first driven gear set 22 which rotates the second wheel 13 which
15 pulls the spring 14 which rotates the first wheel 12, so that the spring 14 is
   unwound from the first wheel 12, so as to restore a returning torque. On the
   contrary, when the shading face of the roller shade is lifted, the first wheel 12 is
   rotated by the returning torque, and the spring 14 is wound around the first
   wheel 12, to rotate the second wheel 13 which rotates the first driven gear set
20 22 which rotates the second driven gear set 23 which drives the transmission
   member 24 which rotates the driving member 25 which rotates the transverse
   mandrel of the roller shade in the other direction as shown in FIG. 5, so as to lift
                                             10

   the shading face of the roller shade. Thus, the power transmission unit 2
   transmits the power so that the shading face of the roller shade is lifted and
   lowered steadily and stably.
             In practice, the gear structure is mounted on a side of the roller shade
 5 to function as a torsion device for winding the roller shade. When the roller
   shade is pulled downward, the power transmission unit 2 transmits the power,
   and the at least one return wheel unit 1 restores the returning torque. When the
   roller shade is rolled upward, the returning torque of the at least one return
   wheel unit 1 aids the upward rolling of the roller shade. In such a manner, the
10 roller shade is wound and unwound smoothly and conveniently by operation of
   the power transmission unit 2.
             As shown in FIG. 6, the engaging portion 233 of the second driven
   gear set 23 is a gear, the driving portion 251 of the driving member 25 is a gear,
   and the transmission member 24 includes a plurality of gears intermeshing the
15 engaging portion 233 of the second driven gear set 23 and the driving portion
   251 of the driving member 25.
             Referring to FIGS. 7 and 8, the gear structure comprises a single
   return wheel unit 1. The return wheel unit 1 has a determined torque. When the
   roller shade has a heavier weight, the number of the return wheel unit 1 is
20 increased to enhance the whole torque to withstand the gravity of the roller
   shade.
                                             11

              Referring to FIGS. 9 and 10 with reference to FIGS. 1-3, the gear
   structure comprises a plurality of return wheel units 1 connected serially. At
   this time, the first gear 123 of the first wheel 12 of each of the return wheel
   units 1 protrudes outward from the first passage 113 of the housing 11, and the
 5 second gear 133 of the second wheel 13 of each of the return wheel units 1
   protrudes outward from the second passage 112 of the housing 11. In assembly,
   the first gear 123 of the first wheel 12 of one of the return wheel units 1 meshes
   with the second gear 133 of the second wheel 13 of another one of the return
   wheel units 1. In such a manner, the return wheel units 1 are connected
10 successively, so that when one of the return wheel units 1 is rotated, another
   one of the return wheel units 1 is also rotated. Thus, the torque values of the
   springs 14 of the return wheel units 1 are accumulated to increase the total
   torque of the gear structure. Therefore, when the return wheel units 1 are
   connected serially, the total torque of the gear structure is regulated to fit roller
15 shades of different kinds and weights, so that the gear structure does not need
   to provide torque devices of different specifications. In addition, the power
   transmission unit 2 transmits the power so that the gear structure is operated
   more conveniently.
              Accordingly, the first gear 123 of the first wheel 12 of one of the
20 return wheel units 1 meshes with the second gear 133 of the second wheel 13
   of another one of the return wheel units 1, so that the return wheel units 1 are
   connected successively, to increase the total torque of the gear structure. In
                                             12

   addition, the return wheel units 1 are connected serially to regulate the total
   torque of the gear structure so that the gear structure is available for roller
   shades of different kinds and specifications. Further, the power transmission
   unit 2 transmits the power so that the gear structure is operated steadily and
 5 stably. Further, the user only needs to change the number of the return wheel
   units 1 to fit roller shades of different weights, without having to replace the
   gear structure. Further, the gear structure is assembled and disassembled easily
   and conveniently.
             The terms "comprise(s)"         and "comprising" as used in the
10 specification and claims mean "consisting at least in part of', that is to say
   when interpreting statements in the specification and claims which include any
   of those terms, the features, prefaced by any of those terms in each statement,
   all need to be present but other features can also be present.
             Throughout the specification, unless the context requires otherwise,
15 the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will
   be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but
   not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.
             Although the innovation has been explained in relation to its
   preferred embodiment(s) as mentioned above, it is to be understood that many
20 other possible modifications and variations can be made without departing
   from the scope of the present innovation. It is, therefore, contemplated that the
                                            13

appended claim or claims will cover such modifications and variations that fall
