                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases,
is a key signaling enzyme expressed in all hematopoietic cells types except T lymphocytes
and natural killer cells. Btk plays an essential role in the B-cell signaling pathway linking cell
surface B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation to downstream intracellular responses.
Btk is a key regulator of B-cell development, activation, signaling, and survival (Kurosaki,
Curr Op Imm, 2000, 276-28 1; Schaeffer and Schwartzberg, Curr Op Imm 2000, 282-288). In
addition, Btk plays a role in a number of other hematopoietic cell signaling pathways, e.g.,
Toll like receptor (TLR) and cytokine receptor-mediated TNF-a production in macrophages,
IgE receptor (FcRI) signaling in Mast cells, inhibition of Fas/APO-1 apoptotic signaling in
B-lineage lymphoid cells, and collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation. See, e.g., C. A.

time point by cycle number and day in the X axis. All Patients (except Pt 32009) were treated on
schedule of 4 weeks on treatment followed by one week off Thus, dayl of each cycle follows
one week off drug for these patients. Note the increases of ALC during most cycles of most
patients, and the fall of ALC at the beginning of subsequent cycles. This pattern is often blunted
in later cycles as patients responded to treatment. Patient 32009 received treatment without
interruption and did not show this cyclic pattern, but did show an increase at Cycle 1, day15, and
gradual increases during Cycles 2 to 5.

initially was stable but later had Progressive Disease (PD).

after administering a Btk inhibitor to PD individuals with follicular lymphoma. The Y Axis
shows the Absolute Lymphocyte Counts (ALC) at each time point by cycle number and day in
the X axis. All Patients except 38010 were treated on schedule of 4 weeks on treatment followed
by one week off Thus, dayl of each cycle follows one week off drug for these patients. Note
lack of mobilization, especially patients 38010 and 32001. Patient 323001 had limited treatment
before being taken off study. The lymphocyte response suggests that this patient might had
responded if it had been possible to stay on treatment longer.

after administering a Btk inhibitor to the individuals with mantle cell lymphoma shown in
Figure 12. The axis has been changed, as compared to Fig. 12, to demonstrate low amplitude
fluctuations. Note that all responding patients showed some degree of mobilization.
[0029]          Figure 15 demonstrates that lymphocyte mobilization, specifically B Cell type,
consistent with lymphoma cells, decreases as disease responds. Patient 32007, Cohort 4, had
follicular lymphoma, grade 3, which gradually regressed from SD to CR. Although the changes
of ALC in this case are not dramatic, the B cell fraction is undergoing characteristic cyclic
increases in response to treatment with a Btk inhibitor. Also note the decreasing cycle by cycle
magnitude of shifts consistent with cumulative disease control.
[0030]          Figure 16 demonstrates that there is increased B Cell mobilization with disease
progression. Patient 32004, Cohort 2, had follicular lymphoma, grade 1, which progressed from
SD initially to PD following Cycle 6.
[0031]          Figure 17 depicts early mobilization and eventual decrease of a CD45DIM B cell
subpopulation in responding mantle cell lymphoma patient 200-005. This subpopulation has a
typical MCL immunophenotype (CD45 Dim) and is different than that of normal lymphocytes.

panels were gated upon and their CD3 vs CD19 staining displayed in the lower panels. Here the
putative malignant cells were "hidden" in the large MNC window normally defining monocytes.
The sequence of mobilization followed by response is similar to other examples.

way of example only, "C1 -C4 alkyl" indicates that there are one to four carbon atoms in the alkyl
chain, i.e., the alkyl chain is selected from among methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso
butyl, sec-butyl, and t-butyl. Thus C1-C 4 alkyl includes CI-C     2 alkyl and CI-C 3 alkyl. Alkyl
groups can be substituted or unsubstituted. Typical alkyl groups include, but are in no way
limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl, hexyl, ethenyl,
propenyl, butenyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and the like.
[0072]            As used herein, the term "non-cyclic alkyl" refers to an alkyl that is not cyclic

fully saturated or can contain non-cyclic alkenes and/or alkynes. Non-cyclic alkyls can be
optionally substituted.
[00731            The term "alkenyl" refers to a type of alkyl group in which the first two atoms of
the alkyl group form a double bond that is not part of an aromatic group. That is, an alkenyl
group begins with the atoms -C(R)=C(R)-R, wherein R refers to the remaining portions of the
alkenyl group, which may be the same or different. The alkenyl moiety may be branched,
straight chain, or cyclic (in which case, it would also be known as a "cycloalkenyl" group).
Depending on the structure, an alkenyl group can be a monoradical or a diradical (i.e., an
alkenylene group). Alkenyl groups can be optionally substituted. Non-limiting examples of an
alkenyl group include -CH=CH 2, -C(CH 3)=CH 2 , -CH=CHCH 3, -C(CH 3)=CHCH 3. Alkenylene
groups include, but are not limited to, -CH=CH-, -C(CH 3 )=CH-, -CH=CHCH 2-,
CH=CHCH 2CH 2- and -C(CH 3 )=CHCH 2-. Alkenyl groups could have 2 to 10 carbons. The
alkenyl group could also be a "lower alkenyl" having 2 to 6 carbon atoms.
[0074]            The term "alkynyl" refers to a type of alkyl group in which the first two atoms of
the alkyl group form a triple bond. That is, an alkynyl group begins with the atoms -C--C-R,

different. The "R" portion of the alkynyl moiety may be branched, straight chain, or cyclic.
Depending on the structure, an alkynyl group can be a monoradical or a diradical (i.e., an
alkynylene group). Alkynyl groups can be optionally substituted. Non-limiting examples of an
alkynyl group include, but are not limited to, -C--CH, -C--CCH 3 , -C--CCH 2 CH 3, -C--C-, and

cycloalkyls and non-aromatic heterocycles). Rings can be optionally substituted. Rings can be
monocyclic or polycyclic.
[0084]           As used herein, the term "ring system" refers to one, or more than one ring.
[00851           The term "membered ring" can embrace any cyclic structure. The term
"membered" is meant to denote the number of skeletal atoms that constitute the ring. Thus, for
example, cyclohexyl, pyridine, pyran and thiopyran are 6-membered rings and cyclopentyl,
pyrrole, furan, and thiophene are 5-membered rings.
[00861           The term "fused" refers to structures in which two or more rings share one or
more bonds.
[00871           The term "carbocyclic" or "carbocycle" refers to a ring wherein each of the atoms
forming the ring is a carbon atom. Carbocycle includes aryl and cycloalkyl. The term thus
distinguishes carbocycle from heterocycle ("heterocyclic") in which the ring backbone contains
at least one atom which is different from carbon (i.e. a heteroatom). Heterocycle includes
heteroaryl and heterocycloalkyl. Carbocycles and heterocycles can be optionally substituted.
[00881           The term "aromatic" refers to a planar ring having a delocalized it-electron
system containing 4n+2     it electrons, where n is an integer. Aromatic rings can be formed from
five, six, seven, eight, nine, or more than nine atoms. Aromatics can be optionally substituted.
The term "aromatic" includes both carbocyclic aryl (e.g., phenyl) and heterocyclic aryl (or
"heteroaryl" or "heteroaromatic") groups (e.g., pyridine). The term includes monocyclic or
fused-ring polycyclic (i.e., rings which share adjacent pairs of carbon atoms) groups.
[00891           As used herein, the term "aryl" refers to an aromatic ring wherein each of the
atoms forming the ring is a carbon atom. Aryl rings can be formed by five, six, seven, eight,
nine, or more than nine carbon atoms. Aryl groups can be optionally substituted. Examples of
aryl groups include, but are not limited to phenyl, naphthalenyl, phenanthrenyl, anthracenyl,
fluorenyl, and indenyl. Depending on the structure, an aryl group can be a monoradical or a
diradical (i.e., an arylene group).

structure, a cycloalkyl group can be a monoradical or a diradical (e.g., an cycloalkylene group).
The cycloalkyl group could also be a "lower cycloalkyl" having 3 to 8 carbon atoms.
[00951           "Cycloalkylalkyl" means an alkyl radical, as defined herein, substituted with a
cycloalkyl group. Non-limiting cycloalkylalkyl groups include cyclopropylmethyl,
cyclobutylmethyl, cyclopentylmethyl, cyclohexylmethyl, and the like.
[00961           The term "heterocycle" refers to heteroaromatic and heteroalicyclic groups
containing one to four heteroatoms each selected from 0, S and N, wherein each heterocyclic
group has from 4 to 10 atoms in its ring system, and with the proviso that the ring of said group
does not contain two adjacent 0 or S atoms. Herein, whenever the number of carbon atoms in a
heterocycle is indicated (e.g., C 1-C6 heterocycle), at least one other atom (the heteroatom) must
be present in the ring. Designations such as "C1-C6 heterocycle" refer only to the number of
carbon atoms in the ring and do not refer to the total number of atoms in the ring. It is
understood that the heterocylic ring can have additional heteroatoms in the ring. Designations
such as "4-6 membered heterocycle" refer to the total number of atoms that are contained in the
ring (i.e., a four, five, or six membered ring, in which at least one atom is a carbon atom, at least
one atom is a heteroatom and the remaining two to four atoms are either carbon atoms or
heteroatoms). In heterocycles that have two or more heteroatoms, those two or more
heteroatoms can be the same or different from one another. Heterocycles can be optionally
substituted. Binding to a heterocycle can be at a heteroatom or via a carbon atom. Non-aromatic
heterocyclic groups include groups having only 4 atoms in their ring system, but aromatic
heterocyclic groups must have at least 5 atoms in their ring system. The heterocyclic groups
include benzo-fused ring systems. An example of a 4-membered heterocyclic group is azetidinyl
                                                    - 42 -

quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, naphthyridinyl, and furopyridinyl. The foregoing groups, as derived
from the groups listed above, may be C-attached or N-attached where such is possible. For
instance, a group derived from pyrrole may be pyrrol-I-yl (N-attached) or pyrrol-3-yl (C
attached). Further, a group derived from imidazole may be imidazol-1-yl or imidazol-3-yl (both
N-attached) or imidazol-2-yl, imidazol-4-yl or imidazol-5-yl (all C-attached). The heterocyclic
groups include benzo-fused ring systems and ring systems substituted with one or two oxo (=0)
moieties such as pyrrolidin-2-one. Depending on the structure, a heterocycle group can be a
monoradical or a diradical (i.e., a heterocyclene group).
[00971          The terms "heteroaryl" or, alternatively, "heteroaromatic" refers to an aryl group

(bonded through a ring carbon) and non-aromatic heterocycle (bonded through a ring carbon).
[00128]         The term "optionally substituted" or "substituted" means that the referenced
group may be substituted with one or more additional group(s) individually and independently
selected from alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heteroalicyclic, hydroxy, alkoxy, aryloxy,
alkylthio, arylthio, alkylsulfoxide, arylsulfoxide, alkylsulfone, arylsulfone, cyano, halo, acyl,

independently selected from H, (substituted or unsubstituted CI-C 4alkyl), (substituted or
unsubstituted C3 -C6 cycloalkyl), heteroaryl, or heteroalkyl. The protecting groups that may form
the protective derivatives of the above substituents are known to those of skill in the art and may
be found in references such as Greene and Wuts, above.
[00129]         The term "Michael acceptor moiety" refers to a functional group that can
participate in a Michael reaction, wherein a new covalent bond is formed between a portion of
the Michael acceptor moiety and the donor moiety. The Michael acceptor moiety is an
electrophile and the "donor moiety" is a nucleophile.
[001301         The term "nucleophile" or "nucleophilic" refers to an electron rich compound, or
moiety thereof An example of a nucleophile includes, but in no way is limited to, a cysteine
residue of a molecule, such as, for example Cys 481 of Btk.
[001311         The term "electrophile", or "electrophilic" refers to an electron poor or electron
deficient molecule, or moiety thereof Examples of electrophiles include, but in no way are
limited to, Michael acceptor moieties.
[00132]         The term "acceptable" or "pharmaceutically acceptable", with respect to a
formulation, composition or ingredient, as used herein, means having no persistent detrimental
effect on the general health of the subject being treated or does not abrogate the biological
activity or properties of the compound, and is relatively nontoxic.
[001331         "B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (BCLD) biomarkers", as used herein, refer
to any biological molecule (found either in blood, other body fluids, or tissues) or any
chromosomal abnormality that is a sign of a BCLD-related condition or disease.
[00134]         "Tumor," as used herein, refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation,
whether malignant or benign, and all pre-cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues.
"Neoplastic," as used herein, refers to any form of dysregulated or unregulated cell growth,
whether malignant or benign, resulting in abnormal tissue growth. Thus, "neoplastic cells"
include malignant and benign cells having dysregulated or unregulated cell growth.
[001351         The terms "cancer" and "cancerous" refer to or describe the physiological
condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of
cancer include, but are not limited to, B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (BCLDs), such as
lymphoma and leukemia, and solid tumors. By "B cell-related cancer" or "cancer of B-cell
                                                   - 47 -

lineage" is intended any type of cancer in which the dysregulated or unregulated cell growth is
associated with B cells.
[001361          By "refractory" in the context of a cancer is intended the particular cancer is
resistant to, or non-responsive to, therapy with a particular therapeutic agent. A cancer can be
refractory to therapy with a particular therapeutic agent either from the onset of treatment with
the particular therapeutic agent (i.e., non-responsive to initial exposure to the therapeutic agent),
or as a result of developing resistance to the therapeutic agent, either over the course of a first
treatment period with the therapeutic agent or during a subsequent treatment period with the
therapeutic agent.
[001371          By "agonist activity" is intended that a substance functions as an agonist. An
agonist combines with a receptor on a cell and initiates a reaction or activity that is similar to or
the same as that initiated by the receptor's natural ligand.
[00138]           By "antagonist activity" is intended that the substance functions as an antagonist.
An antagonist of Btk prevents or reduces induction of any of the responses mediated by Btk.
[00139]          By "significant" agonist activity is intended an agonist activity of at least 30%,
35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 100% greater than the agonist
activity induced by a neutral substance or negative control as measured in an assay of a B cell
response. Preferably, "significant" agonist activity is an agonist activity that is at least 2-fold
greater or at least 3-fold greater than the agonist activity induced by a neutral substance or
negative control as measured in an assay of a B cell response. Thus, for example, where the B
cell response of interest is B cell proliferation, "significant" agonist activity would be induction
of a level of B cell proliferation that is at least 2-fold greater or at least 3-fold greater than the
level of B cell proliferation induced by a neutral substance or negative control.
[00140]          A substance "free of significant agonist activity" would exhibit an agonist
activity of not more than about 25% greater than the agonist activity induced by a neutral
substance or negative control, preferably not more than about 20% greater, 15% greater, 10%
greater, 5% greater, 1% greater, 0.5% greater, or even not more than about 0.l1% greater than the
agonist activity induced by a neutral substance or negative control as measured in an assay of a
B cell response.
[00141]          In some embodiments, the Btk inhibitor therapeutic agent is an antagonist anti
Btk antibody. Such antibodies are free of significant agonist activity as noted above when bound
to a Btk antigen in a human cell. In one embodiment of the invention, the antagonist anti-Btk
antibody is free of significant agonist activity in one cellular response. In another embodiment of
the invention, the antagonist anti-Btk antibody is free of significant agonist activity in assays of
                                                      - 48 -

more than one cellular response (e.g., proliferation and differentiation, or proliferation,
differentiation, and, for B cells, antibody production).
[00142]          By "Btk-mediated signaling" it is intended any of the biological activities that are
dependent on, either directly or indirection, the activity of Btk. Examples of Btk-mediated
signaling are signals that lead to proliferation and survival of Btk-expressing cells, and
stimulation of one or more Btk-signaling pathways within Btk-expressing cells.
[00143]          A Btk "signaling pathway" or "signal transduction pathway" is intended to mean
at least one biochemical reaction, or a group of biochemical reactions, that results from the
activity of Btk, and which generates a signal that, when transmitted through the signal pathway,
leads to activation of one or more downstream molecules in the signaling cascade. Signal
transduction pathways involve a number of signal transduction molecules that lead to
transmission of a signal from the cell-surface across the plasma membrane of a cell, and through
one or more in a series of signal transduction molecules, through the cytoplasm of the cell, and
in some instances, into the cell's nucleus. Of particular interest to the present invention are Btk
signal transduction pathways which ultimately regulate (either enhance or inhibit) the activation
of NF-wB via the NF-wB signaling pathway.
[00144]          The methods of the present invention are directed to methods for treating cancer
that, in certain embodiments, utilize antibodies for determining the expression or presence of
certain BCLD biomarkers in these methods. The following terms and definitions apply to such
antibodies.
[001451          "Antibodies" and "immunoglobulins" (Igs) are glycoproteins having the same
structural characteristics. The terms are used synonymously. In some instances the antigen
specificity of the immunoglobulin may be known.
[00146]          The term "antibody" is used in the broadest sense and covers fully assembled
antibodies, antibody fragments that can bind antigen (e.g., Fab, F(ab') 2 , Fv, single chain
antibodies, diabodies, antibody chimeras, hybrid antibodies, bispecific antibodies, humanized
antibodies, and the like), and recombinant peptides comprising the forgoing.
[001471          The terms "monoclonal antibody" and "mAb" as used herein refer to an antibody
obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, i.e., the individual
antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring
mutations that may be present in minor amounts.
[00148]          Native antibodies" and "native immunoglobulins" are usually heterotetrameric
glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two
identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide
bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different
                                                   - 49 -

immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain
disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number
of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant
domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant
domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable
domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface
between the light and heavy-chain variable domains.
[00149]          The term "variable" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains
differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. Variable regions confer antigen-binding
specificity. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of
antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions
(CDRs) or hypervariable regions, both in the light chain and the heavy-chain variable domains.
The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are celled in the framework (FR)
regions. The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions,
largely adopting a -pleated-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops
connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the P-pleated-sheet structure. The CDRs in each
chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs from the other
chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see, Kabat et al.
(1991) NIH PubL. No. 91-3242, Vol. I, pages 647-669). The constant domains are not involved
directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as Fc
receptor (FcR) binding, participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity,
initiation of complement dependent cytotoxicity, and mast cell degranulation.
[001501          The term "hypervariable region," when used herein, refers to the amino acid
residues of an antibody that are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region
comprises amino acid residues from a "complementarily determining region" or "CDR" (i.e.,
residues 24-34 (LI), 50-56 (L2), and 89-97 (L3) in the light-chain variable domain and 31-35
(H1), 50-65 (H2), and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy-chain variable domain; Kabat et al. (1991)
Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National
Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md.) and/or those residues from a "hypervariable loop" (i.e.,
residues 26-32 (LI), 50-52 (L2), and 91-96 (L3) in the light-chain variable domain and (HI), 53
55 (H2), and 96-101 (13) in the heavy chain variable domain; Clothia and Lesk, (1987) J. Mol.
Biol., 196:901-917). "Framework" or "FR" residues are those variable domain residues other
than the hypervariable region residues, as herein deemed.
[001511          "Antibody fragments" comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the
antigen-binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments
                                                   - 50 -

include Fab, Fab, F(ab')2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies (Zapata et al. (1995)
Protein Eng. 10:1057-1062); single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies
formed from antibody fragments. Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen
binding fragments, called "Fab" fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a
residual "Fc" fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment
yields an F(ab')2 fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross
linking antigen.
[00152]         "Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment that contains a complete antigen
recognition and binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain
variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs
of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL
dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However,
even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an
antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire
binding site.
[00153]         The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the
first constant domain (CHI) of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab' fragments by the
addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CHI domain including one
or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in
which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. Fab' fragments are
produced by reducing the F(ab')2 fragment's heavy chain disulfide bridge. Other chemical
couplings of antibody fragments are also known.
[00154]         The "light chains" of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species
can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (K) and lambda (X), based on
the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.
[001551         Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy
chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of
human immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further
divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl, and IgA2. The heavy
chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called
alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional
configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. Different isotypes have
different effector functions. For example, human IgGI and IgG3 isotypes have ADCC (antibody
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) activity.

[001561          The word "label" when used herein refers to a detectable compound or
composition that is conjugated directly or indirectly to the antibody so as to generate a "labeled"
antibody. The label may be detectable by itself (e.g., radioisotope labels or fluorescent labels) or,
in the case of an enzymatic label, may catalyze chemical alteration of a substrate compound or
composition that is detectable.
[001571          The term "acceptable" or "pharmaceutically acceptable", with respect to a
formulation, composition or ingredient, as used herein, means having no persistent detrimental
effect on the general health of the subject being treated or does not abrogate the biological
activity or properties of the compound, and is relatively nontoxic.
[00158]          As used herein, the term "agonist" refers to a compound, the presence of which
results in a biological activity of a protein that is the same as the biological activity resulting
from the presence of a naturally occurring ligand for the protein, such as, for example, Btk.
[001591          As used herein, the term "partial agonist" refers to a compound the presence of
which results in a biological activity of a protein that is of the same type as that resulting from
the presence of a naturally occurring ligand for the protein, but of a lower magnitude.
[00160]          As used herein, the term "antagonist" refers to a compound, the presence of
which results in a decrease in the magnitude of a biological activity of a protein. In certain
embodiments, the presence of an antagonist results in complete inhibition of a biological activity
of a protein, such as, for example, Btk. In certain embodiments, an antagonist is an inhibitor.
[00161]          The term "Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk)," as used herein, refers to Bruton's
tyrosine kinase from Homo sapiens, as disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,326,469 (GenBank
Accession No. NP_000052).
[00162]          The term "Bruton's tyrosine kinase homolog," as used herein, refers to orthologs
of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, e.g., the orthologs from mouse (GenBank Accession No.
AAB47246), dog (GenBank Accession No. XP_549139.), rat (GenBank Accession No.
NP_001007799), chicken (GenBank Accession No. NP_989564), or zebra fish (GenBank
Accession No. XP_698117), and fusion proteins of any of the foregoing that exhibit kinase
activity towards one or more substrates of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (e.g. a peptide substrate
having the amino acid sequence "AVLESEEELYSSARQ").
[00163]          The terms "co-administration" or "combination therapy" and the like, as used
herein, are meant to encompass administration of the selected therapeutic agents to a single
patient, and are intended to include treatment s in which the agents are administered by the same
or different route of administration or at the same or different time.
[00164]          The term "effective amount," as used herein, refers to a sufficient amount of a
Btk inhibitory agent or a Btk inhibitor compound being administered which will result in an
                                                     - 52 -

increase or appearance in the blood of a subpopulation of lymphocytes (e.g., pharmaceutical
debulking). For example, an "effective amount" for diagnostic and/or prognostic uses is the
amount of the composition including a compound as disclosed herein required to provide a
clinically significant decrease an increase or appearance in the blood of a subpopulation of
lymphocytes without undue adverse side effects. An appropriate "effective amount" in any
individual case may be determined using techniques, such as a dose escalation study.
 [001651        The term "therapeutically effective amount," as used herein, refers to a sufficient
amount of an agent or a compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or
more of the symptoms s B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (BCLD). The result can be
reduction and/or alleviation of the signs, symptoms, or causes of BCLD, or any other desired
alteration of a biological system. The term "therapeutically effective amount" includes, for
example, a prophylactically effective amount. An "effective amount" of a compound disclosed
herein is an amount effective to achieve a desired pharmacologic effect or therapeutic
improvement without undue adverse side effects. It is understood that "an effect amount" or "a
therapeutically effective amount" can vary from subject to subject, due to variation in
metabolism of the compound of any of Formula (A), Formula (B), Formula (C), or Formula (D),
age, weight, general condition of the subject, the condition being treated, the severity of the
condition being treated, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. By way of example only,
therapeutically effective amounts may be determined by routine experimentation, including but
not limited to a dose escalation clinical trial.
 [00166]        The terms "enhance" or "enhancing" means to increase or prolong either in
potency or duration a desired effect. By way of example, "enhancing" the effect of therapeutic
agents refers to the ability to increase or prolong, either in potency or duration, the effect of
therapeutic agents on during treatment of a disease, disorder or condition. An "enhancing
effective amount," as used herein, refers to an amount adequate to enhance the effect of a
therapeutic agent in the treatment of a disease, disorder or condition. When used in a patient,
amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or
condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the
judgment of the treating physician.
 [001671        The term "homologous cysteine," as used herein refers to a cysteine residue
found within a sequence position that is homologous to that of cysteine 481 of Bruton's tyrosine
kinase, as defined herein. For example, cysteine 482 is the homologous cysteine of the rat
ortholog of Bruton's tyrosine kinase; cysteine 479 is the homologous cysteine of the chicken
ortholog; and cysteine 481 is the homologous cysteine in the zebra fish ortholog. In another
example, the homologous cysteine of TXK, a Tec kinase family member related to Bruton's
                                                    - 53 -

tyrosine, is Cys 350. See also the sequence alignments of tyrosine kinases (TK) published on the
world wide web at kinase.com/human/kinome/phylogeny.html.
[001681          The term "identical," as used herein, refers to two or more sequences or
subsequences which are the same. In addition, the term "substantially identical," as used herein,
refers to two or more sequences which have a percentage of sequential units which are the same
when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window, or
designated region as measured using comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual
inspection. By way of example only, two or more sequences may be "substantially identical" if
the sequential units are about 60% identical, about 65% identical, about 70% identical, about
75% identical, about 80% identical, about 85% identical, about 90% identical, or about 95%
identical over a specified region. Such percentages to describe the "percent identity" of two or
more sequences. The identity of a sequence can exist over a region that is at least about 75-100
sequential units in length, over a region that is about 50 sequential units in length, or, where not
specified, across the entire sequence. This definition also refers to the complement of a test
sequence. By way of example only, two or more polypeptide sequences are identical when the
amino acid residues are the same, while two or more polypeptide sequences are "substantially
identical" if the amino acid residues are about 60% identical, about 65% identical, about 70%
identical, about 75% identical, about 80% identical, about 85% identical, about 90% identical, or
about 95% identical over a specified region. The identity can exist over a region that is at least
about 75-100 amino acids in length, over a region that is about 50 amino acids in length, or,
where not specified, across the entire sequence of a polypeptide sequence. In addition, by way of
example only, two or more polynucleotide sequences are identical when the nucleic acid
residues are the same, while two or more polynucleotide sequences are "substantially identical"
if the nucleic acid residues are about 60% identical, about 65% identical, about 70% identical,
about 75% identical, about 80% identical, about 85% identical, about 90% identical, or about
95% identical over a specified region. The identity can exist over a region that is at least about
75-100 nucleic acids in length, over a region that is about 50 nucleic acids in length, or, where
not specified, across the entire sequence of a polynucleotide sequence.
[00169]          The terms "inhibits", "inhibiting", or "inhibitor" of a kinase, as used herein, refer
to inhibition of enzymatic phosphotransferase activity.
[001701          The term "irreversible inhibitor," as used herein, refers to a compound that, upon
contact with a target protein (e.g., a kinase) causes the formation of a new covalent bond with or
within the protein, whereby one or more of the target protein's biological activities (e.g.,
phosphotransferase activity) is diminished or abolished notwithstanding the subsequent presence
or absence of the irreversible inhibitor.

[001711         The term "irreversible Btk inhibitor," as used herein, refers to an inhibitor of Btk
that can form a covalent bond with an amino acid residue of Btk. In one embodiment, the
irreversible inhibitor of Btk can form a covalent bond with a Cys residue of Btk; in particular
embodiments, the irreversible inhibitor can form a covalent bond with a Cys 481 residue (or a
homolog thereof) of Btk or a cysteine residue in the homologous corresponding position of
another tyrosine kinase.
[00172]         The term "isolated," as used herein, refers to separating and removing a
component of interest from components not of interest. Isolated substances can be in either a dry
or semi-dry state, or in solution, including but not limited to an aqueous solution. The isolated
component can be in a homogeneous state or the isolated component can be a part of a
pharmaceutical composition that comprises additional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers
and/or excipients. By way of example only, nucleic acids or proteins are "isolated" when such
nucleic acids or proteins are free of at least some of the cellular components with which it is
associated in the natural state, or that the nucleic acid or protein has been concentrated to a level
greater than the concentration of its in vivo or in vitro production. Also, by way of example, a
gene is isolated when separated from open reading frames which flank the gene and encode a
protein other than the gene of interest.
[001731         A "metabolite" of a compound disclosed herein is a derivative of that compound
that is formed when the compound is metabolized. The term "active metabolite" refers to a
biologically active derivative of a compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized.
The term "metabolized," as used herein, refers to the sum of the processes (including, but not
limited to, hydrolysis reactions and reactions catalyzed by enzymes, such as, oxidation
reactions) by which a particular substance is changed by an organism. Thus, enzymes may
produce specific structural alterations to a compound. For example, cytochrome P450 catalyzes
a variety of oxidative and reductive reactions while uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferases
catalyze the transfer of an activated glucuronic-acid molecule to aromatic alcohols, aliphatic
alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines and free sulfhydryl groups. Further information on
metabolism may be obtained from The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Edition,
McGraw-Hill (1996). Metabolites of the compounds disclosed herein can be identified either by
administration of compounds to a host and analysis of tissue samples from the host, or by
incubation of compounds with hepatic cells in vitro and analysis of the resulting compounds.
Both methods are well known in the art. In some embodiments, metabolites of a compound are
formed by oxidative processes and correspond to the corresponding hydroxy-containing

[00191]          B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (BCLDs) are neoplasms of the blood and
encompass, inter alia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia. BCLDs can
originate either in the lymphatic tissues (as in the case of lymphoma) or in the bone marrow (as
in the case of leukemia and myeloma), and they all are involved with the uncontrolled growth of
lymphocytes or white blood cells. There are many subtypes of BCLD, e.g., chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The disease course and treatment of
BCLD is dependent on the BCLD subtype; however, even within each subtype the clinical
presentation, morphologic appearance, and response to therapy is heterogeneous.
[00192]          Malignant lymphomas are neoplastic transformations of cells that reside
predominantly within lymphoid tissues. Two groups of malignant lymphomas are Hodgkin's
lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Both types of lymphomas infiltrate
reticuloendothelial tissues. However, they differ in the neoplastic cell of origin, site of disease,
presence of systemic symptoms, and response to treatment (Freedman et al., "Non-Hodgkin's
Lymphomas" Chapter 134, Cancer Medicine, (an approved publication of the American Cancer
Society, B.C. Decker Inc., Hamilton, Ontario, 2003).

[001951          Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are a diverse group of malignancies that are
predominately of B-cell origin. NHL may develop in any organs associated with lymphatic
system such as spleen, lymph nodes or tonsils and can occur at any age. NHL is often marked by
enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and weight loss. NHL is classified as either B-cell or T-cell NHL.
Lymphomas related to lymphoproliferative disorders following bone marrow or stem cell
transplantation are usually B-cell NHL. In the Working Formulation classification scheme, NHL
has been divided into low-, intermediate-, and high-grade categories by virtue of their natural
histories (see "The Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Pathologic Classification Project," Cancer
49(1982):2112-2135). The low-grade lymphomas are indolent, with a median survival of 5 to 10
years (Homing and Rosenberg (1984) N. Engl. J. Med. 311:1471-1475). Although
chemotherapy can induce remissions in the majority of indolent lymphomas, cures are rare and
most patients eventually relapse, requiring further therapy. The intermediate- and high-grade
                                                    - 63 -

lymphomas are more aggressive tumors, but they have a greater chance for cure with
chemotherapy. However, a significant proportion of these patients will relapse and require
further treatment.

[00200]          The ABC subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) is thought to
arise from post germinal center B cells that are arrested during plasmatic differentiation. The
ABC subtype of DLBCL (ABC-DLBCL) accounts for approximately 30% total DLBCL
diagnoses. It is considered the least curable of the DLBCL molecular subtypes and, as such,
patients diagnosed with the ABC-DLBCL typically display significantly reduced survival rates
compared with individuals with other types of DLCBL. ABC-DLBCL is most commonly
associated with chromosomal translocations deregulating the germinal center master regulator
                                                   - 66 -

BCL6 and with mutations inactivating the PRDM 1 gene, which encodes a transcriptional
repressor required for plasma cell differentiation.
[00201]          A particularly relevant signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of ABC-DLBCL is
the one mediated by the nuclear factor (NF)-KB transcription complex. The NF-KB family
comprises 5 members (p50, p52, p65, c-rel and RelB) that form homo- and heterodimers and
function as transcriptional factors to mediate a variety of proliferation, apoptosis, inflammatory
and immune responses and are critical for normal B-cell development and survival. NF-KB is
widely used by eukaryotic cells as a regulator of genes that control cell proliferation and cell
survival. As such, many different types of human tumors have misregulated NF-KB: that is, NF
KB  is constitutively active. Active NF-KB turns on the expression of genes that keep the cell
proliferating and protect the cell from conditions that would otherwise cause it to die via
apoptosis.
[00202]          The dependence of ABC DLBCLs on NF-KB depends on a signaling pathway
upstream of IkB kinase comprised of CARD 11, BCL10 and MALTI (the CBM complex).
Interference with the CBM pathway extinguishes NF-KB signaling in ABC DLBCL cells and
induces apoptosis. The molecular basis for constitutive activity of the NF-KB pathway is a
subject of current investigation but some somatic alterations to the genome of ABC DLBCLs
clearly invoke this pathway. For example, somatic mutations of the coiled-coil domain of
CARD 11 in DLBCL render this signaling scaffold protein able to spontaneously nucleate
protein-protein interaction with MALT 1 and BCL 10, causing IKK activity and NF-KB
activation. Constitutive activity of the B cell receptor signaling pathway has been implicated in
the activation of NF-KB in ABC DLBCLs with wild type CARD 11, and this is associated with
mutations within the cytoplasmic tails of the B cell receptor subunits CD79A and CD79B.
Oncogenic activating mutations in the signaling adapter MYD88 activate NF-KB and synergize
with B cell receptor signaling in sustaining the survival of ABC DLBCL cells. In addition,
inactivating mutations in a negative regulator of the NF-KB pathway, A20, occur almost
exclusively in ABC DLBCL.
[00203]          Indeed, genetic alterations affecting multiple components of the NF-KB signaling
pathway have been recently identified in more than 50% of ABC-DLBCL patients, where these
lesions promote constitutive NF-KB activation, thereby contributing to lymphoma growth. These
include mutations of CARD11 (~10% of the cases), a lymphocyte-specific cytoplasmic
scaffolding protein that-together with MALT1 and BCL1O-forms the BCR signalosome,
which relays signals from antigen receptors to the downstream mediators of NF-KB activation.
An even larger fraction of cases (~30%) carry biallelic genetic lesions inactivating the negative
NF-KB regulator A20. Further, high levels of expression of NF-KB target genes have been
                                                    - 67 -

[00204]          DLBCL cells of the ABC subtype, such as OCI-Ly1O, have chronic active BCR
signaling and are very sensitive to the Btk inhibitors described herein. The irreversible Btk
inhibitors described herein potently and irreversibly inhibit the growth of OCI-Ly1O (EC50
continuous exposure     = 10 nM, EC50 1 hour pulse     = 50 nM). In addition, induction of apoptosis,
as shown by caspase activation, Annexin-V flow cytometry and increase in sub-GO fraction is
observed in OCILy1O. Both sensitive and resistant cells express Btk at similar levels, and the
active site of Btk is fully occupied by the inhibitor in both as shown using a fluorescently
labeled affinity probe. OCI-Lyl0 cells are shown to have chronically active BCR signaling to
NF-KB which is dose dependently inhibited by the Btk inhibitors described herein. The activity
of Btk inhibitors in the cell lines studied herein are also characterized by comparing signal
transduction profiles (Btk, PLCy, ERK, NF-KB, AKT), cytokine secretion profiles and mRNA
expression profiles, both with and without BCR stimulation, and observed significant
differences in these profiles that lead to clinical biomarkers that identify the most sensitive
patient populations to Btk inhibitor treatment. See U.S. Patent No. 7,711,492 and Staudt et al.,

[00209]          Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) are
commonly thought as the same disease with slightly different manifestations. Where the
cancerous cells gather determines whether it is called CLL or SLL. When the cancer cells are
primarily found in the lymph nodes, lima bean shaped structures of the lymphatic system (a
system primarily of tiny vessels found in the body), it is called SLL. SLL accounts for about 5%
to 10% of all lymphomas. When most of the cancer cells are in the bloodstream and the bone
marrow, it is called CLL.
[00210]          Both CLL and SLL are slow-growing diseases, although CLL, which is much
more common, tends to grow slower. CLL and SLL are treated the same way. They are usually
not considered curable with standard treatments, but depending on the stage and growth rate of
the disease, most patients live longer than 10 years. Occasionally over time, these slow-growing
lymphomas may transform into a more aggressive type of lymphoma.
[00211]          Chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukemia. It is
estimated that 100,760 people in the United States are living with or are in remission from CLL.
                                                   - 71 -

Most (>75%) people newly diagnosed with CLL are over the age of 50. Currently CLL
treatment focuses on controlling the disease and its symptoms rather than on an outright cure.
CLL is treated by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biological therapy, or bone marrow
transplantation. Symptoms are sometimes treated surgically (splenectomy removal of enlarged
spleen) or by radiation therapy ("de-bulking" swollen lymph nodes). Though CLL progresses
slowly in most cases, it is considered generally incurable. Certain CLLs are classified as high
risk. As used herein, "high risk CLL" means CLL characterized by at least one of the following
1) 17p 13-; 2) 11q22-; 3) unmutated IgVH together with ZAP-70+ and/or CD38+; or 4) trisomy
12.
[00212]          CLL treatment is typically administered when the patient's clinical symptoms or
blood counts indicate that the disease has progressed to a point where it may affect the patient's
quality of life.
[00213]          Small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL) is very similar to CLL described supra, and is
also a cancer of B-cells. In SLL the abnormal lymphocytes mainly affect the lymph nodes.
However, in CLL the abnormal cells mainly affect the blood and the bone marrow. The spleen
may be affected in both conditions. SLL accounts for about lin 25 of all cases of non-Hodgkin
lymphoma. It can occur at any time from young adulthood to old age, but is rare under the age of
50. SLL is considered an indolent lymphoma. This means that the disease progresses very
slowly, and patients tend to live many years after diagnosis. However, most patients are
diagnosed with advanced disease, and although SLL responds well to a variety of chemotherapy
drugs, it is generally considered to be incurable. Although some cancers tend to occur more
often in one gender or the other, cases and deaths due to SLL are evenly split between men and
women. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 60 years.
[00214]          Although SLL is indolent, it is persistently progressive. The usual pattern of this
disease is one of high response rates to radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, with a period of
disease remission. This is followed months or years later by an inevitable relapse. Re-treatment
leads to a response again, but again the disease will relapse. This means that although the short
term prognosis of SLL is quite good, over time, many patients develop fatal complications of
recurrent disease. Considering the age of the individuals typically diagnosed with CLL and SLL,
there is a need in the art for a simple and effective treatment of the disease with minimum side
effects that do not impede on the patient's quality of life. The instant invention fulfills this long
standing need in the art.

that surrounds normal germinal center follicles. MCL cells generally over-express cyclin D1 due
to a t(1 1:14) chromosomal translocation in the DNA. More specifically, the translocation is at

t(1 1;14)(ql3;q32). Only about 5% of lymphomas are of this type. The cells are small to medium
in size. Men are affected most often. The average age of patients is in the early 60s. The
lymphoma is usually widespread when it is diagnosed, involving lymph nodes, bone marrow,
and, very often, the spleen. Mantle cell lymphoma is not a very fast growing lymphoma, but is
difficult to treat.

[00222]          The term "nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma" refers to an indolent B-cell
lymphoma that is found mostly in the lymph nodes. The disease is rare and only accounts for 1%
of all Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NHL). It is most commonly diagnosed in older patients,
with women more susceptible than men. The disease is classified as a marginal zone lymphoma
because the mutation occurs in the marginal zone of the B-cells. Due to its confinement in the
lymph nodes, this disease is also classified as nodal.

[002261          The term "Burkitt lymphoma" refers to a type of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
(NHL) that commonly affects children. It is a highly aggressive type of B-cell lymphoma that
often starts and involves body parts other than lymph nodes. In spite of its fast-growing nature,
Burkitt's lymphoma is often curable with modern intensive therapies. There are two broad types
of Burkitt's lymphoma - the sporadic and the endemic varieties:
[002271          Endemic Burkitt's lymphoma: The disease involves children much more than
adults, and is related to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection in 95% cases. It occurs primarily is
equatorial Africa, where about half of all childhood cancers are Burkitt's lymphoma. It
characteristically has a high chance of involving the jawbone, a rather distinctive feature that is
rare in sporadic Burkitt's. It also commonly involves the abdomen.
[002281          Sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma: The type of Burkitt's lymphoma that affects the
rest of the world, including Europe and the Americas is the sporadic type. Here too, it's mainly a
disease in children. The link between Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) is not as strong as with the
endemic variety, though direct evidence of EBV infection is present in one out of five patients.
More than the involvement of lymph nodes, it is the abdomen that is notably affected in more
than 90% of the children. Bone marrow involvement is more common than in the sporadic
variety.

[002301          The term "Waldenstr6m macroglobulinemia", also known as lymphoplasmacytic
lymphoma, is cancer involving a subtype of white blood cells called lymphocytes. It is
characterized by an uncontrolled clonal proliferation of terminally differentiated B lymphocytes.
It is also characterized by the lymphoma cells making an antibody called immunoglobulin M
(IgM). The IgM antibodies circulate in the blood in large amounts, and cause the liquid part of
the blood to thicken, like syrup. This can lead to decreased blood flow to many organs, which
can cause problems with vision (because of poor circulation in blood vessels in the back of the
eyes) and neurological problems (such as headache, dizziness, and confusion) caused by poor
blood flow within the brain. Other symptoms can include feeling tired and weak, and a tendency
                                                   - 80 -

to bleed easily. The underlying etiology is not fully understood but a number of risk factors have
been identified, including the locus 6p2l.3 on chromosome 6. There is a 2- to 3-fold risk
increase of developing WM in people with a personal history of autoimmune diseases with
autoantibodies and particularly elevated risks associated with hepatitis, human
immunodeficiency virus, and rickettsiosis.

[00234]          Leukemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow characterized by an abnormal
increase of blood cells, usually leukocytes (white blood cells). Leukemia is a broad term
covering a spectrum of diseases. The first division is between its acute and chronic forms: (i)
acute leukemia is characterized by the rapid increase of immature blood cells. This crowding
makes the bone marrow unable to produce healthy blood cells. Immediate treatment is required
in acute leukemia due to the rapid progression and accumulation of the malignant cells, which
then spill over into the bloodstream and spread to other organs of the body. Acute forms of
leukemia are the most common forms of leukemia in children; (ii) chronic leukemia is
distinguished by the excessive build up of relatively mature, but still abnormal, white blood
cells. Typically taking months or years to progress, the cells are produced at a much higher rate
than normal cells, resulting in many abnormal white blood cells in the blood. Chronic leukemia
mostly occurs in older people, but can theoretically occur in any age group. Additionally, the
diseases are subdivided according to which kind of blood cell is affected. This split divides
leukemias into lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemias and myeloid or myelogenous
leukemias: (i) lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemias, the cancerous change takes place in a
type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form lymphocytes, which are infection-fighting
immune system cells; (ii) myeloid or myelogenous leukemias, the cancerous change takes place
in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form red blood cells, some other types of white
cells, and platelets.
[002351          Within these main categories, there are several subcategories including, but not
limited to, Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), Chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML), and Hairy cell leukemia (HCL).
Btk inhibitors
[002361          Also presented herein are methods for treating a cancer such as by way of
example only, a BCLD, in a subject wherein the subject has been treated with a dosing of a Btk
inhibitor. In the following description of irreversible Btk compounds suitable for use in the
methods described herein, definitions of referred-to standard chemistry terms may be found in
reference works (if not otherwise defined herein), including Carey and Sundberg "Advanced
Organic Chemistry 4th Ed." Vols. A (2000) and B (2001), Plenum Press, New York. Unless
otherwise indicated, conventional methods of mass spectroscopy, NMR, HPLC, protein
chemistry, biochemistry, recombinant DNA techniques and pharmacology, within the ordinary
                                                   - 83 -

skill of the art are employed. In addition, nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for Btk (e.g.,
human Btk) are known in the art as disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,326,469. Unless specific
definitions are provided, the nomenclature employed in connection with, and the laboratory
procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal
and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those known in the art. Standard techniques
can be used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation,
and delivery, and treatment of patients.
[002371           The Btk inhibitor compounds described herein are selective for Btk and kinases
having a cysteine residue in an amino acid sequence position of the tyrosine kinase that is
homologous to the amino acid sequence position of cysteine 481 in Btk. Generally, an
irreversible inhibitor compound of Btk used in the methods described herein is identified or
characterized in an in vitro assay, e.g., an acellular biochemical assay or a cellular functional
assay. Such assays are useful to determine an in vitro IC 50 for an irreversible Btk inhibitor
compound.
[002381           For example, an acellular kinase assay can be used to determine Btk activity after
incubation of the kinase in the absence or presence of a range of concentrations of a candidate
irreversible Btk inhibitor compound. If the candidate compound is in fact an irreversible Btk
inhibitor, Btk kinase activity will not be recovered by repeat washing with inhibitor-free
medium. See, e.g., J. B. Smaill, et al. (1999), J. Med. Chem. 42(10):1803-1815. Further,
covalent complex formation between Btk and a candidate irreversible Btk inhibitor is a useful
indicator of irreversible inhibition of Btk that can be readily determined by a number of methods
known in the art (e.g., mass spectrometry). For example, some irreversible Btk-inhibitor
compounds can form a covalent bond with Cys 481 of Btk (e.g., via a Michael reaction).
[002391           Cellular functional assays for Btk inhibition include measuring one or more
cellular endpoints in response to stimulating a Btk-mediated pathway in a cell line (e.g., BCR
activation in Ramos cells) in the absence or presence of a range of concentrations of a candidate
irreversible Btk inhibitor compound. Useful endpoints for determining a response to BCR
activation include, e.g., autophosphorylation of Btk, phosphorylation of a Btk target protein
(e.g., PLC-y), and cytoplasmic calcium flux.
[00240]           High throughput assays for many acellular biochemical assays (e.g., kinase
assays) and cellular functional assays (e.g., calcium flux) are well known to those of ordinary
skill in the art. In addition, high throughput screening systems are commercially available (see,
e.g., Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, MA; Air Technical Industries, Mentor, OH; Beckman
Instruments, Inc. Fullerton, CA; Precision Systems, Inc., Natick, MA, etc.). These systems
typically automate entire procedures including all sample and reagent pipetting, liquid
                                                    - 84 -

dispensing, timed incubations, and final readings of the microplate in detector(s) appropriate for
the assay. Automated systems thereby allow the identification and characterization of a large
number of irreversible Btk compounds without undue effort.
[00241]         In some embodiments, the Btk inhibitor is selected from the group consisting of a
small organic molecule, a macromolecule, a peptide or a non-peptide.
[00242]         In some embodiments, the Btk inhibitor provided herein is a reversible or
irreversible inhibitor. In certain embodiments, the Btk inhibitor is an irreversible inhibitor.
[00243]         In some embodiments, the irreversible Btk inhibitor forms a covalent bond with a
cysteine sidechain of a Bruton's tyrosine kinase, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase homolog, or a Btk
tyrosine kinase cysteine homolog.
[00244]         Irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds can use for the manufacture of a
medicament for treating any of the foregoing conditions (e.g., autoimmune diseases,
inflammatory diseases, allergy disorders, B-cell proliferative disorders, or thromboembolic
disorders).
[002451         In some embodiments, the irreversible Btk inhibitor compound used for the
methods described herein inhibits Btk or a Btk homolog kinase activity with an in vitro IC5 0 of
less than 10 piM. (e.g., less than 1 jiM, less than 0.5 piM, less than 0.4 piM, less than 0.3 piM, less
than 0.1, less than 0.08 piM, less than 0.06 piM, less than 0.05 piM, less than 0.04 piM, less than
0.03 piM, less than less than 0.02 piM, less than 0.01, less than 0.008 piM, less than 0.006 piM,
less than 0.005 piM, less than 0.004 piM, less than 0.003 piM, less than less than 0.002 piM, less
than 0.001, less than 0.00099 piM, less than 0.00098 piM, less than 0.00097 piM, less than
0.00096 piM, less than 0.00095 piM, less than 0.00094 piM, less than 0.00093 piM, less than
0.00092, or less than 0.00090 piM).
[002461         In one embodiment, the irreversible Btk inhibitor compound selectively and
irreversibly inhibits an activated form of its target tyrosine kinase (e.g., a phosphorylated form
of the tyrosine kinase). For example, activated Btk is transphosphorylated at tyrosine 551. Thus,
in these embodiments the irreversible Btk inhibitor inhibits the target kinase in cells only once
the target kinase is activated by the signaling events.

the structure of any of Formula (A), Formula (B), Formula (C), Formula (D), Formula (E), or

[002631           In a further or alternative embodiment, the "G" group of any of Formula (Al),
Formula (B 1), or Formula (C1) is any group that is used to tailor the physical and biological
properties of the molecule. Such tailoring/modifications are achieved using groups which
modulate Michael acceptor chemical reactivity, acidity, basicity, lipophilicity, solubility and
other physical properties of the molecule. The physical and biological properties modulated by
such modifications to G include, by way of example only, enhancing chemical reactivity of
Michael acceptor group, solubility, in vivo absorption, and in vivo metabolism. In addition, in
vivo metabolism includes, by way of example only, controlling in vivo PK properties, off-target
activities, potential toxicities associated with cypP450 interactions, drug-drug interactions, and
the like. Further, modifications to G allow for the tailoring of the in vivo efficacy of the
compound through the modulation of, by way of example, specific and non-specific protein
binding to plasma proteins and lipids and tissue distribution in vivo.

Use of Protecting Groups
[002951         In the reactions described, it may be necessary to protect reactive functional
groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in
the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Protecting groups are
used to block some or all reactive moieties and prevent such groups from participating in
chemical reactions until the protective group is removed. In one embodiment, each protective
group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally
disparate reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal. Protective groups
                                                    - 108-

can be removed by acid, base, and hydrogenolysis. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal
and t-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and may be used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive
moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by
hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive
moieties may be blocked with base labile groups such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and
acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as t-butyl carbamate or
with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.
[002961          Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may also be blocked with
hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups
capable of hydrogen bonding with acids may be blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc.
Carboxylic acid reactive moieties may be protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as
exemplified herein, or they may be blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such
as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups may be blocked with fluoride labile
silyl carbamates.
[002971          Allyl blocking groups are useful in the presence of acid- and base- protecting
groups since the former are stable and can be subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid
catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid can be deprotected with a Pdo-catalyzed
reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting
groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate
may be attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked
and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react.

FurtherForms of Compounds
[003001          The compounds described herein may possess one or more stereocenters and each
center may exist in the R or S configuration. The compounds presented herein include all
diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof
Stereoisomers may be obtained, if desired, by methods known in the art as, for example, the
separation of stereoisomers by chiral chromatographic columns.
[003011          Diasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on
the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known, for example, by
chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. In one embodiment, enantiomers can be
separated by chiral chromatographic columns. In other embodiments, enantiomers can be
separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with
an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and
converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure
enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomers, enantiomers, and mixtures thereof are
considered as part of the compositions described herein.
[00302]          The methods and formulations described herein include the use of N-oxides,
crystalline forms (also known as polymorphs), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of
compounds described herein, as well as active metabolites of these compounds having the same
type of activity. In some situations, compounds may exist as tautomers. All tautomers are
included within the scope of the compounds presented herein. In addition, the compounds
described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically
acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds
presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein.
[003031          Compounds of Formula D in unoxidized form can be prepared from N-oxides of
compounds of Formula D by treating with a reducing agent, such as, but not limited to, sulfur,
sulfur dioxide, triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus
trichloride, tribromide, or the like in a suitable inert organic solvent, such as, but not limited to,
acetonitrile, ethanol, aqueous dioxane, or the like at 0 to 80'C.
[00304]          In some embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as prodrugs. A
"prodrug" refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often
useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They
may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug
may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An
                                                    -110-

example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound described herein, which is
administered as an ester (the "prodrug") to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where
water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the
carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A
further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group
where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in
vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or
therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is
enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically,
pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. To produce a prodrug, a
pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be
regenerated upon in vivo administration. The prodrug can be designed to alter the metabolic
stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the
flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. By virtue of knowledge
of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, those of skill in this art, once a
pharmaceutically active compound is known, can design prodrugs of the compound. (see, for
example, Nogrady (1985) Medicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach, Oxford University
Press, New York, pages 388-392; Silverman (1992), The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design
and Drug Action, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, pages 352-401, Saulnier et al., (1994),
Bioorganicand Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, p. 1985).
[003051          Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is
metabolized in vivo to produce a derivative as set forth herein are included within the scope of
the claims. In some cases, some of the herein-described compounds may be a prodrug for
another derivative or active compound.
[00306]          Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to
administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration
whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical
compositions over the parent drug. Prodrugs may be designed as reversible drug derivatives, for
use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. In some embodiments, the
design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. See, e.g., Fedorak et al., Am. J.
Physiol., 269:G210-218 (1995); McLoed et al., Gastroenterol,106:405-413 (1994); Hochhaus et

[003071          Sites on the aromatic ring portion of compounds of Formula D can be susceptible
to various metabolic reactions, therefore incorporation of appropriate substituents on the
aromatic ring structures, such as, by way of example only, halogens can reduce, minimize or
eliminate this metabolic pathway.
[00308]          Compounds described herein include isotopically-labeled compounds, which are
identical to those recited in the various formulas and structures presented herein, but for the fact
that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different
from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be
incorporated into the present compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, fluorine and chlorine, such as      2H, 3H, 1C, 1C, 1N,   180,  0,  5S, 18F, 3 6Cl, respectively.
Certain isotopically-labeled compounds described herein, for example those into which
radioactive isotopes such as 3H and "C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate
                                                                                             2
tissue distribution assays. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e.,     2H, can
afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example
increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements.
[00309]          In additional or further embodiments, the compounds described herein are
metabolized upon administration to an organism in need to produce a metabolite that is then
used to produce a desired effect, including a desired therapeutic effect.
[00310]          Compounds described herein may be formed as, and/or used as, pharmaceutically
acceptable salts. The type of pharmaceutical acceptable salts, include, but are not limited to: (1)
acid addition salts, formed ) by reacting the free base form of the compound with a
pharmaceutically acceptable: inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid,
sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, metaphosphoric acid, and the like; or with an organic

alkali metal ion (e.g. lithium, sodium, potassium), an alkaline earth ion (e.g. magnesium, or
calcium), or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base. Acceptable organic bases
include ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, tromethamine, N-methylglucamine, and
the like. Acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium
hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like.
[003111          The corresponding counterions of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be
analyzed and identified using various methods including, but not limited to, ion exchange
chromatography, ion chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, inductively coupled plasma,
atomic absorption spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, or any combination thereof
[00312]          The salts are recovered by using at least one of the following techniques:
filtration, precipitation with a non-solvent followed by filtration, evaporation of the solvent, or,
in the case of aqueous solutions, lyophilization.
[00313]          It should be understood that a reference to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
includes the solvent addition forms or crystal forms thereof, particularly solvates or polymorphs.
Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and may be
formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as
water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are
formed when the solvent is alcohol. Solvates of compounds described herein can be
conveniently prepared or formed during the processes described herein. In addition, the
compounds provided herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms. In general, the
solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the
compounds and methods provided herein.

stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are often formed during the
process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and
the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the
solvent is alcohol. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same
elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction
patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical
properties, stability, and solubility. Various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of
crystallization, and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate.
[003151          Compounds described herein may be in various forms, including but not limited
to, amorphous forms, milled forms and nano-particulate forms. In addition, compounds

[00390]          In certain embodiments, subpopulations of patients having a hematological
malignancy cancer or pre- that would benefit from a known treatment are identified by screening
candidate subjects for one or more clinically useful biomarkers known in the art. Any clinically
useful prognostic marker known to those of skill in the art can be used. In some embodiments,
the subpopulation includes patients having chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and the
clinically useful prognostic markers of particular interest include, but are not limited to, ZAP-70,
                                                   - 133 -

CD38,.beta.2 microglobulin, and cytogenetic markers, for example, p53 mutational status, ATM
mutational status, chromosome deletions, such as the chromosome 17p deletion and the
chromosome 11 q deletion, all of which are clinically useful prognostic markers for this disease.
[003911          ZAP-70 is a tyrosine kinase that associates with the zeta subunit of the T cell
antigen receptor (TCR) and plays a pivotal role in T cell activation and development (Chan et al.
(1992) Cell 71:649-662). ZAP-70 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and is essential in
mediating signal transduction following TCR stimulation. Overexpression or constitutive
activation of tyrosine kinases has been demonstrated to be involved in a number of malignancies
including leukemias and several types of solid tumors. For example, increased ZAP-70 RNA
expression levels are a prognostic marker of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (Rosenwald
et al. (2001) J. Exp. Med. 194:1639-1647). ZAP-70 is expressed in T-cells and natural killer
cells, but is not known to be expressed in normal B-cells. However, ZAP-70 is expressed at high
levels in the B-cells of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL)
patients, and more particularly in the subset of CLL patients who tend to have the more
aggressive clinical course that is found in CLL/SLL patients with unmutated Ig genes (Wiestner
et al. (2003) Blood 101: 4944-495 1; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20030203416).
Because of the correlation between ZAP-70 expression levels and Ig gene mutation status, ZAP
70 can be used as a prognostic indicator to identify those patients likely to have severe disease
(high ZAP-70, unmutated Ig genes), and who are therefore candidates for aggressive therapy.
[00392]          CD38 is a signal transduction molecule as well as an ectoenzyme catalyzing the
synthesis and degradation of cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR). CD38 expression is present at high
levels in bone marrow precursor B cells, is down-regulated in resting normal B cells, and then is
re-expressed in terminally differentiated plasma cells (Campana et al. (2000) Chem. Immunol.
75:169-188). CD38 is a reliable prognostic indicator in B-CLL, with the expression of CD38
generally indicating a less favorable outcome (D'Arena et al. (2001) Leuk. Lymphoma 42:109;
Del Poeta et al. (2001) Blood 98:2633; Durig et al. (2002) Leukemia 16:30; Ibrahim et al. (2001)
Blood 98:181; Deaglio et al. (2003) Blood 102:2146-2155). The unfavorable clinical indications
that CD38 expression has been associated with include an advanced stage of disease, poor
responsiveness to chemotherapy, a shorter time before initial treatment is required, and a shorter
survival time (Deaglio et al. (2003) Blood 102:2146-2155). Initially, a strong correlation
between CD38 expression and IgV gene mutation was observed, with patients having unmutated
V genes displaying higher percentages of CD38.sup.+ B-CLL cells than those with mutated V
genes (Damle et al. (1999) Blood 94:1840-1847). However, subsequent studies have indicated
that CD38 expression does not always correlate with the rearrangement of the IgV genes
(Hamblin et al. (2002) Blood 99:1023; Thunberg et al. (2001) Blood 97:1892).

[003931          p53 is a nuclear phosphoprotein that acts as a tumor suppressor. Wild-type p53 is
involved in regulating cell growth and division. p53 binds to DNA, stimulating the production of
a protein (p21) that interacts with a cell division-stimulating protein (cdk2). When p21 is bound
to cdk2, the cell is blocked from entering the next stage of cell division. Mutant p53 is incapable
of binding DNA effectively, thus preventing p21 from acting as the stop signal for cell division,
resulting in uncontrolled cell division, and tumor formation. p53 also regulates the induction of
programmed cell death (apoptosis) in response to DNA damage, cell stress or the aberrant
expression of some oncogenes. Expression of wild type p53 in some cancer cell lines has been
shown to restore growth suppression control (Casey et al. (1991) Oncogene 6:1791-1797;
Takahashi et al. (1992) Cancer Res. 52:734-736). Mutations in p53 are found in most tumor
types, including tumors of the colon, breast, lung, ovary, bladder, and many other organs. p53
mutations have been found to be associated with Burkitt's lymphoma, L3-type B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Gaidano et al. (1991) Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88:5413-5417). p53 abnormalities have also been found associated with B-cell
prolymphocytic leukemia (Lens et al. (1997) Blood 89:2015-2023). The gene for p53 is located
on the short arm of chromosome 17 at 17pl3.105-pl2.
[00394]          B-2-microglobulin is an extracellular protein that is noncovalently associated
with the.alpha. chain of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC). It is detectable in
the serum, and is an adverse prognostic indicator in CLL (Keating et al. (1998) Blood 86:606a)
and Hodgkin's lymphoma (Chronowski et al. (2002) Cancer 95:2534-2538). It is clinically used
for lymphoproliferative diseases including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma, where
serum P-2-microglobulin levels are related to tumor cell load, prognosis, and disease activity
(Bataille et al. (1983) Br. J. Haematol. 55:439-447; Aviles et al. (1992) Rev. Invest. Clin.
44:215-220). P2 microglobulin is also useful in staging myeloma patients (Pasqualetti et al.
(1991) Eur. J. Cancer 27:1123-1126).
[003951          Cytogenetic aberrations may also be used as markers to create a predictive profile
of a hematological malignancy. For example, chromosome abnormalities are found in a large
percentage of CLL patients and are helpful in predicting the course of CLL. For example, a 17p
deletion is indicative of aggressive disease progression. In addition, CLL patients with a
chromosome 17p deletion or mutation in p53, or both, are known to respond poorly to
chemotherapeutics and rituximab. Allelic loss on chromosome 17p may be also be a useful
prognostic marker in colorectal cancer, where patients with a 17p deletion are associated with an
increased tendency of disease dissemination in colorectal cancer (Khine et al. (1994) Cancer
73:28-35).
                                                   - 135 -

[003961          Deletions of the long arm of chromosome 11 (11 q) are one of the most frequent
structural chromosome aberrations in various types of lymphoproliferative disorders. CLL
patients with chromosome 11 q deletion and possibly ATM mutations have a poor survival
compared to patients without either this defect or the 17p deletion. Furthermore, an 11 q deletion
is often accompanied by extensive lymph node involvement (Dohner et al. (1997) Blood
89:2516-2522). This deletion also identifies patients who are at high risk for disease persistence
after high-dose therapy and autologous transplantation.
[003971          The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATA4) gene is a tumor suppressor gene that is
involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and repair of DNA double-strand breaks. It is found on
chromosome 11. ATM mutations are associated with increased risk for breast cancer among
women with a family history of breast cancer (Chenevix-Trench et al. (2002) J. Natl. Cancer
Inst. 94:205-215; Thorstenson et al. (2003) CancerRes. 63:3325-3333) and/or early-onset breast
cancers (Izatt et al. (1999) Genes Chromosomes Cancer 26:286-294; Teraoka et al. (2001)
Cancer 92:479-487). There is also a high frequency of association of rhabdomyosarcoma with
ATM gene mutation/deletion (Zhang et al. (2003) CancerBiol. Ther. 1:87-91).
[00398]          Methods for detecting chromosomal abnormalities in a patient are well known in
the art (see, for example, Cuneo et al. (1999) Blood 93:1372-1380; Dohner et al. (1997) Blood
89:2516-2522). Methods to measure mutated proteins, such as ATM, are well known in the art
(see, for example, Butch et al. (2004) Clin. Chem. 50: 2302-2308).
[00399]          Thus, the biomarkers that are evaluated in the methods described herein include
the cell survival and apoptotic proteins described supra, and proteins involved in hematological
malignancy-related signaling pathways. Determining the expression or presence can be at the
protein or nucleic acid level. Thus, the biomarkers include these proteins and the genes encoding
these proteins. Where detection is at the protein level, the biomarker protein comprises the full
length polypeptide or any detectable fragment thereof, and can include variants of these protein
sequences. Similarly, where detection is at the nucleotide level, the biomarker nucleic acid
includes DNA comprising the full-length coding sequence, a fragment of the full-length coding
sequence, variants of these sequences, for example naturally occurring variants or splice
variants, or the complement of such a sequence. Biomarker nucleic acids also include RNA, for
example, mRNA, comprising the full-length sequence encoding the biomarker protein of
interest, a fragment of the full-length RNA sequence of interest, or variants of these sequences.
Biomarker proteins and biomarker nucleic acids also include variants of these sequences. By
"fragment" is intended a portion of the polynucleotide or a portion of the amino acid sequence
and hence protein encoded thereby. Polynucleotides that are fragments of a biomarker
nucleotide sequence generally comprise at least 10, 15, 20, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350,

nucleotides, or up to the number of nucleotides present in a full-length biomarker polynucleotide
disclosed herein. A fragment of a biomarker polynucleotide will generally encode at least 15, 25,
30, 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250 contiguous amino acids, or up to the total number of amino acids
present in a full-length biomarker protein of the invention. "Variant" is intended to mean
substantially similar sequences. Generally, variants of a particular biomarker of the invention
will have at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 7 0%, 7 5%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%,
92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity to that biomarker as
determined by sequence alignment programs known in the art.
[00400]          As provided above, any method known in the art can be used in the methods for
determining the expression or presence of biomarker described herein. Circulating levels of
biomarkers in a blood sample obtained from a candidate subject, can be measured, for example,
by ELISA, radioimmunoassay (RIA), electrochemiluminescence (ECL), Western blot,
multiplexing technologies, or other similar methods. Cell surface expression of biomarkers can
be measured, for example, by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, Western Blot,
immunoprecipitation, magnetic bead selection, and quantification of cells expressing either of
these cell surface markers. Biomarker RNA expression levels could be measured by RT-PCR,
Qt-PCR, microarray, Northern blot, or other similar technologies.
[00401]          As previously noted, determining the expression or presence of the biomarker of
interest at the protein or nucleotide level can be accomplished using any detection method
known to those of skill in the art. By "detecting expression" or "detecting the level of' is
intended determining the expression level or presence of a biomarker protein or gene in the
biological sample. Thus, "detecting expression" encompasses instances where a biomarker is
determined not to be expressed, not to be detectably expressed, expressed at a low level,
expressed at a normal level, or overexpressed.

of lymphocytes are isolated, detected or measured. In certain embodiments, the one or more
subpopulation of lymphocytes are isolated, detected or measured using immunophenotyping
techniques. In other embodiments, the one or more subpopulation of lymphocytes are isolated,

[004041         In certain aspects, the methods described herein, the determining step requires
determining the expression or presence of a combination of biomarkers. In certain embodiment,
the combination of biomarkers is CD19 and CD5 or CD20 and CD5.
[004051         In certain aspects, the expression or presence of these various biomarkers and any
clinically useful prognostic markers in a biological sample can be detected at the protein or
nucleic acid level, using, for example, immunohistochemistry techniques or nucleic acid-based
techniques such as in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. In one embodiments, the expression or
presence of one or more biomarkers is carried out by a means for nucleic acid amplification, a
means for nucleic acid sequencing, a means utilizing a nucleic acid microarray (DNA and
RNA), or a means for in situ hybridization using specifically labeled probes.
[00406]         In other embodiments, the determining the expression or presence of one or more
biomarkers is carried out through gel electrophoresis. In one embodiment, the determination is
carried out through transfer to a membrane and hybridization with a specific probe.
[004071         In other embodiments, the determining the expression or presence of one or more
biomarkers carried out by a diagnostic imaging technique.
[00408]         In still other embodiments, the determining the expression or presence of one or
more biomarkers carried out by a detectable solid substrate. In one embodiment, the detectable
solid substrate is paramagnetic nanoparticles functionalized with antibodies.
[00409]         In another aspect, provided herein are methods for detecting or measuring
residual lymphoma following a course of treatment in order to guide continuing or discontinuing
treatment or changing from one therapeutic to another comprising determining the expression or
presence of one or more biomarkers from one or more subpopulation of lymphocytes in a
subject wherein the course of treatment is treatment with a Btk inhibitor.
[00410]         Methods for detecting expression of the biomarkers described herein, and
optionally cytokine markers, within the test and control biological samples comprise any
methods that determine the quantity or the presence of these markers either at the nucleic acid or
protein level. Such methods are well known in the art and include but are not limited to western
blots, northern blots, ELISA, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry,
immunohistochemistry, nucleic acid hybridization techniques, nucleic acid reverse transcription
methods, and nucleic acid amplification methods. In particular embodiments, expression of a
biomarker is detected on a protein level using, for example, antibodies that are directed against
specific biomarker proteins. These antibodies can be used in various methods such as Western
blot, ELISA, multiplexing technologies, immunoprecipitation, or immunohistochemistry
techniques. In some embodiments, detection of cytokine markers is accomplished by
electrochemiluminescence (ECL).
                                                  - 138 -

[004111           Any means for specifically identifying and quantifying a biomarker (for example,
biomarker, a biomarker of cell survival or proliferation, a biomarker of apoptosis, a biomarker of
a Btk-mediated signaling pathway) in the biological sample of a candidate subject is
contemplated. Thus, in some embodiments, expression level of a biomarker protein of interest in
a biological sample is detected by means of a binding protein capable of interacting specifically
with that biomarker protein or a biologically active variant thereof Preferably, labeled
antibodies, binding portions thereof, or other binding partners may be used. The word "label"
when used herein refers to a detectable compound or composition that is conjugated directly or
indirectly to the antibody so as to generate a "labeled" antibody. The label may be detectable by
itself (e.g., radioisotope labels or fluorescent labels) or, in the case of an enzymatic label, may
catalyze chemical alteration of a substrate compound or composition that is detectable.
[00412]           The antibodies for detection of a biomarker protein may be monoclonal or
polyclonal in origin, or may be synthetically or recombinantly produced. The amount of
complexed protein, for example, the amount of biomarker protein associated with the binding
protein, for example, an antibody that specifically binds to the biomarker protein, is determined
using standard protein detection methodologies known to those of skill in the art. A detailed
review of immunological assay design, theory and protocols can be found in numerous texts in
the art (see, for example, Ausubel et al., eds. (1995) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology)
(Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, NY)); Coligan et al., eds. (1994) Current Protocols
in Immunology (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y.).
[00413]           The choice of marker used to label the antibodies will vary depending upon the
application. However, the choice of the marker is readily determinable to one skilled in the art.
These labeled antibodies may be used in immunoassays as well as in histological applications to
detect the presence of any biomarker or protein of interest. The labeled antibodies may be
polyclonal or monoclonal. Further, the antibodies for use in detecting a protein of interest may
be labeled with a radioactive atom, an enzyme, a chromophoric or fluorescent moiety, or a
colorimetric tag as described elsewhere herein. The choice of tagging label also will depend on
the detection limitations desired. Enzyme assays (ELISAs) typically allow detection of a colored
product formed by interaction of the enzyme-tagged complex with an enzyme substrate.
Radionuclides that can serve as detectable labels include, for example, 1-13 1, 1-123, 1-125, Y-90,
Re-188, Re-186, At-21 1, Cu-67, Bi-212, and Pd-109. Examples of enzymes that can serve as
detectable labels include, but are not limited to, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase,
beta-galactosidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Chromophoric moieties include,
but are not limited to, fluorescein and rhodamine. The antibodies may be conjugated to these
labels by methods known in the art. For example, enzymes and chromophoric molecules may be
                                                    - 139 -

conjugated to the antibodies by means of coupling agents, such as dialdehydes, carbodiimides,
dimaleimides, and the like. Alternatively, conjugation may occur through a ligand-receptor pair.
Examples of suitable ligand-receptor pairs are biotin-avidin or biotin-streptavidin, and antibody
antigen.
[00414]          In certain embodiments, expression or presence of one or more biomarkers or
other proteins of interest within a biological sample, for example, a sample of bodily fluid, is
determined by radioimmunoassays or enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs), competitive
binding enzyme-linked immunoassays, dot blot (see, for example, Promega Protocols and
Applications Guide (2 nd ed.; Promega Corporation (1991), Western blot (see, for example,
Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Vol. 3, Chapter 18 (Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, N.Y.), chromatography, preferably high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), or other assays known in the art. Thus, the
detection assays can involve steps such as, but not limited to, immunoblotting,
immuno diffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, or immunoprecipitation.
[004151          In certain other embodiments, the methods of the invention are useful for
identifying and treating hematological malignancies, including those listed above, that are
refractory to (i.e., resistant to, or have become resistant to) first-line oncotherapeutic treatments.
[00416]          The expression or presence of one or more of the biomarkers described herein
may also be determined at the nucleic acid level. Nucleic acid-based techniques for assessing
expression are well known in the art and include, for example, determining the level of
biomarker mRNA in a biological sample. Many expression detection methods use isolated RNA.
Any RNA isolation technique that does not select against the isolation of mRNA can be utilized
for the purification of RNA (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., ed. (1987-1999) Current Protocols in
Molecular Biology (John Wiley & Sons, New York). Additionally, large numbers of tissue
samples can readily be processed using techniques well known to those of skill in the art, such
as, for example, the single-step RNA isolation process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,843,155.
[004171          Thus, in some embodiments, the detection of a biomarker or other protein of
interest is assayed at the nucleic acid level using nucleic acid probes. The term "nucleic acid
probe" refers to any molecule that is capable of selectively binding to a specifically intended
target nucleic acid molecule, for example, a nucleotide transcript. Probes can be synthesized by
one of skill in the art, or derived from appropriate biological preparations. Probes may be
specifically designed to be labeled, for example, with a radioactive label, a fluorescent label, an
enzyme, a chemiluminescent tag, a colorimetric tag, or other labels or tags that are discussed
above or that are known in the art. Examples of molecules that can be utilized as probes include,
but are not limited to, RNA and DNA.
                                                   - 140 -

[004181          For example, isolated mRNA can be used in hybridization or amplification assays
that include, but are not limited to, Southern or Northern analyses, polymerase chain reaction
analyses and probe arrays. One method for the detection of mRNA levels involves contacting
the isolated mRNA with a nucleic acid molecule (probe) that can hybridize to the mRNA
encoded by the gene being detected. The nucleic acid probe can be, for example, a full-length
cDNA, or a portion thereof, such as an oligonucleotide of at least 7, 15, 30, 50, 100, 250 or 500
nucleotides in length and sufficient to specifically hybridize under stringent conditions to an
mRNA or genomic DNA encoding a biomarker, biomarker described herein above.
Hybridization of an mRNA with the probe indicates that the biomarker or other target protein of
interest is being expressed.
[00419]          In one embodiment, the mRNA is immobilized on a solid surface and contacted
with a probe, for example by running the isolated mRNA on an agarose gel and transferring the
mRNA from the gel to a membrane, such as nitrocellulose. In an alternative embodiment, the
probe(s) are immobilized on a solid surface and the mRNA is contacted with the probe(s), for
example, in a gene chip array. A skilled artisan can readily adapt known mRNA detection
methods for use in detecting the level of mRNA encoding the biomarkers or other proteins of
interest.
[00420]          An alternative method for determining the level of a mRNA of interest in a
sample involves the process of nucleic acid amplification, e.g., by RT-PCR (see, for example,
U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202), ligase chain reaction (Barany (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
88:189-193), self-sustained sequence replication (Guatelli et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
USA 87:1874-1878), transcriptional amplification system (Kwoh et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. A cad.
Sci. USA 86:1173-1177), Q-Beta Replicase (Lizardi et al. (1988) Bio/Technology 6:1197),
rolling circle replication (U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,033) or any other nucleic acid amplification
method, followed by the detection of the amplified molecules using techniques well known to
those of skill in the art. These detection schemes are especially useful for the detection of
nucleic acid molecules if such molecules are present in very low numbers. In particular aspects
of the invention, biomarker expression is assessed by quantitative fluorogenic RT-PCR (i.e., the
TaqMan@ System).
[00421]          Expression levels of an RNA of interest may be monitored using a membrane
blot (such as used in hybridization analysis such as Northern, dot, and the like), or microwells,
sample tubes, gels, beads or fibers (or any solid support comprising bound nucleic acids). See
U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,770,722, 5,874,219, 5,744,305, 5,677,195 and 5,445,934, which are
incorporated herein by reference. The detection of expression may also comprise using nucleic
acid probes in solution.
                                                  - 141 -

[004221         In one embodiment of the invention, microarrays are used to determine
expression or presence of one or more biomarkers. Microarrays are particularly well suited for
this purpose because of the reproducibility between different experiments. DNA microarrays
provide one method for the simultaneous measurement of the expression levels of large numbers
of genes. Each array consists of a reproducible pattern of capture probes attached to a solid
support. Labeled RNA or DNA is hybridized to complementary probes on the array and then
detected by laser scanning. Hybridization intensities for each probe on the array are determined
and converted to a quantitative value representing relative gene expression levels. See, U.S. Pat.
Nos. 6,040,138, 5,800,992 and 6,020,135, 6,033,860, and 6,344,316, which are incorporated
herein by reference. High-density oligonucleotide arrays are particularly useful for determining
the gene expression profile for a large number of RNA's in a sample.
[00423]         Techniques for the synthesis of these arrays using mechanical synthesis methods
are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,261, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Although a planar array surface is preferred, the array may be fabricated on a surface of virtually
any shape or even a multiplicity of surfaces. Arrays may be peptides or nucleic acids on beads,
gels, polymeric surfaces, fibers such as fiber optics, glass or any other appropriate substrate, see
U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,770,358, 5,789,162, 5,708,153, 6,040,193 and 5,800,992, each of which is
hereby incorporated in its entirety for all purposes. Arrays may be packaged in such a manner as
to allow for diagnostics or other manipulation of an all-inclusive device. See, for example, U.S.
Pat. Nos. 5,856,174 and 5,922,591, herein incorporated by reference.
Pharmaceutical Compositions/Formulations
[00424]         Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a conventional manner using
one or more physiologically acceptable carriers including excipients and auxiliaries which
facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used
pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. Any
of the well-known techniques, carriers, and excipients may be used as suitable and as understood
in the art. A summary of pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be found, for

and non-fixed combinations of the active ingredients. The term "fixed combination" means that
the active ingredients, e.g. a compound described herein and a co-agent, are both administered to
a patient simultaneously in the form of a single entity or dosage. The term "non-fixed
combination" means that the active ingredients, e.g. a compound described herein and a co
agent, are administered to a patient as separate entities either simultaneously, concurrently or
sequentially with no specific intervening time limits, wherein such administration provides
effective levels of the two compounds in the body of the patient. The latter also applies to
cocktail therapy, e.g. the administration of three or more active ingredients.
[00429]         The pharmaceutical formulations described herein can be administered to a
subject by multiple administration routes, including but not limited to, oral, parenteral (e.g.,

coagulation of aqueous dispersions, bubbles in the finished film, or generally impair processing.
Exemplary anti-foaming agents include silicon emulsions or sorbitan sesquoleate.
[00432]         "Antioxidants" include, for example, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), sodium
ascorbate, ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite and tocopherol. In certain embodiments,
antioxidants enhance chemical stability where required.

they can provide a more stable environment. Salts dissolved in buffered solutions (which also
can provide pH control or maintenance) are utilized as diluents in the art, including, but not
limited to a phosphate buffered saline solution. In certain embodiments, diluents increase bulk of

[004701         Binders impart cohesiveness to solid oral dosage form formulations: for powder
filled capsule formulation, they aid in plug formation that can be filled into soft or hard shell
capsules and for tablet formulation, they ensure the tablet remaining intact after compression
and help assure blend uniformity prior to a compression or fill step. Materials suitable for use as
binders in the solid dosage forms described herein include, but are not limited to,

[004711          In general, binder levels of 20-70% are used in powder-filled gelatin capsule
formulations. Binder usage level in tablet formulations varies whether direct compression, wet
granulation, roller compaction, or usage of other excipients such as fillers which itself can act as
moderate binder. Formulators skilled in art can determine the binder level for the formulations,
but binder usage level of up to 70% in tablet formulations is common.

any of Formula D or the second agent, from the formulation. In other embodiments, the film
coating aids in patient compliance (e.g., Opadry* coatings or sugar coating). Film coatings
including Opadry* typically range from about 1% to about 3% of the tablet weight. In other
embodiments, the compressed tablets include one or more excipients.
[00482]          A capsule may be prepared, for example, by placing the bulk blend of the
formulation of the compound of any of Formula D or the second agent, described above, inside
of a capsule. In some embodiments, the formulations (non-aqueous suspensions and solutions)
are placed in a soft gelatin capsule. In other embodiments, the formulations are placed in
                                                     - 155-

standard gelatin capsules or non-gelatin capsules such as capsules comprising HPMC. In other
embodiments, the formulation is placed in a sprinkle capsule, wherein the capsule may be
swallowed whole or the capsule may be opened and the contents sprinkled on food prior to
eating. In some embodiments, the therapeutic dose is split into multiple (e.g., two, three, or four)
capsules. In some embodiments, the entire dose of the formulation is delivered in a capsule
form.
[00483]          In various embodiments, the particles of the compound of any of Formula D or
the second agent, and one or more excipients are dry blended and compressed into a mass, such
as a tablet, having a hardness sufficient to provide a pharmaceutical composition that
substantially disintegrates within less than about 30 minutes, less than about 35 minutes, less
than about 40 minutes, less than about 45 minutes, less than about 50 minutes, less than about 55
minutes, or less than about 60 minutes, after oral administration, thereby releasing the
formulation into the gastrointestinal fluid.
[00484]          In another aspect, dosage forms may include microencapsulated formulations. In
some embodiments, one or more other compatible materials are present in the
microencapsulation material. Exemplary materials include, but are not limited to, pH modifiers,
erosion facilitators, anti-foaming agents, antioxidants, flavoring agents, and carrier materials
such as binders, suspending agents, disintegration agents, filling agents, surfactants, solubilizers,
stabilizers, lubricants, wetting agents, and diluents.
[004851          Materials useful for the microencapsulation described herein include materials
compatible with compounds of any of Formula D or the second agent, which sufficiently isolate
the compound of any of Formula D or the second agent, from other non-compatible excipients.
Materials compatible with compounds of any of Formula D or the second agent, are those that
delay the release of the compounds of any of Formula D or the second agent, in vivo.
[00486]          Exemplary microencapsulation materials useful for delaying the release of the
formulations including compounds described herein, include, but are not limited to,
hydroxypropyl cellulose ethers (HPC) such as Klucel* or Nisso HPC, low-substituted
hydroxypropyl cellulose ethers (L-HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose ethers (HPMC) such

cellulose acetate phthalate, sepifilms such as mixtures of HPMC and stearic acid, cyclodextrins,
and mixtures of these materials.
[00487]         In still other embodiments, plasticizers such as polyethylene glycols, e.g., PEG
300, PEG 400, PEG 600, PEG 1450, PEG 3350, and PEG 800, stearic acid, propylene glycol,
oleic acid, and triacetin are incorporated into the microencapsulation material. In other
embodiments, the microencapsulating material useful for delaying the release of the
pharmaceutical compositions is from the USP or the National Formulary (NF). In yet other
embodiments, the microencapsulation material is Klucel. In still other embodiments, the
microencapsulation material is methocel.
[00488]         Microencapsulated compounds of any of Formula D or the second agent, may be
formulated by methods known by one of ordinary skill in the art. Such known methods include,
e.g., spray drying processes, spinning disk-solvent processes, hot melt processes, spray chilling
methods, fluidized bed, electrostatic deposition, centrifugal extrusion, rotational suspension
separation, polymerization at liquid-gas or solid-gas interface, pressure extrusion, or spraying
solvent extraction bath. In addition to these, several chemical techniques, e.g., complex
coacervation, solvent evaporation, polymer-polymer incompatibility, interfacial polymerization
in liquid media, in situ polymerization, in-liquid drying, and desolvation in liquid media could
also be used. Furthermore, other methods such as roller compaction, extrusion/spheronization,
coacervation, or nanoparticle coating may also be used.
[00489]         In one embodiment, the particles of compounds of any of Formula D or the
second agent, are microencapsulated prior to being formulated into one of the above forms. In
still another embodiment, some or most of the particles are coated prior to being further
formulated by using standard coating procedures, such as those described in Remington 's
PharmaceuticalSciences, 20th Edition (2000).
[00490]         In other embodiments, the solid dosage formulations of the compounds of any of
Formula D or the second agent, are plasticized (coated) with one or more layers. Illustratively, a
plasticizer is generally a high boiling point solid or liquid. Suitable plasticizers can be added
from about 0.01% to about 50% by weight (w/w) of the coating composition. Plasticizers
include, but are not limited to, diethyl phthalate, citrate esters, polyethylene glycol, glycerol,
acetylated glycerides, triacetin, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, triethyl citrate,
dibutyl sebacate, stearic acid, stearol, stearate, and castor oil.
                                                    - 157 -

[004911          In other embodiments, a powder including the formulations with a compound of
any of Formula D or the second agent, described herein, may be formulated to include one or
more pharmaceutical excipients and flavors. Such a powder may be prepared, for example, by
mixing the formulation and optional pharmaceutical excipients to form a bulk blend
composition. Additional embodiments also include a suspending agent and/or a wetting agent.
This bulk blend is uniformly subdivided into unit dosage packaging or multi-dosage packaging
units.
[00492]          In still other embodiments, effervescent powders are also prepared in accordance
with the present disclosure. Effervescent salts have been used to disperse medicines in water for
oral administration. Effervescent salts are granules or coarse powders containing a medicinal
agent in a dry mixture, usually composed of sodium bicarbonate, citric acid and/or tartaric acid.
When salts of the compositions described herein are added to water, the acids and the base react
to liberate carbon dioxide gas, thereby causing "effervescence." Examples of effervescent salts
include, e.g., the following ingredients: sodium bicarbonate or a mixture of sodium bicarbonate
and sodium carbonate, citric acid and/or tartaric acid. Any acid-base combination that results in
the liberation of carbon dioxide can be used in place of the combination of sodium bicarbonate
and citric and tartaric acids, as long as the ingredients were suitable for pharmaceutical use and
result in a pH of about 6.0 or higher.
[00493]          In some embodiments, the solid dosage forms described herein can be formulated
as enteric coated delayed release oral dosage forms, i.e., as an oral dosage form of a
pharmaceutical composition as described herein which utilizes an enteric coating to affect
release in the small intestine of the gastrointestinal tract. The enteric coated dosage form may be
a compressed or molded or extruded tablet/mold (coated or uncoated) containing granules,
powder, pellets, beads or particles of the active ingredient and/or other composition components,
which are themselves coated or uncoated. The enteric coated oral dosage form may also be a
capsule (coated or uncoated) containing pellets, beads or granules of the solid carrier or the
composition, which are themselves coated or uncoated.
[00494]          The term "delayed release" as used herein refers to the delivery so that the release
can be accomplished at some generally predictable location in the intestinal tract more distal to
that which would have been accomplished if there had been no delayed release alterations. In
some embodiments the method for delay of release is coating. Any coatings should be applied to
a sufficient thickness such that the entire coating does not dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids
at pH below about 5, but does dissolve at pH about 5 and above. It is expected that any anionic
polymer exhibiting a pH-dependent solubility profile can be used as an enteric coating in the
methods and compositions described herein to achieve delivery to the lower gastrointestinal
                                                    - 158 -

tract. In some embodiments the polymers described herein are anionic carboxylic polymers. In
other embodiments, the polymers and compatible mixtures thereof, and some of their properties,
include, but are not limited to:
[004951          Shellac, also called purified lac, a refined product obtained from the resinous
secretion of an insect. This coating dissolves in media of pH >7;
[00496]         Acrylic polymers. The performance of acrylic polymers (primarily their solubility
in biological fluids) can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Examples of suitable
acrylic polymers include methacrylic acid copolymers and ammonium methacrylate copolymers.
The Eudragit series E, L, S, RL, RS and NE (Rohm Pharma) are available as solubilized in
organic solvent, aqueous dispersion, or dry powders. The Eudragit series RL, NE, and RS are
insoluble in the gastrointestinal tract but are permeable and are used primarily for colonic
targeting. The Eudragit series E dissolve in the stomach. The Eudragit series L, L-30D and S are
insoluble in stomach and dissolve in the intestine;
[004971         Cellulose Derivatives. Examples of suitable cellulose derivatives are: ethyl
cellulose; reaction mixtures of partial acetate esters of cellulose with phthalic anhydride. The
performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Cellulose acetate phthalate
(CAP) dissolves in pH >6. Aquateric (FMC) is an aqueous based system and is a spray dried
CAP psuedolatex with particles <1 tm. Other components in Aquateric can include pluronics,
Tweens, and acetylated monoglycerides. Other suitable cellulose derivatives include: cellulose
acetate trimellitate (Eastman); methylcellulose (Pharmacoat, Methocel); hydroxypropylmethyl
cellulose phthalate (HPMCP); hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose succinate (HPMCS); and
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (e.g., AQOAT (Shin Etsu)). The performance
can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. For example, HPMCP such as, HP-50,
HP-55, HP-55S, HP-55F grades are suitable. The performance can vary based on the degree and
type of substitution. For example, suitable grades of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate
succinate include, but are not limited to, AS-LG (LF), which dissolves at pH 5, AS-MG (MF),
which dissolves at pH 5.5, and AS-HG (HF), which dissolves at higher pH. These polymers are
offered as granules, or as fine powders for aqueous dispersions; Poly Vinyl Acetate Phthalate
(PVAP). PVAP dissolves in pH >5, and it is much less permeable to water vapor and gastric
fluids.
[00498]         In some embodiments, the coating can, and usually does, contain a plasticizer and
possibly other coating excipients such as colorants, talc, and/or magnesium stearate, which are
well known in the art. Suitable plasticizers include triethyl citrate (Citroflex 2), triacetin
(glyceryl triacetate), acetyl triethyl citrate (Citroflec A2), Carbowax 400 (polyethylene glycol
400), diethyl phthalate, tributyl citrate, acetylated monoglycerides, glycerol, fatty acid esters,
                                                     - 159 -

propylene glycol, and dibutyl phthalate. In particular, anionic carboxylic acrylic polymers
usually will contain 10-25% by weight of a plasticizer, especially dibutyl phthalate,
polyethylene glycol, triethyl citrate and triacetin. Conventional coating techniques such as spray
or pan coating are employed to apply coatings. The coating thickness must be sufficient to
ensure that the oral dosage form remains intact until the desired site of topical delivery in the
intestinal tract is reached.
[00499]          Colorants, detackifiers, surfactants, antifoaming agents, lubricants (e.g., carnuba
wax or PEG) may be added to the coatings besides plasticizers to solubilize or disperse the
coating material, and to improve coating performance and the coated product.
[005001          In other embodiments, the formulations described herein, which include
compounds of Formula D or the second agent, are delivered using a pulsatile dosage form. A
pulsatile dosage form is capable of providing one or more immediate release pulses at
predetermined time points after a controlled lag time or at specific sites. Many other types of
controlled release systems known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are suitable for use
with the formulations described herein. Examples of such delivery systems include, e.g.,
polymer-based systems, such as polylactic and polyglycolic acid, plyanhydrides and
polycaprolactone; porous matrices, nonpolymer-based systems that are lipids, including sterols,
such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and fatty acids, or neutral fats, such as mono-, di- and
triglycerides; hydrogel release systems; silastic systems; peptide-based systems; wax coatings,
bioerodible dosage forms, compressed tablets using conventional binders and the like. See, e.g.,

particles of the compounds of any of Formula D or the second agent, described herein and at
least one dispersing agent or suspending agent for oral administration to a subject. The
formulations may be a powder and/or granules for suspension, and upon admixture with water, a
substantially uniform suspension is obtained.

suspensions selected from the group including, but not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable
aqueous oral dispersions, emulsions, solutions, elixirs, gels, and syrups. See, e.g., Singh et al.,
Encyclopedia of PharmaceuticalTechnology,         2 nd Ed., pp. 754-757 (2002). In addition to the
particles of compounds of Formula (Al-A6), the liquid dosage forms may include additives,

homogenous state, as defined in The USP Pharmacists' Pharmacopeia (2005 edition, chapter
905), for at least 4 hours. The homogeneity should be determined by a sampling method
consistent with regard to determining homogeneity of the entire composition. In one
embodiment, an aqueous suspension can be re-suspended into a homogenous suspension by
physical agitation lasting less than 1 minute. In another embodiment, an aqueous suspension can
be re-suspended into a homogenous suspension by physical agitation lasting less than 45
seconds. In yet another embodiment, an aqueous suspension can be re-suspended into a
homogenous suspension by physical agitation lasting less than 30 seconds. In still another
embodiment, no agitation is necessary to maintain a homogeneous aqueous dispersion.

dispersions include, but are not limited to, a starch, e.g., a natural starch such as corn starch or
potato starch, a pregelatinized starch such as National 1551 or Amijel*, or sodium starch
glycolate such as Promogel* or Explotab*; a cellulose such as a wood product, methylcrystalline

fatty acid esters of sorbitan, or mixtures of these substances, and the like.
[005111          In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulations described herein can be
self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS). Emulsions are dispersions of one immiscible
phase in another, usually in the form of droplets. Generally, emulsions are created by vigorous
mechanical dispersion. SEDDS, as opposed to emulsions or microemulsions, spontaneously
form emulsions when added to an excess of water without any external mechanical dispersion or
agitation. An advantage of SEDDS is that only gentle mixing is required to distribute the
droplets throughout the solution. Additionally, water or the aqueous phase can be added just
prior to administration, which ensures stability of an unstable or hydrophobic active ingredient.
Thus, the SEDDS provides an effective delivery system for oral and parenteral delivery of
hydrophobic active ingredients. SEDDS may provide improvements in the bioavailability of
hydrophobic active ingredients. Methods of producing self-emulsifying dosage forms are known
in the art and include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,858,401, 6,667,048,
and 6,960,563, each of which is specifically incorporated by reference.
[00512]          It is to be appreciated that there is overlap between the above-listed additives
used in the aqueous dispersions or suspensions described herein, since a given additive is often
classified differently by different practitioners in the field, or is commonly used for any of
several different functions. Thus, the above-listed additives should be taken as merely
exemplary, and not limiting, of the types of additives that can be included in formulations
described herein. The amounts of such additives can be readily determined by one skilled in the
art, according to the particular properties desired.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,476,116, 5,116,817 and 6,391,452, each of which is specifically incorporated by
reference. Formulations that include a compound of any of Formula (Al-A6), Formula (B1-B6),
Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6), which are prepared according to these and other
techniques well-known in the art are prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol
or other suitable preservatives, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents
known in the art. See, for example, Ansel, H. C. et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug
Delivery Systems, Sixth Ed. (1995). Preferably these compositions and formulations are
prepared with suitable nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients. These ingredients are
known to those skilled in the preparation of nasal dosage forms and some of these can be found
in REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY, 21st edition, 2005, a
standard reference in the field. The choice of suitable carriers is highly dependent upon the exact
                                                     - 164-

nature of the nasal dosage form desired, e.g., solutions, suspensions, ointments, or gels. Nasal
dosage forms generally contain large amounts of water in addition to the active ingredient.
Minor amounts of other ingredients such as pH adjusters, emulsifiers or dispersing agents,
preservatives, surfactants, gelling agents, or buffering and other stabilizing and solubilizing
agents may also be present. The nasal dosage form should be isotonic with nasal secretions.
[00514]          For administration by inhalation, the compounds of any of Formula D or the
second agent, described herein may be in a form as an aerosol, a mist or a powder.
Pharmaceutical compositions described herein are conveniently delivered in the form of an
aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable
propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane,
carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be
determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, such
as, by way of example only, gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated
containing a powder mix of the compound described herein and a suitable powder base such as
lactose or starch.
Buccal Formulations
[005151          Buccal formulations that include compounds of any of Formula D or the second
agent may be administered using a variety of formulations known in the art. For example, such
formulations include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,229,447, 4,596,795, 4,755,386, and
5,739,136, each of which is specifically incorporated by reference. In addition, the buccal
dosage forms described herein can further include a bioerodible (hydrolysable) polymeric carrier
that also serves to adhere the dosage form to the buccal mucosa. The buccal dosage form is
fabricated so as to erode gradually over a predetermined time period, wherein the delivery of the
compound of any of Formula D or the second agent, is provided essentially throughout. Buccal
drug delivery, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, avoids the disadvantages
encountered with oral drug administration, e.g., slow absorption, degradation of the active agent
by fluids present in the gastrointestinal tract and/or first-pass inactivation in the liver. With
regard to the bioerodible (hydrolysable) polymeric carrier, it will be appreciated that virtually
any such carrier can be used, so long as the desired drug release profile is not compromised, and
the carrier is compatible with the compound of any of Formula D or the second agent, and any
other components that may be present in the buccal dosage unit. Generally, the polymeric carrier
comprises hydrophilic (water-soluble and water-swellable) polymers that adhere to the wet
surface of the buccal mucosa. Examples of polymeric carriers useful herein include acrylic acid
polymers and co, e.g., those known as "carbomers" (Carbopol*, which may be obtained from
B.F. Goodrich, is one such polymer). Other components may also be incorporated into the
                                                   - 165 -

buccal dosage forms described herein include, but are not limited to, disintegrants, diluents,
binders, lubricants, flavoring, colorants, preservatives, and the like. For buccal or sublingual
administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, or gels formulated in a
conventional manner.
Transdermal Formulations
[00516]         Transdermal formulations described herein may be administered using a variety
of devices which have been described in the art. For example, such devices include, but are not
limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,598,122, 3,598,123, 3,710,795, 3,731,683, 3,742,951, 3,814,097,
3,921,636, 3,972,995, 3,993,072, 3,993,073, 3,996,934, 4,031,894, 4,060,084, 4,069,307,
4,077,407, 4,201,211, 4,230,105, 4,292,299, 4,292,303, 5,336,168, 5,665,378, 5,837,280,
5,869,090, 6,923,983, 6,929,801 and 6,946,144, each of which is specifically incorporated by
reference in its entirety.
[005171         The transdermal dosage forms described herein may incorporate certain
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are conventional in the art. In one embodiments,
the transdermal formulations described herein include at least three components: (1) a
formulation of a compound of any of Formula D or the second agent; (2) a penetration enhancer;
and (3) an aqueous adjuvant. In addition, transdermal formulations can include additional
components such as, but not limited to, gelling agents, creams and ointment bases, and the like.
In some embodiments, the transdermal formulation can further include a woven or non-woven
backing material to enhance absorption and prevent the removal of the transdermal formulation
from the skin. In other embodiments, the transdermal formulations described herein can
maintain a saturated or supersaturated state to promote diffusion into the skin.
[00518]         Formulations suitable for transdermal administration of compounds described
herein may employ transdermal delivery devices and transdermal delivery patches and can be
lipophilic emulsions or buffered, aqueous solutions, dissolved and/or dispersed in a polymer or
an adhesive. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery
of pharmaceutical agents. Still further, transdermal delivery of the compounds described herein
can be accomplished by means of iontophoretic patches and the like. Additionally, transdermal
patches can provide controlled delivery of the compounds of any of Formula D or the second
agent. The rate of absorption can be slowed by using rate-controlling membranes or by trapping
the compound within a polymer matrix or gel. Conversely, absorption enhancers can be used to
increase absorption. An absorption enhancer or carrier can include absorbable pharmaceutically
acceptable solvents to assist passage through the skin. For example, transdermal devices are in
the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound
optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound to the skin
                                                  - 166-

of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and means to
secure the device to the skin.
Injectable Formulations
[005191         Formulations that include a compound of any of Formula D or the second agent,
suitable for intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection may include physiologically
acceptable sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, and
sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of
suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers, diluents, solvents, or vehicles including water,
ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol, polyethylene-glycol, glycerol, cremophor and the like),
suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as
ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as
lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the
use of surfactants. Formulations suitable for subcutaneous injection may also contain additives
such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the growth of
microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, such as parabens,
chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic
agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable
pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, such as
aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
[00520]         For intravenous injections, compounds described herein may be formulated in
aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution,
Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants
appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are
generally known in the art. For other parenteral injections, appropriate formulations may include
aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, preferably with physiologically compatible buffers or
excipients. Such excipients are generally known in the art.
[00521]         Parenteral injections may involve bolus injection or continuous infusion.
Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in
multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The pharmaceutical composition described
herein may be in a form suitable for parenteral injection as a sterile suspensions, solutions or
emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending,
stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration
include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally,
suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions.
Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty
                                                   - 167 -

acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions
may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium
carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain
suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the
preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in
powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.
Other Formulations
[00522]          In certain embodiments, delivery systems for pharmaceutical compounds may be
employed, such as, for example, liposomes and emulsions. In certain embodiments,
compositions provided herein can also include an mucoadhesive polymer, selected from among,
for example, carboxymethylcellulose, carbomer (acrylic acid polymer),
poly(methylmethacrylate), polyacrylamide, polycarbophil, acrylic acid/butyl acrylate
copolymer, sodium alginate and dextran.
[00523]          In some embodiments, the compounds described herein may be administered
topically and can be formulated into a variety of topically administrable compositions, such as
solutions, suspensions, lotions, gels, pastes, medicated sticks, balms, creams or ointments. Such
pharmaceutical compounds can contain solubilizers, stabilizers, tonicity enhancing agents,
buffers and preservatives.
[00524]          The compounds described herein may also be formulated in rectal compositions
such as enemas, rectal gels, rectal foams, rectal aerosols, suppositories, jelly suppositories, or
retention enemas, containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other
glycerides, as well as synthetic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, PEG, and the like. In
suppository forms of the compositions, a low-melting wax such as, but not limited to, a mixture
of fatty acid glycerides, optionally in combination with cocoa butter is first melted.

thereof, in therapeutically effective amounts to said subject.
[005271          The compositions containing the compound(s) described herein can be
administered for prophylactic, therapeutic, or maintenance treatment. In some embodiments,
compositions containing the compounds described herein are administered for therapeutic
applications (e.g., administered to a patient diagnosed with a hematological malignancy). In
some embodiments, compositions containing the compounds described herein are administered
for therapeutic applications (e.g., administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of
developing a hematological malignancy). In some embodiments, compositions containing the
compounds described herein are administered to a patient who is in remission as a maintenance
therapy.
[00528]          Amounts of a compound disclosed herein will depend on the use (e.g.,
therapeutic, prophylactic, or maintenance). Amounts of a compound disclosed herein will
depend on severity and course of the disease or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health
status, weight, and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. It is
considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such therapeutically effective
amounts by routine experimentation (including, but not limited to, a dose escalation clinical

embodiments, the amount of the Btk inhibitor is about 2.5 mg/kg/day. In some embodiments, the
amount of the Btk inhibitor is about 8 mg/kg/day.
[00529]          In some embodiments, a Btk inhibitor disclosed herein is administered daily. In
some embodiments, a Btk inhibitor disclosed herein is administered every other day.
[005301          In some embodiments, a Btk inhibitor disclosed herein is administered once per
day. In some embodiments, a Btk inhibitor disclosed herein is administered twice per day. In
some embodiments, a Btk inhibitor disclosed herein is administered here times per day. In some
embodiments, a Btk inhibitor disclosed herein is administered times per day.
[005311          In some embodiments, the Btk inhibitor is administered until disease progression,
unacceptable toxicity, or individual choice. In some embodiments, the Btk inhibitor is
administered daily until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or individual choice. In some
embodiments, the Btk inhibitor is administered every other day until disease progression,
unacceptable toxicity, or individual choice.
[00532]          In the case wherein the patient's status does improve, upon the doctor's discretion
the administration of the compounds may be given continuously; alternatively, the dose of drug
being administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of
time (i.e., a "drug holiday"). The length of the drug holiday can vary between 2 days and 1 year,
including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12
days, 15 days, 20 days, 28 days, 35 days, 50 days, 70 days, 100 days, 120 days, 150 days, 180
days, 200 days, 250 days, 280 days, 300 days, 320 days, 350 days, or 365 days. The dose
reduction during a drug holiday may be from 10%-100%, including, by way of example only,
10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%,
90%, 95%, or 100%.

[005331         Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose
is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or
both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease,
disorder or condition is retained. Patients can, however, require intermittent treatment on a long
term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.
[00534]         The amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary
depending upon factors such as the particular compound, the severity of the disease, the identity
(e.g., weight) of the subject or host in need of treatment, but can nevertheless be routinely
determined in a manner known in the art according to the particular circumstances surrounding
the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, and
the subject or host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment
will typically be in the range of 0.02-5000 mg per day, or from about 1-1500 mg per day. The
desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered
simultaneously (or over a short period of time) or at appropriate intervals, for example as two,
three, four or more sub-doses per day.
[005351         The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in unit dosage forms
suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is
divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compound. The unit
dosage may be in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non
limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Aqueous
suspension compositions can be packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers.
Alternatively, multiple-dose reclosable containers can be used, in which case it is typical to
include a preservative in the composition. By way of example only, formulations for parenteral
injection may be presented in unit dosage form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules,
or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. In some embodiments, each unit dosage
form comprises 210 mg of a compound disclosed herein. In some embodiments, an individual is
administered 1 unit dosage form per day. In some embodiments, an individual is administered 2
unit dosage forms per day. In some embodiments, an individual is administered 3 unit dosage
forms per day. In some embodiments, an individual is administered 4 unit dosage forms per day.
[00536]         The foregoing ranges are merely suggestive, as the number of variables in regard
to an individual treatment regime is large, and considerable excursions from these recommended
values are not uncommon. Such dosages may be altered depending on a number of variables, not
limited to the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of
administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or
condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner.

[005371         Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic s can be determined by
standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not
limited to, the determination of the LD 50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED 50
(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between the toxic
and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD 50
and ED 50 . Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from
cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in
human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating
concentrations that include the ED 50 with minimal toxicity. The dosage may vary within this
range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.
Kits/Articles of Manufacture
[00538]         The present invention also encompasses kits for carrying out the methods of the
present invention. For example, the kit can comprise a labeled compound or agent capable of
detecting a biomarker described herein, e.g., a biomarker of apoptosis, cellular proliferation or
survival, or a Btk-mediated signaling pathway, either at the protein or nucleic acid level, in a
biological sample and means for determining the amount of the biomarker in the sample (for
example, an antibody or an oligonucleotide probe that binds to RNA encoding a biomarker of
interest) following incubation of the sample with a BCLD therapeutic agent of interest. Kits can
be packaged to allow for detection of multiple biomarkers of interest by including individual
labeled compounds or agents capable of detecting each individual biomarker of interest and
means for determining the amount of each biomarker in the sample.
[00539]         The particular choice of the second agent used will depend upon the diagnosis of
the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate
treatment protocol of the Btk inhibitors.

[00541]          The clinical studies provided hereinbelow are exemplified with the irreversible
Btk inhibitor (R)-1-(3-(4-amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-1
yl)piperidin- 1-yl)prop-2-en- 1-one (i.e. PCI-32765/ibrutinib). In some embodiments, such
studies are performed using a Btk inhibitor of any of Formulas (A), (Al), (B), (BI), (C), (C1),
(D), (Dl), (E) or (F). In some embodiments, such studies are performed using a Btk inhibitor of
Formula D.
Example 1: Clinical Trial to Determine Safety and Efficacy of the Btk Inhibitor PCI-32765
[00542]          The primary endpoints of the first-in-human dose-escalation study of PCI-32765
were to determine the adverse event profile; to determine Btk active site occupancy; to find the
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) (if the MTD was not reached, the maximum dose would be 3
dose levels above the dose that achieved full Btk occupancy); and to determine the
pharmacokinetics (PK) of PCI-32765. The secondary endpoint was to assess tumor response to
PCI-32765 monotherapy.
[005431          The dose-escalation portion of this open-label trial enrolled subjects with B-cell
malignancies (histologies listed in Table 2, below) and is now completed.
[00544]          Five dose levels (total n=56) were tested using a 28 day on and 7 day off
treatment schedule; the dose levels were 1.25 (n=7), 2.5 (n=9), 5.0 (n=6), 8.3 (n=8) and 12.5
(n=7) mg/kg/day. Two additional groups of patients received continuous daily dosing in 35 day
schedules: one group received 8.3 mg/kg/day (n=10) while the other group received 560 mg/day
("fixed" cohort; n=9). Patients with ABC DLBCL were treated at 560 mg/day; enrollment of
patients with other histologies has been completed and data from these patients have been
reported (Advani et al., 2010).
[005451          Seven complete responses (CRs) and 23 partial response (PRs) were documented
in 56 total patients; an additional 10 subjects had stable disease (SD). Responses have been
observed at all dose levels and in all histologies. Response data is summarized in Table 2
(below).

documented: one subject had a prolonged neutropenia at the 2.5 mg/kg/day dose level and
another subject had an allergic reaction at the 8.3 mg/kg/day dose level. No DLTs were observed
at the final dose level (12.5 mg/kg/day). Full Btk occupancy was observed in all patients at the
2.5 mg/kg dose level.
[005471              Day 1 and Day 8 (steady-state) pharmacokinetic results are presented in Tables 3

[005481             Day 1 area-under-the-curve values were estimated from 0 to infinity (AUCo_)
and at steady-state from 0 to 24 hours post-dose            (AUCO- 2 4 h). Cmax and AUC values increased
with increasing dose from 1.25 to 12.5 mg/kg on Day 1 and at steady-state. Dose-normalized
Cmax and AUC values at steady-state generally showed dose proportional increases, however
greater than dose proportional increases were observed at the 2.5-mg/kg dose level on Day 1 and
at steady-state. The time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) ranged from 1.0 to 2.3 hours.
The mean half-life of the compound of formula D post-Tmax ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 hours. In
patients who received body-weight normalized doses (mg/kg/day), high intersubject variability
was seen across all dose levels with regard to Day 1 AUCo_. and mean steady-state (Day 8)
AUCO- 2 4 h. Administration of a 560 mg/day fixed dose resulted in a mean systemic exposure to
compound of formula D, measured as AUCo_., that was intermediate to mean exposures
measured at the 5 and 8.3 mg/kg dose levels. At steady state (Day 8), systemic exposures in
subjects that received a 560-mg fixed dose had less intersubject variability (measured as
coefficient of variation for AUCo- 2 4 ) when compared with exposures in subjects who received
body-weight normalized doses.
[00549]             Analysis of PK and pharmacodynamic profiles on Day 1 showed that Btk active
site occupancy was saturated 4 and 24 hours postdose at AUC values of >200 ng-h/mL. At
steady-state, all subjects who received dosages >2.5 mg/kg/day had AUC values >245 ng-h/mL.
This indicates that despite the brief plasma half-life of compound of PCI-32765, it is an effective
irreversible inhibitor for at least 24 hours, and therefore once-daily dosing is sufficient to
maintain complete occupancy of the Btk active site.
[005501             In CLL, PCI-32765 inhibits chemokine-secretion and chemokine-mediated
malignant cell migration and adhesion. As a correlative study within clinical trial, patients'
primary tumor samples were co-cultured with nurse-like cells and incubated for 24 hours with 1
nM PCI-32765. After treatment, secreted levels of CCL3 dropped from 393  172 pg/tL to 54
46 pg/tL (p<0.05) and levels of CCL4 dropped from 2550  678 pg/tL to 394  188 pg/mL
(p<0.05). Furthermore, in primary CLL cultures derived from patient samples from the same
                                                          -  175  -

trial, 1 pM PCI-32765 reduced CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis (57 + 9% of control, n=10) and
CXCL13-mediated chemotaxis (46 + 5% of control, n=10). Plasma samples from CLL patients
on this trial revealed high pre-treatment CCL3/4 levels, and these levels were significantly
decreased after treatment: 24 hours following the first dose of PCI-32765, CCL3 levels
decreased from 60  29 pg/mL to 16  13 pg/mL, and CCL4 pre-treatment levels decreased
from 106  55 pg/mL to 23  12 pg/mL (n=6)

[005591          Tumor assessment was performed every 2 treatment cycles.
[00560]           Study Objectives:
[00561]           1. Describe the characteristics of the antitumor effect of PCI-32765 in individuals
with CLL/SLL, e.g., reduction in lymphadenopathy/splenomegaly, and kinetics of change in
absolute lymphocyte count (ACL).
[00562]          2. Summarize the safety profile of PCI-32765.
[00563]          Inclusion Criteria:

        the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety, interfere with the
        absorption or metabolism of PCI-32765 PO, or put the study outcomes at undue risk
        *    Any immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or experimental therapy within 4
        weeks before first dose of study drug (corticosteroids for disease-related symptoms
        allowed but require 1-week washout before study drug administration)

[00565            Response Criteria:
[00566]           NHL IWG criterial were applied to SLL cases without modification.
[005671           The 2008 CLL IWG criteria were applied to CLL cases with the following
modifications:
[00568]           1) An isolated lymphocytosis, in the absence of other parameters meeting the
criteria for PD, was not considered PD
[00569]           2) Patients experiencing a lymphocytosis, but obtaining a PR by other measurable
parameters, were classified as "nodal" response until there was a 50% reduction in ALC from
baseline in which case they were categorized as PR.
[005701           3) Patients with a normal ALC (<5K) at baseline with treatment-related
lymphocytosis required normalization to <5K to be categorized as PR.

[005731          Results from this study are further summarized in Figs. 2-7. Figure 2 depicts the
LN response in patient suffering from CLL prior to and following treatment with PCI-32765.
Figure 3 shows the decrease in tumor burden over the course treatment with PCI-32765 in R/R
CLL patients administered 420 mg/day or 840 mg/day PCI-32765. Figure 4 presents the
absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of the
lymph nodes (LN) during the course of treatment with PCI-32765 in treatment naYve or R/R
CLL patients administered 420 mg/day PCI-32765. Figure 5 presents the cumulative best
response in treatment naYve patients administered 420 mg/day PCI-32765 over successive cycles
(cycles 2, 5, 8, 11 and best response) of treatment. Figure 6 presents the cumulative best
response in R/R CLL patients administered 420 mg/day PCI-32765 over successive cycles
(cycles 2, 5, 8, 11 and best response) of treatment. Figure 7 presents a comparison between the
cumulative best response in R/R CLL patients (RR) versus treatment naYve (TN) patients
administered 420 mg/day PCI-32765 over successive cycles of treatment.

[006451         PCI-32756 in combination with ofatumumab is well-tolerated and highly active
in patient with R/R CLL/SLL/PLL. 6 Patients have been evaluated for dose limiting toxicity
(DLT) through end of cycle 2. 0 DLTs occurred in these patients. 4 patients have had end of
cycle 3 scans and blood counts. 3 of 4 are responders per IWG criteria. Among the patients with
CLL/SSL/PLL, the combination results in a 1000% ORR irrespective of genomics.
Example 6: Phase II Study of PCI-32765 in combination with Rituximab in
Relapsed/Refractory CLL
[006461         CLL patients with high-risk disease features have shorter remissions and a poor
outcome with conventional chemo-immunotherapy, particularly in the relapsed disease setting.
Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, ibrutinib (PCI-32765), thwarts B cell receptor (BCR)

signaling and is a promising new targeted therapy for patients with mature B cell malignancies,
particularly patients with CLL. Data from the Phase 1/2 trials demonstrated that high-risk CLL
patients responded equally as well as low-risk patients to ibrutinib. Single-agent ibrutinib-treated
CLL patients characteristically have delayed responses or stable disease due to persistent
lymphocytosis, caused by re-distribution of tissue-resident CLL cells into the peripheral blood.
To accelerate and improve responses and to expand upon the ibrutinib experience in high-risk
CLL patients, a Phase 2 single-center clinical trial of ibrutinib plus rituximab was conducted.
[006471         Patients were treated with ibrutinib 420 mg PO daily, in combination with weekly
rituximab (375 mg/m2 ) for weeks 1-4 (cycle 1), then daily ibrutinib plus monthly rituximab until
cycle 6, followed by daily single-agent ibrutinib. Study inclusion required high-risk disease
(dell7p or TP53 mutation [treated or untreated], patients with PFS < 36 months after frontline
chemo-immunotherapy, or relapsed CLL with del 11q.
[00648]         Patient characteristics included a median age of 65 (range 35-82); median of 2
prior therapies, 14 female and 26 male patients. Median Rai stage was 4 (range 1-4), 32
microglobulin 4.2 mg/L (2.2 -12.3), 31 patients had unmutated IGHV, only one patient mutated
IGHV, the remaining patients had inconclusive IGHV results. 19 patients had dell7p or TP53
mutation (4 without prior therapy), and 13 patients had dell lq. At a median follow up of 4
months, 38 of 40 patients continue on therapy without disease progression. 1 patient died from
an unrelated infectious complication, and one patient withdrew consent before starting therapy.
Out of 20 patients evaluable for early response assessment at 3 months, 17 patients achieved a
partial remission (PR) for an ORR of 85%, and three achieved a PR with persistent
lymphocytosis. Interestingly, on this combination trial, the re-distribution lymphocytosis peaked
earlier and the duration was shorter (see Figure) than with single-agent ibrutinib, presumably
due to the addition of rituximab.
[00649]         Treatment was well tolerated, with only 13 cases of grade 3 (n=1 1) or grade 4
(n=2) toxicities, which were largely unrelated and transient, such as neutropenia, fatigue,
pneumonia (n= 1), insomnia, and bone aches. Questionnaires revealed an improved overall
health and quality of life after 3 cycles of treatment in the evaluable patients (n=21). Conclusion:
ibrutinib in combination with rituximab is a safe, well tolerated regimen for high-risk CLL
patients, which induces very high early response rates.
Example 7: Phase I Study of PCI-32765 in combination with Bendamustine and Rituximab
in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
[006501         This phase I study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose
limiting toxicity (DLT), toxicities, and preliminary efficacy of R-bendamustine in combination
with ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL.
                                                   - 192 -

[006511         Eligibility included patients with relapsed/refractory FL, MZL, MCL,
transformed NHL, and DLBCL, and patients with previously untreated MCL not candidates for
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). ANC > 1000/mm3 , platelets > 50,000/mm3 , and
creatinine < 2.0 mg/dL were required at study entry. Prior ASCT, rituximab, bendamustine, and
ibrutinib were permitted. Treatment consisted of R 375 mg/m2 day 1, bendamustine 90 mg/m2
days 1 and 2, and escalating doses of ibrutinib (280 mg or 560 mg) days 1-28 every 28 days for
6 cycles. Six patients were enrolled at each dose level. Responding patients could continue
ibrutinib alone after cycle 6 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Pegfilgrastim was
permitted for patients with grade 4 neutropenia during cycles 1-6. Response was assessed after
cycles 3 and 6 by International Harmonization Criteria (Cheson, JCO 2007).
[00652]         Eleven patients (9 males) with a median age of 72 (range 45-84) previously
treated with a median of 3 prior therapies (range 0-10) were enrolled. Six patients were
refractory to their most recent therapy, 4 patients had prior ASCT, 2 patients had received prior
bendamustine, and 0 patients had prior ibrutinib. Other characteristics included stage III-IV
disease in 82%, elevated IPI > 3 in 64%, extranodal involvement in 64%, bulky adenopathy > 5
cm in 45%, B-symptoms in 45%, and elevated LDH in 36%. Histologies included MCL (n=3),
DLBCL (n=3), transformed NHL (n=2), FL (n=2), MZL (n=1). Nine patients completed two or
more cycles of therapy (median 3, range 1-6) with 280 mg of ibrutinib (n=6) and 560 mg of
ibrutinib (n=3), and 2 patients discontinued therapy prior to completing cycle 1 for progressive
disease (PD) at 280 mg and 560 mg of ibrutinib, respectively, were replaced. Six patients
continue to receive protocol treatment. The 5 patients off study included the 2 patients with
DLBCL and transformed NHL who were replaced for PD prior to completing cycle 1, 2 patients
with DLBCL and PD after cycles 3 and 4, and 1 patient with MCL receiving 280 mg ibrutinib
with bendamustine (90 mg/m 2 ) who discontinued due to grade 3 neutropenia lasting > 14 days
after cycle 4. No DLTs have been observed. Grade 3-4 events included lymphopenia (64%),
neutropenia (27%), thrombocytopenia (18%), pancreatitis (9%), vomiting (9%), shingles (9%),
and rash (9%). Dose reductions from 280 mg ibrutinib to 140 mg were required in 3 patients for
grade 3 thrombocytopenia, pancreatitis, and rash. Bendamustine dose reductions to 60 mg/m2
were required in 1 patient for grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Dose delays occurred in 4 patients for
thrombocytopenia (n= 1), neutropenia (n= 1), pancreatitis (n= 1), and rash (n=1). ORR was 38%
in 8 evaluable patients, with 3 patients currently receiving protocol treatment who have not yet
undergone restaging scans. Responses included 2 complete responses and 1 partial response in
the 3 patients with MCL. Conclusions: Combined ibrutinib with R-bendamustine is well
tolerated without unexpected toxicity and with significant activity in patients with previously
untreated and relapsed MCL. Three additional patients will be accrued to the 560 mg dose level
                                                  - 193 -

and expansion cohorts examining this combination specifically in patients with FL, DLBCL, and
MCL are planned.

[00675]          Administration of PCI-32765 in combination with bendamustine and rituximab
resulted in 93% if patients achieving a IWCLL response with 13% complete responses (CRs).
No added toxicity was observed when adding PCI-32765 to bendamustine and rituximab. In
previous studies, bendamustine and rituximab combination therapy only achieved 59% response
including 9% CRs. Thus, PCI-32765 significantly enhances treatment when administered in
combination with bendamustine and rituximab.
[00676]          Studies with PCI-32765 in combination with FCR in patients with CLL/SLL are
in progress. 3 patients were treated in the initial study for 6 cycles. Treatment was well-tolerate
in all 3 patients with an overall response of 100% (3/3) with 2 confirmed MRD-negative CRs
(MRD negative at 10-4). All 3 patients remains progression free on PCI-32765 with a median
follow-up of 8.5 months.

[00692]         The PCI-32765 inhibited the growth of a subset of B cell lymphoma derived cell
lines, with G150 values ranging from 0.1 to 5.5 piM (see Table 5, below).
[00693]         In cell lines, PCI-32765 has demonstrated weak synergy with lenalidomide,

[006941          Treatment of primary CLL cells with 0.01 - 100 mcM of PCI-32765 resulted in:
1) dose and time-dependent apoptosis, 2) apoptosis that was not affected by genetic changes
which are known to predict for poor response to other agents, i.e., dell 1q, deli 7p, and IgVH
gene mutational status; 3) cytotoxicity accompanied by PARP cleavage and induction of
caspase-3 activity; and 4) apoptosis independent of the presence or absence of fibronectin or the
Hs5 stromal cell line, suggesting that the activity of PCI-32765 was not diminished by
microenvironmental influences.

Example 25: Effect of PCI-32765 on Lymphocvte Mobilization in Mantle Cell Lymphoma
[007501         Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) often have marked but
transient increases of circulating CLL lymphocytes following treatment with ibrutinib, as seen
with other inhibitors of the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway. In the course of the Phase I study of
ibrutinib, similar effects were noted among treated patients with other types of non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (NHL) including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). In this example, we characterized
the patterns and phenotypes of cells mobilized among patients with MCL, and further
investigate the mechanism of this effect. Peripheral blood CD19+CD5+ cells from MCL
patients treated with ibrutinib (PCI-32765) after 7 days were found to have significant reduction
in the expression of CXCR4, CD38 and Ki67 compared to pre-treatment. In addition, plasma
chemokines such as MDC, MIP-10, and CXCL13 were reduced 40-60% after one week of
treatment. Mechanistically, we found ibrutinib inhibited BCR, and chemokine mediated
adhesion and chemotaxis of MCL cell lines, and dose-dependently inhibited BCR, stromal cell
and CXCL12/CXCL13 stimulations of pBtk, pPLCy2, pErk or pAkt. Importantly, ibrutinib
dose-dependently inhibited the pseudoemperipoleisis of MCL in co-culture. We propose that
Btk is essential for the homing of MCL cells into secondary lymphoid organs, and its inhibition
results in an egress of malignant cells into peripheral blood.
Materials and Methods
[007511         Primary Human MCL Specimens from Drug Treated Patients: Blood was
drawn from MCL patients enrolled in PCYC-04753 or PCYC- 1104 studies in the US in

[00757]        MCL Phenotyping: Frozen PBMCs were thawed in a 37 0 C water bath,
resuspended in RPMI + 10% FBS, and recovered in a 37 0 C, 5% CO 2 incubator in 5 ml
polypropylene tubes (BD-Falcon) for 2 hours before phenotyping analysis. The PBMCs were
washed with PBS + 2% FBS, pelleted and resuspended in PBS + 2% FBS containing
phenotyping surface antibodies. All staining cocktails were run in duplicate tubes. The cells
were stained for 30 minutes, washed with PBS, pelleted at 1300 rpm for 5 min, then fixed in
PBS + 1.6% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services, Hatfield, PA). Cells to be
analyzed for proliferation with Ki67 were permeabilized with 70% ethanol at -20'C overnight,
rehydrated with PBS and stained with Ki-67 antibody.
[00758]        Flow Cytometry: BD FACS Canto II (BD, San Jose, CA) was used for all flow
cytometry collection. The instrument was maintained according to manufacturer's
recommendations. CS&T beads (BD) are used daily for baseline and reproducibility
measurements according to manufacturer's instructions. Phosphoflow assays were stained and
performed as described. The above antibodies were used with BD CompBead Plus to establish
compensation settings and antibody staining consistency. 10,000 CD19* cells were collected
from each staining sample. The data was analyzed and quantified using FlowJo7.6 (Tree Star,
Ashland, OR).
[00759]        Co-culture assays: Co-cultures of M2-10B4 stromal cells and the B cell line
Mino were established according to the method of Burger et al. Blood. 1999;94(11):3658-3667.
Mino cells were treated with vehicle, pertussis toxin (Sigma), or ibrutinib for one hour at 37 0 C,
washed with media, and then added to plates containing confluent monolayers of stromal cells.
The co-cultures were incubated at 37 0 C for 5 hrs to overnight to allow migration of Mino cells

beneath the stromal cell layer, after which they were washed extensively to remove unmigrated
cells. For co-cultures using live-cell tracer dyes, cells were first loaded with Alexa Fluor
CellTracker (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
For microscopy, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and mounted onto slides with DAPI
mounting medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For quantification of
migration of Mino cells in co-cultures by flow cytometry, cells were trypsinized and stained
with APC-Cy7-labeled anti-CD19 antibody (BD Laboratories). Cells were counted using
CountBright Absolute counting beads (Life Technologies) on a BD Cantoll flow cytometer.
[00760]         Actin polymerization in Mino cells: Mino cells were allowed to adhere to
coverslips in serum-free media for 30 min at 37 0 C and then treated with DMSO, pertussis toxin,
or ibrutinib for 1 hr. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton X- 100,
and stained with Alexa Fluor495-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Grand Island, NY).
Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI
(Vector Laboratories). Microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope using a
63x/1.40 oil-immersion Plan-Apochromat objective, and images were acquired with a Zeiss
AxioCam MRm CCD camera, and AxioVision v.4.8 software. For densitometry, at least 30
cells were imaged for each condition.
[00761]         Adhesion assay: The cell adhesion assays were performed essentially as
described previously. In detail, adhesion assays were done in triplicate on EIA/RIA 96-well
plates (Costar) coated overnight at 4'C with PBS containing, 10 [ig/ml fibronectin or 500ng/ml
VCAM-1, 4% BSA, or for 15 min at 37 0 C with 1mg/mL poly-l-lysine (PLL), and blocked for 2h
at 37'C with 4% BSA in RPMI 1640. Cells were pretreated with 100 nM ibrutinib, 100 nM
Wortmannin, 1IM R406 or at 37 0 C for 1h in RPMI with 1% BSA. Subsequently, cells were
                                                                                              5
stimulated with either 100ng/ml goat (Fab') 2 anti-human IgM, or 50 ng/mL PMA, and 1.5x10
Namalwa or 3x10 5 CLL-cells were immediately plated in 100 [l/well and incubated at 37 0 C for
30 min. After extensive washing of the plate with RPMI containing 1% BSA to remove non
adhered cells, the adherent cells were fixed for 10 min with 10% glutaraldehyde in PBS and
subsequently stained for 45 min with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol. After extensive
washing with water, the dye was eluted in methanol and absorbance was measured after 40 min
at 570 nm on a spectrophotometer (Multiskan RC spectrophotometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Philadephia, PA). Background absorbance (no cells added) was subtracted. Absorbance due to
nonspecific adhesion, as determined in wells coated with 4% BSA, was always less than 10% of
the absorbance of anti-IgM-stimulated cells. Maximal adhesion (100%) was determined by
applying the cells to wells coated with PLL, without washing the wells before fixation.

Adhesion of the nonpretreated anti-IgM-stimulated cells was normalized to 100% and the bars
represent the means + SEM of independent experiments, each assayed in triplicate.
[00762]         Chemokine-mediated adhesion was assayed as described above, except that the
chemokines 100 ng/mL CXCL12, 100 ng/mL CXCL13, 100 ng/mL CCL19 or 100 ng/mL
CCL21 were coimmobilized with 500 ng/mL VCAM-1. The plates were spun directly after
applying the cells to the plate, and the cells were allowed to adhere for 2 min.
[00763]         Alternatively, serum starved cells were first stimulated and allowed to adhere as
described, and ibrutinib (1IM) was added afterwards for 2h at 370 C and subsequently the plates
were washed to remove the unbound cells.
[00764]         Migration assay: Migration assays were performed essentially as described (de
Gorter et al. Immunity. 2007;26(1):93-104; de Gorter et al. Blood. 2008;111(7):3364-3372).      In
detail, migration assays in triplicate with transwells (pore size 5pm, Costar) coated with 500
ng/mL VCAM-1. The lower compartment contained 100 ng/mL CXCL 12, The cells, pretreated
with 100 nM ibrutinib at 370 C for 1h in RPMI with 0.5% BSA, were applied to the upper
compartment and allowed to migrate for 2h at 370 C. The amount of viable migrated cells was
determined by FACS and expressed as a percentage of the input.
[007651         Immunoblotting: Immunoblotting was performed essentially as described. (de
Rooij et al. Blood. 2012; 119(11):2590-2594; de Gorter et al. Blood. 2008; 111(7):3364-3372).
In detail, 107 cells/mL RPMI were pretreated with 1OOnM ibrutinib at 370 C for 1h. After
stimulation with 1OOng/ml goat anti-human IgM, (Fab') 2 or 1OOng/mL CXCL12 for 5 min (or as
indicated), cells were directly lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. 2x105 cells were applied on a
10% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted with rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA), rabbit anti-phospho-AKT, mouse anti-phospho-BTK or mouse anti-p-actin followed by
HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse and developed by enhanced
chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). To confirm equal expression and loading,
the blots were stripped and incubated with the antibodies rabbit anti-ERK2, rabbit anti-AKT and
mouse anti-BTK.
[00766]          Statistical analysis: Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (San
Diego, CA). Statistically significant differences were determined using either ANOVA with
Bonferroni's post hoc comparison or unpaired two-tailed Student's t- test was used to determine
the significance of differences between two means. The one sample t-test was used to determine
the significance of differences between means and normalized values (100%). * p <0.05; **
p<0.01; *** p<0.001.

Transient increase in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) following ibrutinib administration
to MCL patients
[00767]         In a Phase I study that enrolled patients with various B cell malignancies, MCL
patients (n=9) were treated with ibrutinib in 35-day cycles where the drug was administered
once-a-day for 28 days with a 7-day drug holiday between cycles. Under these conditions, a
cyclical pattern of increasing and decreasing ALC was observed. This was demonstrated by an
increase in ALC following the first few weeks of treatment followed by a return to baseline after
the 7-day drug holiday. This cyclic ALC pattern continued for the duration of the treatment.
During the course of ibrutinib treatments, the tumor volumes as determined by Sum of
Perpendicular Diameters (SPD) were reduced on average by 80% during evaluations following
2, 4 and 6 cycles of treatments. Therefore, during the first 6 cycles of treatment, we observed a
sawtooth pattern of increasing and decreasing peripheral blood ALC concomitant with a nodal
response in these patients. The same increase in ALC was observed in a subsequent (Phase 2)
study, where MCL patients were treated with a fixed dose of 560 mg per day without drug
holiday. In this trial, the ALC increased by 100-150% following 2-4 weeks of drug treatment.
The increase in ALC was transient with notable reductions in ALC observed by the end of the
second cycle. A continued decrease in ALC was observed until tapering off in cycle 4-5.
Elevated ALC is due to an increase of light-chain restricted CD19+CD5+ cells
[00768]         In order to define the population of lymphocytes increased by ibrutinib, the
PBMCs of patients isolated before (D1) and after one week of treatment (D8) were stained with
CD3, CD19, CD5 and analyzed by flow cytometry. The increased lymphocytes were
characterized as CD3-CD19CD5,           both the absolute count and the percentage of CD19CD5
cells in the lymphocyte population were significantly increased after one week of ibrutinib
treatment (p<0.05) whereas the CD19CD5- population was not. An illustrative patient is shown
in Figure 35, where the CD19CD3- and CD19CD5 populations before drug treatments were
9.29% and 84.4%, respectively, and increased to 63% and 98.8%, after one week of treatment.
The CD19CD3-CD5           cells were light-chain restricted (data not shown), likely reflecting
increased circulating MCL cells in the periphery following one week of drug treatment. In some
cases, the mobilized cells comprised a distinct subset of CD 4 5dim small cells, which is also
consistent with MCL.
[00769]         In order to confirm that full inhibition of the target BTK was achieved in these
patients, occupancy of the BTK active site by ibrutinib was assessed in PBMCs from MCL
patients using a competitive binding fluorescent probe assay. On average over 90% target
occupancy was observed in patients following 1 week of treatment.
                                                    -211 -

The peripheral CD19+CD5+ population is CXCR4"CD38" and decreased in Ki67 following
drug treatment.
[00770]         Next we analyzed the CD19CD5 cells for expression of CXCR4, a chemokine
receptor known to be involved in migration and homing to tissues. Surface expression of
CXCR4 was significantly reduced (p<0.05) in the CD19CD5 population following one week
of drug treatment (Figure 36A). CXCR4 and CD38 expression in CLL patients has been
reported to be lower in lymph node resident cells compared to CLL cells in peripheral blood.
Because of this, we analyzed CXCR4 and CD38 expression on patient-matched lymph nodes
and peripheral blood resident MCL cells. CXCR4 expression was lower in MCL cells isolated
from LNs compared to peripheral blood in all 3 patients examined (Figure 36D). This is
consistent with the observed newly circulating CXCR4O MCL cell population and is consistent
with the mobilized cells originating from tissues such as LNs. This notion is further supported
by the notable reduction in lymphadenopathy observed during the same period. Further study
of the mobilized population disclosed high CD38* expression corresponding to the increased
CD38 expression found in LN-resident MCL cells (Figure 36B/D). This initial increase in
CD38+ cells was significantly decreased following treatment in CD19CD5 cells (p<0.01),
while the CD19CD5- cells (which had consistently low CD38 expression) were not
significantly altered (Figure 36B/C).
[007711         Next we examined changes to markers of proliferative capacity as well as homing
and migration in the mobilized fraction. Intracellular Ki67 expression was significantly reduced
after treatment (p<0.05) (Figure 36C). Phosphorylated ERK was also reduced, as demonstrated
by phospho-flow cytometry, in the CD20CD5 subpopulation from patients before and after
treatment. pErk expression was generally higher in MCL patients' CD20CD5 cells compared
to healthy volunteers and was reduced by ibrutinib treatment (Figure 36C, lower panel) although
these differences were not statistically significant.
[00772]         In addition, chemokines important in homing (MDC, MIP-10, CXCL13 and
CXCL17) were reduced on average by more than 50% following one week of treatment. By the
end of the first cycle of treatment, in addition to the decrease of MIP-1 0 and MDC, IL-10 and
TNF-a were also reduced by 50% (Figure 36E).
Ibrutinib inhibits pseudoemperipoliesis in MCL/stromal co-culture
[00773]         The transient increase of ALC in MCL patients treated with ibrutinib may be due
to a disruption in cellular adhesion and migration within the lymph node or tissue compartment.
To investigate this, we established MCL-stromal cell co-cultures to determine the effect of drug
in vitro. Primary MCL cells or the Mino cell line were grown in co-culture with murine bone
marrow stromal cells M2-10B4. We found that primary MCL cells or Mino cells both adhered
                                                   - 212 -

and quickly migrated beneath the M2-10B4 cells (pseudoemperipoliesis). Significant inhibition
of pseudoemperipoliesis by ibrutinib was observed, as demonstrated by light microscopy and the
number of Mino cells or primary MCL remaining in the co-culture were quantified by flow
cytometry of hCD19* cells harvested by gentle washing following 4 hrs of co-culture (Figure 37
A and 37B, left panels).    Ibrutinib dose-dependently inhibited migration of Mino cells beneath
the stromal cells, and the inhibition was significant at 100 nM (p<O.01) and 1000 nM (p<O.00 1).
Pertussin toxin, a well-studied GPCR inhibitor used as a positive control for inhibition of Mino
cell migration significantly inhibited migration at 200 ng/mL (p<0.001).     In addition, CXCL12,
an important chemokine for B cell homing and produced by stromal cells, increased cortical
actin of Mino cells, as assessed by Phalloidin fluorescence microscopy, and this response was
also dose-dependently and significantly inhibited by ibrutinib treatments at 10 and 100 nM
(p<0.001) (Figure 37A right panel). Ibrutinib also suppressed actin polymerization of primary
MCL in co-culture at 100 nM (p<0.001) (Figure 37B, right panel).
Ibrutinib inhibits Btk activity in MCL/stromal co-culture and suppresses stromal cell
induced chemokine and cytokine secretion
[00774]         To further understand the effect of the drug on MCL cells in co-culture with
stromal cells, Mino cells were treated with drug and co-cultured with murine stromal cells (M2
10B4) or stimulated with anti-IgM. Ibrutinib dose-dependently inhibited pBtk, pPLCy2 and
pAkt in Mino cells alone, or in co-culture with M2 cells. Chemokine and cytokine
concentrations of conditioned media were determined from ibrutinib treated MCL cell lines
alone or in co-culture with M2 stromal cells or stimulated with anti-IgM. Despite lack of
detectable activation of signaling proteins upon co-culture with M2, Mino cells increased
chemokine and cytokine secretions following BCR stimulations or co-culture. Similar results
were observed with the Jeko cell line. Ibrutinib dose dependently and potently suppressed
production of human IL-10, MDC, MIP-la, MIP-10, TNFa, CCL17 and CCL21 following BCR
activation or in co-culture whereas the murine stromal cells alone did not produce human
chemokines or cytokines. Similarly, ibrutinib suppressed the production of IL-10, MDC, MIP
lIa, MIP-10, TNFa of Jeko l cells in co-culture with M2-10B4 or human stromal cell line HS-5.
These in vitro results with MCL cell lines correlate well with the plasma chemokine/cytokine
reduction in ibrutinib treated patients.
Ibrutinib inhibits BCR- and chemokine mediated adhesion and migration in vitro
[007751         We measured the direct effect of ibrutinib on migration and adhesion of the MCL
cell lines Mino, Jeko 1 and JVM- 1. First, the effect of ibrutinib on Btk signaling was determined
in these MCL cells. As expected, ibrutinib inhibited phosphorylation of Btk and downstream
signaling proteins PLCy2, MAP kinases Erk, JNK and Akt following anti-IgM and chemokine
                                                  - 213 -

CXCL12 and CXCL13 stimulations. Cell surface expression of CXCR4, CXCR5, CCR7,
surface IgM, and a4P1 integrin was confirmed by flow cytometry, and subsequent in vitro
adhesion and chemotaxis assays were performed with drug. Ibrutinib significantly inhibited
anti-IgM stimulated adhesion of Jeko l and HBL1 cells onto fibronectin or VCAM1 at 100 nM
(a clinically relevant concentration of ibrutinib) with over 50-70% inhibition. The inhibition of
adhesion by ibrutinib was also dose-dependent.        Similarly, the adhesion of both Mino and
Jekol cells to VCAM1 or fibronectin was inhibited by ibrutinib at 100 nM following CXCL12
or CXCL13 activations. The extent of inhibition was greater in Mino cells (50-70%) than in
Jeko 1 cells (20-3 0%). In addition to changes in adhesion, we found that ibrutinib dose
dependently inhibited CXCL12-induced migration of Mino, Jeko l and JVM-1 cells with Mino
and Jeko 1 cells being more sensitive to drug than JVM- 1 cells. ibrutinib also significantly
inhibited CXCL13 stimulated migration of Mino cells dose-dependently from 1 nM to 1 gM.
[007761          Next, we examined the effect of ibrutinib on signaling and adhesion in primary
MCL cells. Phosphorylation of Y223 was increased in MCL cells compared to normal B
lymphocytes, consistent with elevated BCR signaling in malignant B cells. Ibrutinib inhibited
pBtk in both primary MCL and normal B cells on Y223, the autophosphorylation site of Btk,
and Y551 (a tyrosine phosphorylated by Src-family kinases) and reduced pPLCy2 on Y759 and
Y1217 at concentrations of 10 nM and above. These results demonstrate ibrutinib directly
inhibits Btk activity in MCL primary cells. Importantly, ibrutinib also inhibited CXCL12 or
CXCL13 activated adhesion to VCAM1 as well as BCR stimulated adhesion to fibronectin at
100 nM in primary MCL cells. The degree of inhibition in these primary cells was about 10
20%, and the magnitude was less impressive compared to the MCL cell lines but the inhibition
was statistically significant.
[007771          These studies collectively demonstrate ibrutinib inhibits BCR and CXCL12,
CXCL13 activated adhesion and migration in MCL cell lines as well as primary MCL cells
which is associated with the Btk inhibition in these cells.
