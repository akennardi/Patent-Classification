                                                            BACKGROUND
[0003]                         Human immunodeficiency virus infection and related diseases are a major
public health problem worldwide. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes
three enzymes which are required for viral replication: reverse transcriptase, protease, and
integrase. Although drugs targeting reverse transcriptase and protease are in wide use and
have shown effectiveness, particularly when employed in combination, toxicity and
development of resistant strains have limited their usefulness (Palella, et al. N. Engl. J
Med. (1998) 338:853-860; Richman, D. D. Nature (2001) 410:995-1001).
[0004]                         A goal of antiretroviral therapy is to achieve viral suppression in the HIV
infected patient. Treatment guidelines published by the United States Department of Health
and Human Services provide that achievement of viral suppression requires the use of
combination therapies, i.e., several drugs from at least two or more drug classes. In
addition, decisions regarding the treatment of HIV infected patients are complicated when
the patient requires treatment for other medical conditions. Because the standard of care
requires the use of multiple different drugs to suppress HIV, as well as to treat other
conditions the patient may be experiencing, the potential for drug interaction is a criterion
for selection of a drug regimen. As such, there is a need for antiretroviral therapies having
a decreased potential for

  [0023]           In the following description, certain specific details are set forth in order to
  provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the invention. However, one
  skilled in the art will understand that the invention may be practiced without these details,
  The description below of several embodiments is made with the understanding that the
  present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the claimed subject matter, and
  is not intended to limit the appended claims to the specific embodiments illustrated. The

 WO 2015/196116                                                                  PCT/US2015/036757
headings used throughout this disclosure are provided for convenience only and are not to be
construed to limit the claims in any way, Embodiments illustrated under any heading may be
combined with embodiments illustrated under any other heading.
Definitions
[0024]          Unless the context requires otherwise, throughout the present specification and
claims, the word "comprise" and variations thereof, such as, "comprises" and "comprising"
are to be construed in an open, inclusive sense, that is as "including, but not limited to".
[0025]          Reference throughout this specification to "one embodiment" or "an
embodiment" means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in
connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present
invention. Thus, the appearances of the phrases "in one embodiment" or "in an embodiment"
in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same
embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be
combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.
[0026]          The invention disclosed herein is also meant to encompass all
pharmaceutically acceptable compounds of Formulas (I) and (II) being isotopically-labeled
by having one or more atoms replaced by an atom having a different atomic mass or mass
number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the disclosed compounds include
isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine,
such as 2H, H I C 1C, 'C,         N, "N, " O, '7O, 18O,    P    P      "i    C;,  i, and 12I,
respectively, These radiolabeled compounds could be useful to help determine or measure the
effectiveness of the compounds, by characterizing, for example, the site or mode of action, or
binding affinity to pharmacologically important site of action. Certain isotopically-labeled
compounds of Formulas (1)and (II), for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope,
are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium,
i.e. 3H, and carbon- 14, 4.e. 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of
incorporation and ready means of detection.
[0027]          Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, ie. 2H, may afford
certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, For example, in vivo
half-life may increase or dosage requirements may be reduced. Thus, heavier isotopes may be
preferred in some circumstances.

[0028]           Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as "C, "9F, "O and      3N, can
be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor
occupancy. Isotopically-labeled compounds of Formulas (I) and (11) can generally be
prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes
analogous to those described in the Examples as set out below using an appropriate
isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.
[0029]           "Stable compound" and "stable structure" are meant to indicate a compound
that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction
mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent.
[0030]           "Optiona" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described event or
circumstances may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said
event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, "optionally
substituted aryl" means that the aryl radical may or may not be substituted and that the
description includes both substituted aryl radicals and aryl radicals having no substitution,
[0031]           "Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient" includes without
limitation any adjuvant, carrier, excipient, glidant, sweetening agent, diluent preservative,
dye/colorant, flavor enhancer surfactant, wetting agent, dispersing agent, suspending agent,
stabilizer, isotonic agent, solvent, or emulsifier which has been approved by the United States
Food and Drug Adninistration as being acceptable for use in humans or domestic animals,
[0032]           A "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a formulation of a compound of the
invention and a medium generally accepted in the art for the delivery of the biologically
active compound to mammals, e.g,, humans. Such a medium includes all phannaceutically
acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients therefo.
[0033]           "Effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount
of a compound according to the invention, which when administered to a patient in need
thereof, is sufficient to effect treatment for disease-states, conditions, or disorders for which
the compounds have utility. Such an amount would be sufficient to elicit the biological or
med ical response of a tissue system, or patient that is sought by a researcher or clinician. The
amount of a compound according to the invention which constitutes a therapeutically
effective amount will vary depending on such factors as the compound and its biological
activity, the composition used for administration, the time of administration, the route of
                                                   6

XRPD Dt a
[0102]           In certain embodiments, the crystalline forms are characterized by the
interlattice plane intervals determined by an X-ray powder diffiraction pattern (XRPD). The
diffractogram of XRPD is typically represented by a diagram plotting the intensity of the
peaks versus the location of the peaks, i.e., diffraction angle 20 (two-theta) in degrees. The
intensities are often given in parenthesis with the following abbreviations; very strong = vst;
strong = st; medium = m; weak = w; and very weak = vw, 'Techaracteristic peaks of a given
XRPD can be selected according to the peak locations and their relative intensity to
conveniently distinguish this crystalline structure from others,
 [0103]           Those skilled in the art recognize that the measurements of the XRPD peak
 locations and/or intensity for a given crystalline form of the same compound will vary within
 a margin of error. The values of degree 20 allow appropriate error margins. Typically, the
 error margins are represented by " ".,For example, the degree 20 of about "8.70.3" denotes
 a range from about 8.7+0.3, i.e., about 9,0, to about 8.7-0.3, i.e., about 8.   Depending on the
 sample preparation techniques, the calibration techniques applied to the instruments, human
 operational variation, and etc, those skilled in the art recognize that the appropriate error of
 margins for a XRPD can be 0.5; +0.4; +0,3; 0.2; +0,1; &0,05; or less. In certain
 embodiments of the invention, the XRPD margin of error is 0.2,

 increased from the initial level 50% RH to 60% RH and held until the solid and atmosphere
 reached equilibration. The equilibrium test was continued until passed or expired after 10
 hours. At this point, RH was raised 10% higher and the process was repeated until 90% RH
 was reached and equilibrated. During this period, the water sorption was monitored. For
 desorption, the relative humidity was decreased in a similar manner to measure a full
  sorption/desorption cycle. The cycle was optionally repeated. All experiments were operated
