              LOAD COMPENSATOR HAVING TENSION SPRING ASSEMBLIES
                               CONTAINED IN A TUBULAR HOUSING
             Technical Field
  5          [0001]      The present invention relates to tension spring assemblies.
             Background Art
             [0002]      Elastomeric springs have been used in a number of applications to
     provide an opposing force of compression, torsion, or tension, in response to an
 10  applied displacement.     The amount of opposing force provided by the elastomeric
     spring in response to a unit of displacement is known as the spring rate. Elastomeric
     springs have also been designed to put the elastomer of the spring in tension, shear, or
     compression in response to the applied displacement.          By selecting whether the
     elastomer is put in tension, shear, or compression, elastomeric springs have been
 15  designed for rather linear spring rates and for non-linear spring rates. For example,
     compression of the elastomer typically results in a non-linear spring rate having a
     progressive increase in restoring force per unit of displacement as the elastomer is
     compressed.
             [0003]      Some examples of applications using elastomeric springs include
20   exercise equipment (Whightsil, Sr. U.S. Patent 5,209,461), drive-line couplings (Arlt
     U.S. Patents 4,627,885 and 5,753,463), energy absorbers (Robinson U.S. Patent
     6,141,919), flexible pipe joints (Herbert et al. U.S. Patent 4,076,284), and riser
     tensioner systems (Arlt et al. U.S. Patents 5,366,324 and 5,641,248).
             [0004]      Offshore cranes are subject to load variations when making an off
25   board lift of a payload from a floating vessel such as a supply vessel or materials
     barge. Severe sea conditions cause heave motion of the floating vessel, and have the
     effect of placing a transient load upon the crane in excess of the weight of the payload
     when the payload is lifted off the floating vessel.
             [0005]      Severe sea conditions are considered in industry standards for
 30  offshore cranes.    For example, the American Petroleum Institute Specification for
     Offshore Pedestal Mounted Cranes, API-2C, Seventh Edition, March 2012, requires
     the crane manufacturer to account for sea conditions by using a Dynamic Factor (Cv).
     The crane capacity for off-board lifts must be de-rated by the Cv.     The minimum Cv

WO 2015/136488                                                            PCT/IB2015/051827
                                                  2
     allowed by the API-2C specification is 1.4 for cranes installed on floating applications
     and 1.33 for cranes installed on fixed structures. In some cases, Cv will range from 2
     to 4. For example, a Cv of 2.8 means that the crane lifting capability at a particular
     radius from the pedestal mount is one-half of what it could be at the API-2C
  5  minimum for the same radius. The Cv is calculated at spaced radii over the range of
     radii for the crane, and it is a function of three variables.     The first variable is a
     "significant wave height" specified by the customer for the particular marine
     environment that the crane is designed to operate in. An increase in the "significant
     wave height" has the effect of raising Cv and reducing the safe working load of the
 10  crane.    The second variable is the crane geometry.        The third variable is crane
     stiffness taking into account all elements from the hook through the pedestal structure.
     See, for example, Figure 8 on page 61 of the API-2C specification, and Section 5.4 on
     pages 23-31 of the API-2C specification.
              [0006]     Heave compensation of a crane is a method of compensating for
 15  the load variations due to heave motion of the crane or the support from which the
     crane is lifting the payload.      Heave compensation attempts to reduce the load
     variations by raising or lowering the payload to counteract the effect of the heave
     motions. For example, the objective is for the payload to track a desired reference
     trajectory in an earth fixed frame without being influenced by heave motions. Heave
20   compensation      has   employed     passive   components,   active   components,     and
     combinations of active and passive components.           The passive components have
     included springs and counter-weights that react to an increase in loading from the
     payload by reducing the payload acceleration, so that the crane tends to apply a more
     constant lifting force upon the payload. The active components have included sensors
25   that measure motion of the crane, the payload, or its support, and hydraulic cylinders
     or winch motors that are actuated in response to the sensor signals in order to
     counteract the effect of the heave motion.      See, for example, Jorg Neupert et al., A
     Heave Compensation Approach for Offshore Cranes, 2008 American                    Control
     Conference, Westin Seattle Hotel, Seattle, Washington, June 11-13, 2008, pages 538

              Disclosure of Invention
  5           [0008]     The present disclosure describes a load compensator using a series
     combination of in-line tension spring assemblies stacked within a common tubular
     housing. This configuration permits a variety of load compensators of different sizes
     and aspect ratios to be assembled using many instances of the same component parts.
     This reduces the manufacturing cost because the cost per part decreases with the
 10  number of parts that are made. Also there is a reduction in the cost of maintaining an
     inventory of parts for manufacture, repair, or replacement because of the reduction in
     the number of different kinds of parts.
              [0009]     For example, each tension spring assembly includes a plurality of
     elastomeric tension elements mechanically connected in parallel.        Tension spring
 15  assemblies of different diameters can be made by including a different number of the
     same kind of elastomeric tension element.          Any number of the tension spring
     assemblies can be fastened to each other so that they are in line with each other and
     stacked in a common tubular housing so as to share the tubular housing. Moreover,
     the fasteners and the housing can be configured for rapid assembly and disassembly
20   for replacement or re-use of the parts.       Such an elastomeric load compensator
     provides a convenient, reliable, and relatively lightweight mechanism for load
     compensation in comparison to the mechanical spring, counterweight, and hydraulic
     mechanisms that have been used for load compensation.         Such an elastomeric load
     compensator may provide a rather linear spring rate and some shock and vibration
25   adsorption.
              [00010]    Such an elastomeric load compensator is especially suited for load
     compensation of a crane.       The elastomeric load compensator reduces the crane
     stiffness and reduces the Dynamic Factor (Cv) in such a way as to significantly
     increase the off-board crane load ratings for a given crane model. In most cases, this
 30  allows for the use of a smaller crane model for a given customer or project
     requirement. The smaller crane model has lower design requirements for the crane
     pedestal support structure, which is a significant consideration in the platform design
     for the customer. This reduces the platform construction costs for the customer. The

WO 2015/136488                                                            PCT/IB2015/051827
                                                 4
     production costs for the smaller crane model are also lower. In most cases, there is an
     average cost difference      of approximately    ten percent between models.         The
     elastomeric load compensator may reduce the appropriate model size by one to three
     models, depending on the requirements, for an average reduced production cost of ten
  5  to thirty percent.
              [00011]    In accordance with one aspect, the present disclosure describes a
     load compensator. The load compensator includes a tubular housing, and at least two
     tension spring assemblies adapted for connection to a load and mechanically
     connected to each other in series so that tension from the load is applied to each of the
 10  tension spring assemblies and the load compensator provides an elongation to the load
     that includes a sum of elongations from each of the tension spring assemblies. The
     tension assemblies are stacked in-line with each other in the tubular housing.
              [00012]    In accordance with another aspect, the present disclosure describes
     a load compensator having a tubular housing, and at least one tension spring assembly
 15  having a first end adapted for connection to a load and a second end mechanically
     connected to the tubular housing so that tension from the load is applied to the tension
     spring assembly. At least one tension spring assembly is disposed within the tubular
     housing and the first end of the at least one tension spring assembly slides against an
     inner surface of the tubular housing when the at least one tension spring assembly
20   elongates as the tension from the load is applied to the tension assembly. The tubular
     housing has a fixed length greater than a length of the at least one tension spring
     assembly when the at least one tension spring assembly has a maximum elongation
     under a maximum amount of tension from the applied load so that the at least one
     tension spring assembly is contained within the tubular housing under the maximum
25   amount of tension from the applied load.

               Modes for Carrying Out the Invention
               [00041]   FIG. 1 shows an offshore crane 20 that is susceptible to heave
     loads when performing an off-board lift of a payload 24 from a floating vessel 19. In
     general, the crane 20 has a base 21, a boom 22 mounted to the base 21, a hoist rope 23
20   descending from the boom for attachment to the payload 24, and a hoist mechanism
     25 mounted to the base 21 or to the boom 22 for applying tension to the hoist rope 23
     to lift the payload 24.
               [00042]   In particular, the crane 20 is a pedestal-mounted offshore crane
     having a box-frame boom 22. A specific example of such a crane is a NAUTILUS@
25   brand of pedestal marine crane Model 180B-70 sold by Oil States Industries, Inc. of
     Arlington, Texas, through its related companies Oil States Skagit Smatco, LLC, Oil
     States Industries (Thailand) Ltd, and Oil States Industries (India) Pvt. Ltd. The base
     21 is a cylindrical pedestal, and the boom 22 is mounted to the pedestal via a swing
     circle assembly 26. The swing circle assembly 26 rotates the boom 22 about a central
 30  vertical axis 27 of the pedestal 21. In addition, the boom 22 is pivotally mounted to
     the swing-circle assembly 26 so that a pair of 12 inch (30.5 centimeter) diameter
     hydraulic cylinders 28 may erect the boom 22 to a desired angle of inclination. For
     example, at a zero angle of inclination, the boom 22 is horizontal and provides a

     fashion, the jib 37 is positioned over a first location to pick up the payload 24, and
     then positioned over a second location to drop off the payload.
              [00043]    The swing-circle assembly 26 also carries an operator's cab 29, a
  5  diesel engine 30, and a hydraulic pump 31 driven by the diesel engine. The hydraulic
     pump 31 powers the swing-circle assembly 26, the hydraulic cylinders 28, the hoist
     mechanism 25, and an auxiliary hoist mechanism 39.
              [00044]    In the crane 20, the hoist rope 23 is a main hoist wire rope, and the
     hoist mechanism 25 is a main hoist winch. A live end of the main hoist wire rope 23
 10  is secured to the main hoist winch 25, which draws in the main hoist wire rope 23 to
     lift the payload 24.    A dead end 32 of the main hoist wire rope 23 is secured to the
     boom 22. A hoist block 33 carrying the main hook 34 attaches the main hoist wire
     rope 23 to the payload 24. For example, the hoist block 33 provides a maximum lift
     of 25 short tons (22.7 metric tons). The main hoist wire rope 23 runs over a boom
 15  point sheave assembly 35 and over a sheave assembly 36 in a jib 37 extending from
     the boom 22.     The combination of the sheave assembly 36 and the hoist block 33
     organizes the main hoist wire rope 23 into a four part reeving so that the tension on
     the main hoist wire rope 23 is about one-quarter of the tension applied on the main
     hook 34 from the payload 24.
20            [00045]    The crane 20 also has an auxiliary hoist wire rope 38. A live end
     of the auxiliary hoist wire rope 38 is secured to an auxiliary hoist winch 39 mounted
     to the boom 22.      A dead end of the auxiliary hoist wire rope 38 is secured to an
     overhaul ball 40. The auxiliary hoist wire rope 38 runs over the boom point sheave
     assembly 35 and over a sheave 41 at the distal end of the jib 37.
25            [00046]    FIG. 2 shows a second kind of offshore crane 50 that also is
     susceptible to heave loads when performing an off-board lift. In general, the crane 50
     has a base 51, a boom 52 mounted to the base 51, a hoist rope 53 descending from the
     boom for attachment to a payload 54, and a hoist mechanism 55 mounted to the base
     51 for applying tension to the hoist rope 53 to lift the payload 54.
 30           [00047]    In particular, the crane 50 is a pedestal-mounted offshore crane
     having a lattice-frame boom 52.          A specific example of such a crane is a
     NAUTILUS@ brand of pedestal marine crane Model 1400L.5-170 sold by Oil States
     Industries, Inc. of Arlington, Texas. The lattice frame of the boom 52 is efficient for

     the large size of the crane 50. The base 51 is a cylindrical pedestal, and the boom 52
     is mounted to the pedestal via a swing-circle assembly 56. The swing circle assembly
     56 rotates the boom 52 about a central vertical axis 57 of the pedestal 51. In addition,
     a heel pin 58 pivotally mounts the boom 52 to the swing-circle assembly 56 so that a
  5  boom hoist winch 59 may erect the boom 52 to a desired angle of inclination. For
     example, at a zero angle of inclination, the boom 52 is horizontal and provides a
     radius of 177 feet (54 meters) from the pedestal axis 57 to a main hook 68. The boom
     hoist winch 59 reels in a boom hoist wire rope 60 to raise the boom 52.           In this
     fashion, ajib 61 extending from the boom 52 is positioned over a first location to pick
 10  up the payload 54, and then positioned over a second location to drop off the payload.
              [00048]    The swing-circle assembly 56 also carries an operator's cab 62, a
     diesel engine 63, and a hydraulic pump 64 driven by the diesel engine. The hydraulic
     pump 64 powers the swing-circle assembly 56, the hoist mechanism 55, the boom
     host winch 59, and an auxiliary hoist mechanism 65.
 15           [00049]    In the crane 50, the hoist rope 53 is a main hoist wire rope, and the
     hoist mechanism 55 is a main hoist winch. A live end of the main hoist wire rope 53
     is secured to the main hoist winch 55, which draws in the main hoist wire rope 53 to
     lift the payload 54.    A dead end 66 of the main hoist wire rope 53 is secured to the
     boom 52. A hoist block 67 carrying the main hook 68 attaches the main hoist wire
20   rope 53 to the payload 54. For example, the hoist block 67 provides a maximum lift
     of 50 short tons (45.4 metric tons). The main hoist wire rope 53 runs over a boom
     point sheave assembly 69 and over a sheave assembly 70. The combination of the
     sheave assembly 70 and the hoist block 67 organizes the main hoist wire rope 53 into
     a four part reeving so that the tension on the main hoist wire rope 53 is about one
25   quarter of the tension applied on the main hook 68 from the payload 54.
              [00050]    The crane 50 also has an auxiliary hoist wire rope 71. A live end
     of the auxiliary hoist wire rope 71 is secured to an auxiliary hoist winch 65 mounted
     to the base 51.     A dead end of the auxiliary hoist wire rope 71 is secured to an
     overhaul ball 72. The auxiliary hoist wire rope 71 runs over the boom point sheave
 30  assembly 69 and over a sheave 73 at the distal end of the jib 61.
              [00051]    It is desired to use an elastomeric load compensator for load
     compensation of a crane, such as a crane of the kind shown in FIG. 1 or FIG. 2. The
     load compensator may handle the (sometimes very high) liftoff velocity required to

WO 2015/136488                                                           PCT/IB2015/051827

     avoid payload re-contact with the deck of the floating vessel, as well as provide
     compensation for deck heave.       The re-contact scenario involves the deck moving
     down at the moment the payload is picked up off the deck. The payload then has a
     certain amount of time to get out of the way before the deck comes back and hits it.
  5  This time allowance dictates a hoisting velocity. The elastomeric load compensator
     of the present disclosure has been designed to resist the "impact" from the upward
     moving hook meeting the downward-moving payload, rather than typical heave
     applications, where load re-contact is not such a concern.
              [00052]    The heave compensation reduces the crane stiffness and reduces
 10  the Dynamic Factor (Cv) in such a way as to significantly increase the off-board crane
     load ratings for a given crane model. In most cases, this allows for the use of a
     smaller crane model for a given customer or project requirement. The smaller crane
     model has lower design requirements for the crane support structure, which is a
     significant consideration in the platform design for the customer. This reduces the
 15  platform construction costs for the customer.
              [00053]    An elastomeric load compensator is a compact, convenient,
     reliable, and relatively lightweight mechanism for load compensation in comparison
     to the mechanical spring, counterweight, and hydraulic mechanisms that have been
     used for crane heave compensation.       The elastomeric load compensator described
20   below is configured for placement at various locations on the crane, and may provide
     a rather linear spring rate and shock and vibration absorption as appropriate for the
     particular location of the load compensator.
              [00054]    The elastomeric load compensator can be added when needed to an
     existing offshore crane already installed on an offshore platform, or it can be added in
25   anticipation of occurrences when it would be needed, or it can be added when an
     offshore crane is installed on an offshore platform, or it can be added on-shore to
     crane components when the crane components are manufactured.
              [00055]    FIG. 3 shows an elastomeric load compensator 80 configured for
     quick mounting and dismounting from an offshore crane. In the example of FIG. 2,
 30  the elastomeric load compensator 80 has been mounted to the crane 20 of FIG. 1,
     although the elastomeric load compensator can be mounted just as easily in the same
     way to different kinds of cranes, such as the crane 50 in FIG. 2.

WO 2015/136488                                                            PCT/IB2015/051827

              [00056]    As shown in FIG. 3, the dead end 32 of the main hoist wire rope 23
     has been removed from a load cell mount 81 on the underside of the boom 22 and
     attached to a first steel eyelet 82 of the elastomeric load compensator 80. A link 83
     has been added to attach a second steel eyelet 84 of the elastomeric load compensator
  5  80 to the load cell mount 81.      Therefore tension in the main hoist wire rope 23 is
     applied to the elastomeric load compensator 80, and the elastomeric load compensator
     reacts to the applied tension by elongating so that the distance between the first eyelet
     82 and the second eyelet 84 increases in proportion to the applied tension.         This
     elongation in proportion to the applied tension tends to keep the tension in the main
 10  hoist wire rope 23 more constant when heave loads are applied. The overall effect of
     the elastomeric load compensator 80 is to provide passive heave compensation by
     reducing the crane stiffness from the main hook 34 through the pedestal structure.
              [00057]    For example, the elastomeric load compensator 80 has a spring rate
     of 892 pounds force per inch (1.52 kilo Newtons/cm), a maximum extension of about
 15  20 inches (51 cm) for a maximum rated tension of about 17.4 kips (77.4 kilo
     Newtons), an outer diameter of about 14 inches (36 cm), and a length of about 56
     inches (142 cm) in the absence of applied tension. It should be clear to anyone with
     reasonable skills in the art that other design requirements than those listed in the
     previous example may be accommodated by changing the number of elastic springs in
20   each spring assembly, the number of spring assemblies, the dimensions of the elastic
     springs in one or more assemblies, or the elastomeric material of the elastic springs.
     For example, one could double the spring rate of the elastomeric load compensator of
     the previous example and cut in half its maximum extension by using only one elastic
     spring assembly of the same characteristics as each one of the two assemblies
25   assumed used in the example. In like fashion, one could reduce the spring rate to, say,
     two thirds that of the elastomeric load compensator in the example, and increase its
     maximum extension to one hundred and fifty percent, by connecting to it a third
     elastomeric spring assembly in series.
               [00058]   FIG. 4 shows a more permanent mounting of the elastomeric load
 30  compensator 80 to the boom 22. A bracket 91 is welded or bolted to the underside of
     the boom 22, and the second eyelet 84 of the elastomeric load compensator 80 is
     pinned to the bracket 91. An idler sheave 92 is secured to the underside of the boom
     22 at the original attachment location (in FIG. 3) of the dead end 32 of the main hoist

WO 2015/136488                                                            PCT/IB2015/051827

     wire rope 23. The main hoist wire rope 23 is strung over the idler sheave 92, and
     again the dead end 32 of the main hoist wire rope 23 is attached to the first eyelet 82
     of the elastomeric load compensator 80.
             [00059]    The assembly in FIG. 4 has a number of advantages over the
  5  configuration in FIG. 3. In FIG. 4, the elastomeric load compensator 80 is mounted at
     a smaller radius from the pedestal axis (27 in FIG. 1) so that maximum static load of
     the crane is reduced less by the weight of the elastomeric load compensator 80. In
     FIG. 4, the length of the elastomeric load compensator 80 does not reduce the
     appropriate minimum distance of the hook 34 from the jib 37. In addition, the amount
 10  of space between the first mounting eyelet 82 and the sheave 92 provides a visual
     indication to persons near the crane of available capacity of the elastomeric load
     compensator for absorbing heave loads.
             [00060]    FIG. 5 shows an alternative way of using the elastomeric load
     compensator 80 mounted under the boom 22. In this example, the sheave 92 of FIG.
 15  4 has been eliminated.    Instead, the main hoist wire rope 23 loops back over the
     sheave assembly 36, and from the sheave assembly 36, the dead-end 32 of the main
     hoist wire rope is attached to the first eyelet 82 of the elastomeric load compensator
     80.
             [00061]    The different ways of using the elastomeric load compensator 80 as
20   shown in FIGS. 3, 4, and 5 all have the device in line with a single part of main hoist
     wire rope 23.    This is in contrast to a load compensator that would be inserted
     between the hook 34 and a payload.       The in-line mounting as shown in FIGS. 3, 4,
     and 5 is more convenient for customers, and is more challenging to implement with a
     conventional load compensator such as one using a gas cylinder.             The in-line
25   mounting does not leave a device hanging in the way of the people trying to rig the
     load to the crane hook. The in-line mounting does not limit the hook drop height of
     the crane. In-line mounting is more challenging for non-elastomeric devices because
     in-line mounting requires much more flexibility than hook mounting because the in
     line mounting has more mechanical advantage since it acts on fewer parts of line.
 30  Due to the mechanical advantage, less required force is put on the load compensator,
     but the load compensator provides more travel or displacement.
             [00062]    Gas cylinders do not deal well with large displacements because
     their force versus displacement response is not linear. This is due to the fact that

     adiabatic but non-reversible gas cylinder expansion/compression follows a polytropic
     pressure vs. volume curve: P1V1" = P 2V 2", where V=Area*Length.                 Thus P 2  =
     P1(V1/V2)"= P 1 (L 1 /L 2)", where L 2 is actually Li + displacement. The exponent n is a
     number somewhere between 1.1 and 2.             Therefore this results in a non-linear force
  5  response. In comparison, the elastomer response for elongation is much more linear.
     Because a gas cylinder does not have linear force vs. displacement, it is much more
     difficult for the manufacturer to create an inline device with ratings that conform to
     the API 2C standard, because the standard only accounts for linear (spring-like)
     behavior in the official formula for Cv.         Cv = 1 + Vr Sqrt[k/g/SWLH] - k is the
 10  effective composite vertical stiffness of everything between the payload and the earth.
     The standard has no concept of the non-linear response of the gas-cylinder type
     devices.
              [00063]    FIGS. 6, 7, 8, and 9 show further details of the elastomeric load
     compensator 80.       The elastomeric load compensator 80 includes a pair of in-line
 15  tension spring assemblies 96, 97 mechanically connected in series so that tension
     from the load is applied to each of the tension spring assemblies and the load
     compensator provides an elongation to the load that includes a sum of elongations
     from each of the tension spring assemblies. The tension spring assemblies 96, 97 are
     enclosed and stacked in-line with each other in a common tubular housing 101.           The
20   housing 101 is comprised of a steel tube 101 and first and second steel caps 102, 103
     secured to the tube 101 at opposite ends of the tube. For example, the ends of the tube
     101 are threaded, and the caps 102, 103 screw on to the tube 101, and set screws 104,
      105, 106, 107 prevent the caps from unscrewing from the tube 101. The tube 101 has
     longitudinal slots 108, 109 spaced about its circumference in order to reduce the
25   weight of the tube and to permit visual inspection of the elongation and condition of
     tension elements in the tension spring assemblies 96, 97.
              [00064]    A steel extension 110 protrudes from the housing 100 through the
     first cap 102 when tension is applied to the two eyelets 82, 84. The first eyelet 82 is
     disposed on the exposed end of extension 110, and the second eyelet 84 is disposed on
 30  the second cap 103.       For example, the eyelets 82, 84 are made from steel plate, and
     welded to the extension 110 and the second cap 103, respectively. Inside the housing
      100, the other end of the extension 110 is mechanically connected to the first tension
     spring assembly 96, the first spring assembly 96 is mechanically connected to the

     second tension spring assembly 97, and the second tension spring assembly 97 is
     mechanically connected to the housing 101.       Tension applied to the eyelets 82, 84
     pulls the exposed end of the extension 110 outwardly from the housing 100, elongates
     each of the tension spring assemblies 96, 97, and translates the entire first tension
  5  spring assembly 96 in a longitudinal direction with respect to the tube 101 toward the
     first cap 102 and away from the second cap 103.
               [00065]   Each tension spring assembly 96, 97 includes a multiplicity of
     tension springs mechanically connected in parallel with each other.          Therefore
     elongation of the tension spring assembly is applied to each of the tension springs in
 10  the tension spring assembly, and the tension springs in the tension spring assembly
     provide a restoring force upon the load that is the sum of restoring forces from the
     tension springs in the tension spring assembly.     The parallel connection of multiple
     tension springs provides redundancy and enables load compensators of various sizes
     and load capacities to be constructed using multiple instances of one tension spring
 15  component.      In a preferred construction, the tension springs are instances of an
     elastomeric tension element.
              [00066]    A single elastomeric tension element 120 is shown in FIGS. 10, 11,
     and 12. The elastomeric tension element 120 is elongated and can be cylindrical or
     prismatic, depending on specific needs of cross section, flexibility, or means of
20   attachment. For example, the elastomeric tension element 120 shown in FIGS. 10, 11,
     and 12 is cylindrical.     The elastomeric tension element 120 is comprised of an
     elongated elastomer body 121 and metal, composite or plastic end caps 122 and 123.
     Each end cap 122, 123 has a respective cavity filled with elastomer of the body so that
     the end cap is bonded to the elastomer of the body.
25            [00067]    The elastomeric tension element 120 is made by an injection
     molding process in which the internal surfaces of the end caps are coated with an
     epoxy rubber-to-metal or composite bonding agent, the end caps are inserted into ends
     of a mold having a conforming cavity, elastomer mixed with a vulcanizing agent is
     injected into the mold, and the elastomer is cured under heat and pressure.        The
 30  elastomer, for example, is natural or nitrile butadiene rubber, and the vulcanizing
     agent is sulfur. A suitable metal-to-rubber bonding agent, for example, is Chemlock

      123 are configured for attachment with supporting plates, rings or rails, for example
  5  the end caps 122, 123 are provided with peripheral grooves 124, 125, 126, 127

 10  the slotted plate 130 to an eyelet, extension, or another slotted plate of a neighboring
     tension spring assembly.
              [00069]     For example, as shown in FIG. 14, a pair of elastomeric tension
     elements 120, 142 have been received in the slotted plate 130. A second slotted steel
     plate 143 in the shape of a disk is aligned in a coaxial fashion with the first slotted
 15  plate 130 to receive opposite end caps of the elastomeric tension elements 120, 142.
     Therefore the elastomeric tension elements 120, 142 become extended when tension
     is applied to the slotted plates 130, 143 in the axial direction to pull the two slotted
     plates away from each other. In effect, the elastomeric tension elements 120, 142 are
     mechanically connected in parallel to the pair of slotted plates 130, 143, so that the
20   elastomeric tension elements share the same displacement.
              [00070] In practice, as shown in FIG. 15, a respective elastomeric extension
     element is received in each slot of the slotted plate 130 so that the slotted plate carries
     a circular array of elastomeric extension elements. In this example, the elastomeric
     tension elements are retained in the slotted plate 130 by a flat ring 143 fastened to the
25   slotted plate.
              [00071]     FIG. 16 shows a lateral cross-section of the elastomeric load
     compensator 80 for case of no tension applied to the elastomeric load compensator.
     FIG. 17 shows a similar cross-section for the case of maximum tension applied to the
     elastomeric load compensator 80. In the elastomeric load compensator 80, the first
 30  tension spring assembly 96 includes a first pair of slotted steel plates 151, 152
     carrying a first circular array 153 of elastomeric tension elements. The second tension
     spring assembly 97 includes a second pair of slotted steel plates 154, 155 carrying a
     second circular array 156 of elastomeric tension elements.

              [00072]    The two tension spring assemblies         96, 97 are mechanically
     connected in series to reduce the stiffness of the elastomeric load compensator 80 and
     increase the maximum displacement of the elastomeric load compensator 80 without
     increasing the lengths of the elastomeric tension elements 153, 156. A steel spacer
  5  plate 157 is disposed between the slotted plates 152, 154 to provide clearance between
     the caps of the elastomeric tension elements of the first array 153 and the elastomeric
     tension elements of the second array 156. Bolts 158 are inserted between the slotted
     plates 152, 154 and the spacer plate 157 to fasten the slotted plates 152, 154 together.
     Alternatively, to eliminate the use of bolts 158, and spacer plate 157, and thus
 10  simplify assembly, a single, thicker slotted plate can be used instead of the two slotted
     plates   152 and 154, as the means of connecting adjacent elastomeric spring
     assemblies.
              [00073]    The tension spring assembly 96 slides against the inner surface of
     the tube 101 of the tubular housing 100 when the tension spring assembly 96
 15  elongates as tension from a load is applied to the tension spring assembly 96. The
     tubular housing 100 has a fixed length greater than the length of the two tension
     spring assemblies 96, 97 when the two tension spring assemblies have a maximum
     elongation under a maximum amount of tension from the applied load so that the
     tension spring assemblies are contained within the tubular housing 100 under the
20   maximum amount of tension from the applied load. Moreover, the first cap 102 of the
     housing 100 limits elongation of the two tension spring assemblies 96, 97 when a load
     in excess of a maximum amount of tension is applied the two tension assemblies so
     that the two tension spring assemblies are contained within the tubular housing when
     a load in excess of the maximum amount of tension is applied to the two tension
25   spring assemblies.    In this case of a load in excess of the maximum rated load, the
     slotted plate 151 moves a bit further than that shown in FIG. 16 to abut against the
     first cap 102 of the housing, so that tension from the load in excess of the maximum
     rated load is applied to the tube 101 of the housing 100.
              [00074]    Steel fins 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, etc. are secured to the
 30  slotted plates 151, 152, 154 and these fins reinforce the slotted plates and help to align
     the slotted plates with the tube 101 during assembly.         For example, the fins are
     welded to the slotted plates. Similar fins 167, 168, etc. are also secured to the slotted
     plate 155 in order to reinforce the slotted plate 155 and help align the slotted plate 155

WO 2015/136488                                                            PCT/IB2015/051827
                                                 16
     during assembly.     In contrast to the slotted plates 151, 152, 154, which have a
     clearance fit with the tube 101, the slotted plate 155 has a diameter substantially
     greater than the inner diameter of the tube 101.
              [00075]    Another way of keeping the slotted plates 151, 152, 154, aligned
  5  with the tube 101 would be to use one or more guide rods that would pass through
     bushings mounted to one or more the slotted plates 151, 152. 154. Each guide rod
     would be perpendicular to the slotted plates 151. 152. 154 and parallel to the axis 190
     of the tube 101. For example, each guide rod could be mounted to the slotted plate
     155 and could extend from the slotted plate 155 to the cap 102, and each guide rod
 10  could pass through a respective bushing mounted to each of the slotted plates 151,
      152, 154. For example, one guide rod could be used that would be aligned coaxial
     with the axis 190 of the tube 101. In another arrangement, a plurality of guide rods
     could be equally spaced around a circle centered on the axis 190. For example the
     plurality of guide rods could be at a radius from the axis 190 of about one half to three
 15  quarters of the radius of the tube 101.
              [00076]    The extension 110 is comprised of a steel tube 181, a steel plug 182
     carrying the first eyelet 82, and a steel ring 183. For example, the plug 182 and the
     ring 183 are welded to the tube 181, and studs 184 are embedded in the ring 183 for
     fastening the slotted plate 151 to the extension 110.
20            [00077]    For some applications, the extension 110 could be omitted, and the
     first eyelet 82 could be fastened directly to the slotted platel5l.   For example, this
     could be done in a configuration in which a wire rope would extend from the housing
      100 along the longitudinal axis of the housing.
              [00078]    As shown in FIG. 17, under maximum rated tension, the slotted
25   plate 151 reaches an annular crush pad 185 seated in the first cap 102 of the housing
     100.   The crush pad 185 provides a permanent record of whether or not the threshold
     of maximum rated tension has been exceeded.         For example, the crush pad 185 is
     made of hard plastic foam, and the crush pad is bonded with adhesive to the first cap
     102. The amount of any tension in excess of the maximum rated tension is indicated
 30  by a permanent reduction in the thickness of the crush pad 185 along the longitudinal
     axis 190 of the housing 100.
              [00079]    As shown in FIG. 21, the slotted plate 155 is captured in an annular
     seat 186 machined into the neighboring end of the tube 101, and held in this annular

WO 2015/136488                                                            PCT/IB2015/051827
                                                 17
     seat by contact with the second cap 103 of the housing.          The second cap 103 is
     secured to the tube 101 by stub ACME threads 187 on the inner circumference of the
     second cap and on the outer circumference of the neighboring end of the tube 101. A
     set screw 188 keeps the second cap 103 from unscrewing from the tube 101.
  5           [00080]    During assembly, the slotted plate 151 is fastened to the extension
      181 before the elastomeric tension elements 96 are assembled onto the slotted plate.
     Also, the slotted plates 152, 154 and the spacer plate 157 are fastened together before
     the elastomeric tension elements 96, 97 are assembled onto the slotted plates 152,
     154.    After the elastomeric tension elements 96, 97 are assembled into the slotted
 10  plates 151, 152, 154, 155, the stacked tension spring assemblies 96, 97 are slipped
     into the tube 101.     For example, the spring assembles 96, 97 are assembled in an
     upright orientation, as shown in FIG. 16, and the first cap 102 carrying the crush pad
      185 is screwed onto the tube 101, and then the stacked tension spring assemblies 96,
     97 and the extension 181 are lowered into the tube until the slotted plate 155 becomes
 15  seated in the upper end of the tube.     Then the second cap 103 is screwed onto the
     upper end of the tube, and finally the set screws are tightened.
              [00081]    It should be apparent that load compensator 80 as shown in the
     drawing figures could be modified in various ways to accommodate different loads or
     mounting arrangements.      For example, the length of the tube 101 could be increased
20   to accommodate three or more instances of the tension spring assembly 96, 97. For
     example, a third tension spring assembly could be bolted between the first spring
     assembly 96 and the second spring assembly 97 using an additional instance of the
     spacer plate or disk 157.     For example, instead of using the second eyelet 84 to
     mechanically connect the load compensator 80 to the boom of a crane, the tube 101
25   could be mechanically connected directly to the boom by brackets welded to the tube
     and bolted or welded to the boom.
              [00082]    For example, FIG. 22 shows a load compensator 190 that is similar
     to the load compensator 80 described above but has two eyelets 191, 192 for
     mounting the load compensator to the boom 22 in such a way that the load
 30  compensator is kept parallel to the boom. In this example, the two eyelets 191, 192
     are pinned to respective brackets 193 and 194 bolted or welded to the boom 22 of the
     crane of FIG. 1.

WO 2015/136488                                                            PCT/IB2015/051827
                                                 18
              [00083]   As further shown in FIG. 22, the load compensator 190 differs
     from the load compensator 80 described above because the eyelets 191, 192 have
     been welded to the top of the tube 101 at the ends of the tube 101.       Also the load
     compensator 190 has a second end cap 195 that does not have an eyelet welded to it.
  5            [00084]  FIGS. 24, 25, and 26 show views of a shortened load compensator
     200 that is similar to the load compensator 80 described above. The shortened load
     compensator 200 differs from the load compensator 80 because the tension spring
     assembly 96 has been omitted from the shortened load compensator 200 and the
     housing 205 and the extension 202 have been shortened by the length that the omitted
 10  tension spring assembly 96 has under the maximum tension load. The housing 205
     has been shortened by substituting a shorter tube 201 of the housing. The extension
     202 has been shortened by substituting a shorter tube 203 of the extension.         The
     extension 202 is bolted to the slotted plate 154 of the tension spring assembly 97.
     Under the maximum load, as shown in FIG. 26, the slotted plate 154 abuts against the
 15  foam crush pad 185. Otherwise, the shortened load compensator 200 is constructed
     and operates in the same way as the load compensator 80 described above. The stroke
     of the extension 202 under the maximum tension is reduced by half, and the stiffness
     of the shortened load compensator 200 is twice the stiffness of the load compensator
     80, because the shortened load compensator has a single tension spring assembly 96
20   contained within the housing 205 instead of two similar tension spring assemblies.
              [00085]   Although the above description has focused on load compensators
     for load compensation of cranes, it should be apparent that the load compensators
     described above also may be used as a substitute for conventional mechanical springs
     or hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders that act as springs in a variety of applications.
25   The load compensators may be added to an existing active or passive load
     compensation system in order to reduce stiffness or enhance the load compensation of
     the existing load compensation system.          For example, a load compensator as
     described above may be used not only in-line with a tensioned cable or wire rope, but
     also with a flying or sliding sheave, or with a nodding boom, or with a winch mounted
 30  on rails. These various ways of coupling a load compensator to a load may be used in
     the same structure for coupling multiple load compensators to the same load. For
     example, these various ways can be used in the same offshore crane, as further
     described in Walter Billiot et al., U.S. Patent Application Ser. 14/207,118 filed March

              [00086]    Numerous examples are provided herein to enhance understanding
  5  of the present disclosure. A specific set of examples are provided as follows.
              [00087]    In a first example, there is disclosed a load compensator

     tension from the load is applied to each of the tension spring assemblies and the load
 10  compensator provides an elongation to the load that includes a sum of elongations
     from each of the tension spring assemblies, and the tension spring assemblies are
     stacked in-line with each other in the tubular housing.
              [00088]    In a second example, there is disclosed a load compensator
     according to the preceding first example, wherein at least one of said at least two
 15  tension spring assemblies slides against an inner surface of the tubular housing when

     under the maximum amount of tension from the applied load.
 10           [00091]    In a fifth example, there is disclosed a load compensator according
     to the preceding fourth example, wherein the tubular housing is configured to limit

     one tension spring assembly.
              [00092]    In a sixth example, there is disclosed a load compensator according
     to any of the preceding examples first to fifth, wherein each tension spring assembly
     includes a multiplicity of tension springs mechanically connected in parallel so that
20   elongation of said each tension spring assembly is applied to each of the multiplicity
     of tension springs in said each tension spring assembly, and the multiplicity of tension
     springs in said each tension spring assembly provide a restoring force upon the load
     that is a sum of restoring forces from the multiplicity of tension springs in said each
     tension spring assembly.

 30  tension springs includes an elongated body of elastomer.
              [00095]    In a ninth example, there is disclosed a load compensator according

     to the preceding ninth example, wherein said each tension spring assembly includes a
     peripheral array of fins mounted to the first disk and adjacent to an interior surface of
 10  the tubular housing for keeping the first disk perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of
     the tubular housing while the first disk slides with respect to the tubular housing in
     response to the applied tension from the load.

     assemblies, and a second eyelet mounted to the tubular housing, and wherein a second

              [000106]   In view of the above, there has been described a load compensator
     including one or more tension spring assemblies that are contained within a tubular
 30  housing when tension from a load is applied to the tension spring assemblies. In a
     preferred construction, the tension springs in each tension spring assembly are
     elastomeric tension elements. When the load compensator includes more than one
     tension spring assembly, the tension spring assemblies are mechanically connected to

WO 2015/136488                                                          PCT/IB2015/051827
                                                23
     each other in series and stacked in-line with each other in a common tubular housing,
     so that tension from the load is applied to each tension spring assembly and the load
     compensator provides an elongation to the load that includes the sum of elongations
     from each of the tension spring assemblies, and a total stiffness whose reciprocal is
  5  the sum of the reciprocals of the individual stiffnesses of the tension spring
     assemblies.    In a preferred construction, each of the tension spring assemblies
     includes elastomeric tension elements mounted between two disks, and the tubular
     housing includes a tube and caps attached to the ends of the tube.           The load
     compensator is a compact, convenient, reliable, and relatively lightweight mechanism
 10  for load compensation in comparison to the mechanical spring, counterweight, and
     hydraulic mechanisms that have been used for crane heave compensation.            The
     components of the load compensator have been designed so that a variety of load
     compensators of different sizes and aspect ratios can be assembled easily using many
     instances of the same component parts.       Therefore many of the same parts can be
 15  used to assemble load compensators not only for different sizes and kinds of cranes,
     but also for a wide range of applications other than load compensation of cranes.
