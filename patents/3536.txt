   Field of the Invention
 5 The present invention relates to a gaming system and to a
   method of gaming.
   Background of the Invention
10 It is known to provide a gaming system which comprises a
   game controller arranged to randomly display several
   symbols from a predetermined set of symbols and to
   determine a game outcome such as a game win based on the
   displayed symbols.                    Such gaming systems may commonly be
15 implemented as a stepper machine provided with reels with
   each reel carrying several symbols of the set, or a video
   machine wherein selected symbols are displayed on virtual
   reels on a graphical display device.
20 In a conventional gaming system, the reels are generally
   spun and controlled so that the reels stop in a sequence
   commencing with a leftmost reel and ending with a
   rightmost reel.                    With such a gaming system, the rightmost
   reel will typically spin 3 or more revolutions more than
25 the leftmost reel.                    This process is desirable for some
   games, but for games with a large number of free spins,
   this can be very time consuming and tedious for a player.
   Summary of the                   Invention

   a gaming system showing symbols displayed in a display
   area after selection of symbols during implementation of a
15 game.
   Description of an Embodiment of the Invention
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a schematic
20 block diagram of a gaming system 10 arranged to implement
   a probabilistic game, in this example of the type wherein
   several symbols from a set of symbols are randomly
   displayed, and a game outcome is determined on the basis
   of the displayed symbols.               With some such probabilistic
25 games, the set of symbols include standard symbols and
   function symbols, and the game outcome is determined on
   the basis of the displayed standard symbols and the
   function associated with any displayed function symbol.
   For example, standard symbols may resemble fruit such as
30 apples, pears and bananas with a win outcome being
   determined when a predetermined number of the same fruit
   appear on a display in the same win line, scattered, and
   so on.               The function associated with a function symbol may
   be for example a wild function wherein display of the
35 function symbol is treated during consideration of the
   game outcome as any of the standard symbols.               A function
   symbol may be represented as the word "WILD", a star, or
   10456775_1 (GHMaers) P84465.AU.3

                                                6
   by any other suitable word or symbol.                  Other functions are
   also envisaged such as scatter functions, multiplier
   functions, repeat win functions, jackpot functions and
   feature commencement functions.                  The available win lines
 5 may be fixed, may be determined on the basis of the bet
   placed, or may be selectable by a player.
   This type of game often also comprises a base game mode
   and a special game mode, with special game mode being
10 triggered when a specific trigger condition occurs during
   base game mode.                  For example, base game mode may implement
   a base game wherein a plurality of symbols are selected
   for use in determining game outcomes from a set of
   symbols, and special game mode may implement a feature
15 game with the feature game being triggered when a
   particular symbol or combination of symbols is displayed.
   In a conventional gaming system having a plurality of
   spinnable symbol bearing reels, the reels are generally
20 spun and controlled so that the reels stop in a sequence
   commencing with a leftmost reel and ending with a
   rightmost reel.                  In one such gaming system, all reels
   initially spin in a downward direction, and after at least
   one complete reel revolution the leftmost first reel
25 stops.              After at least one more revolution, the next reel
   to the right, the second reel, stops, and similarly after
   a further revolution, the next reel to the right, the
   third reel, stops, and so on.                  In a gaming system having 3
   reels, the third reel will spin typically 3 or more
30 revolutions more than the first reel.                  This process is
   generally desirable for base games, but for games with a
   large number of free spins, this can be very time
   consuming and tedious for a player.
35 The present gaming system operates such that, at least
   during a portion of a game implemented by the gaming
   system, a player is provided with the option of either
   10456775_1 (GHMaers) P84465.AU.3

                                                 7
   controlling the reels so that the reels stop in a
   conventional manner, that is progressively left to right,
   or so that the reels stop simultaneously, or so that the
   reels stop under control of the player progressively from
 5 right to left.
   One example of selecting symbols is for a symbol selector
   to select symbols for display by selecting a reel stopping
   position. For this purpose, it is known to use a
10 probability table stored in memory so as to vary the odds
   of a particular stop position being selected. Other
   techniques can be used to control the odds of particular
   outcomes occurring to thereby control the return to player
   of the game.
15
   Referring to Figure 1, a schematic diagram of core
   components of a gaming system 10 is shown.                   The core
   components comprise a player interface 30 and a game
   controller 32.                   The player interface 30 is arranged to
20 enable interaction between a player and the gaming system
   and for this purpose includes input/output components
   required for the player to enter instructions and play the
   game.
25 Components of the player interface 30 may vary but will
   typically include a credit mechanism 34 to enable a player
   to input credits and receive payouts, one or more displays
   36 which may comprise a touch screen, and a game play
   mechanism 38 arranged to enable a player to input game
30 playing instructions.
   The game controller 32 is in data communication with the
   player interface 30 and typically includes a processor 40
   arranged to process game play instructions and output game
35 player outcomes to the display 36.                   Typically, the game
   play instructions are stored as program code in a memory
   42 that can also be hardwired.                   It will be understood that
   10456775_1 (GHMaers) P84465.AU.3

                                                   8
   in this specification the term "processor" is used to
   refer generically to any device that can process game play
   instructions and may include a microprocessor,
   microcontroller, programmable logic device or any
 5 computational device such as a personal computer or a
   server.
   A functional diagram illustrating operative components of
   the game controller 32 is shown in Figure 2.
10
   The memory 42 is arranged to store symbols data 14
   indicative of a plurality of symbols                    for use during
   implementation of a base game and optionally during a
   feature game, function data 16 indicative of one or more
15 functions allocatable to the symbols, and game instruction
   data 18 usable by the gaming system 10 to control
   operation of the game.
   The game controller 32 includes a game implementer 20
20 which is arranged to implement a game, including selection
   of several                   symbols from the stored symbols 14 for display
   to a player.                     In this example, the selection of symbols
   carried out by the game implementer 20 is made using a
   random number generator 22.                     The game implementer 20 may
25 also be arranged to select and allocate one or more
   functions to one or more symbols.                     Such functions include
   a wild function, a scatter function, or any other function
   which may be applied to a symbol or to the game.
30 It will be appreciated that the random number generator 22
   may be of a type which is arranged to generate pseudo
   random numbers based on a seed number, and that in this
   specification the term "random" will be understood
   accordingly to mean truly random or pseudo random.
35
   In the present example, the gaming system 10 may be
   arranged to implement a single game, or the gaming system
   10456775_1 (GHMaers) P84465.AU.3

                                                9
   may be operable in normal game mode wherein a base game is
   implemented and special game mode wherein a feature game
   is implemented.                  Special game mode may be arranged to
   commence based on occurrence of a trigger condition.
 5
   The game controller 32 also comprises a reel controller 24
   arranged to control reel positions and reel movement.                  The
   reel controller 24 communicates with a display controller
   26 arranged to control the display 36 and, in response to
10 instructions from the game implementer 20,                 the reel
   controller 24 in association with the display controller
   26 causes the reels to spin and stop either in a
   conventional manner, to stop simultaneously, or to stop
   progressively from right to left.
15
   In this example, the reel controller 24 is arranged to
   implement a reel stopping regime based on whether a player
   input is received and the type of player input received.
   For example, in one embodiment, if no player input is
20 received during a defined period whilst the reels are
   spinning, the reel controller 24 may be arranged to cause
   the reels to stop in a conventional manner progressively
   from left to right; if a first player input is received,
   for example by pressing a first game control button 27a,
25 the reel controller 24 may be arranged to cause the reels
   to stop simultaneously; and if a second player input is
   received, for example by pressing a second game control
   button 27b, the reel controller 24 may be arranged to
   cause the reels to stop progressively from right to left.
30 In one variation, the game controller 24 may be arranged
   to cause the rightmost spinning reel to stop each time the
   second game control button 27b is pressed so that the
   player has a degree of control over the timing of the
   right to left stopping sequence.                  With this variation,
35 after the second game control button 27b has been pressed
   and the rightmost reel caused to stop, the game controller
   24 may be arranged to stop the next rightmost spinning
   10456775_1 (GHMaers) P84465.AU.3

                                       10
   reel automatically if the second game control button 27b
   is not pressed by the player within a defined period.
   The game controller 32 also comprises an outcome evaluator
 5 28 which in accordance with the game instructions 18
   determines game outcomes, in this example based on the
   symbols selected for display to a player by the symbol
   selector 20, and a prize allocator 29 arranged to allocate
   prizes based on the game outcomes.
10
   In the embodiments described below, the game implementer
   20,        the reel controller 24, and the outcome evaluator 28
   are at least partly implemented using the processor 40 and
   associated software, although it will be understood that
15 other implementations are envisaged.
   The gaming system 10 can take a number of different forms.
   In a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
20 wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
25 the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
30 gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to play audible
35 and/or display visible gaming information to the player
   and receive gaming inputs from the player.
   10456775_1 (GHMaers) P84465.AU.3

                                                   11
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.                     For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
 5 gaming server are selectively modifiable.                      For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
10 skilled in the art.
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 50 is illustrated in Figure 3. The gaming machine
   50 includes a console 52 having a display 54 on which is
15 displayed representations of a game 56 that can be played
   by a player.                     A mid-trim 60 of the gaming machine 50
   houses a bank of buttons 62, including the first and
   second player game control buttons 27a, 27b, for enabling
   a player to interact with the gaming machine, in
20 particular during gameplay.                      The mid-trim 60 also houses a
   credit input mechanism 64 which in this example includes a
   coin input chute 64A and a bill collector 64B.                      Other
   credit input mechanisms may also be employed, for example,
   a card reader for reading a smart card, debit card or
25 credit card.
   A top box 66 may carry artwork 68,                     including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.                      Further
30 artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 69 of the console 52.                      A coin tray 70 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 69 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 50.
35 The display 54 is in the form of a video display unit,
   particularly a cathode ray tube screen device.
   Alternatively, the display 54 may be a liquid crystal
   10456775_1 (GHMaers) P84465.AU.3

                                                  12
   display, plasma screen, or any other suitable video
   display unit.                    The top box 66 may also include a display,
   for example a video display unit, which may be of the same
   type as the display 54, or of a different type.
 5
   The display 54 in this example is arranged to display
   representations of several reels, each reel of which has
   several associated symbols.                     Typically 3, 4 or 5 reels are
   provided.                   During operation of the game, the reels   first
10 appear to spin then stop with typically three symbols
   visible on each reel.
   A player marketing module                    (PMM) 72 having a display 4 is
   connected to the gaming machine 10.                     The main purpose of
15 the PMM 72 is to allow the player to interact with a
   player loyalty system.                    The PMM has a magnetic card reader
   for the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.                     However other
   reading devices may be employed and the player tracking
20 device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device.                    In this example, the PMM 72 is a Sentinel
   III device produced by Aristocrat Technologies Pty Ltd.
25 Figure 4 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine 100 which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine shown in Figure 3.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
30 having a processor 102.                    Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor 102 in accordance with the
   present invention are stored in a memory 103 which is in
   data communication with the processor 102.
35 Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   10456775_1 (GHMaers) P84465.AU.3

                                                    13
   represented by the memory 103.
   Figure 5 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.                      The memory 103 includes RAM
 5 103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                        The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                        The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.                       The mass storage device
10 103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
15 The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output                      (I/0) interface 105  for
   communicating with a player interface 120 of the gaming
   machine 100,                     the player interface 120 having several
20 peripheral devices.                      The input/output interface 105 and/or
   the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
   their own memory for storing associated instructions and
   data for use with the input/output interface or the
   peripheral devices.                      A random number generator module 113
25 generates random numbers for use by the processor 102.
   In the example shown in Figure 4, the peripheral devices
   that communicate with the game controller 101 comprise one
   or more displays 106; a touch screen 107; a bank of
30 buttons 114,                     including the first and second game control
   buttons 27a, 27b; a card and/or ticket reader 108;                       a
   printer 109;                     a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism
   110; and a coin output mechanism 111.                       Additional hardware
   may be included as part of the gaming machine 100,                       or
35 hardware may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation.
   10456775_1 (GHMaers) P84465.AU.3

                                                   14
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
 5 to a central controller, server or database and receive
   data or commands from the central controller, server or
   database.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
10 gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 may be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 6 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
15 alternative embodiment.                     The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network,
   a LAN or a WAN.                     In this example, three banks 203 of two
   gaming machines 202 are connected to the network 201.                     The
   gaming machines 202 provide a player operable interface
20 and may be the same as the gaming machines 40,100 shown in
   Figures 3 and 4, or may have simplified functionality
   depending on the requirements for implementing game play.
   While banks 203 of two gaming machines are illustrated in
   Figure 6, banks of one, three or more gaming machines are
25 also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.                     The displays 204 may, for example, be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
30 The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
35 In a thick client embodiment, a game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   10456775_1 (GHMaers) P84465.AU.3

                                              15
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server 205
   and the gaming machine 202 implement part of the game,
   they collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
 5 and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202               in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to monitor and
   carry out the Jackpot game.
10
   In a variation of the above thick client embodiment, the
   gaming machine 202 may implement the game, with the game
   server 205 functioning merely to serve data indicative of
   a game to the gaming machine 202               for implementation.
15
   With this implementation, a data signal containing a
   computer program usable by the client terminal to
   implement the gaming system may be transferred from the
   game server to the client terminal, for example in
20 response to a request by the client terminal.
   In a thin client embodiment, the game server 205
   implements most or all of the game played by a player
   using a gaming machine 202 and the gaming machine 202
25 essentially provides only the player interface.                 With this
   embodiment, the game server 205 provides the game
   controller. The gaming machine will receive player
   instructions, and pass the instructions to the game server
   which will process them and return game play outcomes to
30 the gaming machine for display.                In a thin client
   embodiment, the gaming machines could be computer
   terminals, e.g. PCs running software that provides a
   player interface operable using standard computer input
   and output components.
35
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming system 200, including for
   10456775_1 (GHMaers) P84465.AU.3

                                    16
   example a gaming floor management server 208 and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.       An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to monitor the
 5 network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks such as a corporate network,
   and/or a wide area network such as the Internet, for
10 example through a firewall 211.
   A loyalty program server 212 may also be provided.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
15 accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.       For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.       For example, the game
20 server 205 could run a random number generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.
   Examples of specific implementations of the gaming system
25 will now be described with reference to Figures 7 and 8.
   Figure 7 shows a flow diagram 250 which illustrates steps
   252 to 272 of a method of gaming implemented by the gaming
   system.
30 The game implemented by the gaming system is of a type
   including multiple spinnable reels, which may be physical
   reels or virtual reels, with each reel having a plurality
   of symbols and optionally one or more function symbols.
   Win outcomes are determined on the basis of the symbols
35 visible when the reels stop rotating, and in this example
   three symbols are displayed on each reel at any time.        A
   win outcome may occur based on display of the same symbol
   10456775_1 (GHMaers) P84465.AU.3

                                              17
   along normal win lines which may extend horizontally,
   diagonally, or in any other predefined continuous line.                  A
   win outcome may also occur based on display of multiple
   scattered symbols at any display location.                 A win outcome
 5 may also occur on the basis of one or more standard
   symbols in combination with at least one function symbol
   having an assigned function.                 For example a function
   symbol may correspond to a wild function, a scatter
   function, a multiply function, a repeat win function, and
10 so on.
   In the present example, 3 reels 302, 304,                306 are provided
   and during a feature game symbols are selected and
   displayed on first 302,               second 304 and third 306 reels
15 respectively in a display area 308.                 In this example, the
   symbols are selected by selecting reel stopping positions
   corresponding to a central display line 310 with the reel
   controller 24 being arranged to cooperate with the display
   controller 26 so as to spin the reels and stop the reels
20 at stop positions such that the selected symbols are shown
   on the central display line 310.
   The reel controller 24 is arranged to cooperate with a
   display controller 26 so as to provide a player with a
25 degree of control over the particular procedure used to
   stop the reels 302,              304,  306, and in particular to control
   stopping times of rightmost reels that, with conventional
   reel stopping schemes, would ordinarily stop last.
30 In the present example, during implementation of a game
   the first, second and third reels 302,                304, 306 spin 254
   and if no game control buttons are pressed by a player
   during a defined period of time the reel controller 24
   causes the reels to stop in a generally conventional
35 manner in a left to right sequence 264.
   10456775_1 (GHMaers) P84465.AU.3

                                                  18
   If a player presses a first game control button 27a during
   the defined time period after the reels start to spin, the
   reel controller 24 causes the reels to stop simultaneously
   258.
 5
   If a player does not press the first game control button
   27a but instead presses a second game control button 27b
   during the defined time period after the reels start to
   spin, the reel controller 24 causes the rightmost reel to
10 stop 262.                    If the second game control button 27b is
   subsequently pressed before expiration of a defined time
   period, the next rightmost spinning reel stops, and so on
   until no more reels are spinning.                     If the second game
   control button 27b is pressed once to cause the rightmost
15 reel to stop spinning but is not subsequently pressed
   within a defined time period, the reel controller 24
   causes the reels to stop automatically in a left to right
   sequence 270 with defined time periods between each reel
   stop.
20
   As an alternative to causing the reels to stop
   automatically in a left to right sequence 264 if the
   second game control button 27b is pressed once but is not
   subsequently pressed within a defined time period, the
25 reel controller 24 may cause the reels to stop
   automatically in a right to left sequence with defined
   time periods between each reel stop.
   The first game control button 27a may be a dedicated
30 button usable to implement a                    'slammed win' whereby all
   reels stop quickly and simultaneously.
   The second game control button 27b may be the same button
   used by a player to commence implementation of a game, or
35 a different button dedicated to control of reel stopping
   in a rightmost to leftmost sequence.
   10456775_1 (GHMaers) P84465.AU.3

                                            19
   After all reels have stopped spinning, the symbols
   displayed in the display area 308 are then evaluated 272
   by the outcome evaluator 28 and a prize paid if
   applicable.
 5
   It will be understood that with the present gaming system,
   irrespective of particular reel stopping sequence used,
   the outcome is the same in that the symbols to be
   displayed in the display area 308 are pre-selected by a
10 symbol selector and do not change based, for example, on
   the number of reel spins.              The present reel stopping
   arrangements provide a player with a degree of control
   over the reel stopping sequences so that that player may
   be presented with control over the appearance of the game,
15 and in particular over the time taken to stop all reels.
   It will also be understood that the gaming system may be
   arranged such that a             'slammed win' may still be activated
   even though the second game control button 27b has already
20 been pressed at least once.               With this variation, at least
   one rightmost reel will have already stopped spinning and
   activation of the second game control button 27b causes
   the remaining spinning reels to stop quickly and
   simultaneously.
25
   While the above example is described in relation to a
   video implementation of a spinning reel type probabilistic
   game wherein virtual reels are shown on a display, it will
   be understood that other variations are possible.               For
30 example, the reels may be physical reels controlled by one
   or more stepper motors.
   In the claims of this application and in the description
   of the invention, except where the context requires
35 otherwise due to express language or necessary
   implication, the words "comprise" or variations such as
   "comprises" or "comprising" are used in an inclusive
