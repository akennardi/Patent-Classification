   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
           The present invention relates to Neisseria meningitidis compositions and
   methods thereof.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
15         Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram-negative encapsulated bacterium that can
   cause sepsis, meningitis, and death. N. meningitidis can be classified into at least 12
   serogroups (including serogroups A, B, C, 29E, H, I, K, L, W-135, X, Y and Z) based on
   chemically and antigenically distinctive polysaccharide capsules. Strains with five of the
   serogroups (A, B, C, Y, and W135) are responsible for the majority of disease.
20         Meningococcal meningitis is a devastating disease that can kill children and
   young adults within hours despite the availability of antibiotics. There is a need for
   improved immunogenic compositions against meningococcal serogroups A, B, C, Y,
   and W135 and/or X.
           Currently, a cross-protective vaccine or composition effective against a wide
25 range of MnB isolates is not yet commercially available. For example, published
   results-to-date relating to a licensed multi-component composition for protection against
   serogroup B disease has not demonstrated a direct bactericidal immune response
   against multiple strains expressing heterologous LP2086 (fHBP) variants, at least in
   adolescents. At most, published results-to-date relating to the multi-component
30 composition for protection against serogroup B disease appear to show immunogenicity
   against LP2086 (fHBP) variants that are homologous to the LP2086 (fHBP) variant in
   the multi-component composition. Accordingly, a cross-protective vaccine or
   composition effective against diverse MnB isolates is needed as is determining real
   world vaccine coverage against a panel of diverse or heterologous meningococcal
35 strains (e.g., representing different geographical regions).
                                                  9

   not further include a polypeptide having less than 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID
    NO: 2. In one embodiment, the first polypeptide has a total of 258 amino acids. In one
   embodiment, the second polypeptide has a total of 261 amino acids. In one
   embodiment, the composition induces a bactericidal titer of serum immunoglobulin that
20 is at least 2-fold higher in the human after receiving the first dose than a bactericidal
   titer of serum immunoglobulin in the human prior to receiving the first dose, wherein the
   increase in bactericidal titer is measured under identical conditions in a serum
   bactericidal assay using human complement. In one embodiment, the first lipidated
   polypeptide consists of the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1. In one

   administered a fourth dose of the composition. In one embodiment, the third dose is
   administered to the human within a period of about 6 months after the first dose. In one
   embodiment, the second dose is administered at least 30 days after the first dose. In
   one embodiment, the method further includes administering a third dose of the
10 composition, wherein the third dose is administered at least 90 days after the second
   dose. In one embodiment, the composition induces a bactericidal titer of serum
   immunoglobulin that is at least 2-fold higher in the human after receiving the first dose
   than a bactericidal titer of serum immunoglobulin in the human prior to receiving the first
   dose, when measured under identical conditions in a serum bactericidal assay using

   heterologous to N. meningitidis strain CDC1 127.        In a preferred embodiment, the
   immune response is bactericidal against a N. meningitidis serogroup B subfamily B
25 strain that is heterologous to N. meningitidis strain CDC1573. In one embodiment, the
   first polypeptide has a total of 258 amino acids. In one embodiment, the second

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
           The inventors surprisingly discovered a composition that includes a first lipidated
   polypeptide including the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 and a second
   lipidated polypeptide including the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2. The
 5 composition has an acceptable safety profile in humans and the composition
   surprisingly elicits a broadly cross-reactive bactericidal immune response in humans
   against at least more than two diverse Neisseria meningitidis strains.
           The inventors further discovered that a 2-dose administration schedule and a 3
   dose administration schedule surprisingly yielded hSBA titers of 8 against test strains
10 from N. meningitidis serogroup B, with vaccine heterologous LP2086 (factor H binding
   protein (fHBP)) subfamilies A and B in a high proportion of human subjects. A 3-dose
   administration schedule may provide the broadest protection in humans against diverse
   MnB clinical strains, when compared to a 2-dose administration schedule.
           The inventors also surprisingly discovered that robust immune responses against
15 human papillomavirus and N. meningitidis serogroup B were generated after
   concomitant administration of the rLP2086 composition and a quadrivalent
   immunogenic composition against human papillomavirus (HPV4). For example, a
   concomitant administration of the rLP2086 composition and HPV4 composition
   generated an immune response at least against N. meningitidis serogroup B test strains
20 expressing fHBPs that are heterologous to those fHBPs in the rLP2086 composition.
   Such heterologous test strains include wild-type N. meningitidis serogroup B strains that
   express A22 fHBP, A56 fHBP, B24 fHBP, or B44 fHBP, which are each heterologous to
   the fHBPs in the rLP2086 composition. See WO/2012/032489, WO/2013/132452, US
   patent publication number US20120093852, and US patent publication number
25 US20130243807, which describe variant fHBP proteins, including A22 fHBP, A56 fHBP,
   B24 fHBP, and B44 fHBP, among others. These references are each incorporated by
   reference in their entirety. The concomitant administration also surprisingly generated
   an immune response at least against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and/or 18. The immune
   responses against the HPV types after concomitant administration of the rLP2086
30 composition and the HPV4 composition were noninferior when compared to the immune
   response generated by an administration of the HPV4 composition in the absence of the
   rLP2086 composition.
           In addition, the inventors surprisingly discovered that robust immune responses
   against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliomyelitis and N. meningitidis serogroup B
35 were generated after concomitant administration of the rLP2086 composition and an
                                                  A

   immunogenic composition against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliomyelitis. For
   example, a concomitant administration of the rLP2086 composition and REPEVAX
   composition generated an immune response at least against N. meningitidis serogroup
   B test strains expressing fHBPs that are heterologous to those fHBPs in the rLP2086
 5 composition. The concomitant administration also surprisingly generated an immune
   response at least against the 9 antigens in REPEVAX: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis
   toxoid, pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin, pertussis pertactin, pertussis fimbrial
   agglutinogens type 2 + 3, poliovirus type 1, poliovirus type 2, poliovirus type 3. The
   immune responses against the REPEVAX antigens after concomitant administration of
10 the rLP2086 composition and the REPEVAX composition were noninferior when
   compared to the immune response generated by an administration of the REPEVAX
   composition in the absence of the rLP2086 composition.
           Moreover, the inventors surprisingly discovered that the rLP2086 composition
   induces a bactericidal immune response against an ST409 N. meningitidis strain that
15 expresses the fHBP B153 variant. For example, the strain expressing the fHBP B153
   variant was found to be susceptible to killing when contacted with human bivalent
   rLP2086 composition immune sera, in a serum bactericidal assay using human
   complement (hSBA).

20         In one aspect, the invention relates to a composition against Neisseria
   meningitidis. The composition includes a first lipidated polypeptide having the amino
   acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, and a second lipidated polypeptide having the
   amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2.
          The inventors surprisingly discovered a single N. meningitidis polypeptide
25 component that induces an effective broadly protective immune response against
   multiple strains of N. meningitidis serogroup B. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the
   composition does not include a fusion protein. In one embodiment, the composition

   composition does not include a PorA protein. In another embodiment, the composition
   does not include a NadA protein. In another embodiment, the composition does not
   further include a Neisserial heparin binding antigen (NHBA). In another embodiment,

   a preferred embodiment, the composition does not further include antigens, other than
   the first polypeptide and the second polypeptide.
           In another aspect, the inventors surprisingly discovered that polypeptide antigens
   derived from at most two N. meningitidis serogroup B strains induces an effective
 5 broadly protective immune response against multiple strains of N. meningitidis
   serogroup B. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the composition does not further include

10 having less than 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 1. In another embodiment, the
   composition does not further include a polypeptide having less than 100% sequence
   identity to SEQ ID NO: 2. For example, the composition does not further include a
   polypeptide having less than 100% sequence identity to the full length of SEQ ID NO: 1
   and/or SEQ ID NO: 2.
15         In one embodiment, the composition further includes polysorbate-80, aluminum,
   histidine, and sodium chloride. In one embodiment, the composition includes about 60

           In another aspect, the composition includes about 120 pg/ml of a first lipidated
   polypeptide including the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, about 120
   pg/ml of a second lipidated polypeptide including the amino acid sequence set forth in
25 SEQ ID NO: 2, 2.8 molar ratio of polysorbate-80 to each polypeptide, 0.5 mg
   aluminum/ml as aluminum phosphate, 10 mM histidine, and 150 mM sodium chloride.
           In a further aspect, the composition includes a) 60 pg of a first lipidated
   polypeptide including the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1; b) 60 pg of a
   second lipidated polypeptide including the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:
30 2; c) 18 pg polysorbate-80 ; d) 250 pg aluminum,; e) 780 pg histidine, and; f) 4380 pg
   sodium chloride.
           In an exemplary embodiment, the composition includes about 60 pg of a first
   lipidated polypeptide consisting of the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1,
   about 60 pg of a second lipidated polypeptide consisting of the amino acid sequence
35 set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, 2.8 molar ratio of polysorbate-80 to first lipidated polypeptide
                                                  11

   and to second lipidated polypeptide, 0.5 mg/ml aluminum phosphate, 10 mM histidine,

   ml. In the exemplary embodiment, the composition is a sterile isotonic buffered liquid
   suspension. In the exemplary embodiment, the composition has a pH 6.0. In the
 5 exemplary embodiment, the first polypeptide and the second polypeptide are adsorbed
   to aluminum.
           In one embodiment, the composition has a total volume of about 0.5 ml. In one
   embodiment, a first dose of the composition has a total volume of about 0.5 ml. A "first
   dose" refers to the dose of the composition that is administered on Day 0. A "second
10 dose" or "third dose" refers to the dose of the composition that is administered

   POLYSORBATE-80
           Polysorbate 80 (PS-80) is a non-ionic surfactant. Accelerated stability studies
15 using an in vitro monoclonal antibody based potency assay demonstrated instability of
   the subfamily B protein at higher molar ratios of PS-80 to MnB rLP2086 protein in the
   final formulation. Further experiments with varying ratios of PS-80 have demonstrated
   that the optimal molar ratio of PS-80 to MnB rLP2086 protein is approximately 2.8 ± 1.4
   to retain potency.
20         The concentration of PS-80 in the composition is dependent on a molar ratio of
   PS-80 to the polypeptide. In one embodiment, the composition includes a 2.8±1.4
   molar ratio of PS-80 to the first polypeptide and to the second polypeptide. In one
   embodiment, the composition includes a 2.8±1.1 molar ratio of PS-80 to the first
   polypeptide and to the second polypeptide. In one embodiment, the composition
25 includes at least 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, or 3.3
   molar ratio of PS-80 to polypeptide. Preferably, the composition includes a 2.8 molar
   ratio of PS-80 to polypeptide.
           The PS-80 to polypeptide molar ratio is determined by calculation from the
   measured concentration of PS-80 and the measured total polypeptide concentration, in
30 which both values are expressed in moles. For example, PS-80 to Protein molar ratio is
   determined by calculation of the measured concentration of PS-80 (e.g., by reverse
   phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC)) to the measured total protein
   concentration (e.g., by ion exchange-high pressure liquid chromatography (IEX-HPLC))
   in the final drug substance, where both values are expressed in moles.
                                                   17

           A RP-HPLC is used to quantitate the concentration of Polysorbate 80 in vaccine
   formulations. The concentration of detergent is determined by saponification of the fatty
   acid moiety; Polysorbate 80 is converted to free oleic acid by alkaline hydrolysis at
   400C. The sample is separated by RP-HPLC using a C18 column and quantitated using
 5 a UV detector at a wavelength of 200 nm.
           The first and the second polypeptides are resolved by anion-exchange HPLC.
   rLP2086(fHBP) Subfamily A and B proteins elute at distinct retention times and are
   quantitated using a standard curve generated against the respective rLP2086 protein
   reference material.
10         The term "molar ratio" and a description of an immunogenic composition
   including a fHBP and PS-80 is further disclosed in W02012025873 and US patent
   publication US 2013/0171194, which are each incorporated by reference in their
   entirety.
            The term "molar ratio" as used herein refers to the ratio of the number of moles
15 of two different elements in a composition. In some embodiments, the molar ratio is the
   ratio of moles of detergent to moles of polypeptide. In some embodiments, the molar
   ratio is the ratio of moles of PS-80 to moles of protein. In one embodiment, based on
   the protein and Polysorbate 80 concentrations, the Molar Ratio may be calculated using
   the following equation:
20         Molar Ratio = % PS-80        x 216

   BACTERICIDAL ACTIVITY
           Immune response induced by administering the composition to a human is
   determined using a serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA) against
   four N. meningitidis serogroup B (MnB) strains. The 4 MnB strains used in the hSBA
 5 were selected from a strain pool. The strain pool represented a collection of
   systematically collected clinically relevant N. meningitidis serogroup B strains from the
    US and Europe. Two of the 4 strains for the SBA are from N. meningitidis serogroup B
   LP2086 (fHBP) subfamily A, and another two of the 4 strains are from N. meningitidis
   serogroup B LP2086(fHBP) subfamily B.
10         The high proportion of hSBA response to all test strains, especially strains
   expressing lipoprotein 2086 variants with sequences heterologous to the first
   polypeptide suggests that the composition is a broadly protective vaccine and that two
   doses are sufficient to confer high seroprotection at least against N. meningitidis
   serogroup B subfamily A strains.
15         The high proportion of hSBA response to all test strains, especially strains
   expressing lipoprotein 2086 variants with sequences heterologous to both the first
   polypeptide and the second polypeptide suggests that the composition is a broadly
   protective vaccine and that at most three doses within about a 6 month period are
   sufficient to confer high seroprotection against N. meningitidis serogroup B strains
20 expressing rLP2086 (FHBP) subfamily A and/or subfamily B.
           In one embodiment, the hSBA strain is an LP2086 (fHBP) subfamily A strain. In
   one embodiment, the hSBA strain is an LP2086 (fHBP) subfamily A strain that
   expresses a lipoprotein 2086 variant that is heterologous to a N. meningitidis strain

 5 subfamily B strain. Preferably, the immune response is bactericidal against a N.

   B subfamily A strain is greater than the immune response against the N. meningitidis
10 serogroup B subfamily B strain. For example, in one embodiment, the immunogenic

   subfamily A strain than against a N. meningitidis serogroup B subfamily B strain, when
   tested under identical conditions. In one embodiment, the higher bactericidal titers

   TITERS
           In one embodiment, the composition induces an increase in bactericidal titer in
   the human, as compared to the bactericidal titer in the human prior to administration of
   a dose of the composition, when measured under identical conditions in an hSBA. In
 5 one embodiment, the increase in bactericidal titer is compared to the bactericidal titer in
   the human before administration of the first dose of the composition, as compared to the
   bactericidal titer in the human prior to administration of the first dose of the composition,
   when measured under identical conditions in an hSBA. In one embodiment, the
   increase in titer is observed after a second dose of the composition, as compared to the
10 bactericidal titer in the human prior to administration of the second dose of the
   composition, when measured under identical conditions in an hSBA. In another
   embodiment, the increase in bactericidal titer is observed after a third dose of the
   composition, as compared to the bactericidal titer in the human prior to administration of
   the third dose of the composition, when measured under identical conditions in an
15 hSBA.
           In one embodiment, the composition induces a bactericidal titer in the human
   after administration of a dose, wherein the bactericidal titer is at least greater than 1-fold
   higher than the bactericidal titer in the human prior to administration of the dose, when
   measured under identical conditions in an hSBA. For example, the bactericidal titer
20 may be at least 1.01-fold, 1.1-fold, 1.5-fold, 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8
   fold, 9-fold, 10-fold, 11-fold, 12-fold, 13-fold, 14-fold, 15-fold, or 16-fold higher in the
   human after receiving a dose of the composition, as compared to the bactericidal titer in
   the human prior to administration of the dose, when measured under identical
   conditions in an hSBA.
25         In one embodiment, a "responder" refers to a human, wherein the composition
   induces a bactericidal titer in the human after administration of a dose, wherein the
   bactericidal titer is at least greater than 1-fold higher than the bactericidal titer in the
   human prior to administration of the dose. In a preferred embodiment, the responder
   achieves at least a      4-fold rise in hSBA titer, as compared to a bactericidal titer in the
30 human prior to administration of the dose. Such a responder may be referred to as
   having a protective titer.
           In one embodiment, the hSBA titer is the reciprocal of the highest dilution of a
   serum sample that produces a measurable effect. For example, in one embodiment,
   the hSBA titer is the reciprocal of the highest 2-fold dilution of a test serum that results
35 in at least a 50% reduction of MnB bacteria (50% bacterial survival) compared to the
                                                   9.1

   T30 CFU value (i.e., the number of bacteria surviving after incubation in assay wells
   containing all assay components except test serum; 100% bacterial survival).
           In one embodiment, the composition induces a bactericidal titer in the human
   after receiving the first dose that is at least 2-fold higher than the bactericidal titer in the
 5 human prior to receiving the first dose (e.g., higher than the bactericidal titer in the
   human in the absence of the first dose), when measured under identical conditions in
   the hSBA. In one embodiment, the composition induces a bactericidal titer in the
   human that is at least 4-fold higher than the bactericidal titer in the human prior to
   receiving the first dose, when measured under identical conditions in a human serum
10 bactericidal assay that utilizes human complement (hSBA). In one embodiment, the
   composition induces a bactericidal titer in the human that is at least 8-fold higher than
   the bactericidal titer in the human prior to receiving the first dose, when measured under
   identical conditions in a human serum bactericidal assay that utilizes human
   complement (hSBA).
15         In a preferred embodiment, the human serum complement is derived from a
   human having low intrinsic bactericidal activity for a given SBA test strain. Low intrinsic
   bactericidal activity refers to, for example, a bactericidal titer that is at least less than a
   1:4 dilution against the given SBA test strain. In one embodiment, the human
   complement is derived from a human having an hSBA titer that is at least less than 1:4,
20 such as a 1:2 dilution, against the given SBA test strain, wherein the composition was
   not administered to the human.
           A human may exhibit an hSBA titer of less than 1:4 prior to administration of a
   composition, such as the bivalent rLP2086 composition, or a human may exhibit an
   hSBA titer of 1:4 prior to administration of the composition. Accordingly, in preferred
25 embodiments and examples, administration of at least one dose of the composition to
   the human results in an hSBA titer that is at least greater than 1:4, such as, for
   example, an hSBA titer of 21:8, an hSBA titer of 21:16, and an hSBA titer of 21:32. The
   respective Examples described herein include assessments of the proportion of human
   subjects having an hSBA titer 1:8 and/or        1:16, wherein the bivalent rLP2086
30 composition was administered to the human. Such preferred assessments of hSBA
   titers greater than 1:4 show that the protection, i.e., the bactericidal immune response
   induced in the human, is associated with the composition.
           In one embodiment, the human has an hSBA titer equal to or greater than the
   hSBA's lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) after administration of the first dose of the
35 composition. In another embodiment, the human has an hSBA titer equal to or greater

than the hSBA's LLOQ after administration of the second dose of the composition. In
another embodiment, the human has an hSBA titer equal to or greater than the hSBA's
LLOQ after administration of the third dose of the composition.

   ADDITIONAL IMMUNOGENIC COMPOSITIONS
            The inventors surprisingly discovered that the immunogenic composition against
   N. meningitidis may be administered with an immunogenic composition against human
   papillomavirus (HPV) without negatively affecting the bactericidal response against N.
 5 meningitidis. As explained in Example 7 and Example 8, substantial hSBA responses
   to N. meningitidis test strains were observed among humans who were administered
   with the immunogenic composition against N. meningitidis and GARDASIL and in
   humans who were administered with the immunogenic composition against N.
   meningitidis and saline. Additional increases in hSBA responses were observed about
10  1 month after a third dose of the immunogenic composition against N. meningitidis.
            Moreover, the inventors surprisingly discovered that robust immune responses
   against both N. meningitidis and HPV were generated in the human following an
   administration of both the immunogenic composition against N. meningitidis and the
   immunogenic composition against HPV, as compared to the immune response in the
15 human before administration of the compositions. As explained in Example 7 and
   Example 8, titers against HPV increased in the human after an administration of the
   immunogenic composition against N. meningitidis and GARDASIL, as compared to the
   titers in the human prior to administration of the immunogenic compositions. The
   increase in titers against HPV was at least greater than 1-fold, at least 2-fold, at least 3
20 fold, at least 4-fold, or more.
            Accordingly, in one embodiment, the method includes inducing an immune
   response against N. meningitidis in a human, wherein the method further includes
   administering to the human an immunogenic composition against human
   papillomavirus. Preferably, the immune response is bactericidal against N. meningitidis.
25 In one embodiment, the method further includes inducing an immune response against
   HPV. In a preferred embodiment, the method further includes inducing an immune
   response against any one of human papillomavirus types 6, 11, 16, and 18, or any
   combination thereof. In one embodiment, the immunogenic ccomposition against HPV
   is administered to the human within 24 hours of administering said composition against
30 N. meningitidis.
            In one embodiment, the method includes inducing an immune response against
   N. meningitidis in a human, wherein the method further includes administering to the
   human an immunogenic composition against HPV. Preferably, the immune response is
   bactericidal against N. meningitidis. In one embodiment, the method further includes
35 inducing an immune response against HPV. In a preferred embodiment, the method

   further includes inducing an immune response against any one of human papillomavirus
   types 6, 11, 16, and 18, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, the
   immunogenic composition against human papillomavirus is administered to the human
   within 24 hours of administering said composition against N. meningitidis.
 5         In another aspect, the inventors surprisingly discovered that the immunogenic
   composition against N. meningitidis may be administered with an immunogenic
   composition against diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, and inactivated poliomyelitis
   virus (dTaP) without negatively affecting the bactericidal response against N.
   meningitidis. As explained in Example 4, substantial hSBA responses to N. meningitidis
10 test strains were observed among humans who were administered with the
   immunogenic composition against N. meningitidis and REPEVAX. Additional increases
   in hSBA responses were observed about 1 month after a third dose of the immunogenic
   composition against N. meningitidis.
           Moreover, the inventors surprisingly discovered that robust immune responses
15 against both N. meningitidis and dTaP were generated in the human following an
   administration of both the immunogenic composition against N. meningitidis and the
   immunogenic composition against dTaP, as compared to the immune response in the
   human before administration of the compositions. As explained in Example 4, titers
   against dTaP increased in the humanafter an administration of the immunogenic
20 composition against N. meningitidis and REPEVAX, as compared to the titers in the
   human prior to administration of the immunogenic compositions. The increase in titers
   against dTaP was at least greater than 1-fold, at least 2-fold, at least 3-fold, at least 4
   fold, or more.

   METHODS AND ADMINISTRATION
           In one aspect, the invention relates to a method of inducing an immune response
   against N. meningitidis in a human. In another aspect, the invention relates to a method
   of vaccinating a human. In one embodiment, the method includes administering to the
 5 human at least one dose of the composition described above. In another embodiment,
   the method includes administering to the human at least a first dose and a second dose
   of the composition described above.
           Surprisingly, the inventors discovered that a two-dose schedule of the
   composition induced a bactericidal titer against diverse heterologous subfamily A and
10 against diverse heterologous subfamily B strains in the human. For example, the
   percentage of humans with an hSBA titer 1:8 was 90% or greater for SBA test strains
   expressing LP2086 (fHBP) A22 or LP2086 (fHBP) A56 following a two-dose schedule of
   the composition described above. See Example 1.
           In one embodiment, the second dose is administered at least 20, 30, 50, 60, 100,
15  120, 160, 170, or 180 days after the first dose, and at most 250, 210, 200, or 190 days
   after the first dose. Any minimum value may be combined with any maximum value
   described herein to define a range.
           In another embodiment, the second dose is administered about 30 days after the
   first dose. In another embodiment, the second dose is administered about 60 days after
20 the first dose, such as, for example, in a 0, 2 month immunization schedule. In another
   embodiment, the second dose is administered about 180 days after the first dose, such
   as, for example, in a 0, 6 month immunization schedule. In yet another embodiment,
   the second dose is administered about 120 days after the first dose, such as, for
   example, in a 2, 6 month immunization schedule.
25         In one embodiment, the method includes administering to the human two doses
   of the composition and at most two doses. In one embodiment, the two doses are
   administered within a period of about 6 months after the first dose. In one embodiment,
   the method does not include further administration of a booster to the human. A
   "booster" as used herein refers to an additional administration of the composition to the
30 human. Administering to the human at most two doses of the composition may be
   advantageous. Such advantages include, for example, facilitating a human to comply
   with a complete administration schedule and facilitating cost-effectiveness of the
   schedule.
           In one embodiment, the first dose and the second dose are administered to the
35 human over a period of about 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140,

   150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or 200 days, and most 400, 390, 380, 370, 365, 350, 340, 330,
   320, 310, 300, 290, 280, 270, 260, 250, 240, 230, 220, 210, or 200 days after the first
   dose. Any minimum value may be combined with any maximum value described herein
   to define a range.
 5         In one embodiment, the first dose and the second dose are administered to the
   human over a period of about 30 days. In another embodiment, the first dose and the
   second dose are administered to the human over a period of about 60 days. In another
   embodiment, the first dose and the second dose are administered to the human over a
   period of about 180 days.

   THREE DOSES
           The inventors further surprisingly discovered that a three-dose schedule of the
   composition induced a broader bactericidal titer against strains expressing heterologous
   LP2086 (fHBP) subfamily B strains in a greater percentage of humans than a two-dose
 5 schedule. For example, the percentage of humans with a hSBA titer 21:8 was 65% or
   greater for SBA test strains LP2086 (fHBP) B24 and LP2086 (fHBP) B44 following a
   two-dose schedule of the composition described above. The percentage of humans
   with a hSBA titer 21:8 was 86% or greater for SBA test strains B24 and B44 following a
   three-dose schedule of the composition described above. See Example 1.
10         Accordingly, in one embodiment, a three-dose schedule of the composition
   induces a bactericidal titer against multiple strains expressing LP2086 (fHBP)
   heterologous to the first and/or second polypeptide in a greater percentage of humans
   than a two-dose schedule.
           In one embodiment, the method includes administering to the human three doses
15 of the composition. In another embodiment, the method includes administering at most
   three doses of the composition. In one embodiment, the three doses are administered
   within a period of about 6 months after the first dose. In one embodiment, the method
   includes an administration of a booster dose to the human after the third dose. In
   another embodiment, the method does not include administration of a booster dose to
20 the human after the third dose. In another embodiment, the method does not further
   include administering a fourth or booster dose of the composition to the human. In a
   further embodiment, at most three doses within a period of about 6 months are
   administered to the human.
           In an exemplary embodiment, the second dose is administered about 30 days
25 after the first dose, and the third dose is administered about 150 days after the second
   dose, such as, for example, in a 0, 1, 6 month immunization schedule. In another
   exemplary embodiment, the second dose is administered about 60 days after the first
   dose, and the third dose is administered about 120 days after the second dose, such
   as, for example, in a 0, 2, 6 month immunization schedule.
30         In one embodiment, the first dose, second dose, and third dose are administered
   to the human over a period of about 150, 160, 170, or 180 days, and at most 240, 210
   200, or 190 days. Any minimum value may be combined with any maximum value
   described herein to define a range. Preferably, the first dose, second dose, and third
   dose is administered to the human over a period of about 180 days or 6 months. For
35 example, the second dose may be administered to the human about 60 days after the

   first dose, and the third dose may be administered to the human about 120 days after
   the second dose. Accordingly, an exemplary schedule of administration includes
   administering a dose to the human at about months 0, 2, and 6.
           As described above, multiple doses of the immunogenic composition may be
 5 administered to the human, and the number of days between each dose may vary. An
   advantage of the method includes, for example, flexibility for a human to comply with
   the administration schedules.

   EXAMPLE 1: Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of an Investigational
   Meningococcal Serogroup B Bivalent (MnB) rLP2086 Vaccine in Healthy
   Adolescents When Administered in Regimens of 2 or 3 Doses in Healthy Subjects
   aged 11 to 18 Years
 5 Background: Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an investigational bivalent,
   recombinant vaccine (rLP2086) were studied in healthy adolescents 11-18 years of age
   using 5 dose regimens including 2 or 3 vaccinations (Table 1).
           The vaccine is a 0.5 ml-dose formulated to contain 60 pg each of a purified
   subfamily A and a purified subfamily B rLP2086 protein, 2.8 molar ratio polysorbate-80,
10 and 0.25 mg of Al3 as AlPO 4 , 10 mM histidine-buffered saline at pH 6.0.
           Saline is used as a placebo because there is no known proven safe,
   immunogenic, and effective vaccine against MnB that could serve as an active control.
   The normal saline solution includes 0.9% sodium chloride in a 0.5 ml dose.
   Methods: All subjects in this phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind
15 study attended vaccination visits at months 0, 1, 2 and 6. For blinding, a saline control
   was given when vaccine was not scheduled. Serum bactericidal assays using human
   complement (hSBA) were performed with 4 MnB test strains expressing LP2086 (fHBP)
   fHBP variants A22, A56, B24 and B44 (i.e., the 4 "primary hSBA test strains" in the
   primary endpoint analysis), all of which are different from the variants in the vaccine.
20 Unsolicited adverse events (AE), solicited local and systemic reactions, and antipyretic
   use were assessed.
           Geometric mean hSBA titers were computed for each primary strain at each
   blood sampling time point along with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Geometric
   mean fold rises were computed along with 95% CIs.
25         A responder was defined as a subject with an hSBA titer equal or above the
   lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the hSBA assays. The LLOQ for each of the 4
   hSBA test strains in the primary endpoint analysis was an hSBA titer equal to 1:8. The
   limit of detection (LOD) for each primary test strain was a titer equal to 1:4 (widely
   viewed as the correlate of protection against meningococcal disease).
30 Results: 1 month after the last vaccine dose, 86-99% subjects (after 3 doses; P<0.001)
   and 69-100% of subjects (after 2 doses) had hSBA titers 28 to each MnB test strain.
   After study dose 1, 19-27% (1.1-4.3% severe) and 23-27% (0.0-1.0% severe) of
   rLP2086 recipients experienced redness and swelling, respectively, by group. Injection
   site pain was the most common local reaction after study dose 1 (7.6-13.1% severe).
35  Fever >381C after the first study dose of the bivalent rLP2086 vaccine was experienced

      in 3.3-6.5% by group compared to 2.1% in saline recipients. Local and systemic
      reactions were generally more frequent after dose 1 than after subsequent doses. 43 of
      1712 subjects (2.5%) reported 51 serious AEs; 2 cases were considered related (1 case
      of vertigo, chills and headache and I case of fever and vomiting). No deaths were
 5    reported.

      Conclusions: Bivalent rLP2086 had an acceptable safety profile. All 5 dosing regimens
      yielded hSBA titers 28 against all 4 test strains in a high proportion of subjects. The
10    higher proportions against some test strains after 3 doses compared with 2 doses
      indicate that 3 doses may provide the broadest protection against diverse MnB clinical
      strains. Global phase 3 clinical trials are underway with the bivalent rLP2086 vaccine.
                   One of the objectives of this study was to assess the immune response, as
      measured by hSBA performed with MnB strains expressing LP2086 subfamily A and B
15    proteins, 1 month after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086, among Group 1
      subjects (0-, 1-, and 6- month schedule as randomized) and among Group 2 subjects
      (0-, 2-, and 6-month schedule as randomized). An endpoint for the immunogenicity
      analysis was the proportion of subjects in Groups 1 and 2 achieving an hSBA titer 2
      LLOQ at Month 7 (or I month after the third dose of bivalent rLP2086) for each of the 4
20    primary MnB test strains (A22, A56, B24, and B44). The LLOQ was 1:8 for the 4
      primary MnB test strains.
                   For the evaluable immunogenicity population, the proportion of subjects in Group
      1 achieving an hSBA titer 2 1:8 after 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086 was 91.7% for A22,
      99.4% for A56, 89% for B24, and 88.5% for 844 (See Table 1 above). Since the lower
25    limit of the 97.5% Cl was >50% for all strains (87.8%, p<0.001; 97.8%, p<0.001; 84.7%,
      p<0.001; and 84.1%, p<0.001 for strains A22, A56, B24, and B44, respectively, the
      study objective was met for subjects in Group 1.
                                                                                        36

            For Group 2, the proportion of subjects achieving an hSBA titer    1:8 after 3
   doses of bivalent rLP2086 was 95.0% for A22, 98.9% for A56, 88.4% for B24, and
   86.1% for B44 (See Table 1 above). Similar to what was seen for Group 1, the lower
   limit of the 97.5% CI was >50% for all strains (91.7%, p<0.001; 96.9%, p<0.001; 84.1%,
 5 p<0.001; and 81.4%, p<0.001 for strains A22, A56, B24, and B44, respectively,
   demonstrating that the objective was also met for the subjects in Group 2.
           A secondary objective was to assess the immune response, as measured by
   hSBA performed with MnB strains expressing LP2086 subfamily A and B proteins, 1
   month after the second dose of bivalent rLP2086, among group 3 subjects (0- and 6
10 month schedule as randomized). This secondary objective was the proportion of
   subjects in Group 3 achieving an hSBA titer      LLOQ (1:8) at Month 7 (or 1 month after
   the second dose of bivalent rLP2086) for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains.
           This secondary objective was also met since the proportion of subjects in Group
   3 achieving an hSBA titer > 1:8 after 2 doses of bivalent rLP2086 was 93.5%, 98.4%,
15 81.1%, and 77.5% for the primary MnB test strains with the lower limit of the 97.5% Cl >
   50% for all strains (90.0%, p<0.001; 96.2%, p<0.001; 76.0%, p<0.001; and 72.2%,
   p<0.001 for strains A22, A56, B24, and B44, respectively. See Table 1 above).
           Another secondary objective was the proportion of subjects with hSBA titer >
   LLOQ for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains at each blood sampling time point for
20 subjects in Groups 1 to 5. The LLOQ for each of the 4 primary hSBA test strains was a
   titer of 1:8. The proportions of subjects with an hSBA titer   1:8 by study time for the
   evaluable immunogenicity population is shown in Table 1 above.
            The proportion of subjects who had an hSBA titer    1:8 after 1 dose of bivalent
   rLP2086 (Group 5 [2- and 6-month schedule] 1 month after Injection 3) was 55.9% for
25 A22, 67.6% for A56, 56.9% for B24, and 23.8% for B44.
            The proportion of subjects who had an hSBA titer    1:8 one month after 2 doses
   of bivalent rLP2086 ranged from 74.6% to 100% for subfamily A strains, and from
   54.0% to 81.1% for subfamily B strains. After 3 doses, the proportion increased and
   ranged from 91.7% to 99.4% and from 86.1% to 89.0% for subfamily A and B strains,
30 respectively.

   EXAMPLE 2: SERUM BACTERICIDAL ASSAY USING HUMAN COMPLEMENT
         (HSBA)
           MnB clearance from the human bloodstream is primarily achieved by
   complement-mediated bacteriolysis and an intact complement system is important for
 5 resistance against infections caused by MnB. The in vivo complement-mediated
   bacteriolysis of MnB is mimicked in vitro by the serum bactericidal assay using human
   complement (hSBA), a functional serological assay shown to be the surrogate of
   protection for meningococcal disease. That is, demonstration of bacterial killing in the
   serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA) correlates with protection
10 against meningococcal disease. Immunity elicited by the vaccine is determined using
   hSBAs against 4 MnB strains (fHBP variants A22, A56, B24, and B44).
          The four primary MnB test strains were used in the hSBAs described in the
   Examples for the determination of endpoints. That is, these strains were used to
   estimate vaccine efficacy using hSBA immunogenicity endpoints. These test strains
15 represent 4 of the 6 fHBP phylogenetic subgroups that account for >90% of disease
   isolates circulating in the USA and Europe.

           In selecting the 4 primary MnB test strains from invasive disease isolates, an
   approach was used which took into account the population distribution of the in vitro
20 LP2086 surface expression. Furthermore, the hSBA test strains had to show low
   baseline hSBA positivity, as the populations at risk for meningococcal disease are
   characterized by non-existing or low baseline bactericidal activity to most strains. In
   addition, each of the 4 primary MnB test strains expresses an LP2086 variant that is
   different from the LP2086 variant in the vaccine, thus allowing an objective assessment

   of functional immunogenicity and efficacy to invasive meningococcal disease (IMD)
   strains circulating in the population.
           The hSBA measures the amount of anti-meningococcal serogroup B (MnB)
   antibody in serum capable of initiating complement-mediated bactericidal activity.
 5 Briefly, test serum is serially-diluted in 2-fold steps and added to 96-well assay plates.
   MnB SBA test strains and human serum complement are added, initiating the
   bactericidal reaction. After incubation of the assay plates at 370C for 30-60 minutes
   (depending on SBA test strain; called T30), the reaction mixture containing bacteria
   surviving this incubation are diluted and transferred to microfilter plates. Following
10 overnight incubation, surviving bacteria expressed as colony-forming units (CFU) are
   enumerated using an Immunospot Analyzer. The raw CFU data are recorded
   electronically and transferred to a data analysis application that calculates the hSBA
   titer. The hSBA titer is the reciprocal of the highest 2-fold dilution of a test serum that
   results in at least a 50% reduction of MnB bacteria (50% bacterial survival) compared to
15 the T30 CFU value (i.e., the number of bacteria surviving after incubation in assay wells
   containing all assay components except test serum; 100% bacterial survival). Titers
   may be reported as step titers, i.e., 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, etc. Serum samples are tested by
   two individual, replicate determinations in the same assay. The final titer reported for
   samples in which the replicate measurements are not identical is the lower of the two
20 replicate measurements when system suitability and sample suitability criteria (e.g.
   replicate titers must agree within one 2-fold dilution) are met.
           hSBA assays were done after serially diluting test sera in Dulbecco's phosphate
   buffered saline. Bacteria (roughly 2000 colony-forming units) and human serum
   complement (20% by weight final concentration) were added to the serially diluted sera
25 in 96-well plates and incubated at 37'C for 30-40 min (depending on hSBA test strain)
   in a small-radius orbital shaker at 700 rpm. After incubation, a portion of the reaction
   mixture was transferred to microfilter plates. After overnight incubation, surviving
   bacteria were counted with an Immunospot Analyzer (Cellular Technology Limited;
   Shaker Heights, OH, USA) and hSBA titers were analysed with SAS (version 9.2). The
30 hSBA titer was calculated as the reciprocal of the interpolated test serum dilution that
   resulted in a 50% reduction of bacteria compared with a control not subjected to test
   serum (i.e., surviving bacteria at the end of the hSBA reaction). Per protocol hSBAs
   were done on the basis of the hSBA titer that was at or above the lower limit of
   quantitation of the hSBA assays as established during qualification of the assays with
35 strains listed in the Table 1 of Example 1.

        Human serum is the complement source for the SBA. However, the hSBA titers
  may vary depending on the human complement lot used. Accordingly, human
  complement is preferably controlled through rigorous screening and qualification to
  ensure consistent performance in the hSBA. For the hSBA, human serum complement
5 may be pooled from multiple normal healthy human adults or used from individual
  donors (i.e., not pooled).

   EXAMPLE 3- POLYSORBATE-80
          Three parameters have been optimized for drug product formulation: pH,
   aluminum concentration and polysorbate 80 (PS-80) to protein molar ratio. In a dose of
   the composition having a total volume of 0.5 ml, optimal protein binding to aluminum is
 5 achieved at a pH of about 6.0 and about a 0.5 mg/ml concentration of aluminum as
   aluminum phosphate (AIPO 4 ) (which is equivalent to 0.25 mg aluminum per dose). The
   PS-80 to protein molar ratio is maintained at 2.8 ± 1.4 in order to stabilize the
   formulation with respect to in vitro potency. Polysorbate 80 (PS-80) is added to drug
   substance to obtain the target PS-80 to protein molar ratio of 2.8. Therefore, PS-80 is
10 preferably not added during the drug product formulation.

   EXAMPLE 4
   Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 2 Study of The Immunogenicity
   And Safety Of REPEVAX@ Administered Concomitantly With Bivalent
   rLP2086 Vaccine In Healthy Adolescents
 5
   Background/Aims: The investigational bivalent rLP2086 vaccine, being developed to
   prevent Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MnB) disease in adolescents, was
   evaluated with concomitant administration of REPEVAX        ®, a dTaP-inactivated polio
   vaccine (which may be described in U.S. Patent No. 7479283, W01990/013313, and
10 EP1666057 B1, and UK Marketing Authorisation PL06745/0121) currently used in this
   population.
   Methods: Adolescents, randomized 1:1 to REPEVAX+rLP2086 or REPEVAX +saline
   were vaccinated at 0, 2, and 6 months. The proportion of subjects achieving
   prespecified antibody levels to 9 REPEVAX antigens 30 days after initial vaccination
15 were determined. Immune responses (hSBA) to 4 MnB test strains were measured 30
   days after vaccinations 2 and 3. Adverse events (AE) and local/systemic reactions were
   assessed.
           REPEVAX (Sanofi Pasteur MSD limited) is a combined low-dose diphtheria,
   tetanus, acellular pertussis, and inactivated poliomyelitis virus vaccine containing
20 diphtheria toxoid (not less than 2 IU), tetanus toxoid (not less than 20 IU), pertussis
   antigens (pertussis toxoid (2.5 micrograms), filamentous haemagglutinin (5
   micrograms), pertacti (3 micrograms), and fimbriae Types 2 and 3 (5 micrograms)),
   polio virus (inactivated) type 1 (40 D antigen units), poliovirus (inactivated type 2 (8 D
   antigen units), poliovirus (inactivated) type 3 (32 D antigen units), adsorbed on
25 aluminum phosphate (1.5 mg (0.33 mg aluminum)) per 0.5-mL dose.
           Immune responses to the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis components of
   REPEVAX (diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis toxoid, pertactin, fimbriae types 2
   and 3 and filamentous haemagglutinin) were assessed using a multiplexed LUMINEX
   assay. Immune responses to poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 were measured in virus
30 neutralization assays. Sera obtained from all subjects in both groups were used in
   these assays.
           For assessment of the immune response to bivalent rLP2086, functional
   antibodies were analyzed in hSBAs with the 4 primary MnB test strains described. Four
                                                 149

   primary MnB hSBA test strains (A22, A56, B44, and B24), 2 expressing LP2086
   subfamily A and the other 2 expressing LP2086 subfamily B variants were selected.
   These 4 primary hSBA test strains (from 4 of the 6 fHBP phylogenetic subgroups and
   representing >90% of disease isolates circulating in the USA and Europe) were used for
 5 determination of the primary immunogenicity endpoints in this study. Additionally, the
   A22, B24, and B44 variants are epidemiologically relevant variants in Europe, while in
   the US, A22 and B24 are the most prevalent variants found expressed on disease
   causing MnB strains. The MnB hSBAs were validated prior to testing of samples used
   for the primary and secondary analyses.
10         Serum samples from 50% of randomly selected subjects in both groups had
   hSBA performed with A22 and B24 and the other 50% were tested with A56 and B44.
   These tests were performed on blood samples collected before Vaccination 1, after
   Vaccination 2, and after Vaccination 3.
           The immunogenicity of REPEVAX is assessed by using prespecified criteria for
15 each antigen defined in the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials in adolescents that formed the
   basis of licensure for REPEVAX. The REPEVAX concomitant antigens include
   diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis toxoid, pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin, pertussis
   pertactin, pertussis fimbrial agglutinogens type 2 + 3, poliovirus type 1, poliovirus type 2,
   poliovirus type 3. The exception is for pertussis fimbrial agglutinogens (FIM) types 2 +
20 3, which defined a titer of 25 EU/mL in the assay used for licensure of REPEVAX. In
   this study the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of the pertussis FIM types 2 + 3 assay
   was 210.6 EU/mL, which is higher and therefore more stringent than the licensing
   criteria of REPEVAX.
           The LLOQs for the concomitant antigens were 0.037 IU/mL for diphtheria toxoid;
25 0.05 IU/ml for tetanus toxoid; 0.9 EU/mL for pertussis toxoid; 2.9 EU/mL for pertussis
   filamentous hemagglutinin, 3.0 EU/mL pertussis pertactin; 10.6 EU/mL pertussis fimbrial
   agglutinogens type 2 + 3; 1:8 for poliovirus type 1, poliovirus type 2, poliovirus type 3.
           Additional descriptive endpoints for the primary objective were the antibodies to
   concomitant vaccine antigens measured as geometric mean titer (GMTs) or geometric
30 mean concentrations (GMCs) at postvaccination 1 (Visit 2).
           Another endpoint was the proportion of subjects with hSBA titer > LLOQ at
    Postvaccination 3 (Visit 6) for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains.
           Concomitant vaccine antigens. The proportion of subjects achieving the
   prespecified criteria for the concomitant vaccine antigens 1 month after vaccination of

   diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis acellular (dTaP)-IPV (REPEVAX) was computed with
   a 2-sided 95% exact (or Clopper-Pearson confidence limit) for Group 1 and Group 2.
   The difference (bivalent rLP2086 / dTaP-IPV - dTaP-IPV, or Group 1 - Group 2) of the
   proportions was also calculated along with a 2-sided 95% exact CI for the difference.
 5 Noninferiority was declared if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference was
   greater than -0.10 (-10%) for all of the 9 antigens in the dTaP-IPV vaccine.
           hSBAs with Primary Test Strains. For each primary MnB hSBA test strain, the
   number and proportion of subjects achieving hSBA titers        LLOQ, 1:4, 21:8, 21:16,
   and   1:128 at each blood sampling time point were descriptively summarized along with
10 the exact 2-sided 95% CI (or Clopper-Pearson confidence limit) for the proportion.
   Results: Of 749 subjects randomized, 685 (91.5%) included the evaluable
   immunogenicity population. Immune responses following REPEVAX +rLP2086 or
   REPEVAX +saline were noninferior for all 9 REPEVAX antigens. Immune responses to
   the bivalent rLP2086 vaccine were substantial after 2 doses and further enhanced after
15 3 doses (Table 2). Mild-to-moderate injection site pain was the most common local
   reaction; headache and fatigue were the most common systemic events. The proportion
   of subjects reporting an AE within 30 days postvaccination was similar (8.8% and
   11.4%, for REPEVAX +rLP2086 and REPEVAX +saline, respectively).
           For the concomitant vaccine evaluable immunogenicity population, the proportion
20 of subjects achieving the prespecified level of antibodies to concomitant vaccine
   antigens (threshold for response) 1 month after the REPEVAX dose was similar
   between the bivalent rLP2086 + REPEVAX group and the REPEVAX alone group for
   concomitant vaccine antigens: diphtheria toxoid (99.4% in each group), tetanus toxoid
   (100% in each group), pertussis toxoid (94.7% and 96.0%, respectively), pertussis
25 filamentous hemagglutinin (100% in each group), pertussis pertactin (100% in each
   group), pertussis fimbrial agglutinogens type 2 + 3 (97.6% and 98.9%, respectively),
   poliovirus type 1 (100% in each group), poliovirus type 2 (100% in each group),
   poliovirus type 3 (100% in each group).
           Noninferiority was achieved because the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for
30 the difference in proportion of responders between the bivalent rLP2086 + REPEVAX
   group (Group 1) and the REPEVAX alone group (Group 2), 1 month after the REPEVAX
   dose was greater than -0.10 (-10%) for the 9 antigens in REPEVAX (i.e., the lowest
   lower bound of the 95% CI on the proportion difference was -4.7% (pertussis toxoid).
   Hence, the immune response induced by REPEVAX given with bivalent rLP2086 was
35 noninferior to the immune response induced by REPEVAX alone.
                                                414

          The proportion of subjects with an hSBA titer LLOQ for each of the 4 primary
   MnB test strains for the Postvaccination 3 evaluable immunogenicity population was
   assessed. The LLOQ for A22 was an hSBA titer equal to 1:16 while the LLOQ for all
   the other MnB test stains was an hSBA titer equal to 1:8.
 5         For Group 1, the proportion of subjects with an hSBA titer LLOQ at baseline
   (before Vaccination 1) was 14.4% for primary MnB strain A22, 18.2% for A56, 12.7% for
   B24, and 6.2% for B44. For Group 2, the proportion of subjects with an hSBA titer
   >LLOQ at baseline (before Vaccination 1) was 23.0% for primary MnB strain A22,
   21.8% for A56, 12.9% for B24, and 6.3% for B44.
10         Substantial hSBA responses were observed among Group 1 subjects after Dose
   2 of bivalent rLP2086, with additional increases observed after 3 doses 1 month after
   Vaccination 3. For Group 1 (bivalent rLP2086 + REPEVAX), the proportion of subjects
   achieving an hSBA titer > LLOQ at 1 month after Vaccination 2 and at 1 month after
   Vaccination 3 was 81.1% and 95.6% for A22, 97.3% and 100% for A56, 81.0% and
15 96.8% for B24, and 55.5% and 81.5% for B44. While substantial hSBA responses were
   achieved after only two bivalent rLP2086 doses, the increase in the proportion of
   subjects with an hSBA titer > LLOQ after 2 doses (1 month after Vaccination 2)
   compared to 3 doses (1 month after Vaccination 3) exemplifies the enhancement of an
   immune response after 3 doses. In the control group (Group 2), the proportions of
20 subjects with an hSBA titer > LLOQ for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains at 1
   month after Vaccination 2 and 1 month after Vaccination 3 were similar to the baseline
   hSBA results for each MnB test strain (before Vaccination 1).
           For the 4 primary MnB test strains, the proportion of subjects in Group 1
   exhibiting a defined hSBA titer was greater after 3 doses than after 2 doses. Subjects
25 who achieved an hSBA titer of        1:16 are described, since this titer is a 4-fold increase
   from a 1:4 titer (a titer of 1:4 is widely recognized as the correlate of protection against
   IMD). For Group 1, the proportion of subjects with an hSBA titer of 1:16 at 1 month
   after Vaccination 2 was 81.8% for A22, 97.3% for A56, 68.0% for B24, and 53.4% for
   B44. One month after Vaccination 3, the proportion of subjects with an hSBA titer of
30  1:16 was 95.6% for A22, 100% for A56, 87.3% for B24, and 79.5% for B44.
           In the control group (Group 2), the proportions of subjects exhibiting defined
   hSBA titers for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains at 1 month after Vaccination 2
   and 1 month after Vaccination 3 were similar to the proportion of subjects with the
   defined hSBA titer at baseline (before Vaccination 1).

           For Group 1, the proportion of subjects with an hSBA titer of 1:16 following 3
   doses of bivalent rLP2086 demonstrated that the vaccine elicits a robust immune
   response when 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086 were administered.
           hSBA Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs). In general, the GMTs at baseline were
 5 below the hSBA LLOQs for both groups. For Group 1, hSBA GMTs at 1 month after
   Vaccination 2 were 35.5 for A22, 91.1 for A56, 15.9 for B24, and 14.6 for B44. The
   hSBA GMTs at 1 month after Vaccination 3 were 63.4 for A22, 151.5 for A56, 28.3 for
   B24, and 36.5 for B44.
           For Group 1, the observed GMTs after 2 doses for subfamily A strains, as well as
10 after 3 doses for subfamily B strains, were indicative of a robust immune response.
           Reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) showing the distribution of
   hSBA titers for A22, A56, B24, and B44 were assessed. Results from the RCDCs in
   Group 1 showed that substantial immune responses were observed among Group 1
   subjects after Vaccination 2 of bivalent rLP2086; however, the figures also showed the
15 benefit of a third dose of bivalent rLP2086 as greater proportion of subjects achieved
   higher titers against the 4 MnB test strains. The effect was most pronounced for strain
   B44.
   Conclusions: When given concomitantly with bivalent rLP2086, REPEVAX induced
   immune responses that were noninferior to those elicited by REPEVAX alone. The
20 bivalent rLP2086 vaccine induced robust bactericidal responses to four diverse MnB
   test strains, particularly to those representing subfamily B, that were greater after 3
   doses than 2 doses. Concomitant administration was generally safe and well tolerated.

EXAMPLE 5
Immunogenicity of an Investigational Meningococcal Serogroup B Bivalent
rLP2086 Vaccine in Healthy Adolescents
Background and Aims: Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MnB) causes invasive
disease in infants, adolescents, and adults. A conserved, surface-exposed lipoprotein,
LP2086 (a factor H binding protein [fHBP]), is a promising MnB vaccine target. Safety
and immunogenicity of an investigational bivalent, recombinant vaccine (rLP2086) were
studied in healthy adolescents (11-18 years).
Methods: Subjects in this placebo-controlled, single-blind study were randomized to
two 3-dose schedules and three 2-dose schedules. Each 120-pg dose contained 2
rLP2086 antigens, 1 from each LP2086 subfamily (A and B). Saline was given when
vaccine was not scheduled. Serum bactericidal assays using human complement
(hSBA) were performed with 4 MnB test strains (heterologous to vaccine fHBP).
Results: 1713 subjects (mean age, 14.4 y) were randomized. One month after 3 doses
of vaccine, hSBA titers 28 to subfamily A and B strains were observed in 95-99% and
86-89% of subjects, respectively; after 2 doses, these numbers ranged from 91-100%
and 69-77% of subjects, respectively. Of the 2-dose schedules, 0 and 6 months induced
the highest antibody responses (Table 1 of Example 5). hSBA GMTs after 2 doses
ranged from 6.2-125.6 and after 3 doses ranged from 25.6-155.6 across the 4 MnB
heterologous test strains. Mild-to-moderate injection site pain was the most common
local reaction. Fever 380C was experienced in 3.3-6.5% and 2.1% of rLP2086 and
saline recipients, respectively, after dose 1.

     Conclusions: rLP2086 as well Iterated. All dosing regimens yielded robust
     bactericidal responses that were most pronounced after 3 doses.
                Table 1 of Example 5 is the same as Table 1 of Example 1, described above.
     Table 2 summarizes the hSBA GMTs and the corresponding Cis by study time for the
     valuable immunoagenicity population. GMTs increased frm baseline (before Injection
     1) and continued to increase with each subsequent dose of bivalent rL-P2086.
                For the 4 primary Mn8 strains, the GM~s were greater after 3 doses of bivalent
     rLPD2086 (Groups 1 and 2) than after 2 doses (Groups 3, 4, and 5). The GMTs were
     similar between the two 3-doise groups, and they were similar among the three 2-dose
     groups.
                Before injection 1 (baseline), hSBA GMTs for Groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were as
     follows: 7.1, 6.3, 6.4, 6.4, and 6.8 for A2, respectively; 6.8, 6A1, 6.                                          6.3, and 6.2 for
     A56, respectively; 5.3, 5.1, 5.0, 4,9, and 5.1 for B24, respectively; and 4.                                            4.5, 4.5, 4.6,
     and 4.4 for B44, respectively.
                For Group 1 (0-, 1-, and 6-month), there was a substantial increase in GMITs
     noted 1 month after Dose 2 for all 4 primary MnB strains (24.4, 77.3, 13.8, and 13.1 fo
     A22, A56, B24, and B44, respectivelyy. The GMTs further increased after 3 doses of
                                                                            49

bivalent rLP2086 for Group 1 subjects for the 4 primary MnB test strains; 55.1 (A22);
 152.96 (A56); 29.1 (B24); and 40.3 (B44).
        For Group 2, similar increases in GMTs were noted after 2 and 3 doses of
bivalent rLP2086. GMTs for Group 2 subjects after 2 doses of bivalent rLP2086 were
32.9 for A22; 94.6 for A56; 14.9 for B24; and 15.5 for B44. After 3 doses, the GMTs
increased to 56.3 for A22; 155.6 for A56; 25.6 for B24; and 35.0 for B44.
        For Groups 1 and 2, the observed GMTs after 2 doses for subfamily A strains, as
well as after 3 doses for subfamily B strains, are indicative of a robust immune
response.
        For Group 3, small increases in GMTs were noted after 1 dose of bivalent
rLP2086 as follows: 12.0 for A22; 18.5 for A56; 9.2 for B24; and 5.7 for B44. After 2
doses GMTs increased to 48.4 for A22; 125.6 for A56; 20.6 for B24; and 22.5 for B44.
        For Group 4, GMTs were 13.3 for A22; 17.7 for A56; 9.8 for B24; and 5.9 for B44
after 1 dose of bivalent rLP2086. After 2 doses of bivalent rLP2086, GMTs were 37.1
for A22; 104.9 for A56; 17.7 for B24; and 19.1 for B44.
        For Group 5, GMTs after 1 dose of bivalent rLP2086 were 16.0 for A22; 26.8 for
A56; 12.6 for B24; and 6.8 for B44. After 2 doses of bivalent rLP2086, the GMTs
increased to 39.6 for A22; 111.8 for A56; 14.7 for B24; and 17.8 for B44.
       Taken together, for Groups 3, 4, and 5, the observed GMTs are indicative of an
immune response for subfamily A and B strains after 2 doses of bivalent rLP2086.
        In summary, 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086 provided a robust and the broadest
immune response based on the hSBA titers for the 4 primary MnB test strains. In
comparison to 2 doses, a higher proportion of subjects receiving 3 doses of bivalent
rLP2086 achieved an hSBA titer 1:8 to the 4 primary MnB test strains.
        The results following the 0-, 1-, and 6-month dosing schedule (Group 1) were
similar to the results following the 0-, 2-, and 6-month dosing schedule (Group 2). For
Groups 1 and 2, the post-Dose 3 GMT values achieved were higher than the post-Dose
2 GMT values. For Groups 1 and 2, the post-Dose 2 GMT values ranged from 24.4 to
94.6 for subfamily A strains and from 13.1 to 15.5 for subfamily B strains. The post
 Dose 3 GMT values ranged from 55.1 to 155.6 for subfamily A strains and from 25.6 to
40.3 for subfamily B strains. For Groups 1 and 2, a higher proportion of subjects
achieved an hSBA titer 21:8 to the 4 primary MnB test strains following 3 doses of
bivalent rLP2086 when compared to the proportion of subjects achieving an hSBA titer
>1:8 to the 4 primary MnB test strains after 2 doses of bivalent rLP2086.

        Subjects who achieved an hSBA titer of 1:16 were also assessed. For Group 1,
the percentage of subjects who achieved an hSBA titer of 1:16 one month after 2
doses of bivalent rLP2086 was 73.5% for A22; 96.3 for A56; 57.6 for B24; and 47.2%
for B44. Following 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086, the percentage of subjects in Group 1
who achieved an hSBA titer of 1:16 was 91.4% for A22; 99.2% for A56; 82.8% for B24;
and 84.8% for B44.
        For Group 2, the percentage of subjects who achieved an hSBA titer of 1:16
one month after 2 doses of bivalent rLP2086 was 88.1% for A22; 97.9% for A56; 63.5%
for B24; and 58.6% for B44. Following 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086, the percentage of
subjects in Group 2 who achieved an hSBA titer of 1:16 was 95.0% for A22; 98.9% for
A56; 83.6% for B24; and 83.8% for B44.
        For Groups 1 and 2, the percentage of subjects achieving an hSBA titer of 1:16
following 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086 demonstrated that the vaccine elicits a robust
immune response.
        For Group 3, the percentage of subjects who achieved an hSBA titer of 1:16
after 2 doses of bivalent rLP2086 was 93.2% for A22; 98.4% for A56; 73.8% for B24;
and 70.8% for B44.
        For Group 4, the percentage of subjects who achieved an hSBA titer of 1:16
one month after 2 doses of bivalent rLP2086 was 90.8% for A22; 99.2% for A56; 67.1%
for B24; and 64.5% for B44.
        For Group 5, the percentage of subjects who achieved an hSBA titer of 1:16
after 2 doses of bivalent rLP2086 was 91.0% for A22; 99.1% for A56; 64.5% for B24;
and 66.7% for B44.
        For Groups 3, 4, and 5, the percentage of subjects achieving an hSBA titer of
>1:16 demonstrated that the vaccine elicits a robust immune response to subfamily A
strains following only 2 doses. However, 3 doses increases the robustness of response
to subfamily B strains.
        The percentage of subjects achieving an hSBA titer of 1:16 after 3 doses of
bivalent rLP2086 shows that the vaccine elicits a robust and broad immune response to
MnB strains expressing LP2086 variants that are different from the vaccine
components.
        Reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) showing the distribution of
hSBA titers by study times were also assessed for the evaluable immunogenicity
populations for each strain by group. The RCDCs show robust immune responses after
2 doses of bivalent rLP2086 subfamily A strains. Following the third dose of bivalent
                                             1

rLP2086, the area under the response curves increases for all 4 primary MnB test
strains, thereby demonstrating the enhancement of the immune response after 3 doses
of bivalent rLP2086.
       The results from the primary and secondary immunogenicity endpoint analyses
show that the vaccine can generate antibodies with significant hSBA activity against
heterologous subfamily A and subfamily B variants of MnB. While the proportion of
subjects achieving an hSBA titer 1:8 was higher after 2 or 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086,
a large proportion of subjects achieved an hSBA titer 1:8 one month after 1 dose of
bivalent rLP2086. See Group 5 for example.
        For the 4 primary MnB test strains, the GMTs were greater after 3 doses of
bivalent rLP2086 (Groups 1 and 2) than after 2 doses (Groups 3, 4, and 5). The GMTs
were similar in the two 3-dose groups. The GMTs were also similar among the three 2
dose groups. These data also demonstrate robust hSBA responses after 3 doses of
bivalent rLP2086 based on the percentages of subjects achieving an hSBA titer 1:16.
        These data demonstrate that the final formulation of bivalent rLP2086 generates
a robust immune response and is safe and well tolerated when given in 2 or 3 doses.
Even 1 dose of bivalent rLP2086 provides a substantial immune response above
baseline and is also safe and well tolerated. Overall, there was no clinically meaningful
difference in the safety profile after 2 or 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086.

EXAMPLE 6
Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a Meningococcal Serogroup B
Bivalent rLP2086 Vaccine in Healthy Adolescents Aged 11 to 18 Years in
Three Phase 2, Randomized, Controlled Studies
Background: Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MnB) is a major cause of invasive
meningococcal disease in adolescents. A conserved, surface-exposed lipoprotein,
LP2086 (factor H binding protein [fHBP]), is a promising vaccine target to protect
against invasive disease caused by MnB. Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an
investigational bivalent, recombinant MnB vaccine (including SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID
NO: 2, 2.8 molar ratio polysorbate-80, 0.5 mg/ml aluminum, 10 mM histidine, and 150
mM sodium chloride, herein referred to throughout the Examples as "bivalent rLP2086")
were examined in three phase 2, randomized, controlled studies in healthy adolescents
11-18 years of age.
Methods: Study 1012 examined 5 vaccine regimens of bivalent rLP2086, whereas
studies 1010 and 1011 evaluated a 3-dose schedule of bivalent rLP2086 vaccine given
concomitantly with the TdaP-IPV and HPV-vaccines, respectively. Each dose of bivalent
rLP2086 contained 60 pg of the rLP2086 subfamily A variant A05 and 60 pg of the
rLP2086 subfamily B variant B01. To examine immunogenicity of bivalent rLP2086 in
each of the three studies, serum bactericidal assays using human complement (hSBA)
were performed with 4 MnB test strains expressing the heterologous fHBP variants A22,
A56, B24 and B44, which were selected to represent relevant diversity of fHBP
variability, as well as to provide a perspective on the breadth of the vaccine-elicited
immune response against strain expressing epidemiologically prevalent fHBP variants.
Adverse events and solicited local and systemic reactions were assessed.
Results: 82-100% of subjects in all 3 studies achieved hSBA titers above the lower
limit of quantification (LLOQ) for each of the 4 MnB test strains 1 month after dose 3
(Table). Across the three studies, the majority of systemic events and local reactions
were mild to moderate in severity; adverse events were generally not serious or related
to the study vaccine.
Conclusions: Serum bactericidal antibody titers above 1:4 protect against invasive
meningococcal disease. The demonstration of hSBA titers LLOQ to 4 MnB test strains,
each heterologous to vaccine antigen, in each of these adolescent phase 2 studies,
suggest that the bivalent rLP2086 vaccine provided a functional antibody response that

may be broadly active against diverse MnB disease-associated strains. Vaccinations
with the bivalent rLP2086 were generally well tolerated.

EXAMPLE 7
Immunogenicity of a Meningococcal Serogroup B Bivalent rLP2086 Vaccine
in Healthy Adolescents Aged 11 to 18 When Administered Concomitantly
With Human Papillomavirus Vaccine
        This Phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, controlled study evaluated the
immunogenicity of bivalent rLP2086 with or without coadministration with GARDASIL@,
which is a quadrivalent vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV4) (as also
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,820,870), in healthy adolescents 211 to <18 years of
age. GARDASIL contains recombinant antigens of HPV type 6, 11, 16, and 18 (i.e.,
HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18) Li protein. An endpoint was the hSBA GMTs
for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains at each applicable blood sampling time point.
Methods: Subjects received bivalent rLP2086 (including SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID
NO: 2, 2.8 molar ratio polysorbate-80, 0.5 mg/ml aluminum, 10 mM histidine, and 150
mM sodium chloride) + HPV4 (Group 1), bivalent rLP2086 + saline (Group 2), or HPV4
+ saline (Group 3) at months 0, 2, and 6. Sera from subjects in Groups 1 and 2 before
vaccination 1, and 1 month after vaccinations 2 and 3, were tested by serum
bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA) using 4 MnB test strains, each
expressing an fHBP (A22, A56, B44, and B24) that is heterologous to the vaccine
components and represents the breadth of fHBP diversity, as well as epidemiological
prevalence. Endpoints assessed included the proportion of subjects with hSBA titers
the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ; 1:16 [A22] or 1:8 [A56, B44, B24]) and hSBA
geometric mean titers (GMTs).
        To demonstrate noninferiority of administrating GARDASIL plus bivalent rLP2086
compared to GARDASIL alone, immunogenicity assessments were performed with 2
hSBAs, using 1 primary test strain representing subfamily A variants (A22) and 1
primary test strain representing subfamily B variants (B24). However, all 4 primary MnB
test strains were used for determination of additional bivalent rLP2086
immunogenicity/efficacy exploratory endpoints.
        For assessment of the immune response to bivalent rLP2086, functional
antibodies were analyzed in hSBAs with meningococcal serogroup B strains randomly
selected from Pfizer's representative MnB SBA strain pool, as described in Example 2.
The hSBAs measured the functional antibodies in human sera that in a complement
dependent manner kill the target meningococcal strain.

Results: 814 and 812 subjects included the evaluable immunogenicity population for
Groups 1 and 2, respectively. Compared with before vaccination 1, the proportion of
subjects with hSBA titers     LLOQ against all 4 test strains was higher after vaccinations
2 (55%-99%) and 3 (83%-99%; Figure 1). Table A of Example 7 presents the hSBA
GMTs for each of the 4 primary MnB strains and the corresponding Cis by sampling
time point for the evaluable immunogenicity population. The GMTs at baseline were
below the hSBA LLOQs for both groups. GMTs ranged from 11.1-70.6 and 11.9-76.3
after vaccination 1, and 25.8-117.2 and 28.0-128.2 after vaccination 2 in Groups 1 and
2, respectively (Table A below).
        For the evaluable immunogenicity population, the hSBA GMTs to the 2 primary
MnB strains at 1 month after the Vaccination 3 bivalent rLP2086 dose for Group 1 and
Group 2 were as follows: 53.3 and 57.8, respectively for A22 and 25.8 and 28.0,
respectively for B24.
        For Group 2 (bivalent rLP2086 + saline), hSBA GMTs at 1 month after
Vaccination 2 were 33.7 for A22, 76.3 for A56, 16.3 for B24, and 11.9 for B44. The
hSBA GMTs at 1 month after Vaccination 3 were 57.8 for A22, 128.2 for A56, 28.0 for
B24, and 31.9 for B44.
        For Group 1 (bivalent rLP2086 + GARDASIL), hSBA GMTs at 1 month after
Vaccination 2 were 31.9 for A22, 70.6 for A56, 15.0 for B24, and 11.1 for B44. The
hSBA GMTs at 1 month after Vaccination 3 were 53.3 for A22, 117.2 for A56, 25.8 for
B24, and 27.2 for B44.
        Reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) showing the distribution of
hSBA titers for A22, A56, B24, and B44 were assessed for Group 1 and Group 2 at all
sampling time points for the evaluable immunogenicity population. The RCDCs showed
that the majority of subjects responded after Vaccination 2 and had an additional
increase in titer for the 4 primary MnB test strains after Vaccination 3. Immune
responses to the antigens were similar for Groups 1 and 2.
Conclusions: Bivalent rLP2086 can be administered with HPV4 without affecting the
bactericidal response assessed by hSBA seroresponse or GMTs. Since hSBA titers
>1:4 correlate with protection against meningococcal disease, these data indicate the
potential for protection of adolescents against a broad range of MnB strains following
administration of the bivalent rLP2086 in the setting of concomitant administration of
HPV vaccine.

EXAMPLE 8
Immunogenicity of Human Papilloma Vaccine Coadministered with a
Bivalent rLP2086 Vaccine Against Meningococcal Serogroup B in Healthy
Adolescents
Background: This Phase 2, randomized study evaluated coadministration of a
quadrivalent vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV4), with bivalent rLP2086, an
investigational vaccine against invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis
serogroup B (MnB), in healthy adolescents      11 to <18 years of age.
Methods: Subjects received HPV4 + bivalent rLP2086 (Group 1), bivalent rLP2086 +
saline (Group 2), or saline + HPV4 (Group 3) at months 0, 2, and 6. Sera were collected
at baseline and after doses 2 and 3 in all groups. Immune responses to HPV4 antigens
(HPV-6, 11, 16, and 18) were determined by competitive LUMINEX immunoassays
(cLIAs). Bivalent rLP2086 immunogenicity was measured by serum bactericidal assay
using human complement (hSBA) with 2 MnB test strains expressing vaccine
heterologous fHBP variants (A22 and B24). Immunogenicity endpoints, all after dose 3,
included: geometric mean titers (GMTs) against HPV antigens in Groups 1 and 3; hSBA
GMTs for strains expressing variants A22 and B24 in Groups 1 and 2; and
seroconversion rate for HPV antigens in baseline seronegative subjects in Groups 1
and 3. Safety of bivalent rLP2086 was also assessed after concomitant administration
with HPV4 or saline.
        Assessments of the immune response to GARDASIL (HPV type 6, 11, 16, and
18 Li protein) were performed using cLIAs based on a fluorescently labeled
microsphere-based platform (LUMINEX). Sera obtained from all subjects in Groups 1
and 3 prior to the first vaccination with GARDASIL (Visit 1) and 1 month after the third
vaccination with GARDASIL (Visit 5) were used in these assays.
        The comparison of the GMTs to the 4 HPV antigens for Group 1 and Group 3,
with their corresponding GMT ratios (GMRs) of Group 1 to Group 3 and the 2-sided
95% CIs of the ratios is presented in Table A below of the present Example. The
criterion for the noninferiority margin was 1.5-fold, which corresponds to a value of 0.67
for the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the GMR. The 1.5-fold criterion of 0.67 was
met for all the MnB test strains and the HPV antigens except for HPV-18, which had a
lower bound 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.62. In a separate analysis, 99% of
subjects seroconverted to all 4 HPV antigens in both the Saline + HPV4 and rLP2086 +
HPV4 groups.

       Another objective of this study was to describe the immune response induced by
bivalent rLP2086 + GARDASIL (Group 1) and by saline + GARDASIL (Group 3), as
measured by seroconversion in the HPV immunogenicity assays after the Vaccination 3
dose of GARDASIL (Visit 5) in both groups.
       The seroconversion rate for each of the 4 HPV antigens, 1 month after the last
dose of GARDASIL for subjects who were HPV-seronegative at baseline in Group 1 and
Group 3, was calculated as the proportion of subjects with anti-HPV serum cLIA levels
>20 mMU/ml for HPV-6,       16 mMU/ml for HPV-11,      20 mMU/ml for HPV-16, and >24
mMU/ml for HPV-18.
       The number and proportion of baseline HPV-seronegative subjects achieving the
prespecified criteria for seroconversion for the 4 HPV antigens with the corresponding
95% CIs in each group, the percent differences (Group 1 - Group 3) in the proportion,
and the 95% CIs of the differences are presented in Table B of Example 8 for the
baseline HPV-seronegative evaluable immunogenicity population.
Results: The prespecified noninferiority criteria set at 1.5-fold (0.67 lower limit of 95%
CI for GMRs) were met for 3 of 4 HPV antigens (not HPV-1 8) and both MnB test strains
(Table A). Seroconversion rates in Groups 1 and 3 were 99% for all HPV antigens
(Table B). Greater local reactogenicity occurred after rLP2086 compared with saline but
did not increase with later doses; injection site pain was the most common local
reaction. Systemic events in all 3 groups were generally mild and moderate in severity.
       For the evaluable immunogenicity population, the GMTs of antibodies to the 4
HPV antigens at 1 month after the GARDASIL dose at Vaccination 3 for Group 1 and
Group 3 were as follows: 451.8 and 550.3, respectively (HPV-6); 892.9 and 1084.3,
respectively (HPV-11); 3695.4 and 4763.4, respectively (HPV-16); and 744.0 and
1047.4, respectively (HPV-18). The GMRs of Group 1 to Group 3 at 1 month after the
GARDASIL dose at Vaccination 3 were 0.82 for HPV-6 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.94), 0.82 for
HPV-11 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.91), 0.78 for HPV-16 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.88), and 0.71 for HPV
18 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.81). Therefore, the lower limits of the 2-sided 95% CIs for anti-HPV
GMRs for Group 1 compared with Group 3 were 0.72 for HPV-6, 0.74 for HPV-1 1, 0.68
for HPV-1 6, and 0.62 for HPV-1 8. The 1.5-fold criterion of 0.67 (the lower limit of the 2
sided 95% CI of the GMR) was met for all HPV antigens except for HPV-18, which had
a lower bound of the 95% CI of 0.62.
       The GMRs of the bivalent rLP2086 + GARDASIL group to the bivalent rLP2086 +
saline group at 1 month after the Vaccination 3 bivalent rLP2086 dose were 0.92 for
A22 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.00), and 0.92 for B24 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.01). The lower limits of the

2-sided 95% CIs for the hSBA GMRs for Group 1 compared with Group 2 were 0.85 for
A22 and 0.84 for B24, which are both greater than 0.67 and therefore met the
noninferiority margin of 1.5-fold.
        The data from bivalent rLP2086 + GARDASIL (Group 1) administration were
compared to data from the bivalent rLP2086 + saline (Group 2) administration by
analyzing the hSBA titer 4-fold response rates for 2 primary MnB strains (A22 and B24)
at 1 month after Vaccination 3        The proportions of subjects achieving 4-fold rise in
hSBA titer from baseline to 1 month after Vaccination 3 for the 2 primary MnB strains
were measured for both Group 1 subjects who received bivalent rLP2086 + GARDASIL
and Group 2 subjects who received bivalent rLP2086 + saline. Of the subjects in Group
1, 85.3% exhibited 4-fold rise in hSBA titers against B24. Of the subjects in Group 2,
86.4% exhibited 24-fold rise in hSBA titers against A22, and 84.8% exhibited 24-fold
rise in hSBA titers against B24.
        The difference in the proportion of responders between Group 1 and Group 2 at
1 month after Vaccination 3 was -1.1% for A22 (95% CI: -4.6, 2.3) and -1.4% for B24
(95% CI: -5.1, 2.3). The differences of 4-fold response rates were all near a value of
1%, with the lower bounds of the 95% CI of the proportion difference being -4.6% A22
and -5.1% B24.
        The noninferiority criteria of bivalent rLP2086 + GARDASIL compared to saline +
GARDASIL or compared to bivalent rLP2086 + saline required that the lower limit of the
2-sided 95% CIs for the GMRs for antibodies to HPV for all 4 HPV antigens (HPV-6,
HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18) and for hSBA titers using 2 primary MnB test strains
(A22 and B24) 1 month after Vaccination 3 be greater than 0.67. This prespecified
criterion was met for both MnB test strains and at least 3 of the 4 HPV antigens.     For
HPV-18, the lower limit of the 2-sided Cis for the GMR was slightly below the
prespecified threshold of 0.67, at 0.62.
        The 4-fold rise responses to 2 primary MnB test strains (A22 and B24) were
similar (ranged from 83.4% to 86.4%) between the group that received bivalent rLP2086
+ GARDASIL and the group that received bivalent rLP2086 + saline.
        The proportions of subjects in Groups 1 and 2 with prevaccination (i.e., before
Vaccination 1) hSBA titers of 1:4 were 15.2% and 18.8%, respectively, for strain A22;
10.4% and 10.5%, respectively, for strain A56; 6.1% and 8.4%, respectively, for strain
B24; and 1.7% and 3.2%, respectively for strain B44. In addition, the proportions of
subjects in Groups 2 and 1 with prevaccination hSBA titers of 1:16 were 13.7% and
                                                an

 16.4%, respectively for strain A22; 9.0% and 9.1%, respectively, for strain A56; 4.1%
and 5.4%, respectively, for strain B24; and 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively, for strain B44.
        In Group 2 (bivalent rLP2086 + saline), the proportion of subjects with an hSBA
titer 1:4 at 1 month after Vaccination 2 was 86.3% for A22, 98.7% for A56, 77.1% for
B24, and 60.1% for B44. One month after Vaccination 3, the proportion of subjects with
an hSBA titer of 1:4 was 96.4% for A22, 99.4% for A56, 92.8% for B24, and 86.5% for
B44. In Group 1 (bivalent rLP2086 + GARDASIL), the proportion of subjects with an
hSBA titer of 21:4 at 1 month after Vaccination 2 was 83.8% for A22, 97.8% for A56,
71.9% for B24, and 57.7% for B44. One month after Vaccination 3, the proportion of
subjects with an hSBA titer of 21:4 was 94.3% for A22, 99.1% for A56, 91.1% for B24,
and 84.4% for B44.
        In Group 2 (bivalent rLP2086 + saline), the proportion of subjects with an hSBA
titer 1:16 at 1 month after Vaccination 2 was 85.8% for A22, 98.4% for A56, 68.8% for
B24, and 49.9% for B44. One month after Vaccination 3, the proportion of subjects with
an hSBA titer of 1:16 was 96.3% for A22, 99.4% for A56, 89.2% for B24, and 82.4%
for B44. In Group 1 (bivalent rLP2086 + GARDASIL), the proportion of subjects with an
hSBA titer of 1:16 at 1 month after Vaccination 2 was 83.0% for A22, 97.2% for A56,
65.2% for B24, and 46.4% for B44. One month after Vaccination 3, the proportion of
subjects with an hSBA titer of 1:16 was 94.0% for A22, 98.9% for A56, 86.3% for B24,
and 78.0% for B44.
        For both Group 1 and Group 2, a high proportion of subjects achieved an hSBA
titer of 1:16 or greater following 2 or 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086, while most of the
subjects had no measureable hSBA titer to any of the primary MnB test strains at
prevaccination Visit 1.
        For the baseline HPV-seronegative evaluable immunogenicity population, the
proportion of subjects achieving the prespecified criteria for HPV seroconversion for the
HPV antigens at 1 month after the GARDASIL dose at Vaccination 3 for the bivalent
rLP2086 + GARDASIL group (Group 1) and the saline + GARDASIL group (Group 3)
were as follows: HPV-6 (99.4% and 99.3%, respectively), HPV-1 1 (99.6% and 99.5%,
respectively), HPV-16 (99.6% and 99.5%, respectively), and HPV-18 (99.5% and
99.0%, respectively).
        The difference in proportion of responders between the bivalent rLP2086 +
GARDASIL group (Group 1) and the saline + GARDASIL group (Group 3) at 1 month
after the GARDASIL dose was 0.1% for HPV-6 (95% Cl; -0.9, 1.5), 0.1% for HPV-11
                                             Ri

(95% CI: -0.7, 1.3), 0.1% for HPV-16 (95% CI; -0.7, 1.3), and 0.5% for HPV-18 (95% CI;
-0.6, 1.9).
        For the bivalent rLP2086 + GARDASIL group (Group 1) and the saline +
GARDASIL group (Group 3), the seroconversion rate differences were within 0.1% and
0.5% across all 4 HPV antigens and the seroconversion rates were very similar across
groups, with greater than 99% of subjects seroconverting for all 4 HPV antigens.
        As an additional evaluation, bivalent rLP2086 + GARDASIL (Group 1) was
compared to bivalent rLP2086 + saline (Group 2), by analyzing the hSBA titer 4-fold
response rates for 2 primary MnB strains (A22 and B24) at 1 month after Vaccination 3.
The proportions of subjects achieving an hSBA titer fold rise 24 from baseline to 1
month after Vaccination 3 for the 2 primary MnB strains are as follows: Of the subjects
in Group 1, 85.3% exhibited 24-fold rise in hSBA titers against test strain A22, and
83.4% exhibited 4-fold rise in hSBA titers against test strain B24. Of the subjects in
Group 2, 86.4% exhibited 4-fold rise in hSBA titers against test strain A22 and 84.8%
exhibited 4-fold rise in hSBA titers against test strain B24.
        The difference in the proportion of responders between Group 1 and Group 2 at
1 month after Vaccination 3 was -1.1% for A22 (95% CI:-4.6, 2.3) and -1.4% for B24
(95% CI: -5.1, 2.3). The differences of 4-fold response rate were all near a value of 1%,
with the lower bounds of the 95% CI of the proportion difference being -4.6% (A22) and
-5.1% (B24).
        Immune responses to bivalent rLP2086. Another objective of this study was to
describe the immune response as measured by hSBA performed with 4 primary MnB
test strains, 2 expressing LP2086 subfamily A proteins (A22 and A56) and 2 expressing
LP2086 subfamily B proteins (B24 and B44), measured 1 month after the second visit
(Visit 3) and the third (Visit 5) vaccinations with bivalent rLP2086.
        One of the endpoints for this objective was the proportion of subjects with hSBA
titers LLOQ at 1 month after Vaccination 2 (Visit 3) and at 1 month after Vaccination 3
(Visit 5) for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains. The proportion of subjects with
hSBA titer 2 LLOQ for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains for the evaluable
immunogenicity population was assessed. The LLOQ for A22 was an hSBA titer equal
to 1:16, while the LLOQ for all the other MnB test strains was an hSBA titer equal to 1:8.
        For Group 2 (bivalent rLP2086 + saline), the proportion of subjects with an hSBA
titer 2 LLOQ at baseline (before Vaccination 1) was 16.4% for A22, 9.3% for A56, 6.9%
for B24, and 2.5% for B44. For Group 2, the proportions of subjects achieving an hSBA
titer   LLOQ at 1 month after Vaccination 2 and at 1 month after Vaccination 3 were

85.8% and 96.3%, respectively, for A22; 98.5% and 99.4%, respectively, for A56; 74.2%
and 92.6%, respectively for B24; and 57.1% and 85.7%, respectively, for B44.
        For Group 1 (bivalent rLP2086 + GARDASIL), the proportion of subjects with an
hSBA titer    LLOQ at baseline (before Vaccination 1) was 13.7% for A22, 9.2% for A56,
5.1% for B24, and 1.4% for B44. For Group 1, the proportions of subjects achieving an
hSBA titer    LLOQ at 1 month after Vaccination 2 and at 1 month after Vaccination 3
were 83.0% and 94.0%, respectively, for A22; 97.5% and 98.9%, respectively, for A56;
70.6% and 90.5%, respectively for B24; and 54.5% and 82.7%, respectively, for B44.
        Substantial hSBA responses to the 4 primary MnB test strains were observed
among both Group 1 and Group 2 subjects at 1 month after Vaccination 2, with
additional increases observed at 1 month after Vaccination 3.
       The proportion of subjects achieving an hSBA titer fold rise 24 for each of the 4
primary MnB test strains and the proportions of subjects achieving the composite
response for the evaluable immunogenicity population were assessed. The proportions
of subjects with an observed hSBA titer LLOQ for all 4 MnB strains combined at
baseline (before Vaccination 1) were similar between Group 1 (0.3%) and Group 2
(0.7%).
        For Group 2 (bivalent rLP2086 + saline), the proportion of subjects achieving an
hSBA titer fold rise 4 from baseline to 1 month after Vaccination 3 was 86.4% for A22,
95.3% for A56, 84.8% for B24, and 80.7% for B44, and 83.9% of subjects achieved a
composite hSBA response (hSBA > LLOQ for all 4 primary strains combined). At 1
month after Vaccination 2, the proportion of subjects achieving an hSBA titer fold rise 24
from baseline was 74.2% for A22, 92.6% for A56, 63.4% for B24, and 47.4% for B44,
and 51.9% of subjects achieved a composite hSBA response.
        For Group 1 (bivalent rLP2086 + saline), the proportion of subjects achieving an
hSBA titer fold rise 4 from baseline to 1 month after Vaccination 3 was 86.4% for A22,
95.3% for A56, 84.8% for B24, and 80.7% for B44, and 83.9% of subjects achieved a
composite hSBA response (hSBA > LLOQ for all 4 primary strains combined). At 1
month after Vaccination 2, the proportion of subjects achieving an hSBA titer fold rise 24
from baseline was 74.2% for A22, 92.6% for A56, 63.4% for B24, and 47.4% for B44,
and 51.9% of subjects achieved a composite hSBA response.
       Additional hSBA fold response. Other endpoints were the proportion of
subjects achieving at least 2-fold and 3-fold hSBA titer increases from baseline to each
postvaccination blood sampling visit for each of the 4 primary MnB strains. Note that

the LLOQ for A22 was an hSBA titer equal to 1:16, while the LLOQ for all the other MnB
test strains was an hSBA titer equal to 1:8.
         The proportion of subjects achieving a 2-fold rise in hSBA titer from baseline to
1 month after Vaccination 2 for Group 1 and Group 2 for MnB strains were 77.3% and
81.1%, respectively, for A22; 94.4% and 95.3%, respectively, for A56; 63.0% and
66.0%, respectively, for B24; and 46.1% and 48.6%, respectively, for B44. The
proportions of subjects achieving an hSBA titer fold rise 2 from baseline to 1 month
after Vaccination 3 for Group 1 and Group 2 for MnB strains were 90.2% and 92.8%,
respectively, for A22; 97.2% and 97.9%, respectively, for A56; 84.6% and 87.2%,
respectively, for B24; and 77.7% and 81.7%, respectively, for B44.
         The proportions of subjects achieving an hSBA titer fold rise 23 from baseline to
1 month after Vaccination 2 for Group 1 and Group 2 for MnB strains were 73.1% and
74.2%, respectively, for A22; 92.5% and 92.6%, respectively, for A56; 61.3% and
63.4%, respectively, for B24; and 45.7% and 47.4%, respectively, for B44. The
proportions of subjects achieving an hSBA titer fold rise 3 from baseline to 1 month
after Vaccination 3 for Group 1 and Group 2 for MnB strains were 85.3% and 86.4%,
respectively, for A22; 95.0% and 95.3%, respectively, for A56; 83.4% and 84.8%,
respectively, for B24; and 77.0% and 80.7%, respectively, for B44.
         In summary of the descriptive endpoints under the objectives, the majority of
subjects achieved an hSBA titer > LLOQ for both Group 1 (bivalent rLP2086 +
GARDASIL) and group 2 (bivalent rLP2086 + saline) for all 4 primary MnB test strains,
while only a very small proportion of subjects had measurable hSBA titers > LLOQ at
baseline (prevaccination Visit 1). Substantial immune responses with the 4 MnB strains
were observed at 1 month after Vaccination 2, with additional increases observed at 1
month after Vaccination 3 for both Group 1 and Group 2 subjects. This conclusion was
confirmed by the proportion of subjects with an hSBA titer of 1:16 following 3 doses,
the observed GMTs achieved after 2 doses and after 3 doses in both groups, and the
RCDCs for the 4 primary MnB test strains.
         For both Group 1 and Group 2, a high proportion of subjects achieved an hSBA
titer fold rise >4 for each of the primary MnB test strains and a composite hSBA
response       LLOQ for all 4 primary MnB strains after the third study vaccination.
         In addition, the majority of subjects achieved an hSBA titer fold rise 3 and an
hSBA titer fold rise 22 for the 4 primary MnB strains at all sampling time points for both
Group 1 (bivalent rLP2086 + GARDASIL) and Group 2 (bivalent rLP2086 + saline). The

proportion of subjects with results meeting these criteria was higher after 3 vaccinations
compared with 2 vaccinations.
        These results support the evidence that the immune response to bivalent
rLP2086 when coadministered with the HPV vaccine, GARDASIL, yields a robust
immune response that is comparable to the immune response to bivalent rLP2086 +
saline.
        HPV GMTs. Table B of Example 8 presents the GMTs and the corresponding
Cis for each of the 4 HPV antigens at 1 month after Vaccination 3 for Group 1 (bivalent
rLP2086 + GARDASIL) and Group 3 (saline + GARDASIL) in the evaluable
immunogenicity population.
        For Group 3, the HPV GMTs at baseline (before Vaccination 1) and at 1 month
after Vaccination 3 were 6.0 and 550.3, respectively, for HPV-6; 4.3 and 1084.3,
respectively, for HPV-11; 6.1 and 4763.4, respectively, for HPV-16; and 5.3 and 1047.4,
respectively, for HPV-18. For Group 1 (bivalent rLP2086 + GARDASIL), the HPV GMTs
at baseline (before Vaccination 1) and at 1 month after Vaccination 3 were 5.8 and
451.8, respectively for HPV-6; 4.2 and 892.9, respectively, for HPV-1 1; 5.8 and 3695.4,
respectively, for HPV-16; and 5.2 and 744.0, respectively, for HPV-18. Overall, the
GMTs were numerically higher for Group 3 compared with Group 1. Reverse
cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) showing the distribution of titers for HPV-6,
HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18 were assessed for Group 1 (bivalent rLP2086 +
GARDASIL) and Group 3 (saline + GARDASIL) at all sampling time points for the
evaluable immunogenicity population. The RCDCs showed robust immune responses
among subjects after Vaccination 3 for both Group 1 and Group 3.
        Summary of Immune response to GARDASIL. The GMTs to HPV antigens
were numerically higher for Group 3 (saline + GARDASIL) as compared with Group 1
(bivalent rLP2086 + GARDASIL), and the observed HPV GMTs after Vaccination 3
were indicative of a robust immune response for both groups. RCDCs also supported
robust immune responses after Vaccination 3 for both Group 1 and Group 3. This was
also supported by the proportion of subjects with seropositive status for the 4 HPV
antigens, which was >99% at 1 month after Vaccination 3 for both groups. The younger
age subgroup had higher HPV GMTs in Group 3 (saline + GARDASIL) than the older
age subgroup. This difference was maintained when GARDASIL was given
concomitantly with bivalent rLP2086.
        Immunogenicity Conclusions. The noninferiority criteria of bivalent rLP2086      _
GARDASIL compared to saline + GARDASIL or compared to bivalent rLP2086 + saline

required that the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CIs for the geometric mean titer ratios
(GMRs) for antibodies to HPV for all 4 HPV antigens (HPV-6, HPV-1 1, HPV-1 6, and
HPV-18) and for hSBA titers using 2 primary MnB test strains (A22 and B24) 1 month
after Vaccination 3 be greater than 0.67. This prespecified threshold was met for both
MnB strains and 3 of the 4 HPV antigens. For HPV-18, the lower limit of the 2-sided
95% CIs for the GMR was slightly below the prespecified threshold of 0.67, at 0.62.
        Seroconversion for all 4 HPV antigens was achieved by 99% or more of the
subjects for the groups that received GARDASIL concomitantly with bivalent rLP2086 or
with saline. The RCDCs for all 4 HPV antigens show that the majority of subjects
achieved a response above the seroconversion threshold at 1 month after Vaccination
3. Robust GMTs relative to baseline were observed for both groups that received
GARDASIL.
        The 4-fold rise responses to 2 primary MnB test strains (A22 and B24) were
similar (ranged from 83.4% to 86.4%) between the group that received bivalent rLP2086
+ GARDASIL (85.3% and 83.4%, respectively) and the group that received bivalent
rLP2086 + saline (86.4% and 84.8%, respectively).
        Further descriptive analyses of the response to bivalent rLP2086 were performed
using 4 primary MnB test strains (A22, A56, B24, and B44). A high proportion of
subjects achieved an hSBA titer fold rise 4 and the composite response (all 4 primary
MnB test strains and the same immunogenicity/efficacy endpoint definition as used in
the Phase 3 clinical program) for the evaluable immunogenicity population for both
groups that received bivalent rLP2086, either concomitantly with GARDASIL (bivalent
rLP2086 + GARDASIL) or with saline (bivalent rLP2086 + saline), 1 month after
Vaccination 2 or 3. These responses are substantially higher than an hSBA titer 21:4
that has been demonstrated to correlate with protection against meningococcal disease
including serogroup B disease. These results also indicate and support the evidence of
a robust immune response to bivalent rLP2086 whether administered with saline or
concomitantly with GARDASIL.
Conclusions: Data indicate that robust immune responses to both vaccines were
generated after concomitant administration of rLP2086 + HPV4. Prespecified
noninferiority criteria were met for 5 of 6 antigens. Although GMRs to HPV-18 narrowly
missed noninferiority criteria, the high proportion of responders ( 99%) indicates clinical
effectiveness is expected to be maintained after concomitant administration. Bivalent
rLP2086 was well tolerated and elicited a robust immune response to test strains
expressing fHBPs heterologous to those in the vaccine.

EXAMPLE 9: BIVALENT RLP2086 VACCINE EFFICACY
        The efficacy of bivalent rLP2086 has been inferred using hSBA responses as the
surrogate of efficacy and demonstration of serum bactericidal antibody responses to
invasive N. meningitidis serogroup B (MnB) strains.
        Four MnB strains, representative of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD)
causing strains, were used in the evaluation. Each MnB test strain expresses an fHBP
protein variant (A22, A56, B24 or B44) that is heterologous (differs) from the vaccine
components (A05 and B01).
        The efficacy of bivalent rLP2086 was assessed in 3 randomized controlled Phase
II studies conducted in 4,459 adolescents aged 11 through 18 years of age in the US
and Europe. See also Example 6. A total of 2,293 received at least 1 dose of 120 pg of
bivalent rLP2086 using a 0-, 2-, and 6-month vaccination schedule. Efficacy was
assessed by evaluating hSBA immune responses in subjects vaccinated with bivalent
rLP2086.
        Efficacy was inferred using 5 co-primary immunogenicity endpoints. For 4 of the
5 co-primary endpoints, pre-specified proportions of subjects had to achieve 4-fold rises
in hSBA titer to each of the 4 MnB test strains following 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086.
The fifth co-primary endpoint was a composite endpoint requiring that a prespecified
high proportion of subjects each respond in all 4 hSBAs with the primary MnB test
strains following 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086. Immune response was also assessed
based on the proportion of subjects who achieved an hSBA titer > the lower limit of
quantitation (LLOQ) 1 month after the third dose of vaccine. LLOQ is defined as the
lowest amount of the antibody in a sample that can be measured.
        Study 1 (described in Example 7 and Example 8) was a Phase II, randomized,
active-controlled, observer-blinded, multicenter trial in which 2,499 US subjects, 11
through 17 years of age, were randomly assigned (in a 2:2:1 ratio) to 1 of 3 groups:
Group 1 received bivalent rLP2086 + HPV4, Group 2 received bivalent rLP2086 +
Saline, and Group 3 received Saline + HPV4. All vaccinations were administered on a
0-, 2-, and 6-month schedule.
        Study 2 (described in Example 4) was a Phase II, randomized, placebo
controlled, single-blind trial in which 753 European subjects, 11 through 18 years of age,
were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 2 groups: Group 1 received bivalent rLP2086
at 0-, 2-, and 6-months and dTaP-IPV (diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis
inactivated polio virus) at Month 0. Group 2 received Saline at 0-, 2-, and 6-months and
dTaP-IPV at Month 0.

        Study 3 (described in Example 5) was a Phase II, randomized, placebo
controlled, single-blind, multicenter trial in which 1,713 European subjects, 11 through
18 years of age, were randomly assigned in a 3:3:3:2:1 ratio to 5 groups. Subjects
received 2 or 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086 administered on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month
schedule (Group 1); on a 0-, 2-, and 6-month schedule (Group 2); on a 0- and 6-month
schedule (Group 3); on a 0- and 2-month schedule (Group 4); or on a 0- and 4-month
schedule (Group 5). Saline injections (1 or 2 doses depending on group) were
administered in each group to maintain the blind.
        Results in Studies 1, 2, and 3 among subjects who received a 3-dose series of
bivalent rLP2086 at 0-, 2-, and 6-months are described above in the respective
Examples 4-8. Evaluation of the 4-fold and composite response rates were exploratory
endpoints for all studies. The 4-fold response rates showed that the lower bounds of the
95% Confidence Interval (CI) for all 4 endpoints were similar among the 3 studies and
consistently met the threshold limits for the Phase III endpoints. The proportion of
subjects achieving hSBA titer > LLOQ was similar across the 3 studies.
        Based on the hSBA data acquired following 2 administrations of the vaccine
given 1 or 2 months apart, 2 doses of vaccine administered over these intervals may
provide protection to individuals at increased risk, due to potential exposure to a case of
meningococcal serogroup B disease. The responses observed after 2 vaccine
administrations delivered 1 or 2 months apart showed that a proportion of subjects
expressed hSBA levels equal to or above the LLOQ values for each of the 4 primary
test strains (see Study 1 results for Group 1 and Group 2; see Study 2 results for Group
1; see Study 3 results for Group 2). A third dose of the vaccine, administered at 6
months, can achieve vaccine-mediated protection.
        Concomitant Vaccine Administration. Study 1 (described in Example 7 and
Example 8) evaluated the concomitant use of bivalent rLP2086 and HPV4 in US
adolescents. The study endpoints included noninferiority assessment of the immune
response for the four HPV4 antigens (based on geometric mean titer [GMT]) and for
bivalent rLP2086 (based on hSBA using two MnB test strains [variants A22 and B24]) 1
month after the third vaccination. HPV4 immune response was also evaluated by
seroconversion for each of the 4 HPV antigens.
        Study 1 shows the comparison of the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of the
antibodies to HPV antigens for Group 1 (bivalent rLP2086 + HPV4) and Group 3 (Saline
+ HPV4), with their corresponding GMT ratio (GMRs) between Group 1 and Group 3
and the 2-sided 95% CIs of the ratios. Study 1 also provides the comparison of hSBA
                                                70

GMTs to the 2 primary MnB test strains for Group 1 and Group 2 with their
corresponding GMRs between Group 1 and Group 2 and the 2-sided 95% CI of the
ratios. The criterion for noninferiority margin was 1.5-fold, which corresponds to a value
of 0.67 for the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the GMR. The 1.5-fold criterion of
0.67 was met for all the MnB test strains and the HPV antigens except for HPV-18,
which had a lower bound 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.62. Although the response
to HPV-18 did not meet the pre-specified noninferiority criterion, the difference was
marginal. In a separate analysis, 99% of subjects seroconverted to all 4 HPV antigens
in both the Saline + HPV4 and bivalent rLP2086 + HPV4 groups.

EXAMPLE 10:
Bivalent rLP2086 Elicits Antibodies in Individuals That Provide Broad
Coverage Against MnB Strains Expressing Prevalent and Outbreak
Associated fHBP Variants
        Bactericidal antibodies measured in serum bactericidal assays using human
complement (hSBAs) have been correlated with protection from meningococcal disease
and hSBA responses have been used routinely as surrogates of vaccine efficacy.
Global epidemiological studies of fHBP diversity revealed that -80% of meningococcal
disease is caused by strains that express one of 10 prevalent fHBP variants.
Methods: hSBA responses to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MnB) strains
expressing the 10 most prevalent fHBP variants in the US and Europe (B24, B16, B44,
A22, B03, B09, A12, A19, A05 and A07) in individual human subjects immunized with
bivalent rLP2086 were evaluated. MnB strains expressing these ten most prevalent
variants represent the breadth of fHBP diversity, including 5 of the 6 major fHBP
subgroups, that are representative of > 98% and 97% of strains (by subgroup) in
the MnB SBA strain pool, and US subset of the MnB SBA strain pool, respectively.
Twenty-three MnB test strains were obtained from Pfizer's MnB SBA strain pool
(N=1263) that represent strains systematically collected from the US and Europe
between the years 2000 and 2006. In addition, isolates from recent MnB disease
outbreaks were included in the analysis. Matched prevaccination and postvaccination
sera (postdose 2 and postdose 3) were obtained randomly from adolescent and young
adult subjects enrolled in clinical studies B1971005, B1971012 or B1971003.
        To provide additional information supporting the potential coverage afforded by
vaccination with bivalent rLP2086, hSBAs were performed with the outbreak strains and
serum samples from nine subjects immunized with bivalent rLP2086 (clinical study
B1971012, described in Example 5 and Example 6. The subjects (11 to <19 years of
age) had received 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086 at 0, 2 and 6 months. To ensure a
conservative hSBA assessment the nine subjects were selected in a non-biased
manner from a set of subjects with no baseline hSBA activity against the primary MnB
test strains. Two of the clonal Princeton University outbreak strains (PMB5021 and
PMB5025) and two of the UCSB outbreak strains (one from each of the two genetic
clusters, PMB4478 and PMB4479, were tested.
        Genetic characterization of the clonal Princeton University MnB Outbreak Strains
is as follows: data suggest that the Princeton University outbreak strains are clonal.
                                             79

Each of the strains was typed as CC41/44 (ST 409) and expressed fHBP variant B153
(SEQ ID NO: 6). The strains had identical allele assignments for NHBA (2), porA
(subtype P1.5-1,2-2) and porB (3-82), all were null for nadA, and all had the same
pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profile (429).
        Genetic characterization of the 2013 University of California Santa Barbara
Outbreak Strains is as follows: The UCSB strains were typed as CC32(ET5; ST32),
expressed fHBP variant B24, and are related to the Oregon clone that has been
associated with hyperendemic serogroup B disease since 1993. Unlike the Princeton
outbreak group of strains, the UCSB strains segregated genetically into two distinct
clusters that were differentiated by their PFGE profile (468 or 467) and porB type (3-461
or 3-24). The strains had identical allele assignments for NadA (1), NHBA (5), porA
(subtype P1.7,16-20)
        hSBA titers at baseline for all subjects and all outbreak strains were < 4,
indicating that the subjects had no protective antibodies to any of the outbreak strains
prior to immunization with bivalent rLP2086.
Results: All 23 MnB strains were susceptible in hSBA with sera from individual
subjects immunized with bivalent rLP2086. Strains representing all 10 prevalent fHBP
variants as well as additional strains were all killed by hSBA. Baseline hSBA
seroprotection rates (proportions of subjects achieving hSBA titers >1:4) were generally
low. The lower seroprotective rates observed in subjects before immunization with
bivalent rLP2086 exemplify the vulnerability of a non-vaccinated adolescent or young
adult population to MnB disease. However, robust seroprotection rates were observed
in adolescents and young adults with postvaccination sera: seroprotection rates >70%
were observed for 83% of these strains depending on MnB strains and population
tested. Postvaccination seroprotection rates for strains expressing the most prevalent
subfamily A and B fHBP variants, B24 and A22, ranged from 81.0% to 100%, and
77.8% to 100% for recent outbreak strains expressing fHBP variants B24 and B153.
Furthermore, robust postdose 2 responses (compared to baseline) to all outbreak
strains were observed in these subjects, ranging from 56 to 89% depending on the
outbreak strain used in the hSBA.      In contrast, prevaccination seroprotective rates were
low, or not detectable, for recent US outbreak strains. The hSBA responses to the
Princeton University and UCSB outbreak strains are shown in FIG. 2.
Conclusions: Bivalent rLP2086 elicits robust seroprotective hSBA responses in
individuals to diverse invasive MnB strains expressing prevalent fHBPs in the US and
Europe, as well as newly emerging variants (B153)(SEQ ID NO: 6). The proportion of

subjects that showed a seroprotective response after immunization with bivalent
rLP2086 greatly exceeded the proportion of subjects that was seroprotected at baseline.
The data support that bivalent rLP2086 has the potential to provide broad protection of
adolescents and young adults from invasive meningococcal serogroup B disease,
including disease from recent outbreaks.
