ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
        A lead-acid battery grid made from a lead-based alloy containing tin, calcium,
bismuth and copper and characterized by enhanced mechanical properties, corrosion
resistance, less battery gassing, lower sulfation and water loss, and no post-casting treatment
requirements for age hardening. In one embodiment, the battery grids are formed from a
lead-based alloy including about 2.0% tin, about 0.0125% copper, about 0.065% calcium, and
about 0.032% bismuth. Preferably, the battery grid is free of silver beyond trace levels in the
alloy.

           LEAD-ACID BATTERY POSITIVE PLATE AND ALLOY THEREFORE
         [0001] The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent
Application No. 2013323563, the entire disclosure of which are incorporated herein by
reference.
FIELD
         [0001a] The present disclosure relates to lead-acid batteries, and more particularly, to
         alloys for battery grids.
BACKGROUND
         [0002] Lead-acid batteries are standard on most types of transportation vehicles
including microhybrid vehicles. For example, lead-acid batteries are used to start the internal
combustion engines of automobiles, trucks, and other equipment and to supply electricity for
vehicle accessories. These battery requirements are known in the industry as SLI (Starting,
Lighting and Ignition). Lead-acid batteries are also used in industrial stationary applications
including emergency lighting and power supply systems with battery backup such as data
networks, high-speed data transmission networks, wireless communication and cable TV
systems.
         [0003] There are two basic types of lead-acid battery designs: conventional flooded
lead-acid and sealed Valve Regulated Lead-Acid (VRLA). VRLA batteries are sometimes
referred to as an absorbed glass mat (AGM) battery. The performance requirements for these
two types of lead-acid batteries vary significantly. It is well known that lead-acid batteries
enjoy the best price/performance ratio for all energy storage devices available today.
         [0004] Stationary applications are generally float applications, i.e., the cells are
generally on float (i.e., an external voltage supply connected to the cells is held slightly above
the cell potential to maintain charge), with an occasional need for a deep discharge when the
main power source fails or is otherwise interrupted.
         [0005] Other applications require repetitive deep discharges, down to a 80% depth of
discharge or even somewhat greater. Suitable cells must thus be capable of enduring
repetitive charge-deep discharge-charge cycling regimes for up to 500 cycles or even more.
Indeed, it would be desirable to provide cells capable of enduring from 1,000 to 2,000 cycles
or so.
                                                 I

         [0006] Developing grid alloys that adequately satisfy the diverse requirements is
difficult because stringent criteria must be satisfied regardless of the type of application.
Suitable alloys must be capable of being cast into satisfactory grids and must impart adequate
mechanical properties to the grid. Also, the alloys must impart satisfactory electrical
performance to the cell in the intended application. Satisfactory alloys thus must impart the
                                                 la

    WO 2014/052528                                                          PCT/US2013/061826
desired corrosion resistance, not result in thermal runaway (i.e., must not raise the tendency
for the cell to lose water via gassing) and avoid premature capacity loss (sometimes referred
to as "PCL").
         [0007] More particularly, suitable alloys must be capable of being cast into grids by
the desired technique, i.e., the cast grids must be low in defects as is known (e.g., relative
freedom from voids, tears, microcracks and the like). Such casting techniques range from
conventional gravity casting ("book molds" or the like) to continuous processes using
expanded metal techniques. Alternatively, grids may be punched.
         [0008] The resulting grids need to be strong enough to endure processing into plates
and assembly into cells in conventionally used equipment. Even further, suitable grids must
maintain satisfactory mechanical properties throughout the expected service life. Any
substantial loss in the desired mechanical properties during service life can adversely impact
upon the cell performance as will be more fully discussed hereinafter.
         [0009] Considering now the electrochemical performance required, the grid alloy for
positive plates must yield a cell having adequate corrosion resistance. Yet, the use of a
continuous direct casting process, for example, which may be desirable from the standpoint
of economics, ostensibly can compromise corrosion resistance. Such continuous processes
thus orient the grains in the grids, thereby making the intergranular path shorter and more
susceptible to corrosion attack and to early failures.
         [0010] Positive grid corrosion thus is a primary mode of failure of VRLA lead-acid
cells. When positive grid corrosion occurs, this lowers the electrical conductivity of the cell
itself. Cell failure occurs when the corrosion-induced decrease in the conductivity of the grid
causes the discharge voltage to drop below a value acceptable for a particular application.
         [0011] A second failure mechanism, also associated with grid corrosion, involves
failure due to "grid growth." During the service life of a lead-acid cell, the positive grid
corrodes; and the corrosion products form on the surface of the grid. In most cases, the
corrosion products form at the grain boundaries and grid surface of the lead-acid where the
corrosion process has penetrated the interior of the "wires" of the grid. These corrosion
products are generally much harder than the lead alloy forming the grid and are less dense.
Due to the stresses created by these conditions, the grid alloy moves or grows to
accommodate the bulky corrosion products. This physical displacement of the grid causes an
increase in the length and/or width of the grid. The increase in size of the grid may be
nonuniform. A corrosion-induced change in the dimension of the grid may also sometimes
be called "creep".
                                                 2

    WO 2014/052528                                                           PCT/US2013/061826
         [0012] When grid growth occurs, the movement and expansion of the grid begins to
break the electrical contact between the positive active material and the grid itself This
movement and expansion prevents the passage of electricity from some reaction sites to the
grid and thereby lowers the electrical discharge capacity of the cell. As this grid growth
continues, more of the positive active material becomes electrically isolated from the grid and
the discharge capacity of the cell decays below that required for the particular application.
The mechanical properties of the alloy thus are important to avoid undue creep during service
life.
         [0013] Still further, and importantly, the use of the alloys must not result in thermal
runaway. VRLA cells must avoid conditions in service in which the temperature within the
cell increases uncontrollably and irreversibly. It has been hypothesized that excessive water
loss resulting in cell dry-out is the driving mechanism for thermal runaway in VRLA cells.
This water loss can be caused by hydrogen gassing at the negative electrode or oxygen
gassing at the positive electrode through the electrolysis of water, or both.
         [0014] As the water content and thus the cell saturation is reduced, the oxygen
recombination efficiency is increased. Since this recombination reaction is highly exothermic,
this tends to heat the cell. As the temperature rises, the cell tends to generate gas; and the
recombination processes become even more efficient, thereby further increasing the cell
temperature. In similar fashion, water loss increases the cell electrical resistance; and such
increased cell resistance increases the cell temperature, thereby further increasing water loss.
The cell is in thermal runaway.
         [0015] Accordingly, to avoid alloys that will push cells into thermal runaway, the
effect of the alloy and its constituents on gassing at both electrodes must be taken into
consideration. As is well known, antimonial alloys have been considered necessary for
positive grids where the cells are required in service to endure deep discharge-charge cycling
regimes. Yet, in general, although not exclusively, antimonial alloys cause thermal runaway
in VRLA cells due to excessive gassing at both electrodes. Antimony thus leaches out from
the positive grid as corrosion takes place, dissolving into the electrolyte, ultimately migrating
to and "electroplating" onto the negative electrode. These antimony sites on the negative
electrode thus become preferential to hydrogen gassing. Additionally, the presence of
antimony on the negative electrode increases the self-discharge and thereby heats the cell
since the self-discharge current is also reflected in the float current.
         [0016] Poisoning of the positive electrode, of course, also must be avoided. Undue
gassing at the positive electrode can thus lead to thermal runaway.
                                                  3

         [0017] Further, the alloys must maintain adequate contact for electrical conductance
throughout the desired service life. Otherwise, the cell will experience what has been termed
as "premature capacity loss" ("PCL). PCL can also occur through loss of contact due to
cracking of the corrosion layer or from a nonconductive film generated in the corrosion layer.
Because of the complexity and the substantial potential adverse effects, this is a difficult
criteria to achieve in combination with the other necessary criteria.
         [0018] It would also be desirable to provide positive grid alloys capable of enduring
deep discharge-charge cycling regimes. Satisfying these criteria would also allow use of such
alloys for both motive power and stationary VRLA applications.
         [0019] Lead sulfate (PbSO 4) crystals on the plates are formed as batteries discharge.
These crystals become relatively difficult to charge if the plates are left in the discharged
state or at open circuit for a significant period of time. Moreover, the fluid in a battery tends
to evaporate over time to such an extent that upper edges of battery plates become exposed
that they become susceptible to corrosion. This corrosion of the plates, especially positive
plates, further deteriorates the ability of a battery to be recharged and hold a charge.
         [0020] In some prior batteries and, in particular, industrial batteries, MFX (PbSbCd)
is the main alloy for the positive grids. MFX is robust and has good mechanical properties
and excellent corrosion resistance. However, this alloy contains Cd, which causes
environmental and recycling issues. Therefore, the use of Cd-containing alloys is restricted
globally because of environmental concerns.
         [0021] Alloy A (PbSnCaAg) is a replacement for MFX and is used extensively in
current production. It performs well in the BCI cycle life test, but overall it does not fully
match the performance of MFX. The addition of Ag increases the general corrosion
resistance but also increases cost and creates adhesion issues between the grids and PAM
(Positive Active Materials). In particular, it shows PCL at the high rate discharge test.
         [0022] It would be desirable to provide a new alloy for a battery grid that adequately
satisfies the diverse requirements needed for making battery grids for positive plates and, in
particular, is cheaper and performs better than current Alloy A.

SUMMARY
         [0023] The disadvantages of the prior art may be alleviated by the present lead-acid
battery that applies battery design features that protects the battery from permanent deep
discharge damage and promotes charge acceptance during float applications. In exemplary
embodiments, a unique combination of battery materials that are applied in unique
proportions have been found by experimentation to enable the battery to better hold a charge
during float operations. The proportions and ratio at which these exemplary materials are
applied are unique.
         [0024] Exemplary embodiments of the invention also use certain materials and/or
material characteristics that are unique either in their use or in their amount. By maintaining
a unique ratio of materials related to the positive grid metal alloy, a battery of the present
invention exhibits superior performance for long periods of time. The optimal materials and
their proportions and ratios of use are disclosed in detail in the body of this specification.
These unique exemplary materials used in unique proportions and percentages, in
combination with conventional materials, have by experimentation been found to provide
cumulatively an advantageous lead-acid battery that overcomes problems that have plagued
lead-acid batteries in the past. Exemplary embodiments of the positive grid metal alloy of
this invention overcome such problems with excellent mechanical properties, enhanced
corrosion resistance, less gassing and therefore lower rate of sulfation and water loss, and no
post-casting treatments required to age-harden battery grids.
         [0025] Moreover, presently described new, exemplary lead based alloys containing
tin, calcium, bismuth and copper may be characterized by enhanced mechanical properties,
corrosion resistance, less battery gassing, lower sulfation and water loss, and no post-casting
treatment requirements for age hardening so that the grids can be processed much sooner
after being cast or punched.
         [0026] One aspect of the present invention includes a lead-acid cell having a positive
plate and a negative plate disposed with a container, a separator disposed within said
container and separating said positive and negative plates, and an electrolyte within said
container, said positive plate comprising a grid supporting structure having a layer of active
material thereon, said grid supporting structure comprising a lead-based alloy consisting
essentially of lead, from about 1.5% to about 3.0% tin, from about 0.01% to about 0.02%
copper, from about 0.015% to about 0.04% bismuth, and from about 0.05% to about 0.08%
calcium, the percentages being based upon the total weight of said lead-based alloy.

alternative forms. The present invention will be described more fully hereinafter with
reference to the accompanying drawings in which like numerals represent like elements
throughout the several figures, and in which exemplary embodiments are shown. The figures
are not necessarily to scale and some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show
details of particular elements, while related elements may have been eliminated to prevent
obscuring novel aspects. The specific structural and functional details disclosed herein
should not be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a
representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present
invention.
         [0044] Although an industrial VRLA battery is shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the various
embodiments of the present invention may include any type of lead acid battery including, for
example, transportation batteries. FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary lead-acid battery having a
positive plate, indicated generally at 10, with a separator 12 enveloping the positive plate 10.
The positive plate 10 generally comprises a grid 14 having a plate lug 16 and positive active
material 18 pasted onto grid 14. As is known, there are many different configurations for the
grid. Additionally, in VRLA cells, the separator is typically an absorbent glass fiber mat.
Other commercially available glass fiber separators incorporate polyolefin or other polymeric
fibers to replace part of the glass fibers.
         [0045] FIG. 2 illustrates a VRLA cell, indicated generally at 20. The cell 20 thus
includes a container or jar 22 retaining snugly therein an element stack, shown generally at
24. The element stack 24 thus comprises a series of positive plates 10 and negative plates 26
alternately disposed and having separators 12 separating adjacent positive and negative
plates. Band 28 is used to hold adjacent plates in the desired compression and to facilitate
assembly (the band encircling the element stack 24, but being partially broken away in FIG. 2
for illustrative purposes). The VRLA cell 20 likewise includes a positive terminal 30, a
negative terminal 32, and a cover 34 affixed to container or jar 22 by any appropriate means,
as is known. Inasmuch as VRLA cells function by oxygen recombination, as is known, a low
pressure, self-resealing valve 36 is used to maintain the desired internal pressure within the
cell. Many suitable relief valves are known and used.
         [0046] The grid 14 includes a Pb-Sn-Ca type alloy with some other elements and
characteristics as described hereinafter below. In one embodiment, Ca is fixed at about
0.065%, just below the peritectic composition, and preferably no Ag is added.

          [0048] "Dog bone" samples were gravity cast. Hardness and tensile tests were
performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the alloys as-cast and aged at the room
temperature and heat treated at 1 000 C for three hours.
          [0049] The corrosion tests were performed at 60 0 C, in H2 SO 4 with 1.30 s.g., and with
potential of about 1.30V vs. Hg/Hg 2SO 4 reference electrode. Four samples of each alloy
were used for each test cell. The test time is from 1.5 to 11 months. After the corrosion test,
the weight loss and sample dimension changes were measured and the corrosion layer was
analyzed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and optical microscope.
          [0050] For the 1.5, 5 and 8-month corrosion test cells, the effect of variables were
similar. FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate the main effect plots for the corrosion rate and sample length
growth from the 8-month test cell. Both Sn and Bi reduce the corrosion rate and sample
growth. Cu almost has no effect on the corrosion rate but reduces the sample growth. Ba had
a negative effect on the corrosion rate and sample growth.
          [0051] The effect of Sn on the corrosion rate is more significant from 1.5 to 2.0%
than from 2.0 to 3.0%. Therefore, the preferred alloy is with 2.0%Sn, 0.032%Bi and
0.0125%Cu (Alloy 15 in the matrix) and was selected for battery build tests.
          [0052] FIGS. 5-8 compare mechanical properties for Alloy A and Alloy 15. With
higher Ca content, Alloy 15 has higher hardness (FIG. 5), yield (FIG. 6) and tensile (FIG. 7)
strength with the similar elongation (FIG. 8).
          [0053] Oxygen overvoltage measurements were carried out in 1.30 SG sulfuric acid at
25 0 C, 35 0 C, and 45 0C, respectively, at electrodes fabricated from Alloys 15, A, and B (pure
lead). The Tafel parameters derived from the Tafel equation         n (overvoltage) = a + b Log[i]
are presented in Table 3, below, where a is the intercept and b is the slope. b represents the
overvoltage per a decade increment in current density, and a is related to the exchange
current density at the open circuit voltage by the relationship Log[io]     = a/b. The Tafel slope,
b, is the same for all the 3 test alloys. The Tafel slope is related to the reaction mechanism
for oxygen evolution at the test electrode. What this means is that the mechanism for oxygen
evolution appears to be independent of alloy type or the operating temperature.

         [0054] The exchange current density, io, describes the rate of reaction (for 02
evolution) under open circuit conditions. The higher the value, the greater is the rate of 02
evolution at that electrode. A higher exchange current density would signify a catalytic effect
of the alloy on oxygen evolution. The exchange current density for alloy 15 is appreciably
lower than that for Alloy A. In fact, it is comparable to that of Alloy B (pure Pb).
Furthermore, the activation energy for oxygen evolution on alloy 15 (similar to that of Alloy
B) is significantly higher than that of Alloy A.
         [0055] A plot of the polarization voltage at a specific current density of 10 mA/cm2
in FIG. 9 confirms a much higher polarization resistance for Oxygen evolution on Alloy 15
than on Alloy A. Consequently, the rate of oxygen evolution on Alloy 15 would be expected
to be relatively lower than that on Alloy A but comparable to that of Alloy B (pure Pb). The
lower gassing rate could lead to lower self-discharge rates in the battery and to a more
efficient recombination process in VRLA systems.
         [0056] Bismuth in combination with copper and tin in the alloy raises the oxygen
overvoltage. Alloying additives that raise the oxygen overvoltage have the propensity to
mitigate the impact of gassing at the positive plate. Alloy 15 is comparable to Alloy B (pure
lead) in terms of resistance to gassing at the positive plate.
Cell test results
         [0057] Based on the above lab test results, Alloy 15
(Pb2.0Sn0.065Ca0.032Bi0.0125Cu) is selected for the battery test. Test results are illustrated
in FIGS. 10-13.
         [0058] FIG. 10 illustrates stand loss, or average voltage drop (mV) after 112 days for
Alloy 15, 13 and A.

         [0059] FIG. 11 illustrates BCI cycle life capacity discharge for Alloy 15 cells.
         [0060] FIG. 12 illustrates low rate cycle life, C/8, 100% DoD cycle test (Alloy 15,
residual capacity = 95% after 580 cycles) for a 2-Volt AGM cell version.
         [0061] FIG. 13 illustrates low rate cycle life, C/8, 100% DoD cycle test (Alloy A,
residual capacity = 80% after 600 cycles) for another 2-Volt AGM cell version.
         [0062] As can be seen, the up-to-date cell test results show that alloy 15 performs
equally or better than Alloy A. Other alloys, including but not limited to, alloys 13, 14 and
16 may adequately satisfy the diverse requirements needed for making battery grids for
positive plates. Moreover, these alloys are characterized by enhanced mechanical properties,
corrosion resistance, less battery gassing and water loss, enhanced electrical performance,
and no post-casting treatment requirements for age hardening so that the grids can be
processed much sooner after being cast. These criteria should be satisfied regardless of the
type of application.
         [0063] It is important to note that the construction and arrangement of the elements of
the alloy for a battery grid as shown in the preferred and other exemplary embodiments is
illustrative only. Although only a few embodiments of the present inventions have been
described in detail in this disclosure, those skilled in the art who review this disclosure will
readily appreciate that many modifications are possible (e.g. variations in combinations and
subcombinations of the amounts of the alloy elements) without materially departing from the
novel teachings and advantages of the subject matter recited in the claims. For example,
elements may be substituted and added, and the amounts of the elements may vary.
Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the
present invention as defined in the appended claims. The order or sequence of any process or
method steps may be varied or re-sequenced according to alternative embodiments. Other
substitutions, modifications, changes and omissions may be made in the design, operating
conditions and arrangement of the preferred and other exemplary embodiments without
departing from the spirit of the present inventions as expressed in the appended claims.
