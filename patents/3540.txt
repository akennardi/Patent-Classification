                                             ABSTRACT
        A pet door is provided having a frame unit and a pivotal flap. The pet door includes
a sill which is magnetically biased to attach to the lower end of the flap unit so as to
maintain the flap unit in its closed position and to resist pressure differential forces applied
to the flap unit, but to provide a lower degree of resistance at one or both of lower corners
of the flap unit. The sill includes a first latch member extending from the sill which
cooperates with a second latch member coupled to the bottom of the flap unit, At least one
of the latch members may be frusto-conical in shape.

                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0004]      This section is intended to introduce various aspects of the art, which may be
associated with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.            This discussion is
believed to assist in providing a framework to facilitate a better understanding of particular
aspects of the present disclosure.    Accordingly, it should be understood that this section
should be read in this light, and not necessarily as admissions of prior art.
Field of the Invention
[0005]      The present inventive concept relates to the field of pet doors.             More
particularly, the invention relates to a pet door having a pliable flap, wherein the flap is
heavily biased towards a closed position yet may still be opened by a pet for ingress and
egress.

Technology in the Field of the Invention
[0006]       Conventional pet doors are typically installed in a barrier, such as a residential
door or wall, to enable a domestic pet to traverse through the barrier by way of the pet door.
These pet doors oftentimes include a frame with a hinged flap or with a swinging door.
The frame defines a passageway of sufficient size to allow a pet to pass through, and is
typically installed by first cutting a through-opening in the structure. The frame cooperates
with the structure at the through-opening such that, when the frame is installed, the
passageway is defined at the through-opening to the extent that the passageway provides a
passage through the structure.
[0007]       The flap is disposed proximate the passageway and is movable between a closed
position and an open position. When in the closed position, the flap substantially covers
the passageway such that environmental elements do not pass there through. When in the
open position, the flap permits the pet to pass through the passageway. The flexible flap
member allows the pet to freely pass in and out as needed or desired.
[0008]       Hinged door designs utilize either a pliable flap material or a rigid panel that
insulates from heat and cold by maintaining a releasable seal around the edges of the frame.
Various mechanisms are used to create this seal. These include rubber wipers and felt
pads.
[0009]       The flap itself is typically held in its closed (or sealed) position by gravity. In
this respect, the weight of the hinged flap causes the flap to hang in its closed position
below a hinge mechanism. Commonly, a magnetic attraction is formed by magnets in the
flap, in the bottom sill of the frame, or both, to further bias the flap in its closed position.
[0010]       A common deficiency of such designs is the occurrence of wind, which can
either push or pull at the flap, causing the seal to be broken. In addition, differences in
pressure between the inside of a residence and the outside can cause a hinged flap to be
                                                    2

pushed or pulled. Even a slight crack in the seal can result in energy inefficiency and
discomfort to residents as outside air is exchanged in the home.
[0011]      It has further been observed that most pets (particularly dogs of at least average
intelligence) develop a preferential side (right or left) for nudging a flap unit towards its
open position. Therefore, it is offered herein to provide pet door arrangements that increase
the bias of the holding mechanism to add resistance to wind forces or other pressure
differential in the central area of the flap unit, that is, the area not preferred by the pet, thus
adding to the holding efficacy.
[0012]      The holding mechanisms of the present invention are designed to resist both
straight and upward forces while allowing torsional forces originating only at the corners to
release the hold.
[0013]      A need therefore exists for an improved animal door wherein the seal of a
hinged flap is maintained in the face of wind action or pressure differential, while allowing
a trained pet to push the flap open.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0014]      An improved pet door is provided herein.           In one embodiment, the pet door
comprises a first frame unit and a second opposing frame unit. The two frame units are
designed to be placed on opposing surfaces of a structural barrier such as a wall or a door.
The frame units are preferably configured to be secured to the wall or door by means of a
mechanical fastener such as a bolt.
[0015]      The pet door also has a flap unit. In one embodiment, the flap unit is pivotally
secured to a horizontally-oriented bar placed at the top of one of the frame units. The flap
unit is fabricated from a polymeric (or other flexible) material that may optionally be cut
to-size by the pet owner.
                                                     3

[0016]      The pet door also has a holding mechanism.             The holding mechanism is
designed to resist pressure differential between inside and outside surfaces of the flap unit.
The holding mechanism is automatically engaged when the pet door flap is at rest. The
mechanism is easily released when a pet applies force to one of the lower corners of the
flap in an effort to pass through the door.
[0017]      The flap unit automatically re-engages the holding mechanism after the pet
passes. A key aspect of the method is that the pet provides the releasing force through
learning that the flap releases by applying pressure to one or the other of the sides of the
flap, but not the center.
[0018]      Beneficially, a pet can be trained (or indeed, self-trained) to open a pet door flap
by using its head or nose to push at one side or the other side of the flap unit. This initial
torsional force, twists the flap at the bottom to release the holding mechanism. When the
flap is in its closed position, the holding mechanism resists straight wind force that can
normally push the flap forward or back and/or "belly" the flap pulling it straight up at the
bottom.

Description of Selected Specific Embodiments
[0044]      Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an illustrative barrier 50. In this view, the barrier
50 is a door within a residence.
[0045]      A pet door 100 has been installed within the barrier 50. A hinged flap 110 is
shown as part of the pet door 100. The hinged flap 110 covers a through-opening (shown
at 25 in Fig. 2A), providing at least some insulation for the house where the door 50 is
hung relative to any ambient conditions present on the opposite side of the door 50.
[0046]      In the arrangement of Fig. 1, the door is installed over a floor surface 10. The
pet door 100 is positioned within the door 50 and above the floor surface 10 to allow a pet
to step through the flap 110. Preferably, the flap 110 provides a means for the pet to leave
a structure and to go outdoors.
[0047]      Fig. 2A is a perspective view of the pet door 100 of Fig. 1. Here, the pet door
100 has been removed from the barrier 50 for illustrative purposes. It can be seen that the
pet door 100 includes a frame 120. The frame 120 represents a four-sided polygon, and is
typically fabricated from plastic or aluminum.
[0048]      The pet door also includes the hinged flap 110. The pivoting motion and the
pliable nature of the pliable flap unit 110 are seen.
[0049]      Fig. 2B is a front view of the flap unit 110 from the pet door 100 of Fig. 1. It is
observed that the flap unit 110 includes an upper end 112 and a lower end 114. The upper
end 112 contains a series of through-openings 113. These are dimensioned to receive pins
(shown at 115 in Fig. 2A), which in turn pivotally connect the upper end 112 to the frame.
The lower end 114 comprises a magnet. The magnet cooperates with a ferro-magnetic
                                                   8

material placed along a bottom member of the frame 120 to bias the flap unit 110 in a
closed position.
[0050]      Fig. 3A is a perspective view of a pet door 300A, in a preferred form of the
invention. The pet door 300A is shown installed within a barrier 50, shown in the form of a
residential door above a floor surface 10. This pet door 300A employs two separate frame
units designed to be secured to opposing sides of a barrier.
[0051]      In the arrangement of Fig. 3A, the frame units represent a first frame unit 301
and a second frame unit 302. A pliable flap unit 310A is connected to a top frame member
of the first frame unit 301 using a connection member 305A.         The connection member
305A is simply a strip of material that secures an upper end of the flap unit 310A to the
first frame unit 302 using screws or pins 315A.
[0052]      Fig. 3B is a perspective view of a pet door 300B, in another alternate
embodiment. This pet door 300B also employs separate frame units designed to be secured
to opposing sides of a barrier. For the embodiment of Fig. 3B, the barrier is ideally a door.
[0053]      In the arrangement of Fig. 3B, the frame units represent a first frame unit 311
and a second frame unit 312. A flap unit 310B is connected to a top frame member of the
first frame unit 311 using a pivoting connection member 305B. The connection member
305B is described more fully in U.S. Patent No. 9,249,617, also owned by the applicant
herein.    U.S. Patent No. 9,249,617 is entitled "Animal Door Having an Adjustable
Resistance Against Being Opened," and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
It is noted that the flap unit 310B is a rigid member.       This is not desirable for some
embodiments of the present invention.
[0054]      Fig. 4 is a perspective view of an animal door 400 in another embodiment. The
view shows first 400A and second 400B frame units, and an intermediate flap unit 650.
The frame units 400A, 400B and flap unit 650 are shown in exploded-apart relation.
                                                 9

[0055]       Referring specifically to the second frame unit 400B, the second frame unit
400B comprises four separate floating corner pieces. The corner pieces include two upper
floating corner pieces 410B and two lower floating corner pieces 415B. Each corner piece
410B, 415B defines a body forming a right angle, with each body having opposing right
angle ends.
[0056]       The second frame unit 400B also includes four bars. The bars include left and
right opposing side bars 425B, and top and bottom bars 420B. The left and right side bars
425B are of the same length, and the top and bottom bars 420B are of the same length. In
one aspect, the left and right side bars 425B and the top and bottom bars 420B are all of the
same length. The top bar includes a flap mounting flange 425 having flap mounting holes
428 there through.
[0057]       The left, right, top and bottom bars 425B and 420B, respectively, connect to
corresponding generally right angle ends of the corner pieces 410B, 415B through slideable
or telescopic connections, shown in the drawings as mortise-and-tendon type connections,
to form right and left length adjustable bar members, and top and bottom length adjustable
bar members. In the illustrative arrangement of Fig. 4, the tenons reside at opposing ends
of the left and right side bars 425B, while the mortise openings reside within the right angle
ends of the corner pieces 410B and 415B. The tenon portions of the left and right side bars
425B are shown at 427B, while the tenon portions of the top and bottom bars 420B are
shown at 423B. The mortise openings are indicated at 414B and 424B.
[0058]       It is understood that the mortise-and-tenon arrangement may be reversed.       In
this respect, the tenons may reside at the right angle ends of the corner pieces 410B, 415B,
while the mortise openings may reside at opposing ends of the side bars 420B and 425B.
In either aspect, the second frame unit 400B forms a collection of slidable or telescopic
components.      Sliding the components allows a pet owner, or pet door installer, to readily
adjust a size of an opening 450 formed by the components of the frame unit 400B through
relative positioning of the side bars 420B and 425B into the corner pieces 410B and 415B.
                                                 10

[0059]      It is observed here that the first frame unit 400A is formed generally of the same
slidable or telescopic components. Thus, floating corner pieces 410A, 415A correspond to
floating corner pieces 410B, 415B; left and right side bars 425A correspond to left and
right side bars 425B, and top and bottom bars 420A correspond to top and bottom bars
420B, thereby forming right and left bar members as well as top and bottom bar members.
[0060]      The first 400A and second 400B frame units are designed to be coupled to each
other so as to be fixedly attached to a structure, such as a residential door or wall.
[0061]      Fig. 5 is another perspective view of the animal door 400 of Fig. 4. Here, the
two frame units 400A, 400B are affixed to opposing surfaces of a residential door 50 . The
door 50 has a lower end 10 adjacent a floor (such as floor surface 10 in Fig. 1) and a door
knob 60. The frame units 400A, 400B form an opening 610 (shown covered by flap unit
610) that aligns with a through-opening 450 (seen in Fig. 4) formed (typically by manually
cutting) in the door 50.
[0062]      In order to secure the first 400A and second 400B frame units to the residential
door 50, one or more mechanical connectors 417 is provided, which are shown in the
drawings in the form of pins or bolts 417. In the arrangement of Figs. 4 and 5, bolts 417
are placed through mounting holes 412B in the corner pieces 410B, 415B. The bolts 417
extend through holes in the door 50 and through corresponding mounting holes 112A in the
corner pieces 410A, 415A. Nuts 416 are then threaded onto the bolts 417 and tightened to
provide a fixed connection to the residential door 50 there between.
[0063]      As noted, the pet door 400 also includes a flap unit 650 coupled to the first
400A and second 400B frame units. The flap unit 650 is pivotally secured to the second
frame unit 400B. Of course, it is understood that the flap unit 650 may alternatively be
attached to the first frame unit 400A inasmuch as the first 400B and second 400A frame
units are essentially interchangeable.
                                                   11

[0064]      The flap unit 650 defines a flexible, planar surface fabricated from a pliable
material such as polyethylene, natural rubber, polypropylene, iso-propylene or other
elastomeric material.
[0065]      The flap unit 650 includes a central panel 610 and two oppositely disposed side
panels 620 extending laterally from the central panel 610. The central panel 610 has a top
edge with three mounting holes 612 there through which are configured to align with flap
mounting holes 628 within the flap mounting flange 625. (The flap mounting flange 625
extends down from upper bar 420B.) Each of the side panels 620 has a corrugated profile,
forming a series of vertical creases 622.     The corrugated profile of the side panels 620
allows the flap unit 650 to maintain an inherent spring property, biasing the central panel
310 outwardly when compressed.
[0066]      The flap unit 650 further includes a bottom panel 630 extending downwardly
from the central panel 610.     The bottom panel 630 likewise includes a corrugated, or
ridged, profile forming horizontal creases 632. Of interest, the left and right side panels
620 bound opposing ends of the bottom panel 630.
[0067]      The creases in the left, right panels 620 and the bottom panel 630 form vertical
and horizontal cutting guides, respectively, for the pet owner, or the pet door installer. In
this way, the flap unit 650 may be cut to conform to the selected size of the opening 450
provided by the positioning of frame units 400A, 400B.          It is understood that if the
dimensions of the opening 450 are changed after installation, such as when a pet grows to a
larger size or when a new pet is acquired, a new flap unit 650 will need to be cut and
installed should the new opening 450 be longer and/or wider than the size of the original
opening.
[0068]      The flap unit 650 optionally includes a connection bar 616 having three
mounting holes 618 therein. The mounting holes 618 are configured to align with central
flap mounting holes 612. As such, mechanical fasteners, such as mounting bolts or screws
                                                  12

614 are passed through the flap mounting holes 628 of the flap mounting flange 625,
through the mounting holes 612 of central panel 610, and threaded into mounting holes 618
of the central bar 616 to pivotally secure the flap unit 650 to the first frame unit 400B.
[0069]      Lastly, the flap unit 650 includes a magnetic element 635 that engages the
bottommost ridge of the bottom panel 630.         The magnetic element 635 is magnetically
drawn to a ferro-magnetic element 636 disposed in bottom bar 420B to bias the flap unit
350 to a flap-closed position.
[0070]      Fig. 6A is an enlarged perspective view of the flap unit 650 of Fig. 4. Left and
right side panels 620L and 620R, and the bottom panel 630, are more clearly seen,
[0071]      Fig. 6B is a further enlarged perspective view of the flap unit 650 of Fig. 6A.
Here, an illustrative corrugated profile of the left panel 620L is more clearly seen. Creases
622 along the left panel 620L are also more clearly seen. The creases 622 serve as pre
formed cutting guides for the pet owner.
[0072]      Fig. 7A is a perspective view of a portion of a pet door 700 of the present
invention, in one embodiment. Specifically, a bottom portion 722 of a pet door frame 720
is shown. The bottom portion, or bottom frame member 722, comprises a channel or recess
735. The recess 735 is configured to hold a floating sill 730 which is vertically moveable
within the recess 735. In the illustrative arrangement of Fig. 7A, two separate floating sills
730 are provided.     The floating sills 730 are placed proximate a center portion of the
bottom frame member 722.
[0073]      It is observed that the floating sills 730 represent generally u-shaped bodies.
Fig. 7B is a perspective view of one of the floating sills 730 of the pet door of Fig. 7A. It
can be seen that the floating sill 730 includes side walls 732 forming an elongated channel
735. The channel 735 is dimensioned to receive the bottom magnetic portion of a flap unit,
such as bottom end 114 of Fig. 2B or bottom end 630 of Fig. 4.
                                                  13

[0074]      Fig. 7C is a cross-sectional view of the bottom frame member 722 of Fig. 7A.
The floating sill 730 of Fig. 7B is shown therein. The floating sill 730 is fabricated from a
ferro-magnetic material. When the bottom magnetic portion of a flap unit within the frame
720 moves towards its closed position, the floating sill(s) 730 moves up to "capture" the
flap unit. More specifically, the channel 735 engages the bottom magnet end of the flap
unit, holding it in a more secure position.
[0075]      It is noted that a bottom end of the floating sill 730 contains a flange 734. The
flange 734 extends outside of the opposing side walls 732. When the floating sill 730 rises
within the recess 735 to engage the bottom end of a flap unit, the flange 734 encounters
shoulders 706 protruding into a recess 725 of the bottom frame member 722.                The
shoulders 706 prevent the floating sill 730 from moving completely out of the recess 725.
[0076]      In the pet door 700, the floating sill(s) 730 resides central to the bottom frame
member 722. The magnetic connection provided by the floating sill(s) 730 holds a central
area of the flap unit in the sill(s) 730 and resists pressure or vacuum created by wind,
maintaining a seal. At the same time, a pet is able to nudge the flap unit open with relative
ease by pushing on one of the unbiased (or at least less biased) corners of the flap unit.
Thus, the holding mechanism is released only when force is applied at either the right or
left bottom side of the flap, "pealing" the flap from the bottom sill 730 with ease.
[0077]      It is understood that a pet may still move the flap unit and pass through the pet
door by "nudging" a central portion of the flap unit. However, this will require much
greater force, causing a pet to quickly self-train to nudge the flap unit in one corner or the
other. This allows the flap unit to release its seal more easily.
[0078]      Fig. 8A is a perspective view of a pet door 800A of the present invention, in an
alternate embodiment. The pet door 800A again includes a flap unit 810 and a frame 820.
Here, a lower end 812 of the flap unit 810 is seen. The lower end 812 of the flap unit 810
                                                   14

comprises a rail 829 having a central latch 830.           The latch 830, in turn, includes a
dovetailed-shaped catch or recess 832A.
[0079]      The pet door 800A also includes a rounded off, dovetailed-shaped tab 834A.
The tab 834A is located central to a lower or bottom frame member 822 of the frame 820.
The tab 834A is configured to be received within the recess 832A. Thus, the tab 834A
comprises a mating projection or profile that engages the recess 832A to secure the flap
unit 810 in its closed position. As the tab 834A is rounded in shape it may be considered to
be of an elliptical, frusto-conical shape.
[0080]      In the arrangement of Fig. 8A, the tab 834A has a dovetail or trapezoidal profile
while the recess 832A has an inverted dovetail or trapezoidal profile. Preferably, the latch
830 is a magnet while the tab 834A is fabricated from a ferro-magnetic material such as
steel. Of course, the opposite could be equally functional, meaning that the tab 834A may
be a magnet while the latch 830 is fabricated from a ferro-magnetic material,
[0081]      It is also observed that the position of the recess 832A and the tab 834A may be
reversed. Such an arrangement is shown in Fig. 8B.
[0082]      Fig. 8B is a perspective view of a pet door 800B of the present invention, in
such an alternate embodiment. Here, it is seen that a recess 832B is placed along an upper
surface of the bottom frame member 822. Reciprocally, an elliptical, frusto-conical shaped
tab 834B is provided as a projection extending down from the lower end 812 of the flap
unit 810, central to the flap unit 810.
[0083]      Again, it is desirable that the recess 832B and the tab 834B cooperate through a
magnetic attraction force. Preferably, the tab 834B is a magnet while the recess 832B is
fabricated from a ferro-magnetic material. Alternatively, the recess 832B may be a magnet
while the tab 834B may be fabricated from a ferro-magnetic material.
                                                   15

[0084]       Fig. 8C shows the tab 834A of Fig. 8A in mating contact with the latch 830 and
recess 832A. It can be seen that a relatively close fit is provided, which in turn provides an
increased level of sealing protection for the flap unit 810 against pressure differential. A
stronger hold is provided central to the flap unit than to opposing lower corners.
[0085]       In the arrangement of Fig. 8C, a novel holding mechanism is provided. The
holding mechanism comprises a cut-out in the elongated bottom of the flap and an
extending member on the frame sill. This cut-out is inventive and novel in that it includes
an inverted shape that mechanically holds the flap to the sill when pressure or vacuum
created by wind allowing the sill and flap to move together vertically to form a strong seal.
The extending member on the frame sill will be precisely fit so a force only in the centroid
of the flap will lock and continue to lock until an uneven force is applied to either corner of
the elongated flap. It is understood that other shapes for the recess 832 and the tab 834
may be employed to create a magnetic holding mechanism having increased strength along
a central, longitudinal axis.
[0086]       Variations of the pet door and the method of installing such may fall within the
spirit of the claims, below. An example of such a variation is presented in Figs. 9A and
9B.
[0087]       Fig. 9A is a front perspective view of the pet door 900 of the present invention,
in an alternate embodiment. In this arrangement, the pet door 900 has a flap unit 910. The
flap unit is sized to pivot into the through-opening of a barrier, such as a door. The flap
unit 910 has an upper end 912 and a lower end 914.           Of interest, the flap unit 910 is
fabricated from a pliable material.
[0088]       The pet door 900 also includes a first frame unit 920 . The frame unit 920
comprises an upper frame member 922, a lower or bottom frame member 924, and
opposing side members 926. The frame members 922, 924, 926 define an opening therein.
The opening is configured to align with the through-opening in the door.
                                                  16

[0089]      The pet door 900 also has at least one mechanical fastener.       The mechanical
fasteners may be bolts or screws.       The fasteners are received within holes 902 placed
around the frame members 922, 924, 926. In this way, the frame unit 920 may be secured
to the door.
[0090]      It is understood that the pet door 900 may, and likely will, include a second
frame unit (not shown). The second frame unit will be dimensioned to generally match the
first frame unit 920, just as frame units 400A and 400B of Fig. 4 have similar dimensions.
[0091]      The pet door 900 further has a connection member 905.             The connection
member 905 connects the upper end 912 of the flap unit 910 to the upper frame member
922 of the first frame unit 910. Connection pins or screws 915 secure the flap unit 910 to
the connection member 905.         Because the flap unit 910 is fabricated from a pliable
material, the flap unit 910 is able to pivot below the connection member 905 between open
and closed positions.
[0092]      The pet door 900 additionally has a moveable sill 925. The sill 925 is disposed
along the lower frame member 924. In one aspect, the sill 925 defines an elongated bar
configured to move vertically between a lower position wherein the sill 925 rests along the
bottom frame member 924, and an upper position wherein the sill 925 moves between 2
and 20 millimeters up in the direction of the upper frame member 922. The sill 925 has
inwardly turned end walls 928 which capture a T-shaped rail 929 extending upwardly from
the lower frame member 924. The sill 925 has sufficient play, as shown in Fig. 9C, to
allow for vertical movement and rocking or tilting movement of the sill 925 relative to the
lower frame member 924.
[0093]      The pet door assembly 900 also includes a tab 932. The tab 932 extends from a
central portion of the sill 925 into the opening. The sill 925 includes a pair of magnets 927
with one magnet 927 positioned on each side of the tab 932.
                                                  17

[0094]      Fig. 9B is an enlarged view of a lower portion of the pet door 900 of Fig. 9A.
The floating sill 925 and connected tab 932 are more clearly seen. The sill 925 defines an
elongated horizontal bar while the tab 932 has an inverted trapezoidal or elliptical frusto
conical or frusto-conical shaped profile that extends up from the bar.
[0095]      The pet door 900 further has an elongated end piece or strip 930 which includes
a dovetailed-shaped recess 934 and a pair of ferro-magnetic material members 931
positioned on opposite sides of the recess 934. The recess 934 is formed within a lower
end of the flap unit 910 and specifically in the end strip 930.           The recess 934 is
dimensioned to closely receive the tab 932 as the flap unit 910 moves towards its closed
position, forming a latching member. This same arrangement is shown in Fig. 8C.
[0096]      In use, the flap unit 910 is biased towards its closed position by means of a
magnetic attraction. In addition, the sill 925 is biased towards its upper position by means
of the same magnetic attraction. Preferably, the recess 934 is configured to hold to the tab
932 and to prevent the tab 932 from releasing in response to a force applied symmetrically
across the flap unit 910, but to release from the tab 932 in response to a force applied to
either of the bottom corners 917 of the flap unit 910 through at least partial pivotal
movement of the flap unit recess 934 relative to the tab 932.
[0097]      The tilting or rocking movement of the sill 925 allows for the bellowing of the
flap unit 810 due to wind or pressure differentials without releasing the flap unit 910
because of the straight on engagement of the dovetailed-shaped tab 932 within the
dovetailed-shaped recess 934, i.e., the diverging sidewalls of the tab 932 remain engaged or
fully captured within the diverging sidewalls of the recess 934 as the sill rocks or tilts
generally to the same angle as the bellowing flap unit. The rocking movement of the sill
925 is best depicted in Fig. 9C. However, with the pet pushing upon one side or side edge
of the flap unit 910 the dovetailed-shaped recess 934 pivots or rotates relative to the
dovetailed-shaped tab 932 as the recess 934 is also pushed inwardly or outwardly
depending on the direction of pet movement. This pivotal movement along with the inward
                                                 18

or outward movement causes the release of the magnetic attraction between the magnet 927
and the ferro-magnetic material members 931 closest to the pet. With the release of this
magnetic pull or attraction the continued movement of the pet causes the dovetailed-shaped
recess 934 to slide and be disengaged from the dovetailed-shaped tab 932 through
continued sliding, pivotal movement, as shown in Fig. 9B. Subsequently, the magnetic
attraction between the distal pair of magnet 927 and the ferro-magnetic material members
931 is broken and the flap unit 910 is fully released from the frame 920. This side pressure
upon the flap unit 910 causes only minimal tilting or rocking of the sill 925, thereby
providing an quick and easy release of the dovetailed-shaped recess 934 from the
dovetailed-shaped tab 932.
[0098]      Again, it should be understood that the positions of the magnets 927 and the
ferro-magnetic members 931 may be reversed. Also, it should be understood that the tab
and recess may be made of magnetic materials as previously described in other
embodiments.
[0099]      It should be understood that the tab, or at least a portion of the tab, may be
elliptical frusto-conical or simply frusto-conical shape to allow for relative pivotal
movement of the recess therebetween. Additionally, the tab may include facets instead of a
curved exterior surface. Furthermore, the top surface of the tab is generally irrelevant as it
may be flat, domed shaped, recessed or any other shape. As such, as used herein, the term
frusto-conical includes all these shaped and any variation thereof as at least a portion of the
tab.
[00100]     As the dovetailed-shaped tab and the dovetailed-shaped recess in the multiple
embodiments may be reversed, each may be referred to simply as a first and/or second
dovetailed-shaped latch member.        Similarly, as the magnetic and the ferro-magnetic
material members may be reversed, each may be referred to simply as a first and/or second
magnetic member.
                                                 19

[00101]     It will be appreciated that the inventions are susceptible to modification,
variation and change without departing from the spirit thereof
                                              20
