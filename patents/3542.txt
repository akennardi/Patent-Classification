         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5       The present invention relates to a method for preparing a pharmaceutical
   intermediate which belongs to the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates
   to naproxen sodium drug intermediates 2-ethoxynaphthaloic acid synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
10       2-ethoxy naphthoic acid is an intermediate of the antibiotic class of naproxen
   sodium. Ethoxyphenyl penicillin sodium on the acid and penicillinase are quite stable,
   in addition to being used for injection, but also for oral. After oral administration of this
   product, the absorption rate is high, 1/2-1 hours blood concentration reached its peak,
   in the main tissues (such as kidney, muscle, heart, lung, etc.) get a higher concentration,
15 the bile concentration is the highest especially. The resistance spectrum is similar to
   that of penicillin G, but it can effectively inhibit the growth of drug-resistant
   Staphylococcus     aureus.   The    antibacterial   efficacy    of penicillin    G-sensitive
   Staphylococcus aureus is worse than that of penicillin G. The antimicrobial effect of
   resistant Staphylococcus aureus was stronger than that of penicillin G and methicillin
20 (BRL-1241), which is similar to that of new penicillin II (P-12). The antimicrobial
   effect of Streptococcus pyogenes are less effective than penicillin G, but stronger than
   methotrexate. It is more potent to mice infected with pneumococcus than methicillin
   and neomycin II. 2-ethoxynaphthoic acid as the intermediate of ethoxyne penicillin
   sodium drug, its synthesis method is of great significance. However, most of the
25 existing synthetic methods are using 2-ethoxynaphthalene aldehyde and potassium
   permanganate as the reactant, it is complicated and the final yield is not very high.
   Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new synthetic method for further improving the
   quality and yield of the product and reducing the byproduct content.
