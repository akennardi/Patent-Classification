ABSTRACT
A removable base installed below ground where top is flush with ground level. The
cylindrical base consists of an outer casing (1) sealed at bottom with cap (2). The inner
casing (4) sealed at bottom with cap (5), a top cap (6) with adaptable aperture (10) and
the internal cavity (11) to receive post. Concrete (7) fills space between inner casing (4)
and outer casing (1) for strength. The base has a small conduit (9) transversely
spanning outer casing (1), concrete (7), inner casing (4) and internal cavity (11) to
receive lifting tool (8) for base removal or installation. When not in use, base may be
sealed at top with cap (3) for safety and protection from elements.

REUSABLE BELOW GROUND POST SUPPORT
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001] The invention relates to a below ground support base for a post and
subsequent fencing system.
BACKGROUND
[0002] Currently the fencing options for post supports are limited to some permanent
solutions and some temporary solutions.
[0003] Typically in rural fencing applications fences are permanently erected around
paddocks. In the case of cattle, they may be grazing in one paddock and need to be
moved to the next paddock. In this case fences may need to be moved or new fences
may need to be constructed which may become costly. This process may also be quite
labour intensive as typically, the post depth is relative to the support provided. In areas
prone to flood and fire replacing fencing can be costly and considered just another loss.
[0004]   In some circumstances fences may only be needed on a temporary basis. Most
temporary fences consist of fence panels with posts supported by an above ground
base or feet. These systems can be difficult to set up and move, and may be a safety
hazard.

                                             2
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
[0005] Most permanent posts, partly below ground with a fencing system above
ground, need to be driven or dug into the ground substantially for support. Once in
place these post systems are permanent, costly, labour intensive, unable to be reused
or moved easily and they have a limited lifespan.
[0006] Temporary fencing currently, can be costly, cumbersome and in certain cases a
safety hazard. When a temporary fence is no longer needed, it is completely removed
and if needed again incurs further costs and labour.
[0007] The invention is a below ground base and or support that can be adapted for
use with any post. The size of the entire base can be increased or decreased, and the
inner cap aperture can be adapted to suit the post required. The bases are constructed
of PVC and concrete or alternatively concrete combined with recycled material such as
rubber, incurring minimal costs while providing strength, durability, maximum support
and an interminable lifespan, allowing for use and reuse or sold on if no longer required.
Not only does the base have a long life span itself but with the simple application of
sealant around the post aperture, the base protects the post from rusting or rotting that
can come from being in the ground. Multiple bases and posts are used to further
construct a fencing system. The base can be used for permanent or temporary fencing
needs.

                                               3
[0008] The base is lowered into a hole bored with a post hole digger to suit the
diameter of the base which results in a snug fit into the ground and a flush finish with
the ground surface. Removal of the base from below ground is simple and effective by
accessing the lifting conduit at the top of the base, inserting the lifting tool, a small steel
bar and lifting with machinery. Fences can be easily constructed and deconstructed as
needed. When the fence and posts are removed but the base remains below ground a
simple cap protects the interior of the base from the elements and provides a level and
safe ground surface to walk and work over. When the bases are no longer needed and
are withdrawn from the hole, the holes can be filled with dirt or any other suitable
material i.e. gravel or sand.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0009] The invention comprises of an elongated cylindrical PVC outer casing 1, with a
permanently fixed retaining cap 2 at the bottom. The interior comprises of a smaller
diameter and marginally shorter elongated cylindrical PVC casing 4, with a permanently
fixed retaining cap 5 at the bottom and a concrete fill 7 between the outer casing 1 and
the inner casing 4 providing strength and durability.
[0010] Figure 3 indicates the inner cap 6 at the top of the inner casing 4 (in this
example) with a Y shaped aperture 10 to receive the corresponding post.
[0011] Figures 5 and 6 illustrate a cross-section perspective revealing the internal
cavity 11 inside the inner casing 4 to receive the post.
[0012] At a pre-determined distance from the top of the base there is a small conduit 9
transversely spanning the entire base, outer casing 1, inner casing 4, and concrete fill 7,
to accommodate the lifting tool 8, a small steel bar, which is used and reused to attach
the base to lifting machinery to be lowered into pre-dug holes for construction or lifted
out for deconstruction of a fencing system or for individual base use.
[0013] Figures 1 and 2 indicate the base installed relative to ground level. The base
can be simply surrounded by soil or more permanently concreted in place. When the
base is embedded below ground but will not be in use, a protective cap 3 is temporarily
fixed at the top to protect the interior from unwanted debris and should be installed as to
create a flush finish with ground level thus providing a flat surface to work over safely.

                                               6
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
[0014] The base and subsequent fencing system can be applied to rural or domestic
fencing needs. The base provides a simplistic and cost effective option with the
benefits of strength, durability, reusability and an interminable life span which in turn
extends the life of the post. With the bases installed, the fence alone can be
deconstructed in moments in case of emergency i.e. flood or fire.
[0015] Another possible application may be as vineyard trellising providing the above
mentioned benefits resulting in low maintenance and very little impact on the produce.
[0016] For a less permanent application the bases may be used to create fencing for a
crowd control situation. The bases should be installed below ground as to provide a
flush finish with the ground surface. The temporary fence may be constructed as
needed, once the fence is no longer needed it may be deconstructed and stored for
future use or sold on if no longer required. The bases remaining below ground are fitted
with the protective cap to avoid unwanted debris and more importantly provide a flat
surface, flush with ground level, to walk and work over safely, avoiding any hazard.
[0017] The base may also be used individually or in small numbers for a temporary or
permanent bollard type post. Typically bollards are used to minimise access to certain
paths or areas. This invention also provides the option of post removal while the base
remains below ground for reoccurring or repeated use and or disuse. The base
provides not only an economical solution but the base also gives provision to strength
and durability through the simplistic use of PVC and concrete.

                                            7
[0018] The illustrated example merely demonstrates the usage of one size and type of
post. It must be understood that within the scope of the invention, the overall size and
shape of the base may be easily adapted to accommodate any size or shape post whilst
maintaining the benefits and advantages mentioned.
