 COMBINATION THERAPIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S
                       DISEASE AND RELATED DISORDERS
                   CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional Application No. 61/718,303, filed
October 25, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes..
                                        BACKGROUND
[0002] Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the brain, which
is characterized by the memory deterioration, behavioral disturbances, impairment of activities
of daily living, and loss of independent function. It is thought that 18-24 million people in the
world are currently suffering from AD, two-thirds of whom are living in developed or
developing countries. This number is expected to reach 34 million by 2025.
[0003] AD is a complicated disease. It may even be the result of more than one disease. It is
characterized by an accumulation otinsoluble aggregates of amyloid-beta peptide (Ap). such as
AP oligomers. These aggregates or oligomers are associated with cell inflammatory response and
are thought to bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse,
thereby disrupting neuronal communication. Due to the minute amount produced per day (22-27
ng/day) and accumulated for years (about 7-10 mg in brains of AD subjects), this daily
inflammatory response is invisible and not associated with any major symptoms. In addition, tau
protein abnormalities are thought to play a role in the disease cascade. Hyperphosphorylated tau
proteins are thought to pair with other threads of tau. Eventually, they form neurofibrillary
tangles inside nerve cell bodies. When this occurs, the microtubules disintegrate, collapsing the
neuron's transport system. This may result first in malfunctions in biochemical communication
between neurons and later in the death of the cells.
[0004] The recent failures of several promising drugs have spurred greater urgency to investigate
new targets and their interconnectedness. That said, new therapies for Alzheimer's are needed.

mechanisms of action in monotherapy.
[0023] Figure 4 depicts the water maze recorded data of in vivo cromolyn and ibuprofen
treatment of transgenic mice-modeling like Alzheimer's Disease.        The results indicate that
treated transgenic mice have closely behavior to wild type normal control group.
[0024] Figure 5 illustrates the measurement of TBS soluble AP level by WAKO ELISA. The
experiments show that TBS AP level decreases following by treatment of cromolyn sodium with
dose-dependency.    Figure 5A shows that AP-40 level decreases following by treatment of
cromolyn sodium with dose-dependency. Figure 5B shows that Aj-42 level decreases following
by treatment of cromolyn sodium with dose-dependency. N=3 or 5 animals per group, average ±
SE. The p value is significant using one-way ANOVA test (Bonferroni's test). Both of total
soluble AP (as shown as Gdn+) and monomeric AP (as shown as Gdn-) decease after the
addition of cromolyn sodium. The dose of 2.1 mg/kg of cromolyn sodium was enough to
decrease TBS soluble Ap.
[0001]      Figure 6 illustrates the measurement of TBS soluble AP oligomer level IBL oligomer
ELISA. The experiments show that AP oligomer level was not changed following the treatment
with cromolyn sodium. Figure 6A shows the experiments of IBL AP oligomer ELISA (82El

using AP WAKO ELISA. N=3 or 5 animals per group, average ± SE.                 The p value is not
significant using one-way ANOVA test (Bonferroni's test). Both ELISA (IBL oligomer ELISA
and the differences between with and without Gdn using WAKO ELISA) showed that oligomer
level was not changed following the treatment with cromolyn sodium.
[0025] Figure 7 illustrates the biodistribution of cromolyn Compound A following intravenous
injection in mice. In Figure 7, a 5, 30 or 60 minute, corresponding to Series 1, 2 or 3, repectively
in the graph, brain uptake shows 1% accumulation with little or no washout for the period
measured.
[0026] Figure 8 illustrates AP aggregation test in the absence of cromolyn. The experiment was
assayed by thioflavin fluorescent intensity kinetics.
[0027] Figure 9 illustrate AP aggregation test after the addition of cromolyn (C0399) or its 19F
derivative (TS734).    The addition of cromolyn (C0399) and its         19F derivative (TS734) at
nanomolar concentration shows inhibition of AP aggregation.

Therapeutic Agents
[0030] Featured herein are methods of treating or preventing an amyloidosis-associated
condition in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically
effective amount of at least two compounds selected from the group consisting of an AP peptide
polymerization inhibitor, an anti-inflammatory; a compound that improves cognitive function,
mood, or social behavior, a compound associated with Tau or alpha-Synuclein and a compound
that regulates amyloid peptide washout. The methods involve multifunctional treatment
combinations and dosing.

[0031] These combination treatments may slow down memory loss or brain degeneration in
early stages of AD. For example, a subject may be exhibiting mild cognitive impairment (MCI),
or may have a narrow MMSE (mini-mental state examination) score of between about 24 and
about 28.
[0032] These combination treatments may also be administered to subjects with AD. In certain
embodiments, the subjects experience improved quality of life.

[0039] A gamma secretase inhibitor, such as LY451039 (Semagacestat, Eli Lily) may also
function as an Ap peptide polymerization inhibitor. Metal ionophores, such as PBT2 (Prana),
which target metal-induced       aggregation of Ap may also         function as an Ap peptide
polymerization inhibitor. Statins may also function as Ap peptide polymerization inhibitors.
[0040] Endocannabinoids,      such     as   arachidonoylethanolamine,   tetrahydrocannabinol,    2
arachidonoyl glycerol, 2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether, N-arachidonoyl-dopamine, or virodhamine
are further examples of Ap peptide polymerization inhibitors.
[0041] An appropriate Ap peptide polymerization inhibitor should slow the rate of AP peptide
polymerization by at least about three times slower, about five times slower, about seven times
slower, about 10 times slower, about 15 times slower, about 20 times slower, about 25 times
slower, about 30 times slower, about 35 times slower, about 40 times slower, about 45 times
slower, about 50 times or about 100 times slower than the rate of Ap peptide polymerization in
the absence of the inhibitor.
[0042] An appropriate Ap peptide polymerization inhibitor should have appropriate structures
(size, lipophilicity, and charge) to allow for penetration of the blood brain barrier (BBB). In
addition the Ap peptide polymerization inhibitor may have specific affinity for solubilizing and
interacting with oligomers to prevent them from aggregating.
[0043] The daily required dose administration should be proportional to the approximate daily
quantity of Ap peptide; this dosing regimen minimizes side effects from extensive dosing.
Appropriate logP, polar surface area (PSA) and %PSA should determine brain permeability and
drug effectiveness.
[0044] An estimation of the amount of deposited amyloid-p in the brain requires data that have a
sufficient sample size and are derived from quantitative assay systems that are combined with
aggressive, formic acid extraction protocols. Assuming that the average weight of an AD brain is
1,150 g and the grey matter of the cortex, which contains the majority of deposited amyloid-p,
comprises 42% of the weight of the brain, Gravina et al. calculated that ~10 mg of amyloid-p per
brain is deposited, whereas Naslund et al. calculated that ~ 4 mg of amyloid-p per brain is
deposited. Although the result obtained by Naslund et al. is lower than other literature estimates,
for the purposes of this analysis the total amount of Ap in a human AD brain at end-stage disease
is assumed to be derived from 10 mg of Ap-plaque.
                                                  10

      WO 2014/066318                                                      PCT/US2013/066069
[0045] It is important to compare the amount of amyloid-p that is deposited in the AD brain with
the overall rate of amyloid-p production, to provide a conceptual framework for this aspect of the
disease process and to place into context the potential for different amyloid-p-centric
therapeutics to mediate a therapeutic effect. Therfore the estimated amount produced per day is
less than 25 ng per day.
[0046] In certain embodiments, the Ap peptide polymerization inhibitor is administered in nM
concentrations.

[0048] Anti-inflammatory compounds may also be a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID), such as acetylsalicylic acid, diflunisal, salsalate, ibuprofen, dexibuprofen, naproxen,
fenoprofen, ketoprofen, dexketoprofen, flurbiprofen, oxaprozin, loxoprofen, indomethacin,
tolmetin,   sulindac, etodolac, ketorolac,     diclofenac,  nabumetone, piroxicam, meloxicam,
tenoxicam, droxicam, lornoxicam, isoxicam, mefenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, flufenamic
acid, tolfenamic acid, celecoxib, licofelone, hyperforin, or figwort.
[0049] Since the inflammatory response to Ap peptide production has invisible side effect
symptoms, dosing control is important for preventing systemic side effect toxicity and worsening
outcome.
        Compounds That Improve Cognitive Function, Mood and/or Social Behavior
[0050] Agents for improving cognitive function, mood, and/or social behavior include
cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, riastigmine, or galantamine. Other examples include
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, such as memantine. Antioxidants, such as
vitamin E or selegiline may also improve a subject's cognitive function, mood and/or social
behavior. Allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid present in the blood is another example of an agent
that improves cognitive function, mood, or social behavior in a subject.
[0051] Agents that initiate and/or amplify a subject's immune response, such as a tumor necrosis
factor (TNF) inhibitor, e.g. etanercept or antibiotics, such as doxycycline, rifampin, or
minocycline, are also agents that improve cognitive function, mood, or social behavior.
[0052] Spiro-(N'-methyl-piperidyl-4')-N-ethyl-succinimide,      as described in U.S. Patent No.
4,481,206, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, is another example of an
agent that improves cognitive function, mood or social behavior. This molecule improves
cognitive function by compensatory activation of other receptors for improving nerve
communication and cognition. These agents are traditionally used to improve the quality of life
of subjects with onset and disease progression.
[0053] Latrepirdine appears to operate through multiple mechanisms of action, both blocking the
action of neurotoxic beta-amyloid proteins and inhibiting L-type calcium channels, modulating
the action of AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors, and may exert a neuroprotective effect by
                                                  13

      WO 2014/066318                                                        PCT/US2013/066069
blocking a novel target that involves mitochondrial pores, which are believed to play a role in the
cell death that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and the aging process.
[0054] R3487 (Roche) is a partial agonist of the nicotinic alpha-7 receptor, a highly specialized
receptor found in the central nervous system. In a recently completed Phase 2a study in
Alzheimer's disease patients, R3487 demonstrated a statistically significant effect on multiple
measures of cognition.
        Agents Associated with Tau or Alpha-Synuclein
[0055] Methylthioninium chloride, an inhibitor of tau protein aggregation is an example of an
agent that is associated with tau or alpha-synuclein. Agents that may stabilize tau while part of
the tubular nerve system may slow down the production of intra neuron fibrilary tangles and
slow down the progression of the disease.
        Agents that Regulate Amyloid Peptide Washout
[0056] AP-peptide specific antibodies, although they cannot penetrate the normal BBB, can cause
equilibrium changes between the amount of AP oligomers in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
and vascular system. The antibodies can bind and remove the AP peptide in CSF and blood and
cause the equilibrium to favor washout of the AP peptide from brain. While many of these
antibodies display significant toxicity and side effects, the toxicity is largely due to the large
doses required.
[0057] Examples of Ap-peptide specific antibodies include: bapineuzumab (Elan/Johnson &
Johnson), solanezumab (LY2062430) (Eli Lilly), gammaglobulin IV (Baxter), and PF-4360365
(Pfizer).
[0058] ACC-001 (Elan/Johnson & Johnson) is an anti-beta amyloid vaccine; it stimulates the
immune system to attack beta-amyloid.
[0059] Similarly, siRNA that targets AP peptide may be used. Some AD conditions and brain
injury cause a breakdown in the BBB; therefore siRNA can penetrate the brain and silence AP
peptide production.

[0060] CERE-1 10 (Ceregene Inc.) is nerve growth factor (NGF) gene therapy. NGF specifically
targets basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, which release acetylcholine (Ach) in the cerebral
cortex and hippocampus. Preclinical data in rats demonstrate that NGF prevented cholinergic
neuron cell death and reversed age-related behavioral decline. NGF gene therapy has been tested
in rhesus monkeys, and these studies demonstrated that NGF ameliorates cholinergic neuron
atrophy and restores cholinergic axonal density in aged monkeys to levels observed in young
monkeys.
[0061] Semagacestat      (LY450139)      is a gamma-secretase       inhibitor;  gamma secretase      is
responsible for proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Proteolysis of APP forms AP.
[0062] Another gamma secretase inhibitor is NIC5-15 (Humanetics).
Therapeutic Methods
[0063] Combinations of the compounds described above may be administered to a subject in a
single dosage form or by separate administration of each active agent. The agents may be
formulated into a single tablet, pill, capsule, or solution for parenteral administration and the like.
Individual therapeutic agents may be isolated from other therapeutic agent(s) in a single dosage
form. Formulating the dosage forms in such a way may assist in maintaining the structural
integrity of potentially reactive therapeutic agents until they are administered. Therapeutic agents
may be contained in segregated regions or distinct caplets or the like housed within a capsule.
Therapeutic agents may also be provided in isolated layers in a tablet.
[0064] Alternatively, the therapeutic agents may be administered as separate compositions, e.g.,
as separate tablets or solutions. One or more active agent may be administered at the same time
as the other active agent(s) or the active agents may be administered intermittently. The length of
time between administrations of the therapeutic agents may be adjusted to achieve the desired
therapeutic effect. In certain instances, one or more therapeutic agent(s) may be administered
only a few minutes (e.g., about 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, or 60 min) after administration of the other
therapeutic agent(s). Alternatively, one or more therapeutic agent(s) may be administered several
hours (e.g., about 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 24, or 36 h) after administration of the other therapeutic
agent(s). In certain embodiments, it may be advantageous to administer more than one dosage of
one or more therapeutic agent(s) between administrations of the remaining therapeutic agent(s).
                                                   15

     WO 2014/066318                                                          PCT/US2013/066069
For example, one therapeutic agent may be administered at 2 hours and then again at 10 hours
following administration of the other therapeutic agent(s). The therapeutic effects of each active
ingredient should overlap for at least a portion of the duration, so that the overall therapeutic
effect of the combination therapy is attributable in part to the combined or synergistic effects of
the combination therapy.
[0065] The dosage of the active agents will generally be dependent upon a number of factors
including pharmacodynamic characteristics of each agent of the combination, mode and route of
administration of active agent(s), the health of the patient being treated, the extent of treatment
desired, the nature and kind of concurrent therapy, if any, and the frequency of treatment and the
nature of the effect desired. In general, dosage ranges of the active agents often range from about
0.001 to about 250 mg/kg body weight per day. For a normal adult having a body weight of
about 70 kg, a dosage may range from about 0.1 to about 25 mg/kg body weight. However, some
variability in this general dosage range may be required depending upon the age and weight of
the subject being treated, the intended route of administration, the particular agent being
administered and the like. Since two or more different active agents are being used together in a
combination therapy, the potency of each agent and the interactive effects achieved using them
together must be considered. Importantly, the determination of dosage ranges and optimal
dosages for a particular mammal is also well within the ability of one of ordinary skill in the art
having the benefit of the instant disclosure.
[0066] Dosage ranges for agents may be as low as 5 ng/d. In certain embodiments, about 10

[0068] In certain embodiments, the size of the active agent is important. In certain embodiments,
the active agent is less than about 3 pim, less than about 2 tim, less than about 1 im in diameter.
In certain embodiments, the active agent is from about 0.1 pim to about 3.0 pim in diameter. In
certain embodiments, the active agent is from about 0.5 pim to about 1.5 pim in diameter. In
certain embodiments, the active agent is about 0.2 pim, about 0.3 pim, about 0.4 pim, about 0.5

[0069] It may be advantageous for the pharmaceutical combination to be comprised of a
relatively large amount of the first component compared to the second component. In certain
instances, the ratio of the first active agent to second active agent is about 200:1, 190:1, 180:1,
170:1, 160:1, 150:1, 140:1, 130:1, 120:1, 110:1, 100:1, 90:1, 80:1, 70:1, 60:1, 50:1, 40:1, 30:1,
20:1, 15:1, 10:1, 9:1, 8:1, 7:1, 6:1, or 5:1. It further may be preferable to have a more equal
distribution of pharmaceutical agents. In certain instances, the ratio of the first active agent to the
second active agent is about 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, or 1:4. It also may be advantageous for
the pharmaceutical combination to have a relatively large amount of the second component
compared to the first component. In certain instances, the ratio of the second active agent to the
first active agent is about 30:1, 20:1, 15:1, 10:1, 9:1, 8:1, 7:1, 6:1, or 5:1. In certain instances, the
ratio of the second active agent to first active agent is about 100:1, 90:1, 80:1, 70:1, 60:1, 50:1,
or 40:1. In certain instances, the ratio of the second active agent to first active agent is about
200:1, 190:1, 180:1, 170:1, 160:1, 150:1, 140:1, 130:1, 120:1, or 110:1. A composition
comprising any of the above-identified combinations of first therapeutic agent and second

therapeutic agent may be administered in divided doses about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or more times per
day or in a form that will provide a rate of release effective to attain the desired results. The
dosage form may contain both the first and second active agents. The dosage form may be
administered one time per day if it contains both the first and second active agents.
[0070] For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain from
about 0.1 mg to about 5 g of the first therapeutic agent and about 0.1 mg to about 5 g of the
second therapeutic agent, both of which are compounded with an appropriate and convenient
amount of carrier material varying from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition.
Unit dosages will generally contain between about 0.5 mg to about 1500 mg of the first
therapeutic agent and 0.5 mg to about 1500 mg of the second therapeutic agent. The dosage may
be about 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, or 1000
mg, etc., up to about 1500 mg of the first therapeutic agent. The dosage may be about 25 mg, 50
mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, or 1 000 mg, etc., up to about
1500 mg of the second therapeutic agent.

[0071] As used herein, the following terms and phrases should have the meanings provided
below.
[0072] The indefinite articles "a" and "an," as used herein in the specification and in the claims,
unless clearly indicated to the contrary, should be understood to mean "at least one."
[0073] An "amyloidosis-associated condition" is a disease that is associated with amyloid
deposition and can include but not be limited to Alzheimer's Disease, idiopathetic myeloma,
amyloid polyneuropathy, amyloid cardiomyopathy, systemic senile amyloidosis, amyloid

macroglobulinemia-associated) A beta 2M (chronic hemodialysis), ATTR (familial amyloid
polyneuropathy (Portuguese, Japanese, Swedish)), familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (Danish),
isolated cardiac amyloid, systemic senile amyloidoses, AIAPP or amylin insulinoma, atrial
naturetic factor (isolated atrial amyloid), procalcitonin (medullary carcinoma of the thyroid),
gelsolin (familial amyloidosis (Finnish)), cystatin C (hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with

(accelerated senescence in mice), head injuries (traumatic brain injury), dementia, fibrinogen
associated amyloid; and Asor or Pr P-27 (scrapie, Creutzfeld Jacob disease, Gertsmann
Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, bovine spongiform encephalitis) or in cases of persons who are
homozygous for the apolipoprotein E4 allele, and the condition associated with homozygosity
for the apolipoprotein E4 allele or Huntington's disease.
[0074] "Amyloidosis" is a condition characterized by the accumulation of various insoluble,
fibrillar proteins in the tissues of a patient. An amyloid deposit is formed by the aggregation of
amyloid proteins, followed by the further combination of aggregates and/or amyloid proteins.
[0075] Many forms of amyloidosis exist, and the disease can be classified into four groups:
primary amyloidosis, secondary amyloidosis, hereditary amyloidosis, and amyloidosis associated
with normal aging. Primary amyloidosis (light chain amyloidosis) occurs with abnormalities of
plasma cells, and some people with primary amyloidosis also have multiple myeloma (cancer of
the plasma cells). Typical sites of amyloid buildup in primary amyloidosis are the heart, lungs,
skin, tongue, thyroid gland, intestines, liver, kidneys, and blood vessels. Secondary amyloidosis
may develop in response to various diseases that cause persistent infection or inflammation, such
as tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and familial Mediterranean fever. Typical sites of amyloid
buildup in secondary amyloidosis are the spleen, liver, kidneys, adrenal glands, and lymph nodes.
Hereditary amyloidosis has been noted in some families, particularly those from Portugal,
Sweden, and Japan. The amyloid-producing defect occurs because of mutations in specific
proteins in the blood. Typical sites for amyloid buildup in hereditary amyloidosis are the nerves,
heart, blood vessels, and kidneys.
[0076] The phrase "and/or," as used herein in the specification and in the claims, should be
understood to mean "either or both" of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are
conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Multiple elements
                                                   19

      WO 2014/066318                                                          PCT/US2013/066069
listed with "and/or" should be construed in the same fashion, i.e., "one or more" of the elements
so conjoined. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically
identified by the "and/or" clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically
identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to "A and/or B", when used in
conjunction with open-ended language such as "comprising" can refer, in one embodiment, to A
only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally
including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally
including other elements); etc.
[0077] As used herein in the specification and in the claims, "or" should be understood to have
the same meaning as "and/or" as defined above. For example, when separating items in a list,
"or" or "and/or" shall be interpreted as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least one, but also
including more than one, of a number or list of elements, and, optionally, additional unlisted
items. Only terms clearly indicated to the contrary, such as "only one of or "exactly one of," or,
when used in the claims, "consisting of," will refer to the inclusion of exactly one element of a
number or list of elements. In general, the term "or" as used herein shall only be interpreted as
indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e., "one or the other but not both") when preceded by terms of
exclusivity, such as "either," "one of," "only one of," or "exactly one of" "Consisting essentially
of," when used in the claims, shall have its ordinary meaning as used in the field of patent law.
[0078] As used herein in the specification and in the claims, the phrase "at least one," in
reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element
selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily
including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and
not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows
that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the
list of elements to which the phrase "at least one" refers, whether related or unrelated to those
elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, "at least one of A and B" (or,
equivalently, "at least one of A or B," or, equivalently "at least one of A and/or B") can refer, in
one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and
optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally
including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A);

in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least
one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.
[0079] It should also be understood that, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, in any methods
claimed herein that include more than one step or act, the order of the steps or acts of the method
is not necessarily limited to the order in which the steps or acts of the method are recited.
[0080] The terms "augmentation" or "augment" refer to combinations where one of the
compounds increases or enhances therapeutic effects of another compound or compounds
administered to a patient. In some instances, augmentation can result in improving the efficacy,
tolerability, or safety, or any combination thereof, of a particular therapy.
[0081] In the claims, as well as in the specification above, all transitional phrases such as
"comprising,"     "including,"    "carrying,"  "having,"   "containing,"    "involving,"   "holding,"
"composed of," and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but
not limited to. Only the transitional phrases "consisting of and "consisting essentially of shall
be closed or semi-closed transitional phrases, respectively, as set forth in the United States Patent
Office Manual of Patent Examining Procedures, Section 2111.03.
[0082] The definition of each expression, e.g., alkyl, m, n, and the like, when it occurs more than
once in any structure, is intended to be independent of its definition elsewhere in the same
structure.
[0083] A comprehensive list of the abbreviations utilized by organic chemists of ordinary skill in
the art appears in the first issue of each volume of the Journal of Organic Chemistry; this list is
typically presented in a table entitled Standard List of Abbreviations.

      WO 2014/066318                                                           PCT/US2013/066069
[0094]      The term "thioxo" refers to the group =S.
[0095]      The term "sulfinyl" refers to the group -S(=O)H.
[0096]      The term "sulfonyl" refers to the group -SO 2 H.
[0097]      The term "sulfonylamido" or "sulfonamide" refers to the group -SO 2 NH 2 .
[0098]      The term "sulfonate" refers to the group SO 3 H and includes groups having the
hydrogen     replaced  with,   for   example    a  C 1-6 alkyl group    ("alkylsulfonate"),   an  aryl
("arylsulfonate"), an aralkyl ("aralkylsulfonate") and so on. C 1 _3 sulfonates are preferred, such as
for example, SO 3Me, SO 3 Et and SO 3Pr.
[0099]      The term "isomers",       as used herein, refer to        stereoisomers,   diastereomers,
enantiomers and tautomers.      "Tautomers" may be isomers that are readily interconvertable by
rapid equilibrium.    For example, carbonyl compounds that have a hydrogen on their alpha
carbon are rapidly interconverted with their corresponding enols.
[00100]     As used herein, the terms "alkyl", "alkenyl", and the prefix "alk-" are inclusive of
straight chain groups and branched chain groups and cyclic groups, e.g., cycloalkyl and
cycloalkenyl. Unless otherwise specified, these groups contain from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, with
alkenyl groups containing from 2 to 20 carbon atoms. In some embodiments, these groups have a
total of at most 10 carbon atoms, at most 8 carbon atoms, at most 6 carbon atoms, or at most 4
carbon atoms. Cyclic groups can be monocyclic or polycyclic and preferably have from 3 to 10
ring   carbon atoms.     Exemplary     cyclic  groups include     cyclopropyl,    cyclopropylmethyl,
cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, adamantyl, and substituted and unsubstituted bomyl, norbomyl, and
norbomenyl.
[00101]     The term "heterocyclic" includes cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl non-aromatic rings or
ring systems that contain at least one ring heteroatom (e.g., 0, S, N).
[00102]     Unless otherwise specified, "alkylene" and "alkenylene" are the divalent forms of the
"alkyl" and "alkenyl" groups defined above. The terms, "alkylenyl" and "alkenylenyl" are used
when "alkylene" and "alkenylene", respectively, are substituted. For example, an arylalkylenyl
group comprises an alkylene moiety to which an aryl group is attached.
[00103]     The term "haloalkyl" is inclusive of groups that are substituted by one or more
halogen atoms, including perfluorinated groups. This is also true of other groups that include the
prefix "halo-". Examples of suitable haloalkyl groups are difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and
the like. "Halogens" are elements including chlorine, bromine, fluorine, and iodine.
                                                  22

     WO 2014/066318                                                           PCT/US2013/066069
[00104]     The term "aryl" as used herein includes monocyclic or polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons or ring systems. Examples of aryl groups include phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl,
fluorenyl and indenyl. Aryl groups may be substituted or unsubstituted. Aryl groups include
aromatic annulenes, fused aryl groups, and heteroaryl groups. Aryl groups are also referred to
herein as aryl rings.
[00105]     Unless otherwise indicated, the term "heteroatom" refers to the atoms 0, S, or N.
[00106]     The term "heteroaryl" includes aromatic rings or ring systems that contain at least one
ring heteroatom (e.g., 0, S, N). In some embodiments, the term "heteroaryl" includes a ring or
ring system that contains 2 to 12 carbon atoms, 1 to 3 rings, 1 to 4 heteroatoms, and 0, S, and/or
N as the heteroatoms. Suitable heteroaryl groups include furyl, thienyl, pyridyl, quinolinyl,
isoquinolinyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, triazolyl, pyrrolyl, tetrazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, oxazolyl,
thiazolyl, benzofuranyl, benzothiophenyl, carbazolyl, benzoxazolyl, pyrimidinyl, benzimidazolyl,
quinoxalinyl, benzothiazolyl, naphthyridinyl, isoxazolyl, isothiazolyl, purinyl, quinazolinyl,
pyrazinyl, 1-oxidopyridyl, pyridazinyl, triazinyl, tetrazinyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, and so on.
[00107]     The terms "arylene" and "heteroarylene" are the divalent forms of the "aryl" and
"heteroaryl" groups defined above. The terms "arylenyl" and "heteroarylenyl" are used when
"arylene" and "heteroarylene", respectively, are substituted. For example, an alkylarylenyl group
comprises an arylene moiety to which an alkyl group is attached.
[00108]     The term "fused aryl ring" includes fused carbocyclic aromatic rings or ring systems.
Examples of fused aryl rings include benzo, naphtho, fluoreno, and indeno.
[00109]     The term "annulene" refers to aryl groups that are completely conjugated monocyclic
hydrocarbons. Examples of annulenes include cyclobutadiene, benzene, and cyclooctatetraene.
Annulenes present in an aryl group will typically have one or more hydrogen atoms substituted
with other atoms such as carbon.
[00110]     When a group is present more than once in any formula or scheme described herein,
each group (or substituent) is independently selected, whether explicitly stated or not. For
example, for the formula -C(O)NR 2 each of the two R groups is independently selected.
[00111]     As a means of simplifying the discussion and the recitation of certain terminology
used throughout this application, the terms "group" and "moiety" are used to differentiate
between chemical species that allow for substitution or that may be substituted and those that, in
the particular embodiment of the invention, do not so allow for substitution or may not be so
                                                  23

     WO 2014/066318                                                           PCT/US2013/066069
substituted. Thus, when the term "group" is used to describe a chemical substituent, the
described chemical material includes the unsubstituted group and that group with nonperoxidic 0,
N, S, Si, or F atoms, for example, in the chain as well as carbonyl groups or other conventional
substituents. Where the term "moiety" is used to describe a chemical compound or substituent,
only an unsubstituted chemical material is intended to be included. For example, the phrase
"alkyl group" is intended to include not only pure open chain saturated hydrocarbon alkyl
substituents, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, tert-butyl, and the like, but also alkyl substituents
bearing further substituents known in the art, such as hydroxy, alkoxy, alkylsulfonyl, halogen
atoms, cyano, nitro, amino, carboxyl, etc. Thus, "alkyl group" includes ether groups, haloalkyls,
nitroalkyls, carboxyalkyls, hydroxyalkyls, sulfoalkyls, etc. On the other hand, the phrase "alkyl
moiety" is limited to the inclusion of only pure open chain saturated hydrocarbon alkyl
substituents, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, tert-butyl, and the like.
[00112]     The invention is inclusive         of the compounds        described herein    (including
intermediates) in any of their pharmaceutically acceptable forms, including isomers (e.g.,
diastereomers and enantiomers), tautomers, salts, solvates, polymorphs, prodrugs, and the like. In
particular, if a compound is optically active, the invention specifically includes each of the
compound's enantiomers as well as racemic mixtures of the enantiomers. It should be understood
that the term "compound" includes any or all of such forms, whether explicitly stated or not
(although at times, "salts" are explicitly stated).
[00113]     "Pharmaceutically acceptable" as used herein means that the compound or
composition or carrier is suitable for administration to a subject to achieve the treatments
described herein, without unduly deleterious side effects in light of the necessity of the treatment.
[00114]     The term "therapeutically effective amount" or "pharmaceutically appropriate
dosage", as used herein, refers to the amount of the compounds or dosages that will elicit the
biological or medical response of a subject, tissue or cell that is being sought by the researcher,
veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.
[00115]     As used herein, "pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier" includes any and all dry
powder, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic agents,
absorption delaying agents, and the like. Pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers are materials,
useful for the purpose of administering the compounds in the method of the present invention,
which are preferably non-toxic, and may be solid, liquid, or gaseous materials, which are
                                                    24

otherwise inert and pharmaceutically acceptable, and are compatible with the compounds of the
present invention. Examples of such carriers include oils such as com oil, buffers such as PBS,
saline, polyethylene glycol, glycerin, polypropylene glycol, dimethylsulfoxide, an amide such as
dimethylacetamide, a protein such as albumin, and a detergent such as Tween 80, mono- and
oligopolysaccharides such as glucose, lactose, cyclodextrins and starch.
[00116]      The term "administering" or "administration", as used herein, refers to providing the
compound or pharmaceutical composition of the invention to a subject suffering from or at risk
of the diseases or conditions to be treated or prevented.
[00117]      The term "systemic delivery", as used herein, refers to any suitable administration
methods which may delivery the compounds in the present invention systemically.                In one
embodiment, systemic delivery may be selected from the group consisting of oral, parenteral,
intranasal, inhaler, sublingual, rectal, and transdermal administrations.
[00118]      A route of administration in pharmacology and toxicology is the path by which a drug,
fluid, poison, or other substance is taken into the body.        Routes of administration may be
generally classified by the location at which the substance is applied. Common examples may
include oral and intravenous administration. Routes can also be classified based on where the
target of action is. Action may be topical (local), enteral (system-wide effect, but delivered
through the gastrointestinal tract), or parenteral (systemic action, but delivered by routes other
than the GI tract).
[00119]      A topical administration emphasizes local effect, and substance is applied directly
where its action is desired. Sometimes, however, the term topical may be defined as applied to a
localized area of the body or to the surface of a body part, without necessarily involving target
effect of the substance, making the classification rather a variant of the classification based on
application location.    In an enteral administration, the desired effect is systemic (non-local),
substance is given via the digestive tract. In a parenteral administration, the desired effect is
systemic, and substance is given by routes other than the digestive tract.
[00120]      The examples for topical administrations may include epicutaneous (application onto
the skin), e.g., allergy testing or typical local anesthesia, inhalational, e.g. asthma medications,
enema, e.g., contrast media for imaging of the bowel, eye drops (onto the conjunctiva), e.g.,
antibiotics for conjunctivitis, ear drops, such as antibiotics and corticosteroids for otitis externa,
and those through mucous membranes in the body.

[00121]     Enteral administration may be administration that involves any part of the
gastrointestinal tract and has systemic effects.       The examples may include those by mouth
(orally), many drugs as tablets, capsules, or drops, those by gastric feeding tube, duodenal
feeding tube, or gastrostomy, many drugs and enteral nutrition, and those rectally, various drugs
in suppository.
[00122]     The examples for parenteral administrations may include intravenous (into a vein),
e.g. many drugs, total parenteral nutrition intra-arterial (into an artery), e.g., vasodilator drugs in
the treatment of vasospasm and thrombolytic drugs for treatment of embolism, intraosseous
infusion (into the bone marrow),        intra-muscular, intracerebral (into the brain parenchyma),
intracerebroventricular (into cerebral ventricular system), intrathecal (an injection into the spinal
canal), and subcutaneous (under the skin).       Among them, intraosseous infusion is, in effect, an
indirect intravenous access because the bone marrow drains directly into the venous system.
Intraosseous infusion may be occasionally used for drugs and fluids in emergency medicine and
pediatrics when intravenous access is difficult.
[00123]     Any route of administration may be suitable for the present invention.              In one
embodiment, the compound of the present invention may be administered to the subject via
intravenous injection. In another embodiment, the compounds of the present invention may be
administered to the subject via any other suitable sytemic deliveries, such as oral, parenteral,
intranasal, sublingual, rectal, or transdermal administrations.
[00124]     In another embodiment, the compounds of the present invention may be administered
to the subject via nasal systems or mouth through, e.g., inhalation.
[00125]     In another embodiment, the compounds of the present invention may be administered
to the subject via intraperitoneal injection or IP injection.
[00126]     As used herein, the term "intraperitoneal injection" or "IP injection" refers to the
injection of a substance into the peritoneum (body cavity). IP injection is more often applied to
animals than to humans. In general, IP injection may be preferred when large amounts of blood
replacement fluids are needed, or when low blood pressure or other problems prevent the use of
a suitable blood vessel for intravenous injection.
[00127]     In animals, IP injection is used predominantly in veterinary medicine and animal
testing for the administration of systemic drugs and fluids due to the ease of administration
compared with other parenteral methods.

[00128]     In humans, the method of IP injection is widely used to administer chemotherapy
drugs to treat some cancers, in particular ovarian cancer. Although controversial, this specific
use has been recommended as a standard of care.
[00129]         Certain compounds contained in compositions of the present invention may exist
in particular geometric or stereoisomeric forms. In addition, polymers of the present invention
may also be optically active. The present invention contemplates all such compounds, including
cis- and trans-isomers, R- and S-enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)-isomers, the
racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, as falling within the scope of the invention.
Additional asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All
such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention.
[00130]         If, for instance, a particular enantiomer of compound of the present invention is
desired, it may be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, or by derivation with a chiral auxiliary,
where the resulting diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group cleaved to
provide the pure desired enantiomers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic
functional group, such as amino, or an acidic functional group, such as carboxyl, diastereomeric
salts are formed with an appropriate optically-active acid or base, followed by resolution of the
diastereomers thus formed by fractional crystallization or chromatographic means well known in
the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantiomers.
[00131]         It will be understood that "substitution" or "substituted with" includes the implicit
proviso that such substitution is in accordance with permitted valence of the substituted atom and
the substituent, and that the substitution results in a stable compound, e.g., which does not
spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, or
other reaction.
[00132]         The term "substituted" is also contemplated to include all permissible substituents
of organic compounds. In a broad aspect, the permissible substituents include acyclic and cyclic,
branched and unbranched, carbocyclic and heterocyclic, aromatic and nonaromatic substituents
of organic compounds. Illustrative substituents include, for example, those described herein
above. The permissible substituents may be one or more and the same or different for appropriate
organic compounds. For purposes of this invention, the heteroatoms such as nitrogen may have
hydrogen substituents and/or any permissible substituents of organic compounds described
                                                  27

herein which satisfy the valences of the heteroatoms. This invention is not intended to be limited
in any manner by the permissible substituents of organic compounds.
[00133]         For purposes of this invention, the chemical elements are identified in accordance
with the Periodic Table of the Elements, CAS version, "Handbook of Chemistry and Physics",
67th Ed., 1986-87, inside cover.
[00134]         As used herein, the term "subject" or "individual" refers to a human or other
vertebrate animal. It is intended that the term encompass "patients."
[00135]         The term "synergistic" refers to a combination which is more effective than the
additive effects of any two or more single agents. A synergistic effect permits the effective
treatment of a disease using lower amounts (doses) of individual therapy. The lower doses result
in lower toxicity without reduced efficacy. In addition, a synergistic effect can result in improved
efficacy. Finally, synergy may result in an improved avoidance or reduction of disease as
compared to any single therapy.
[00136]         Combination therapy can allow for the product of lower doses of the first
therapeutic or the second therapeutic agent (referred to as "apparent one-way synergy" herein),
or lower doses of both therapeutic agents (referred to as "two-way synergy" herein) than would
normally be required when either drug is used alone.
[00137]         As used herein, "pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier" includes any and all
solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic agents,
absorption delaying agents, and the like. Pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers are materials,
useful for the purpose of administering the compounds in the method of the present invention,
which are preferably non-toxic, and may be solid, liquid, or gaseous materials, which are
otherwise inert and pharmaceutically acceptable, and are compatible with the compounds of the
present invention. Examples of such carriers include oils such as com oil, buffers such as PBS,
saline, polyethylene glycol, glycerin, polypropylene glycol, dimethylsulfoxide, an amide such as
dimethylacetamide, a protein such as albumin, and a detergent such as Tween 80, mono- and
oligopolysaccharides such as glucose, lactose, cyclodextrins and starch.
[00138]         The formulation used in the present invention may also contain stabilizers,
preservatives, buffers, antioxidants, or other additives known to those of skill in the art. The use
of such media and agents for pharmaceutically-active substances is well known in the art.
Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the imaging agent of the
                                                  28

invention. The imaging agent of the invention may further be administered to an individual in an
appropriate diluent or adjuvant, co-administered with enzyme inhibitors or in an appropriate
carrier such as human serum albumin or liposomes. Pharmaceutically-acceptable diluents include
sterile saline and other aqueous buffer solutions. Adjuvants contemplated herein include
resorcinols, non-ionic surfactants       such as polyoxyethylene        oleyl ether and n-hexadecyl
polyethylene ether. Enzyme inhibitors include pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, diethylpyrocarbonate,
and trasylol. Liposomes inhibitors include water-in-oil-in-water CGF emulsions, as well as
conventional liposomes (see J. Neuroimmunol. 1984, 7, 27).
[00139]          As described herein, certain embodiments of the present compounds may contain
a basic functional group, such as amino or alkylamino, and are, thus, capable of forming
pharmaceutically-acceptable        salts  with    pharmaceutically-acceptable        acids.   The   term
"pharmaceutically-acceptable salts" in this respect, refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic
and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can be
prepared in situ in the administration vehicle or the dosage form manufacturing process, or by
separately reacting a purified compound of the invention in its free base form with a suitable
organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed during subsequent purification.
Representative salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate,
nitrate, acetate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate,
citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, naphthylate, mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactobionate,
and laurylsulphonate salts and the like. See J. Pharm. Sci. 1977, 66, 1-19.
[00140]          The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the subject compounds include the
conventional nontoxic salts or quaternary ammonium salts of the compounds, e.g., from non
toxic organic or inorganic acids. For example, such conventional nontoxic salts include those
derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric,
nitric, and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic,
glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, palmitic, maleic, hydroxymaleic,
phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicyclic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic,
methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isothionic, and the like.
[00141]          In other cases, the compounds of the present invention may contain one or more
acidic functional groups and, thus, are capable of forming pharmaceutically-acceptable salts with
pharmaceutically-acceptable      bases. The term "pharmaceutically-acceptable            salts" in these
                                                    29

instances refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic base addition salts of
compounds of the present invention. These salts can likewise be prepared in situ in the
administration vehicle or the dosage form manufacturing process, or by separately reacting the
purified compound in its free acid form with a suitable base, such as the hydroxide, carbonate or
bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically-acceptable         metal   cation, with ammonia, or with        a
pharmaceutically-acceptable organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Representative alkali
or alkaline earth salts include the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and
aluminum salts and the like. Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base
addition salts include ethylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine,
piperazine and the like. (See, for example, J. Pham. Sci. 1977., supra)
[00142]         More specifically, the compounds that can be formulated into a pharmaceutical
composition include a therapeutically-effective amount of the first compound, a therapeutically
effective amount of the second compound, and a pharmaceutically-acceptable            carrier. The
therapeutically-effective amount of the compounds and the specific pharmaceutically-acceptable
carrier will vary depending upon, e.g., the age, weight, sex of the subject, the mode of
administration, and the type of viral condition being treated.
[00143]         In a particular aspect, the pharmaceutical composition which can be used includes
the compounds of the present invention in effective unit dosage form. As used herein, the term
"effective unit dosage" or "effective unit dose" is used herein to mean a predetermined amount
sufficient to be effective against AD or the like. Examples include amounts that enable treatment
of amyloid deposit(s) in vivo or in vitro that yield acceptable toxicity and bioavailability levels
for pharmaceutical use, and/or prevent cell degeneration and toxicity associated with fibril
formation.
[00144]         The pharmaceutical compositions may contain the first compound or the second
compound used in the method of this invention in an amount of from 0.01 to 99% by weight of
the total composition, preferably 0.1 to 80% by weight of the total composition. For oral
administration, the first compound or the second compound is generally administered in an
amount of 0.1 g/body to 15 g/body, preferably 0.5 g/body to 5 g/body. For intravenous injection,
the dose may be about 0.1 to about 30 mg/kg/day, preferably about 0.5 to about 10 mg/kg/day. If
applied topically as a liquid, ointment, or cream, the first compound or the second compound

may be present in an amount of about 0.1 to about 50 mg/mL, preferably about 0.5 to 30 mg/mL
of the composition.
[00145]        For systemic administration, the daily dosage as employed for adult human
treatment will range from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 150 mg/kg, preferably about 0.2 mg/kg to
about 80 mg/kg.

[00147]        Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than
routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments of the invention
described herein. Such equivalents are intended to be encompassed by the following claims.
                                          EXAMPLES
[00148]        It should be understood that the above-described embodiments and the following
examples are given by way of illustration, not limitation. Various changes and modifications
within the scope of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the
present description.
Example 1
[00149]        Cromolyn and Ibuprofen combination treatment
[00150]        The following is a dosing example calculation for cromolyn:
        1.     Effective comolyn administration for AD treatment is significantly different from
               that of cromolyn for lung inflammation and asthma. For lung inflammation or
               asthma subjects use inhalation devices 1-4 times per day; each inhaled dose
               contains 20 mg of dry powder.
        2.     The dry cromolyn powder (usual size is >5 microns) is formulated with lactose
               with much larger size.
                                                 31

      WO 2014/066318                                                         PCT/US2013/066069
         3.      When inhaled, dry cromolyn powder is separated from the lactose via the inhaler
                 device action (spinhaler, cyclohaler, or monodose inhalers) or in the upper part of
                 the airway and the dry cromolyn is delivered to the lung.
         4.      Cromolyn has also been delivered as a solution that enters via the gastric system.
[00151]          For AD, these treatments will not result in any significant action on AD
progression or modification.
[00152]          For AD treatment, to be effective, the drug has to be delivered systemically to
allow for brain uptake. Therfore, cromolyn dry powder has to be <3 microns. In certain
embodiments, cromolyn is from about 0.5 microns to about 1.5 microns in diameter. Powders of
this size will reach the alvular nodes and be delivered systemically.
[00153]          The estimated dose for daily treatment is about 16 mg per subject per day, about 4
mg per subject per day, or about 1 mg per subject per day.
[00154]          From a preliminary biodistribution of a cromolyn analog labeled with F-18, the
brain uptake is about 1%dose per gram in the brain. Therfore, it is estimated that from a 16 mg
dose, for 1 mg taken systematically, 0.01 mg will be taken in the brain. The estimated dose per
gram of brain will be 0.01/1500 gram (average brain mass); this equals 7 ng/gram of brain. This
amount slows down polymerization of the daily Ap peptide produced in the brain. Therefore,
amounts that are 5 times lower than the 80 mg used for asthma treatment, should be effective.
Cromolyn has a LogP of 1.9, PSA                 of 189,    and %PSA of 44 (JOURNAL                OF
PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, VOL. 92, NO. 6, JUNE 2003).
[00155]          Inhibition data showed that cromolyn inhibits Ap peptide polymerization by 8
fold. Other inhibition experiments showed that cromolyn inhibits Ap peptide polymerization in 5
nM concentrations.
[00156]          In combination with cromolyn, a dose of 2 mg of ibuprofen could be given as pill,
capsule, or liquid. This low dose of ibuprofen is sufficient to treat the invisible inflammation
response to the AP peptide. Higher doses may work initially but may worsen the AD subjects in
the long run.

[00158]     Three mice groups (five animals in each) were tested in a Morris water navigation test.
Two groups were four months young APP/PS1 including a mutant AP mouse and a model
indicative of Alzheimer's Disease progression. One APP/PS 1 group was treated with Cromolyn
and ibuprofen combination for six months, and the second was untreated as an control group and
a third untreated wild type was used as a normal control. Figure 1 is a graph showing the in-vivo
study summary. WT (wild type, right panel) shows normal untreated mice. The control group
(left panel) shows transgenic mice that did not received drug treatment. The treated group (Mid
panel) shows transgenic mice that received AZLT-OP1(cromolyn + ibuprofen) for six month by
Intraperitoneal (IP) injection twice weekly.     Mice were trained for 7 days to remember the
location of the platform. At day 8, the platform was removed, and the times of crossing the
platform area was recorded.
[00159]     In another study, 7.5 month old APP/PS1 mice completed treated for a week as an
acute treatment using three different doses of Cromolyn Sodium (1.05 mg/kg, 2.1 mg/kg and
3.15 mg/kg). The treatment was given by IP injection everyday for 7 days before sacrificing the
mice and harvesting the brain.     Brain extracts were quantified for the total amount of Aj40,
Aj42 and AP oligomers.        Figure 4 depicts the results of in vivo cromolyn and ibuprofen
treatment of transgenic mice modeling like Alzheimer' Disease.
[00160]     Here are the main conclusions of this acute study:
[00161]          1.     A dose-dependent decrease in the amount of AP40 and A42 associated
with the two higher doses (2.1 mg/kg and 3.15 mg/kg), up to 50% was observed.
[00162]          2      This effect was sustained after treatment of the samples with guanidine
HCl to dissolve any amyloid aggregates.
[00163]          3      The quantification of oligomeric species using the 82E1/82E1 ELISA kit
failed to show any difference among the experimental groups.
[0002]      One explanation to the insignificant change is that acute exposure to Cromolyn
Sodium treatment primarily affects monomeric species, impacting oligomers or higher-order
aggregates chronic longer treatment term. Acute treatment would not cause a substantial change
in the oligomeric quantities.

[00164]     Cromolyn derivatives for inhibiting polymerization of Alzheimer's Disease oligomers
and treating Alzheimer's Disease.
[00165]     In another experiment, cromolyn derivatives were tested as inhibitors of           AP
polymerization.    Inhibiting AP oligomer production will provide of Alzheimer's Disease and
treating Alzheimer's Disease.
[00166]     The investigational product ALZT-OP 1a (cromolyn sodium) is a synthetic chromone
derivative that has been approved for use by the FDA since the 1970s for the treatment of asthma.
For asthma treatment, cromolyn sodium powder was micronized for inhalation to the lungs via
dry powder inhaler, i.e. the Spinhaler device.      Liquid intranasal and ophthalmic formulations
have also been developed for the treatment of rhinitis and conjunctivitis.
[00167]     The mechanism of action for cromolyn sodium (ALZT-OPla) is characterized as a
mast cell stabilizer, namely to suppress cytokine release from activated lymphocytes together
with preventing the release of histamine from mast cells (Netzer, 2012; Keller, 2011). It was
administered four times daily as prophylaxis for allergic and exercise-induced asthma, not as a
treatment for acute attacks.
[00168]     Applicants have discovered a new mechanism of action for cromolyn, which, along
with its role for suppressing immune responses, enables the re-purposing of this approved drug
for use to halt AD progression. The Applicants' studies have shown that cromolyn sodium binds
to beta-amyloid peptides and inhibits its polymerization into oligomers and higher order
aggregates.     The inhibition of beta-amyloid polymerization will arrest amyloid-mediated
intoxication of neurons and restore the passage of these aberrant beta-amyloid oligomers out of
the brain rather than their accumulation.
[00169]     Applicants' studies showed that cromolyn or its derivatives penetrates the blood-brain
barrier in animal models, so that plasma bioavailability following cromolyn inhalation will
translate to concentrations in the brain sufficient to interfere with beta-amyloid oligomerization
and accumulation.     Inhalation of cromolyn sodium was shown to be the most effective non
injected administration route for systemic bioavailability of cromolyn sodium in animals and
humans (Moss, 1970; Neale, 1986; Richards, 1987; Aswania, 1999; Tronde,2003). An FDA
approved route of administration for cromolyn sodium is oral inhalation using a capsule-based
dry powder inhaler, with 20 mg cromolyn sodium loaded per capsule. Studies have shown that
with high inspiratory rates, the inhaled cromolyn sodium is delivered efficiently to the human
                                                 34

     WO 2014/066318                                                         PCT/US2013/066069
lung, with 10-15% of the inhaled drug-delivered-dose absorbed into the bloodstream (Richards,
1987; Keller, 2011). For these reasons, cromolyn sodium inhalation with a dry powder inhaler
device was selected as the route of administration in the present invention. However, plasma
levels of cromolyn following inhalation are reported to show high intra- and inter-subject
variability, and that cromolyn uptake by asthmatics was lower than in healthy volunteers
(Richards, 1987; Keller, 2011).
[00170]     For planned human studies, each blister will contain the active product ingredient
(cromolyn sodium) and inhalation grade lactose monohydrate as an excipient. The once-daily
cromolyn dose to be tested in this study is less than 20% the dose from the four-times daily
approved dose level (80 mg cromolyn sodium total per day) for the treatment of asthma.
[00171]     Taken together, the once daily ALZT-OPla dose in this study should preserve the
drug's excellent safety and tolerability profile, yet is predicted to achieve the nanomolar drug
concentrations needed to block beta-amyloid oligomerization in the brain to prevent Alzheimer's
disease progression.
Example 4.
[00172]     Cromolyn derivatives for inhibiting polymerization of Alzheimer's Disease oligomers.
[00173]     Figure 5 illustrates the measurement of TBS soluble AP level by WAKO ELISA.
The experiments show that TBS AP level decreases following by treatment of cromolyn sodium
with dose-dependency. Figure 5A shows that AP40 level decreases following by treatment of
cromolyn sodium with dose-dependency. Figure 5B shows that A42 level decreases following
by treatment of cromolyn sodium with dose-dependency. As indicated, the number of animals
per group is N= 3 or 5, average ± SE. The p value is significant using one-way ANOVA test
(Bonferroni's test).   Both of total soluble AP [as shown as Gdn+ (Guanidine-HCl )] and
monomeric AP [as shown as Gdn-( no guanidine)] decease after the addition of cromolyn sodium.
The dose of 2.1 mg/kg of cromolyn sodium was enough to decrease TBS soluble AP.
[0003]      Figure 6 illustrates the measurement of TBS soluble AP oligomer level IBL oligomer
ELISA (82El-82E1). The experiments show that AP oligomer level was not changed following

[00174]    Discussion
[00175]    Applicants summarize the rationale behind the treatment as follows:
[00176]     1. Molecular structure is similar to some that had affinity to plaque (Foruma I and
table 1). The significant difference is that the drug in the present invention works in nanomolar
concentrations as compared to micromolar concentrations of other previous drugs.

[00180]      5. The binding of cromolyn to AP and its polymerization inhibition was confirmed
by four independent methods.
[00181]      UV aggregation assay.
[00182]      Abeta peptide aggregation and the impact of drugs to slow or prevent Abeta
aggregation was measured by a UV absorbance assay (Findeis, 1999). Abeta (1-40) peptides, at
50 piM, were mixed with 50 piM drug in assay buffer and the plate was incubated at ambient
temperature on a plate reader. The UV absorbance was monitored at 540 nm over a 2-3h period.
[00183]      Polymerization of Ap-monomer peptides into clusters of trimers and tetramers
initiates the AP aggregation process into protofibrils and then into fibrils that form amyloid
plaques.      The polymerization experiments revealed that AP monomer reached 50%
polymerization in 14 minutes. At equimolar concentrations with A, the addition of cromolyn
inhibited the rate of AP polymerization 7-fold, namely 50% polymerization required 75 minutes
incubation, compared to 14 minutes in the absence of drug.

[00184]      LC/MS/MS binding assay.
[00185]      Binding was measured by equilibrium dialysis. Amyloid fibrils were preformed by
incubating the peptide in buffer with shaking for 120h at 270 C. The drugs were incubated with
                                                 38

fibrils (50 piM peptide) in a RED equilibrium dialysis device (Pierce), and the amount of test
agent on each side is determined by LC/MS/MS. Percent bound was calculated as 1 - (free
conc/total conc) after correcting for background signal. Thioflavin-T was used as a positive
control. Binding is displacement of Thioflavin T. Polymerization is ranked for relative Ap. In
general, compounds that rank highly in inhibiting polymerization rank low in binding to
aggregates, and vice versa.
[00186]     Competition binding assay.
[00187]     The competition assay was performed as described previously (Ono and Hayashi,
2009). Amyloid peptide aggregates were preformed by incubating AP (1-40) peptide with buffer
for 3 days at 37'C. Drugs at 20 [tM were mixed with assay solution containing 10 ptg/nL
amyloid peptide aggregates + 3 [tM Thioflavin-T on one side of a RED dialysis device with
assay buffer added to the other side.      After 4h dialysis, the amount of Thioflavin-T was
determined by LC/MS/MS. The relative binding was determined by normalizing the percent
binding by the percent binding of the vehicle control.
[00188]     AP aggregation by thioflavin T assay
[00189]     One of the most routinely used approaches to monitor AP polymerization is the
thioflavin T binding assay. When thioflavin T binds to beta-sheet rich structures, such as
amyloid aggregates, the dye displays enhanced fluorescence and a characteristic red shift in its
emission spectrum.    AP peptide at 5 jiM was mixed with 10 piM thioflavin T with drug at
different concentrations. In the absence of drug, AP polymerization shows increasing thioflavin
T fluorescence over 60-180 min, as shown in Figure 5.
[00190]     The addition of cromolyn (C0399) and its      18F derivative (TS734) at nanomolar
concentration shows inhibition of AP aggregation, as shown in Figure 6.
[00191]     By four separate in vitro assays, cromolyn sodium, at nanomolar concentrations,
effectively inhibits AP amyloid peptide polymerization into oligomers and higher order
aggregates.

after cromolyn binds AP through a binding model simulation.
[00193]     7. Applicants tested several other structures for treating AD in addition to cromolyn.
Several types of compounds for both imaging and therapeutic agents have been evaluated for AP
peptide polymerization inhibition.
[00194]     In an effort to combine bioavailability and dual function, Applicants have tethered
scyllo-inositol, which is transported across the blood-brain barrier and known to bind and
neutralize oligomers into soluble complexes (McLaurin, Kierstead, et al., 2006; Sun, Zhang, et
al., 2008), to 2-ethyl-8-methyl-2,8-diazospiro-4,5-decan-1,3-dione,     a muscarinic M1 receptor
agonist (Palacios, Bolliger, et al., 1986). RS-86 was chosen because evidence has shown that it
improves cognitive function, mood and social behavior in some AD patients (Wettstein and
Spiegel, 1985). M2 receptors function in cholinergic nerve terminals to regulate the release of
acetylcholine, whereas M1 receptors are located on postsynaptic cells and facilitate cellular
excitation (Mash, Flynn, 1985). Since presynaptic cholinergic neurons degenerate in AD while
postsynaptic M1 muscarinic receptors remain in tact, the use of long-acting muscarinic agonists
like RS-86 has been proposed as a treatment strategy for memory loss. However, RS86 has low
brain penetration; combining it with inositol using a linkage which can be metabolized once in
the brain may increase bioavailability of the agonist as well as maintaining the beneficial effect
of inositol.   In the past, both inositol, in the form of 1-fluoro-scyllo-inositol, and RS-86
derivatives have been radiolabeled with F-18 or C-I1 as potential PET probes for AD.

[00195]     8.  It is believed that these suitable compounds target mast cells by inhibiting
cytokine production therefore an additional treatment the inflammatory response associated with
the AD trigger and process. In their previous publication (Jin, Silverman, et al. 2009), Jin and
co-workers indicate that the potential cromolyn compounds can be used as a Mast cell inhibitors.
Example 6.
[00196]     Non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs (NSAIDs).
[00197]     Compelling evidence from multiple epidemiology studies revealed that long-term
dosing with non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs (NSAIDs) dramatically reduced AD risk in the
elderly, including delayed disease onset, reduced symptomatic severity and slowed cognitive
decline (Veld, 2001; Etminan, 2003; Imbimbo, 2010). Three mechanisms have been proposed
how NSAIDs inhibit the processes that contribute to AD progression: i) by inhibiting COX
activity to reduce or prevent microglial activation and cytokine production in the brain
(Mackenzie, 1998; Alafuzoff, 2000; Yan, 2003; Gasparini, 2004; Imbimbo, 2010); ii) by
reducing amyloid deposition (Weggen, 2001; Yan, 2003; Imbimbo, 2010); or iii) by blocking
COX-mediated prostaglandin E2 responses in synapses (Kotilinek, 2008).
[00198]     Therefore, NSAIDs are predicted to dampen the neuro-inflammatory response and
impact AD progression via several mechanisms. When administered together with drugs that
inhibit beta-amyloidoligomerization,    the combination treatment paradigm is proposed to
                                                41

     WO 2014/066318                                                        PCT/US2013/066069
attenuate the multiple triggers leading to neurodegeneration and neuronal death. The decline in
cognitive performance may be reversed, due to neuronal plasticity and neurogenesis in the
hippocampus (Kohman, 2013), if AD progression is arrested at a very early stage.
[00199]     Ibuprofen.
[00200]     Ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor for treating inflammation as a non
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).      The COX enzymes convert certain fatty acids to
prostaglandins.    The prostaglandins at the end of the "chain" of reactions that starts with the
COX enzyme cause an increased sensitivity to pain, fever, and vasodilation (increased blood
flow or inflammation).    By inhibiting the start of this chain of reactions, ibuprofen therefore
reduces pain, fever, and inflammation.     Because ibuprofen blocks the activity of both COX
enzymes, it is considered a non-selective COX inhibitor NSAID.
[00201]     ALZT-OP1 therapy for the treatment of individuals with amnestic mild cognitive
impairment.     ALZT-OP1 is a multi-functional drug therapy consisting of cromolyn sodium
(ALZT-OP 1a) administered by inhalation to inhibit beta-amyloid peptide polymerization and to
dampen immune responses, plus a concomitant but separately administered low dose oral
ibuprofen tablet (ALZT-OPlb) to inhibit the neuro-inflammatory response in persons with
confirmed amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) due to Alzheimer's disease. Both active
pharmaceutical ingredient (API) drugs in this ALZT-OP1 formulation are approved, marketed
drugs that have been re-purposed for use to prevent the onset of dementia and Alzheimer's
disease progression.
[00202]     ALZT-OPla
[00203]     The investigational product ALZT-OPla (cromolyn sodium) is a synthetic chromone
derivative that has been approved for use by the FDA since the 1970s for the treatment of asthma.
For asthma treatment, cromolyn sodium powder was micronized for inhalation to the lungs via
dry powder inhaler, i.e., the Spinhaler device.   Liquid intranasal and ophthalmic formulations
have also been developed for the treatment of rhinitis and conjunctivitis.
[00204]     The mechanism of action for cromolyn sodium (ALZT-OPla) is characterized as a
mast cell stabilizer, namely to suppress cytokine release from activated lymphocytes together
with preventing the release of histamine from mast cells (Netzer, 2012; Keller, 2011). It was
                                                42

      WO 2014/066318                                                        PCT/US2013/066069
administered four times daily as prophylaxis for allergic and exercise-induced asthma, not as a
treatment for acute attacks.
[00205]     We have discovered a new mechanism of action for cromolyn, which, along with its
role for suppressing immune responses, enables the re-purposing of this approved drug for use to
halt AD progression. Our studies have shown that cromolyn sodium binds to beta-amyloid
peptides and inhibits its polymerization into oligomers and higher order aggregates. The
inhibition of beta-amyloid polymerization will arrest amyloid-mediated intoxication of neurons
and restore the passage of these aberrant beta-amyloid oligomers out of the brain rather than their
accumulation.
[00206]     Our studies showed that cromolyn penetrates the blood-brain barrier in animal models,
so that plasma bioavailability following cromolyn inhalation will translate to concentrations in
the brain sufficient to interfere with beta-amyloid oligomerization and accumulation. Inhalation
of cromolyn sodium was shown to be the most effective non-injected administration route for
systemic bioavailability of cromolyn sodium in animals and humans (Moss, 1970; Neale, 1986;
Richards, 1987; Aswania, 1999; Tronde,2003). An FDA-approved route of administration for
cromolyn sodium is oral inhalation using a capsule-based dry powder inhaler, with 20 mg
cromolyn sodium loaded per capsule. Studies have shown that with high inspiratory rates, the
inhaled cromolyn sodium is delivered efficiently to the human lung, with 10-15% of the inhaled
drug-delivered-dose absorbed into the bloodstream (Richards, 1987; Keller, 2011). For these
reasons, cromolyn sodium inhalation with a dry powder inhaler device was selected as the route
of administration in this study. However, plasma levels of cromolyn following inhalation are
reported to show high intra- and inter-subject variability, and that cromolyn uptake by asthmatics
was lower than in healthy volunteers (Richards, 1987; Keller, 2011).
[00207]     Cromolyn sodium powder blend (ALZT-OPla) will be loaded into blisters for use
with a dry powder inhaler with reproducible aerosol performance at a range of inspiratory rates.
Each blister will contain the active product ingredient (cromolyn sodium) and inhalation grade
lactose monohydrate as an excipient. The once-daily cromolyn dose to be tested in this study is
less than 20% the dose from the four-times daily approved dose level (80 mg cromolyn sodium
total per day) for the treatment of asthma. The dose is calculated to titrate the estimated daily
22-27 nanogram of AP amyloid plaque produced in the brain.

      WO 2014/066318                                                         PCT/US2013/066069
[00208]     Taken together, the once daily ALZT-OPla dose in this study should preserve the
drug's excellent safety and tolerability profile, yet is predicted to achieve the nanomolar drug
concentrations needed to block beta-amyloid oligomerization in the brain to prevent Alzheimer's
disease progression.
[00209]     ALZT-OPlb (ibuprofen).       The generic name is iso-butyl-propanoic-phenolic acid.
ALZT-OPlb is an over the counter drug, taken in orally and does not require prescription.
Ibuprofen has a long safety history.       The drug is used for pain, fever, sports injuries   and
gastrointestinal problems.    The weight dosage independence has been indicated on the drug
package.
[00210]     The investigational product ALZT-OPlb (ibuprofen) is non-selective COX inhibitor
for treating inflammation as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The COX
enzymes convert certain fatty acids to prostaglandins. The prostaglandins at the end of the
"chain" of reactions that starts with the COX enzyme cause an increased sensitivity to pain, fever,
and vasodilation (increased blood flow or inflammation). By inhibiting the start of this chain of
reactions, ibuprofen therefore reduces pain, fever, and inflammation. Because ibuprofen blocks
the activity of both COX enzymes, it is considered a non-selective COX inhibitor NSAID.
[00211]     As described above, dampening the neuro-inflammatory response will impact AD
progression by several mechanisms.       Ibuprofen, which crosses the human blood brain barrier
(Bannworth, 1995; Parepally, 2006), dampens the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
(Gasparini, 2004), which should contribute to its utility for preventing AD progression.
However, NSAIDs, such as rofecoxib and naproxen, for the treatment of AD has been
inconclusive or contributed to higher risk of AD progression when administered as the sole
therapy in clinical trials (Thal, 2005; Imbimbo, 2010) despite the multiple epidemiology studies
showing reduced AD risk in individuals taking NSAIDs, including ibuprofen (Veld, 2001;
Etminan, 2003). Besides the criticism surrounding the choice of rofecoxib and naproxen as the
NSAIDs for sole therapy in AD (Gasparini, 2004), the ADAPT rofecoxib/naproxen treatment
trial was conducted with subjects exhibiting mild-to-moderate AD (Aisen 2003; Breitner, 2011).
Given the epidemiology data, it has been hypothesized that NSAID administration may be
beneficial only very early indisease (Imbimbo, 2010; Breitner, 2011). The aMCI patient
population is therefore the group that we have selected to be tested in this clinical study.
                                                 44

      WO 2014/066318                                                        PCT/US2013/066069
[00212]      It is important to note that in the NSAID epidemiology studies, AD risk decrease was
restricted to NSAIDs that presumably lower beta-amyloid (42-)peptide levels, such as ibuprofen
and indomethacin (Gasparini, 2004; Imbimbo, 2010), and long-term dosing with low NSAID
doses were equally effective as higher doses (Broe, 2000; Breitner 2001). Hence, in one cohort
in this AZTherapies ALZT-OP1 trial, oral ibuprofen will be administered as tablets (ALZT
OPIb) at a dose lower (less than 5%) of the lowest over-the-counter approved dose.               In
combination with cromolyn sodium inhalation treatment (ALZT-OPla), we will test the
hypothesis that dampening the low level neuroinflammatory response with ibuprofen will
contribute significantly to preventing cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's disease progression.
The dose is calculated to titrate the estimated invisible inflammatory response at the early stages
of the disease.
[00213]      Uncontrolled ibuprofen dosage is associated with several side effects such as nausea,
headache, ulcers, dizziness, and hypertension. A minor number of cases can cause heart or renal
failures. The overdose of ibuprofen can be dangerous. The proposed daily dose for this clinical
trial is 20 fold lower than the dose over the counter, and the total yearly dose totaled from the
chronic daily dose is less than a total weekly dose over the counter. It is not expected that the
yearly toxicity will exceed the weekly over the counter dose.
[00214]      Risk benefits of ALZT-OP1 (cromolyn)
[00215]      The main goal for using ALZT-OP1 in aMCI subject is its predicted multifunctional
treatment of the early appearance signs of cognitive impairment associated with Alzheime's
Disease. Low dose of ALZT-OPla is expected to control AP oligomerization and slow down the
extra cellular AP fibril brain accumulation.       At the same time, low dose of ALZT-OPla can
inhibit cytokine production from the high brain must cell concentration. The low dose ALZT
OPIb (ibuprofen), a known non-specific COX inhibitor, is expected to control the inflammatory
response associated with AP plaque formation. The main benefits of the low dose chronic daily
use are to control and slow down the earlier AD pathophysiology cascade of the main events that
trigger intracellular tau tangles and neuron degeneration. ALZT-OP1 treatment will slow down
later AD stages manifestation, prolong the patient's life, better control the quality of life and
significantly lower the expensive cost of family and nursing treatment and human resources.

[00216]     Both medications are approved for treatment since the seventies.            Both drugs
displayed excellent safety profile at much higher dosages. However, each of the drugs have its
own short and chronic treatment side effects for the used dosages.
[00217]     AZLT-OPla has a long history of safety in adults and children. Cromolyn sodium is
available as metered-dose inhalers, and used for long-term asthma prevention ad control by
decreasing inflammation and improving lung function.         Cromolyn blocks cytokine release of
mast cells that cause airways inflammation. The drug is associated with very mild side effects,
like coughing, skin rash, and headaches. The treatment doses in this clinical trial are 4-8 folds
lower that prescribed and are not expected to cause any significant higher toxicity that the
asthma dose.
