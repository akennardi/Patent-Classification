                                     TITLE OF INVENTION
     OTIC COMPOSITIONS USEFUL FOR THE TREATMENT OF INFECTIONS OF THE
                        INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EAR IN MAMMALS
[0001]     The present application is a divisional application from Australian patent application
number <removed-apn>, which in turn is a divisional application from Australian patent
application number 2010218108, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
reference.
                                         BACKGROUND
[0001a]    Otitis extema (external ear infection) is an inflammation of the outer ear and ear
canal. It is a common cause of earache in humans and a common problem in dogs, cats and
other mammals. It also occurs in many other species. This disorder involves inflammation of
the skin of the ear canal. The inflammation can be caused by active fungal, viral or bacterial
organisms. The ear canal skin often swells and may become painful and tender to touch.
[0002]     Otitis media (middle ear infection) occurs in the area between the ear drum and the
inner ear, including the Eustachian tube. Otitis media is very common in childhood, with the
average toddler experiencing two to three episodes a year, almost always accompanied by a
viral upper respiratory infection (URI), mostly the common cold. The rhinoviruses and
adenoviruses that cause many common cold symptoms cause swelling and congestion in the
inner ear which can permanently damage middle ear structures. Otitis media is also frequently
caused by a variety of bacteria and other viruses.
[0003]     Furthermore, ear infection (particularly in children) is one of the many diseases that
have become hard to treat with traditional antibiotic drugs because of antibiotic resistant
bacteria and antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Most cases of otitis media, for example, are
caused by one of several major pathogens, Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza,
Moraxella catarrhalia, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. There is thus an urgent need to develop new, non-antibiotic approaches to prevent
and manage these diseases.

        BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0004]     The invention includes a method of treating a mammal having an otic infection, the
method comprising contacting the ear of the mammal with a composition comprising
povidone iodine (PVP-I) at a concentration of 0.01%-5.0% and a steroid at a concentration of
0.01%-2.0%.
[0005]     In an aspect, the otic condition is at least one member selected from the group
consisting of bacterial otitis externa, malignant otitis, fungal otitis externa, otomycosis, otitis
media, and otitis interna. In an aspect, the PVP-I is present at a concentration of 1.0%-3.0%. In
another aspect, the PVP-I is present at a concentration of 2.0%.
[0006]     In an aspect, the steroid is selected from the group consisting of a dexamethasone, a
fluromethalone, a lotoprendol, a medrysone, a prednisolone, a difluprednate, a rimexolone,
and a hydrocortisone. In another aspect, the steroid is dexamethasone or a salt thereof. In an
aspect, the steroid is present at a concentration of 0.05%-0.1 %. In another aspect, the steroid
is present at a concentration of 0.1 %.
[0007]     In an aspect, the composition is contacted to the ear in the form of an ear drop, a
zinc acetate composition, or an acetic acid composition.
[0007a]    The invention further includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising: a.
povidone iodine (PVP-I) at a concentration of 0.01 %-5.0%; and b. a steroid at a concentration
of 0.01%-2.0%, wherein the steroid is selected from the group consisting of a
fluoromethalone, a lotoprednol, a medrysone, a prednisolone, a difluprednate, and a
rimexolone.
        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0008]     For the treatment of otic infections, there are currently no effective antifungals, no
effective antivirals and only one antibacterial available combined in the same dose form with
anti-inflammatories. It is well known that more dilute concentrations of PVP-I exhibit a more
potent antimicrobial effect in vitro, however previous attempts to produce a clinically effective
                                                   2

dilute PVP-I otic solution have been so far unsuccessful. It is further noted that the
formulation of PVP-I with other active ingredients can be complicated by reactivity of iodine
species with other labile chemical moieties. Such reactive species are common on many
steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.

    WO 2010/099212                                                          PCT/US2010/025251
  Definitions
   [00091    As used herein, "ear" refers to the biological structures responsible for hearing
  and equilibrium in vertebrates, among other things. "Ear" also include the visible
  portions of the biological structures, such as those often present on mammals.
  [0010]    The term "otic" refers to the ear, in general.
  [0011]    The term "treating", as used herein, refers to a detectable improvement in an
  adverse condition and/or a lessening the symptoms of the condition upon contacting a
  mammal with an oral composition of the invention and/or according to a method of the
  invention. The term "treating" encompasses both a partial improvement in an adverse
 condition and a complete eradication (i.e., "cure") of the condition. In an aspect, an
 infection is treated. In another aspect, inflammation is treated. In another aspect,
 infection and inflammation are both treated.
 Treatment of Otic Infections
 [00121     Cleaning in and around the ear canal, as well as treating otic infections, can
 sometimes be complicated by a buildup of cerumen, dead skin and other organic matter
 in and around the ear canal. Iodine is known to react with such substances, as iodine is
 chemically reactive, and active as a reducing agent. It is known, for example, that such
 substances in and around the ear canal can deplete the concentration of iodine in a 10%
iodine solution that is used for such cleaning purposes, thereby depleting the cleaning and
antimicrobial effectiveness of the iodine solution.
 [0013]    As disclosed herein, it has been surprisingly found that compositions
comprising povidone-iodine and a steroid are advantageously effective as antimicrobial
agents for otic indications. Additionally, it has been found that the inventive
compositions are effective at lower concentrations of iodine than shown and/or used in
the prior art.
[0014]     It has now been determined that the compositions and formulations disclosed
herein are surprisingly tolerable in the human ear. It is also disclosed herein that
                                                3

   WO 2010/099212                                                              PCT/US2010/025251
  formulations of the invention have in vitro activity against many common bacterial, viral
  and fungal pathogens. In an aspect, the invention encompasses treatment of a
  mammalian ear. In an aspect, the mammal is a human.
  [0015]    In an embodiment, a condition treatable with a composition of the invention
  includes, but is not limited to, bacterial otitis externa, malignant otitis, fungal otitis
 externa, otomycosis, otitis media, and otitis internal.
 Antimicrobials - Povidone Iodine
  [00161    In one embodiment, it is desirable to treat otic disorders as disclosed herein
 with both anti-inflammatories and antimicrobials suitable for the casuative organisms.
 Povidone iodine is an antimicrobial useful in the present invention.
 [0017] Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is a water-soluble complex of iodine with
 polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), with from 9.0% to 12.0% available iodine, calculated on a
 dry basis. PVP-I can be further formulated into topical antiseptic products as a solution
 (with surfactants and/or alcohol), aerosol or ointment at concentrations from 7.5% to
 10%. These products are sold over-the-counter (OTC) and used in hospitals for cleansing
 and disinfecting the skin, preparing the skin preoperatively and treating infections
 susceptible to iodine. It is believed that the membrane proteins in the cell architecture are
oxidized and subsequently denatured by free iodine generated from PVP-I solutions. This
then leads to the disruption of cellular boundaries and the free passage of iodine into the
cell.
[00181     Concentrations of PVP-I up to 10.0% (w/w, aqueous) are known to be safe for
use in the external ear and similarly safe if exposed to the inner ear through a ruptured
tympanic membrane.
PVP-I + Steroid Compositions
[0019]     In one embodiment, a stable, tolerable formulation of PVP-I with steroids has
been developed, as set forth in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0219170,
                                                 4

   WO 2010/099212                                                            PCT/US2010/025251
  incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. PVP-I and steroids are prepared in
  aqueous solution with common pharmaceutical excipients that is surprisingly stable at
  room temperature and elevated temperature in glass bottles and high-density
  polyurethane (HDPE) plastic bottles.
  [00201     The affinity of free iodine for reaction with -- OH, -- SH and --NH functional
  groups is well described in the literature and forms the basis for the anti-microbial
  activity of iodine-containing solutions (Rackur H. J. Hosp. Infect., 1985; 6: 13-23, and
  references therein). Dexamethasone (9-Fluoro-11 a, 17, 21 -trihydroxy- 16a
 methylpregna-1, 4-diene-3, 20-dione) contains three such moieties (--OH) at the 11, 17
 and 21 positions and two double bonds. One of skill in the art will understand that these
 hydroxyl groups would be prone to covalent substitution reactions by the free iodine
 generated in the solution equilibrium reaction described above for PVP-I, and the double
 bonds would be prone to electrophilic iodination reactions.
 [00211      Non-limiting examples of suitable steroids include: Dexamethasone alcohol,
 dexamethasone sodium phosphate, fluromethalone acetate, fluromethalone alcohol,
 lotoprendol etabonate, medrysone, prednisolone acetate, prednisolone sodium phosphate,
 difluprednate, rimexolone, hydrocortisone, and hydrocortisone acetate A steroid is used
 at a concentration of 0.01 %-2.0%, and in another embodiment, 0.05%-1.0% by weight of
 the final composition. In an aspect, the steroid concentration is 0.01%, 0.02%, 0.03%,
 0.04%, 0.05%, 0.06%, 0.07%, 0.08%, 0.09%, 0.1%, 0.11%, 0.12%, 0.13%, 0.14%,
 0.15%, 0.16%, 0.17%, 0.18%, 0.19%, 0.20%, 0.21%, 0.22%, 0.23%, 0.24%, 0.25%,
0.26%, 0.27%, 0.28%, 0.29%, 0.3%, 0.31%, 0.32%, 0.33%, 0.34%, 0.35%, 0.36%,
0.37%, 0.38%, 0.39%, 0.40%, 0.41%, 0.42%, 0.43%, 0.44%, 0.45%, 0.46%, 0.47%,
0.48%, 0.49%, or 0.5%.
[0022]      In an embodiment, as set forth in U.S. Patent Application No. 11/636,293,
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety as U.S. Patent Application Publication No.
2007/0219170, various solutions of PVP-I and dexamethasone remain stable for many
months, when prepared according to the compositions disclosed therein. Based on the
                                                5

     WO 2010/099212                                                         PCT/US2010/025251
    stability data disclosed, such compositions may be stable for years. The reaction of
    dexamethasone and PVP-I does not proceed to any appreciable extent at room
   temperature, in light or dark, or over time. After 8 weeks, the available iodine in the
   combination (0.3% PVP-I starting concentration) decreased by 20%.
    100231     Previously, for a dexamethasone/PVP-I composition, the available iodine of a
   0.625% PVP-I solution was determined to be 91% at 250 C and 98% at 4' C after 5 weeks
   storage, respectively. (Iryo Yakugaku 2003, 29(1), 62-65). Dexamethasone/PVP-I
   compositions set forth herein showed demonstrated a stabilized dilute PVP-I solution.
   After 8 weeks at room temperature, the available iodine in solutions with 0.5% and 1%
   PVP-I were over 99%.
   [00241     The invention therefore includes compositions comprising PVP-I in a range
  from 0.01% to 10% (weight/weight or weight/volume) in suitable drug delivery vehicles
  with or without a steroid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. In an embodiment,
  PVP-I is in the range of 1.0-5.0%, including any specific concentration within that range.
  In another embodiment, PVP-I is in the range from 1.5-4.0%, and in another
  embodiment, from 2.0-3.0%. In an embodiment, the PVP-I concentration is 0.1%, 0.2%,
 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.2%, 1.3%, 1.4%, 1.5%, 1.6%,
  1.7%, 1.8%, 1.9%, 2.0%, 2.1%, 2.2%, 2.3%, 2.4%, 2.5%, 2.6%, 2.7%, 2.8%, 2.9%, 3.0%,
 3.1%, 3.2%, 3.3%, 3.4%, 3.5%, 3.6%, 3.7%, 3.8%, 3.9%, 4.0%, 4.1%, 4.2%, 4.3%, 4.4%,
 4.5%, 4.6%, 4.7%, 4.8%, 4.9%, 5.0%, 5.1%, 5.2%, 5.3%, 5.4%, 5.5%, 5.6%, 5.7%, 5.8%,
 5.9%, 6.0%, 6.1%, 6.2%, 6.3%, 6.4%, 6.5%, 6.6%, 6.7%, 6.8%, 6.9%, 7.0%, 7.1%, 7.2%,
 7.3%, 7.4%, 7.5%, 7.6%, 7.7%, 7.8%, 7.9%, 8.0%, 8.1%, 8.2%, 8.3%, 8.4%, 8.5%, 8.6%,
 8.7%, 8.8%, 8.9%, 9.0%, 9.1%, 9.2%, 9.3%, 9.4%, 9.5%, 9.6%, 9.7%, 9.8%, 9.9%, or
 10.0%. In an embodiment, a steroid is used at a pharmaceutically-acceptable
 concentration.
 [00251      The compositions are useful in the treatment of active infections from bacterial,
mycobacterial, viral, fungal, or amoeba causes, as well as treatment to prevent such
infections in appropriate clinical settings. In an embodiment, the invention provides a
                                                6

   WO 2010/099212                                                          PCT/US2010/025251
  PVP-I + steroid composition that is non-reactive and stable, i.e., the PVP-I and the
  steroid are compatible. In an aspect, the steroid is dexamethasone.
  PVP-I + Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Compounds
  100261     It was also shown that PVP-I reacted with Ketorolac (a non-steroidal anti
  inflammatory) rapidly and that the Ketorolac was completely consumed and the available
  iodine in the PVP-I complex was reduced significantly depending on the ratio between
  Ketorolac and PVP-I. The combination of PVP-I and dexamethasone sodium phosphate
  also proved to be less stable, but not overly reactive (some dissociation of PVP-I complex
 to an unknown polymeric complex was observed in the UV spectra and the iodine
 concentration was reduced approximately 5% after 12 weeks. It was further observed that
 PVP-I reacts immediately with proparacaine and releases free iodine rapidly.
  [00271    Suitable anti-inflammatories for use in conjunction with compositions and
 methods herein include, but are not limited to, ketotifen fumarate, diclofenac sodium,
 nepafenac, bromfenac, flurbiprofen sodium, suprofen, celecoxib, naproxen, rofecoxib, or
 lodoxamide tromethamine.
 Pharmaceutical Compositions and Formulations
 [00281     In another aspect, the invention provides topical pharmaceutical compositions
 for use in treating and relieving the symptoms of ear, including, but not limited to, otitis
interna, otitis media and otitis extema (both acute and chronic). In an embodiment, the
compositions comprise PVP-I in an amount effective to reduce the growth of infection
causing microbes and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. In an embodiment,
PVP-I is present in an otic composition in the range of 0.1%-10%. In an embodiment,
the otic compositions may additionally comprise a steroid, such as, but are not limited to,
dexamethasone.
[0029]     In compositions for topical administration, the mixtures are preferably
formulated as aqueous solutions at a pH of 3.5 to 6.5. Preferably, the pH is adjusted to
                                               7

  WO 2010/099212                                                            PCT/US2010/025251
 between 4 and 5. This pH range may be achieved by the inclusion of suitable acids/bases
 in the composition.
 [00301    In an aspect, a composition may comprise one or more of an excipient, an
 antimicrobial agent, a preservative, a cosolvent, a surfactant, a viscosity agent, and/or a
bioadhesive agent, as set forth in detail elsewhere herein.
 [00311    In an aspect, a pharmaceutical preparation is a partially-alcoholic preparation.
As will be understood by the skilled artisan, inclusion of a percentage of alcohol in the
preparation will aid in the solubility of the components, including the steroid and the
PVP-I. The alcohol component will also serve as a dehydrating component for the
surface to which the preparation is applied. Alcohols useful in the invention include
methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol, among others.
         Lubricants
[00321     In an embodiment, a composition may comprise one or more lubricants
including, but are not limited to, propylene glycol, glycerin, polyethylene glycol, dextran,
blended polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, light mineral oil,
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hypromellose, carbopol, carbomer 940 (polyacrylic
acid), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, white petrolatum, soy lecithin, and sodium carboxyl
methylcellulose, as well as other agents known to those skilled in the art, or any
combination thereof. Typically, such lubricants are employed at a level of from 0.1% to
2% by weight. In an embodiment, the lubricants are 1.0% Propylene glycol, 0.3%
glycerin, 2.7% blended polyvinyl alcohols, 1% polyvinyl alcohol, 1% polyethylene
glycol, light mineral oil, 0.3% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, 1.0% soy lecithin, 0.25%
or 0.5% sodium carboxyl methylcellulose. In another embodiment, the total weight of a
PVP-I, artificial-tear based lubricant is between 0.1% and 4.5%.

 fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and
 the like); Aminoglycosides (tobramycin, gentamicin, neomycin, and the like); Polymyxin
 B Combinations (polymyxin B/trimethoprim, Polysporin polymyxin B/bacitracin
 Neosporin polymyxin B/neomycin/ gramicidin, and the like) and other antibiotics
 (azithromycin, ilotycin, erythromycin, bacitracin, and the like).
         Topical Anesthetics
 [00341     Suitable topical anesthetics for the compositions and methods of the invention
 include, but are not limited to, lidocaine, tetracaine or a derivative or combination
 thereof.

[00361     Preservative agents include benzalkonium chloride, thimerosal, chlorobutanol,
methyl paraben, propyl paraben, phenylethyl alcohol, EDTA, sorbic acid, Onamer M,
other agents known to those skilled in the art, or a combination thereof. Typically such
preservatives are employed at a level of from 0.001% to 1.0% by weight of final
composition.

          Co-Solvents
   [00371    The compositions of the invention may contain one or more optional co
  solvents. The solubility of the components of the present compositions may be enhanced
  by a surfactant or other appropriate co-solvent in the composition. Such
  cosolvents/surfactants include polysorbate 20, 60, and 80,
  polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene surfactants (e.g. Pluronic F-68, F-84 and P-103),
  cyclodextrin, tyloxapol, other agents known to those skilled in the art, or a combination
  thereof. Typically such co-solvents are employed at a level of from 0.01% to 2% by
  weight of the final composition.
          Soothing Agents
  [0038]    Furthermore, the compositions may comprise an effective amount of a chemical
 agent to provide a cooling sensation to relieve mild otic irritation, enhance comfort,
 provide a refreshing effect, and improved sensation, when the PVP-I solution is applied
 to the ear. Such an agent encompasses various chemicals and chemical classes,
 including, but are not limited to, cooling agents such as menthol, menthol derivatives
 including methone glycerin acetyl and menthyl esters, carboxamides, menthane glycerol
 ketals, alkyl substituted ureas, sulfonamides, terpene analogs, furanones, and phosphine
 oxides; or camphor, and borneol.
          Viscosity Agents
 [00391     The compositions of the invention may contain an optional viscosity agent
that is, an agent that can increase viscosity. Viscosity increased above that of simple
aqueous solutions may be desirable to increase otic absorption of the active compound, to
decrease variability in dispensing the formulation, to decrease physical separation of
components of a suspension or emulsion of the formulation and/or to otherwise improve
the otic formulation. Such viscosity builder agents include as examples polyvinyl alcohol,
polyvinylpyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,

  hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, other agents
  known to those skilled in the art, or a combination thereof. Such agents are typically
  employed at a level of from 0.01% to 2% by weight of the final composition.
          Bioadhesive Agents
  [00401     Bioadhesive agents can be used in the compositions to increase the retention

         Formulations and Evaluation of Effectiveness
 100411     In an embodiment, methods and compositions of the invention can reduce the
 progression of infectious otitis externa such that no additional progression is detected.
 Any method can be used to determine whether or not the severity of a symptom or the
progression rate of otitis externa is reduced. For example, a human having otitis externa
 can be questioned regarding pain or discomfort before and after treatment to determine
whether a symptom of otitis externa (e.g., ear pain or ear itching) is reduced. In some
cases, a mammal can be observed or tested for the severity of a symptom of otitis externa
(e.g., ear discharge, sensitivity of the ear to pressure, sensitivity of the earlobe to touch,
or reduced hearing) before and after treatment with an anti-infective compound (e.g.,
PVP-I) and a steroid to determine whether or not the severity of a symptom is reduced. In
some cases, an otolaryngologist can assess the severity of otitis externa (e.g., by
performing a physical examination and assigning a Grade 1 to 4 score, the characteristics
of which are known in the art) before and after treatment to determine whether the
severity of a symptom is reduced. To determine whether or not progression of otitis
externa is reduced, a physical examination can be performed at different time points to
                                                11

   WO 2010/099212                                                         PCT/US2010/025251
  determine the amount of erythema and/or edema in and around the ear canal. The amount
  of erythema and edema observed at different time points can be compared to assess the
 progression rate. After treatment as described herein, the progression rate can be
 determined again over another time interval to determine whether or not the progression
 rate has decreased.
  [00421   Therefore, it will be understood that an effective amount of a composition
 comprising PVP-I and a steroid is any amount that reduces the severity of a symptom or
 the progression of otitis externa without producing significant toxicity to the mammal.
 For example, an effective amount of PVP-I can be from about 0.1% to about 10% (e.g.,
 about 2%) povidone- iodine in an otic drop formulation. In an embodiment, an effective
 amount of a steroid such as dexamethasone can be from about 0.05% to about 1.0% (e.g.,
 about 0.1%) dexamethasone in an otic drop formulation. In an embodiment, an effective
 amount of a composition comprising PVP-I and dexamethasone can be from about 2
 drops to about 8 drops of an otic drop formulation containing about 2% povidone-iodine
 and about 0.10% dexamethasone applied to the ear.
 [00431    In an aspect, an otic composition is a zinc acetate composition. In another
aspect, an otic composition is an acetic acid composition.
 [00441    If a mammal does not appear respond to a particular amount of a composition
of the invention, then the amount of one or more of the PVP-I and the dexamethasone, for
example, can be increased. After receiving this higher concentration, the mammal can be
monitored for both responsiveness to the treatment and toxicity symptoms, and
adjustments made accordingly. The effective amount can remain constant or can be
adjusted as a sliding scale or variable dose depending on the mammal's response to
treatment. Various factors can influence the actual effective amount used for a particular
application. For example, the frequency of administration, duration of treatment, use of
multiple treatment agents, route of administration, immunocompetency of the mammal,
and severity of the otitis externa may require an increase or decrease in the actual
effective amount administered. The frequency of administration can be any frequency
                                             12

  WO 2010/099212                                                          PCT/US2010/025251
 that reduces the severity of a symptom or progression rate of otitis externa without
producing significant toxicity to the mammal. For example, the frequency of
 administration can be from about once daily to about four times daily (e.g., about twice
daily). The frequency of administration can remain constant or can be variable during the
duration of treatment.
 [00451    In another aspect, a course of treatment with an anti-infective compound and a
steroid can include rest periods. For example, an anti-infective and a steroid can be
administered over a two week period followed by a two week rest period, and such a
regimen can be repeated multiple times. As with the effective amount, various factors can
influence the actual frequency of administration used for a particular application. For
example, the effective amount, duration of treatment, use of multiple treatment agents,
route of administration, immunocompetency of the mammal, and severity of the otitis
externa may require an increase or decrease in administration frequency. An effective
duration for administering a composition provided herein can be any duration that
reduces the severity of a symptom or the progression rate of otitis externa without
producing significant toxicity to the mammal. Thus, the effective duration can vary from
several days to several weeks, months, or years. In general, the effective duration for the
treatment of otitis externa can range in duration from several days to several weeks. In
some cases, an effective duration can be for as long as an individual mammal is alive.
Multiple factors can influence the actual effective duration used for a particular
treatment. For example, an effective duration can vary with the frequency of
administration, effective amount, use of multiple treatment agents, route of
administration, immunocompetency of the mammal, and severity of the otitis extema.
[00461    The above diagnosis and treatment considerations can be applied in a similar
manner to the treatment of otitis media and otitis internal.
