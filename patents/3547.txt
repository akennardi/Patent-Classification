   Background
   Rifaximin is a semi-synthetic, rifamycin antimicrobial drug with in vitro activity against
   Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria. It acts by inhibiting bacterial
20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis. Rifaximin is chemically termed as (2S, 16Z, 18E, 20S,
   21S, 22R, 23R, 24R, 25S, 26S, 27S, 28E)-5,6,21,23,25-pentahydroxy-27-methoxy
   2,4,11,16,20,22,24,26-octamethyl-2,7-(epoxypentadeca-[1,11,13]-trienimino)benzofuro

10 Rifaximin was first disclosed in US 4,341,785 which also discloses a process for its
   preparation and a method for crystallization of rifaximin by using suitable solvents or a
   mixture of solvents. This patent does not mention polymorphism of rifaximin.

   W02008035109 discloses the amorphous form of rifaximin.
   9858225_1 (GHMattes) P87152.AU.2

   US 7,045,620, discloses various crystalline polymorphic forms of rifaximin which are
   termed as rifaximin a, rifaximin                  P  and rifaximin y. These polymorphic forms are
   characterized using X-ray powder diffraction. According to US 7,045,620, the presence of
   water within the crystallization solvent plays an important role in crystal formation. Thus,
 5 rifaximin polymorphs undergo changes with a change in the moisture content, and
   interconversion of one form to another occurs with an increase or decrease in the water
   content.
   US 7,045,620 further discloses rifaximin a which has a water content between 2.0% and
10 3.0%, rifaximin                  P which has a water content between 5.0% and 6.0%, and rifaximin y
   which is poorly crystalline and has a water content between 1.0% and 2.0%.
   EP1698630 discloses further polymorphic forms of rifaximin termed as 6 and                   E. The
   stability of these forms also depends upon the water content.
15
   However, all these forms are hygroscopic and they have a tendency to interconvert from
   one to another. Thus, these forms are difficult to handle as well as store and they require
   controlled conditions, specifically, humidity and temperature during handling and storage.
20 Thus, transformations of polymorphic forms of drug substances are of great disadvantage,
   because they cause difficulties in fulfilling pharmaceutical requirements and specifications.
   The physicochemical properties of products that exhibit such polymorphic change vary
   according to the actual ratio of polymorphic forms. This causes further difficulties while
   formulating the polymorphic forms into suitable dosage forms.
25
   Also, as rifaximin is sparingly soluble in water, the formulation chemist finds it difficult to
   prepare a consistent formulation using the known polymorphic forms. Hence, there is a
   need to prepare rifaximin in a form which is suitable for formulation and has increased
   solubility and stability.

20 Detailed Description of the Invention
   The invention will now be described in detail in connection with certain preferred and
   optional embodiments, so that various aspects thereof may be more fully understood and
   appreciated.
25
   The present invention provides a form of rifaximin with enhanced solubility and stability.
   This form of rifaximin comprises a complex of rifaximin with a complexing agent. The
   complexing agents used in the present invention include more particularly a polyvinyl
   pyrrolidone or a cyclodextrin.
30
   9858225_1 (GHMatters) P87152.AU.2

                                                  10
   There is also provided by the present invention a process for preparing the rifaximin
   complexing agent complex of the present invention, the process comprising:
   a) dissolving the rifaximin in a suitable solvent;
 5 b) adding the complexing agent to the rifaximin solution either as such or in the form of
   solution to form a mixture;
   c) isolating the complex, for example by concentrating the reaction mass obtained in step
   b) and further drying to obtain the complex.
10 The rifaximin used in the process of the present invention may be obtained by any one of
   the methods disclosed in the prior art. For example, the rifaximin used in the process of
   the present invention may be in the polymorphic form a, P, y, 5 or      E.  In a preferred
   embodiment of the present invention, the rifaximin used is in the p-form. The p-form of
   rifaximin is the least soluble known form of rifaximin.
15
   The solvent used may be selected from ethers, alcohols, esters, aldehydes, halogenated
   solvents, hydrocarbons and combinations thereof.
   In the process of the present invention, the complexing agent used may be selected from
20 polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) or cyclodextrin (CD).
   Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, also known as "povidone") is commercially available as a white
   powder of a given molecular weight. Generally, the molecular weights of PVP polymers
   are given by their K-values, e.g., K-15 to K-90. The K-value indicates the average
25 molecular weight ranging from 20,000 to 1,000,000. A preferred PVP is K-30, typically
   having a molecular weight of about 40,000. An unusual property of PVP is its solubility in
   water as well as in various organic solvents.
   In the process of the present invention, the PVP may be selected from the group
30 consisting of PVP K-12, K-15, K-17, K-25, K-30, K-60, K-80, K-90 and K-120. Preferably,
   K-25, K-30, K-90, and most preferably K-30.
   9858225_1 (GHMattes) P87152.AU.2

                                                  11
   In the process of the present invention, the cyclodextrin used to form the complex may be
   in any form of cyclodextrin, including a-cyclodextrin having 6 glucose units, p-cyclodextrin
   having 7 glucose units, or y-cyclodextrin having 8 glucose units. The cyclodextrin may
   also be in anhydrous or hydrated form. The preferred cyclodextrin is p-cyclodextrin.
 5
   The complexing agent may be added as such or as a solution in a suitable solvent. The
   amount of rifaximin that can be encapsulated is directly related to the molecular weight of
   the rifaximin.
10 In some embodiments, one mole of complexing agent encapsulates one mole of rifaximin.
   Preferably, the amounts of rifaximin and complexing agent used in the formulation are
   typically sufficient to provide the desired therapeutic effect. On a weight basis, the ratio
   between rifaximin and complexing agent in the given composition (termed "w/w"), ranges
   from 20:1 to 1:20, preferably from 10:1 to 1:2.           Typically, the ratio of rifaximin to
15 complexing agent ranges from 4:1 to 1:2. The ratio may be 1:1.
   The solvent may be removed rapidly and completely by vacuum drying or vacuum
   evaporation. In an embodiment, the solvent may be removed by spray drying to yield the
   rifaximin complex. In another embodiment, the rifaximin complex may be obtained freeze
20 drying. In yet another embodiment, the rifaximin complex may be isolated by microwave
   treatment techniques.
   According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a rifaximin complex
   which enhances at least one of the following:
25
   a) stabilization of rifaximin against degradation (e.g. hydrolysis, oxidation, etc)
   b) enhancement of water solubility of rifaximin
   c) better dissolution
   d) free flowing and non-hygroscopic rifaximin
30 e) modified solubility, delivery or performance
   f) safe handling of rifaximin
   9858225_1 (GHMattes) P87152.AU.2

                                                  12
   The rifaximin complex of the present invention is not a simple physical mixture of the
   ingredients. This rifaximin complex is superior to the conventional free base of rifaximin,
   for example in terms of storage stability.
 5 Further, it was observed that the use of a complexing agent as an excipient in the
   formulation enhances solubility to some extent but the formation of a complex with
   rifaximin enhances solubility much more than mixing it physically as an excipient. Further,
   the aqueous solubility of the rifaximin complex with cyclodextrin or PVP is found to be
   greater than the aqueous solubility of rifaximin. The enhanced solubility of the complex
10 can further increase dissolution rate as shown in Figures 1 to 8 and thus makes these
   complexes more bio-available in the body. This increase in bioavailability and stability of
   the complex further allows for smaller doses to achieve the desired therapeutic effect
   compared to a larger dose of rifaximin            alone. Further, these complexes avoid
   interconversion of crystalline forms of rifaximin. In addition, these complexes can be used
15 to reduce or prevent gastrointestinal and ocular irritation, to reduce or eliminate unpleasant
   smells or tastes, as well as to prevent drug-drug or drug-additive interactions.
   According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a rifaximin complex
   characterized by having an intrinsic dissolution profile as shown in any one of Figures 1 to
20 8.
   To measure the intrinsic dissolution of a rifaximin complex, for example a rifaximin-PVP
   complex or a rifaximin-CD complex, rifaximin samples were measured to compare the
   influence of the different parameter settings. At appropriate time intervals, an automated
25 sample collector removes aliquots from the dissolution medium for analysis. The time
   interval for sampling can vary, for example, from 2 to 30 minutes, depending on the
   properties of the drug and dissolution medium used. Suitable dissolution equipment for
   these operations includes LAB INDIA DISSO 2000.
30 The complexes may be used in a variety of applications. In an embodiment, the
   composition of the present invention is in the form of a tablet, a capsule or a liquid oral.

                                                 13
   The composition may further optionally include additional components to enhance or
   achieve the desired therapeutic effect of rifaximin. Examples of such components include,
   but are not limited to surfactants, excipients, disintegrating agents, binders, lubricants,
   dispersing agents, thickening agents.

   When compared with a physical mixture of rifaximin with a complexing agent, the rifaximin
   complex exhibited a superior rate of dissolution as shown in Tables 9 and 10 below.
   The percentage of actual release of rifaximin is calculated from the characteristics data
10 obtained in the Figures 1 to 8. The formula for calculating the percentage of actual release
   of rifaximin from the complex is given below:
                                         % relese of rifaximin from the complex
