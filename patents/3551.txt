The specific functions of each module are as follows:
1. Power supply part: As shown in figure 3, the input end of the power supply is directly
connected to the accumulator inside the system, a three-end voltage stabilizer Ul 1M7805
is used for reducing a voltage to stabilize the voltage to be 5V so as to supply power for a
single chip microcomputer, and El, E2, C1 and C2 are filter capacitors.
Sampling signal part: When a current passes through the MOS transistor, due to the
internal resistance of the MOS transistor, voltage reduction of two ends of the MOS
transistor can be sampled, a sampling signal is sampled through a resister R4, Z2 is a 5V
voltage stabilizing transistor which can ensure that the sampling voltage does not exceed
                                               6

5V and passes through an operational amplifier 1, circuits R9 and R 11 are amplification
resisters of the amplifier, the amplified signal is connected to an R12 and is connected to
the positive end of an operational amplifier 2 through the R12 so as to be sampled, the
negative end of the operational amplifier 2 is a voltage reference, comparison is performed
through the reference, if the sampled signal is greater than the reference, an R17 outputs a
high level, and if the sampled signal is less than the reference, the R17 outputs a low level.
2. 24V accumulator protection module: When the clip is connected to the 24V accumulator,
the voltage is output to the positive end of the operational amplifier 2 through the voltage
stabilizing tube ZI and the diode D2 to enable the voltage to be quickly higher than the
reference voltage, and thus the R17 outputs a high level.
3. MOS transistor driving circuit: As shown in figure 3, during normal working, a single
chip microcomputer with a port P4 can output a high level to enable the MOS transistor QI
and the MOS transistor Q2 to be conducted, when the system is in short circuit, is reversely
connected with the external accumulator or is connected with the 24V external accumulator,
the R17 can quickly output a high level to enable the Q6 to be conducted, and then, the
grid voltage of the MOS transistor Q2 is quickly reduced to enable the Q2 to be closed and
disconnected, thereby protecting the system.
4. Temperature sampling circuit: As shown in figure 2, a thermistor Rtl samples the
temperature on the MOS transistor, then the temperature is transferred to the single chip
microcomputer, the single chip microcomputer judges whether the temperature exceeds a
set temperature or not, and when the temperature is too high, the single chip
microcomputer outputs a low level through the port P4 to enable the MOS transistor QI to
be switched off, thereby protecting the circuit.
5. Alarm and indication circuit: As shown in figure 3, the working state of the system is
indicated by two LED lamps and a buzzer driven by a triode, when the system works
normally, the LED2 is lightened, and when the system works abnormally, the LED 1 and
the buzzer give alarms simultaneously.
6. CMOS transistors are used as a switch of the emergency power supply due to the
capability that a high current can pass through the CMOS transistors. Two CMOS
                                                7

transistors are reversely connected in series to solve the problem that backward diodes
inside the CMOS transistors are damaged when the current reversely passes through the
backward diodes. As shown in figure 2, the source electrode of the Q2 and the drain
electrode of the QI are connected to form a switching action and are connected to the
negative electrode of the emergency power supply. The pressure reduction of the two
CMOS transistors can be conveniently measured so as to calculate the current passing
through the CMOS transistors. When the current exceeds the set current value, the single
chip microcomputer closes the output.
The intelligent emergency power supply protector of the present disclosure samples the
current passing through the MOS transistor through the internal resistance of the MOS
transistor to control the MOS transistor to be switched on or switched off so as to protect
the system during reverse connection, short circuit, over voltage and over temperature, so
that the system is safe and cannot be damaged under extreme conditions, and the system is
safer and more reliable in use. In the prior art, batteries are damaged and even a fire is
caused due to misoperation, reverse connection of the accumulator or short circuit of the
clip under the condition that the switch is switched on. The intelligent emergency power
supply protector of the present disclosure can well protect the emergency power supply,
and the batteries cannot be damaged due to improper use by users.

present disclosure, and all modifications or equivalent deformations made by those skilled
in the art on the basis of the essential contents of the present disclosure are all within the
