                                              Background
   [0002] X-ray mammography has long been a screening modality for breast cancer and
10 other lesions, and also has been relied on for diagnostic and other purposes. For
   mammograms, a cone-shaped or pyramid-shaped x-ray beam passes through the
   compressed breast and forms a two-dimensional projection image. Any one of a number
   of orientations can be used, such as cranial-caudal (CC) or mediolateral-oblique (MLO)
   orientation. Another imaging modality is breast x-ray tomosynthesis. The technology
15 typically involves taking two-dimensional (2D) projection images of the immobilized
   breast at each of a number of angles of the x-ray beam relative to the breast and processing
   the resulting x-ray measurements to reconstruct images of breast slices that typically are in
   planes transverse to the x-ray beam axis, such as parallel to the image plane of a
   mammogram of the same breast.

                                               Summary
   [0003] In one aspect, the technology relates to an apparatus having: an upright gantry; a
   tube arm assembly rotatably coupled to the upright gantry; a compression arm assembly
   rotatably coupled to the upright gantry, wherein the tube arm assembly is at least partially
25 independently rotatable relative to the compression arm assembly; and a controller
   disposed on the upright gantry and operably connected to at least one of the tube arm
   assembly and the compression arm assembly. In an example, the controller includes a first
   controller disposed on a first side of the upright gantry and a second controller disposed on
   a second side of the upright gantry. In another example, the controller includes two
30 controllers disposed on opposite sides of the gantry. In yet another example, the controller
   is at least partially flush with an outer housing of the gantry. In still another example, the
   controller includes a longitudinal axis substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis of the
   upright gantry.

   [0004] In another example of the above aspect, a first side of the controller projects a first
   distance from an outer housing of the gantry and wherein a second side of the controller
   projects a second distance from the outer housing of the gantry, wherein the first distance
   is less than the second distance. In an example, the controller includes at least one of a
 5 button, a dial, a knob, and a graphic user interface. In another example, a front face of the
   controller is disposed at an angle to an outer housing of the gantry. In yet another
   example, the controller includes a substantially D-shaped outline. In still another example,
   the controller is disposed a distance above a floor surface greater than one-half a total
   height of the gantry.
10 [0005] In another example of the above aspect, the controller includes a locating feature.
   In an example, the locating feature includes at least one of a recess, a raised feature, and a
   button. In another example, the controller faces away from a patient station.

                                        Detailed Description
   [0015] The present technology relates to a breast imaging systems that are used to
   generate mammograms and/or tomosynthesis images of the breast. In use, a technician
   places a breast of a patient on a platform of an imaging system and compresses the breast
 5 against the platform with a breast compression plate or paddle. One or more x-ray images
   are then taken of the breast and processed for analysis.
   [0016] FIGS. 1-4 illustrate a non-limiting example of a multi-mode
   mammography/tomosynthesis system comprising a floor-mounted, upright gantry 100 and
   a data acquisition work-station 102. Gantry 100 includes a housing 104 supporting a tube
10 arm assembly 106 rotatably mounted thereon to pivot about a horizontal axis 402 (FIG. 4)
   and carrying an x-ray tube assembly 108. X-ray tube assembly 108 includes (1) an x-ray
   tube generating x-ray energy in a selected range, such as 20-50 kV, at mAs such as in the
   range 3-400 mAs, with focal spots such as a nominal size 0.3 mm large spot and nominal
   size 0.1 mm small spot (2) supports for multiple filters such as molybdenum, rhodium,
15 aluminum, copper, and tin filters, and (3) an adjustable collimation assembly selectively
   collimating the x-ray beam from the focal spot in a range such as from 7x8 cm to 24x29
   when measured at the image plane of an x-ray image receptor included in the system, at a
   maximum source-image distance such as 75 cm. Also mounted on housing 104, for
   rotation about the same axis 402, is a compression arm assembly 110 that includes a
20 compression device 112 having to a compression plate or paddle 122 and a receptor
   housing 114 having an upper surface 116 serving as a breast plate and enclosing a receptor
   subsystem system 117 comprising a flat panel x-ray receptor 119, a retractable anti-scatter
   grid 121, and a mechanism (not shown) for driving and retracting anti-scatter grid 121.
   Housing 104 also encloses the following components: a vertical travel assembly 404 for
25 moving tube arm assembly 106 and compression arm assembly 110 up and down to
   accommodate a particular patient or imaging position, a tube arm assembly rotation
   mechanism 406 to rotate tube arm assembly 106 about axis 402 for different imaging
   positions, a receptor subsystem rotation mechanism 408 for rotating components of
   receptor subsystem 117 (such as x-ray receptor 119) about axis 402 to accommodate
30 different operation modes, and couple/uncouple mechanism 410 to selectively couple or
   uncouple tube arm assembly 106 and compression arm assembly 110 to and from each
   other, and tube arm assembly 106 and receptor subsystem 117 to and from each other.
   Housing 104 also encloses suitable motors and electrical and mechanical components and
   connections to implement the functions discussed here. A patient shield 125,
                                                  3

   schematically illustrated in FIG. 2, can be secured to compression arm assembly 110 to
   provide a mechanical interlock against patient contact with the rotating x-ray tube arm
   assembly 106. A spacer 1002 (FIG. 4) may be used for different degrees of magnification.
   [0017] Work-station 102 comprises components similar to those in the Selenia®
 5 Dimensions@ mammography system, including a display screen (typically a flat panel
   display that may include touch-screen functionality), user interface devices such as a
   keyboard, possibly a touch-screen, and a mouse or trackball, and various switches and
   indicator lights and/or displays. Work-station 102 also includes computer facilities similar
   to those of the Selenia® Dimensions@ system (but adapted through hardware, firmware
10 and software differences) for controlling gantry 100 and for processing, storing and
   displaying data received from gantry 100. A power generation facility for x-ray tube
   assembly 108 may be included in housing 104 or in work-station 102. A power source 118
   powers work-station 102. Gantry 100 and work-station 102 exchange data and controls
   over a schematically illustrated connection 120.
15 [0018] The gantry 100 may also include one or more controllers 130 that may be used for
   certain functions of the gantry 100. The controller 130 is disposed on the compression
   arm assembly 110 and may be used by a technician to raise or lower the compression arm
   assembly 110 (e.g., for patients of different heights), raise or lower the compression device
   112, rotate the tube arm assembly 106, or perform other functions. A controller 130a,
20 130b is located on either side of the compression arm assembly 110, so as to be more
   easily accessible by a technician. While locating the controller 130a, 130b on the
   compression arm assembly 110 may be convenient for the technician, rotation of the tube
   arm assembly 106 and/or compression arm assembly 110 may make access thereto
   difficult, as described below.
25 [0019] In standard mammography mode, typically used for screening mammography, tube
   arm assembly 106 and compression arm assembly 110 are coupled and locked together by
   410 in a relative position such as seen in FIG. 1, such that an x-ray beam from x-ray tube
   assembly 108 illuminates x-ray receptor 119 when the patient's breast is compressed by
   compression device 112. In this mode, the system operates in a manner similar to said
30 Selenia@ Dimensions@ system to take a mammogram. Vertical travel assembly 404 and
   tube arm rotation mechanism 406 can make vertical adjustments to accommodate a
   patient, and can rotate tube arm assembly 106 and compression arm assembly 110 together
   as a unit about axis 402 for different image orientations such as for CC and for MLO
   images. For example, tube arm assembly 106 and compression arm assembly 110 can
                                                  4

   rotate between -195' and +1500 about axis 402. FIG. 4 depicts rotation of the tube arm
   assembly 106, which may limit access to the controller 130b. As in the Selenia@
   Dimesions@ system, compression device 112 includes a compression paddle 122 that can
   move laterally, in a direction along the chest wall of a patient, to adjust for different
 5 imaging orientations. Typically, anti-scatter grid 121 is over x-ray receptor 119 in the
   standard mammography mode to reduce the effect of x-ray scatter.
   [0020] As noted above, both of the tube arm assembly 106 and the compression arm
   assembly 110 can rotate between -195'     and +150' about axis 402. FIG. 3 depicts rotation
   of the tube arm assembly 106. In the depicted position., the rotated position of the tube
10 arm assembly 106 may limit technician access to the controller 130b. Moreover, in
   circumstances where the compression arm assembly 110 is rotated, access may be further
   limited. For example, if the compression arm assembly 110 rotates counterclockwise from
   the position depicted in FIG. 3, the controller 130a will be extremely difficult to view, let
   alone activate, especially for technicians that are short of stature. As such, workflow may
15 be impeded if either controller 130a, 130b becomes obstructed or otherwise difficult to
   reach.
   [0021] FIG. 5 is an enlarged view of an imaging apparatus 200, with a tube arm assembly
   206 in a rotated position. The imaging apparatus 200 may include any or all of the
   components depicted and described with regard to FIGS. 1-4. As such, not all of those
20 components are necessarily depicted or described further in the following figures. A
   compression arm assembly 210 and patient shield 225 are also depicted. As in the
   previous figures, both the tube arm assembly 206 and compression arm assembly 210 may
   rotate relative to an upright housing 204 (in the form of a pillar having a rectangular,
   curved, or other shape) of a gantry 201. Rotation of the tube arm assembly 206 changes a
25 position of the x-ray tube assembly 208 and an enclosed receptor subsystem system 217.
   Rotation of the compression arm assembly 210 changes a position of a receptor housing
   214 and an upper surface 216 thereof, as well as a compression paddle 222. The imaging
   apparatus 200 of FIG. 5, however, incorporates a controller 230a on at least one side of the
   housing 204 of the upright gantry 201. A second controller may be disposed on an
30 opposite side of the gantry 201, but is not visible in FIG. 5. The positioning of the
   controller 230a in such a location allows a technician to easily access the controller 230a,
   regardless of the position of the tube arm assembly 206, position of the compression arm
   assembly 210, height or reach of the technician, etc. For example, the controller 230a may
   be easily accessed whether the tube arm assembly 206 and compression arm assembly 210
                                                  5

   are oriented for a CC or MLO orientation for an examination.
   [0022] The controller 230a may include one or more components required to perform
   various actions or procedures. Such actions may include but are not limited to, rotation of
   the tube arm assembly 206, rotation or elevation change of the compression arm assembly
 5 210, compression by the paddle 222 to the breast, and so on. Such components may
   include a graphic user (or touch-sensitive) interface 232, a button 234, a knob or dial 236,
   a fingerprint scanner 238 (to confirm authorized usage, e.g. or other type of biometric
   login), or other components. These components are supported in a controller housing 240
   that may at least partially protrude from the housing 204 of the gantry 201. In the example
10 of FIG. 5, the controller housing 240 is disposed proximate a slot 242 defined by the
   housing 204. The controller housing 240 may engage with a projection that extends from
   an interior of the gantry 201, through the slot 242, so as to be slidably moved along the
   slot 242. This may further increase the usability of the controller 230a, for technicians of
   different heights or reaches, for example. In other examples, however a vertical position
15 of the controller 230a may be fixed relative to the gantry 201. In examples where the
   vertical position of the controller 230a is fixed, it may be desirable that the controller is
   disposed at a height H above a floor that is greater than one-half of the total height of the
   gantry 201, since technicians of different heights may be able to easily access a controller
   230a so positioned.
20 [0023] Vertical sides of the controller housing 240 may be longer than top and bottom
   sides of the controller housing 240. As such, the controller housing 240 may define a
   longitudinal axis Lc that is substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis La of the gantry
   201. Such a longer, narrower controller housing 240 may allow the controller to have a
   lower profile extending away from the gantry housing 204. This may prevent the
25 controller 230a from being inadvertently bumped or contacted as a technician moves about
   the imaging apparatus 200. Other shapes are contemplated. For example, the controller
   230a is depicted as having a rectangular outline. Controllers having circular, oval, D
   shaped, or polygonal outlines are also contemplated. Such outlines may be utilized to
   match the aesthetics of the gantry 201.
30 [0024] FIGS. 6A and 6B depict partial top views of a controller 330a, 330b of an imaging
   apparatus 300a, 300b. In FIG. 6A, the controller 330a is pivotable P about one or more
   brackets 350 that extend from a housing 304a of a gantry 301a. This allows the controller
   330a to be more easily viewable by a technician working with a patient standing near the
   front F of the gantry 301a (e.g., a patient having a breast compressed for imaging).
                                                   6

   [0025] In FIG. 6B, a front face 352b of a controller 330b is disposed at an angle a relative
   to a housing 304b of a gantry 301b. A first side 354b has a first length measured from the
   housing 304b, while a second side 356b has a second length measured therefrom. The
   second length is greater than the first length. By disposing the front face 352b at an angle,
 5 visibility of the front face 352b, which contains the control components, is increased. This
   is particularly useful for a technician working with a patient standing near a front face F of
   the gantry 30 lb. In certain examples, the first length of the first side 356b may be short
   enough such that the first side 356b is substantially flush with the housing 304b.
   [0026] FIG. 7 depicts a top view of an imaging apparatus 400, including an upright gantry
10 401, a tube arm assembly 406, and a compression arm assembly 410. A patient P is
   located at a patient station (e.g., proximate the compression arm assembly 410 where a
   breast imaging procedure may be performed). An axis A extends through a collar 470 that
   extends from the gantry 401. Mechanisms within the collar 470 allow for rotation of both
   the tube arm assembly 406 and the compression arm assembly 410 about the axis A. Two
15 controllers 430a, 430b are disposed on either side of the gantry 401. The front face 452a,
   452b of each controller 430a, 430b face in a direction substantially away from the axis A.
   As such, the front faces 452a, 452b are generally out of view of the patient P. This may be
   advantageous, as flashings lights or other elements on the controllers 430a, 430b may
   cause the patient unnecessary anxiety if visible.
20 [0027] FIG. 8 depicts a front view of a controller 530, specifically a substantially D
   shaped controller. The front face 552 of the controller includes a display screen 532
   which may act as a graphic user interface or a simple display. The front face 552 also
   includes a plurality of buttons 534. Certain buttons 534a may have an outer contour
   shaped to match an outer perimeter or contour 580 of the controller 530. The controller
25 530 also includes features that allow a technician to orient herself during use of the
   controller 530, without necessarily seeing the front face 552 and the components disposed
   thereon. Under such circumstances, the controller 530 may be used without being visible
   to the user. For example, the outer perimeter or contour 580 may define one or more
   recesses or cutouts 582 that, when touched, give an indication to a technician of the
30 location of their hand relative to the front face 552. In the depicted example, contacting
   the recess 582 would indicate to the technician that her hand is disposed proximate the
   display screen 532. A raised feature 584, for example, disposed near or between buttons
   534 may also be used to orient a technician to the controller 530 when the controller 530 is
   not visible. In another example, the controller 530 may include buttons 534 that are
                                                   7

   raised, lowered, or flush with the front face 552, to increase usability thereof.
