   Field of the Invention
 5              The present invention generally relates to gaming machines and methods of
   gaming.
   Background of the Invention
                With the increase of gambling at gaming venues has come increased
10 competition between gaming venues to obtain a larger share of the total gambling
   spend. Gaming venue operators have therefore continuously looked for new variations
   and types of games in order to attract both new and return customers to their venues.
                In response to this need, suppliers of gaming devices and systems have
15 attempted to provide the sought after variety, while still developing games that comply
   with the relevant regulations in the jurisdiction of the gaming venue operator. Suppliers
   of gaming devices therefore are faced with restrictions on the types of games and
   gaming machines that are allowable, both in terms of the prevailing regulations and in
   terms of providing a return on investment to the gaming venue operators.
20
                Many jurisdictions specify a particular minimum return to player that a gaming
   machine must have. For example, a jurisdiction may specify a minimum average return
   to player of 85%. Gaming machines are therefore designed to exceed this minimum
   average required return to player, while still in the medium to long term provide an
25 adequate return on investment to the gaming venue operator. Providing a return to
   gaming venue operators requires that players lose money over time. However, the
   perception of excessive losses on a gaming machine can detract from the
   entertainment value of game play.

    Detailed Description
                 In Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings, one example of a gaming console
    that is suitable to implement the present invention is generally referenced by arrow
35  114.
    10410121_1 (GHMaers) P88025.AU.3

                                                      5
                The gaming console 114 includes two displays 106A, 106B on one or both of
   which is displayed representations of a game that can be played by a player and a
   bank of buttons 107A and/or a touch screen 107B to enable a player to play the game.
 5 The displays 106 may be video display units, such as a cathode ray tube screen
   device, a liquid crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video display unit, or
   the visible portion of an electromechanical device. The display 106B may display
   artwork, including for example, pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game. In alternative gaming consoles the display
10 106B may be omitted, optionally replaced by a static display.
                A credit input including a coin input 11 0A and/or bill collector 11 OB allows a
   player to provide credit for wagering and a coin output 111 is provided for cash payouts
   from the gaming console 114. A card and/or ticket reader 108 and a printer 109 may
15 be provided to provide player tracking, cashless game play or other gaming and non
   gaming related functions.
                Figure 2 shows a block diagram of a gaming machine, generally referenced by
   arrow 100, suitable for implementing the present invention. The gaming machine 100
20 may include the gaming console 114 shown in Figure 1 and accordingly like reference
   numerals have been used to describe like components in Figures 1 and 2.
                The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101, which in the
   illustrated example includes a computational device 102, which may be a
25 microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device or other suitable device.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the computational device 102 are stored in
   a memory 103, which is in data communication with, or forms part of, the
   computational device 102. Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both volatile
   and non-volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory, with such
30 memories being collectively represented by the memory 103. The instructions to cause
   the game controller 101 to implement the present invention will be stored in the
   memory 103.
                The game controller 101 may include hardware credit meters 104 for the
35 purposes of regulatory compliance and also include an input/output (1/O) interface 105
   10410121_1 (GHMaers) P88025.AU.3

                                                    6
    for communicating with the peripheral devices of the gaming machine 100. The
    input/output interface 105 and/or the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
    their own memory for instructions and data.
  5              In the example shown in Figure 2, the peripheral devices that communicate
    with the controller are the displays 106, bank of buttons/touch screen 107, the card
    and/or ticket reader 108, the printer 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input 110 and a
    coin output 111. Additional devices may be included as part of the gaming machine
    100, or devices omitted as required for the specific implementation.
10
                 The bank of buttons 107A and/or touch screen 107B together with one or both
    of the displays 106 may provide a user interface 115 through which the gaming
    machine 100 and player communicate. If a card/ticket reader 108 is provided, this may
    also form part of the user interface 115.
15
                 In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a communications interface,
    for example a network card 112. The network card 112, may for example, send status
    information, accounting information or other information to a central controller, server
    or database and receive data or commands from the central controller, server or
20  database. The network card 112 may also enable communication with a central player
    account, allowing cashless gaming. One or more of the peripheral devices, for example
    the card/ticket reader 108 may be able to communicate directly with the network card
    112. The network card 112 and the I/O interface 105 may be suitably implemented as
    a single machine communications interface.
25
                 The game controller 101 may also include a random number generator 113,
    which generates a series of random numbers that are used by the computational
    device 102 to determine the outcomes of games played on the gaming machine 100.
30               The game controller 101 may have distributed hardware and software
    components that communicate with each other directly or through a network or other
    communication channel. The game controller 101 may also be located in part or in its
    entirety remote from the user interface 115. Also, the computational device 102 may
    include a plurality of devices, which may be local or remote from each other.

                Figure 3 shows an exemplary block diagram of the main components of the
   memory 103. The RAM 103A typically temporarily holds instructions and data related
   to the execution of game programs and communication functions performed by the
   computational controller 102. The EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or
 5 may contain system and game related code. The mass storage device 103C may be
   used to store game programs, the integrity of which may be verified and/or
   authenticated by the computational controller 102 using protected code from the
   EPROM 103B or elsewhere.
10              Figure 4 shows a process flow diagram of a typical game process in which the
   present invention may be utilised. The process may be performed by the gaming
   machine 100 described herein and the following description assumes this
   implementation. However, those skilled in the relevant arts will appreciate that the
   process will also be able to be implemented by other gaming machines, devices or
15 systems. While the process is described with reference to a specific order of steps, in
   alternative embodiments the order of the steps may be changed, subject to compliance
   with the relevant regulations, if any that may apply.
                In step 1, the game controller 101 monitors the bill acceptor and/or coin input
20 110 and/or information received by the card/ticket reader 108 or network card 112 for a
   deposit of credit and in response causes the credit meters 104 to increment according
   to the denomination of the game. The game controller 101 then monitors the user
   interface 107 for the input of a wager.
25              Once the wager has been determined in step 1 and if there are sufficient credits
   in the meters 104 to support the wager (see herein below), in one embodiment the
   game controller 101 decrements the relevant credit meter 104 by the amount of the
   wager. In other embodiments, as is explained herein below the credit meter 104 is not
   decremented by any wager amount. In step 2 the gaming controller 101 receives one
30 or more random numbers from the RNG 113 and determines the game outcome based
   on the received number(s). This may be achieved by examining a look-up table that
   has a range of numbers within the range of possible numbers that can be generated by
   the RNG 113 assigned to each available outcome in the game.

                                                    8
                In step 3 the game controller 101 controls the display 106 to display images
   representing the outcome. For example if the game is a spinning reel game, the game
   controller 101 controls the display to display representations of reels in a stopped
   position to reveal a plurality symbols. Embodiments of the invention may be
 5 implemented as various different types of spinning reel games, card games, dice
   games, keno games and other games. The games may be stand-alone games, or
   group play games.
                In step 4 the game controller determines whether the outcome results in the
10 award of an award. This is determined from a pay table 7 and from the game rules 8.
   Taking again the example of a spinning reel game, a combination of three kings
   appearing along a pay line in the three leftmost reels may be specified in the pay table
   7 to pay an award of 18 credits.
15              If no award is to be made, the process returns to step 1 via any other
   processes (step 6) that may occur with each game play or on a random basis. For
   example, the game may involve providing a second chance game or play certain
   animations between game plays. If an award is to be made, then this is performed in
   step 5, which for an award paid in credits, typically involves incrementing a win meter
20 by the amount of the award and subsequently increasing the value of the appropriate
   credit meter 104, optionally with one or more intervening game events, for example
   providing a secondary game in which the player is given a chance to either double the
   award or lose the award.
25              The award may include the award of a feature game with pay characteristics
   that result in a positive value award, the actual value for a particular play of the feature
   game varying for each game play. Other awards may be able to be won, for example a
   jackpot, a progressive jackpot, or a fixed prize like a car. Some prizes may be awarded
   independent of the game outcome, for example based on the cumulative wagers
30 placed on the gaming machine as in the case of a mystery jackpot, or based on an
   event having a probability related to the contribution to turnover on the gaming
   machine that a wager makes, as in the case of Aristocrat's Hyperlink T M system. After
   the award has been paid, then the process returns to step 1, via any other processes 6
   that may be provided, which may be the same or different from the other processes
35 provided when the game outcome is not associated with an award.

                                                      9
                 As will become apparent from the following description, embodiments of the
    invention involve variations to the structure of a typical pay table and typical game
    rules. In typical game rules, a player stakes a certain wager, for example 10 credits on
  5 each of 10 pay lines in a spinning reel game for a total wager of 100 credits.
    Alternatively and often substantially equivalently, the player may wager 10 credits on
    one pay line for 10 games, for total wager over the 10 games of 100 credits. In return,
    the player is given the chance to win one or more prizes as specified in the game pay
    table.
10
                 In this description of embodiments of the invention, the term 'return' has been
    used to refer to the average expected award from play of a wagering game. For
    example in a simple game with outcomes that occur with equal probability that provide
    awards of 0, 2 and 4, the return is 2. The term 'return to player' has been used to refer
15  to the average expected net result when the wager staked to obtain the return is
    considered. For example, taking the same simple game, if the player was required to
    wager 3 credits to play the game, the return would be -0.33 for each credit wagered or
    66%. Doubling the bet on an outcome of the game may result in a doubling of the
    return if the awards are doubled, but the return to player would remain constant.
20
                 To achieve a return to player percentage below 100%, then on average, if a
    player wagered 100 credits, that player can expect to receive less than 100 credits in
    return. A typical distribution of wins and losses is shown in Figure 5. For an example
    game in which 10 credits are wagered to purchase each game play, then the player
25  can expect over 100 games:
          *      60 games (a 0.60 probability) will be lost (i.e. result in an outcome that awards
                 0 credits);
          *      32 games (a 0.32 probability) will result in an outcome that awards 18 credits;
30        -      6 games (a 0.06 probability) will result in an outcome that awards 36 credits;
                 and
          *      2 games (a 0.02 probability) will result in an outcome that awards 54 credits.
                 Therefore, the player can expect more than half, more particularly 60% of all
35  credits wagered to award a win of zero, which is a loss of the wager. The expected
    10410121_1 (GHMaers) P88025.AU.3

                                                     10
     return for all 100 games is 60 x 0 + 32 x 18      +  6 x 36 +2  x 54 = 900. Because to play
     100 games the player wagered 1000 credits, the expected return to player is -100 or
    -0.1 for each credit wagered. In other words, the return to player is 90%.
  5              If the game rules allowed for a plurality of bets to be wagered on each outcome,
    then this would increase the return but not the expected return to player. For example if
    the player wagered 20 credits on each outcome for a total wager of 2000 credits
    across 100 game plays, then the expected return would be 1800, and the expected
     return to player is -200, which is also -0.1 for each credit wagered.
10
                 A gaming machine of the present invention provides for the possibility of the
     player receiving a negative payment, or penalty, upon the occurrence of certain
     negatively paying events in the game. Therefore, in step 1 the gaming machine 100
    determines whether the player has sufficient credits in the credit meter 104 to cover the
15   maximum negative payment that could eventuate. Alternatively, where a gaming venue
     provides credit facilities to its players, step 1 may involve determining whether there is
    sufficient value in the credit meter 104 or in available credit to cover the maximum
     negative payment that could eventuate. In addition, the player may be actively notified
    of the maximum possible loss for playing the game before step 2 commences.
20
                 Certain embodiments may not necessarily take any wager from the player
    before play of the game. In other embodiments the player may be able to bet in various
    unit amounts, with the effect of magnifying the possible wins and losses in the game.
    Losses and wins may be proportional to the units bet. This may just be a scalar
25  multiplication of the entire game in the same sense as is true of the bet button on many
    previously known video poker machines. Alternatively an increased bet may increase
    the probability of a win, which is an alternative that has been used for progressive
    jackpots where the return is kept constant with respect to the wager size.
30               In still further embodiments the required wager to play a game may be
     negative. A negative wager is actually a payment to the player for playing the game. In
    one embodiment this negative wager is credited to the credit meters 104 upon initiation
    of the game play and before the outcome of the game is communicated to the player.

                The award that is associated with the outcome of the game, which may be
    negative, is then awarded to the win meter and subsequently transferred to the credit
    meter, subject to variation by any intervening game events such as a 'double or
    nothing' feature. A 'double or nothing' feature implemented with the present invention
 5  may operate differently from typical features of this type. This results from the potential
   for negative awards. For example, if the outcome of the game is a negative award of
    10 credits, the player may be given the chance to double the award or receive a zero
   award. In this case, a double award would result in an increased negative outcome of
   20 credits and a zero award would represent a win from the 'double or nothing' feature.
10  If the outcome of the game was a positive award of 10 credits, then achieving the
   'double' result would be a winning outcome and the 'nothing' result a losing outcome,
   as is normal.
                Intervening games may be provided other than a 'double or nothing' game. An
15 example may be a game where the player gambles their positive or negative award on
   a card, dice or spinning reel game, with the chance to increase or decrease the award
   that they currently have in the win meter.
                Referring to the main game (i.e. as opposed to an intervening game), by
20 appropriate selection of the positive and negative payments, together with the required
    positive or negative wager, if any, required to play, the return to player of a game of the
    present invention can be designed to be mathematically equivalent to other typical
   wagering games. Existing games could be transformed into a game that plays in
   accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, with appropriate adaptation
25 of the pay table and adaptation of the game rules if necessary.
                In certain embodiments, the possibility of negative payments may be controlled
    by the player. This control may be achieved, for example, by the player specifying what
   wager they wish to stake. An example of this embodiment is provided in Example 1
30  herein below. Alternatively, a separate selection may be made, for example by the
    player operating the touch screen 107A or a button in the bank of buttons 107B, as to
   whether negative payments are possible, in which case the same value wager could
    result in different pay tables depending on the selection.

                As will become apparent from the following description, embodiments of the
   present invention allow the most common result of a game to be one that gives an
   award greater than the return for the game. In some embodiments the most common
   award may also be greater than the amount wagered to play the game.
 5
                Some previously known games may have a component that has as the most
   common result an outcome that awards an amount greater than the return for the
   overall game or the amount wagered to play the game. For example a game may
   include a feature game component with these characteristics that is triggered on a
10 random or quasi-random basis. Overall however, the most common result in the game
   is one that provides an award that is less than the return of the game, for example an
   award of zero credits. Embodiments described herein include games, which when
   considered overall, have as their most common result an award that is greater in value
   than the return for the game. Embodiments described herein also include games in
15 which the most common result is greater than the wager required to play the game.
   The game may still retain a return to player less than 100%. These embodiments may
   or may not include feature games or other components that individually have a positive
   contribution to the return to player.
20              Example 1 - A dice game
                An example embodiment is in the form of a dice game where each side of the
   die occurs with equal probability. A range of wager options is provided from -5 through
   0 to +5 and a listing of the prizes payable on each outcome of the dice game is
25 provided in Table 1. Each wager option may represent a distinct game where only that
   wager option is available. Alternatively, the wager options may all be available in a
   single game, with the awards varying depending on what wager option is selected. The
   information in Table 1 forms part of the pay table 7 and is stored in the memory 103.
30              If the player wagers 1 credit upon the roll of a dice, then the prize listing
   specifies an award of 0 credits for dice results 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This results in a loss of 1
   credit to the player. An award of 5 credits is made for a dice result of 6. The return,
   which is calculated as sum of the awards that can be won divided by the number of
   possible game outcomes, is 5/6. The return to player, which is the return less the
35 wager required to play the game, is -1/6 credits. Of course, if different outcomes
   10410121_1 (GHMaers) P88025.AU.3

                                                         13
   occurred with different probability, then the calculation of the return would be weighted
   accordingly, for example as described herein in relation to the win distributions shown
   in Figures 5 and 6.
 5              If the player wagers 0 credits to play the game, the (negative) award of -1 credit
   is awarded for dice results 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and 6 credits is awarded for a dice result of
   6. This results in the same expected return to player of -1/6 credits. Table 1 shows the
   return and the return to player for all of the wager options -5 to +5, which all give a
   return to player of -1/6 credits.
10
                In the leftmost column the player is paid 5 credits to play a game in which dice
   results from 1 to 5 award -6 credits (so that the net result is a deduction of 1 credit) and
   a 6 on the dice pays -1 credit (so that the net result is a payment of 1 credit). In the
   rightmost column 5 credits are wagered, in order to play a game with awards of 4
15 credits for dice results from 1 to 5 and an award of 9 credits for a dice result of 6. For
   each wager option, the awards are adjusted so as to create a different game that is
   mathematically equivalent in terms of return to player to the games played with the
   other wager options.

                 This range of wager options is only one example of many possible variations.
    Other games may have only a selection of these wager options, for example -5, -3, 0,
    3, 5. Other games may have different ranges of wager options, including only positive
  5 or only negative wagers. Other games may have only a single wager option.
                 Whether the wager is positive or negative, the wager has an immediate effect
    on the credit meters. Accordingly, the negative wagers are different from other
    payments in credits that a gaming machine makes, which are made to a win meter and
10  then subsequently transferred to the credit meter.
                 The awards payable for each outcome of the game may also be varied. Table 1
    shows a range of possibilities for different wager options, including all losing outcomes
    if a negative wager of 5 credits is made, all winning outcomes if a positive wager of 4
15  credits is made, and others with a mixture of winning and losing outcomes.
                 To provide variety, it is expected that having a mixture of winning and losing
    outcomes may be the most entertaining and therefore in some embodiments all wager
    options may have a mixture of winning and losing outcomes. To ensure equality
20  between wager options, the awards are selected so that the return to player is the
    same, calculated as the average return across all possible outcomes of the game
    minus the wager staked to play the game.
                 Example 2
25
                 A traditional game may involve a skewed distribution of results where the peak
    is below the mean. In other words, the average return is greater than what is most
    often achieved. In many games the average return is rarely exceeded. From the point
    of view of the player this result may be disappointing. An example win distribution of
30  this type is shown in Figure 5. A peak in the distribution occurs at an award of zero,
    which is well below the expected return of 9 credits.
                 If the pay table is modified so that a win of 18 credits is awarded instead of the
    award of zero credits and new negative wins are introduced, then the same return to
35  player can be achieved. An example is shown in Figure 6, which has the same win
    10410121_1 (GHMaers) P88025.AU.3

                                                     15
   distribution as in Figure 5, but with different awards. Over 100 games, the player can
   expect on average that:
         *      60 games (a 0.60 probability) will result in an outcome that awards 18 credits;
 5       -      32 games (a 0.32 probability) will result in an outcome that awards 0 credits;
         *      6 games (a 0.06 probability) will result in an outcome that awards -18 credits;
                and
         *      2 games (a 0.02 probability) will result in an outcome that awards -36 credits.
10              The most common result is now a positive outcome of 18 credits, which is
   balanced by the existence of some large losses among the possible results. In the
   example shown in Figure 6, the awards have been selected to result in the same
   expected return of 9 credits per game play. In terms of return to player, the player over
   100 games can expect to return 900 credits for the 1000 credits wagered, or -0.1 per
15 credit.
                The most common result of the game (18 credits) is a win that is larger than the
   wager staked to play the game (10 credits). This result is also larger than the return of
   the game (9 credits), in this example twice as large. This higher than average most
20 common result may add interest for some players in comparison to the win distribution
   shown in Figure 5, despite the equivalent expected return to player.
                A most common result of an award worth more than 1.5 times the wager may
   provide particular entertainment to a player. In addition, a most common result that
25 results in an award worth approximately 1.5 to 2 times the return of the game or more
   may provide particular entertainment to a player.
                This example has been given with reference to a game that costs 10 credits to
   play. For example, in a spinning reel game with a single pay line on which the player
30 can wager, then each spin of the reels will cost 10 credits. Other examples may require
   another wager amount to play, with appropriate modification of the magnitude of the
   awards for each available outcome.

                The pay and return in the columns headed 'Traditional game' show a situation
   with large positive wins occurring with small probability and smaller wins and 0 results
   occurring with larger probabilities. This structure is common in traditional gaming
   machines. The return is 12 credits but a lesser result (either 10 credits or 0 credits) is
15 achieved with high probability (0.7). The wager required to play each game may be set
   at 13 credits to maintain a negative return to player.
                In the columns headed 'Negative win game', an award above return (14 or 24
   credits) occurs more than half the time (0.3 and 0.4 probability respectively). More
20 specifically, an award above return occurs with a probability of 0.7. As before, the
   return is maintained at 12 credits. In this example there is a 0.1 possibility of a negative
   award of -26 credits.

                 Additional features
                 Games that include negative wins may be combined with other features that
    are provided with games having a more traditional pay distribution.
20
                 For example, the games may fund a progressive jackpot. Taking for example
    the 'Negative win game 2' shown in Table 3, for each wager made, 0.9 credits may be
    added to a progressive win meter. This would result in an overall expected return of
    10410121_1 (GHMaers) P88025.AU.3

                                                    18
   -0.1. Alternatively, a fixed prize worth $10,000 may be won by the gaming machine, or
   a gaming machine in a group of linked gaming machines with identical or substantially
   the same expected returns with a win probability of 0.009% for each game played.
 5              A feature game may be provided, which then determines an award from the
   game. For example in the negative win game shown in Table 2, a feature game may
   be triggered on a symbol combination or other event that triggers a feature game may
   occur with a probability of 0.7. There could then be two results from the feature game,
   one awarding 14 credits and the other awarding 24 credits, with 24 credits being
10 awarded in about 57% of the feature games.
                Again referring to the negative win game shown in Table 2, an alternative
   feature game could occur with a probability of 0.50, in other words every second game.
   The feature game could then have two outcomes, one resulting in a negative award of
15 -26 and the other resulting in an award of +24. The -26 award would occur in 20% of
   the feature games and the +24 award would occur in 80% of the feature games. A
   feature game presentation that depicts the player in a competition where the player
   can win or lose may be appropriate for a feature game that can result in either a
   positive or a negative award. The feature game may give the appearance that there is
20 a skill component involved, for example by receiving a player input prior to showing the
   outcome of the game. The player input may be an attempt to stop a moving indicator in
   a particular location to achieve a win.
