   HOPE AND HAPPINESS KIT
     For many years there has been various an anon poems titled 'Hope and happiness Kit' that has
     consisted of a poem along with various packaging with contents listed in the poem. This 'Hope
     and Happiness Kit' has been re-created in a new unique way i.e. using a different combination
     of mix of contents (as listed below) using packaging that has been presented in a new way:
     SA 5 cent piece
    + A marble
    + A rubber band
    + A piece of string
    + A cotton ball
    + A paper clip
    + A bandage
    + A safety pin
    * An eraser
    * A love heart
    * A toothpick
    * The actual poem, however made into a scroll tied with a piece of string
The poem is as follows:
                                        Hope and Happiness Kit
    +    A 5 cent piece so you can never say that your broke
    +    A marble to replace any that might be lost
    +    A rubber band to stretch yourself beyond your limits
    +    A piece of string to tie up any loose ends
    +    A cotton ball to cushion a rough road
    *    A paper clip to keep it all together
    +-   A bandage to heal wounded feelings
    +    A safety pin for the unexpected
    *    An eraser so you can make your mistakes disappear
    *    A love heart to remind you someone somewhere cares
    *    A toothpick to pick out the good in others including yourself
    Concept and Design:
    To my knowledge a 'Hope and Happiness Kit' has not been made in a newly presented way
    with the same mix of contents as this kit. The kit is designed using a thick cardboard box
    with a glossy taupe coloured glaze with a hessian craft butterfly glued to the boxes lid. No
    packaging of this design exists nor the same elements using the combination of mix that the
    kit contains.
    The kits are to be sold with intention for profits to go towards kits for Cancer Carers at the
    Wollongong Hospital for Cancer Carers to pass onto those families and carers with cancer
    along with those with cancer. Another hope is that if successful that a manufacturer would
    assist to extend its reach across Australia to benefit all cancer carers and families within the
    public hospital system. If further enabled it is then hoped that a percentage of sales will also
    go towards an organisation/residential who assist those with mental illness in transitioning
    from hospitals back into the mainstream community to hopefully lead happy and healthy
    lives.
