                     LIGHT BLOCKING SYSTEM FOR VERTICAL BLIND
   CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
        [0001]     This application claims all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.C. §119 from
 5 U.S. provisional application No. 62421792 filed on November 14, 2016, the entirety of
   which is incorporated by reference herein.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   1. Technical Field
        [0002]     The present invention relates generally to a light blocking system, and
10 more particularly to a light blocking system for a vertical blind, wherein the light blocking
   system is adapted to cover the gap between a headrail and a covering assembly which is
   assembled below, whereby to prevent light from passing through the gap when the
   covering assembly is in a closed state.
   2. Description of Related Art
15      [0003]     A conventional vertical blind is shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, which
   includes a headrail 1 and a plurality of slats 2 hung below the headrail 1, wherein the
   headrail 1 is substantially long and column-shaped, and is transversely installed above a
   window hole in a longitudinal direction thereof, whereby the hung slats 2 could cover the
   window hole. By changing the positions and the angles of the slats 2, the amount of light
20 which is allowed to pass therethrough can be adjusted.
        [0004]     In a circumstance which requires a large amount of light getting in, a
   control member 3 can be manipulated to turn the slats 2 to an angle approximately vertical
   to the longitudinal direction of the headrail 1, as shown in FIG. 1. At this time, the
   distance between every two adjacent slats 2 is the greatest, allowing the most light to pass
25 through. On the contrary, when it needs to block out all light or to maintain privacy, the
   slats 2 should be turned to an angle approximately parallel to the longitudinal direction of
   the headrail 1, wherein a long edge of each of the slats 2 would approach or overlap the
                                                 2

   adjacent slat 2, becoming a screen to block light out, as shown in FIG. 2.
        [0005]     However, for the convenience of installment, the conventional vertical
   blind has a gap 4 left between a top edge of the slats 2 and a bottom of the headrail 1, and
   the gap 4 is not covered by the slats 2. In other words, even when the slats 2 are turned to
 5 the angle parallel to the longitudinal direction of the headrail 1, there would be still light
   passing through the gap, and the privacy in the room may not be fully protected. In
   addition, a section of each of slats 2 near the headrail 1 is usually bored a hole to be hung
   from a clip of a turning mechanism, and these holes would also cause the problem of light
   leakage. Therefore, though vertical blinds are already a commonly used type of window
10 coverings, the design still has room for improvement to provide a better light blocking and
   privacy protection effect, which would benefit the majority of users.
   BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
        [0006]     In view of the above, the objective of the present invention is to provide a
   light blocking system for a vertical blind, which could provide an excellent light blocking
15 effect when the covering assembly of the vertical blind is closed.
        [0007]     The present invention provides a light blocking system, which is adapted to
   be used in a vertical blind. The vertical blind includes a headrail, a control mechanism,
   and a covering assembly, wherein a gap is formed between the headrail and the covering
   assembly. The control mechanism includes an operable portion, a motion portion, and a
20 plurality of clips, wherein the motion portion is provided in the headrail. The covering
   assembly includes a plurality of slats, wherein each of the slats is suspended from one of
   the clips with an end thereof, and therefore is hung below the headrail. Each of the clips is
   rotatably connected to the motion portion. The operable portion is exposed out of the
   headrail to be operated, and drives the motion portion when operated, whereby to turn the
25 slats in situ relative to the headrail, so that the covering assembly is adapted to be
   sequentially changed between a closed state, a fully open state, and another closed state.
                                                  3

   When the covering assembly is in the closed state and the another closed state, the slats
   overlaps each other to block out light, wherein a surface of each of the slats faces opposite
   directions when the covering assembly is in the closed state and in the another closed state;
   when the covering assembly is in the fully open state, each of the slats is substantially
 5 perpendicular to a longitudinal direction of the headrail, which allows a most amount of
   light to pass through. The slats are operable to move back and forth in the longitudinal
   direction of the headrail. The light blocking system includes a cover plate, which is
   disposed corresponding to the gap, and covers the gap when the covering assembly is in
   the closed state.
10     [0008]       In an embodiment, the cover plate also covers the gap when the covering
   assembly is in the another closed state.
       [0009]       In an embodiment, the cover plate is movable along with operation of the
   control mechanism. When the slats are driven to turn by the control mechanism, the cover
   plate is also driven by the control mechanism to cover or expose the gap.
15     [0010]       In an embodiment, the light blocking system further includes a driving
   module connected to the control mechanism, wherein, when the control mechanism drives
   the slats to turn, the driving module is also driven by the control mechanism to move the
   cover plate.
       [0011]       In an embodiment, the motion portion includes a led wheel, a link wheel,
20 and a link shaft, wherein each of the clips is rotatably connected to the link shaft. The
   operable portion is adapted to be operated to drive the led wheel to rotate, and the led
   wheel drives the link wheel to rotate while being driven by the operable portion, so as to
   drive the link shaft to rotate as well, whereby to turn the slats in situ relative to the
   headrail. The driving module includes a mounting portion and a pushing portion, wherein
25 the mounting portion is provided corresponding to the link shaft, and is synchronously
   movable with the link shaft. The pushing portion extends outward from the mounting
                                                 4

   portion, and a free end of the pushing portion optionally abuts against the cover plate. A
   maximum distance between the mounting portion and the free end of the pushing portion
   is greater than a distance between the mounting portion and the cover plate when the cover
   plate completely covers the gap. When the mounting portion rotates, the mounting portion
 5 drives the pushing portion to optionally push against the cover plate, so that the cover
   plate is pivotable relative to the headrail to cover or expose the gap.
        [0012]     In an embodiment, the mounting portion is connected to one of the clips or
   the led wheel, so that the mounting portion is synchronously movable with the link shaft.

15 disposed between the driving portion and the pushing portion, wherein a segment of the
   mounting portion corresponding to the driving portion is provided with teeth to mesh with
   the external teeth of the driving portion, so that the mounting portion is drivable by the
   driving portion. A side of the pushing portion facing the mounting portion is provided
   with a toothed rack, and a segment of the mounting portion corresponding to the pushing
20 portion is provided with teeth to mesh with the toothed rack. When the driving portion is
   rotated by the link shaft, the mounting portion drives the pushing portion to move back
   and forth in a direction parallel to a transverse direction of the headrail, whereby to
   optionally push against the cover plate.
        [0015]     In an embodiment, the motion portion includes a led wheel, a link wheel,
25 and a link shaft, wherein each of the clips is rotatably connected to the link shaft. The
   operable portion is adapted to be operated to drive the led wheel to rotate, and the led
                                                    5

   wheel drives the link wheel to rotate while being driven by the operable portion, so as to
   drive the link shaft to rotate as well, whereby to turn the slats in situ relative to the
   headrail. The driving module includes a driving portion, a mounting portion, and a
   pushing portion, wherein the driving portion fits around the link shaft to be synchronously
 5 moved along with the link shaft. The driving portion has external teeth provided
   therearound. The mounting portion is disposed on a side of the driving portion, and is
   pivotally connected to the headrail; the mounting portion has external teeth provided
   therearound to mesh with the external teeth of the driving portion, so that the mounting
   portion is drivable by the driving portion to pivot relative to the headrail. The pushing
10 portion extends outward from the mounting portion, and is connected to the cover plate.
   When the driving portion is rotated by the link shaft, the mounting portion drives the
   pushing portion to pivot, whereby to pivot the cover plate relative to the headrail.
       [0016]      In an embodiment, the motion portion includes a led wheel, a link wheel,
   and a link shaft, wherein each of the clips is rotatably connected to the link shaft. The
15 operable portion is adapted to be operated to drive the led wheel to rotate, and the led
   wheel drives the link wheel to rotate while being driven by the operable portion, so as to
   drive the link shaft to rotate as well, whereby to turn the slats in situ relative to the
   headrail. The driving module includes a driving portion and a moving portion, wherein the
   driving portion fits around the link shaft to be synchronously moved along with the link
20 shaft, and the driving portion has external teeth provided therearound. The cover plate is
   provided on a side of the headrail, and the moving portion is provided on a surface of the
   cover plate facing the driving portion; the moving portion has a toothed rack meshing with
   the external teeth of the driving portion. When the driving portion rotates, the moving
   portion is driven by the driving portion to move up and down relative to the headrail.
25     [0017]      In an embodiment, the motion portion includes a led wheel, a link wheel,
   and a link shaft, wherein each of the clips is rotatably connected to the link shaft. The
                                                 6

   operable portion is adapted to be operated to drive the led wheel to rotate, and the led
   wheel drives the link wheel to rotate while being driven by the operable portion, so as to
   drive the link shaft to rotate as well, whereby to turn the slats in situ relative to the
   headrail. The driving module includes a driving portion, a transmission member, and a
 5 motion portion, wherein the driving portion fits around the link shaft to be synchronously
   moved along with the link shaft. The motion portion is provided to drive the cover plate,
   and the transmission member connects the driving portion and the motion portion in a way
   that the driving portion and the motion portion move synchronously. When the link shaft
   drives the driving portion to rotate, the driving portion drives the motion portion to rotate,
10 and drives the cover plate to pivot about the motion portion.
        [0018]     In an embodiment, the motion portion includes a led wheel, a link wheel,
   and a link shaft, wherein each of the clips is rotatably connected to the link shaft. The
   operable portion is adapted to be operated to drive the led wheel to rotate, and the led

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
       [00109]     A vertical blind 100 which uses a light blocking system of the first
   embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 3 to FIG. 6, wherein the vertical
25 blind 100 includes a headrail 110, a covering assembly hung below the headrail 110, a
   control mechanism 130, and a light blocking system 180. The light blocking system 180
                                                  16

   includes a front cover plate 182 and a rear cover plate 184, which are respectively
   provided on opposite sides below the headrail 110 in a longitudinal direction of the
   headrail 110. Two ends of the headrail 110 in the longitudinal direction thereof are
   respectively    covered   by   end   caps   1102,   whereby    to  prevent the    components
 5 accommodated therein from being seen from outside. The covering assembly includes a
   plurality of slats 120, and a gap 140 is left between a bottom of the headrail 110 and a top
   edge of the slats 120. The front cover plate 182 and the rear cover plate 184 respectively
   cover a front side and a rear side of the gap 140. The control mechanism 130 is provided
   in the headrail 110, and each of the slats 120 is connected to the control mechanism 130
10 with an end thereof. The control mechanism 130 is controllable to drive the slats 120 to
   turn.
        [00110]     FIG. 3 to FIG. 4 are views showing the condition when the slats 120 of the
   vertical blind 100 are turned to an angle which is approximately perpendicular to the
   longitudinal direction of the headrail 110. In this condition, a maximum amount of light is
15 allowed to pass through the space between the slats 120, and herein we define the
   covering assembly is in a fully open state (this definition also stands in each of the
   subsequent embodiments). On the other hand, FIG. 5 to FIG. 6 are views showing the
   condition when the slats 120 are turned to an angle substantially parallel to the
   longitudinal direction of the headrail 110. In this condition, a long edge of each of the slats
20 120 approaches, or even overlaps, the adjacent one of the slats 120, so that the slats 120
   become a screen, and therefore light would not be able to pass the region covered by the
   slats 120. Herein we define the covering assembly is in a closed state at this time (this
   definition stands in each of the subsequent embodiments as well). In addition, the slats
   120 could be also turned over 180 degrees to another angle which is also substantially
25 parallel to the longitudinal direction of the headrail 110 (not shown), and herein we define
   the covering assembly is in another closed state at this time (this definition, again, stands
                                                  17

   in the subsequent embodiments). More specifically, a surface of each of the slats 120 faces
   completely opposite directions when the covering assembly is in the closed state and in
   the another closed state. Furthermore, light would be not allowed to pass the region
   covered by the slats 120 as well when the covering assembly is in the another closed state.
 5 The control mechanism 130 is controllable to turn the slats 120. Since the techniques
   regarding the control mechanism 130 are well-known, and are not claimed features of the
   present invention, we are not going to describe them in details. However, for the ease of
   understanding the disclosures of the present invention, we still provide a rough description
   in the following paragraph.
10      [00111]    In general, the control mechanism 130 includes an operable portion, a
   motion portion, and a plurality of clips. The operable portion is exposed out of the headrail
   110 to be operated, and is the only component of the control mechanism 130 visible in the
   drawings corresponding to the current embodiment. Other components of the control
   mechanism 130 are not explicitly illustrated in the drawings. In each of the drawings of
15 the subsequent embodiments, these components will not be particularly shown either,
   unless the control mechanism has specific interactions or worth-mentioning structural
   relationship with the light blocking system. Take the vertical blind 100 which uses the
   light blocking system of the first embodiment of the present invention as an example. The
   clips are used to suspend the slats 120 of the covering assembly. In more details, each of
20 the slats 120 is suspended from one of clips with an end thereof, and therefore the slats
   120 are hung below the headrail 110. Furthermore, the clips are connected to a link shaft
   in a rotatable manner. In this way, the link shaft can be used to control the clips, whereby
   to synchronously turn the slats 120 by the same angle. The operable portion can be
   operated to rotate a led wheel, which is engaged with a link wheel, and the link wheel is
25 engaged with the link shaft. With such design, when the led wheel is driven to rotate, the
                                                 18

   link wheel is also driven to rotate, and therefore the link shaft is driven to rotate as well.
   As a result, the slats 120 can be turned in situ relative to the headrail 110.
        [00112]     In the current embodiment, the gap 140 between the bottom of the headrail
   110 and the top edge of the slats 120 is always covered by the front cover plate 182 and
 5 the rear cover plate 184. Therefore, when the covering assembly is in the closed state, the
   light would be able to pass neither the region covered by the slats 120 nor the gap 140,
   which could effectively prevent light leakage. Furthermore, in the current embodiment,
   the front cover plate 182 and the rear cover plate 184 both slightly incline toward a rear
   side (i.e., in a direction toward the window), whereby the light coming from the rear side
10 of the vertical blind 100 can be blocked out more thoroughly.
        [00113]     A vertical blind 200 using the light blocking system of the second
   embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 7 to FIG. 11, wherein the vertical
   blind 200 includes a headrail 210, a covering assembly hung below the headrail 210, a
   control mechanism 230, and a light blocking system 280. The covering assembly includes
15 a plurality of slats 220. In the current embodiment, the light blocking system 280 includes
   a front cover plate 282 and a rear cover plate 284, and the headrail 210 is provided with a
   front groove 212 and a rear groove 214. The front cover plate 282 and the rear cover plate
   284 are long plates, wherein a lateral edge of the front cover plate 282 in a longitudinal
   direction thereof is pivotally provided in the front groove 212, while a lateral edge of the
20 rear cover plate 284 is pivotally provided in the rear groove 214; another lateral edge of
   each of the front and the rear cover plates is a free end, which can be lifted relative to the
   headrail 210. A gap 240 is left between a bottom of the headrail 210 and a top edge of the
   slats 220, and the front cover plate 282 and the rear cover plate 284 respectively cover a
   front side and a rear side of the gap 240. In the current embodiment, the front groove 212
25 and the rear groove 214 are provided on a top of the headrail 210, but this is not a
   limitation of the present invention. The front cover plate 282 and the rear cover plate 284
                                                   19

   could be also provided on the front and rear sides or on the bottom of the headrail 210 to
   meet different requirements, as long as the front cover plate 282 and the rear cover plate
   284 could cover the front and the rear sides of the gap 240.
        [00114]     FIG. 7 to FIG. 10 are different views showing the condition when the
 5 covering assembly of the vertical blind 200 is in the fully open state, wherein an angle of
   the slats 220 is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the headrail 210,
   and two end corners of the top edge of each of the slats 220 respectively pushes the front
   cover plate 282 and the rear cover plate 284, so that the front cover plate 282 and the rear
   cover plate 284 are lifted upward and outward. When the control mechanism 230 is
10 operated to change the covering assembly into the closed state, as shown in FIG. 11, the
   angle of the slats 220 is substantially parallel to the longitudinal direction of the headrail
   210, and the front cover plate 282 and the rear cover plate 284 droop naturally for not
   being pushed by the end corners of the top edges of the slats 220. As a result, not only the
   slats 220 completely block out the light, the front cover plate 282 and the rear cover plate
15 284 would also cover the gap 240 between the slats 220 and the headrail 210 to prevent
   the light from passing therethrough. Therefore, the vertical blind 200 could have an
   excellent light blocking performance when its covering assembly is in the closed state.
        [00115]     As mentioned above, the slats 220 could be turned by 180 degrees. After
   the slats 220 are turned from an angle parallel to the longitudinal direction of the headrail
20 210 (i.e., the covering assembly is in the closed state) to another angle perpendicular to the
   longitudinal direction of the headrail 210 (i.e., the covering assembly is the fully open
   state), the slats 220 could continue to be rotated, and finally reach an angle parallel to the
   longitudinal direction of headrail 210. At this time, the covering assembly is moved into
   the another closed state. A surface of each of the slats 200 faces complete opposite
25 directions when the covering assembly is in the another closed state and in the original
   closed state. Furthermore, during the process that the covering assembly has gone beyond
                                                 20

   the fully open state and continues to be changed toward the another closed state, the front
   cover plate 282 and the rear cover plate 284 would change from the lifted condition to the
   naturally drooping condition along with the rotation of the slats 220. Whereby, when the
   covering assembly is in the another closed state, the front cover plate 282 and the rear
 5 cover plate 284 would also cover the gap 240 between the slats 220 and the headrail 210.
        [00116]    A vertical blind 300 using a light blocking system of the third embodiment
   of the present invention is shown in FIG. 12 to FIG. 14, wherein the vertical blind 300
   includes a headrail 310, a covering assembly hung below the headrail 310, a control
   mechanism 330, and a light blocking system 380. The covering assembly includes a
10 plurality of slats 320, and the light blocking system 380 in the current embodiment
   includes a front cover plate 382 and a rear cover plate 384, which are both long plates.
   Each of the front cover plate 382 and the rear cover plate 384 is fixedly connected to the
   headrail 310 with a lateral edge in a longitudinal direction thereof, and another lateral edge
   is a free end, which could be lifted relative to the headrail 310. The ways to connect the
15 front and the rear cover plates 382, 384 and the headrail 310 are not limitations of the
   present invention. In the current embodiment, these components are fixed with glues, but
   nails, magnets, hook-and-loop fasteners, and other removable or irremovable means would
   be also acceptable. The positions to fix the front and the rear cover plates 382, 384 are not
   limitations of the present invention, either. In the current embodiment, the front cover
20 plate 382 and the rear cover plate 384 are connected to a top of the headrail 310, but could
   be also connected to a front and rear sides or inner sides of the headrail 310.
        [00117]    A gap 340 is left between a bottom of the headrail 310 and a top edge of
   the slats 320, and the front cover plate 382 and the rear cover plate 384 respectively cover
   the front and rear sides of the gap 340. Similar to the previous embodiment, the front
25 cover plate 382 and the rear cover plate 384 would cover the gap 340 when the covering
   assembly of the vertical blind 300 is in the closed state, which could prevent the problem
                                                 21

   of light leakage. On the other hand, when the covering assembly of the vertical blind 300
   is changed into the fully open state by driving the control mechanism 330, the front cover
   plate 382 and the rear cover plate 384 would be pushed by the end corners of the top of
   each of the slats 320, and therefore respectively get lifted forward and rearward.
 5      [00118]    It is worth mentioning that, in the current embodiment, each of the front
   cover plate 382 and the rear cover plate 384 respectively includes a drooping portion 3822,
   3842 and a covering portion 3824, 3844, wherein a segment thereof corresponding to the
   headrail 310 is the drooping portion 3822, 3842, and another segment thereof
   corresponding to the gap 340 is the covering portion 3824, 3844. Herein we take the front
10 cover plate 382 for example. In order to make an upper half of the front cover plate 382
   close to the headrail 310, the drooping portion 3822 could be made of soft fabrics or
   plastics, but hard cardboards, metals, or plastics would be also applicable. As for the
   covering portion 3824, it should be suitable to be pushed by the corresponding end corner
   of the top of each of the slats 320, and therefore would be made of hard and opaque
15 materials such as hard cardboards, hard plastics, or metals. With such design, the materials
   and the patterns of the drooping portion 3822 and the covering portion 3824 could match
   each other. When in the condition of allowing light to pass through, the angel of the
   drooping portion 3822 would barely change while the covering portion 3824 is pushed by
   the slats 320 to move upward and outward, which could keep an appearance of the
20 headrail 310 unchanged.
        [00119]    Similar to the light blocking system 200 mentioned in the second
   embodiment, in the current embodiment, while the covering assembly is changing toward
   the another closed state after going through the fully open state, the front cover plate 382
   and the rear cover plate 384 (or more specifically, the covering portions 3824, 3844) of the
25 light blocking system 380 would also gradually return to the naturally drooping condition
                                                 22

   from the lifted condition. In this way, the light blocking system 380 could also cover the
   gap 340 when the covering assembly is in the another closed state.
       [00120]     In addition, the connection between the drooping portions 3822, 3842 and
   the covering portions 3824, 3844 could be done at least in the following methods: (1) a
 5 length of each of the drooping portions 3822, 3842 equals a total length of the front cover
   plate 382 or the rear cover plate 384, and the segments corresponding to the gap 340 are
   covered by a hard material to form the covering portions 3824, 3844; (2) the drooping
   portions 3822, 3842 and the covering portions 3824, 3844 are independent components,
   and are connected by gluing, stitching, hinging, or in other ways to achieve a pivotable
10 connection therebetween; (3) the drooping portions 3822, 3842 and the covering portions
   3824, 3844 are directly made through extrusion molding with a soft material and a hard
   material.
       [00121]     It needs to be clarified that, the front cover plate s182, 282, 382 and the
   rear cover plates 184, 284, 384 mentioned in the aforementioned three embodiments are
15 not necessary to be presented both; one of the front and the rear cover plates could be also
   omitted, and the length of each of the cover plates are not a limitation of the present
   invention, as long as the light coming from the rear side of the vertical blind 100, 200, 300
   could be blocked out.
       [00122]     A vertical blind 400 using a light blocking system of the fourth
20 embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 15 to FIG. 21, wherein the vertical
   blind 400 includes a headrail 410, a covering assembly hung below the headrail 410, a
   control mechanism 430, and a light blocking system 480. The covering assembly includes
   a plurality of slats 420, and a gap 450 is left between a bottom of the headrail 410 and a
   top edge of the slats 420. The light blocking system 480 includes a driving module, a front
25 cover plate 482, and a rear cover plate 484, wherein the driving module in the current
   embodiment is a pushing member 486. The pushing member 486 has a mounting portion
                                                  23

   provided at a center thereof, and the mounting portion in the current embodiment is an
   engaging portion 4862 which has a through hole, whereby the pushing member 486 could
   fit around the control mechanism 430 at a location near the headrail 410. As a result, the
   mounting portion (i.e., the engaging portion 4862) would move synchronously with a link
 5 shaft 438 of the control mechanism 430. The link shaft 438 mentioned herein is a
   component of the control mechanism 430 used to synchronously turn the slats 420. The
   front cover plate 482 and the rear cover plate 484 are provided below the headrail 410 in a
   longitudinal direction of the headrail 410 in a pivotable manner, and cover the pushing
   member 486.
10      [00123]    FIG. 15 to FIG. 19 are different views showing the condition when the
   covering assembly of the vertical blind 400 is in the closed state, wherein the front cover
   plate 482 and the rear cover plate 484 naturally droop to cover the gap 450 at the same
   time, preventing light from passing therethrough. The arrangements of the pushing
   member 486 and the control mechanism 430 are shown in FIG. 16 and FIG. 19, and FIG.
15 16 omits the headrail 410 to clearly show the components inside, wherein the control
   mechanism 430 has a led wheel 432 provided at a top end thereof, and has a hook portion
   434 provided at a bottom end thereof to suspend an operation rod 436. However, the
   structural arrangements of the control mechanism 430 and the techniques relevant to the
   operation of turning the slats 420 are well-known and are not claimed features of the
20 present invention, so we are not going to describe them in details herein. The pushing
   member 486 has two pushing portions 4864, 4866 extending from the engaging portion
   4862 located at the center thereof, each of which respectively corresponds to the front
   cover plate 482 and the rear cover plate 484. The led wheel 432 of the control mechanism
   430 goes into the headrail 410 to cooperate with a turning mechanism of the slats 420. In
25 more details, the pushing member 486 fits around an outside of an end of the hook portion
   434 corresponding to the led wheel 432 to be synchronously rotated along with the led
                                                24

   wheel 432. An extending length between each of the pushing portions 4864, 4866 and the
   engaging portion 4862 in a radial direction of the engaging portion 4862 is greater than a
   distance between the engaging portion 4862 and each of the front cover plate 482 and the
   rear cover plate 484.
 5       [00124]   FIG. 20 and FIG. 21 are different views showing the condition when the
   covering assembly of the vertical blind 400 is in the fully open state. By rotating the
   operation rod 436 of the control mechanism 430 to drive the led wheel 432, the slats 420
   would be driven to rotate. At the same time, the pushing member 486 would also rotate
   synchronously along with the led wheel 432 in the same direction. When an angle of the
10 slats 420 is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the headrail 410
   (i.e., when the covering assembly is in the fully open state), the pushing portions 4864,
   4866 of the pushing member 486 would respectively push and lift the front cover plate
   482 and the rear cover plate 484 upward and outward.
         [00125]   It is worth mentioning that, while the covering assembly is changing
15 toward the another closed state after going through the fully open state, the pushing
   portions 4864, 4866 of the pushing member 486 would gradually leave the front cover
   plate 482 and the rear cover plate 484, so that the front cover plate 482 and the rear cover
   plate 484 would naturally droop as not being pushed anymore. In this way, the gap 450
   could be also covered when the covering assembly is in the another closed state.
20       [00126]   In the current embodiment, the pushing member 486 fits around the control
   mechanism 430 to be synchronously rotated along with the operation of the control
   mechanism 430. However, this is not a limitation of the present invention. The pushing
   member 486 could also fit around the turning mechanism of the slats 420, which could
   also provide the same function which synchronously operates the control mechanism 430
25 and the slats 420, so that the front cover plate 482 and the rear cover plate 484 could be
                                                25

   still pushed and lifted upward and outward when the covering assembly is in the fully
   open state.
        [00127]     Furthermore, the pushing member 486 could be used with a restriction
   mechanism. For example, the headrail 410 could have a bump provided on a bottom
 5 thereof, wherein the bump is located at a position corresponding to the covering assembly
   which is in the fully open state, so that the pushing member 486 would abut against the
   restriction mechanism and stop rotating when the slats 420 are rotated to be substantially
   perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the headrail 410. At the same time, the led
   wheel 432 and the pushing member 486 would have sliding movements therebetween, so
10 that the led wheel 432 could rotate relative to the pushing member 486, and therefore the
   control mechanism 430 could be still used to adjust the angle of the slats 420. At this time,
   the front cover plate 482 and the rear cover plate 484 would remain in the condition as
   being pushed upward by the pushing member 486.
        [00128]     A vertical blind 500 using a light blocking system of the fifth embodiment
15 of the present invention is shown in FIG. 22 to FIG. 29, wherein the vertical blind 500
   includes a headrail 510, a covering assembly hung below the headrail 510, a control
   mechanism 530, and a light blocking system 580. The covering assembly includes a
   plurality of slats 520, and a gap 550 is left between a bottom of the headrail 510 and a top
   edge of the slats 520. The light blocking system 580 includes a front cover plate 582 and a
20 rear cover plate 584, which are pivotably provided below the headrail 510 in a
   longitudinal direction of the headrail 510. The light blocking system 580 further includes a
   driving module, which is a pushing mechanism 586 in the current embodiment. The
   pushing mechanism 586 includes a mounting portion and a pushing portion 5864, wherein
   the mounting portion is a rotary portion 5862 in the current embodiment. The mounting
25 portion (i.e., the rotary portion 5862) is provided in the headrail 510, and is adapted to be
   controlled by the control mechanism 530 to synchronously rotate along with the turning of
                                                  26

   the slats 520. More specifically, a rotation angle of the rotary portion 5862 equals a
   rotation angle of the slats 520. The pushing portion 5864 is a long rod, which is connected
   to an end of the rotary portion 5862 closer to the slats 520 with a center thereof. The
   pushing portion 5864 is located higher than a bottom edge of the front cover plate 582 and
 5 a bottom edge of the rear cover plate 584, and a length in a longitudinal direction thereof
   is greater than a distance between the front cover plate 582 and the rear cover plate 584.
        [00129]    FIG. 22 to FIG. 25 are different views showing the condition when the
   covering assembly of the vertical blind 500 is in the closed state. In FIG. 22 and FIG. 23,
   the front cover plate 582 and the rear cover plate 584 naturally droop to cover the gap 550
10 at the same time, whereby light would not be able to pass therethrough. In FIG. 24, the
   vertical blind 500 is in the closed state, wherein the headrail 510, the front cover plate 582,
   and the rear cover plate 584 are omitted. FIG. 25 is a bottom view showing the condition
   when the covering assembly is in the closed state, and it can be clearly seen that the rotary
   portion 5862 is disposed in the headrail 510, and the pushing portion 5864 below is
15 approximately located at a same height with the gap 550. When an angle of the slats 520 is
   substantially parallel to a longitudinal direction of the headrail 510 (i.e., when the
   covering assembly is in the closed state), the angle of the pushing portion 5864 is
   consistent with the angle of the slats 520. As a result, the front cover plate 582 and the rear
   cover plate 584 could naturally droop, and would have no interference from the pushing
20 portion 5864.
        [00130]    FIG. 26 to FIG. 29 are different views showing the condition when the
   covering assembly of the vertical blind 500 is in the fully open state. During the process of
   turning the slats 520 toward an angle substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal
   direction of the headrail 510, the pushing portion 5864 would be rotated by the same angle
25 with the slats 520, and two ends of the pushing portion 5864 in the longitudinal direction
   thereof would push the front cover plate 582 and the rear cover plate 584 before end
                                                  27

   comers of the slats 520. When the covering assembling is changed into the fully open state,
   the pushing portion 5864 would push and lift the front cover plate 582 and the rear cover
   plate 584 upward and outward to allow light to pass therethrough.
        [00131]    Similar to the aforementioned embodiments, while the covering assembly
 5 is changing toward the another closed state after going through the fully open state, the
   pushing portion 5864 of the pushing mechanism 586 would gradually leave the front cover
   plate 582 and the rear cover plate 584, so that the front cover plate 582 and the rear cover
   plate 584 would naturally droop for not being pushed anymore. Whereby, the gap 450
   would be still covered when the covering assembly is in the another closed state.
10      [00132]    A vertical blind 600 using a light blocking system of the sixth embodiment
   of the present invention is shown in FIG. 30 to FIG. 36. Similar to the aforementioned
   vertical blind 500, the vertical blind 600 using the current embodiment includes a headrail
   610, a covering assembly hung below the headrail 610, a control mechanism 630, and a
   light blocking system, wherein the light blocking system includes a front cover plate 682,
15 a rear cover plate 684, and a driving module. The covering assembly includes a plurality
   of slats 620, and a gap 650 is left between a bottom of the headrail 610 and a top edge of
   the slats 620. The front cover plate 682 and the rear cover plate 684 are respectively
   pivotably provided under the headrail 610 in a longitudinal direction of the headrail 610.
   The control mechanism 630 includes a led wheel 632, a hook portion 634, a link wheel
20 636, and a link shaft 638, wherein the led wheel 632 is provided in the headrail 610, and is
   connected to an upper end of the hook portion 634. The hook portion 634 has an operation
   rod suspended below to be operated. The link wheel 636 fits around the link shaft 638 to
   be synchronously moved along with the link shaft 638, and the link shaft 638 is provided
   in a way that the link shaft 638 is synchronously movable with a turning mechanism of the
25 slats 620. Furthermore, the led wheel 632 meshes with the link wheel 636. When the link
   wheel 632 is controlled to rotate, the link wheel 636 and the link shaft 638 would be
                                                 28

   driven to rotate together, whereby to change an angle of the slats 620. The driving module
   is a pushing mechanism 686 in the current embodiment, including a driving portion 6862,
   a mounting portion, and pushing portions 6866. The driving portion 6862 fits around the
   link shaft 638 to be synchronously movable with the link shaft 638, and has external teeth
 5 provided therearound. The mounting portion is a rotary portion 6864 in the current
   embodiment, and has teeth provided on an end thereof to mesh with the driving portion
   6862, whereby to be driven by the driving portion 6862. Each of the pushing portions
   6866 is a toothed rack in the current embodiment, and meshes with another end of the
   rotary portion 6864. When the rotary portion 6864 is controlled to rotate, the pushing
10 portions 6866 would be moved back and forth in a direction parallel to a transverse
   direction of the headrail 610.
        [00133]    FIG. 30 to FIG. 33 are different views showing the condition when the
   covering assembly of the vertical blind 600 is in the closed state. At this time, the pushing
   portions 6866 would be driven by the rotary portion 6864 to move toward the rotary
15 portion 6864, and would locate below the headrail 610. As a result, the front cover plate
   682 and the rear cover plate 684 would naturally droop and cover the gap 650, whereby to
   prevent light from passing through.
        [00134]    FIG. 34 to FIG. 36 are different views showing the condition when the
   covering assembly of the vertical blind 600 is in the fully open state. At this time, the
20 pushing portions 6866 would be driven by the rotary portion 6864 to move outward in the
   transverse direction of the headrail 610. Whereby, an end of each of the pushing portions
   6866 corresponding to the front cover plate 682 and rear cover plate 684 would
   respectively push the front cover plate 682 and the rear cover plate 684, so that the front
   cover plate 682 and the rear cover plate 684 would be pushed outward and lifted upward.
25      [00135]    In the current embodiment, the number of the pushing portion 6866 is two
   to correspond to the front cover plate 682 and the rear cover plate 684. However, this is
                                                29

   not a limitation of the present invention. If there is only one cover plate included in the
   vertical blind, there should be only one pushing portion as well.
        [00136]     A vertical blind 700 using a light blocking system of the seventh
   embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 37 to FIG. 42, which is an
 5 embodiment that the cover plate thereof is pivotable. The vertical blind 700 includes a
   headrail 710, a covering assembly hung below the headrail 710, a control mechanism 730,
   and a light blocking system. The covering assembly includes a plurality of slats 720, and a
   gap 750 is left between a bottom of the headrail 710 and a top edge of the slats 720. The
   light blocking system includes a cover plate 782 and a driving module, wherein the
10 driving module in the current embodiment is a pushing mechanism 786, of which an end
   is connected to the cover plate 782, and another end thereof is provided in a way that the
   pushing mechanism 786 is synchronously movable with the control mechanism 730,
   whereby the pushing mechanism 786 could be driven by the control mechanism 730. The
   cover plate 782 is a long plate, and is provided outside of the headrail 710 in a
15 longitudinal direction of the headrail 710.
        [00137]     The control mechanism 730 is provided in the headrail 710, and includes a
   link shaft 736 sequentially connecting the turning mechanism (i.e., the clip) of each of the
   slats 720, and an operation rod 738 to be operated. When the operation rod 738 is rotated,
   the link shaft 736 would be correspondingly rotated to change an angle of the slats 720.
20 However, such mechanism for adjusting the angle of the slats 720 are conventional, and
   therefore we are not going to describe in details herein. The pushing mechanism 786
   includes a driving portion 7862, a pushing portion 7864, and a mounting portion 7866,
   wherein the driving portion 7862 in the current embodiment is a gear with external teeth,
   and the driving portion 7862 fits around the link shaft 736 to be synchronously moved
25 along with the link shaft 736. The pushing portion 7864 is L-shaped, wherein an end
   thereof is connected to the driving portion 7862 through the mounting portion 7866, and
                                                30

   could be driven by the driving portion 7862 to move between a lowered position and a
   lifted position. Another end of the pushing portion 7864 is fixedly connected to the cover
   plate 782, so that the cover plate 782 could be lowered or lifted along with a movement of
   the pushing portion 7864. In more details, the mounting portion 7866 has external teeth
 5 provided on at least a part of a periphery thereof. In the current embodiment, the external
   teeth of the mounting portion 7866 meshes with the external teeth of the driving portion
   7862 through a plurality of intermediate gears to create an appropriate gear ratio. It is
   worth mentioning that, the mounting portion 7866 has two recesses 78662 provided on the
   periphery thereof, wherein the recesses 78662 have no teeth, and one of them could
10 properly accommodate one of the intermediate gears (which is given a reference number
   788) when the covering assembly is in the fully open state or the closed state. As a result,
   said intermediate gear 788 which falls into one of the recesses 78662 could rotate freely in
   there, as illustrated in FIG. 38 and FIG. 41. Whereby, the cover plate 782 could be
   prevented from over-flipping and hitting the headrail 710 or the slats 720.
15      [00138]     FIG. 37 to FIG. 39 are different views showing the condition when the
   covering assembly of the vertical blind 700 is in the closed state. At this time, the pushing
   portion 7864 is at the lowered position, so that the cover plate 782 which is connected to
   the another end of the pushing portion 7864 corresponding to the driving portion 7862
   would be lowered to cover the gap 750, which could prevent light from passing
20 therethrough.
        [00139]     FIG. 40 to FIG. 42 are different views showing the condition when the
   covering assembly of the vertical blind 700 is in the fully open state. When the turning
   mechanisms of the slats 720 of the vertical blind 700 are driven by the control mechanism
   730 to rotate and change the covering assembly toward the fully open state, the pushing
25 portion 7864 would be also driven to rotate by the driving portion 7862 through the
   mounting portion 7866, so that the pushing portion 7864 would be pivoted clockwise
                                                31

   about the mounting portion 7866 from the lowered position to the lifted position. In other
   words, the end of the pushing portion 7864 connected to the cover plate 782 would be
   moved outward and upward relative to the headrail 710, whereby to lift the cover plate
   782 outward and upward, allowing light to pass through the gap 750. It is worth
 5 mentioning that, if viewed from a front view angle illustrated in FIG. 40, the lifted cover
   plate 782 would cover the headrail 710, whereby to provide a different visual effect.
        [00140]    A vertical blind 800 using a light blocking system of the eighth
   embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 43 to FIG. 48, which is another
   embodiment having a pivotable cover plate. The vertical blind 800 includes a headrail 810,
10 a covering assembly hung below the headrail 810, a control mechanism 830, and a light
   blocking system. The covering assembly includes a plurality of slats 820, and a gap 850 is
   left between a bottom of the headrail 810 and a top edge of the slats 820. The light
   blocking system includes a cover plate 882 and a driving module, wherein the driving
   module in the current embodiment is a pushing mechanism 886, of which an end is
15 connected to the cover plate 882, and another end is provided in a way that the pushing
   mechanism 886 could be synchronously moved along with the control mechanism 830, so
   that the pushing mechanism 886 could be driven by the control mechanism 830 to rotate.
   The cover plate 882 is a long plate, which is provided on an outside of the headrail 810
   along a longitudinal direction of the headrail 810.
20      [00141]    The control mechanism 830 is similar to the control mechanism 730
   cooperating with the aforementioned seventh embodiment, and also has a link shaft 836
   provided in the headrail 810 to sequentially connect the turning mechanism (i.e., the clip)
   of each of the slats 820, and an operation rod 838 to be operated. When the operation rod
   838 is rotated, the link shaft 836 would be synchronously driven to change an angle of the
25 slats 820. The pushing mechanism 886 includes a driving portion 8862, a pushing portion
   8864, and a mounting portion 8866, wherein the driving portion 8862 in the current
                                                 32

   embodiment is a gear with external teeth, and the driving portion 8862 fits around the link
   shaft 836 to be synchronously rotated along with the link shaft 836. The mounting portion
   8866 also has external teeth meshing with the external teeth of the driving portion 8862. In
   more details, the mounting portion 8866 includes a gear 88662 and a cam 88664, and said
 5 external teeth are teeth of the gear 88662. Whereby, the gear 88662 could be driven by the
   driving portion 8862 to further rotate the cam 88664 correspondingly. The pushing portion
   8864 is substantially L-shaped, of which an end has a shape matching the cam 88664, and
   another end is close to the cover plate 882 to optionally abut against the cover plate 882.
   More specifically, with the connection relationship between the pushing portion 8864, the
10 mounting portion 8866, and the driving portion 8862, the pushing portion 8864 could be
   driven by the driving portion 8862, and could raise or lower the end close to the cover
   plate 882 along with the rotation of the cam 88664.
       [00142]     FIG. 43 to FIG. 45 are different views showing the condition when the
   covering assembly of the vertical blind 800 is in the closed state. At this time, the end of

   blind 1300 is in the closed state. The control mechanism 1330 is adapted to pull and move
   the slats 1320 from the side to evenly distribute the slats 1320 under the headrail 1310,
   and during the process of moving the slats 1320, the first cover plate 1382, the second
   cover plate 1384, and the third cover plate 1386 would be also moved one by one, with the
15 stop portion of each of the cover plates 1382, 1384, 1386 contacting and pushing the
   adjacent one of the cover plates 1382, 1384, 1386. In the end, the cover plates 1382, 1384,
   1386 would be also evenly distributed below the headrail 1310 (as shown in FIG. 76 and
   FIG. 78), whereby to completely cover the gap 1350. On the other hand, while the
   covering assembly is changing between the fully open state and the closed state, the
20 condition of each of the cover plates 1382, 1384, 1386 would not change, for the slats
   1320 would not contact the cover plates 1382, 1384, 1386.
        [00165]     In the current embodiment, there are three cover plates corresponding to
   three guide slots, and the cover plates partially overlap each other with one in front of
   another. However, the numbers and the arrangements of the cover plates and the guide
25 slots are not limitations of the present invention. There could be more or less cover plates
   and the guide slots to meet different requirements. In addition, in the current embodiment,
                                                   43

   the cover plates are made of a hard material, but the cover plates could be also made of a
   flexible material in other embodiments. There could be only one cover plate made of a
   flexible material matching one single guide slot, with other arrangements remained
   unchanged as mentioned in the above embodiment. Since the cover plate is flexible, the
 5 cover plate could be folded or bent at a side when the vertical blind is in the collapsed
   state; and when the vertical blind is in the fully open state or the closed state, the cover
   plate would become a planar screen to cover the gap between the headrail and the slats.
        [00166]    A vertical blind 1400 using a light blocking system of the fourteenth
   embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 81 to FIG. 85, which is an
10 embodiment that the cover plates are directly provided on the slats. The vertical blind
   1400 includes a headrail 1410, a covering assembly hung below the headrail 1410, a
   control mechanism 1430, and a light blocking system, wherein the covering assembly
   includes a plurality of slats 1420, and the light blocking system includes a plurality of
   shielding members 1482. Each of the shielding members 1482 is provided on an end of
15 one of the slats 1420 corresponding to the headrail 1410. A gap 1450 is left between the
   slats 1420 and the headrail 1410. The shielding members 1482 are made of a soft material,
   a deformable material, or a flexible material. A height of each of the shielding members
   1482 is equal to or greater than a height of the gap 1450, whereby the gap 1450 could be
   covered.
20      [00167]    In conventional techniques, each of the slats is provided with a through
   hole corresponding to one of the clips of the turning mechanism, so that the slats are
   suspended from the turning mechanism. In other to provide sufficient space to install the
   slats, a gap has to be left in advance between the headrail and the top of the slats. In the
   current embodiment, the through hole 1422 of each of the slats 1420 is still provided at an
25 upper portion of the corresponding slat 1420, and a gap 1450 is still left in advance
   between a top of the slats 1420 and the headrail 1410. However, the shielding members
                                                44

   1482 extending from the top of the slats 1420 is deformable when applied with force.
   Therefore, even though the height of each of the shielding members 1482 is equal to or
   greater than a distance of the gap 1450, the shielding members 1482 would not hinder the
   installation. Furthermore, no matter the covering assembly is in the fully open state or in
 5 the closed state, the shielding members 1482 would always effectively cover the gap 1450
   to prevent light leakage.
        [00168]    In addition, in the current embodiment, each of the shielding members
   1482 and the corresponding slat 1420 are made integrally, which could be made of same
   or different materials during the process of extrusion molding to meet different
10 requirements. However, each of the shielding members 1482 and the corresponding slat
   1420 could be independent components which are combined through gluing, stitching, or
   in other ways.
        [00169]    To prevent light leakages caused by the gap between the slats and the
   headrail and the through holes on the slats themselves, the aforementioned embodiments
15 respectively disclose light blocking systems with different designs. However, it needs to
   be clarified that, the number of the cover plate, and the ways of engaging the cover plates
   and the headrail should not be limitations of the present invention. Besides of the cover
   plates which are made of a rigid material and are integrally made with the headrail, other
   types of pivotable cover plates should be able to pivot relative to the headrail. In addition,
20 a restriction mechanism could be further provided between the control mechanism and the
   cover plate, whereby to position the cover plate at a required position. In this way, the
   cover plate could be no longer moved along with the control mechanism when the
   covering assembly is in the fully open state, but could be still synchronously moved along
   with the control mechanism when the covering assembly is changing back to the closed
25 state or the another closed state.

    [00170]    It must be pointed out that the embodiments described above are only some
preferred embodiments of the present invention. All equivalent structures which employ
the concepts disclosed in this specification and the appended claims should fall within the
scope of the present invention.
