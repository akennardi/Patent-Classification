                                              Abstract
  The present invention provides the use of a composition comprising a polyalkyleneimine and/or
  salts or derivative thereof and an amphoteric polymer for the prevention of corrosion of non
  metallic in organic items during a washing or rinsing process, in particular during an automatic
5 dishwashing process.

                                IMPROVED COMPOSITION
   Technical Field
 5 The present invention relates to an improved composition for use in the protection
   of non-metallic inorganic materials such as glassware in an automatic ware wash
   ing machine, preferably a dishwashing process.
   Background
10
   The problem of corrosion of non-metallic inorganic items, such as glassware, ce
   ramic and enamel materials, when subjected to automatic dishwashing processes
   is well recognised in the art. For example, it has been proposed that the problem
   of glassware corrosion is the result of two separate phenomena.        Firstly, it has
15 been suggested that the corrosion is due to leakage of minerals from the glass
   network, accompanied by hydrolysis of the silicate network. Secondly, it is pro
   posed that the silicate material is then released from the glass.
   These phenomena can cause damage to glassware after a number of separate
20 wash cycles. The damage may include cloudiness, scratches, streaks and other
   discoloration / detrimental effects.
   Silicate materials have been proposed as agents that are effective in preventing
   materials from being released by the glass composition. However, the use of sili
25 cate compounds can have detrimental side effects, such as the tendency to in
   crease separation of silicate material at the glass surface.
   A further solution has been to use metals such as zinc, either in metallic form (such
   as described in US Patent No. 3,677,820) or in the form of compounds. The use of
30 soluble zinc compounds in the prevention of glassware corrosion in a dishwasher
   is described in, for example, US Patent No. 3,255,117.

                                              2
   European Patents; EP-A-0 383 480, EP-A-0 383 482 and EP-A-0 387 997) de
   scribe the use of water insoluble compounds including zinc silicate, zinc carbonate,
   basic zinc carbonate (Zn 2(OH) 2CO 3 ), zinc hydroxide, zinc oxalate, zinc monophos
   phate (Zns(PO4) 2 ) and zinc pyrophosphate (Zn2 P2O7 ) for this purpose.
 5
   Bismuth has been used as an additive to aid the prevention of corrosion of glazed
   glassware corrosion.     For example, BE 860180 describes the use of bismuth to
   avoid damage of decorated, glazed articles.
10 The value of bismuth in this purpose has been diminished by the detrimental ef
   fects that the use of bismuth compound has on other components of the washing
   process or detergent composition.     In soluble bismuth compounds can cause the
   formation of stains on kitchenware items e.g. glassware and cutlery which come
   into contact with these compounds. For these reasons the use of bismuth alone as
15 a glaze protector has been avoided, although a combination of zinc and bismuth
   has been found to address this issue (see WO-A-04/106476).
   However, it has been found that the use of heavy metal compounds in some cir
   cumstances reduce the bleaching performance of a dishwashing composition on
20 bleachable stains such as tea stains. Furthermore, for environmental reasons, it is
   becoming increasingly desirable to limit (and especially to avoid) the use of heavy
   metals in detergent formulations.
   W02010/020765 proposed a solution to this problem of glass and tableware ero
25 sion that did not require the use of heavy metals. This document, which is hereby
   incorporated by reference, disclosed that polyalkyleneimines were highly effective
   additives for the prevention of corrosion of non-metallic inorganic items in auto
   matic washing machines.

                                               3
   However, further to this, it has since been found that while the polyalkyleneimines
   do improve the corrosion protection their use has unexpectedly been found to
   cause poor rinse performance. This leads to unattractive spotting on glassware.
 5 It is the object of the present invention to overcome the poor rinse performance
   that accompanies the use of polyalkyleneimine formulations.
   Statement of invention
10 In a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a composition comprising
   a polyalkyleneimine and at least one amphoteric polymer.
   According to one embodiment, the polyalkyleneimine preferably comprises a poly
   ethyleneimine and most preferably it is polyethyleneimine.
15
   According to one embodiment the number average molecular weight of the polyal
   kyleneimine and/or salt or derivative thereof is in the range of from 100 to
   5,000,000.
20 According to one embodiment the at least one amphoteric polymer is a hydrophilic
   polymer.
   According to another embodiment the at least one amphoteric polymer is an aque
   ous based acrylic acid amine-functional polymer.
25
   According to another embodiment the at least one amphoteric polymer is a quater
   nized ammonium acryl amide acrylic acid copolymer.
   According to another embodiment the at least one amphoteric polymer is produced
30 by Rhodia and sold under the trade name Mirapol Surf S P-free powder.

                                             4
   According to one embodiment of the present invention the composition used is an
   automatic dishwashing composition comprising the polyalkyleneimine and/or salt or
   derivative thereof in an amount of from 0.0001 wt% to 50 wt% of the composition.
 5 According to another embodiment the composition used is an automatic dishwash
   ing rinse aid comprising the polyalkyleneimine and/or salt or derivative thereof in
   an amount of from 0.0005 wt% to 70 wt% of the composition.
   According to yet another embodiment the composition used is a water softening
10 salt composition comprising the polyalkyleneimine and/or salt or derivative thereof
   in an amount of from 0.0001wt% to 90wt% of the composition.
   Detailed description of the invention
15  It has been found that the rinse problems of the compositions caused by the pres
   ence of the polyalkyleneimines can be ameliorated by the addition of an ampho
   teric polymer.
   Any amphoteric polymer may be used to achieve this effect. Preferably the ampho
20 teric polymer is a hydrophilic polymer.
   The protection of the non-metallic inorganic items, such as glassware, ceramic and
   enamel as demonstrated in W02010/020765 is unaffected by the addition of the
   amphoteric polymer, to the polyalkyleneimine containing detergent formulation.
25
   Preferably the amphoteric polymers suitable for use in combination with the polyal
   kyleneimine preferably include at least (1) an acidic monomer having or capable of
   forming an anionic charge and (2) a monomer having a permanent cationic charge
   or is capable of forming a cationic charge upon protonation.
30

                                              5
   Further, the polymer is preferably an aqueous based acrylic acid amine-functional
   polymer. An example of such a polymer is a quaternized ammonium acryl amide
   acrylic acid copolymer. Hydrophilic polymers suitable for inclusion in the composi
   tion of the invention are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,569,261, 6,593,288,
 5 6,703,358 and 6,767,410, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by ref
   erence.
   These patent documents describe water-soluble or water-dispersible copolymers
   including, in the form of polymerized units (1), at least one amine-functional
io monomer (2), at least one hydrophilic monomer with an acidic nature and option
   ally at least one hydrophilic monomer with ethylenic unsaturation and with a neutral
   charge (3). The copolymers include quaternized ammonium acryl amide acid co
   polymers. It will be appreciated that selection of appropriate relevant materials and
   structures as to the polymer should be guided in more detail by the teachings of
15 these patent documents. A preferred copolymer of the above type is produced by
   Rhodia and sold under the trade name MIRAPOL SURF S, in particular that sold
   under the trade name MIRAPOL SURF S P-free powder.
   The amphoteric polymer is preferably used in a washing or rinsing cycle in an
20 automatic dishwasher in an amount of from 0.01mg up to 1Og, more preferably
   from 0.05mg up to 5g, more preferably from 0.1mg up to 1g and most preferably
   from 0.5mg up to 100mg per wash or rinse cycle.
    It is also possible to use the amphoteric polymer in both the wash and the rinse cy
25 cles of an automatic dishwashing machine.
   The compositions of the present invention may include the amphoteric polymer
   from 0.001 and 90 wt %, preferably from 0.005 to 50 wt%, more preferably from
   0.01 to 10% by weight.
30

                                             6
   The term polyalkyleneimine as used herein encompasses any alkyleneimine com
   prising 2 or more alkyleneimine repeating units, and thus alkyleneimine oligomers,
   such as ethyleneimine oligomers are included within the term. Typically the polyal
   kyleneimine will comprise from 2 to 50,000 alkyleneimine repeating units, prefera
 5 bly 10 to 25,000, such as 50 to 10,0000.
   Unless otherwise stated or required by the context, all percentages herein are
   given as weight percentages based on the total weight of the composition. Refer
   ence herein to "polyalkyleneimine(s)" includes reference to the salts and/or deriva
10 tives thereof. References to "amphoteric polymer(s)" includes reference to the salts
   and/or derivatives thereof.
   The polyalkyleneimine and/or salts or derivatives thereof is used in an effective
   amount to provide the aforementioned corrosion protection effects during a wash
15 ing or rinsing cycle. The polyalkyleneimine is preferably used in a washing or rins
   ing cycle in an automatic dishwasher in an amount of from 0.01mg up to 1Og more,
   preferably from 0.05mg up to Sg, more preferably from 0.1mg up to 1g and most
   preferably from 0.5mg up to 100mg per wash or rinse cycle. It is also possible to
   use the polyalkyleneimine in both the wash and the rinse cycles of an automatic
20 dishwashing machine.
   Most preferably the polyalkyleneimine and amphoteric polymer are part of a deter
   gent or rinse formulation. The detergent formulation may be any common deter
   gent formulation of the type usually employed with automatic dishwashers. The
25 formulation may comprise a liquid, gel, powder or tablet formulation which can be
   at least partially packed or filled into a water soluble pouch. Similarly a coating
   may be used to coat at least a portion of the formulation. The mono-dose detergent
   formulation may be sub-divided with different portions separated from each other.
30 Where the formulation is a liquid/gel generally the polyalkyleneimine and ampho
   teric polymer are present in solution within the liquid/ gel. However, it is also con-

                                            7
   templated to have the polyalkyleneimine and/or amphoteric polymer present in the
   liquid/gel in the form of an insoluble solid salt/compound so that the polyalkyle
   neimine and/or amphoteric polymer may comprise a suspended particle (e.g. such
   as a "speckle" typically found in these formulations). For compositions having a
 5 water soluble coating or pouch it is contemplated to have the polyalkyleneimine
   and/or amphoteric polymer as part of the coating/pouch composition.
   The detergent formulation normally comprises other components which are typi
   cally found in dishwasher detergent formulations. In this regard the detergent for
10 mulation typically comprises one or more components selected from the group
   comprising surfactants (non-ionic, anionic, cationic and zwitterionic), builders, en
   zymes, foam suppressants, bleaches, bleach activators, thickeners, perfumes,
   dyes, corrosion inhibitors.
15 The polyalkyleneimine and amphoteric polymer may be present in an automatic
   dishwasher (ADW) detergent composition. In this case the polyalkyleneimine pref
   erably comprises from 0.0001 %wt-50%wt of the detergent composition, more pref
   erably from 0.0005%wt-5%wt and most preferably 0.001%wt-1%wt of the dish
   washer detergent composition (e.g. 10mg for a 20g tablet).
20
   The ADW detergent composition may have a pH from 6-12. The detergent compo
   sition may be neutral with a pH from 6-8 or an alkaline formulation with a pH from
   8-12, preferably between 9 and 11.
25 The ADW detergent composition may be phosphate free.
   The polyalkyleneimine and amphoteric polymer may be also be included in a rinse
   aid composition. In this case the rinse aid composition preferably comprises from
   0.0005%wt-70%wt of the polyalkyleneimine, more preferably from 0.001 %wt
30 50%wt and most preferably 0.005%wt-25%wt, such as from 0.01 %wt-5%wt of the
   rinse aid composition. The rinse aid composition preferably comprises from

                                           8
   0.0005%wt-70%wt of the amphoteric polymer, more preferably from 0.001%wt
   50%wt and most preferably 0.005%wt-25%wt, such as from 0.01 %wt-5%wt of the
   rinse aid composition.
 5 The rinse aid composition may be acidic and may comprise citric acid.
   The polyalkyleneimine and amphoteric polymer may be also be included in a water
   softening salt composition. These are commonly used for the regeneration of the
   ion exchanger present in an automatic dishwasher. In this case the water soften
10 ing salt composition preferably comprises from 0.0001 %wt-90%wt of the water sof
   tening salt composition, more preferably 0.001 %wt-50%wt and most preferably
   0.005%wt-25%wt such as 0.01 to 10%wt of the water softening salt composition.
   The polyalkyleneimine and amphoteric polymer may be included in a machine
15 cleaner/machine additive composition.    In either of these cases the composition
   comprises from 0.0001%wt-90%wt of the amphoteric polymer, more preferably
   from 0.0005%wt-50%wt of the amphoteric polymer and most preferably 0.001 %wt
    10%wt of the amphoteric polymer. The composition also comprises from from
   0.0001%wt-90%wt of the polyalkyleneimine, more preferably from 0.0005%wt
20 50%wt of the polyalkyleneimine and most preferably 0.001%wt-10%wt of the
   polyalkyleneimine.
   Polyalkyleneimines are commercially available from different suppliers under vari
   ous trade names e.g. Lugalvan TM P (ex BASF) and LupasolTM BASF. Polyalkyle
25 neimines are known to have a very widespread range of average molecular
   weights, from around 100 up to several million, preferably in the range of from
   about 100 to about 5,000,000 most preferably of from about 250 to 1,000,000,
   such as from about 400 to about 100,000. The alkylene group, which is preferably
   a linear or branched chain, may also for example be cyclic. The alkylene group
30 preferably has from I to 50 C atoms, more preferably from 2 to 20, such as from 2
   to 5, such as ethylene. These polymers can be linear, branched or end capped.

                                               9
   Suitable end-caps include alkylenediamines such as C2-Cs alkylenediamines e.g.
   ethylenediamines. The polymers may be derivatized e.g. by alkoxylation, ethoxyla
   tion, propoxylation protonated, and be provided with or without a counter-ion.
 5 If a counter ion is present any suitable counter-ion may be used.
   If a counter-ion is used which is known to have negative effects in the dishwashing
   process. e.g. chloride, the chloride counter-ion is preferably present in the dish
   washing process at a concentration of less than 200 mg/litre of dishwashing liquor,
io more preferably at less than 100 mg/litre most preferably less than 50 mg/litre in
   order to avoid rusting, pitting or other types of corrosion on stainless steel e.g. cut
   lery.
   Common commercially available polyalkyleneimines are usually available as an
15 admixture mixture of one or more of the above species. A solvent such as water
   may be present. Any one of these species would be suitable for use in the present
   invention.
   The invention is demonstrated by the following non-limiting example.
