                                         TECHNICAL FIELD
[0003]          This relates generally to electronic devices for making payment transactions,
including but not limited to electronic devices for use with contactless payment systems and
payments over the Internet.
                                            BACKGROUND
[0005]          The use of electronic devices for making payments at point-of-sale terminals and
over the Internet has increased significantly in recent years. Exemplary point-of-sale terminals
include Near Field Communication-enabled (NFC-enabled) terminals, bluetooth-enabled terminals,
and barcode scanner-enabled terminals. Electronic devices can be used in conjunction with these
exemplary terminals to enable the user of the electronic device to make a payment for the purchase
of, for example, a good or service. Similarly, electronic devices can be used in conjunction with
Internet shopping carts to enable the user to make a payment by entering their credit card
information.
                                               SUMMARY
[0005]          Some techniques for making payments using electronic devices, however, are
generally cumbersome and inefficient. For example, making a purchase using an NFC-enabled
device at a point-of-sale terminal frequently requires navigating a complex and time-consuming
user interface. For another example, a user wanting to make a purchase through a website or
mobile application of a retailer may need to manually enter a credit card number and shipping
address information for making the purchase, an inefficient and cumbersome procedure. For
                                                    2

    WO 2015/184353                                                            PCT/US2015/033326
another example, making a purchase using an NFC-enabled device at a point-of-sale terminal
frequently requires navigating a complex and time-consuming user interface to select the
payment account that should be charged. For another example, users who purchase a real-world
good or service are frequently not notified of a digital item and/or do not have convenient access
to a digital item, such as software, that corresponds to the purchased item. For another example,
making a payment requires navigating a complex and time-consuming user interface to select the
recipients of the payment. For another example, navigating a user interface to make a purchase
from a retailer is using the retailer's application is inefficient. For another example, accessing
various applications and navigating their complex user interface to make a repeat or related
purchase of a product is inefficient. In addition, existing techniques take longer than necessary,
thereby wasting energy. This latter consideration is particularly important in battery-operated
devices.
[0006]           Accordingly, there is a need for electronic devices with faster, more efficient
methods and interfaces for making payment transactions. Such methods and interfaces
optionally complement or replace conventional methods for making payments. Such methods
and interfaces reduce the cognitive burden on a user and produce a more efficient human
machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, such methods and interfaces
conserve power and increase the time between battery charges.
[0007]           The above deficiencies and other problems associated with user interfaces for
computing devices for making payment transactions are reduced or eliminated by the disclosed
devices. In some embodiments, the device is a desktop computer. In some embodiments, the
device is portable (e.g., a notebook computer, tablet computer, or handheld device). In some
embodiments, the device has a touchpad. In some embodiments, the device has a touch-sensitive
display (also known as a "touch screen" or "touch screen display"). In some embodiments, the
device has a short-range communication radio. In some embodiments, the device has a graphical
user interface (GUI), one or more processors, memory and one or more modules, programs or
sets of instructions stored in the memory for performing multiple functions. In some
embodiments, the user interacts with the GUI primarily through finger contacts and gestures on
the touch-sensitive surface. Executable instructions for performing functions may be included in
a computer readable storage medium or other computer program product configured for
execution by one or more processors.

                              DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0044]          The following description sets forth exemplary methods, parameters, and the like.
It should be recognized, however, that such description is not intended as a limitation on the
scope of the present disclosure but is instead provided as a description of exemplary
embodiments.
[0045]          There is a need for electronic devices with faster, more efficient methods and
interfaces for making payment transactions. Such methods and interfaces optionally
                                                    8

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
complement or replace conventional methods for making payments. Such methods and
interfaces reduce the cognitive burden on a user and produce a more efficient human-machine
interface. For battery-operated computing devices, such methods and interfaces conserve power
and increase the time between battery charges. Further, such techniques can reduce processor
and battery power otherwise wasted on redundant user inputs.
[0046]           Below, FIGS. 1A-IB, 2, 3, and 4A-4B, and 23-31 provide a description of
exemplary devices for performing techniques related to payments. FIGS. 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17,
19, and 21 illustrate exemplary user interfaces for payments. The user interfaces in the figures
are also used to illustrate the processes described below, including the processes in FIGS. 6, 8,
10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22.
[0047]           Although the following description uses terms "first," "second," etc. to describe
various elements, these elements should not be limited by the terms. These terms are only used
to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first touch could be termed a second
touch, and, similarly, a second touch could be termed a first touch, without departing from the
scope of the various described embodiments. The first touch and the second touch are both
touches, but they are not the same touch.
[0048]           The terminology used in the description of the various described embodiments
herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be
limiting. As used in the description of the various described embodiments and the appended
claims, the singular forms "a", "an," and "the" are intended to include the plural forms as well,
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term "and/or"
as used herein refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one or more of the
associated listed items. It will be further understood that the terms "includes," "including,"
"comprises," and/or "comprising," when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated
features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the
presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements,
components, and/or groups thereof.
[0049]           The term "if' may be construed to mean "when" or "upon" or "in response to
determining" or "in response to detecting," depending on the context. Similarly, the phrase "if it
is determined" or "if [a stated condition or event] is detected" may be construed to mean "upon
determining" or "in response to determining" or "upon detecting [the stated condition or event]"
or "in response to detecting [the stated condition or event]," depending on the context.

associated processes for using such devices are described. In some embodiments, the device is a
portable communications device, such as a mobile telephone, that also contains other functions,
such as PDA and/or music player functions. Exemplary embodiments of portable multifunction
devices include, without limitation, the iPhone@, iPod Touch@, and iPad@ devices from Apple
Inc. of Cupertino, California. Other portable electronic devices, such as laptops or tablet
computers with touch-sensitive surfaces (e.g., touch screen displays and/or touchpads), are,
optionally, used. It should also be understood that, in some embodiments, the device is not a
portable communications device, but is a desktop computer with a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a
touch screen display and/or a touchpad).
[0051]          In the discussion that follows, an electronic device that includes a display and a
touch-sensitive surface is described. It should be understood, however, that the electronic device
optionally includes one or more other physical user-interface devices, such as a physical
keyboard, a mouse, and/or a joystick.
[0052]          The device may support a variety of applications, such as one or more of the
following: a drawing application, a presentation application, a word processing application, a
website creation application, a disk authoring application, a spreadsheet application, a gaming
application, a telephone application, a video conferencing application, an e-mail application, an
instant messaging application, a workout support application, a photo management application, a
digital camera application, a digital video camera application, a web browsing application, a
digital music player application, and/or a digital video player application.
[0053]          The various applications that are executed on the device optionally use at least
one common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive surface. One or more
functions of the touch-sensitive surface as well as corresponding information displayed on the
device are, optionally, adjusted and/or varied from one application to the next and/or within a
respective application. In this way, a common physical architecture (such as the touch-sensitive
surface) of the device optionally supports the variety of applications with user interfaces that are
intuitive and transparent to the user.
[0054]          Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable devices with touch
sensitive displays. FIG. 1A is a block diagram illustrating portable multifunction device 100
with touch-sensitive display system 112 in accordance with some embodiments. Touch-sensitive
display 112 is sometimes called a "touch screen" for convenience and is sometimes known as or
called a "touch-sensitive display system." Device 100 includes memory 102 (which optionally
                                                  10

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
includes one or more computer-readable storage mediums), memory controller 122, one or more
processing units (CPUs) 120, peripherals interface 118, RF circuitry 108, audio circuitry 110,
speaker 111, microphone 113, input/output (1/0) subsystem 106, other input control devices 116,
and external port 124. Device 100 optionally includes one or more optical sensors 164. Device
100 optionally includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of
contacts on device 100 (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system 112
of device 100). Device 100 optionally includes one or more tactile output generators 167 for
generating tactile outputs on device 100 (e.g., generating tactile outputs on a touch-sensitive
surface such as touch-sensitive display system 112 of device 100 or touchpad 355 of device
300). These components optionally communicate over one or more communication buses or
signal lines 103.
[0055]          As used in the specification and claims, the term "intensity" of a contact on a
touch-sensitive surface refers to the force or pressure (force per unit area) of a contact (e.g., a
finger contact) on the touch-sensitive surface, or to a substitute (proxy) for the force or pressure
of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface. The intensity of a contact has a range of values that
includes at least four distinct values and more typically includes hundreds of distinct values (e.g.,
at least 256). Intensity of a contact is, optionally, determined (or measured) using various
approaches and various sensors or combinations of sensors. For example, one or more force
sensors underneath or adjacent to the touch-sensitive surface are, optionally, used to measure
force at various points on the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, force
measurements from multiple force sensors are combined (e.g., a weighted average) to determine
an estimated force of a contact. Similarly, a pressure-sensitive tip of a stylus is, optionally, used
to determine a pressure of the stylus on the touch-sensitive surface. Alternatively, the size of the
contact area detected on the touch-sensitive surface and/or changes thereto, the capacitance of
the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto, and/or the resistance
of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto are, optionally,
used as a substitute for the force or pressure of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface. In
some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force or pressure are used
directly to determine whether an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity
threshold is described in units corresponding to the substitute measurements). In some
implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force or pressure are converted to an
estimated force or pressure, and the estimated force or pressure is used to determine whether an
intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is a pressure threshold
measured in units of pressure). Using the intensity of a contact as an attribute of a user input
                                                   11

    WO 2015/184353                                                            PCT/US2015/033326
allows for user access to additional device functionality that may otherwise not be accessible by
the user on a reduced-size device with limited real estate for displaying affordances (e.g., on a
touch-sensitive display) and/or receiving user input (e.g., via a touch-sensitive display, a touch
sensitive surface, or a physical/mechanical control such as a knob or a button).
[0056]           As used in the specification and claims, the term "tactile output" refers to physical
displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device, physical displacement of a
component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device relative to another component (e.g.,
housing) of the device, or displacement of the component relative to a center of mass of the
device that will be detected by a user with the user's sense of touch. For example, in situations
where the device or the component of the device is in contact with a surface of a user that is
sensitive to touch (e.g., a finger, palm, or other part of a user's hand), the tactile output generated
by the physical displacement will be interpreted by the user as a tactile sensation corresponding
to a perceived change in physical characteristics of the device or the component of the device.
For example, movement of a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch-sensitive display or trackpad)
is, optionally, interpreted by the user as a "down click" or "up click" of a physical actuator
button. In some cases, a user will feel a tactile sensation such as an "down click" or "up click"
even when there is no movement of a physical actuator button associated with the touch
sensitive surface that is physically pressed (e.g., displaced) by the user's movements. As another
example, movement of the touch-sensitive surface is, optionally, interpreted or sensed by the
user as "roughness" of the touch-sensitive surface, even when there is no change in smoothness
of the touch-sensitive surface. While such interpretations of touch by a user will be subject to
the individualized sensory perceptions of the user, there are many sensory perceptions of touch
that are common to a large majority of users. Thus, when a tactile output is described as
corresponding to a particular sensory perception of a user (e.g., an "up click," a "down click,"
"roughness"), unless otherwise stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to physical
displacement of the device or a component thereof that will generate the described sensory
perception for a typical (or average) user.
[0057]           It should be appreciated that device 100 is only one example of a portable
multifunction device, and that device 100 optionally has more or fewer components than shown,
optionally combines two or more components, or optionally has a different configuration or
arrangement of the components. The various components shown in FIG. 1A are implemented in
hardware, software, or a combination of both hardware and software, including one or more
signal processing and/or application-specific integrated circuits.

[0058]          Memory 102 may include one or more computer-readable storage mediums. The
computer-readable storage mediums may be tangible and non-transitory. Memory 102 may
include high-speed random access memory and may also include non-volatile memory, such as
one or more magnetic disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid
state memory devices. Memory controller 122 may control access to memory 102 by other
components of device 100.
[0059]          Peripherals interface 118 can be used to couple input and output peripherals of the
device to CPU 120 and memory 102. The one or more processors 120 run or execute various
software programs and/or sets of instructions stored in memory 102 to perform various functions
for device 100 and to process data. In some embodiments, peripherals interface 118, CPU 120,
and memory controller 122 may be implemented on a single chip, such as chip 104. In some
other embodiments, they may be implemented on separate chips.
[0060]          RF (radio frequency) circuitry 108 receives and sends RF signals, also called
electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 converts electrical signals to/from electromagnetic
signals and communicates with communications networks and other communications devices via
the electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 optionally includes well-known circuitry for
performing these functions, including but not limited to an antenna system, an RF transceiver,
one or more amplifiers, a tuner, one or more oscillators, a digital signal processor, a CODEC
chipset, a subscriber identity module (SIM) card, memory, and so forth. RF circuitry 108
optionally communicates with networks, such as the Internet, also referred to as the World Wide
Web (WWW), an intranet and/or a wireless network, such as a cellular telephone network, a
wireless local area network (LAN) and/or a metropolitan area network (MAN), and other devices
by wireless communication. The RF circuitry 108 optionally includes well-known circuitry for
detecting near field communication (NFC) fields, such as by a short-range communication radio.
The wireless communication optionally uses any of a plurality of communications standards,
protocols, and technologies, including but not limited to Global System for Mobile
Communications (GSM), Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE), high-speed downlink
packet access (HSDPA), high-speed uplink packet access (HSUPA), Evolution, Data-Only (EV

filing date of this document.
[0061]           Audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, and microphone 113 provide an audio interface
between a user and device 100. Audio circuitry 110 receives audio data from peripherals
interface 118, converts the audio data to an electrical signal, and transmits the electrical signal to
speaker 111. Speaker 111 converts the electrical signal to human-audible sound waves. Audio
circuitry 110 also receives electrical signals converted by microphone 113 from sound waves.
Audio circuitry 110 converts the electrical signal to audio data and transmits the audio data to
peripherals interface 118 for processing. Audio data may be retrieved from and/or transmitted to
memory 102 and/or RF circuitry 108 by peripherals interface 118. In some embodiments, audio
circuitry 110 also includes a headset jack (e.g., 212, FIG. 2). The headset jack provides an
interface between audio circuitry 110 and removable audio input/output peripherals, such as
output-only headphones or a headset with both output (e.g., a headphone for one or both ears)
and input (e.g., a microphone).
[0062]           1/0 subsystem 106 couples input/output peripherals on device 100, such as touch
screen 112 and other input control devices 116, to peripherals interface 118. 1/0 subsystem 106
optionally includes display controller 156, optical sensor controller 158, intensity sensor
controller 159, haptic feedback controller 161, and one or more input controllers 160 for other
input or control devices. The one or more input controllers 160 receive/send electrical signals
from/to other input control devices 116. The other input control devices 116 optionally include
physical buttons (e.g., push buttons, rocker buttons, etc.), dials, slider switches, joysticks, click
wheels, and so forth. In some alternate embodiments, input controller(s) 160 are, optionally,
coupled to any (or none) of the following: a keyboard, an infrared port, a USB port, and a pointer
device such as a mouse. The one or more buttons (e.g., 208, FIG. 2) optionally include an
up/down button for volume control of speaker 111 and/or microphone 113. The one or more
buttons optionally include a push button (e.g., 206, FIG. 2).
[0063]           A quick press of the push button may disengage a lock of touch screen 112 or
begin a process that uses gestures on the touch screen to unlock the device, as described in U.S.

Touch screen 112 is used to implement virtual or soft buttons and one or more soft keyboards.
[0064]          Touch-sensitive display 112 provides an input interface and an output interface
between the device and a user. Display controller 156 receives and/or sends electrical signals
from/to touch screen 112. Touch screen 112 displays visual output to the user. The visual
output may include graphics, text, icons, video, and any combination thereof (collectively termed
"graphics"). In some embodiments, some or all of the visual output may correspond to user
interface objects.
[0065]          Touch screen 112 has a touch-sensitive surface, sensor, or set of sensors that
accepts input from the user based on haptic and/or tactile contact. Touch screen 112 and display
controller 156 (along with any associated modules and/or sets of instructions in memory 102)
detect contact (and any movement or breaking of the contact) on touch screen 112 and convert
the detected contact into interaction with user-interface objects (e.g., one or more soft keys,
icons, web pages, or images) that are displayed on touch screen 112. In an exemplary
embodiment, a point of contact between touch screen 112 and the user corresponds to a finger of
the user.
[0066]          Touch screen 112 may use LCD (liquid crystal display) technology, LPD (light
emitting polymer display) technology, or LED (light emitting diode) technology, although other
display technologies may be used in other embodiments. Touch screen 112 and display
controller 156 may detect contact and any movement or breaking thereof using any of a plurality
of touch sensing technologies now known or later developed, including but not limited to
capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic wave technologies, as well as other proximity
sensor arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of contact with touch screen
 112. In an exemplary embodiment, projected mutual capacitance sensing technology is used,
such as that found in the iPhone@ and iPod Touch@ from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California.
[0067]          A touch-sensitive display in some embodiments of touch screen 112 may be
analogous to the multi-touch sensitive touchpads described in the following U.S. Patents:
6,323,846 (Westerman et al.), 6,570,557 (Westerman et al.), and/or 6,677,932 (Westerman),
and/or U.S. Patent Publication 2002/0015024A1, each of which is hereby incorporated by
reference in its entirety. However, touch screen 112 displays visual output from device 100,
whereas touch-sensitive touchpads do not provide visual output.

of these applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.
[0069]           Touch screen 112 may have a video resolution in excess of 100 dpi. In some
embodiments, the touch screen has a video resolution of approximately 160 dpi. The user may
make contact with touch screen 112 using any suitable object or appendage, such as a stylus, a
finger, and so forth. In some embodiments, the user interface is designed to work primarily with
finger-based contacts and gestures, which can be less precise than stylus-based input due to the
larger area of contact of a finger on the touch screen. In some embodiments, the device
translates the rough finger-based input into a precise pointer/cursor position or command for
performing the actions desired by the user.
[0070]           In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, device 100 may include a
touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular functions. In some embodiments,
the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device that, unlike the touch screen, does not display
visual output. The touchpad may be a touch-sensitive surface that is separate from touch screen
112 or an extension of the touch-sensitive surface formed by the touch screen.
[0071]           Device 100 also includes power system 162 for powering the various
components. Power system 162 may include a power management system, one or more power
sources (e.g., battery, alternating current (AC)), a recharging system, a power failure detection
circuit, a power converter or inverter, a power status indicator (e.g., a light-emitting diode
(LED)) and any other components associated with the generation, management and distribution
of power in portable devices.
[0072]           Device 100 may also include one or more optical sensors 164. FIG. 1A shows an
optical sensor coupled to optical sensor controller 158 in 1/0 subsystem 106. Optical sensor 164

may include charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide semiconductor
(CMOS) phototransistors. Optical sensor 164 receives light from the environment, projected
through one or more lenses, and converts the light to data representing an image. In conjunction
with imaging module 143 (also called a camera module), optical sensor 164 may capture still
images or video. In some embodiments, an optical sensor is located on the back of device 100,
opposite touch screen display 112 on the front of the device so that the touch screen display may
be used as a viewfinder for still and/or video image acquisition. In some embodiments, an
optical sensor is located on the front of the device so that the user's image may be obtained for
video conferencing while the user views the other video conference participants on the touch
screen display. In some embodiments, the position of optical sensor 164 can be changed by the
user (e.g., by rotating the lens and the sensor in the device housing) so that a single optical sensor
 164 may be used along with the touch screen display for both video conferencing and still and/or
video image acquisition.
[0073]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165.
FIG. 1A shows a contact intensity sensor coupled to intensity sensor controller 159 in 1/0
subsystem 106. Contact intensity sensor 165 optionally includes one or more piezoresistive
strain gauges, capacitive force sensors, electric force sensors, piezoelectric force sensors, optical
force sensors, capacitive touch-sensitive surfaces, or other intensity sensors (e.g., sensors used to
measure the force (or pressure) of a contact on a touch-sensitive surface). Contact intensity
sensor 165 receives contact intensity information (e.g., pressure information or a proxy for
pressure information) from the environment. In some embodiments, at least one contact
intensity sensor is collocated with, or proximate to, a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch
sensitive display system 112). In some embodiments, at least one contact intensity sensor is
located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112, which is located on the
front of device 100.
[0074]           Device 100 may also include one or more proximity sensors 166. FIG. 1A shows
proximity sensor 166 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately, proximity sensor 166
may be coupled to input controller 160 in 1/0 subsystem 106. Proximity sensor 166 may
perform as described in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 11/241,839, "Proximity Detector In
Handheld Device"; 11/240,788, "Proximity Detector In Handheld Device"; 11/620,702, "Using
Ambient Light Sensor To Augment Proximity Sensor Output"; 11/586,862, "Automated
Response To And Sensing Of User Activity In Portable Devices"; and 11/638,251, "Methods
And Systems For Automatic Configuration Of Peripherals," which are hereby incorporated by

is making a phone call).
[0075]            Device 100 optionally also includes one or more tactile output generators 167.
FIG. 1A shows a tactile output generator coupled to haptic feedback controller 161 in 1/0
subsystem 106. Tactile output generator 167 optionally includes one or more electroacoustic
devices such as speakers or other audio components and/or electromechanical devices that
convert energy into linear motion such as a motor, solenoid, electroactive polymer, piezoelectric
actuator, electrostatic actuator, or other tactile output generating component (e.g., a component
that converts electrical signals into tactile outputs on the device). Contact intensity sensor 165
receives tactile feedback generation instructions from haptic feedback module 133 and generates
tactile outputs on device 100 that are capable of being sensed by a user of device 100. In some
embodiments, at least one tactile output generator is collocated with, or proximate to, a touch
sensitive surface (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112) and, optionally, generates a tactile
output by moving the touch-sensitive surface vertically (e.g., in/out of a surface of device 100) or
laterally (e.g., back and forth in the same plane as a surface of device 100). In some
embodiments, at least one tactile output generator sensor is located on the back of device 100,
opposite touch screen display 112, which is located on the front of device 100.
[0076]            Device 100 may also include one or more accelerometers 168. FIG. 1A shows
accelerometer 168 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately, accelerometer 168 may be
coupled to an input controller 160 in 1/0 subsystem 106. Accelerometer 168 may perform as
described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050190059, "Acceleration-based Theft Detection
System for Portable Electronic Devices," and U.S. Patent Publication No. 20060017692,
"Methods And Apparatuses For Operating A Portable Device Based On An Accelerometer,"
both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In some embodiments,

embodiments, memory 102 (FIG. 1A) or 370 (FIG. 3) stores device/global internal state 157, as
shown in FIGS. 1A and 3. Device/global internal state 157 includes one or more of: active
application state, indicating which applications, if any, are currently active; display state,
indicating what applications, views or other information occupy various regions of touch screen
display 112; sensor state, including information obtained from the device's various sensors and
input control devices 116; and location information concerning the device's location and/or
attitude.
[0078]          Operating system 126 (e.g., Darwin, RTXC, LINUX, UNIX, OS X, iOS,
WINDOWS, or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks) includes various software
components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks (e.g., memory
management, storage device control, power management, etc.) and facilitates communication
between various hardware and software components.
[0079]          Communication module 128 facilitates communication with other devices over
one or more external ports 124 and also includes various software components for handling data
received by RF circuitry 108 and/or external port 124. External port 124 (e.g., Universal Serial
Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to other devices or indirectly over
a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.). In some embodiments, the external port is a
multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as, or similar to and/or compatible with, the
30-pin connector used on iPod@ (trademark of Apple Inc.) devices.
[0080]          Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects contact with touch screen 112 (in
conjunction with display controller 156) and other touch-sensitive devices (e.g., a touchpad or
physical click wheel). Contact/motion module 130 includes various software components for
performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as determining if contact has
occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining an intensity of the contact (e.g., the
force or pressure of the contact or a substitute for the force or pressure of the contact),
determining if there is movement of the contact and tracking the movement across the touch
sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more finger-dragging events), and determining if the
contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a finger-up event or a break in contact). Contact/motion
module 130 receives contact data from the touch-sensitive surface. Determining movement of
the point of contact, which is represented by a series of contact data, optionally includes
determining speed (magnitude), velocity (magnitude and direction), and/or an acceleration (a
change in magnitude and/or direction) of the point of contact. These operations are, optionally,
applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger contacts) or to multiple simultaneous contacts (e.g.,
                                                   19

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
"multitouch"/multiple finger contacts). In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 and
display controller 156 detect contact on a touchpad.
[0081]           In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 uses a set of one or more
intensity thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user (e.g., to
determine whether a user has "clicked" on an icon). In some embodiments, at least a subset of
the intensity thresholds are determined in accordance with software parameters (e.g., the
intensity thresholds are not determined by the activation thresholds of particular physical
actuators and can be adjusted without changing the physical hardware of device 100). For
example, a mouse "click" threshold of a trackpad or touch screen display can be set to any of a
large range of predefined threshold values without changing the trackpad or touch screen display
hardware. Additionally, in some implementations, a user of the device is provided with software
settings for adjusting one or more of the set of intensity thresholds (e.g., by adjusting individual
intensity thresholds and/or by adjusting a plurality of intensity thresholds at once with a system
level click "intensity" parameter).
[0082]           Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects a gesture input by a user. Different
gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns (e.g., different motions,
timings, and/or intensities of detected contacts). Thus, a gesture is, optionally, detected by
detecting a particular contact pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap gesture includes
detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up (liftoff) event at the same
position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g., at the position of an
icon). As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the touch-sensitive surface
includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or more finger-dragging
events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up (liftoff) event.
[0083]           Graphics module 132 includes various known software components for rendering
and displaying graphics on touch screen 112 or other display, including components for
changing the visual impact (e.g., brightness, transparency, saturation, contrast, or other visual
property) of graphics that are displayed. As used herein, the term "graphics" includes any object
that can be displayed to a user, including ,without limitation, text, web pages, icons (such as
user-interface objects including soft keys), digital images, videos, animations, and the like.
[0084]           In some embodiments, graphics module 132 stores data representing graphics to
be used. Each graphic is, optionally, assigned a corresponding code. Graphics module 132
receives, from applications etc., one or more codes specifying graphics to be displayed along

provides soft keyboards for entering text in various applications (e.g., contacts 137, e-mail 140,
IM 141, browser 147, and any other application that needs text input).
[0087]           GPS module 135 determines the location of the device and provides this
information for use in various applications (e.g., to telephone 138 for use in location-based
dialing; to camera 143 as picture/video metadata; and to applications that provide location-based
services such as weather widgets, local yellow page widgets, and map/navigation widgets).

[0107]           Each of the above-identified modules and applications corresponds to a set of
executable instructions for performing one or more functions described above and the methods
described in this application (e.g., the computer-implemented methods and other information
processing methods described herein). These modules (e.g., sets of instructions) need not be
implemented as separate software programs, procedures, or modules, and thus various subsets of
these modules may be combined or otherwise rearranged in various embodiments. For example,
video player module may be combined with music player module into a single module (e.g.,
video and music player module 152, FIG. 1A). In some embodiments, memory 102 may store a
subset of the modules and data structures identified above. Furthermore, memory 102 may store
additional modules and data structures not described above.
[0108]           In some embodiments, device 100 is a device where operation of a predefined set
of functions on the device is performed exclusively through a touch screen and/or a touchpad.
By using a touch screen and/or a touchpad as the primary input control device for operation of
device 100, the number of physical input control devices (such as push buttons, dials, and the
like) on device 100 may be reduced.
[0109]           The predefined set of functions that are performed exclusively through a touch
screen and/or a touchpad optionally include navigation between user interfaces. In some
embodiments, the touchpad, when touched by the user, navigates device 100 to a main, home, or
root menu from any user interface that is displayed on device 100. In such embodiments, a
"menu button" is implemented using a touchpad. In some other embodiments, the menu button
is a physical push button or other physical input control device instead of a touchpad.
[0110]           FIG. lB is a block diagram illustrating exemplary components for event handling
in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102 (FIG. 1A) or 370
(FIG. 3) includes event sorter 170 (e.g., in operating system 126) and a respective application
 136-1 (e.g., any of the aforementioned applications 137-151, 155, 380-390).
[0111]           Event sorter 170 receives event information and determines the application 136-1
and application view 191 of application 136-1 to which to deliver the event information. Event
sorter 170 includes event monitor 171 and event dispatcher module 174. In some embodiments,
application 136-1 includes application internal state 192, which indicates the current application
view(s) displayed on touch-sensitive display 112 when the application is active or executing. In
some embodiments, device/global internal state 157 is used by event sorter 170 to determine
which application(s) is (are) currently active, and application internal state 192 is used by event
sorter 170 to determine application views 191 to which to deliver event information.

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
[0112]           In some embodiments, application internal state 192 includes additional
information, such as one or more of: resume information to be used when application 136-1
resumes execution, user interface state information that indicates information being displayed or
that is ready for display by application 136-1, a state queue for enabling the user to go back to a
prior state or view of application 136-1, and a redo/undo queue of previous actions taken by the
user.
[0113]           Event monitor 171 receives event information from peripherals interface 118.
Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on touch-sensitive
display 112, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface 118 transmits information it
receives from I/O subsystem 106 or a sensor, such as proximity sensor 166, accelerometer(s)
 168, and/or microphone 113 (through audio circuitry 110). Information that peripherals interface
 118 receives from I/O subsystem 106 includes information from touch-sensitive display 112 or a
touch-sensitive surface.
[0114]           In some embodiments, event monitor 171 sends requests to the peripherals
interface 118 at predetermined intervals. In response, peripherals interface 118 transmits event
information. In other embodiments, peripherals interface 118 transmits event information only
when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving an input above a predetermined noise threshold
and/or for more than a predetermined duration).
[0115]           In some embodiments, event sorter 170 also includes a hit view determination
module 172 and/or an active event recognizer determination module 173.
[0116]           Hit view determination module 172 provides software procedures for determining
where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views when touch-sensitive display 112
displays more than one view. Views are made up of controls and other elements that a user can
see on the display.
[0117]           Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set of
views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which
information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a respective
application) in which a touch is detected may correspond to programmatic levels within a
programmatic or view hierarchy of the application. For example, the lowest level view in which
a touch is detected may be called the hit view, and the set of events that are recognized as proper
inputs may be determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the initial touch that begins a
touch-based gesture.
                                                  27

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
[0118]          Hit view determination module 172 receives information related to sub-events of
a touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized in a hierarchy, hit
view determination module 172 identifies a hit view as the lowest view in the hierarchy which
should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view is the lowest level view in
which an initiating sub-event occurs (e.g., the first sub-event in the sequence of sub-events that
form an event or potential event). Once the hit view is identified by the hit view determination
module 172, the hit view typically receives all sub-events related to the same touch or input
source for which it was identified as the hit view.
[0119]          Active event recognizer determination module 173 determines which view or
views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In some
embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that only the hit
view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, active event
recognizer determination module 173 determines that all views that include the physical location
of a sub-event are actively involved views, and therefore determines that all actively involved
views should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, even if touch
sub-events were entirely confined to the area associated with one particular view, views higher in
the hierarchy would still remain as actively involved views.
[0120]          Event dispatcher module 174 dispatches the event information to an event
recognizer (e.g., event recognizer 180). In embodiments including active event recognizer
determination module 173, event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to an
event recognizer determined by active event recognizer determination module 173. In some
embodiments, event dispatcher module 174 stores in an event queue the event information,
which is retrieved by a respective event receiver 182.
[0121]          In some embodiments, operating system 126 includes event sorter 170.
Alternatively, application 136-1 includes event sorter 170. In yet other embodiments, event
sorter 170 is a stand-alone module, or a part of another module stored in memory 102, such as
contact/motion module 130.
[0122]          In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes a plurality of event handlers
 190 and one or more application views 191, each of which includes instructions for handling
touch events that occur within a respective view of the application's user interface. Each
application view 191 of the application 136-1 includes one or more event recognizers 180.
Typically, a respective application view 191 includes a plurality of event recognizers 180. In
other embodiments, one or more of event recognizers 180 are part of a separate module, such as
                                                  28

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
a user interface kit (not shown) or a higher level object from which application 136-1 inherits
methods and other properties. In some embodiments, a respective event handler 190 includes
one or more of: data updater 176, object updater 177, GUI updater 178, and/or event data 179
received from event sorter 170. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176, object
updater 177, or GUI updater 178 to update the application internal state 192. Alternatively, one
or more of the application views 191 include one or more respective event handlers 190. Also,
in some embodiments, one or more of data updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater
 178 are included in a respective application view 191.
[0123]           A respective event recognizer 180 receives event information (e.g., event data
 179) from event sorter 170 and identifies an event from the event information. Event recognizer
 180 includes event receiver 182 and event comparator 184. In some embodiments, event
recognizer 180 also includes at least a subset of: metadata 183, and event delivery instructions
 188 (which may include sub-event delivery instructions).
[0124]           Event receiver 182 receives event information from event sorter 170. The event
information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch movement.
Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional information, such as
location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a touch, the event information
may also include speed and direction of the sub-event. In some embodiments, events include
rotation of the device from one orientation to another (e.g., from a portrait orientation to a
landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the event information includes corresponding
information about the current orientation (also called device attitude) of the device.
[0125]           Event comparator 184 compares the event information to predefined event or sub
event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event, or determines
or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event comparator 184
includes event definitions 186. Event definitions 186 contain definitions of events (e.g.,
predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event 1 (187-1), event 2 (187-2), and others.
In some embodiments, sub-events in an event (187) include, for example, touch begin, touch
end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple touching. In one example, the definition
for event 1 (187-1) is a double tap on a displayed object. The double tap, for example, comprises
a first touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a first liftoff (touch
end) for a predetermined phase, a second touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a
predetermined phase, and a second liftoff (touch end) for a predetermined phase. In another
example, the definition for event 2 (187-2) is a dragging on a displayed object. The dragging,
for example, comprises a touch (or contact) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a
                                                  29

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
movement of the touch across touch-sensitive display 112, and liftoff of the touch (touch end).
In some embodiments, the event also includes information for one or more associated event
handlers 190.
[0126]           In some embodiments, event definition 187 includes a definition of an event for a
respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator 184 performs a hit test
to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event. For example, in an
application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on touch-sensitive display
 112, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display 112, event comparator 184 performs a
hit test to determine which of the three user-interface objects is associated with the touch (sub
event). If each displayed object is associated with a respective event handler 190, the event
comparator uses the result of the hit test to determine which event handler 190 should be
activated. For example, event comparator 184 selects an event handler associated with the sub
event and the object triggering the hit test.
[0127]           In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event (187) also includes
delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been determined
whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event recognizer's event
type.
[0128]           When a respective event recognizer 180 determines that the series of sub-events
do not match any of the events in event definitions 186, the respective event recognizer 180
enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which it disregards
subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other event recognizers, if
any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process sub-events of an ongoing
touch-based gesture.
[0129]           In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 includes metadata 183
with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event delivery system
should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers. In some
embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how
event recognizers may interact, or are enabled to interact, with one another. In some
embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate
whether sub-events are delivered to varying levels in the view or programmatic hierarchy.
[0130]           In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 activates event handler
 190 associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event are recognized.
In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 delivers event information associated
                                                  30

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
with the event to event handler 190. Activating an event handler 190 is distinct from sending
(and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In some embodiments, event
recognizer 180 throws a flag associated with the recognized event, and event handler 190
associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a predefined process.
[0131]          In some embodiments, event delivery instructions 188 include sub-event delivery
instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating an event handler.
Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to event handlers
associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views. Event handlers associated
with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views receive the event information and
perform a predetermined process.
[0132]          In some embodiments, data updater 176 creates and updates data used in
application 136-1. For example, data updater 176 updates the telephone number used in contacts
module 137, or stores a video file used in video player module. In some embodiments, object
updater 177 creates and updates objects used in application 136-1. For example, object updater
 177 creates a new user-interface object or updates the position of a user-interface object. GUI
updater 178 updates the GUI. For example, GUI updater 178 prepares display information and
sends it to graphics module 132 for display on a touch-sensitive display.
[0133]          In some embodiments, event handler(s) 190 includes or has access to data updater
 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178. In some embodiments, data updater 176, object
updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a single module of a respective application
 136-1 or application view 191. In other embodiments, they are included in two or more software
modules.
[0134]          It shall be understood that the foregoing discussion regarding event handling of
user touches on touch-sensitive displays also applies to other forms of user inputs to operate
multifunction devices 100 with input devices, not all of which are initiated on touch screens. For
example, mouse movement and mouse button presses, optionally coordinated with single or
multiple keyboard presses or holds; contact movements such as taps, drags, scrolls, etc. on
touchpads; pen stylus inputs; movement of the device; oral instructions; detected eye
movements; biometric inputs; and/or any combination thereof are optionally utilized as inputs
corresponding to sub-events which define an event to be recognized.
[0135]          FIG. 2 illustrates a portable multifunction device 100 having a touch screen 112
in accordance with some embodiments. The touch screen optionally displays one or more
graphics within user interface (UI) 200. In this embodiment, as well as others described below, a
                                                  31

    WO 2015/184353                                                         PCT/US2015/033326
user is enabled to select one or more of the graphics by making a gesture on the graphics, for
example, with one or more fingers 202 (not drawn to scale in the figure) or one or more styluses
203 (not drawn to scale in the figure). In some embodiments, selection of one or more graphics
occurs when the user breaks contact with the one or more graphics. In some embodiments, the
gesture optionally includes one or more taps, one or more swipes (from left to right, right to left,
upward and/or downward), and/or a rolling of a finger (from right to left, left to right, upward
and/or downward) that has made contact with device 100. In some implementations or
circumstances, inadvertent contact with a graphic does not select the graphic. For example, a
swipe gesture that sweeps over an application icon optionally does not select the corresponding
application when the gesture corresponding to selection is a tap.
[0136]          Device 100 may also include one or more physical buttons, such as "home" or
menu button 204. As described previously, menu button 204 may be used to navigate to any
application 136 in a set of applications that may be executed on device 100. Alternatively, in
some embodiments, the menu button is implemented as a soft key in a GUI displayed on touch
screen 112.
[0137]          In some embodiments, device 100 includes touch screen 112, menu button 204,
push button 206 for powering the device on/off and locking the device, volume adjustment
button(s) 208, subscriber identity module (SIM) card slot 210, headset jack 212, and
docking/charging external port 124. Push button 206 is, optionally, used to turn the power on/off
on the device by depressing the button and holding the button in the depressed state for a
predefined time interval; to lock the device by depressing the button and releasing the button
before the predefined time interval has elapsed; and/or to unlock the device or initiate an unlock
process. In an alternative embodiment, device 100 also accepts verbal input for activation or
deactivation of some functions through microphone 113. Device 100 also, optionally, includes
one or more contact intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of contacts on touch screen 112
and/or one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating tactile outputs for a user of
device 100.
[0138]          FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary multifunction device with a display
and a touch-sensitive surface in accordance with some embodiments. Device 300 need not be
portable. In some embodiments, device 300 is a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet
computer, a multimedia player device, a navigation device, an educational device (such as a
child's learning toy), a gaming system, or a control device (e.g., a home or industrial controller).
Device 300 typically includes one or more processing units (CPUs) 310, one or more network or
other communications interfaces 360, memory 370, and one or more communication buses 320
                                                 32

for interconnecting these components. Communication buses 320 optionally include circuitry
(sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls communications between system
components. Device 300 includes input/output (1/0) interface 330 comprising display 340,
which is typically a touch screen display. 1/0 interface 330 also optionally includes a keyboard
and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 350 and touchpad 355, tactile output generator 357 for
generating tactile outputs on device 300 (e.g., similar to tactile output generator(s) 167 described
above with reference to FIG. 1A), sensors 359 (e.g., optical, acceleration, proximity, touch
sensitive, and/or contact intensity sensors similar to contact intensity sensor(s) 165 described
above with reference to FIG. 1A). Memory 370 includes high-speed random access memory,
such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM, or other random access solid state memory devices; and
optionally includes non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices,
optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage
devices. Memory 370 optionally includes one or more storage devices remotely located from
CPU(s) 310. In some embodiments, memory 370 stores programs, modules, and data structures
analogous to the programs, modules, and data structures stored in memory 102 of portable
multifunction device 100 (FIG. 1A), or a subset thereof. Furthermore, memory 370 optionally
stores additional programs, modules, and data structures not present in memory 102 of portable
multifunction device 100. For example, memory 370 of device 300 optionally stores drawing
module 380, presentation module 382, word processing module 384, website creation module
386, disk authoring module 388, and/or spreadsheet module 390, while memory 102 of portable
multifunction device 100 (FIG. 1A) optionally does not store these modules.
[0139]           Each of the above-identified elements in FIG. 3 may be stored in one or more of
the previously mentioned memory devices. Each of the above-identified modules corresponds to
a set of instructions for performing a function described above. The above-identified modules or
programs (e.g., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs,
procedures ,or modules, and thus various subsets of these modules may be combined or
otherwise rearranged in various embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 370 may store a
subset of the modules and data structures identified above. Furthermore, memory 370 may store
additional modules and data structures not described above.
[0140]           Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces that may be
implemented on, for example, portable multifunction device 100.
[0141]           FIG. 4A illustrates an exemplary user interface for a menu of applications on
portable multifunction device 100 in accordance with some embodiments. Similar user

[0142]          It should be noted that the icon labels illustrated in FIG. 4A are merely
exemplary. For example, icon 422 for video and music player module 152 may optionally be
labeled "Music" or "Music Player." Other labels are, optionally, used for various application
icons. In some embodiments, a label for a respective application icon includes a name of an
application corresponding to the respective application icon. In some embodiments, a label for a
particular application icon is distinct from a name of an application corresponding to the
particular application icon.
[0143]          FIG. 4B illustrates an exemplary user interface on a device (e.g., device 300, FIG.
3) with a touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a tablet or touchpad 355, FIG. 3) that is separate from
the display 450 (e.g., touch screen display 112). Device 300 also, optionally, includes one or
more contact intensity sensors (e.g., one or more of sensors 357) for detecting intensity of
contacts on touch-sensitive surface 451 and/or one or more tactile output generators 359 for
generating tactile outputs for a user of device 300.
[0144]          Although some of the examples which follow will be given with reference to
inputs on touch screen display 112 (where the touch-sensitive surface and the display are
combined), in some embodiments, the device detects inputs on a touch-sensitive surface that is
separate from the display, as shown in FIG. 4B. In some embodiments, the touch-sensitive
surface (e.g., 451 in FIG. 4B) has a primary axis (e.g., 452 in FIG. 4B) that corresponds to a
primary axis (e.g., 453 in FIG. 4B) on the display (e.g., 450). In accordance with these
embodiments, the device detects contacts (e.g., 460 and 462 in FIG. 4B) with the touch-sensitive
surface 451 at locations that correspond to respective locations on the display (e.g., in FIG. 4B,
460 corresponds to 468 and 462 corresponds to 470). In this way, user inputs (e.g., contacts 460
and 462, and movements thereof) detected by the device on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., 451
in FIG. 4B) are used by the device to manipulate the user interface on the display (e.g., 450 in
FIG. 4B) of the multifunction device when the touch-sensitive surface is separate from the
display. It should be understood that similar methods are, optionally, used for other user
interfaces described herein.
[0145]          Additionally, while the following examples are given primarily with reference to
finger inputs (e.g., finger contacts, finger tap gestures, finger swipe gestures), it should be
understood that, in some embodiments, one or more of the finger inputs are replaced with input
from another input device (e.g., a mouse-based input or stylus input). For example, a swipe
                                                   35

    WO 2015/184353                                                            PCT/US2015/033326
gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click (e.g., instead of a contact) followed by
movement of the cursor along the path of the swipe (e.g., instead of movement of the contact).
As another example, a tap gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click while the cursor is
located over the location of the tap gesture (e.g., instead of detection of the contact followed by
ceasing to detect the contact). Similarly, when multiple user inputs are simultaneously detected,
it should be understood that multiple computer mice are, optionally, used simultaneously, or a
mouse and finger contacts are, optionally, used simultaneously.
[0146]           As used here, the term "affordance" refers to a user-interactive graphical user
interface object that may be displayed on the display screen of devices 100, 300, and/or 500
(FIGS. 1, 3, and 5). For example, an image (e.g., icon), a button, and text (e.g., hyperlink) may
each constitute an affordance.
[0147]           Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces ("UI") and
associated processes that may be implemented on a multifunction device with a display, such as
device 300 or portable multifunction device 100.
[0148]           FIGS. 5A-5I illustrate exemplary user interfaces for linking a payment account to
a respective device in accordance with some embodiments. The user interfaces in these figures
are used to illustrate the processes described below, including the process in FIGS. 6A-6C.
[0149]           FIGS. 5A-5E illustrate exemplary user interfaces for receiving a request to link a
payment account, such as a bank account or revolving credit account, associated with a credit
card (e.g., a physical credit card or debit card issued to a user) to a respective device (e.g., a cell
phone, a laptop, a wearable electronic device) in accordance with some embodiments. For
example, the request can be to import credit card details from a remote server or account, such as
iTunes or an account associated with iTunes, or to manually entering card details. The request
includes information about the credit card (e.g., credit card Primary Account Number (PAN) or
security code).
[0150]           For example, in FIG. 5A, an electronic wallet is displayed. The electronic wallet
comprises a first stack of card objects 502 and a second stack of card objects 508, 510, and 512.
The first stack of card objects 502 is visually separated from the second stack of card objects
508, 510, and 512. In this example, one credit card (e.g., an American Express credit card) is
already linked to the device and is displayed as part of the first stack of card objects 502. In FIG.
5B, the device receives user input which causes the device to reveal an add card affordance 520
for the request to link a payment account (e.g., a revolving credit account held with a financial
institution) to the respective device. For example, a downward swipe on the display of device
                                                   36

    WO 2015/184353                                                            PCT/US2015/033326
 100 is used to reveal the add card affordance 520. The device receives a selection of (e.g., a
finger tap to activate) the add card affordance 520 and displays the user interface of FIG. 5C.
[0151]           FIG. 5C illustrates a user interface for selecting from among an add payment card
affordance 530 to link a payment account to the device (e.g., to make the payment account
available in the electronic wallet) and a scan code affordance 532 to link a pass. If the device
determines that selection of done affordance 534 is received, the device returns to displaying the
electronic wallet of FIG. 5A. If the device determines that selection of add payment card
affordance 530 is received, the device transitions to display of FIG. 5D.
[0152]           In FIG. 5D, the device displays a generic image of a debit or credit card 536 to
indicate to the user that the user is attempting to request linking a payment account to the
respective device. In one exemplary embodiment, the device displays, on the display, a credit
card import affordance 538 for importing, from a remote server (e.g., iTunes or an account
associated with iTunes), at least partial credit card information (e.g., information for a credit card
that has been authorized for use by a current user account). The device receives user selection of
the credit card import affordance 538 (e.g., a finger tap on the credit card import affordance
538). Alternatively, the user may manually enter credit card information (e.g., card number, card
expiration date, name on card) by selecting manual entry affordance 540 or manually enter credit
card information (e.g., card number, card expiration date, name on card) using a camera of the
device by selecting camera entry affordance 542.
[0153]           In response to receiving the user selection of the credit card import affordance
538 for importing credit card information (e.g., card number, card expiration date, name on card)
from the remote server, the device displays a credit card details screen, as illustrated in FIG. 5E.
The credit card details screen includes an indication 554 of a credit card number (e.g., credit card
Primary Account Number (PAN) truncation displaying the last four digits of the credit card) of
the credit card associated with the payment account and includes a security code input field 550
for receiving a security code (e.g., a numerical card security code such as CVD, CVV, CVC).
[0154]           The device receives a respective security code at the security code input field 550
through user input (e.g., user input at displayed keypad 552 or through taking a picture of the
credit card). The device determines validity of the credit card using verification based on the
credit card number and the respective security code. In some embodiments, after determining
that the credit card is valid, the payment account associated with the credit card is linked to the
respective device.
                                                    37

    WO 2015/184353                                                            PCT/US2015/033326
[0155]           In some embodiments, the user requests to manually input credit card information
(e.g., card number, card expiration date, name on card), rather than import credit card
information. At FIG. 5D, the user may manually enter credit card information by selecting
manual entry affordance 540 or by selecting camera entry affordance 542. In response to
receiving the user selection of the credit card input affordance for inputting credit card
information, the device displays a credit card details screen for manual entry. The credit card
details screen for manual entry includes an account input field for receiving a credit card number
(e.g., credit card Primary Account Number) associated with the payment account and includes a
security code input field for receiving a security code (e.g., a numerical card security code such
as CVD, CVV, CVC). The device receives a respective credit card number at the account input
field and a respective security code at the security code input field through user input (e.g., user
input at a displayed keypad or through taking a picture of the credit card). The device
determines validity of the credit card using verification based on the respective credit card
number and the respective security code. In some embodiments, after determining that the credit
card is valid, the payment account associated with the credit card is linked to the respective
device.
[0156]           Similarly, selecting camera entry affordance 542 of FIG. 5D allows the user to
request to enter information using the camera by taking one or more images of the credit card
(e.g., the user takes pictures of the front and/or back of a credit card using the device). The
device determines the credit card number and corresponding security code CCV based on one or
more images of the credit card for determining that the credit card is valid. In some
embodiments, after determining that the credit card is valid, the payment account associated with
the credit card is linked to the respective device.
[0157]           In response to receiving the request (e.g., the user imports the credit card
information), the device determines whether further verification is needed to link the payment
account to the respective device (e.g., is the payment account already approved by the bank to be
linked to a device or does the bank first need to confirm with the payment account owner). In
accordance with a determination that further verification is not needed to link the payment
account to the respective device, the device links the payment account to the respective device
and provides an indication (e.g., 558 of FIG. 5H) that the payment account has been linked to the
respective device. Once the payment account is linked to the respective device, the respective
device may be used to facilitate payment transactions (e.g., making a purchase in a physical store
or a purchase through the Internet using the respective device).
                                                   38

    WO 2015/184353                                                             PCT/US2015/033326
[0158]           FIG. 5G illustrates an exemplary user interface including an indication 556 that
further verification is needed. In accordance with a determination that further verification is
needed to link the payment account to the respective device, the device provides an indication
that further verification is needed to link the payment account to the respective device (e.g.,
displaying on the display that approval for linking the payment account is pending or requesting
the user to call a phone number for verification). In some embodiments, the indication that
further verification is needed to link the payment account to the respective device includes an
alphanumeric visual indicator displayed on the display of the electronic device (e.g., the
alphanumeric indicator comprising "approval pending" that indicates that further verification
steps have been initiated without additional user input). An example visual indictor is illustrated
as visual indication 556 "approval pending" of FIG. 5G. For example, a financial institution
(e.g., a bank) associated with the payment account may need to confirm details of the payment
account before the payment account is linked to the respective device. The verification may not
require additional user interaction with the financial institution.
[0159]           FIG. 5F illustrates an exemplary user interface that illustrates an indication that
further verification is needed to link the payment account to the respective device. In some
embodiments, the indication that further verification is needed to link the payment account to the
respective device includes a visual indication of additional steps to be taken by a user to link the
payment account to the respective device (e.g., instructions for the user to contact the financial
institution associated with the payment account to confirm details of the payment account before
the payment account is linked to the respective device).
[0160]           In FIG. 5F, the device displays a plurality of communication method affordances
560 and 562. In some embodiments, in accordance with the determination that further
verification is needed to link the payment account to the respective device, the device displays,
on the display, the plurality of communication method affordances 560 and 562. Each
communication method affordance is associated with a respective communication method (e.g.,
the phone number the bank should call, the phone number the user should call, the email address
the bank should email, the telephone number the bank should text) for a verification
communication (e.g., telephone call where the bank calls the user or the user calls the bank and
keys in identification information, email that provides a code or a link to a website for entering
verification information, or text message that includes information for verifying). For example,
the device may display a communication method affordance 560 indicating the phone number
that the financial institution should call for the further verification to link the payment account.
For another example, the device may display a communication method affordance 562 indicating
                                                    39

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
the email address that the financial institution should email for the further verification to link the
payment account. The plurality of communication method affordances 560 and 562 may be
based on communication received from the financial institution. For example, the financial
institution may provide the communication methods for security purposes, rather than using
communication methods from the device or communication methods that are input at the device
by the user. The communication method affordances 560 and 562 indicating the communication
methods display only part of the communication method contact information, such as the last 4
digits of phone number or the domain of the email address. This provides additional security in
the event that a user attempts to link a payment account not belonging to the user.
[0161]           In some embodiments, in accordance with the determination that further
verification is needed to link the payment account to the respective device, the device displays,
on the display, a plurality of communication method affordances 560 and 562, wherein each
communication method affordance is associated with a respective communication method (e.g.,
the phone number the bank should call, the phone number the user should call, the email address
the bank should email, the telephone number the bank should text) for a verification
communication. The display of the plurality of communication method affordances 560 and 562
are based on locally-stored contact information. For example, the locally-stored contact
information includes the respective communication methods. This allows the user to select a
communication method for the verification that the financial institution may not be aware of
(e.g., the user gets a new electronic device with a newly assigned phone number and prefers to
use the newly assigned phone number for the verification communication). The locally-stored
contact information may be a contact information card associated with the user (e.g., an entry in
the phone book of the device identified as containing the user's contact information) of the
electronic device.
[0162]           In some embodiments, in accordance with the determination that further
verification is needed to link the payment account to the respective device, the device receives a
selection of a communication method affordance of the plurality of communication method
affordances 560 and 562. In response to receiving the selection of the communication method
affordance, the device transmits, to the financial institution, an indication of the respective
communication method of the selected communication method affordance (e.g., tell the financial
institution that the user prefers to be contacted at their desk phone and display on the device that
the financial institution will contact the user at the selected phone number). The verification
communication (e.g., telephone call where the bank calls the user or the user calls the bank and
keys in identification information, email that provides a code or a link to a website for entering
                                                    40

    WO 2015/184353                                                            PCT/US2015/033326
verification information, or text message that includes information for verifying) is based on the
communication method affordance. Thus, the verification communication allows the financial
institution to efficiently contact the user to provide identifying information or verification to link
the payment account.
[0163]           In some embodiments, in accordance with the determination that further
verification is needed to link the payment account to the respective device, the device receives a
verification communication (e.g., telephone call, email, or text message) from the financial
institution associated with the payment account. The verification communication is for
verification (e.g., confirming identify of requestor) to link the payment account to the respective
device.
[0164]           In some embodiments, in accordance with the determination that further
verification is needed to link the payment account to the respective device, the device receives a
request from a user to initiate a verification communication (e.g., telephone call where the bank
calls the user or the user calls the bank and keys in identification information, email that provides
a code or a link to a website for entering verification information, or text message that includes
information for verifying) with the financial institution. In response to receiving the request to
initiate the verification communication, the device initiates the verification communication with
the financial institution associated with the payment account. If an application for the financial
institution is installed on the device, the device may offer to start application to enter
identification/authorization information. If the application is downloaded on a different device
owned by the user, the device may prompt the user to download the application onto the device.
The verification communication is for verification (e.g., confirming identify of requestor) to link
the payment account to the respective device. In some embodiments, the request to initiate
verification communication includes personally identifying information.
[0165]           In some embodiments, the device receives a notification (e.g., the device
intercepts a text message, email message, or push notification sent to the device that includes a
confirmation code) at the electronic device. The notification comprises a verification code for
linking the payment account to the respective device. In response to receiving the notification
comprising the verification code at the electronic device, the device links the payment account to
the respective device. In some embodiments, the notification is hidden from the user either by
deleting the notification or by forgoing displaying a receipt of the notification. For example, a
text message with a verification code is received at a phone and upon receiving the text message,
the phone transmits the verification code to the financial institution to verify that the user is in
possession of the phone and, optionally, deletes the text message or does not display a
                                                   41

    WO 2015/184353                                                            PCT/US2015/033326
notification of the text message and, instead, removes the "approval pending" indicator and
visually indicates that the payment account has been linked to the device.
[0166]          In some embodiments, the device displays a confirmation on the display
indicating that the payment account has been linked to the respective device comprising
displaying a notification (e.g., a pop-up or banner from the electronic wallet application) on the
device indicating that the payment account has been linked to the respective device, such as
"approved" confirmation 558 illustrated in FIG. 5H. The notification may be displayed while
accessing the electronic wallet or while a different application (or no application) is being
displayed.
[0167]          In some embodiments, the device receives a user input requesting a secondary
verification code (e.g., user activates an affordance to request verification again) for linking the
payment account to the respective device. For example, the user can access the electronic wallet
and select a "re-verify" affordance. In response to receiving the input requesting the secondary
verification code, the device transmits a request to the financial institution to request the
secondary verification code (e.g., in case the first verification code is not received or expires
before verification is complete).
[0168]          In some embodiments, the device receives a secondary notification (e.g., the
device intercepts a text message, email message, or push notification that includes a confirmation
code) at the electronic device. The secondary notification comprises the secondary verification
code for linking the payment account to the respective device. In response to receiving the
secondary notification comprising the secondary verification code at the electronic device, the
device links the payment account to the respective device and displays a confirmation (e.g.,
"approved" 558 of FIG. 5H) on the device indicating that the payment account has been linked to
the respective device.
[0169]          In some embodiments, the device receives a primary account number (e.g.,
Digital PAN, DPAN, a 16-digit account number, or other account number, which, for example,
cannot be used for completing a manual transaction over a voice call-only for completing a
payment electronically through the device) from the financial institution for use in authorizing
payments from the payment account using the respective device. The received primary account
number is different than the account number displayed on the credit card (e.g., credit card PAN,
16-digit credit card number). In some embodiments, the device assigns the received primary
account number (e.g., Digital PAN, DPAN, a 16-digit account number, or other account number)
to the respective device to link the payment account to the respective device. This may, for
                                                  42

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
example, allow the financial institution to differentiate between payment transactions conducted
using the received primary account number, which is associated with the payment account,
assigned to the respective device and payment transactions conducted using the credit card,
which is also associated with the payment account.
[0170]          In some embodiments, the credit card details screen of FIG. 5E includes a
displayed visual graphical representation 504 of the credit card associated with the payment
account. For example, the graphical representation comprises the background image of the
physical credit card associated with the payment account when the user selects to import credit
card information. Displaying the same background image as the physical credit card allows the
user to easily recognize which credit card is being used for linking the payment account.
[0171]          In some embodiments, the respective device is a second electronic device (e.g., a
cell phone, a laptop, a wearable electronic device) that is separate from the electronic device.
For example, the electronic device can be used to link the payment account to a separate cell
phone. This may be done, for example, by transmitting provisioning information from the
electronic device to the respective device (e.g., the separate device), wherein the provisioning
information is used to link the payment account to the respective device (e.g., the separate
device). In some embodiments, a similar process can be repeated to link the payment account to
the electronic device (optionally with a different DPAN). In another embodiment, the respective
device is the same as the electronic device, and the electronic device is a mobile
telecommunications device (e.g., a cell phone, a laptop, a wearable electronic device).
[0172]          In some embodiments, the device determines (e.g., prior to linking the payment
account to the respective device) whether the respective device is configured to require an
unlock authorization (e.g., passcode) for unlocking the respective device. In accordance with a
determination that the respective device is not configured to require an unlock authorization, the
device displays, on the display, an unlock authorization configurator for configuring the
respective device to require unlock authorization for unlocking or accessing certain features of
the respective device. This provides additional security by requiring that the respective device
have a lock authorization to access the device under (at least some) circumstances. For example,
the authorization configurator may be used to enroll a fingerprint or passcode that is enabled to
authorize payment transactions.
[0173]          FIG. 5I illustrates an electronic wallet that includes representations of multiple
payment accounts 502 and 504. In some embodiments, the device receives a second request to
link a second payment account (e.g., a revolving credit account with a financial institution)

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
associated with a second credit card to the respective device. The second request includes
information about the second credit card (e.g., selecting the credit card for import and/or entering
the card security code). For example, a similar technique, as discussed above, may be used for
requesting to link the second payment account to the respective device. The device links the
second payment account to the respective device and provides an indication that the second
payment account has been linked to the respective device. The device receives a selection from
among at least the payment account and the second payment account specifying the default
payment account to be used for payment transactions.
[0174]          FIGS. 6A-6C are flow diagrams illustrating method 600 for linking a payment
account to a respective device in accordance with some embodiments. Method 600 is performed
at a device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or portable multifunction device 100, Figure 1) with a
display. Some operations in method 600 may be combined, the order of some operations may be
changed, and some operations may be omitted.
[0175]          As described below, method 600 provides an intuitive way to link a payment
account to a respective device. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when linking
the payment account, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery
operated computing devices, enabling a user to link a payment account to a respective device
faster and more efficiently conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.
[0176]          At block 602, the electronic device receives a request (e.g., request to import card
details from iTunes or manually entering card details) to link a payment account (e.g., a
revolving credit account held with a financial institution) associated with a credit card (e.g., a
physical credit card or debit card issued to the user) to a respective device (e.g., a cell phone, a
laptop, a wearable electronic device, device 300, Figure 3, or portable multifunction device 100,
Figure 1), wherein the request includes information about the credit card (e.g., entering the card
security code).
[0177]          At block 604, in some embodiments, receiving the request to link the payment
account comprises receiving a request to import credit card information. The device displays on
the display, a credit card import affordance for importing, from a remote server, at least partial
credit card information (e.g., information for a credit card that has been authorized for use by a
current user account). The device receives user selection of the credit card import affordance. In
response to receiving the user selection of the credit card import affordance for importing credit
card information from the remote server: the device displays a credit card details screen, wherein
the credit card details screen includes an indication of a credit card number (e.g., credit card

Primary Account Number (PAN) truncation displaying the last four digits of the credit card) of
the credit card associated with the payment account and includes a security code input field for
receiving a security code (e.g., a numerical card security code such as CVD, CVV, CVC); the
device receives a respective security code at the security code input field through user input (e.g.,
user input at a displayed keypad or through taking a picture of the credit card); and the device
determines validity of the credit card using verification based on the credit card number and the
respective security code. In some embodiments, after determining that the credit card is valid,
the payment account associated with the credit card is linked to the respective device.
[0178]           At block 606, in some embodiments, receiving the request to link the payment
account comprises receiving a request to manually enter credit card information. The device
displays, on the display, a credit card input affordance for receiving credit card information
through user input at the electronic device. The device receives user selection of the credit card
input affordance. In response to receiving the user selection of the credit card input affordance
for inputting credit card information: the device displays a credit card details screen, wherein the
credit card details screen includes an account input field for receiving a credit card number (e.g.,
credit card Primary Account Number) associated with the payment account and includes a
security code input field for receiving a security code (e.g., a numerical card security code such
as CVD, CVV, CVC); the device receives a respective credit card number at the account input
field and a respective security code at the security code input field through user input (e.g., user
input at a displayed keypad or through taking a picture of the credit card); and the device
determines validity of the credit card using verification based on the respective credit card
number and the respective security code. In some embodiments, after determining that the credit
card is valid, the payment account associated with the credit card is linked to the respective
device.
[0179]           At block 608, in response to receiving the request to link the payment account, the
device determines at block 610 whether further verification is needed to link the payment
account to the respective device (e.g., is it already approved by the bank or does the bank need to
confirm with the user). At block 612, in accordance with a determination that further
verification is not needed to link the payment account to the respective device, the device links
the payment account to the respective device and provides an indication that the payment
account has been linked to the respective device.
[0180]           At block 614, in accordance with a determination that further verification is
needed to link the payment account to the respective device, the device provides an indication

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
that further verification is needed to link the payment account to the respective device (e.g.,
displaying on the display that approval for linking the payment account is pending).
[0181]           In some embodiments, the indication that further verification is needed to link the
payment account to the respective device includes an alphanumeric visual indicator displayed on
the display of the electronic device (e.g., the alphanumeric indicator comprising "approval
pending" that indicates that further verification steps have been initiated without additional user
input, visual indication 556 of FIG. 5G). For example, a financial institution associated with the
payment account may need to confirm details of the payment account before the payment
account is linked to the respective device. The verification may not require additional user
interaction with the financial institution.
[0182]           In some embodiments, the indication that further verification is needed to link the
payment account to the respective device includes a visual indication of additional steps to be
taken by a user to link the payment account to the respective device (e.g., instructions for the
user to contact the financial institution associated with the payment account to confirm details of
the payment account before the payment account is linked to the respective device).
[0183]           At block 616, in some embodiments, in accordance with the determination that
further verification is needed to link the payment account to the respective device, the device
displays, on the display, the plurality of communication method affordances (e.g., 560 and 562
of FIG. 5F). Each communication method affordance is associated with a respective
communication method (e.g., the phone number the bank should call, the phone number the user
should call, the email address the bank should email, the telephone number the bank should text)
for a verification communication (e.g., telephone call where the bank calls the user or the user
calls the bank and keys in identification information, email that provides a code or a link to a
website for entering verification information, or text message that includes information for
verifying).
[0184]           In some embodiments, in accordance with the determination that further
verification is needed to link the payment account to the respective device, the device displays,
on the display, a plurality of communication method affordances (e.g., 560 and 562 of FIG. 5F),
wherein each communication method affordance is associated with a respective communication
method (e.g., the phone number the bank should call, the phone number the user should call, the
email address the bank should email, the telephone number the bank should text) for a
verification communication. The display of the plurality of communication method affordances
are based on locally-stored contact information. For example, the locally-stored contact
                                                   46

    WO 2015/184353                                                             PCT/US2015/033326
information includes the respective communication methods. This allows the user to select a
communication method for the verification that the financial institution may not be aware of
(e.g., the user gets a new electronic device with a newly assigned phone number and prefers to
use the newly assigned phone number for the verification communication). The locally-stored
contact information may be a contact information card associated with the user (e.g., an entry in
the phone book of the device identified as containing the user's contact information) of the
electronic device.
[0185]           At block 618, in some embodiments, in accordance with the determination that
further verification is needed to link the payment account to the respective device, the device
receives a selection of a communication method affordance of the plurality of communication
method affordances (e.g., 560 and 562 of FIG. 5F). In response to receiving the selection of the
communication method affordance, the device transmits, to the financial institution, an
indication of the respective communication method of the selected communication method
affordance (e.g., tell the financial institution that the user prefers to be contacted at their desk
phone and display on the device that the financial institution will contact the user at the selected
phone number). The verification communication (e.g., telephone call where the bank calls the
user or the user calls the bank and keys in identification information, email that provides a code
or a link to a website for entering verification information, or text message that includes
information for verifying) is based on the communication method affordance. Thus, the
verification communication allows the financial institution to efficiently contact the user to
provide identifying information or verification to link the payment account.
[0186]           At block 620, in some embodiments, in accordance with the determination that
further verification is needed to link the payment account to the respective device, the device
receives a verification communication (e.g., telephone call, email, or text message) from the
financial institution associated with the payment account. The verification communication is for
verification (e.g., confirming identify of requestor) to link the payment account to the respective
device.
[0187]           At block 622, in some embodiments, in accordance with the determination that
further verification is needed to link the payment account to the respective device, the device
receives a request from a user to initiate a verification communication (e.g., telephone call where
the bank calls the user or the user calls the bank and keys in identification information, email that
provides a code or a link to a website for entering verification information, or text message that
includes information for verifying) with the financial institution. In response to receiving the
request to initiate the verification communication, the device initiates the verification
                                                    47

    WO 2015/184353                                                            PCT/US2015/033326
communication with the financial institution associated with the payment account. The
verification communication is for verification (e.g., confirming identify of requestor) to link the
payment account to the respective device. In some embodiments, the request to initiate
verification communication includes personally identifying information.
[0188]           At block 624, in some embodiments, the device receives a notification (e.g., the
device intercepts a text message, email message, or push notification sent to the device that
includes a confirmation code) at the electronic device. The notification comprises a verification
code for linking the payment account to the respective device. In response to receiving the
notification comprising the verification code at the electronic device, the device links the
payment account to the respective device. In some embodiments, the notification is hidden from
the user either by deleting the notification or by forgoing displaying a receipt of the notification.
For example, a text message with a verification code is received at a phone and, upon receiving
the text message, the phone transmits the verification code to the financial institution to verify
that the user is in possession of the phone and, optionally, deletes the text message or does not
display a notification of the text message and, instead, removes the "approval pending" indicator
and visually indicates that the payment account has been linked to the device.
[0189]           At block 626, in some embodiments, the device displays a confirmation (e.g., 558
of FIG. 5H) on the display indicating that the payment account has been linked to the respective
device comprising displaying a notification (e.g., a pop-up or banner from the electronic wallet
application) on the device indicating that the payment account has been linked to the respective
device. The notification may be displayed while accessing the electronic wallet or while a
different application (or no application) is being displayed.
[0190]           In some embodiments, the device receives a user input requesting a secondary
verification code (e.g., user activates an affordance to request verification again) for linking the
payment account to the respective device. For example, the user can access the electronic wallet
and select a "re-verify" affordance. In response to receiving the input requesting the secondary
verification code, the device transmits a request to the financial institution to request the
secondary verification code (e.g., in case the first verification code is not received or expires
before verification is complete).
[0191]           In some embodiments, the device receives a secondary notification (e.g., the
device intercepts a text message, email message, or push notification that includes a confirmation
code) at the electronic device. The secondary notification comprises the secondary verification
code for linking the payment account to the respective device. In response to receiving the
                                                  48

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
secondary notification comprising the secondary verification code at the electronic device, the
device links the payment account to the respective device and displays a confirmation (e.g., 558
of FIG. 5H) on the device indicating that the payment account has been linked to the respective
device.
[0192]          At block 628, in some embodiments, the device receives a primary account
number (e.g., Digital PAN, DPAN, a 16-digit account number, or other account number, which,
for example cannot be used for completing a manual transaction over a voice call-only for
completing a payment electronically through the device.) from the financial institution for use in
authorizing payments from the payment account using the respective device. The received
primary account number is different than the account number displayed on the credit card (e.g.,
credit card PAN, 16-digit credit card number). At block 630, in some embodiments, the device
assigns the received primary account number (e.g., Digital PAN, DPAN, a 16-digit account
number, or other account number) to the respective device to link the payment account to the
respective device. This may, for example, allow the financial institution to differentiate between
payment transactions conducted using the received primary account number, which is associated
with the payment account, assigned to the respective device and payment transactions conducted
using the credit card, which is also associated with the payment account.
[0193]          In some embodiments, the credit card details screen (e.g., of FIG. 5E) includes a
displayed visual graphical representation (e.g., 504 of FIG. 5E) of the credit card associated with
the payment account. For example, the graphical representation comprises the background
image of the physical credit card associated with the payment account when the user selects to
import credit card information. Displaying the same background image as the physical credit
card allows the user to easily recognize which credit card is being used for linking the payment
account.
[0194]          In some embodiments, the respective device is a second electronic device (e.g., a
cell phone, a laptop, a wearable electronic device) that is separate from the electronic device.
For example, the electronic device can be used to link the payment account to a separate cell
phone. This may be done, for example, by transmitting provisioning information from the
electronic device to the respective device (e.g., the separate device), wherein the provisioning
information is used to link the payment account to the respective device (e.g., the separate
device). In some embodiments, a similar process can be repeated to link the payment account to
the electronic device (optionally with a different DPAN). In another embodiment, the respective
device is the same as the electronic device, and the electronic device is a mobile
telecommunications device (e.g., a cell phone, a laptop, a wearable electronic device).

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
[0195]          At block 632, in some embodiments, the device determines (e.g., prior to linking
the payment account to the respective device) whether the respective device is configured to
require an unlock authorization (e.g., passcode) for unlocking the respective device. In
accordance with a determination that the respective device is not configured to require an unlock
authorization, the device displays, on the display, an unlock authorization configurator for
configuring the respective device to require unlock authorization for unlocking or accessing
certain features of the respective device. This provides additional security by requiring that the
respective device have a lock authorization to access the device under (at least some)
circumstances. For example, the authorization configurator may be used to enroll a fingerprint
or passcode that is enabled to authorize payment transactions. In some embodiments, the device
links the payment account to the respective device after completing the unlock authorization
configurator process.
[0196]          At block 634, in some embodiments, the device receives a second request to link
a second payment account (e.g., a revolving credit account with a financial institution) associated
with a second credit card to the respective device. The second request includes information
about the second credit card (e.g., selecting the credit card for import and/or entering the card
security code). For example, a similar technique as discussed above may be used for requesting
to link the second payment account to the respective device. The device links the second
payment account to the respective device and provides an indication that the second payment
account has been linked to the respective device. The device receives a selection from among at
least the payment account and the second payment account specifying the default payment
account to be used for payment transactions.
[0197]          Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method 600
(e.g., FIGS. 6A-6C and 5A-51) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the methods
described below. For example, methods 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000, and 2200
may include one or more of the characteristics of the various methods described above with
reference to method 600. For example, the requests, linkings, payment accounts, credit cards,
devices, indications, and other user interface elements described above with reference to method
600 optionally have one or more of the characteristics of requests, linkings, payment accounts,
credit cards, devices, indications, and other user interface elements described herein with
reference to other methods described herein. For brevity, these details are not repeated below.
[0198]          The operations described above with reference to the figures may be implemented
by components depicted in FIGS. 1A-lB. For example, receive operations, display operations,
and determination operations may be implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180,

and event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch
sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to
application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event
information to respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a first
location on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as
selection of an object on a user interface. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is
detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the
event or sub-event. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176 or object updater 177
to update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a
respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it would
be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be implemented
based on the components depicted in FIGS. lA-lB.
[0199]          FIGS. 7A-70 illustrate exemplary techniques and user interfaces for proceeding
with a payment transaction using a short-range communication radio, such as a near field
communication (NFC) radio, in accordance with some embodiments. The techniques and user
interfaces in these figures are used to illustrate the processes described below, including the
process in FIGS. 8A-8B.
[0200]          FIGS. 7A-7B illustrate an exemplary technique for proceeding with a payment
transaction using a short-range communication radio, such as a NFC radio. The NFC standards,
which are related to radio-frequency identification (RFID) standards, describe communication
protocols for transferring information between two devices, such as for making payments. It
should be appreciated, however, that other communications standards and techniques may also
be used.
[0201]          Multifunction device 100 (and device 300) may include near field
communications circuitry, such as a short range communication radio. Accordingly, device 100
can wirelessly communicate with external equipment, such as NFC-enabled contactless payment
transaction terminal 2000, using near field communications. For example, the near field
communications circuitry in device 100 may include a near field transmitter and a near field
receiver. Near field communications for device 100 may be supported using capacitive coupling
near field communications structures and/or inductive coupling near field communications
structures. In near field communications techniques, wireless signals are typically conveyed, for
example, over distances of 1 m or less, 100 cm or less, 10 cm or less, or 1 cm or less, and are not
conveyed over longer distances.
                                                    51

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
[0202]           In FIG. 7A, the NFC-enabled contactless payment transaction terminal 2000
generates a field 2002. For example, an NFC-enabled device that enters the field 2002 can
communicate with the contactless payment transaction terminal 2000 using NFC. In FIG. 7A,
the electronic device 100 has not been placed in the field 2002. The contactless payment
transaction terminal 2000 may be part of a payment system (e.g., check register) installed in a
retail store for processing payment transactions, such as purchases of products and services.
[0203]           In some embodiments, electronic device 100 receives authorization (e.g., from the
user, as described in detail below) to proceed with a payment transaction prior to detecting
presence of the field 2002 (e.g., an NFC compliant RF field) generated by the contactless
payment transaction terminal 2000. The authorization is only valid for a predetermined period of
time (e.g., up to 30 seconds). If the user places the device into field 2002 after receiving
authorization and before the predetermined period of time has elapsed, the device will proceed
with the payment transaction (e.g., a payment of funds being solicited by the contactless payment
transaction terminal 2000). After the predetermined period of time has elapsed, the device will
no longer have authorization to proceed with the payment transaction (unless the user authorizes
the device again), and accordingly the device will not proceed with the payment transaction,
even if placed within range of the field 2002. Thus, the device does not stay authorized
indefinitely after receiving authorization to proceed with a payment transaction.
[0204]           In FIG. 7B, the user places the electronic device 100 into the field 2002. The
electronic device detects, by the short-range communication radio of the electronic device,
presence of the field 2002 (e.g., the NFC compliant RF field) generated by the contactless
payment transaction terminal 2000 (e.g., an NFC-compliant payment transaction terminal). In
some embodiments, the electronic device detects the field and communication initiation signal
from the contactless payment transaction terminal 2000. In response to detecting presence of the
field 2002 generated by the contactless payment transaction terminal 2000, the device determines
whether authorization to proceed with a payment transaction is provided. For example, the
device determines whether the device has been pre-authorized by the user (e.g., prior to the
device detecting the field 2002, as discussed above) for proceeding with payment transactions or
whether the user is currently authorizing the device to proceed with the payment transaction
(e.g., the user has placed a finger on a fingerprint sensor for authorization).
[0205]           In some embodiments, while the device is within range of the field generated by
the contactless payment transaction terminal, the device detects a respective fingerprint on a
fingerprint sensor of the electronic device. In response to detecting the respective fingerprint on
the fingerprint sensor, the device determines whether the fingerprint is consistent with an
                                                   52

    WO 2015/184353                                                            PCT/US2015/033326
enrolled fingerprint that is enabled to authorize payment transactions. In accordance with a
determination that a respective fingerprint is consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device
authorizes the payment transaction. For example, a user places their finger on the fingerprint
sensor of the device (e.g., without turning on the display of the device or opening any particular
application) and then places the device into the field 2002. When the device detects the field
2002, the device reads the fingerprint and determines that the user has provided authorization to
make a payment using the device. In accordance with a determination that the respective
fingerprint is not consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device forgoes authorization of the
payment transaction. In other words, the device is not authorized to proceed with the payment
transaction, meaning authorization is still required to proceed with the payment transaction.
[0206]           In some embodiments, the user interface of the electronic device is locked when
presence of the field generated is detected and the display of the electronic device is off when
presence of the field generated is detected. In response to detecting the presence of the field
2002 generated by the contactless payment transaction terminal 2002, the device turns the
display on.
[0207]           FIG. 7C illustrates an exemplary user interface for authorizing the device in order
to proceed with the payment transaction. In some embodiments, in response to detecting
presence of the field 2002 generated by the contactless payment transaction terminal 2000, the
device displays an electronic wallet, as illustrated in FIG. 7C (e.g., if the device is placed in
range of the field 2002 while the device is unlocked). The electronic wallet includes a plurality
of payment card affordances (such as payment card affordances 704 and 708). For example, the
user interface of FIG. 7C allows the user to easily determine which payment account will be used
if the device proceeds with the payment transaction. In this example, the payment card
affordance 704 is displayed at the top of the display, indicating that the payment account
associated with the payment card affordance 704 will be used for payment.
[0208]           In accordance with a determination that authorization to proceed with the
payment transaction has been provided (e.g., the user provided authorization prior to entering the
field 2002 or the user provides authorization while the device is in the field 2002), the device
proceeds with the payment transaction with the contactless payment transaction terminal 2000
(e.g., transmitting an identifier such as a PAN to the contactless payment transaction terminal
2000 for use in completing the payment transaction).
[0209]           In some embodiments, proceeding with the payment transaction with the
contactless payment transaction terminal 2002 comprises using a linked payment account (e.g., a
                                                   53

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
payment account linked to the electronic device and stored in an electronic wallet) to complete
the payment transaction. In some embodiments, proceeding with the payment transaction with
the contactless payment transaction terminal 2002 comprises using a primary account number for
use in the payment transaction (e.g., using the credit account to make the purchase) to complete
the payment transaction, where the primary account number is stored on the electronic device.
[0210]          In some embodiments, in accordance with the determination that authorization to
proceed with the payment transaction has been provided, the device determines whether the
payment transaction is successfully completed. In response to determining the payment
transaction is successfully completed, the device plays, at the electronic device, a success audio
alert. The success audio alert indicates that the payment transaction is successfully completed.
In some embodiments, the success audio alert is different than a failure audio alert.
[0211]          Similarly, providing non-audio notifications to the user of the device is helpful for
the user to understand whether additional input is required. In some embodiments, in accordance
with the determination that authorization to proceed with the payment transaction has been
provided (e.g., the device is armed), the device determines whether the payment transaction is
successfully completed. In response to determining the payment transaction is successfully
completed, the device causes a success haptic alert indicating that the payment transaction is
successfully completed. In one example, the success haptic alert is different than a failure haptic
alert. For example, the failure haptic alert is longer in duration and more intense than the success
haptic alert.
[0212]          FIG. 7C illustrates an exemplary user interface for authorizing the device in order
to proceed with the payment transaction. In accordance with a determination that authorization
to proceed with the payment transaction has not been provided (e.g., the device is not armed), the
device provides an indication requesting authorization to proceed with the payment transaction.
For example, the indication may be a display of a fingerprint visual indicator (e.g., 7 1OA of FIG.
7C) on the display or the indication may be producing a haptic alert at the device (or both the
visual indicator and the haptic alert). These indications requesting authorization to proceed with
the payment transaction provide an intuitive user interface to let the user know that the
contactless payment transaction terminal 2000 is capable of processing (or is attempting to
process) a payment transaction using the device.
[0213]          In some embodiments, the indication requesting authorization to proceed with the
payment transaction includes detecting, by the short-range communication radio, whether the
device continues to be in the presence of the field 2002. In response to detecting that the device
                                                  54

    WO 2015/184353                                                             PCT/US2015/033326
does not continue to be in the presence of the field, the device displays, on the display, a visual
indicator indicating that authentication has failed or has not been provided). The visual indicator
is helpful because the user may be looking at the device while the device is not in the field 2002.
In response to detecting that the device continues to be in the presence of the field, causing, at
the electronic device, a non-visual alert (e.g., haptic or audio alert) indicating that authentication
has failed (or has not been provided). The non-visual alert is helpful because the user may not be
looking at the display when the device is in the field 2002. In some embodiments, a similar
approach is used to indicate success of the authentication. When the device is out of the field,
the user is likely able to easily look at the display, whereas when the device is in the field, the
user is not likely to be able to easily look at the display, thus providing a non-visual alert when
the device is in the field provides a more intuitive user interface for the device.
[0214]           In some embodiments, providing an indication requesting authorization to
proceed with the payment transaction includes displaying, on the display, instruction (e.g.,
prompt user to authenticate using fingerprint reader, 710A of FIG. 7C) for authorizing to proceed
with the payment transaction. In some embodiments, providing an indication requesting
authorization to proceed with the payment transaction comprises causing, at the electronic
device, a haptic alert instead of, or in addition to, the instruction for authorizing to proceed with
the payment transaction.
[0215]           In some embodiments, providing the indication requesting authorization to
proceed with the payment transaction comprises displaying an authorization request screen on
the display of the electronic device, such as illustrated in FIG. 7C. The authorization request
screen includes a graphical representation 704 of the credit card associated with the payment
account, and the graphical representation 704 includes the background image of the credit card
associated with the payment account. In some embodiments, the graphical representation 704
also includes other information identifying the credit card associated with the payment account,
such as a name of the credit card holder, a credit card number from the physical credit card (even
if the credit card number from the physical credit card is different from the account number
linked to the device), and/or an expiration date.
[0216]           In some embodiments, after detecting the presence of the field 2002 generated by
the contactless payment transaction terminal when authorization to proceed with the payment
transaction has not been provided (e.g., the user has not provided authorization to the device), the
device detects, by the short-range communication radio, that the device is no longer in range of
the field 2002 generated by the contactless payment transaction terminal 2000. In response to
detecting that the device is no longer in range of the field 2002 (e.g., the user is not holding the
                                                    55

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
device over the contactless payment transaction terminal 2000), the device displays a plurality of
payment card affordances (e.g., payment card affordances 704 and 708 of FIG. 7C) associated
with different payment accounts. The device receives authorization to proceed with the payment
transaction for a predetermined period of time with one of the payment accounts (e.g., in
response to detecting a user input selecting a "pay with this payment account" option in a
displayed representation of a payment account).
[0217]           At FIG. 7C, the device provides an indication that a default payment card
affordance 704 of the plurality of payment card affordances 704 and 708 is selected as a default
payment account. The default primary account number associated with the default payment card
affordance is selected for use in the payment transaction (e.g., when the user does not select a
different payment account for use in the payment transaction). In some embodiments, different
payment accounts are assigned as the default payment account based on current environmental
factors, such as the current day of month, time of day, and/or location. In some embodiments,
different payment accounts are assigned as the default card based on the budget available on one
or more payment accounts. For example, a payment account that has reached a maximum
budget (or has reached a threshold based on the maximum budget) will not be used as the default
payment account.
[0218]           However, a user can select an alternate payment card affordance (such as one of
the plurality of payment card affordances 704 and 708). The device receives the selection (e.g.,
a finger tap) of the alternate payment card affordance of the plurality of payment card
affordances 704 and 708, where the alternate payment card affordance is associated with a
respective alternate primary account number. In response to receiving the selection of the
alternate payment card affordance, the device selects the respective alternate primary account
number for use in the payment transaction (rather than the default primary account number).
[0219]           In some embodiments, in accordance with the determination that authorization to
proceed with the payment transaction has not been provided, the device receives authorization
(e.g., receiving a passcode for payment or detecting a fingerprint for payment) to proceed with a
payment transaction for a predetermined period of time (e.g., up to 30 seconds). For example,
the user places the device into the field 2002 and is prompted to provide authorization, as
discussed above. The user then removes the device from the field 2002 and provides
authorization using the fingerprint sensor or a passcode. The authorization is valid for a
predetermined period of time (e.g., 30 seconds). If the user places the device into field 2002
before the predetermined period of time has elapsed, the device will proceed with the payment
transaction. After the predetermined period of time has elapsed, the device will no longer have
                                                  56

    WO 2015/184353                                                             PCT/US2015/033326
authorization to proceed with the payment transaction (unless the user authorizes the device
again), and accordingly the device will not proceed with the payment transaction. Thus, the
device does not stay authorized indefinitely after receiving authorization to proceed with a
payment transaction.
[0220]           FIGS. 7D-7G illustrate various exemplary user interfaces and techniques for
receiving authorization to proceed with the payment transaction. As discussed above, in some
embodiments, authorization to proceed with the payment transaction can be provided through the
fingerprint sensor 702. At FIG. 7D, the device detects a respective fingerprint on a fingerprint
sensor 702 of the electronic device. In response to detecting the respective fingerprint on the
fingerprint sensor, the device determines that the fingerprint is consistent with an enrolled
fingerprint that is enabled to authorize payment transactions. The device displays progress of the
determination of whether the respective fingerprint is consistent with an enrolled fingerprint by
at least partially filling in the fingerprint visual indicator 71 OA, as shown in the partially filled
fingerprint visual indicator 710B. In accordance with a determination that a respective
fingerprint is consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device can authorize the payment
transaction. The device may also display progress of the payment transaction process by further
filling in the fingerprint visual indicator 710B. The device provides an indication (e.g.,
checkmark 730 of FIG. 7K) when the payment transaction is completed.
[0221]           FIG. 7E illustrates an exemplary user interface where authentication using the
fingerprint sensor has failed. In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the
respective fingerprint is not consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device displays, on the
display, a visual prompt (712 of FIG. 7E) instructing a user to place a finger on the fingerprint
sensor 702.
[0222]           FIGS. 7E-7F illustrate various exemplary user interfaces to authenticate using a
passcode. In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the respective
fingerprint is not consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device displays, on the display, an
affordance 714 for receiving authorization to proceed with the payment transaction using a
payment passcode (rather than the fingerprint sensor). The device also indicates to the user that
authentication has failed by, for example, providing visual prompt 712. If the device receives
selection of the affordance 714 for receiving authorization, the device displays a keypad 740 for
receiving a payment passcode entry, such as illustrated in FIG. 7L. In FIG. 7F, the user attempts
to authenticate again using the fingerprint sensor 702. The device displays progress of the
determination of whether the respective fingerprint is consistent with an enrolled fingerprint by
at least partially filling in the fingerprint visual indicator, as shown in the partially filled
                                                     57

    WO 2015/184353                                                            PCT/US2015/033326
fingerprint visual indicator 710B of FIG. 7F. If the device determines that the respective
fingerprint is consistent with an enrolled fingerprint, the device display the completely filled
fingerprint visual indicator 710C of FIG. 7G.
[0223]           In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the respective
fingerprint is not consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device plays, at the electronic
device, a failure audio alert through a speaker. The failure audio alert indicates that
authorization to proceed with the payment transaction has not been provided. Providing an audio
notification to the user of the device of the status (or state) of the technique is helpful for the user
to understand whether additional input is required.
[0224]           In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the respective
fingerprint is not consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device causes a failure haptic alert
indicating that authorization to proceed with the payment transaction has not been provided. The
haptic feedback is particularly helpful to the user if the user has placed the device into the field
2002 and is not looking at the display.
[0225]           FIG. 7F illustrates an exemplary user interface for authentication using the
fingerprint sensor after one or more failed attempts at authenticating using the fingerprint sensor.
In some embodiments, the electronic device determines whether a predetermined number of
attempts to receive authorization to proceed with the payment transaction using the fingerprint
sensor has been reached. In accordance with a determination that the predetermined number of
attempts to receive authorization has been reached, the device requires authorization using a
payment passcode to proceed with the payment transaction, such as in the user interface
illustrated in FIG. 7L. For example, the predetermined number of attempts is three. Thus, after
the third failed attempt to authorize using the fingerprint sensor, the device requires authorization
using a payment passcode to proceed with the payment transaction.
[0226]           FIGS. 7M-70 illustrate various exemplary user interfaces for receiving
authorization to proceed with the payment transaction. As discussed above, authorization to
proceed with the payment transaction can be provided through receiving a payment passcode. In
some embodiments, the device receives a payment passcode at the electronic device. The device
determines that the payment passcode is consistent with an enrolled passcode that is enabled to
authorize payment transactions. In response to determining that the payment passcode is
consistent with the enrolled passcode (e.g., a passcode programmed by the user for unlocking the
device or for making payments), the device authorizes the payment transaction. For example,
authorization can be received using a payment passcode when authorization using the fingerprint
                                                   58

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
sensor 702 has failed. If the electronic device does not support authorization using the
fingerprint sensor 702 (e.g., the feature has been disabled or the device does not have a
fingerprint sensor 702), the user interface of FIG. 7M may be displayed instead of the user
interface of FIG. 7C. At FIG. 7N, the device receives selection of the payment passcode
affordance 732. In response, the device displays keypad 740 for receiving a payment passcode
entry, such as illustrated in FIG. 70.
[0227]           In some embodiments, the predetermined period of time is based on a current
location of the electronic device. For example, when the device determines that the current
location is at a department store, the predetermined period of time may be set to 15 seconds. In
another example, when the device determines that the current location is a concert or theater
venue, the predetermined period of time may be set to 45 seconds. This may, for example, help
to accommodate delays such as standing in line or making a purchase decision. Having a
predetermined period of time that is based on the location may also help limit fraud.
[0228]           In some embodiments, the predetermined period of time is based on a credit score
associated with the payment account. For example, the predetermined period of time may be
based on creditworthiness. In one example, the predetermined period of time may be set to 30
seconds when the credit score associated with the payment account is above a threshold,
indicating good credit. In another example, the predetermined period of time may be set to 15
seconds when the credit score associated with the payment account is below a threshold,
indicating not good credit (e.g., poor credit). For example, a predetermined period of time that is
based on a credit score may help limit fraud.
[0229]           In some embodiments, the predetermined period of time is user-configurable. For
example, a user may decide that a longer predetermined period of time may be helpful in
proceeding with payment transactions. Thus, the user can increase the predetermined period of
time to value, such as 60 seconds, that is higher than the default value. For example, a
predetermined period of time that is user configurable may help limit fraud.
[0230]           FIGS. 7H-7J illustrate various exemplary user interfaces for indicating that
authorization to proceed with a payment transaction has been provided. In some embodiments,
in response to receiving authorization to proceed with the payment transaction, (e.g., through a
passcode or the fingerprint sensor 702), the device displays a graphical indication 720A-720C
that authorization to proceed has been provided. In some embodiments, the graphical indication
includes an indication to place the device in the field (e.g., an animated icon that shows a device
moving to indicate that the device needs to be moved to be placed in range of the field 2002).
                                                  59

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
For example, graphical indication 720A-720C is an animation illustrating an electronic device,
such as a cellular phone, starting at a substantially vertical position (720A, FIG. 7H), being bent
down (backwards) from the substantially vertical position (720B, FIG. 71), and returning to the
substantially vertical position (720C, FIG. 7J). This indicates to the user that authorization to
proceed with the payment transaction has been provided to the electronic device, and that the
user should place the electronic device into the field 2002 to proceed with the payment
transaction.
[0231]          FIG. 7K illustrates an exemplary user interface for indicating that the payment
transaction was completed. In some embodiments, in response to receiving authorization to
proceed with the payment transaction, the device proceeds with the payment transaction (e.g.,
processes the payment transaction using the NFC-enabled contactless payment transaction
terminal 2000 when the device is within range of the field 2002 and the authorization has not
expired). In some examples, the device provides an indication (e.g., checkmark 730 of FIG. 7K)
when the payment transaction is completed.
[0232]          FIGS. 8A-8B are flow diagrams illustrating a method 800 for proceeding with a
payment transaction using a short-range communication radio (e.g., an NFC radio) in accordance
with some embodiments. It should be appreciated that other communications standards and
techniques may be used. Method 800 is performed at a device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or
portable multifunction device 100, Figure 1) with a display and a short-range communication
radio. Some operations in method 800 may be combined, the order of some operations may be
changed, and some operations may be omitted.
[0233]          As described below, method 800 provides an intuitive way to proceed with a
payment transaction using a short-range communication radio. The method reduces the
cognitive burden on a user when making a payment transaction, thereby creating a more efficient
human-machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling a user to make a
payment transaction faster and more efficiently conserves power and increases the time between
battery charges.
[0234]          Multifunction device 100 (and device 300) may include near field
communications circuitry. Accordingly, device 100 can wirelessly communicate with external
equipment, such as NFC-enabled contactless payment transaction terminal 2000, using near field
communications. The contactless payment transaction terminal 2000 may be part of a payment
system (e.g., check register) installed in a retail store for processing payment transactions, such
as purchases of products and services. For example, the near field communications circuitry in
                                                    60

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
device 100 may include a near field transmitter and a near field receiver. Near field
communications for device 100 may be supported using capacitive coupling near field
communications structures and/or inductive coupling near field communications structures. In
near field communications techniques, wireless signals are typically conveyed, for example, over
distances of 1 m or less, 100 cm or less, 10 cm or less, or 1 cm or less, and are not conveyed over
longer distances.
[0235]           At block 802, in some embodiments, the electronic device receives authorization
(e.g., from the user, as described in detail below) to proceed with a payment transaction prior to
detecting presence of a field (e.g., an NFC compliant RF field 2002 of FIG. 7A) generated by the
contactless payment transaction terminal (e.g., 2000 of FIG. 7A). The authorization is only valid
for a predetermined period of time (e.g., up to 30 seconds). If the user places the device into the
field after receiving authorization and before the predetermined period of time has elapsed, the
device will proceed with the payment transaction (e.g., a payment of funds being solicited by the
contactless payment transaction terminal 2000 of FIG. 7A). After the predetermined period of
time has elapsed, the device will no longer have authorization to proceed with the payment
transaction (unless the user authorizes the device again), and accordingly the device will not
proceed with the payment transaction, even if placed within range of the field. Thus, the device
does not stay authorized indefinitely after receiving authorization to proceed with a payment
transaction. In some embodiments, the device may not receive authorization to proceed with the
payment transaction prior to detecting presence of the field generated by the contactless payment
transaction terminal.
[0236]           At block 804, the electronic device detects, by the short-range communication
radio of the electronic device, presence of the field (e.g., the NFC compliant RF field 2002 of
FIG. 7B) generated by the contactless payment transaction terminal (e.g., an NFC-compliant
payment transaction terminal 2000 of FIG. 7B).
[0237]           At block 806, in response to detecting presence of the field generated by the
contactless payment transaction terminal, the device determines whether authorization to proceed
with a payment transaction is provided. For example, the device determines whether the device
has been pre-authorized by the user (e.g., prior to the device detecting the field) for proceeding
with payment transactions or whether the user is currently authorizing the device to proceed with
the payment transaction (e.g., the user has placed a finger on a fingerprint sensor for
authorization).

    WO 2015/184353                                                            PCT/US2015/033326
[0238]           At block 808, in some embodiments, while the device is within range of the field
generated by the contactless payment transaction terminal, the device detects a respective
fingerprint on a fingerprint sensor of the electronic device. In response to detecting the
respective fingerprint on the fingerprint sensor, the device determines whether the fingerprint is
consistent with an enrolled fingerprint that is enabled to authorize payment transactions. In
accordance with a determination that a respective fingerprint is consistent with the enrolled
fingerprint, the device authorizes the payment transaction. For example, a user places their
finger on the fingerprint sensor of the device (e.g., without turning on the display of the device or
opening any particular application) and then places the device into the field. When the device
detects the field, the device reads the fingerprint and determines that the user has provided
authorization to make a payment using the device. In accordance with a determination that the
respective fingerprint is not consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device forgoes
authorization of the payment transaction. In other words, the device is not authorized to proceed
with the payment transaction, meaning authorization is still required to proceed with the payment
transaction.
[0239]           In some embodiments, the user interface of the electronic device is locked when
presence of the field generated is detected and the display of the electronic device is off when
presence of the field generated is detected. In response to detecting the presence of the field
generated by the contactless payment transaction terminal, the device turns the display on.
[0240]           At block 810, in some embodiments, in response to detecting presence of the field
generated by the contactless payment transaction terminal, the device displays an electronic
wallet (e.g., as illustrated in FIG. 7C and/or if the device is placed in range of the field while the
device is unlocked). The electronic wallet includes a plurality of payment card affordances (such
as payment card affordances 704 and 708 of FIG. 7C).
[0241]           At block 812, in accordance with a determination that authorization to proceed
with the payment transaction has been provided (e.g., the user provided authorization prior to
entering the field or the user provides authorization while the device is in the field), the device
proceeds with the payment transaction with the contactless payment transaction terminal (e.g.,
transmitting an identifier such as a PAN to the contactless payment transaction terminal for use
in completing the payment transaction).
[0242]           In some embodiments, proceeding with the payment transaction with the
contactless payment transaction terminal 2002 comprises using a linked payment account (e.g., a
payment account linked to the electronic device and stored in an electronic wallet) to complete
                                                    62

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
the payment transaction. In some embodiments, proceeding with the payment transaction with
the contactless payment transaction terminal comprises using a primary account number for use
in the payment transaction (e.g., using the credit account to make the purchase) to complete the
payment transaction, where the primary account number is stored on the electronic device.
[0243]          At block 814, in some embodiments, in accordance with the determination that
authorization to proceed with the payment transaction has been provided, the device determines
whether the payment transaction is successfully completed. In response to determining the
payment transaction is successfully completed, the device plays, at the electronic device, a
success audio alert. The success audio alert indicates that the payment transaction is successfully
completed. In some embodiments, the success audio alert is different than a failure audio alert.
[0244]          Similarly, providing non-audio notifications to the user of the device is helpful for
the user to understand whether additional input is required. At block 814, in some embodiments,
in accordance with the determination that authorization to proceed with the payment transaction
has been provided (e.g., the device is armed), the device determines whether the payment
transaction is successfully completed. In response to determining the payment transaction is
successfully completed, the device causes a success haptic alert indicating that the payment
transaction is successfully completed. In one example, the success haptic alert is different than a
failure haptic alert. For example, the failure haptic alert is longer in duration and more intense
than the success haptic alert.
[0245]          At block 816, in accordance with a determination that authorization to proceed
with the payment transaction has not been provided (e.g., the device is not armed), and at block
818 the device provides an indication requesting authorization to proceed with the payment
transaction. For example, the indication may be display of a fingerprint visual indicator (e.g.,
710A of FIG. 7C) on the display or the indication may be producing a haptic alert at the device
(or both the visual indicator and the haptic alert). These indications requesting authorization to
proceed with the payment transaction provide an intuitive user interface to let the user know that
the contactless payment transaction terminal 2000 is capable of processing (or is attempting to
process) a payment transaction using the device.
[0246]          In some embodiments, the indication requesting authorization to proceed with the
payment transaction includes detecting, by the short-range communication radio, whether the
device continues to be in the presence of the field 2002. In response to detecting that the device
does not continue to be in the presence of the field, the device displays, on the display, a visual
indicator indicating that authentication has failed or has not been provided). The visual indicator
                                                  63

    WO 2015/184353                                                             PCT/US2015/033326
is helpful because the user may be looking at the device while the device is not in the field 2002.
In response to detecting that the device continues to be in the presence of the field, causing, at
the electronic device, a non-visual alert (e.g., haptic or audio alert) indicating that authentication
has failed (or has not been provided). The non-visual alert is helpful because the user may not be
looking at the display when the device is in the field 2002. In some embodiments, a similar
approach is used to indicate success of the authentication. When the device is out of the field,
the user is likely able to easily look at the display, whereas when the device is in the field, the
user is not likely to be able to easily look at the display, thus providing a non-visual alert when
the device is in the field provides a more intuitive user interface for the device.
[0247]           In some embodiments, providing an indication requesting authorization to
proceed with the payment transaction includes displaying, on the display, instruction (e.g.,
prompt user to authenticate using fingerprint reader, 710A of FIG. 7C) for authorizing to proceed
with the payment transaction. In some embodiments, providing an indication requesting
authorization to proceed with the payment transaction comprises causing, at the electronic
device, a haptic alert instead of, or in addition to, the instruction for authorizing to proceed with
the payment transaction.
[0248]           In some embodiments, providing the indication requesting authorization to
proceed with the payment transaction comprises displaying an authorization request screen on
the display of the electronic device. The authorization request screen includes a graphical
representation (e.g., 704 of FIG. 7C) of the credit card associated with the payment account, and
the graphical representation (e.g., 704 of FIG. 7C) includes the background image of the credit
card associated with the payment account. In some embodiments, the graphical representation
(e.g., 704 of FIG. 7C) also includes other information identifying the credit card associated with
the payment account, such as a name of the credit card holder, a credit card number from the
physical credit card (even if the credit card number from the physical credit card is different
from the account number linked to the device), and/or an expiration date.
[0249]           At block 820, in some embodiments, after detecting the presence of the field
generated by the contactless payment transaction terminal when authorization to proceed with
the payment transaction has not been provided (e.g., the user has not provided authorization to
the device), the device detects, by the short-range communication radio, that the device is no
longer in range of the field generated by the contactless payment transaction terminal. In
response to detecting that the device is no longer in range of the field (e.g., the user is not
holding the device over the contactless payment transaction terminal), the device displays a
plurality of payment card affordances (e.g., payment card affordances 704 and 708 of FIG. 7C)
                                                    64

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
associated with different payment accounts. The device receives authorization to proceed with
the payment transaction for a predetermined period of time with one of the payment accounts
(e.g., in response to detecting a user input selecting a "pay with this payment account" option in
a displayed representation of a payment account).
[0250]           At block 822, in some embodiments, the device provides an indication that a
default payment card affordance (e.g., 704 of FIG. 7C) of the plurality of payment card
affordances (e.g., 704 and 708 of FIG. 7C) is selected as a default payment account. The default
primary account number associated with the default payment card affordance is selected for use
in the payment transaction (e.g., when the user does not select a different payment account for
use in the payment transaction). In some embodiments, different payment accounts are assigned
as the default payment account based on current environmental factors, such as the current day
of month, time of day, and/or location. In some embodiments, different payment accounts are
assigned as the default card based on the budget available on one or more payment accounts.
For example, a payment account that has reached a maximum budget (or has reached a threshold
based on the maximum budget) will not be used as the default payment account.
[0251]           At block 824, in some embodiments, the device receives the selection (e.g., a
finger tap) of the alternate payment card affordance of the plurality of payment card affordances
(e.g., 704 and 708 of FIG. 7C), where the alternate payment card affordance is associated with a
respective alternate primary account number. In response to receiving the selection of the
alternate payment card affordance, the device selects the respective alternate primary account
number for use in the payment transaction (rather than the default primary account number).
[0252]           At block 826, in some embodiments, in accordance with the determination that
authorization to proceed with the payment transaction has not been provided, the device receives
authorization (e.g., receiving a passcode for payment or detecting a fingerprint for payment) to
proceed with a payment transaction for a predetermined period of time (e.g., up to 30 seconds).
For example, the user places the device into the field and is prompted to provide authorization,
as discussed above. The user then removes the device from the field and provides authorization
using the fingerprint sensor or a passcode. The authorization is valid for a predetermined period
of time (e.g., 30 seconds). If the user places the device into the field before the predetermined
period of time has elapsed, the device will proceed with the payment transaction. After the
predetermined period of time has elapsed, the device will no longer have authorization to
proceed with the payment transaction (unless the user authorizes the device again), and
accordingly the device will not proceed with the payment transaction. Thus, the device does not
stay authorized indefinitely after receiving authorization to proceed with a payment transaction.
                                                   65

    WO 2015/184353                                                            PCT/US2015/033326
[0253]           As discussed above, in some embodiments, authorization to proceed with the
payment transaction can be provided through a fingerprint sensor (e.g., 702 of FIG. 7D). At
block 830, the device detects a respective fingerprint on a fingerprint sensor of the electronic
device. In response to detecting the respective fingerprint on the fingerprint sensor, the device
determines that the fingerprint is consistent with an enrolled fingerprint that is enabled to
authorize payment transactions. In accordance with a determination that a respective fingerprint
is consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device authorizes the payment transaction.
[0254]           In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the respective
fingerprint is not consistent with the enrolled fingerprint (e.g., authentication using the
fingerprint sensor has failed), the device displays, on the display, a visual prompt (e.g., 712 of
FIG. 7E) instructing a user to place a finger on the fingerprint sensor.
[0255]           In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the respective
fingerprint is not consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device displays, on the display, an
affordance (e.g., 714 of FIG. 7E) for receiving authorization to proceed with the payment
transaction using a payment passcode (rather than the fingerprint sensor). The device also
indicates to the user that authentication has failed by, for example, providing visual prompt (e.g.,
712 of FIG. 7E). If the device receives selection of the affordance for receiving authorization,
the device displays a keypad (e.g., 740 of FIG. 7L) for receiving a payment passcode entry.
[0256]           In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the respective
fingerprint is not consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device plays, at the electronic
device, a failure audio alert through a speaker. The failure audio alert indicates that
authorization to proceed with the payment transaction has not been provided. Providing an audio
notification to the user of the device of the status (or state) of the technique is helpful for the user
to understand whether additional input is required.
[0257]           In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the respective
fingerprint is not consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device causes a failure haptic alert
indicating that authorization to proceed with the payment transaction has not been provided. The
haptic feedback is particularly helpful to the user if the user has placed the device into the field
and is not looking at the display.
[0258]           In some embodiments, the electronic device determines whether a predetermined
number of attempts to receive authorization to proceed with the payment transaction using the
fingerprint sensor has been reached. In accordance with a determination that the predetermined
number of attempts to receive authorization has been reached, the device requires authorization
                                                   66

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
using a payment passcode to proceed with the payment transaction (e.g., the user interface of
FIG. 7L). For example, the predetermined number of attempts is three. Thus, after the third
failed attempt to authorize using the fingerprint sensor, the device requires authorization using a
payment passcode to proceed with the payment transaction.
[0259]           As discussed above, authorization to proceed with the payment transaction can be
provided through receiving a payment passcode. In some embodiments, the device receives a
payment passcode at the electronic device. The device determines that the payment passcode is
consistent with an enrolled passcode that is enabled to authorize payment transactions. In
response to determining that the payment passcode is consistent with the enrolled passcode (e.g.,
a passcode programmed by the user for unlocking the device or for making payments), the
device authorizes the payment transaction. For example, authorization can be received using a
payment passcode when authorization using the fingerprint sensor has failed.
[0260]           In some embodiments, the predetermined period of time is based on a current
location of the electronic device. For example, when the device determines that the current
location is at a department store, the predetermined period of time may be set to 15 seconds. In
another example, when the device determines that the current location is a concert or theater
venue, the predetermined period of time may be set to 45 seconds. This may, for example, help
to accommodate delays such as standing in line or making a purchase decision. Having a
predetermined period of time that is based on the location may also help limit fraud.
[0261]           In some embodiments, the predetermined period of time is based on a credit score
associated with the payment account. For example, the predetermined period of time may be
based on creditworthiness. In one example, the predetermined period of time may be set to 30
seconds when the credit score associated with the payment account is above a threshold,
indicating good credit. In another example, the predetermined period of time may be set to 15
seconds when the credit score associated with the payment account is below a threshold,
indicating not good credit (e.g., poor credit). For example, a predetermined period of time that is
based on a credit score may help limit fraud.
[0262]           In some embodiments, the predetermined period of time is user-configurable. For
example, a user may decide that a longer predetermined period of time may be helpful in
proceeding with payment transactions. Thus, the user can increase the predetermined period of
time to value, such as 60 seconds, that is higher than the default value. For example, a
predetermined period of time that is user-configurable may help limit fraud.

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
[0263]          At block 832, in some embodiments, in response to receiving authorization to
proceed with the payment transaction, (e.g., through a passcode or a fingerprint sensor), the
device displays a graphical indication (e.g., 720A-720C of FIGS. 7H-7J) that authorization to
proceed has been provided. In some embodiments, the graphical indication includes an
indication to place the device in the field (e.g., an animated icon that shows a device moving to
indicate that the device needs to be moved to be placed in range of the field). This indicates to
the user that authorization to proceed with the payment transaction has been provided to the
electronic device, and that the user should place the electronic device into the field to proceed
with the payment transaction.
[0264]          At block 834, in some embodiments, in response to receiving authorization to
proceed with the payment transaction, the device proceeds with the payment transaction (e.g.,
processes the payment transaction using the NFC-enabled contactless payment transaction
terminal 2000 when the device is within range of the field 2002 and the authorization has not
expired).
[0265]          Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method 800
(e.g., FIGS. 8A-8B and 7A-70) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the methods
described below and above. For example, methods 600, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000,
and 2200 may include one or more of the characteristics of the various methods described above
with reference to method 800. For example, the payment transactions, authorizations, electronic
wallets, devices, alerts, and user interface elements described above with reference to method
800 optionally have one or more of the characteristics of payment transactions, authorizations,
electronic wallets, devices, alerts, and user interface elements described herein with reference to
other methods described herein. For brevity, these details are not repeated below.
[0266]          The operations described above with reference to the figures may be implemented
by components depicted in FIGS. 1A-lB. For example, display operations, detection operations,
and determination operations may be implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180,
and event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch
sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to
application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event
information to respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a first
location on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as
selection of an object on a user interface. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is
detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the
event or sub-event. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176 or object updater 177
                                                   68

to update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a
respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it would
be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be implemented
based on the components depicted in FIGS. lA-lB.
[0267]          FIGS. 9A-9H illustrate exemplary user interfaces for displaying transaction
information of a payment account in accordance with some embodiments. The user interfaces in
these figures are used to illustrate the processes described below, including the process in FIGS.
 10A-10B.
[0268]          FIGS. 9A-9C illustrate exemplary user interfaces for displaying details of a most
recent payment transaction in accordance with some embodiments. FIG. 9A illustrates an
exemplary user interface of an electronic device 100, including an electronic wallet. The
electronic wallet includes a respective representation of a payment account (e.g., a revolving
credit account held with a financial institution). The respective representation of the payment
account (e.g., a display showing the front of a credit card that is associated with the payment
account) includes first transaction information 950 (e.g., date, time, location of the transaction,
name of retailer, charge amount) for a first payment transaction associated with the payment
account. For example, the first payment transaction may be the most recent transaction
associated with the payment account. The first transaction information 950 includes, for
example, the date 912, time, and/or location of the first payment transaction. The first
transaction information 950 may also include the name of the retailer 910 associated with the
first payment transaction and an amount charged 914 for the first payment transaction. In some
embodiments, the first payment transaction was completed using the electronic device, such as
through an NFC payment transaction using the electronic device (e.g., as illustrated and
described in FIGS. 7A-70 and FIGS. 8A-8B) or a payment transaction using an application or
website accessed on the electronic device (e.g., as illustrated and described in FIGS. 11 A-1 IN
and FIGS. 12A-12C). In some embodiments, the first payment transaction was completed using
a physical credit card associated with the payment account (e.g., by swiping the credit card at a
payment terminal at a retail store). By displaying the first transaction information 950, a viewer
of the electronic wallet can quickly and efficiently appreciate the details of the most recent
transaction associated with the payment account.
[0269]          FIG. 9B illustrates an exemplary user interface for displaying information about a
subsequent payment transaction. The electronic device detects a second payment transaction
associated with the payment account using the electronic device. For example, the payment
transaction may be an NFC payment transaction using the electronic device (e.g., as illustrated
                                                   69

and described in FIGS. 7A-70 and FIGS. 8A-8B) or a payment transaction using an application
or website accessed on the electronic device (e.g., as illustrated and described in FIGS. 11 A-1IN
and FIGS. 12A-12C). In one example, the payment account is linked to the electronic device.
At block 1006, in response to detecting the second payment transaction, and prior to receiving
information about the second payment transaction from a financial institution involved in the
second transaction (e.g., the merchant or financial institution that processed the payment
transaction), the device displays at block 1008 second transaction information 960 (e.g., date,
time, location of the second payment transaction) for the second payment transaction. The
second transaction information 960 is based on information locally available to the electronic
device. For example, information locally available to the electronic device comprises one or
more of a date 922 of the second payment transaction, a time 922 of the second payment
transaction, or a location 924 of the electronic device when the second payment transaction was
detected. In one example, the second transaction information 960 is based exclusively on
information locally available to the electronic device prior to receiving information about the
second payment transaction from a financial institution involved in the second transaction.
[0270]           In some embodiments, display of the second transaction information 960 (e.g.,
date, time, location of the second payment transaction) for the second payment transaction
replaces the display of the first transaction information 950 (e.g., date, time, location of the
transaction, name of retailer, charge amount of the first payment transaction). In other words,
displaying the second transaction information 960 for the second payment transaction comprises
replacing display of the first transaction information 950 with display of the second transaction
information 960.
[0271]           FIG. 9C illustrates updating the second transaction information 960. In some
embodiments, the electronic device receives first additional information 926 (e.g., the amount of
the second payment transaction) about the second payment transaction from an intermediary
institution involved in the second transaction. The intermediary institution may be, for example,
the institution that provides the operating system of the electronic device or provides the
electronic wallet software application of the electronic device. In some embodiments, the first
additional information 926 includes a monetary amount of the second payment transaction (e.g.,
$425.00). In response to receiving the first additional information 926 about the second payment
transaction from the intermediary institution involved in the second transaction, the electronic
device updates the second transaction information 960 for the second payment transaction to
include the first additional information 926 about the second payment transaction. Thus, the user
interface allows the user to easily and efficiently determine the date, time, location, and/or

amount of the most recent detected payment transaction associated with the payment account
(e.g., the second payment transaction).
[0272]           FIG. 9D illustrates further updating the second transaction information 960. In
some embodiments, the electronic device receives second additional information (e.g., dollar
amount, name of merchant 920) about the second payment transaction from the financial
institution involved in the second transaction (e.g., the bank or the merchant). In response to
receiving the second additional information 920 about the second payment transaction from the
financial institution involved in the second transaction, the device updates display of the second
transaction information 920 for the second payment transaction to include the second additional
information 920 about the second payment transaction. In some embodiments, the second
transaction information is updated when the electronic wallet is refreshed (e.g., by reloading the
electronic wallet application or by reopening the electronic wallet application after it has been
closed). In some embodiments, the second additional information 920 about the second payment
transaction comprises the name of the retailer receiving payment as a result of the second
payment transaction.
[0273]           In some embodiments, the electronic device displays an available credit amount
(e.g., how much more can be charged to the account before a credit limit for the account will be
reached, or how much more can be charged to the account before a user-specified budget for the
account is reached) on the respective representation of the payment account. For example, the
available credit amount indicates the amount of credit available on the payment account based on
a credit limit of the payment account. Displaying the available credit amount allows the user to
efficiently determine how much more money can be spent using the payment account.
[0274]           FIG. 9E illustrates an exemplary user interface for displaying a message from the
financial institution. In some embodiments, the respective representation of the payment account
includes a message from the financial institution. The electronic device receives a textual
message 916 from the financial institution and displays the textual message from the financial
institution on the respective representation of the payment account. For example, the message
may be an offer for the user or a notification relating to the payment account. The electronic
device receives selection of the displayed textual message (e.g., user activates the textual
message by tapping on the message), and, in response to receiving selection of the displayed
textual message, the device displays a particular application (e.g., the financial institution's
banking application) associated with the financial institution. For example, the user taps on the
textual message 916 and the electronic device displays the particular software application related
to the financial institution.

[0275]          FIGS. 9F-9G illustrate exemplary user interfaces for displaying the details of
transactions of a payment account. In one embodiment, the electronic device displays an
account detail affordance 906 on the respective representation of the payment account. The
electronic device receives selection of the account detail affordance 906 FIG. 9F, and, in
response to receiving selection of the transactions detail affordance 906, the electronic device
substitutes display of the respective representation of the payment account for display of
transactions details 930 (e.g., the device displays the back of the representation of the payment
account to reveal payment history and additional details) of the payment account, as illustrated in
FIG. 9G. The transactions details 930 include the first transaction information 950 and the
second transaction information 960. For example, the user taps on transactions detail affordance
906 and the electronic device displays a historical list of transactions for the payment account.
[0276]          In some embodiments, the transactions details 930 includes a more-transactions
affordance 954. The electronic device receives selection of the more-transactions affordance
954, and, in response to receiving selection of the more-transactions affordance, the device
displays a third transaction information associated with a third payment transaction associated
with the payment account as part of the displayed transactions details 930 (e.g., the device
displays more (or older) transactions for the payment account).
[0277]          In some embodiments, the transactions details 930 includes a remove-card
affordance 958. The electronic device receives selection of the remove-card affordance, and, in
response to receiving selection of the remove-card affordance 958, the electronic device displays
a confirmation request for removing the respective representation of the payment account from
the electronic wallet. The device receives a confirmation to remove the respective representation
of the payment account from the electronic wallet (e.g., the user activates an affordance
confirming that the payment account should be removed). The electronic device removes the
respective representation of the payment account from the electronic wallet (e.g., after receiving
the confirmation). Thus, a user can initiate the process to remove the link between the electronic
device and a payment account by tapping on the remove-card affordance 958.
[0278]          FIGS. 9G-9H illustrate exemplary user interfaces for accessing a particular
application associated with the payment account. In some embodiments, transactions details 930
includes an open-application affordance 934 for accessing a particular application or a
download-application affordance for downloading and installing the particular application. The
electronic device determines whether a particular application (e.g., a software application
associated with the payment account, such as a banking application) for accessing details of the
associated payment account is installed on the electronic device. In accordance with a

determination that the particular application is installed, the electronic device displays open
application affordance 934 for accessing (such as starting or displaying) the particular
application. In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the particular
application is not installed, the electronic device displays a download-application affordance
(e.g. in place of the open-application affordance 934) for downloading and installing the
particular application on the electronic device. In some embodiments, the electronic device
receives a selection of the open-application affordance 934 (e.g., a finger tap on the open
application affordance 934), and, in response to receiving selection of the open-application
affordance 934, the electronic device completely replaces display of the transactions details 930
with display of the particular application, as illustrated in FIG. 9H. For example, if a user taps
the open-application affordance 934, the particular application is displayed. If a user taps the
download-application affordance, the particular application is downloaded or a user interface for
downloading the particular application is displayed.
[0279]           FIGS. 9G-9H also illustrate exemplary user interfaces for accessing a particular
application associated with the payment account for viewing details of a particular payment
transaction. In one embodiment, the electronic device receives selection of the first transaction
information 950 of the displayed transactions details 930, and, in response to receiving selection
of the first transaction information 950, the electronic device completely replaces display of the
transactions details 930 with display of the particular application 970, as shown in FIG. 9H. The
display of the particular application 970 includes details 972 about the first payment transaction
associated with the payment account.
[0280]           In some embodiments, the displayed electronic wallet includes display of a first
stack of card objects and a second stack of card objects, the first stack of card objects visually
separated from the second stack of card objects. The first stack of card objects comprises the
respective representation of the payment account and a second respective representation of a
second payment account. The second stack of card objects comprises a membership card object
associated with a non-financial institution (e.g., grocery store membership cards, gym
membership cards, coffee store discount cards).
[0281]           FIGS. 10A-OB are flow diagrams illustrating method 1000 for displaying
transaction information of a payment account in accordance with some embodiments. Method
 1000 is performed at a device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or portable multifunction device 100,
Figure 1) with a display. Some operations in method 1000 may be combined, the order of some
operations may be changed, and some operations may be omitted.

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
[0282]           As described below, method 1000 provides an intuitive way for displaying
transaction information of a payment account. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a
user when accessing the transaction information, thereby creating a more efficient human
machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling a user access transaction
information faster and more efficiently conserves power and increases the time between battery
charges.
[0283]           At block 1002, the electronic device displays an electronic wallet comprising a
respective representation of a payment account (e.g., a revolving credit account held with a
financial institution). The respective representation of the payment account (e.g., a display
showing the front of a credit card that is associated with the payment account) includes first
transaction information (e.g., 950 of FIG. 9A; a date, time, location of the transaction, name of
retailer, charge amount) for a first payment transaction associated with the payment account. For
example, the first payment transaction may be the most recent transaction associated with the
payment account. The first transaction information (e.g., 950 of FIG. 9A) includes, for example,
the date (e.g., 912 of FIG. 9A), time, and/or location of the first payment transaction. The first
transaction information may also include the name of the retailer (e.g., 910 of FIG. 9A)
associated with the first payment transaction and an amount charged (e.g., 914 of FIG. 9A) for
the first payment transaction. In some embodiments, the first payment transaction was
completed using the electronic device, such as through an NFC payment transaction using the
electronic device (e.g., as illustrated and described in FIGS. 7A-70 and FIGS. 8A-8B) or a
payment transaction using an application or website accessed on the electronic device (e.g., as
illustrated and described in FIGS. 11 A-1 IN and FIGS. 12A-12C). In some embodiments, the
first payment transaction was completed using a physical credit card associated with the payment
account (e.g., by swiping the credit card at a payment terminal at a retail store). By displaying
the first transaction information, a viewer of the electronic wallet can quickly and efficiently
appreciate the details of the most recent transaction associated with the payment account.
[0284]           At block 1004, the electronic device detects a second payment transaction
associated with the payment account using the electronic device. For example, the payment
transaction may be an NFC payment transaction using the electronic device (e.g., as illustrated
and described in FIGS. 7A-70 and FIGS. 8A-8B) or a payment transaction using an application
or website accessed on the electronic device (e.g., as illustrated and described in FIGS. 11 A- I1N
and FIGS. 12A-12C). In one example, the payment account is linked to the electronic device.
[0285]           At block 1006, in response to detecting the second payment transaction, and prior
to receiving information about the second payment transaction from a financial institution
                                                   74

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
involved in the second transaction (e.g., the merchant or financial institution that processed the
payment transaction), the device displays second transaction information (e.g., 960 of FIG. 9B; a
date, time, location of the second payment transaction) for the second payment transaction. The
second transaction information is based on information locally available to the electronic device.
For example, information locally available to the electronic device comprises one or more of a
date of the second payment transaction, a time of the second payment transaction, or a location
of the electronic device when the second payment transaction was detected. In one example, the
second transaction information is based exclusively on information locally available to the
electronic device prior to receiving information about the second payment transaction from a
financial institution involved in the second transaction.
[0286]           At block 1010, in some embodiments, display of the second transaction
information (e.g., date, time, location of the second payment transaction) for the second payment
transaction replaces the display of the first transaction information (e.g., date, time, location of
the transaction, name of retailer, charge amount of the first payment transaction). In other
words, displaying the second transaction information (e.g., 960 of FIG. 9B) for the second
payment transaction comprises replacing display of the first transaction information (e.g., 950 of
FIG. 9A) with display of the second transaction information.
[0287]           At block 1012, in some embodiments, the electronic device receives first
additional information (e.g., 926 of FIG. 9C) the amount of the second payment transaction)
about the second payment transaction from an intermediary institution involved in the second
transaction. The intermediary institution may be, for example, the institution that provides the
operating system of the electronic device or provides the electronic wallet software application
of the electronic device. In some embodiments, the first additional information (e.g., 926 of FIG.
9C) includes a monetary amount of the second payment transaction (e.g., $425.00). In response
to receiving the first additional information about the second payment transaction from the
intermediary institution involved in the second transaction, the electronic device updates the
second transaction information (e.g., 960 of FIG. 9C) for the second payment transaction to
include the first additional information about the second payment transaction. Thus, the user
interface allows the user to easily and efficiently determine the date, time, location, and/or
amount of the most recent detected payment transaction associated with the payment account
(e.g., the second payment transaction).
[0288]           At block 1014, in some embodiments, the electronic device receives second
additional information (e.g., dollar amount, name of merchant 920 of FIG. 9D) about the second
payment transaction from the financial institution involved in the second transaction (e.g., the
                                                   75

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
bank or the merchant). In response to receiving the second additional information (e.g., 920 of
FIG. 9D) about the second payment transaction from the financial institution involved in the
second transaction, the device updates display of the second transaction information for the
second payment transaction to include the second additional information about the second
payment transaction. In some embodiments, the second transaction information is updated when
the electronic wallet is refreshed (e.g., by reloading the electronic wallet application or by
reopening the electronic wallet application after it has been closed). In some embodiments, the
second additional information (e.g., 920 of FIG. 9D) about the second payment transaction
comprises the name of the retailer receiving payment as a result of the second payment
transaction.
[0289]          At block 1016, in some embodiments, the electronic device displays an available
credit amount (e.g., how much more can be charged to the account before a credit limit for the
account will be reached, or how much more can be charged to the account before a user
specified budget for the account is reached) on the respective representation of the payment
account. For example, the available credit amount indicates the amount of credit available on the
payment account based on a credit limit of the payment account. Displaying the available credit
amount allows the user to efficiently determine how much more money can be spent using the
payment account.
[0290]          In some embodiments, the respective representation of the payment account
includes a message from the financial institution. The electronic device receives a textual
message (e.g., 916 of FIG. 9E) from the financial institution and displays the textual message
from the financial institution on the respective representation of the payment account. For
example, the message may be an offer for the user or a notification relating to the payment
account. The electronic device receives selection of the displayed textual message (e.g., user
activates the textual message by tapping on the message), and, in response to receiving selection
of the displayed textual message, the device displays a particular application (e.g., the financial
institution's banking application) associated with the financial institution. For example, the user
taps on the textual message (e.g., 916 of FIG. 9E) and the electronic device displays the
particular software application related to the financial institution.
[0291]          In one embodiment, at block 1018, the electronic device displays an account
detail affordance (e.g., 906 of FIG. 9F) on the respective representation of the payment account.
The electronic device receives selection of the account detail affordance (e.g., 906 of FIG. 9F),
and, in response to receiving selection of the transactions detail affordance (e.g., 906 of FIG. 9F),
the electronic device substitutes display of the respective representation of the payment account

for display of transactions details (e.g., 930 of FIG. 9G; the device displays the back of the
representation of the payment account to reveal payment history and additional details) of the
payment account, as illustrated in exemplary FIG. 9G. The transactions details (e.g., 930 of FIG.
9G) include the first transaction information (e.g., 950 of FIG. 9G) and the second transaction
information (e.g., 960 of FIG. 9G). For example, the user taps on transactions detail affordance
906 and the electronic device displays a historical list of transactions for the payment account.
[0292]           In some embodiments, the transactions details (e.g., 930 of FIG. 9G) comprises a
more-transactions affordance (e.g., 954 of FIG. 9G). The electronic device receives selection of
the more-transactions affordance (e.g., 954 of FIG. 9G), and, in response to receiving selection
of the more-transactions affordance, the device displays a third transaction information
associated with a third payment transaction associated with the payment account as part of the
displayed transactions details (e.g., the device displays more (or older) transactions for the
payment account).
[0293]           In some embodiments, the transactions details (e.g., 930 of FIG. 9G) comprises a
remove-card affordance (e.g., 958 of FIG. 9G). The electronic device receives selection of the
remove-card affordance, and, in response to receiving selection of the remove-card affordance,
the electronic device displays a confirmation request for removing the respective representation
of the payment account from the electronic wallet. The device receives a confirmation to
remove the respective representation of the payment account from the electronic wallet (e.g., the
user activates an affordance confirming that the payment account should be removed). The
electronic device removes the respective representation of the payment account from the
electronic wallet (e.g., after receiving the confirmation). Thus, a user can initiate the process to
remove the link between the electronic device and a payment account by tapping on the remove
card affordance.
[0294]           In some embodiments, transactions details (e.g., 930 of FIG. 9G) comprises an
open-application affordance (e.g., 934 of FIG. 9G) for accessing a particular application or a
download-application affordance for downloading and installing the particular application. The
electronic device determines whether a particular application (e.g., a software application
associated with the payment account, such as a banking application) for accessing details of the
associated payment account is installed on the electronic device. In accordance with a
determination that the particular application is installed, the electronic device displays open
application affordance for accessing (such as starting or displaying) the particular application. In
some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the particular application is not
installed, the electronic device displays a download-application affordance (e.g. in place of the

open-application affordance) for downloading and installing the particular application on the
electronic device. In some embodiments, the electronic device receives a selection of the open
application affordance (e.g., a finger tap on the open-application affordance), and, in response to
receiving selection of the open-application affordance, the electronic device completely replaces
display of the transactions details with display of the particular application, as illustrated in FIG.
9H. For example, if a user taps the open-application affordance (e.g., 934 of FIG. 9G), the
particular application is displayed. If a user taps the download-application affordance, the
particular application is downloaded or a user interface for downloading the particular
application is displayed.
[0295]           In one embodiment, the electronic device receives selection of the first transaction
information (e.g., 950 of FIG. 9G) of the displayed transactions details (e.g., 930 of FIG. 9G),
and, in response to receiving selection of the first transaction information (e.g., 950 of FIG. 9G),
the electronic device completely replaces display of the transactions details (e.g., 930 of FIG.
9G) with display of the particular application (e.g., 970 of FIG. 9H), as shown in FIG. 9H. The
display of the particular application (e.g., 970 of FIG. 9H) includes details (e.g., 972 of FIG. 9H)
about the first payment transaction associated with the payment account.
[0296]           In some embodiments, the displayed electronic wallet comprises display of a first
stack of card objects and a second stack of card objects, the first stack of card objects visually
separated from the second stack of card objects. The first stack of card objects comprises the
respective representation of the payment account and a second respective representation of a
second payment account. The second stack of card objects comprises a membership card object
associated with a non-financial institution (e.g., grocery store membership cards, gym
membership cards, coffee store discount cards).
[0297]           Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method 1000
(e.g., FIGS. 10A-OB and 9A-9H) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the methods
described below and above. For example, methods 600, 800, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000, and
2200 may include one or more of the characteristics of the various methods described above with
reference to method 1000. For example, the electronic wallets, payment accounts, transaction
information, transactions, devices, institutions, affordances, and other user interface elements

[0298]           The operations described above with reference to the figures may be implemented
by components depicted in FIGS. 1A-lB. For example, display operations, detection operations,
and receive operations may be implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event
handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive display
 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to application 136-1. A
respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event information to
respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a first location on the
touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as selection of an
object on a user interface. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is detected, event
recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the event or sub
event. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176 or object updater 177 to update the
application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a respective
GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it would be clear to a
person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be implemented based on the
components depicted in FIGS. lA-lB.
[0299]           FIGS. 11 A-1 IN illustrate exemplary user interfaces for making a payment
transaction in accordance with some embodiments. The user interfaces in these figures are used
to illustrate the processes described below, including the process in FIGS. 12A-12C.
[0300]           FIGS. 11 A- 11 B illustrate exemplary user interfaces for initiating a payment
transaction in accordance with some embodiments. At FIG. 11 A, an electronic device 100
displays a user interface for a first application 1102 (e.g., a third-party merchant application or a
web browser-accessed website). The user interface for the first application 1102 includes a
payment affordance 1110 (e.g., a submit button to buy contents of a shopping cart) associated
with a payment transaction (e.g., a purchase to be made). For example, the payment affordance
 1110 may be a submit button to initiate the purchase of the contents of an electronic shopping
cart 1104. In this example, the electronic shopping cart 1104 includes multiple clothing items
 1106. In some embodiments, the first application is a third-party application installed on the
electronic device. In some embodiments, the first application includes a website accessed
through a web browser installed on the electronic device.
[0301]           The electronic device detects selection of the payment affordance 1110 (e.g., a
user taps the payment affordance 1110). In response to detecting selection of the payment
affordance 1110, the electronic device transfers first transaction information (e.g., descriptions of
items in the shopping cart, item prices, tax, subtotal, shipping method details) about the payment
transaction from the first application 1102 (e.g., a third-party merchant application or a web

browser-accessed website) to a second application (e.g., operating system or electronic wallet
application).
[0302]           In some embodiments, the second application is the operating system of the
electronic device, and the second application has access to an electronic wallet (e.g., the
electronic wallet illustrated and described above with respect to FIGS. 5A-5I, FIGS. 6A-6C,
FIGS. 9A-9H, and FIGS. 10A-OB) including second transaction information. In some
embodiments, the second application is a first-party application provided by a provider of the
operating system of the electronic device, and the second application has access to an electronic
wallet (e.g., the electronic wallet illustrated and described above with respect to FIGS. 5A-5I,
FIGS. 6A-6C, FIGS. 9A-9H, and FIGS. 10A-OB) including second transaction information.
[0303]           At FIG. 1 IB, in response to detecting selection of the payment affordance 1110,
the electronic device displays a user interface for the second application 1120. The user
interface for the second application 1120 includes the first transaction information (e.g.,
descriptions of items in the shopping cart, item prices, tax, subtotal 1132, shipping method
details) received from the first application and includes second transaction information (e.g.,
indication of payment account 1124, name associated with the payment account, billing address,
ship-to address 1126, and contact information 1130) provided by the second application (e.g.,
operating system or electronic wallet application). The second transaction information is not
available to the first application (e.g., the user has not provided the third-party application with
credit card, billing address, shipping address, or contact information).
[0304]           In some embodiments, displaying the user interface for the second application
1120 (e.g., operating system or electronic wallet application) partially covers the user interface
for the first application 1102 (e.g., a third-party merchant application or a web browser-accessed
website), leaving at least part of the user interface for the first application 1102 visible. The
second application only partially covers the user interface for the first application so as to help
the user to maintain context for the transaction. For example, in FIG. 1 IB, the user interface for
the second application 1120 (which, for example, includes displayed items 1124, 1126, 1128,
1130, 1124A, 1126A, 1128A, 1130A, 1132, 1134, 1136, 1138, and 1150) covers the bottom
portion of the display of device 100, leaving the top portion of the user interface for the first

user interface for the second application 1120 (e.g., operating system or electronic wallet
application) onto the display from the bottom of the display to partially cover the user interface
for the first application 1102 (e.g., a third-party merchant application or a web browser-accessed
website) and leaving at least part of the user interface for the first application 1102 visible. The
second application only partially covers the user interface for the first application so as to help
the user to maintain context for the transaction. For example, in the transition between FIGS.
 11 A and 1 iB, the user interface for the second application 1120 (which, for example, includes
displayed items 1124, 1126, 1128, 1130, 1124A, 1126A, 1128A, 1130A, 1132, 1134, 1136,
 1138, and 1150) slides up from the bottom of the display of the device to cover the bottom
portion of the display of device 100, leaving the top portion of the user interface for the first
application 1102 visible, including part of the electronic shopping cart 1104 and one of the
clothing items 1106 (e.g., the navy blue shirt for $85.00).
[0306]           In some embodiments, the first transaction information includes an amount 1108
(e.g., a subtotal for the shopping cart or the total amount to be paid) and a default shipping
method 1128 (e.g., a shipping method such as two-day express mail, first class, ground shipping
selected by the first application). In some embodiments, the second transaction information
includes a primary account number 1124 (e.g., account number stored in an electronic wallet)
associated with a payment account. For example, the payment account may be a payment
account linked to the electronic device, as described above. In some embodiments, the second
transaction information includes a ship-to address 1126 (e.g., the user's home mailing address)
accessed from user contact information, wherein the user contact information is stored on the
electronic device.
[0307]           FIGS. 1 IC- I1D illustrate exemplary user interfaces for changing an option of the
payment transaction in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, the
electronic device receives a selection of (e.g., user taps on) a first purchase detail affordance
(e.g., caret associated with payment account 1124A, shipping address, shipping method, contact
information) displayed on the user interface for the second application 1120. The first purchase
detail affordance 1124A is associated with a first purchase detail (e.g., the selected payment
account, shipping address, shipping method, contact information) of the payment transaction. In
response to receiving selection of the first purchase detail affordance 1124A, the device displays
one or more affordances (e.g., displays different options for payment accounts) for selecting an
alternate value for the first purchase detail of the payment transaction. For example, when a user
selects caret 1 124A in FIG. 1 IC, which relates to a payment account for the first purchase detail,
the device displays, as illustrated in FIG. 1 ID, several payment account options 1160 and 1162
                                                   81

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
for the first purchase detail. The currently selected payment account option 1160 is identified,
such as by checkmark 1164. The device receives a selection of an alternate value (e.g., the user
selects payment account option 1162) for the first purchase detail of the payment transaction,
and, in response to receiving selection of the alternate value, the device updates the second
transaction information to include the alternate value as the first purchase detail. Thus, the user
can change the default payment account 1124 that will be used for the payment transaction.
[0308]           Similarly, the user can use caret 1 126A associated with shipping address, caret
1128A associated with shipping method, or caret 1 130A associated with contact info to change a
corresponding purchase detail. For example, a user may change the default shipping address
1126 to that of a work location, rather than the default shipping address of a home location. In
another example, the user may change the default shipping method 1128 to a different shipping
method offered by the first application. In another example, the user may change the default
contact info 1130 to a different email address.
[0309]           In some embodiments, the first purchase detail (e.g., price, default shipping
option) of the payment transaction is part of the first transaction information from the first
application. In some embodiments, the first purchase detail (e.g., payment account, shipping
address, shipping method, contact information) is part of the second transaction information. In
some embodiments, the first purchase detail is a shipping address. In another embodiment, the
first purchase detail is a payment account.
[0310]           In some embodiments, the electronic device transfers zip code information from
the second application to the first application. In some embodiments, the zip code information is
transferred before the transaction has been authorized, so as to enable the device to provide more
accurate shipping cost information to the user before the user decides to authorize the
transaction. The first transaction information includes an initial shipping cost based on the zip
code information. The device (or the second application) receives updated first transaction
information, wherein the updated first transaction information includes a shipping cost based on
the second transaction information (e.g., the shipping cost is updated based on the user's actual
selected shipping address).
[0311]           FIGS. 1 IE-IL illustrate exemplary user interfaces for receiving authentication to
proceed with a payment transaction in accordance with some embodiments. In some
embodiments, the electronic device receives authorization (e.g., receiving a passcode for
payment or detecting a fingerprint for payment) to proceed with the payment transaction.

    WO 2015/184353                                                             PCT/US2015/033326
[0312]          FIGS. I1E-F illustrate exemplary user interfaces for receiving authentication to
proceed with a payment transaction using a fingerprint sensor 702 of the electronic device in
accordance with some embodiments. At FIG. 11 E, the device displays a visual indicator 1 150A
instructing the user to provide authentication using fingerprint sensor 702. In some
embodiments, receiving authorization to proceed with the payment transaction uses the
fingerprint sensor 702. The device detects a respective fingerprint on a fingerprint sensor 702 of
the electronic device. In response to detecting the respective fingerprint on the fingerprint sensor
702, the device determines whether the fingerprint is consistent with an enrolled fingerprint that
is enabled to authorize payment transactions. In accordance with a determination that a
respective fingerprint is consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device authorizes the
payment transaction. In accordance with a determination that the respective fingerprint is not
consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the devices forgoes authorization of the payment
transaction. In other words, the device does not authorize the payment transaction, meaning
authorization is still required to proceed with the payment transaction.
[0313]          FIG. 1 IF illustrates display of a partially filled visual indicator 1150B, showing
the progress of determining whether the fingerprint is consistent with the enrolled fingerprint.
FIG. 1 iG illustrates an exemplary user interface when fingerprint authentication fails. In some
embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the respective fingerprint is not consistent
with the enrolled fingerprint, the device displays, on the display, an affordance 1154 for
receiving authorization to proceed with the payment transaction using a payment passcode
(rather than the fingerprint sensor). In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination
that the respective fingerprint is not consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, displaying, on the
display, a visual prompt 1150A instructing a user to place a finger on the fingerprint sensor.
[0314]          FIG. 11H illustrates an exemplary user interface for authentication using the
fingerprint sensor after one or more failed attempts at authenticating using the fingerprint sensor.
In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the respective fingerprint is not
consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device determines whether a predetermined number
of attempts to receive authorization to proceed with the payment transaction using the fingerprint
sensor has been reached. In accordance with a determination that the predetermined number of
attempts to receive authorization has been reached, the device requires authorization using a
payment passcode to proceed with the payment transaction, such as illustrated in FIG. I1L. In
some embodiments, the predetermined number of attempts is three.
[0315]          FIGS. 1 IK-L illustrate various exemplary user interfaces for entry of a payment
passcode in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, receiving authorization
                                                   83

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
to proceed with the payment transaction comprises receiving authorization using a payment
passcode. The device receives a payment passcode at the electronic device (e.g., using keypad
740 of FIG. 1 IL). The device determines whether the payment passcode is consistent with an
enrolled passcode that is enabled to authorize payment transactions. In response to determining
that the payment passcode is consistent with the enrolled passcode (e.g., a passcode programmed
by the user for unlocking the device or for making payments), the device authorizes the payment
transaction. For example, at FIG. 1 1K, pay with passcode affordance 1164 is displayed. A user
selects the pay with passcode affordance 1164 in order to provide authorization using a payment
passcode. After receiving selection of the pay with passcode affordance 1164, the device
displays a (e.g., keypad 740 of FIG. 1 IL) for receiving the payment passcode. The user enters
the payment passcode to provide authorization.
[0316]           FIG. 111 illustrates an exemplary user interface for indicating authorization has
been received. The device displays a done affordance 1156, indicating that authorization to
proceed with the payment transaction has been received. In some embodiments, in response to
receiving authorization to proceed with the payment transaction, the electronic device transfers
the second transaction information to the first application. In some embodiments, the second
transaction information is provided to the first application without providing the first application
with access to other similar information that is accessible to the second application, such as the
user's contacts, payment account information, or shipping information. For example, only the
specific payment account information or shipping information that the user selected to provide to
the first application for use in processing the current payment transaction is provided to the first
application.
[0317]           In some embodiments, the electronic device receives authorization (e.g., receiving
a passcode for payment or detecting a fingerprint for payment) to proceed with the payment
transaction. In response to receiving authorization to proceed with the payment transaction, the
electronic device transfers the first transaction information and the second transaction
information to the first application.
[0318]           In some embodiments, the electronic device receives the authorization (e.g.,
receiving a passcode for payment or detecting a fingerprint for payment) to proceed with the
payment transaction prior to transferring the second transaction information to the first
application. The second transaction information is not provided to the first application before the
authorization to proceed with the application has been received, so as to protect the privacy of
the user. The privacy of the user is protected because the first application (e.g., the third-party
                                                   84

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
application) cannot access the sensitive information in the second transaction information
without the user's consent (e.g., through authorizing to proceed with the payment transaction).
[0319]           FIG. 11J illustrates an exemplary user interface for a completed payment
transaction. In some embodiments, in response to transferring the first transaction information
and the second transaction information from the second application to the first application, the
device completes the payment transaction. The first application displays, for example, a
confirmation that the transaction has been completed, such as illustrated in FIG. 11J. The
confirmation that the transaction has been completed may include, for example, the total amount
paid and a confirmation number 1162.
[0320]           In some embodiments, a financial institution associated with processing the
payment transaction treats the payment transaction as a card-present transaction. The financial
institution treats the payment transaction as a card-present transaction, as compared to a card
not-present transaction, even though there is no physical credit card being swiped at the time of
purchase. The financial institution treats the payment transaction as a card-present transaction
because the payment transaction was completed securely. For example, the payment transaction
is completed securely because the payment account has been linked to the respective device and
completing the payment transaction requires user authorization (such as through the fingerprint
sensor or passcode entry). As a result of these extra layers of security, the financial institution
has confidence that the primary account number used in the payment transaction was provided
by the device linked to the payment account.
[0321]           In some embodiments, a third application can be used to commence a second
payment transaction using the electronic wallet. The device displays a user interface for the third
application (e.g., a third-party merchant application or a different web browser-accessed
website). The third application is different from the first application and the second application.
The user interface for the third application includes a second payment affordance (e.g., a submit
button to buy contents of a shopping cart in the third-party merchant application or the web
browser accessed website). The second payment affordance is associated with a second payment
transaction (e.g., another purchase to be made using the second application). The electronic
device detects selection of (e.g., the user taps on) the second payment affordance, and, in
response to detecting selection of the second payment affordance, the electronic device transfers
third transaction information (e.g., description of items in cart, item prices, tax, subtotal,
shipping method details) about the second payment transaction from the third application to the
second application. The electronic device displays a second user interface for the second
application, wherein the second user interface for the second application includes the third
                                                  85

transaction information received from the third application and includes fourth transaction
information (e.g., payment account information, name on the payment account, billing address,
ship-to address, and/or contact information) provided by the second application (e.g., operating
system or electronic wallet application). The fourth transaction information is not available to
the third application. For example, the fourth transaction information is not available to the third
application because the user has not previously provided the third application with the payment
account information, name on the payment account, billing address, ship-to address, and/or
contact information.
[0322]          FIGS. 11 M- 11 N illustrate exemplary user interfaces for configuring the settings
of an electronic wallet in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, the
electronic device displays a settings menu 1170. The electronic device receives selection of a
default shipping address to be used as a default for the second transaction information. For
example, the user selects caret 1184, which relates to a ship-to address. The user can then enter
(and thus the electronic device receives) an entry for a default ship-to address (e.g., default
shipping address) for use with payment transactions.
[0323]          In some embodiments, the electronic device receives selection from among at
least the payment account 1174 and a second payment account 1176 displayed in the settings
menu 1170. The selection specifies the default payment account to be used for payment
transactions. The selection determines the default payment account that will be used for
payment transactions.
[0324]          In some embodiments, the electronic device receives input for default contact
information. The input specifies the default contact information to be used for payment
transactions. For example, the user selects caret 1186, which relates to contact information. The
user can then enter (and thus the electronic device receives) a preferred contact information. The
entry determines the default contact information that will be used for payment transactions.
[0325]          FIG. 1 IN illustrates an exemplary user interface for configuring the settings of an
electronic wallet in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, the electronic
device receives selection of a transaction history display preference (e.g., the transaction history
preference switch 1192) displayed in a settings menu 1170. The electronic device determines
whether the transaction history display preference is enabled, and, in accordance with a
determination that the transaction history display preference is enabled, the device displays a
history of payment transactions 1194. For example, the history of payment transactions 1194
may include multiple previously completed payment transactions 1196, 1197, and 1198. In
                                                 86

another embodiment, when the electronic device receives selection of the more-transaction
affordance 1199, the device displays additional previously completed payment transactions.
[0326]           In some embodiments, the electronic device receives selection of a transaction
history type preference. The transaction history type preference is displayed in the settings
menu. The electronic device determines whether the transaction history type preference is a first
type, a second type, or a third type. In accordance with a determination that the transaction
history type preference is the first type, the electronic device does not display a history of
payment transactions for a payment account. In accordance with a determination that the
transaction history type preference is the second type, the electronic device displays a history of
payment transactions for the payment account completed using only the electronic device. Thus,
for example, payment transactions associated with the same payment account, but which were
completed using another device or a physical credit card are not displayed when the transaction
history type preference is the second type. In accordance with a determination that the
transaction history type preference is the third type, the electronic device displays a history of
payment transactions for the payment account completed using the electronic device and a
physical credit card.
[0327]           FIGS. 12A-12C are flow diagrams illustrating a method for making a payment
transaction in accordance with some embodiments. Method 1200 is performed at a device (e.g.,
device 300, Figure 3, or portable multifunction device 100, Figure 1) with a display. Some
operations in method 1200 may be combined, the order of some operations may be changed, and
some operations may be omitted.
[0328]           As described below, method 1200 provides an intuitive way for making a
payment account. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when making the payment
transaction, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated
computing devices, enabling a user to make a payment transaction faster and more efficiently
conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.
[0329]           At block 1202, an electronic device displays a user interface for a first application
(e.g., a third-party merchant application or a web browser-accessed website, 1102 of FIG. 11 A).
The user interface for the first application (e.g., 1102 of FIG. 11 A) includes a payment
affordance (e.g., a submit button to buy contents of a shopping cart, 1110 of FIG. 11 A)
associated with a payment transaction (e.g., a purchase to be made). For example, the payment
affordance (e.g., 1110 of FIG. 11 A) may be a submit button to initiate the purchase of the
contents of an electronic shopping cart (e.g., 1104 of FIG. 11 A).

[0330]            At block 1204, in some embodiments, the first application is a third-party
application installed on the electronic device. At block 1206, in some embodiments, the first
application includes a website accessed through a web browser installed on the electronic device.
[0331]            At block 1208, the electronic device detects selection of the payment affordance
(e.g., a user taps the payment affordance 1110 of FIG. 11 A).
[0332]            At block 1210, the device performs operations in response to detecting selection
of the payment affordance (e.g., 1110 of FIG. 11A). At block 1212, the electronic device
transfers first transaction information (e.g., descriptions of items in the shopping cart, item
prices, tax, subtotal, shipping method details) about the payment transaction from the first
application (e.g., a third-party merchant application or a web browser-accessed website, 1102 of
FIG. 11 A) to a second application (e.g., operating system or electronic wallet application).
[0333]            At block 1214, in some embodiments, the second application is the operating
system of the electronic device, and the second application has access to an electronic wallet
(e.g., the electronic wallet illustrated and described above with respect to FIGS. 5A-51, FIGS.
6A-6C, FIGS. 9A-9H, and FIGS. 10A-OB) including second transaction information.
[0334]            At block 1216, in some embodiments, the second application is a first-party
application provided by a provider of the operating system of the electronic device, and the
second application has access to an electronic wallet (e.g., the electronic wallet illustrated and
described above with respect to FIGS. 5A-51, FIGS. 6A-6C, FIGS. 9A-9H, and FIGS. 10A-OB)
including second transaction information.
[0335]            At block 1218, in response to detecting selection of the payment affordance (e.g.,
1110 of FIG. 11 A), the electronic device displays a user interface for the second application
(e.g., 1120 of FIG. 11B). The user interface for the second application (e.g., 1120 of FIG. 11B)
includes the first transaction information (e.g., descriptions of items in the shopping cart, item
prices, tax, subtotal, shipping method details) received from the first application and includes
second transaction information (e.g., indication of payment account, name associated with the
payment account, billing address, ship-to address, and contact information) provided by the
second application (e.g., operating system or electronic wallet application). The second
transaction information is not available to the first application (e.g., the user has not provided the
third-party application with credit card, billing address, shipping address, or contact
information).
[0336]            At block 1220, in some embodiments, displaying the user interface for the second
application (e.g., operating system or electronic wallet application, 1120 of FIG. 1 IB) partially

covers the user interface for the first application (e.g., a third-party merchant application or a
web browser-accessed website, 1102 of FIG. 11B), leaving at least part of the user interface for
the first application visible. The second application only partially covers the user interface for
the first application so as to help the user to maintain context for the transaction.
[0337]           At block 1222, in some embodiments, displaying the user interface for the second
application (e.g., operating system or electronic wallet application, 1120 of FIG. 11B) comprises
vertically sliding the user interface for the second application (e.g., operating system or
electronic wallet application, 1120 of FIG. 1 IB) onto the display from the bottom of the display
to partially cover the user interface for the first application (e.g., a third-party merchant
application or a web browser-accessed website, 1102 of FIG. 11B) and leaving at least part of
the user interface for the first application visible. The user interface for the second application
only partially covers the user interface for the first application so as to help the user to maintain
context for the transaction.
[0338]           In some embodiments, the first transaction information includes an amount (e.g.,
a subtotal for the shopping cart or the total amount to be paid) and a default shipping method
(e.g., a shipping method such as two-day express mail, first class, ground shipping selected by
the first application). In some embodiments, the second transaction information includes a
primary account number (e.g., account number stored in an electronic wallet) associated with a
payment account. For example, the payment account may be a payment account linked to the
electronic device, as described above. In some embodiments, the second transaction information
includes a ship-to address (e.g., the user's home mailing address) accessed from user contact
information, wherein the user contact information is stored on the electronic device.
[0339]           At block 1224, in some embodiments, the electronic device receives a selection of
(e.g., user taps on) a first purchase detail affordance (e.g., caret associated with payment account,
shipping address, shipping method, contact information) displayed on the user interface for the
second application (1120 of FIG. 1 IC). The first purchase detail affordance (1 124A of FIG.
 1 IC) is associated with a first purchase detail (e.g., the selected payment account, shipping
address, shipping method, contact information) of the payment transaction. In response to
receiving selection of the first purchase detail affordance (1 124A of FIG. 1 IC), the device
displays one or more affordances (e.g., displays different options for payment accounts) for
selecting an alternate value for the first purchase detail of the payment transaction. The device
receives a selection of an alternate value (e.g., the user selects payment account option 1162) for
the first purchase detail of the payment transaction, and, in response to receiving selection of the
alternate value, the device updates the second transaction information to include the alternate
                                                    89

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
value as the first purchase detail. Thus, the user can change the default payment account that
will be used for the payment transaction.
[0340]           At block 1226, in some embodiments, the first purchase detail (e.g., price, default
shipping option) of the payment transaction is part of the first transaction information from the
first application.
[0341]           At block 1228, in some embodiments, the first purchase detail (e.g., payment
account, shipping address, shipping method, contact information) is part of the second
transaction information. In some embodiments, the first purchase detail is a shipping address. In
some embodiments, the first purchase detail is a payment account.
[0342]           In some embodiments, the electronic device transfers zip code information from
the second application to the first application. In some embodiments, the zip code information is
transferred before the transaction has been authorized, so as to enable the device to provide more
accurate shipping cost information to the user before the user decides to authorize the
transaction. The first transaction information includes an initial shipping cost based on the zip
code information. The device (or the second application) receives updated first transaction
information, wherein the updated first transaction information includes a shipping cost based on
the second transaction information (e.g., the shipping cost is updated based on the user's actual
selected shipping address).
[0343]           At block 1230, in some embodiments, the electronic device receives authorization
(e.g., receiving a passcode for payment or detecting a fingerprint for payment) to proceed with
the payment transaction.
[0344]           At block 1232, in some embodiments, receiving authorization to proceed with the
payment transaction uses the fingerprint sensor. The device detects a respective fingerprint on a
fingerprint sensor of the electronic device. In response to detecting the respective fingerprint on
the fingerprint sensor, the device determines whether the fingerprint is consistent with an
enrolled fingerprint that is enabled to authorize payment transactions. In accordance with a
determination that a respective fingerprint is consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device
authorizes the payment transaction. In accordance with a determination that the respective
fingerprint is not consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device forgoes authorization of the
payment transaction. In other words, the device does not authorize the payment transaction,
meaning authorization is still required to proceed with the payment transaction.
[0345]           In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the respective
fingerprint is not consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device displays, on the display, an
                                                  90

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
affordance (e.g., 1154 of FIG. 1 IG) for receiving authorization to proceed with the payment
transaction using a payment passcode (rather than the fingerprint sensor). In some embodiments,
in accordance with a determination that the respective fingerprint is not consistent with the
enrolled fingerprint, displaying, on the display, a visual prompt (e.g., 1150A of FIG. 1 IG)
instructing a user to place a finger on the fingerprint sensor.
[0346]           In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the respective
fingerprint is not consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device determines whether a
predetermined number of attempts to receive authorization to proceed with the payment
transaction using the fingerprint sensor has been reached. In accordance with a determination
that the predetermined number of attempts to receive authorization has been reached, the device
requires authorization using a payment passcode to proceed with the payment transaction. In
some embodiments, the predetermined number of attempts is three.
[0347]           At block 1234, in some embodiments, receiving authorization to proceed with the
payment transaction comprises receiving authorization using a payment passcode. The device
receives a payment passcode at the electronic device (e.g., using keypad 740 of FIG. 1 IL). The
device determines whether the payment passcode is consistent with an enrolled passcode that is
enabled to authorize payment transactions. In response to determining that the payment
passcode is consistent with the enrolled passcode (e.g., a passcode programmed by the user for
unlocking the device or for making payments), the device authorizes the payment transaction.
[0348]           At block 1236, in some embodiments, the device performs a series of operations
in response to receiving authorization to proceed with the payment transaction. At block 1238,
in some embodiments, the electronic device transfers the second transaction information to the
first application. In some embodiments, the second transaction information is provided to the
first application without providing the first application with access to other similar information
that is accessible to the second application, such as the user's contacts, payment account
information, or shipping information. For example, only the specific payment account
information or shipping information that the user selected to provide to the first application for
use in processing the current payment transaction is provided to the first application.
[0349]           At block 1240, in some embodiments, in response to receiving authorization to
proceed with the payment transaction, the electronic device transfers the first transaction
information and the second transaction information to the first application.
[0350]           In some embodiments, the electronic device receives the authorization (e.g.,
receiving a passcode for payment or detecting a fingerprint for payment) to proceed with the
                                                  91

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
payment transaction prior to transferring the second transaction information to the first
application. The second transaction information is not provided to the first application before the
authorization to proceed with the application has been received so as to protect the privacy of the
user. The privacy of the user is protected because the first application (e.g., the third-party
application) cannot access the sensitive information in the second transaction information
without the user's consent (e.g., through authorizing to proceed with the payment transaction).
[0351]          In some embodiments, in response to transferring the first transaction information
and the second transaction information from the second application to the first application, the
device completes the payment transaction.
[0352]          At block 1242, in some embodiments, a financial institution associated with
processing the payment transaction treats the payment transaction as a card-present transaction.
The financial institution treats the payment transaction as a card-present transaction, as compared
to a card-not-present transaction, even though there is no physical credit card being swiped at the
time of purchase. The financial institution treats the payment transaction as a card-present
transaction because the payment transaction was completed securely. For example, the payment
transaction is completed securely because the payment account has been linked to the respective
device and completing the payment transaction requires user authorization (such as through the
fingerprint sensor or passcode entry). As a result of these extra layers of security, the financial
institution has confidence that the primary account number used in the payment transaction was
provided by the device linked to the payment account.
[0353]          At block 1244, in some embodiments, a third application can be used to
commence a second payment transaction using the electronic wallet. The device displays a user
interface for the third application (e.g., a third-party merchant application or a different web
browser-accessed website). The third application is different from the first application and the
second application. The user interface for the third application includes a second payment
affordance (e.g., a submit button to buy contents of a shopping cart in the third-party merchant
application or the web-browser accessed website). The second payment affordance is associated
with a second payment transaction (e.g., another purchase to be made using the second
application). The electronic device detects selection of (e.g., the user taps on) the second
payment affordance, and, in response to detecting selection of the second payment affordance,
the electronic device transfers third transaction information (e.g., description of items in cart,
item prices, tax, subtotal, shipping method details) about the second payment transaction from
the third application to the second application. The electronic device displays a second user
interface for the second application, wherein the second user interface for the second application
                                                    92

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
includes the third transaction information received from the third application and includes fourth
transaction information (e.g., payment account information, name on the payment account,
billing address, ship-to address, and/or contact information) provided by the second application
(e.g., operating system or electronic wallet application). The fourth transaction information is
not available to the third application. For example, the fourth transaction information is not
available to the third application because the user has not previously provided the third
application with the payment account information, name on the payment account, billing
address, ship-to address, and/or contact information.
[0354]          In some embodiments, the electronic device displays a settings menu (e.g., 1170
of FIG. 11M). The electronic device receives selection of a default shipping address to be used
as a default for the second transaction information.
[0355]          In some embodiments, the electronic device receives selection from among at
least the payment account (e.g., 1174 of FIG. 1 IM) and a second payment account (e.g., 1176 of
FIG. 1 IM) displayed in the settings menu (e.g., 1170 of FIG. 1 IM). The selection specifies the
default payment account to be used for payment transactions. The selection determines the
default payment account that will be used for payment transactions.
[0356]          In some embodiments, the electronic device receives input for default contact
information. The input specifies the default contact information to be used for payment
transactions.
[0357]          In some embodiments, the electronic device receives selection of a transaction
history display preference (e.g., the transaction history preference switch 1192 of FIG. 1 IN)
displayed in a settings menu (e.g., 1170 of FIG. 1 IN). The electronic device determines whether
the transaction history display preference is enabled, and, in accordance with a determination
that the transaction history display preference is enabled, the device displays a history of
payment transactions (e.g., 1194 of FIG. 1 IN). For example, the history of payment transactions
(e.g., 1194 of FIG. 1 IN) may include multiple previously completed payment transactions (e.g.,
 1196, 1197, and 1198 of FIG. 1 IN). In another embodiment, when the electronic device
receives selection of the more-transaction affordance (e.g., 1199 of FIG. 1 IN), the device
displays additional previously completed payment transactions.
[0358]          In some embodiments, the electronic device receives selection of a transaction
history type preference. The transaction history type preference is displayed in the settings
menu. The electronic device determines whether the transaction history type preference is a first
type, a second type, or a third type. In accordance with a determination that the transaction
                                                  93

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
history type preference is the first type, the electronic device does not display a history of
payment transactions for a payment account. In accordance with a determination that the
transaction history type preference is the second type, the electronic device displays a history of
payment transactions for the payment account completed using only the electronic device. Thus,
for example, payment transactions associated with the same payment account, but which were
completed using another device or a physical credit card are not displayed when the transaction
history type preference is the second type. In accordance with a determination that the
transaction history type preference is the third type, the electronic device displays a history of
payment transactions for the payment account completed using the electronic device and a
physical credit card.
[0359]          Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method 1200
(e.g., FIGS. 12A-12C and 11 A-I IN) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the methods
described above. For example, methods 600, 800, 1000, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000, and 2200 may
include one or more of the characteristics of the various methods described above with reference
to method 1200. For example, the applications, affordances, transaction information, electronic
wallets, transactions, purchase details, authorizations, institutions, devices, and user interface
elements described above with reference to method 1200 optionally have one or more of the
characteristics of applications, affordances, transaction information, electronic wallets,
transactions, purchase details, authorizations, institutions, devices, and user interface elements
described herein with reference to other methods described herein. For brevity, these details are
not repeated below.
[0360]          The operations in the information processing methods described above may be
implemented by running one or more functional modules in information processing apparatus
such as general purpose processors or application specific chips. These modules, combinations
of these modules, and/or their combination with general hardware (e.g., as described above with
respect to FIGS. 1A, lB and 3) are all included within the scope of protection of the invention.
[0361]          The operations described above with reference to the figures may be implemented
by components depicted in FIGS. 1A-lB. For example, detection operations, display operations,
and determination operations may be implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180,
and event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch
sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to
application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event
information to respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a first
location on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as
                                                   94

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
selection of an object on a user interface. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is
detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the
event or sub-event. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176 or object updater 177
to update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a
respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it would
be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be implemented
based on the components depicted in FIGS. lA-lB.
[0362]           FIGS. 13A-13D illustrate exemplary user interfaces for selecting a payment
account from among available payment accounts using an electronic device in accordance with
some embodiments. The user interfaces in these figures are used to illustrate the processes
described below, including the process in FIG. 14.
[0363]           FIGS. 13A- 13B illustrate an exemplary technique for providing payment for a
payment transaction. In these examples, the payment is providing using a short-range
communication radio, such as a NFC radio. The NFC standards, which are related to radio
frequency identification (RFID) standards, describe communication protocols for transferring
information between two devices, such as for making payments. It should be appreciated,
however, that other communications standards and techniques may also be used.
[0364]           Device 100 (and device 300) may include near field communications circuitry,
such as a short range communication radio. Accordingly, device 100 can wirelessly
communicate with external equipment, such as NFC-enabled contactless payment transaction
terminal 1300, using near field communications.
[0365]           In FIG. 13A, the NFC-enabled contactless payment transaction terminal 1300
generates a field 1302. For example, an NFC-enabled device that enters the field 1302 can
communicate with the contactless payment transaction terminal 1300 using NFC. In FIG. 13A,
the electronic device 100 has not been placed in the field 1302. The contactless payment
transaction terminal 1300 may be part of a payment system (e.g., check register) installed in a
retail store for processing payment transactions, such as purchases of products and services.
[0366]           In FIG. 13B, the user places the electronic device 100 into the field 1302. The
electronic device detects, by the short-range communication radio of the electronic device,
presence of the field 1302 (e.g., the NFC compliant RF field) generated by the contactless
payment transaction terminal 1300 (e.g., an NFC-compliant payment transaction terminal). In
some embodiments, the electronic device detects the field and communication initiation signal
                                                  95

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
from the contactless payment transaction terminal 1300. The device communicates with the
contactless payment transaction terminal 1300 to authorize the payment transaction.
[0367]          In some embodiments, a user can make a purchase from any location where
access to a network, such as the Internet, is available. For example, a user can access a software
application at electronic device 100 with an Internet connection to initiate communication with a
remote payment processing terminal to make a payment in a payment transaction.
[0368]          In some embodiments, the electronic device is device 100. In some embodiments,
the electronic device is device 300. The device has a display (e.g., 112, 340), a processor (e.g.,
 120, 310), and memory (e.g., 102, 370) storing one or more programs for execution by the
processor.
[0369]          FIG. 13C illustrates an exemplary user interface that includes representations of a
plurality of payment accounts that are linked to the electronic device (e.g., 100). The plurality of
payment accounts includes a first payment account (e.g., 1304) and a second payment account
(e.g., 1306) that is different from the first payment account (e.g., 1304).
[0370]          The device receives a payment transaction request of a payment transaction,
wherein the first payment account (e.g., 1304) and the second payment account (e.g., 1306) are
both available to provide payment for the payment transaction. For example, the detection of the
field 1302 and/or the communication initiation signal may be a payment transaction request. For
another example, the payment transaction request is the user authorizing a payment. For another
example, the payment transaction request is a user activating an affordance for reviewing a
purchase summary (e.g., listing of items to be purchased and how payment will be made) prior to
authorizing the payment.
[0371]          In response to receiving the payment transaction request, the device obtains
payment account selection information (e.g., current location information, current time, currently
schedule calendar event). In accordance with a determination, based on the payment account
selection information, that first payment transaction criteria are met, the device provides
payment in the payment transaction using the first payment account (e.g., 1304). For example,
the device transmits the primary account number of a first credit card to a contactless payment
transaction terminal or to an online payment processor. In accordance with a determination,
based on the payment account selection information, that second payment transaction criteria are
met, the device provides payment in the payment transaction using the second payment account
(e.g., 1306). For example, the device transmits the primary account number of a second credit
card to a contactless payment transaction terminal or to an online payment processor.

    WO 2015/184353                                                         PCT/US2015/033326
[0372]           FIG. 13D illustrates an exemplary user interface displayed after payment has been
provided. In this example, the first payment transaction criteria were met. Accordingly, the
device provided payment in the payment transaction using the first payment account (e.g., 1304).
[0373]           In accordance with some embodiments, different payment accounts have different
primary account numbers. In accordance with some embodiments, the first payment account is
associated with a first primary account number and the second payment account is associated
with a second primary account number that is different than the first primary account number.
Providing payment in the payment transaction comprises using a respective primary account
number to authorize payment. For example, if the first payment account (e.g., 1304) is used, the
device transmits the first primary account number to the contactless payment transaction
terminal (1300) or to the online payment processor. For another example, if the second payment
account (e.g., 1306) is used, the device transmits the second primary account number to the
contactless payment transaction terminal (1300) or to the online payment processor.
[0374]           In accordance with some embodiments, the payment account selection
information comprises current location information of the electronic device. For example, the
device provides the first payment account (e.g., 1304) when the user of the device is in their
home country, and the device provides the second payment account (e.g., 1306) when the user of
the device is traveling through a second country. In some examples, this allows the device to
automatically select the appropriate payment account based on the location of the device, thereby
reducing the need for the user to navigate a complex user interface to select from among various
payment accounts.
[0375]           In accordance with some embodiments, the payment account selection
information comprises types of acceptable payment accounts. For example, the device provides
a primary American Express account when American Express cards are accepted. If American
Express cards are not accepted, then the device selects a primary Mastercard if Mastercard is
accepted. If both American Express and Mastercard are not accepted, the device selects a
primary Visa account if Visa cards are accepted.
[0376]           In accordance with some embodiments, the payment account selection
information comprises a time of day or day of week. For example, this allows the device to use a
personal credit card account for work expenses during the daytime of the work week and use a
personal credit card account for personal expenses in the evenings and on weekends.
[0377]           In accordance with some embodiments, the payment account selection
information comprises a currently scheduled electronic calendar event. For example, the device
                                                 97

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
uses a corporate credit card account during scheduled work events such as work lunches and
business trips and uses a personal credit card account at other times.
[0378]          In accordance with some embodiments, the payment account selection
information comprises identification of other devices within a defined proximity to the electronic
device. For example, when the user is at a restaurant and the user's spouse's phone is detected
within the defined proximity, the device uses a credit card or payment account associated with a
joint account. When the user is at a restaurant with a co-worker, supervisor, or subordinate, the
device uses a corporate credit card or payment account. When the user is at a restaurant without
any known contacts nearby, the device uses a personal credit card or payment account.
[0379]          In accordance with some embodiments, the payment account selection
information comprises identification of a retailer (or type of retailer) requesting the payment
transaction. For example, the device uses a first payment account (e.g., 1304) at a first retailer
and a second payment account (e.g., 1306) at a different retailer. For another example, the
device uses a credit card or payment account that is associated with automobile maintenance at a
gas station or auto repair shop and use a credit card or payment account that is associated with
grocery purchases at a grocery store.
[0380]          In accordance with some embodiments, the payment account selection
information comprises one or more items being purchased as part of the payment transaction.
For example, the device identifies the items being purchased and uses a first payment account
(e.g., 1304) for a purchase of gas at a gas station, and uses a second payment account (e.g., 1306)
for purchase of food at a different purchase transaction at the same gas station.
[0381]          In accordance with some embodiments, the payment account selection
information comprises one or more promotions associated with one or more of the payment
accounts. For example, a primary American Express account is selected when the device has
received information indicating that a promotional discount will be applied to purchases made
with an American Express card for certain types of purchases or for purchases made at certain
retailers.
[0382]          In accordance with some embodiments, the device provides a notification at the
electronic device (e.g., audio, haptic, or both) based on a met payment transaction criteria. The
notification indicates a respective payment account to be used for providing payment in the
payment transaction. For example, the device provides a custom haptic or audio alert for each
different payment account to alert the user as to which payment account has been selected. In

selects a payment account that is different from a default payment account. This notifies the user
that a payment account other than the default payment account will be used for the payment
transaction.
[0383]           In accordance with some embodiments, the first payment account is a default
payment account and the second payment account is different than the default payment account.
For example, the first payment transaction criteria include one or more criteria that are met when
there are no conditions that override the default payment account, and the second payment
transaction criteria include one or more criteria that are met when a condition overrides the
default payment account in favor of the second payment account.
[0384]           In accordance with some embodiments, the device receives identification of the
first payment account as a default payment account from an electronic wallet, wherein the
electronic wallet comprises representations of the plurality of payment accounts (e.g., 1304,
1306, 1308). For example, the device includes an electronic wallet application, which includes
information regarding the plurality of payment accounts and indicates which payment account of
the plurality of payment accounts is a default payment account.
[0385]           In accordance with some embodiments, the first payment account (e.g., 1304) is
associated with a first credit card and the second payment account (e.g., 1306) is associated with
a second credit card. For example, the first payment account (e.g., 1304) has been linked with a
first credit card from AA Bank such that payments made using the first payment account appear
on the same revolving credit bill as the first credit card from AA Bank.
[0386]           FIG. 14 is a flow diagram illustrating method 1400 for selecting a payment
account from among available payment accounts in accordance with some embodiments.
Method 1400 is performed at a device (e.g., 100, 300). The device has a display (e.g., 112, 340),
a processor (e.g., 120, 310), and memory (e.g., 102, 370) storing one or more programs for
execution by the processor. Some operations in method 1400 may be combined, the order of
some operations may be changed, and some operations may be omitted.
[0387]           As described below, method 1400 provides an intuitive way to select a payment
account from among available payment accounts when making a payment. The method reduces
the cognitive burden on a user when making a payment, thereby creating a more efficient
human-machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling make a payment
faster and more efficiently conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.

[0388]           At block 1402, a plurality of payment accounts are linked to the electronic device.
The plurality of payment accounts include a first payment account (e.g., 1304) and a second
payment account (e.g., 1306) that is different from the first payment account.
[0389]           At block 1404, a payment transaction request of a payment transaction is
received. The first payment account (e.g., 1305) and the second payment account (e.g., 1306)
are both available to provide payment for the payment transaction.
[0390]           At block 1406, in response to receiving the payment transaction request, payment
account selection information is obtained at block 1408 (e.g., current location information,
current time, currently schedule calendar event).
[0391]           At block 1410, in accordance with a determination, based on the payment account
selection information, that first payment transaction criteria are met, payment in the payment
transaction is provided using the first payment account (e.g., the device transmits the primary
account number of a first credit card to a contactless payment transaction terminal or to an online
payment processor).
[0392]           At block 1412, in accordance with a determination, based on the payment account
selection information, that second payment transaction criteria are met, payment in the payment
transaction is provided using the second payment account (e.g., the device transmits the primary
account number of a second credit card to a contactless payment transaction terminal or to an
online payment processor).
[0393]           Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method 1400
(e.g., FIGS. 14 and 13A-13D) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the methods
described below and above. For example, methods 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1600, 1800, 2000, and
2200 may include one or more of the characteristics of the various methods described above with
reference to method 1400. For example, the payment accounts, transactions, information,
criteria, devices, and user interface elements described above with reference to method 1400
optionally have one or more of the characteristics of payment accounts, transactions,
information, criteria, devices, and user interface elements described herein with reference to
other methods described herein. For brevity, these details are not repeated below.
[0394]           FIG. 15 illustrates an exemplary user interface for displaying an indication of a
digital item associated with a purchased item using an electronic device (e.g., 100, 300) in
accordance with some embodiments. The techniques and user interfaces in these figures are
used to illustrate the processes described below, including the process in FIG. 16.

    WO 2015/184353                                                           PCT/US2015/033326
[0395]           FIG. 15 illustrates an exemplary user interface indicating that a payment
transaction has been authorized for a purchased item (e.g., T1000 Video Game Console 1502).
The device (e.g., 100) authorizes a payment transaction for the purchased item (e.g., a good or a
real-world service) using a payment account (e.g., 1504) linked to the electronic device. The
purchased item is selected from the set comprising: a physical good and a real-world service.
For example, the user purchases a product (e.g., T1000 Video Game Console) at a retail store
(e.g., Tim's Toy Store) using near field communications. After authorizing the payment
transaction, the device determines that the purchased item is associated with a digital item (e.g., a
digital good or service; a controller software application for the T1000 Video Game Console),
wherein the digital item is different from the purchased item, and the device displays an
indication of the digital item (e.g., affordance 1506) that is associated with the purchased item.
For example, the processes described in relation to FIGS. 14 and 13A-13D can be used to
determine the payment account used to purchase of the product.
[0396]           In accordance with some embodiments, the digital item (the controller software
application) was not a part of the payment transaction (e.g., it was not purchased or licensed as
part of the payment transaction).
[0397]           In accordance with some embodiments, the payment transaction is authorized
based on communication (e.g., via NFC technology) with a payment terminal in a physical retail
location, such as a brick and mortar store, a concert venue, or other physical business.
[0398]           In accordance with some embodiments, displaying the indication of the digital
item includes displaying a prompt to download the digital item (e.g., prompt 1508). For
example, the device prompts the user to download an application for controlling a media
playback device that was purchased by the user. For another example, the device prompts the
user to install a concert venue application or to download to a document reader a map of a
concert venue when a concert ticket is purchased.
[0399]           In accordance with some embodiments, while displaying the prompt (e.g., 1508)
to download the digital item, the device detects selection of a confirmation affordance (e.g.,
affordance 1506). In response to detecting selection of the confirmation affordance (e.g., 1506),
the device downloads the digital item to the device. Optionally, the device also installs the
digital item on the device. For example, the device prompts the user to download an application
for controlling a media playback device that was purchased by the user. For another example,
the device prompts the user to install a concert venue application or to download to a document
reader a map of a concert venue if a concert ticket was purchased.

[0400]           In accordance with some embodiments, while displaying the prompt, the device
detects selection of a cancellation affordance (e.g., 1510). In response to detecting selection of
the cancellation affordance (e.g., 1510), the device forgoes downloading of the digital item to the
device. For example, the user indicates a preference to not download the digital item.
[0401]           In accordance with some embodiments, displaying the indication of the digital
item comprises downloading the digital item to the device. For example, the device downloads
an application for controlling a media playback device that was purchased by the user using the
electronic device, or the device downloads to a document reader a map of a concert venue if a
concert ticket was purchased using the electronic device.
[0402]           In accordance with some embodiments, the digital item is an advertisement or
coupon that is displayed on the display of the electronic device.
[0403]           In accordance with some embodiments, the indication of the digital item is
displayed in response to the authorization of the payment transaction that was completed by the
device (e.g., not in response to receiving a confirmatory communication from a retailer). For
example, the digital item is not a confirmation email or text message from the retailer. In
response to authorizing the payment transaction, the device generates a notification at the device
based on the payment transaction. For example, the notification is generated even where the
retailer does not have the capability to send a communication to the device, such as the retailer
not having an email address or phone number that is associated with the device.
[0404]           In accordance with some embodiments, the determination of the digital item that
is associated with the purchased item is based on information from a manufacturer of the
purchased item, and the manufacturer of the purchased item is different from a seller of the
purchased item.
[0405]           In accordance with some embodiments, the purchased item is a physical good and
the digital item is an application. For example, the application is configured to communicate
with the physical good, such as to electronically control the physical good.
[0406]           In accordance with some embodiments, the purchased item is an admission ticket
to an event at a venue and the digital item includes additional information about the venue (e.g.,
a map, schedule, etc.).
[0407]           FIG. 16 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 1600 for displaying an indication
of a digital item associated with a purchased item in accordance with some embodiments.
Method 1600 is performed at a device (e.g., 100, 300). The device has a display (e.g., 112, 340),
a processor (e.g., 120, 310), and memory (e.g., 102, 370) storing one or more programs for

execution by the processor. Some operations in method 1600 may be combined, the order of
some operations may be changed, and some operations may be omitted.
[0408]           As described below, method 1600 provides an intuitive way to display an
indication of a digital item associated with a purchased item. The method reduces the cognitive
burden on a user when making a purchase of an item that has an associated digital item, thereby
creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices,
enabling a user to view an indication of a digital item associated with a purchased item faster and
more efficiently conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.
[0409]           At block 1602, a payment transaction is authorized for a purchased item (e.g., a
good or a real-world service) using a payment account linked to the electronic device. The
purchased item is selected from the set comprising: a physical good and a real-world service
(e.g., the user purchases a product at a retail store using near field communications).
[0410]           After authorizing the payment transaction, at block 1604, it is determined that the
purchased item is associated with a digital item (e.g., a digital good or service). The digital item
is different from the purchased item.
[0411]           After authorizing the payment transaction, at block 1606, an indication of the
digital item (e.g., 1506) that is associated with the purchased item is displayed.
[0412]           Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method 1600
(e.g., FIGS. 15 and 16) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the methods described
below and above. For example, methods 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1800, 2000, and 2200 may
include one or more of the characteristics of the various methods described above with reference
to method 1600. For example, the payment accounts, transactions, authorizations, purchased
items, digital items, devices, indications, and user interface elements described above with
reference to method 1600 optionally have one or more of the characteristics of payment
accounts, transactions, authorizations, purchased items, digital items, devices, indications, and
user interface elements described herein with reference to other methods described herein. For
brevity, these details are not repeated below.
[0413]           FIGS. 17A- 17B illustrate exemplary user interfaces for initiating a payment
transaction with participants of an ongoing communication using an electronic device (e.g., 100,
300) in accordance with some embodiments. The user interfaces in these figures are used to
illustrate the processes described below, including the process in FIG. 18.
[0414]           In FIG. 17A, the device displays a user interface for a communication application
that includes a user interface indicative of ongoing communication (e.g., a phone call, a text or

    WO 2015/184353                                                          PCT/US2015/033326
multimedia messaging conversation 1702, an email thread) between a user of the device and one
or more other participants (e.g., 1704). For example, the one or more other participants may be
participants of a conversation in a messaging application, participants of an email in a mail
application, or participants of an event in a calendar application. The user interface for the
communication application includes a payment affordance (e.g., 1706). For example, the
payment affordance may indicate "Make Payment".
[0415]          While displaying the user interface indicative of the ongoing communication, the
device detects activation of the payment affordance (e.g., 1706). In response to detecting
activation of the payment affordance (e.g., 1706), the device initiates a payment transaction
between the user and the one or more other participants in the ongoing communication. In the
example of FIG. 17A, the only other participant in the ongoing message communication is M.
Smith. For example, the processes described in relation to FIGS. 14 and 13A-13D can be used
to determine the payment account used to initiate the payment transaction between the user and
the one or more other participants.
[0416]          In accordance with some embodiments, initiating the payment transaction
comprises transferring recipient information from the communication application to a second
application, wherein the recipient information identifies the one or more other participants in the
ongoing communication.
[0417]          As illustrated in FIG. 17B, in accordance with some embodiments, the device
displays a user interface for the second application (e.g., a payment processing application),
wherein the user interface for the second application (e.g., 1708) indicates the one or more other
participants (e.g., 1710) in the ongoing communication. The device proceeds with the payment
transaction using the second application (e.g., the payment processing application) and a
payment account linked to the electronic device.
[0418]          In accordance with some embodiments, the communication application and the
second application are different applications. In accordance with some embodiments, the user
interface for the communication application includes displayed representations of the one or
more other participants in the ongoing communication (e.g., 1704).
[0419]          In accordance with some embodiments, the payment transaction is initiated along
with another communication (e.g., a text message, email, or phone call).
[0420]          In accordance with some embodiments, initiating the payment transaction
comprises: determining the quantity of the one or more other participants; and in accordance
with a determination that the quantity of the one or more participants is one, enabling the user to

initiate the payment transaction without explicitly identifying the recipient of the payment. For
example, the device receives user input indicating an amount of the payment transaction and
forgoes receiving user input indicating recipients of the payment transaction. For example, the
device receives an input indicting the amount, but does not ask for recipients because there is
only one recipient-the one other participant.
[0421]           In accordance with some embodiments, initiating the payment transaction
comprises: determining the quantity of the one or more other participants, and in accordance
with a determination that the quantity of the one or more participants is greater than one,
requesting user input indicating an amount of the payment transaction and user input indicating
the one or more other participants are recipients of the payment transaction. For example, if there
are multiple participants, the user selects one or more of the participants for payment before
initiating the payment transaction.
[0422]           In accordance with some embodiments, the communication application is a
messaging application and the one or more other participants are participants of a displayed
conversation. In accordance with some embodiments, the communication application is an
electronic mail application and the one or more other participants are participants of a displayed
electronic mail. In accordance with some embodiments, the communication application is a
phone application and the one or more other participants are participants of an active phone
conversation. In accordance with some embodiments, the communication application is a
calendar application and the one or more other participants are invitees of a displayed calendar
event. In accordance with some embodiments, the communication application is a calendar
application and the one or more other participants are invitees of a displayed calendar event that
have accepted the displayed calendar event.
[0423]           In accordance with some embodiments, initiating the payment transaction
includes requesting user input indicating an amount of the payment transaction.
[0424]           In accordance with some embodiments, the one or more other participants are
within a defined proximity to the electronic device. For example, the device provides a quick
and easy way to send payments to members of a calendar invite who are currently at the
restaurant with the user (e.g., within a defined proximity), so "pay user" affordances are
displayed only for members of the calendar invite who are in close proximity to the user and not
for members of the calendar invite who are not in close proximity to the user.

[0432]            FIG. 19 illustrates an exemplary user interface for making a payment transaction
using an electronic device (e.g., 100, 300) in accordance with some embodiments. The user
interfaces are used to illustrate the processes described below, including the process in FIG. 20.
[0433]            The device displays a user interface (e.g., 1902) for a first application (e.g., map
application or web browser application that displays information about goods or services). The
user interface (e.g., 1902) for the first application includes information identifying a plurality of
retailers (e.g., 1904A-1904C for selecting items to purchase). The device receives a request to
initiate a payment transaction with a first retailer of the plurality of retailers (e.g., user taps on
the purchase selection affordance 1906). In response to receiving the request to initiate a
payment transaction with the first retailer: in accordance with a determination that an application
of the first retailer (e.g., an application designated by the first retailer for handling payment
transactions from mobile devices, such as an application that is branded with the brand of the
first retailer) is available on the device, the device invokes the application of the first retailer,
wherein the application of the first retailer enables the user to initiate a payment transaction with
the first retailer (e.g., the first retailer's application is displayed and provides options for making
the purchase), and in accordance with a determination that an application of the first retailer is
not available on the device, the device provides the user with an option for proceeding with the
payment transaction without invoking the application of the first retailer (e.g., a separate
application not provided by the retailer is invoked and provides options for making the
purchase).
[0434]            In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the application of
the first retailer is not available on the device and is available for download, the device displays a
download affordance (e.g., 1908) associated with the application of the retailer. For example,
the download affordance, when activated, initiates a download (and/or installation) of the
application of the first retailer to the electronic device.
[0435]            In accordance with some embodiments, the application of the first retailer is not
available when it is not installed on the device. For example, the application of the first retailer
is determined to be not available even if the application of the first retailer is available for

affordance (e.g., 1908) associated with the application of the retailer. The download affordance,
when activated, initiates a download (and/or installation) of the application of the first retailer to
the electronic device. In accordance with a determination that an application of the first retailer
is not available for download, the device provides the user with the option for proceeding with
the payment transaction without invoking an application of the retailer (e.g., a separate
application not provided by the retailer is invoked and provides options for making the
purchase).
[0437]           In accordance with some embodiments, providing the user with the option for
proceeding with the payment transaction without invoking an application of the first retailer
comprises: determining a type of the first retailer, selecting a first template from among a
plurality of templates based on the type of the first retailer, and displaying one or more items
(e.g., goods or services) of the first retailer using the selected first template.
[0438]           In accordance with some embodiments, the device provides the user with the
option for proceeding with a second payment transaction with a second retailer of the plurality of
retailers without invoking an application of the second retailer by: determining a type of the
second retailer, selecting a second template from among the plurality of templates based on the
type of the second retailer, displaying one or more items (e.g., goods or services) of the second
retailer using the selected second template, and wherein the first template and the second
template are the same when the type of the first retailer and the type of the second retailer are the
same.
[0439]           In accordance with some embodiments, the first template and the second template
are different when the type of the first retailer and the type of the second retailer are different.
[0440]           In accordance with some embodiments, providing the user with the option for
proceeding with the payment transaction without invoking an application of the retailer
comprises invoking a second application. The application of the first retailer, the first
application, and the second application are different applications.
[0441]           In accordance with some embodiments, the first retailer populates the selected
first template with the one or more items. For example, the first retailer populates the template
such as by specifying the items that the retailer sells and their cost.
[0442]           In accordance with some embodiments, publicly available information is used to
populate the selected first template with the one or more items. For example, a menu is retrieved
from public website and used to populate the selected first template.

[0444]            In accordance with some embodiments, the first application is a maps application
or a browser application.
[0445]            In accordance with some embodiments, the second application includes a
payment affordance for proceeding with the payment transaction using a payment account linked
to the electronic device.
[0446]            Examples of types of retailers include: event retailers, such as movie theaters and
concert venues; eating establishments, such as restaurants, bars, and coffee shops; transportation
companies, such as taxis, buses, trains, and airlines; lodging establishments, such as motels and
hotels; and clothing stores, such as dress stores and shoe stores.
[0447]            An example template for the lodging establishment may include, for example, the
number of rooms, the booking dates, the size of bed (e.g., queen or king), the number of beds
(e.g., 1 or 2), the check-in time, and the link. An example template for transportation companies
may include, for example, the expected departure and arrival time, the number of passengers, the
class of seat (e.g., coach, business, and first class). An example template for an event retailer
may include, for example, the date of the function, the type of seat (e.g., upper deck, lower deck,
and general admission), the number of tickets, the ticket pickup type (e.g., will call, print-at
home, email, and postal mail). An example template for an eating establishment may include,
for example, the types of food, the types of drinks, the size of drinks, and available reservation
dates and times.
[0448]            FIG. 20 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for invoking an application of a
retailer based on the availability of the application in accordance with some embodiments.
Method 2000 is performed at a device (e.g., 100, 300) with a display. Some operations in
method 2000 may be combined, the order of some operations may be changed, and some
operations may be omitted.
[0449]            As described below, method 2000 provides an intuitive way for invoking an
application of a retailer. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when making a
payment transaction, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery
operated computing devices, enabling a user to make a payment transaction faster and more
efficiently conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.

[0450]            At block 2002, a user interface (e.g., 1902) for a first application is displayed
(e.g., map application or web browser application that displays information about goods or
services). The user interface (e.g., 1902) for the first application includes information
identifying a plurality of retailers (e.g., 1904A-1904C).
[0451]            At block 2004, a request to initiate a payment transaction with a first retailer (e.g.,
 1904B) of the plurality of retailers (e.g., 1904A-1904C) is received (e.g., user taps on the
purchase selection affordance).
[0452]            At block 2006, in response to receiving the request to initiate a payment
transaction with the first retailer: at block 2008, in accordance with a determination that an
application of the first retailer (e.g., an application designated by the first retailer for handling
payment transactions from mobile devices, such as an application that is branded with the brand
of the first retailer) is available on the device, the application of the first retailer is invoked. The
application of the first retailer enables the user to initiate a payment transaction with the first
retailer (e.g., the first retailer's application is displayed and provides options for making the
purchase). At block 2010, in accordance with a determination that an application of the first
retailer is not available on the device, the user is provided with an option for proceeding with the
payment transaction without invoking the application of the first retailer (e.g., a separate
application not provided by the retailer is invoked and provides options for making the
purchase).
[0453]            In accordance with some embodiments, the processes described in relation to
FIGS. 14 and 13A-13D can be used to determine the payment account used to initiate the
payment transaction with the first retailer.
[0454]            Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method 2000
(e.g., FIGS. 19 and 20) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the methods described
below and above. For example, methods 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, and 2200 may
include one or more of the characteristics of the various methods described above with reference
to method 2000. For example, the information, retailers, requests, payment transactions, devices,
applications, and user interface elements described above with reference to method 2000
optionally have one or more of the characteristics of information, retailers, requests, payment
transactions, devices, applications, and user interface elements described herein with reference to
other methods described herein. For brevity, these details are not repeated below.
[0455]            FIG. 21 illustrates an exemplary user interface for providing a purchase
recommendation using an electronic device (e.g., 100, 300) in accordance with some
                                                      110

    WO 2015/184353                                                            PCT/US2015/033326
embodiments. The user interface is used to illustrate the processes described below, including
the process in FIG. 22.
[0456]           The device obtains a history of payment transactions associated with one or more
payment accounts linked to the device (e.g., purchases made using the payment accounts, such as
by using the electronic device to make the purchases). The device determines a current location
of the device (e.g., using GPS). The device determines, based on at least a portion of the history
of payment transactions and the current location of the device, a suggested product (or service)
for purchase from a retailer (e.g., a retailer that is proximate to the current location of the
device). The device displays an indication (e.g., 2102) of the suggested product for purchase.
The device displays an affordance (e.g., 2104) associated with a payment transaction of the
suggested product (e.g., a "purchase" affordance for purchasing the suggested product).
[0457]           While displaying the affordance (e.g., 2104) associated with the payment
transaction, the device detects activation of the affordance (e.g., 2104) associated with the
payment transaction. In response to detecting activation of the affordance associated with the
payment transaction, the device initiates a process for authorizing the payment transaction of the
suggested product (e.g., displaying a purchase user interface indicating the suggested product
and a price of the suggested product, or authorizing purchase of the suggested product).
[0458]           In accordance with some embodiments, the device detects a fingerprint on a
fingerprint sensor of the electronic device. In response to detecting the fingerprint on the
fingerprint sensor, the device determines whether the fingerprint is consistent with an enrolled
fingerprint that is enabled to authorize payment transactions. In accordance with a determination
that a respective fingerprint is consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device authorizes the
payment transaction. In accordance with a determination that the respective fingerprint is not
consistent with the enrolled fingerprint, the device forgoes authorization of the payment
transaction (e.g., the device does not authorize the payment transaction, meaning authorization is
still required to proceed with the payment transaction).
[0459]           In accordance with some embodiments, the displayed indication of the suggested
product for purchase is displayed without explicit user input requesting a suggestion (e.g., the
indication of the suggested product happens automatically).
[0460]           In accordance with some embodiments, the displayed indication of the suggested
product for purchase is displayed in response to an explicit user input requesting a suggestion
(e.g., asking a personal assistant for suggestions).

[0461]          In accordance with some embodiments, the displayed indication of the suggested
product for purchase is displayed in response to an implicit user input (e.g., the user turning
toward a store window and looking into the store window and then pulling out the device,
looking at the display of the device or unlocking the device, and opening a maps application or a
digital personal assistant application on the device).
[0462]          In accordance with some embodiments, the suggested product (or service) for
purchase from the retailer is determined based on a current time of day (or day of week).
[0463]          In accordance with some embodiments, the suggested product (or service) for
purchase from the retailer is determined based on the orientation of the device (e.g., the
suggestion is based on which business the user is facing, as determined by a direction that a back
of the device is facing).
[0464]          In accordance with some embodiments, while displaying the indication of the
suggested product for purchase, the device displays the name and business hours (e.g., 2106) of
the retailer.
[0465]          In accordance with some embodiments, while displaying the indication of the
suggested product for purchase, the device displays one or more reviews for the suggested
product.
[0466]          In accordance with some embodiments, while displaying the indication of the
suggested product for purchase, the device displays an affordance for purchasing a second
suggested product, the second suggested product determined based on the suggested product and
one or more reviews of the second suggested product.
[0467]          In accordance with some embodiments, while displaying the indication of the
suggested product for purchase, the device displays an affordance for purchasing a third
suggested product, the third suggested product determined based on the current location.
[0468]          In accordance with some embodiments, the device authorizes the payment
transaction of the suggested product using a secure element integrated into the electronic device.
[0469]          In accordance with some embodiments, the suggested product is a coffee. The
device receives confirmation of completion of the payment transaction of the coffee. The device
transmits purchase details of the coffee to the retailer (e.g., sending coffee size and flavor
preferences to the retailer before or after finalizing the payment). The device displays an
indication of the availability for pickup of the coffee at the retailer (e.g., when the retailer has
                                                   112

time at which the coffee will be available for pickup).
[0470]           FIG. 22 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for providing a purchase
recommendation using an electronic device in accordance with some embodiments. Method
2200 is performed at a device (e.g., 100, 300) with a display. Some operations in method 2200
may be combined, the order of some operations may be changed, and some operations may be
omitted.
[0471]           As described below, method 2200 provides an intuitive way for providing a
purchase recommendation. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user for receiving a
recommendation and making a purchase, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine
interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling a user to access a purchase
recommendation faster and more efficiently conserves power and increases the time between
battery charges.
[0472]           At block 2202, a history of payment transactions associated with one or more
payment accounts linked to the device is obtained (e.g., purchases made using the payment
accounts, such as by using the electronic device to make the purchases).
[0473]           At block 2204, a current location of the device is determined (e.g., using GPS).
[0474]           At block 2206, based on at least a portion of the history of payment transactions
and the current location of the device, a suggested product (or service) for purchase from a
retailer is determined (e.g., a retailer that is proximate to the current location of the device).
[0475]           At block 2208, an indication of the suggested product (e.g., 2102) for purchase is
displayed.
[0476]           At block 2210, an affordance (e.g., 2104) associated with a payment transaction
of the suggested product is displayed (e.g., a "purchase" button for purchasing the suggested
product).
[0477]           At block 2212, while displaying the affordance (e.g., 2104) associated with the
payment transaction, activation of the affordance (e.g., 2104) associated with the payment
transaction is detected.
[0478]           At block 2214, in response to detecting activation of the affordance (e.g., 2104)
associated with the payment transaction, a process for authorizing the payment transaction of the
suggested product is initiated (e.g., displaying a purchase user interface indicating the suggested
product and a price of the suggested product, or authorizing purchase of the suggested product).

[0680]          The foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been described with
reference to specific embodiments. However, the illustrative discussions above are not intended
to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and
variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The embodiments were chosen and
described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical applications.
Others skilled in the art are thereby enabled to best utilize the techniques and various
embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
[0681]          Although the disclosure and examples have been fully described with reference to
the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications will become
apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as
being included within the scope of the disclosure and examples as defined by the claims.
[0682]          As described above, one aspect of the present technology is the gathering and use
of data available from various sources to improve the delivery to users of invitational content or
any other content that may be of interest to them. The present disclosure contemplates that in
some instances, this gathered data may include personal information data that uniquely identifies
or can be used to contact or locate a specific person. Such personal information data can include
demographic data, location-based data, telephone numbers, email addresses, home addresses, or
any other identifying information.
[0683]          The present disclosure recognizes that the use of such personal information data,
in the present technology, can be used to the benefit of users. For example, the personal
information data can be used to deliver targeted content that is of greater interest to the user.
Accordingly, use of such personal information data enables calculated control of the delivered
content. Further, other uses for personal information data that benefit the user are also
contemplated by the present disclosure.
[0684]          The present disclosure further contemplates that the entities responsible for the
collection, analysis, disclosure, transfer, storage, or other use of such personal information data
will comply with well-established privacy policies and/or privacy practices. In particular, such
entities should implement and consistently use privacy policies and practices that are generally
recognized as meeting or exceeding industry or governmental requirements for maintaining
                                                   147

personal information data private and secure. For example, personal information from users
should be collected for legitimate and reasonable uses of the entity and not shared or sold outside
of those legitimate uses. Further, such collection should occur only after receiving the informed
consent of the users. Additionally, such entities would take any needed steps for safeguarding
and securing access to such personal information data and ensuring that others with access to the
personal information data adhere to their privacy policies and procedures. Further, such entities
can subject themselves to evaluation by third parties to certify their adherence to widely accepted
privacy policies and practices.
[0685]          Despite the foregoing, the present disclosure also contemplates embodiments in
which users selectively block the use of, or access to, personal information data. That is, the
present disclosure contemplates that hardware and/or software elements can be provided to
prevent or block access to such personal information data. For example, in the case of
advertisement delivery services, the present technology can be configured to allow users to select
to "opt in" or "opt out" of participation in the collection of personal information data during
registration for services. In another example, users can select not to provide location information
for targeted content delivery services. In yet another example, users can select to not provide
precise location information, but permit the transfer of location zone information.
[0686]          Therefore, although the present disclosure broadly covers use of personal
information data to implement one or more various disclosed embodiments, the present
disclosure also contemplates that the various embodiments can also be implemented without the
need for accessing such personal information data. That is, the various embodiments of the
present technology are not rendered inoperable due to the lack of all or a portion of such personal
information data. For example, content can be selected and delivered to users by inferring
preferences based on non-personal information data or a bare minimum amount of personal
information, such as the content being requested by the device associated with a user, other non
personal information available to the content delivery services, or publically available
information.
