                METHOD OF CONVERTING LIGNIN AND USES THEREOF
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001] The present invention relates to a method converting lignin to chemicals.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002] Lignocellulose is the major structural component of plants and comprises cellulose,
hemicellulose, and lignin. In lignocellulosic biomass, crystalline cellulose fibrils are embedded
in a less well-organized hemicellulose matrix which, in turn, is surrounded by an outer lignin
seal. Lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive feed-stock because it is an abundant, domestic,
renewable source that can be converted to liquid transportation fuels, chemicals and polymers.
The major constituents of lignocellulose are: (1) hemicellulose (20-30%), an amorphous
polymer of five and six carbon sugars; (2) lignin (5-30%), a highly cross-linked polymer of
phenolic compounds; and (3) cellulose (30-40%), a highly crystalline polymer of cellobiose (a
glucose dimer).
[0003] Lignin is a complex, hydrophobic, cross-linked aromatic polymer. In nature, lignin is
mainly found as an integral part of the cell wall, embedded in a carbohydrate polymer matrix of
cellulose and hemicellulose. Isolation of native lignin is complicated, when at all possible.
Lignins are polymers of phenylpropylene units, the exact composition of lignin varies widely
with species. It has been found that not all lignin is homogenous in structure; it seems to consist
of amorphous regions and structured forms. Lignin in higher cell walls is not amorphous.
Novikova, et al. (2002) Appl. Biochem. Microbial. 38: 181-185. Both the chemical and three
dimensional structure of lignin is strongly influenced by the polysaccharide matrix. Houtman &
Atalla (1995) Plant Physiol. 107: 997-984. Despite the fact that lignin is hydrophobic in
character, molecular dynamic simulations have suggested that the hydroxyl and methoxyl groups
in lignin precursors and oligomers may interact with cellulose microfibrils. The chemical
structure of native lignin is essentially changed under high temperature and acidic conditions. At
temperatures higher than 200"C, lignin has shown to be agglomerated into smaller particles and
separated from cellulose. Tanahashi, et al. (1983) J. Biochem. 125: 728-736.
[0004] Extracting lignin from lignocellulosic biomass generally results in lignin fragmentation
into numerous mixtures of irregular components. The generated lignin fractions, referred to as
lignin, are difficult to elucidate and characterize. Thus, lignin are usually burned to produce heat
and/or electricity within paper mills and biorefineries. Lignin lack consistency in their chemical
                                                    I

 and functional properties, they have complex molecular structures, and it is difficult to perform
 reliable routine analysis of the structural conformity and integrity of recovered lignin. EP
 2435458 Al. As such, lignin have not been adopted for widespread use, rather the cost for
 producing and/or purifying lignin is uneconomical and therefore lignin are usually deposited as
 waste.
 [0005] Methods of extracting lignin from lignocellulosic biomass are known in the art. Lignin
may be recovered during or after pulping of lignocellulosic feedstocks. See EP 2435458 Al.
Lignin may be extracted by the method of kraft pulping. See EP1002154. Lignin may be isolated
by a method of alkaline pulping. See EP0091457. Lignin may be extracted using the process of
acid hydrolysis. See EP0824616; EP1945823. Lignin may be extracted by a method of sulfite
pulping. See EP0205778. Lignin may be extracted by a method of dissolving cellulose. See
EP1654307. Lignin may be extracted by contacting the lignin (having a 1,1-diphenylpropan
unit) with a metal oxide in a liquid medium and separating the metal oxide carrying the lignin.
See EP 1900745 Al. Lignin may be extracted by pulping the feedstock with a selected organic
solvent and acid catalyst (pH) for a selected period of time, separating the cellulosic solids
fraction from the extractives liquid fraction; and recovering the lignin from an extractives liquid
fraction. See US 8378020 B 1. Lignin may be extracted using methods of bonding a phenol
derivative to the lignocellulose resource and, thereafter, contacting the lignocellulose resource
with sulfuric acid, whereby lignin is separated from cellulose, because lignin has a bound phenol
derivative. See EP 1022283 Al.
[0006] Efforts in converting lignin to its monomeric products have focused on technical lignins
extracted from lignocellulosic biomass. Efforts have been advanced to depolymerize lignin
through breakdown of alkyl-aryl ether linkages. However, this method has proven ineffective.
There have also been methods advancing electro-catalytic oxidative cleavage of lignin.
However, the products obtained were very low in yield and not economical. Oxidative
depolymerization has also been advanced. Though this process yielded a high recovery, the
process was uneconomical because it utilized high pressure, and very long reaction times.
Lignin has also been depolymerized using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. Varanasi, et al.
(2013) Biotechnology for Biofuels. 6:14. However, it is limited to a low percentage of biomass
load, where increasing the amount of biomass does not yield a higher percentage of monomeric
products.

[0007] Therefore, there exists a need in the art for a more efficient method of extracting lignin
from biomass and converting it to its constituent monomers and chemicals.

Lignin to Chemicals
[0053] The present invention provides a method for the sequential treatment of lignocellulosic
biomass to yield useful chemicals comprising the combination of ionic liquid pretreatment
followed by hydrothermal processing of lignin.
[0054] The lignocellulosic processing strategy employs sequential ionic liquid pretreatment
followed by hydrothermal processing of lignin which (a) can be used for treating any
lignocellulosic biomass substrates, (b) results in efficient lignin fraction generation, (c) enables
economic recovery of catalysts and chemicals. The inventors surprisingly discovered that the
combination of ionic liquid pretreatment with hydrothermal processing of lignin which
expectantly results in high yield of chemicals from lignin.

[0055] Methods for the pretreatment of biomass are known in the art including ionic liquid
pretreatment by dissolution, ionic liquid swelling, and alkaline treatment including Kraft
processing.
[0056] Biomass pretreatment by ionic liquids where the biomass is swollen with ionic liquids,
but not dissolved is described in U.S. Patent No. 8,030,030. Biomass pretreatment by ionic
liquids where the biomass is swollen with ionic liquids, but not dissolved, and heated with
radiofrequency heating is described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/663,315. The
lignin obtained by these methods is closer to a native state of lignin and more amenable to
conversion than lignin obtained by other methods.
[0057] An additional method of biomass pretreatment by ionic liquids where the biomass is
swollen with ionic liquids and further treated according to U.S. Patent Application, referenced by
Attorney-Docket number 73368.000029, is herein incorporated by reference.
[0058] Biomass pretreatment by ionic liquids where the biomass is dissolved in an ionic liquid is
described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/017252 and Varanasi, et al. (2013)
Biotechnology for Biofuels 6:14. However, the lignin produced by these methods is of a lower
molecular weight than methods where the biomass is swollen but not dissolved. This implies
that the lignin is a fractured polymer and is less intact than methods where the biomass is
swollen but not dissolved.
[0059] Biomass pretreatment by Kraft processing is well-known in the art, however, the lignin
produced by Kraft processing results in lignosulfonates (sulfonated lignin). The lignin obtained
by Kraft processing is less desirable because of the high level of sulfur.
Ionic Liquid (IL)
[0060] Ionic liquids are liquids at room temperature and may contain only ions and are molten
salts stable up to 300'C. See Sheldon (2001) Chem.Commun. 23: 2399-2407. They contain
cations which are usually organic compounds and anions of inorganic or organic components
such that the resulting salts are asymmetric. Because of poor packing associated with the
asymmetric nature of ILs, crystal formation is inhibited and ILs remain liquids over a wide range
of temperatures. A wide range of anions and cations can be employed to generate ILs with varied
melting points, viscosities, thermal stabilities and polarities. Examples of some of the cations
currently used include ammonium, sulfonium, phosphonium, lithium, imidazolium, pyridinium,
picolinium, pyrrolidinium, thiazolium, triazolium oxazolium, or combinations thereof.
                                                   11

Murugesan & Linhardt (2005) Current Organic Synthesis 2: 437-451. Ionic liquids are also
liquid at <100'C, broad liquid range, almost no vapor pressure, high polarity, high dissolving
power for organic and inorganic materials, good thermal, mechanical, and electrochemical
stability, high heat capacity, non-flammable, and electrical conductivity.
[0061] Ionic liquids have extremely low volatility and when used as solvents, they do not
contribute to emission of volatile components. In this sense they are environmentally benign
solvents. ILs have been designed to dissolve cellulose and lignocellulose. Following dissolution,
cellulose can be regenerated by the use of anti-solvents. However, the complete dissolution of
lignocellulosic materials (particularly woods) in ILs is harder and, even partial dissolution,
requires very long incubation of biomass in IL at elevated temperatures. Even then, a high yield
of cellulose is not generally achieved after regeneration. Fort, et al. (2007) Green. Chem. 9: 63.
[0062] The present invention differs from the classic approach to the use of ionic liquids in that
the aim is not to dissolve lignocellulose, but rather to contact it with the IL for times sufficient to
mainly disrupt lignin sheathing and swell the remaining biomass structure significantly (at least
30%) but not dissolve the lignocellulose and further apply radio frequency heating. This
combination treatment enables the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis process to proceed in a
relatively short period of time as well as give quantitative yields of glucose and high yields of
pentose sugars. Any ionic liquid capable of disrupting the hydrogen bonding structure to reduce
the crystallinity of cellulose in the biomass can be used in the treatment methods described
herein, and may comprise a cation structure that includes imidazolium, pyrroldinium,
pyridinium, phosphonium, ammonium, or a combination thereof and all functionalized analogs
thereof. For example, the structure of triazolium as shown in FIG. 3 wherein each of RI, R2, R3,
R4, and R5 may be hydrogen, an alkyl group having 1 to 15 carbon atoms or an alkene group
having 2 to 10 carbon atoms, wherein the alkyl group may be substituted with sulfone, sulfoxide,
thioether, ether, amide, hydroxyl, or amine and wherein an alkene group may be a halide,
hydroxide, formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, any functionalized mono- or di-carboxylic acid
having up to a total of 10 carbon atoms, succinate, lactate, aspartate, oxalate, trichloroacetate,
trifluoroacetate, dicyanamide, or carboxylate. Another example of the structure of IL is shown in
FIG. 3 pyridine wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6 may be hydrogen, an alkyl group
having 1 to 15 carbon atoms or an alkene group having 2 to 10 carbon atoms, wherein the alkyl
group may be substituted with sulfone, sulfoxide, thioether, ether, amide, hydroxyl, or amine and
                                                  12

 wherein A may be a halide, hydroxide, formate, acetate, propanoate, butyrate, any functionalized
 mono- or di-carboxylic acid having up to a total of 10 carbon atoms, succinate, lactate, aspartate,
 oxalate, trichloroacetate, trifluoroacetate, dicyanamide, or carboxylate. The halide can be a
 chloride, fluoride, bromide or iodide.
 [0063] Also an ionic liquid mixture with a composition described by Equation 1 may be used in
 the methods and systems described herein.
                                          20
                                               [C+],[A ]
                                        n=1
 [0064] C' denotes the cation of the IL and A- denotes the anionic component of the IL In
 Equation 1. Each additional IL added to the mixture may have either the same cation as a
previous component or the same anion as a previous component, of differ from the first only in
 the unique combination of the cation and anion. For example, consider below the five component
mixture of ILs in which common cations and anions are used, but each individual IL component
 is different:
 [BMIM*+][Cl~]+[BMIM*][PF6-]+[EMIM*][Cl-]+[EM- IM*][PF6_]+[EMIM*+][BF4-]
 [0065] The final mixture of ionic liquids will vary in the absolute composition as can be defined
by the mole percent of various functionalized cations and anions. Therefore, the mixture may be
comprised of varying weight percentages of each utilized component, as defined by Equation 1.
The use of several such representative solvents for treating biomass may be 1-Ethyl-3
Methylimidazolium Propionate (EMIM-Pr) as described in U.S. Patent No. 8,030,030. Also the
ionic liquid 1-(4-sulfonic acid) butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate may be used.
[0066] The ionic liquid may have a water content not exceeding about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25%. Also, the ionic liquid may be
recovered and reused.

Recovery of IL/Dehydration of IL
[0067] The wash effluent may be collected and the ionic liquid dehydrated by the application of
RF energy. The RF energy heats IL faster than it heats water because of a stronger dipole
moment in IL. Without being bound to a specific theory, the inventors surprisingly discovered
that the ions try to align with the electromagnetic (EM) (e.g., radiofrequency) waves, always
changing a dipole moment. The IL heated by RF acts as a substrate for the water to heat and
evaporate from the IL wash effluent. Thus, the wash effluent comprising a solvent and ionic
liquid may be heated using RF energy. The RF energy drive off the water which may be
collected and removed from the wash. The resultant ionic liquid is thus dehydrated (e.g., the
water has been removed) and may be reused. See U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.
61/663,315.
Hydrothermal Conversion of Lignin
[0068] The lignin obtained by methods comprising ionic liquid pretreatment where the biomass
is swelled with the ionic liquid but not dissolved may undergo hydrothermal processing to
convert the lignin to its constituent monomers and chemicals.
[0069] The hydrothermal processing may be performed under increased pressure. The pressure
may be greater than about 1 ATM, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 60-150, 10-150 ATM.
The pressure may be about 10-100 ATM. The pressure may be about 20-80 ATM. The pressure
may be about 10-120 ATM. The pressure may be about 70-120 ATM.
[0070] The hydrothermal processing may be performed under increased temperature. The
temperature may be about 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230,
240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300-C, 200-250-C, 200-300-C, 250-300C, or 250-350 C. The
temperature may be about 1000-300 0C. The temperature may be about 100 -350 C. The
temperature may be about 2000-300 C. The temperature may be about 250-350*C. The
temperature may be about 300-350 'C
[0071] The hydrothermal processing may be performed for about 1-60 minutes, 1-30 minutes,
1-15 minutes, 1 minute, 1-5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 15 minutes. The hydrothermal processing
may be performed for about 1-10 minutes. The hydrothermal processing may be performed for
about 1-3 minutes. The hydrothermal processing may be performed for about 0-3 minutes.
[0072] The hydrothermal processing may be performed in presence of aromatic or aliphatic
alcohols/acids under mild basic or acidic conditions.
                                                  14

[0073] The hydrothermal processing may be performed in a batch or sequential mode in the
presence of catalysts to produce (i) oxygenated products, (ii) deoxygenated products and or
dehydrogenated products.
[0074] The separation process comprises hydrothermal processing. In one embodiment,
hydrothermal processing depolymerizes lignin into its monomeric products. In an embodiment,
hydrothermal processing is carried out at pressures less than or equal to 200 ATM. In an
embodiment, hydrothermal processing is carried out at temperatures less than 300'C, preferably
between 250'C, and 300C. In an embodiment, lignin is subjected to hydrothermal processing
for less than 10 minutes, preferably less than 1 minute.
[0075] The hydrothermal processing may comprise conversion in presence of aromatic or
aliphatic alcohols/acids under mild acidic or basic medium.
[0076] The hydrothermal processing may be catalytically conducted in a single or sequential
steps to produce oxygenated products, deoxygenated products and/or dehydrogenated products.
[0077] The separated lignin may be further analyzed using a chemical analytical method
comprising: gas chromatography - mass spectrophotometry, gas chromatography - infrared
spectroscopy, liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography - NMR
spectroscopy, or liquid chromatography - infrared spectroscopy.
[0078] In one embodiment, the carrier gas for gas chromatography - mass spectrophotometry
comprises helium, nitrogen, hydrogen, or argon.

[0081] The separation process may also comprise column chromatography, high performance
liquid chromatography, thin layer chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, or
combinations thereof. In an embodiment, the separation process allows each compound fraction
to elute at a specific retention time with a particular intensity, depending on the concentration of
that compound in the lignin. These compounds may be commercially utilized.

[00831 Proceeding now to a description of the drawings, FIG. 1 shows an exemplary series for
carrying out steps of a method of the present invention.
[0084] One of the following representative ionic liquids 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride
(BMIMCl)/1-n-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium acetate (EMIMAc)/l-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium
propionate (EMIMPr)/1-allyi-3-methyl imidazolium chloride/3-methyl-N-butylpyridinium
chloride may be contacted with small particles of biomass 100 (e.g., dry corn stover or poplar (
20+80 mesh sized particles)] for varying times (about 5 minutes to 8 hours) 200. Incubation
with biomass may be carried out using electromagnetic (EM) (e.g., radiofrequency) heating and
ultrasonics, electromagnetic (EM) (e.g., radiofrequency), convective, conductive heating, or
combinations thereof at about 500 C to 200 0 C as long as the ionic liquid is in molten state during
incubation 300. The conditions may be monitored by use of sensors and adjusted to maintain
conditions. The biomass may be heated with RF heating at about 27 mHz for at least about 5
seconds to 2 hours. The swelled biomass/IL may then be heated using ultrasonics,
electromagnetic (EM) (e.g., radiofrequency), convective, conductive heating, or combinations
thereof for about at least 3-30 minutes or 3-4 hours. The conditions may be monitored and
adjusted to maintain uniform heating and sufficient penetration of the biomass by the RF waves.
Steps 200, 300, and/or 400 may be repeated. Further, steps 300 and/or 400 may be carried out in
batch or continuous form. The goal of treatment 300 is not achieving any dissolution of
lignocellulose, but heating the swelled biomass for sufficient time to redistribute lignin and swell
the remaining biomass structure to enhance the hydrolysis rate and conversion of cellulose and
hemicellulose to their constituent sugars and release lignin 500.
[0085] The treated biomass may then be contacted with one of the representative wash-solvents,
namely, methanol/ethanol/water/acetonitrile/butanol/propano        400. The wash-solvent mixes with
the IL (in all proportions) and hence is able to extract it from the incubated biomass. The treated
biomass may then be separated from the ionic liquid/wash solvent solution by centrifugation.
The hydrolysate stream of the biomass, stripped off the IL, may then be hydrolyzed with a
cellulase system 500. The IL may be recovered from the wash-solvent and any dissolved
                                                    17

biomass components from the wash-step through suitable separation methods including at least
one of the following: activated charcoal treatment, distillation, membrane separation,
electrochemical separation techniques, solid phase extraction, liquid-liquid extraction, or a
combination thereof. The ionic liquid may then be recycled back to the treatment tank. The wash
solvent also may be recycled back for reuse in washing IL-incubated biomass. The wash solvent
may also be dehydrated by RF heating to dehydrate the wash solvent, driving off the water
leaving a dehydrated IL 900.
[0086] The IL may be recovered from the IL/wash solvent mixtures by evaporation of the wash
solvent (ethanol and/or water) from the extremely low volatility IL 400. The recovered IL may
then be used with no additional cleaning steps in subsequent biomass treatment cycles at constant
treatment conditions. The method allows for the repeated reuse of the IL with minimal cleaning
which may lead to increased cost savings in IL- treatment.
[0087] Residual water in the recycled IL can lower the IL's capacity to sever the inter- and intra
chain hydrogen bonds imparting crystallinity to cellulose. In order to affect swelling of biomass,
several of the cellulosic hydrogen-bonds have to be disrupted. Accordingly, it is expect dissolved
water to affect IL's performance as a biomass treatment solvent. The admissible water content in
IL can affect the economics of the treatment method in two aspects. First, it determines how dry
the IL has to be before it can be reused. Second, it determines how dry the biomass has to be
during incubation with IL.
[0088] After hydrolysis 500, enzymes may be recovered from the hydrolysis reactor and
recycled. Complete removal of wash solvent (water) is not necessary before the IL is recycled.
Many other treatment methods are not amenable to easy recovery of the chemicals employed in
the process. Following the wash of treated biomass 400, lignin from the wash 601 is separated
from the hydrolysate residue 600. Also, ultra-filtration of the liquid portion of the hydrolysate,
provides a means of recovering the hydrolysis enzymes for reuse from the sugar solution which
is the precursor for the production of a number of fuels and chemicals 800.
[0089] The current method of treatment with RF and ionic liquid, optionally, followed by
hydrolysis (saccharification technique) 500 allows for recovering the lignin in the biomass 600 in
the form a post saccharification solid residue. Finally, the lignin obtained following treatment of
biomass 300 and/or hydrolysis 500 may be collected and converted by hydrothermal processing
700 to chemicals 701 no further conditioning and adverse effects from any residual traces of IL
                                                 18

in the hydrolysate. Further chemical/biochemical processing of the lignin may lead to
compounds which could be used for the production of fuels, chemicals, polymers and other
materials.

[0093] Lignocellulosic biomass was treated by sequential ionic liquid pretreatment followed by
hydrolysis to produce a cellulosic fraction and a lignin fraction. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No.
8,030,030 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/663,315. The lignin fraction was
subjected to hydrothermal processing about 100-150 ATM and 200-300'C for approximately 1
30 minutes. The monomeric compounds obtained were analyzed using gas chromatography
mass spectrometry. The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 2A and 2B. Products
obtained as shown in Figure 2A are further reprocessed catalytically to produce deoxygenated
chemicals as shown in Figure 2B.
