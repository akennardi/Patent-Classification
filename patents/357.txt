   Field of the invention
 5       The present application is    a divisional application
   of Australian Application No. 2012331260, which is
   incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.
         The invention relates to a spinach plant comprising a
   single dominant gene which leads to resistance to
10 Peronospora farinosa f. sp.    spinaciae races Pfsl,  Pfs2,
   Pfs3,  Pfs4,  Pfs5, Pfs6, Pfs9, Pfsll,   Pfsl2, Pfs13 and
   UA4410. The invention also relates to progeny of said
   spinach plant, to propagation material of said spinach
   plant, to a cell of said spinach plant, to seed of said
15 spinach plant, and to harvested leaves of said spinach
   plant. This   invention further relates to use of a spinach
   plant in breeding to confer resistance against Peronospora
   farinosa f.   sp.  spinaciae.
20 Background of the invention
         Spinach   (Spinacia oleracea) is  a flowering plant from
   the Amaranthaceae family that     is grown as a vegetable. The
   consumable parts of spinach are the leaves from the
   vegetative stage. Spinach is sold loose, bunched, in pre
25 packed bags, canned, or frozen. There are three basic
   types  of spinach, namely the savoy, semi-savoy and smooth
   types.  Savoy has dark green, crinkly and curly leaves.
   Flat or smooth leaf spinach has broad, smooth leaves.
   Semi-savoy is a variety with slightly crinkled leaves. The
30 main market for spinach is baby-leaf. Baby spinach leaves
   are usually of the flat-leaf variety and usually the
   harvested leaves are not    longer than about eight
   centimetre. These tender, sweet leaves are sold loose

                                la
  rather than in bunches. They are often used in salads, but
  can also be lightly cooked. Downy mildew - in spinach
  caused by the oomycete fungus Peronospora farinosa f. sp.
  spinaciae  (formerly known as P. effusa) - is a major
5 threat for spinach growers,

   because it affects the harvested plant parts, namely the
   leaves. Infection makes the leaves unsuitable for sale and
   consumption, as it manifests itself phenotypically as yellow
   lesions on the older leaves, and on the abaxial leaf surface
 5 a greyish fungal growth can be observed. The infection can
   spread very rapidly, and it can occur both in glasshouse
   Cultivation and in soil cultivation. The optimal temperature
   for formation and germination of P. farinosa f. sp.
   spinaciae spores is 9 to 12*C, and it is facilitated by a
10 high relative humidity. When spores are deposited on a humid
   leaf surface they can readily germinate and infect the leaf.
   Fungal growth is optimal between 8 and 20*C and a relative
   humidity of   80%, and within 6 and 13 days after infection
   mycelium growth can be observed. Oospores of P. farinosa can
15 survive in the soil for up to 3 years, or as mycelium in
   seeds or living plants.
              In recent years various resistance genes have been
   identified that provide spinach plants with a resistance
   against downy mildew. However, it has been observed that
20 previously resistant spinach cultivars can again become
   susceptible to the fungus. Investigations revealed that the
   cultivars themselves had not changed, and that the loss of
   downy mildew resistance must therefore be due to P. farinosa
   overcoming the resistance in these spinach cultivars. The
25 downy mildew races (also called physios or isolates) that
   were able to infect resistant spinach cultivars were
   collected in a differential reference set, which can be used
   to test spinach cultivars for resistance. The differential
   set comprises a series of spinach cultivars   (hybrids) that
30 have different resistance patterns to the currently
   identified pathogenic races.
              To date 14 pathogenic races of spinach downy
   mildew  (Pfs) have been officially identified and

                                  .3
   characterized. Races 4 through 10 have been identified
   between 1990 and 2009  (Irish et al., 2008, Phytopathol. 98:
   894-900), which illustrates the versatility and adaptability
   of the fungus to overcome resistances in spinach. In
 5 different geographical regions different combinations of
   pathogenic races occur, and the spinach industry therefore
   has a strong demand for spinach cultivars that are resistant
   to as many relevant downy mildew races as possible,
   preferably to all races that may occur in their region, and
10 even to the newest threats that cannot be countered with the
   resistances that are present in the commercially available
   spinach cultivars.
             In March and August 2011, the "International
   Working Group on Peronospora farinosa"   (IWGP) designated two
15 isolates as the type isolates for new races Pfsl2 and Pfsl3,
   respectively. As illustrated by Table 1, these newly
   identified Peronospora races can break the resistance of
   many spinach varieties that are currently used commercially
   worldwide, and they thus pose a serious threat to the
20 productivity of the spinach industry.
             Spinach variety Viroflay is susceptible to all
   known physios, while cultivars such as Lion and Lazio show
   resistance to multiple races. However, it is crucial to stay
   at the forefront of developments in this field, as
25 Peronospora continuously develops the ability to break the
   resistances that are present in commercial spinach
   varieties. For this reason new resistance genes are very
   valuable assets, and they form an important research focus
   in spinach breeding. The goal of spinach breeders is to
30 rapidly develop spinach varieties with a resistance to as
   many Peronospora races as possible, including the latest
   identified races, before these races become wide-spread and
   can threaten the industry.

                                 '1
             Recently another new Peronospora isolate has been
   identified, termed UA4410, which subsequently has been
   officially named Pfsl4. Along with the 13 other officially
   recognized Pfs races this isolate is publicly available from
 5 the Department of Plant Pathology, University of Arkansas,
   Fayetteville, AR 72701, USA, and also from NAK Tuinbouw,
   Sotaweg 22, 2371 GD  Roelofarendsveen, the Netherlands.
              In the prior art no single dominant resistance
   gene is known that confers resistance to the new physios
10 Pfs12, Pfs13 and UA4410. In the absence af a suitable
   resistance to counter this pathogenic threat, these new
   isolates may spread during the next growing seasons and
   cause great damage to the worldwide spinach industry in the
   immediate future.
15           In order to confer a resistance that is as broad
   as possible, i.e. that confers resistance to as many Pfs
   physics as possible, preferable to all known Pfs physics, it
   is very useful to be able to stack different resistance
   genes against Peronospora infection in spinach. Such a
20 combination of different resistance genes on one gene
   segment is highly desirable. It is much easier if the
   resistance genes inherit as single dominant loci, because in
   that case the resistance pattern conferred by the dominant
   resistance gene cannot segregate away in the progeny of the
25 cross, and will always inherit as one single set of
   resistances to various pathogenic races.
             It is therefore the object of the invention to
   provide a single, dominant resistance gene in spinach,
   conferring resistance to various Peronospora races,
30 including the ones that have been most recently identified,
   which enables the easy transfer of this broad resistance
   pattern to other spinach plants.

   Summary of the invention
             The invention thus relates to spinach plants
   comprising a single dominant gene which confers resistance
   to Peronospora farinosa f. sp. spinaciae races Pfsl, Pfs2,
 5 Pfs3, Pfs4, Pfs5, Pfs6, Pfs9, Pfsll,  Pfs12, Pfs13 and
   UA4410, wherein the gene is obtainable by introgression from
   a plant grown from seeds of which a representative sample
   was deposited with the NCIMB under NCIMB accession number
   41857.
10           The present invention relates to a new resistance
   gene - named R6 - that confers resistance onto spinach
   plants to downy mildew races Pfsl,  Pfs2, Pfs3, Pfs4, Pfs5,
   Pfs6, Pfs9, Pfs11, Pfs12, Pfs13 and UA4410. In the prior art
   no spinach cultivars are known that have a resistance
15 against the combination of these pathogenic races, that is
   conferred by a single dominant resistance gene. The current
   invention thus represents an important step forward in the
   field of downy mildew resistance in spinach. The new
   resistance gene of the invention  (R6) behaves as a single
20 dominant locus. It can be easily introduced into any other
   spinach plant, irrespective of the type   (smooth, semi-savoy
   or savoy) or leaf morphology (smooth, weakly to strongly
   incised) or any other characteristic, to render it resistant
   against Peronospora isolates Pfsl, Pfs2, Pfs3, Pfs4, Pfs5,
25 Pfs6, Pfs9, Pfsll, Pfs12, Pfs13 and UA4410.
             Stacking of the R6 resistance gene of the
   invention that provides resistance to Pfsl, Pfs2, Pfs3,
   Pfs4, Pfs5, Pfs6, Pfs9, Pfs11, Pfsl2, Pfs13 and .UA4410 with
   other resistance genes known in the art and/or with those
30 that will be identified in the future can lead to resistance
   against all known Peronospora races.
             Spinach plants of the invention, carrying the new
   source of resistance designated as R6, can be crossed to

   other spinach plants carrying one or more resistance genes
   different from R6, to obtain an even broader resistance to
   the various Peronospora races.
             The spinach plants of the invention are obtainable
 5 by crossing a first spinach plant with a second spinach
   plant, wherein one or both of the spinach plants comprises
   the resistance gene of the invention, to obtain F1 plants.
   Detailed description of the invention
10           The invention thus relates to a dominant
   resistance gene in spinach, that confers resistance to a
   broad range of pathogenic races, in particular the races
   Pfsl, Pfs2, Pfs3, Pfs4, Pfs5, Pfs6, Pfs9, Pfsll,   Pfs12,
   Pfsl3 and UA4410 of the fungus Peronospora farinosa f. sp.
15 spinaciae. The resistance trait is genetically inherited as
   a single dominant locus. Its presence in a plant can be
   detected using a disease resistance assay as described in
   example 1. The disease resistance assay shows the phenotype,
   as illustrated by example 1. The genotype of the disease
20 resistance can be assayed by testing the inheritance of the
   resistance gene. In an F2 population this gene segregates in
   a 3:1 ratio, i.e. on average 3 out of 4 F2 plants possess
   the resistance pattern of the invention, as is illustrated
   by example 2.
25           The single dominant R6 gene can be introduced into
   any other plant by introgression from a plant grown from
   seeds of which a representative sample was deposited with
   the NCIMB on July 2 6Lh 2011 under NCIMB accession number
   41857 or any other plant derived therefrom. The deposited
30 seeds comprise the R6 gene and are thus a source of the
   gene. It can be introduced into other spinach plants of the
   same or a different type, such as savoy, semi-savoy and
   smooth as described in example 2. Spinach plants that carry

   the same dominant R6 gene as is found in plants grown from
   seeds deposited under NCIMB accession number 41857 but are
   not directly obtained therefrom are also plants of the
   invention.
 5            The invention also relates to progeny of a spinach
    plant, which progeny is resistant to Peronospora farinosa f.
    sp. spinaciae races Pfsl, Pfs2, Pfs3, Pfs4, Pfs5, Pfs6,
    Pfs9, Pfsll, Pfs12, Pfs13 and UA4410. Such progeny can be
    produced by sexual or vegetative reproduction of a plant of
10  the invention or a progeny plant thereof. The progeny plant
    displays the R6 resistance trait in the same or in a similar
    way as the plant of which representative seed was deposited
    (NCIMB 41857).  This means that such progeny has the same
    downy mildew resistance characteristics as claimed for the
15  spinach plants of the invention.
              As used herein the word "progeny" is intended to
    mean the offspring or the first and all further descendants
    from a cross with a plant of the invention that shows the RE
    resistance trait. Progeny of the invention comprises
20  descendants of any cross with a plant of the invention that
    carries the R6 resistance trait. Such progeny is for example
    obtainable by crossing a first spinach plant with a second
    spinach plant, wherein one of the spinach plants was grown
    from seeds of a plant of the invention, representative seeds
25  of which were deposited with the NCIMB under NCIMB accession
    number 41857, but can also be the progeny of any other
    spinach plant carrying the RE gene as present in NCIMB
    41857.
              The said progeny plants comprise an introgression
30  fragment that comprises resistance gene R6, wherein the said
    introgression fragment is obtainable from a spinach plant of
    which representative seed is deposited with the NCIMB under
    NCIMB accession number 41857. The resistance trait thus has

                                   0
    a genetic basis in the genome of a spinach plant, and using
    the assay described in example 1, spinach plants can be
    identified as being plants of the invention. It is
    understood that a parent plant that provides the trait of
 5  the invention is not necessarily a plant grown directly from
    the deposited seeds. The parent can also be a progeny plant
    from the seed, or a progeny plant from seeds that are
    identified to have  (or to have acquired) the trait of the
    invention by other means. In one embodiment, the invention
10  relates to spinach plants that carry the trait of the
    invention and that have acquired the said trait by
    introduction of the genetic information that is responsible
    for the trait from a suitable source, either by conventional
    breeding, or genetic modification, in particular by cis
15  genesis or trans-genesis. Cis-genesis is genetic
    modification of plants with a natural gene, encoding an
    (agricultural) trait from the crop plant itself or from a
    sexually compatible donor plant. Trans-genesis is genetic
    modification of a plant with a gene from a non-crossable
20  species or with a synthetic gene.
              In one embodiment, the source from which the
    genetic information is acquired is formed by plants grown
    from the deposited seeds, or by sexual or vegetative
    descendants therefrom. "Progeny" also encompasses plants
25  that carry the trait of the invention which are obtained
    from other plants of the invention by vegetative propagation
    or multiplication.
              The invention further relates to propagation
   material of a spinach plant of the invention, wherein a
30 plant grown or regenerated from the said propagation
   material is resistant to Peronospora farinosa f. sp.
   spinaciae races Pfsl,  Pfs2, Pfs3, Pfs4, Pfs5, Pfs6, Pfs9,
   Pfs11,  Pfsl2, Pfs13 and UA4410. In one embodiment, the

   propagation material is suitable for sexual reproduction.
   Such propagation material comprises for example microspores,
   pollen, ovaries, ovules, embryo sacs and egg cells. In
   another embodiment, the propagation material is suitable for
 5 vegetative reproduction. Such propagation material comprises
   for example cuttings, roots, stems, cells, protoplasts, and
   tissue cultures of regenerable cells, parts of the plant
   that are suitable for preparing tissue cultures, in
   particular leaves, pollen, embryos, cotyledons, hypocotyls,
10 meristematic cells, root tips, anthers, flowers, seeds and
   stems.
              The invention further relates to a spinach plant
    grown or regenerated from the said propagation material of a
    plant of the invention, which plant is resistant to
15  Peronospora farinosa f. sp. spinaciae races Pfsl, Pfs2,
    Pfs3, Pfs4, Pfs5, Pfs6, Pfs9, Pfsll,  Pfs12, Pfsl.3 and
    UA4410.
              The invention further relates to a cell of a
    spinach plant of the invention, which cell comprises a
20  single dominant gene which leads to resistance to
    Peronospora farinosa f. sp. spinaciae races Pfsl, Pfs2,
    Pfs3, Pfs4, Pfs5, Pfs6, Pfs9, Pfs11, Pfs12, Pfs13, UA4410,
    wherein the said gene is as present in a spinach plant,
    representative seeds of which were deposited under NCIMB
25  accession number 41857. The said cell thus comprises the
    genetic information encoding the said resistance, in
    particular genetic information which is substantially
    identical, preferably completely identical to the genetic
    information encoding the said resistance trait of the
30  spinach plant, representative seeds of which were deposited
    under NCIMB accession number 41857, more in particular the
    R6 gene described herein. Preferably, the cell of the

                                 I V
   invention is part of a plant or plant part, but the cell may
   also be in isolated form.
             The invention also relates to a cell of a spinach
   plant of the invention, which cell comprises a single
 5 dominant gene which leads to resistance to Peronospora
   farinosa f. sp. spinaciae races Pfsl,  Pfs2, Pfs3, Pfs4,
   Pfs5, Pfs6, Pfs9, Pfsll,  Pfsl2, Pfsl3, UA4410, and which
   plant is obtained by transferring the Peronospora farinosa
   f. sp. spinaciae resistance as found in seeds that were
10 deposited under NCIMB accession number 41857 into an
   agronomically valuable spinach plant.
             The invention further relates to seed of the
   spinach plant of the invention, which seed contain in their
   genome the genetic information that encodes the resistance
15 trait of the invention.
             The invention also relates to the use of seeds
   that were deposited under NCIMB accession number 41857 for

   farinosa f. sp. spinaciae races Pfsl, Pfs2, Pfs3, Pfs4,
   Pfs5, Pfs6, Pfs9, Pfsll,  Pfs12, Pfs13, UA4410 due to the
   presence, in the genome of the plant, of the Peronospora
   farinosa f. sp. spinaciae resistance as found in seeds that
10 were deposited under NCIMB accession number 41857 as a
   source of propagating material.
             The invention also relates to the use of a spinach
   plant of the invention that is resistant to Peronospora

   presence, in the genome of the plant, of the Peronospora
   farinosa f. sp. spinaciae resistance as found in seeds that
   were deposited under NCIMB accession number 41857 for
   consumption.
20           The invention also relates to harvested leaves of
   spinach plants of the invention, to food products comprising
   harvested leaves of spinach plants of the invention, either
   in natural or in processed form, and to a container
   comprising one or more spinach plants of the invention in a

   spinach plant of the invention in breeding to confer
   resistance against Peronospora farinosa f.  sp. spinaciae.
30           The invention also relates to the use of the
   Peronospora farinosa f. sp. spinaciae resistance as found in
   seeds that were deposited under NCIMB accession number 41857
   for conferring resistance to Peronospora farinosa f. sp.

    spinaciae races Pfsl, Pfs2, Pfs3, Pfs4, Pfs5, Pfs6, Pfs9,
    Pfsll, Pfs12, Pfsl3, UA4410 onto a Spinacia oleracea plant.
              The invention further relates to the use of a
    Spinacia oleracea plant as a recipient of Peronospora
 5  farinosa f. sp. spinaciae resistance as found in seeds that
    were deposited under NCIMB accession number 41857.
           In one aspect the invention relates to a method for
   production of a spinach plant which is resistant to
   Peronospora farinosa f. sp. spinaciae races Pfsl, Pfs2,
10 Pfs3, Pfs4,  Pfs5, Pfs6, Pfs9, Pfsll, Pfsl2, Pfsl3, UA4410,
   comprising
           a) crossing a plant comprising a genetic determinant
   that leads to the said trait with another plant;
           b) selecting plants that have the said trait in the
15 Fl;
           c) optionally performing one or more rounds of
   selfing or crossing, and subsequently selecting, for a plant
   comprising/showing the trait of the invention.
           The word "trait" in the context of this application
20 refers to the phenotype of the plant. In particular, the
   word "trait" refers to the trait of the invention, more in
   particular to the resistance to Peronospora farinosa f. sp.
   spinaciae races Pfsl, Pfs2, Pfs3, Pfs4,  Pfs5, Pfs6, Pfs9,
   Pfs1l, Pfsl2, Pfsl3, UA4410. The term "genetic determinant"
25 is used for the genetic information in the genome of the
   plant that causes the trait of the invention. When a plant
   shows the trait of the invention, its genome comprises the
   genetic determinant causing the trait of the invention. The
   plant thus has the genetic determinant of the invention.
30         It is clear that the parent that provides the trait
   of the invention is not necessarily a plant grown directly
   from the deposited seeds. The parent can also be a progeny
   plant from the seed or a progeny plant from seeds that are

                                 1.3
   identified to have the trait of the invention by other
   means.

20 EXAMPLES
   EXAMPLE 1
   Testing for the R6 resistance trait in spinach plants
              The resistance to downy mildew infection was
   assayed as described by Irish et al.       (2008; Phytopathol. 98:
25 894-900),  using a differential set. Spinach plants of the
   invention (R6) were planted along with spinach plants from
   different other genotypes     (see Table 1) in trays containing
   Scotts Redi-Earth medium, and fertilized twice a week after
   seedling emergence with Osmocote Peter's       (13-13-13)
30 fertilizer   (Scotts). Plants were inoculated with a
   sporangial suspension    (2.5  x 10 5/ml) of a pathogenic race of
   Peronospora farinosa f. sp. spinaciae at the first true leaf

                                  io
   stage. In this manner, 11 pathogenic races were tested (as
   shown in Table 1).
             The inoculated plants were placed in a dew chamber
   at 18*C with 100% relative humidity for a 24 h period, and
 5 then moved to a growth chamber at 180C with a 12 h
   photoperiod for 6 days. After 6 days, the plants were
   returned to the dew chamber for 24 h to induce sporulation,
   and they were scored for disease reaction.
             Plants were scored as resistant or susceptible
10 based on symptoms of chlorosis and signs of pathogen
   sporulation on the cotyledons and true leaves, as described
   by Irish et al.  (2007; Plant Dis. 91: 1392-1396).  Plants
   exhibiting any evidence of chlorosis and sporulation were
   considered susceptible. Resistant plants were re-inoculated
15 to assess whether plants initially scored as resistant had
   escaped infection, or whether they were truly resistant.
             Table 1 shows the differential set of spinach
   downy mildew races and the resistance of various spinach
   varieties  (hybrids) to each one of these pathogenic races. A
20 susceptible reaction is scored as "+"   (indicating a
   successful infection by the fungus, with sporulation
   occurring on the entire cotyledon),  and resistance is
   depicted as  "-" (absence of sporulation on the cotyledons).
   A weak resistance response is indicated as "(+)",   which in
25 practice means a slightly reduced level of infection    (with
   sporulation only occurring on the tips of the cotyledons in
   the differential seedling test).  R6 is a line exhibiting the
   resistance of the present invention, and the resistance
   patterns of the parental lines of hybrid variety "Lion" are
30 also shown.
             Comparison of the parental lines of Lion to Lion
   itself reveals that the broad resistance pattern of Lion
   results from the combination of at least two resistance

   genes, coming from either of the parents, because both
   parents only possess parts of the resistance profile of the
   hybrid  (Lion) that results from the crossing of these two
   lines. The genetic basis of the resistance in Lion is thus
 5 multigenic in nature, caused by the stacking of at least two
   resistance genes in the hybrid variety, and hence the
   genetic basis of the Peronospora resistance in Lion is
   entirely different from that in plants of the present
   invention.
10             In contrast, the R6 resistance trait of the
   present invention is conferred by a single dominant locus,
   which has the great advantage that the R6 resistance trait
   can be easily transferred to other spinach varieties by
   crosting/introgression, and that it can easily be combined
15 with other resistance genes. When combined with selected
   other genes that e.g. confer resistance to downy mildew
   races Pfs7, PfsS and PfslO,         the R6 trait can be used to
   provide resistance to all downy mildew races known to date
   in spinach.

   EXAMPLE 2
   Introduction of the R6 resistance trait into other spinach
   plants
             A plant of the invention was crossed (as a father)
 5 with a plant that does not contain the R6 resistance trait,
   to obtain an Fl. Thirty plants of the Fl population were
   tested for resistance to Peronospora race UA4410, as
   described in example 1. This particular resistance was
   absent from the mother plant used in the said cross. All 30
10 plants showed the resistance pattern of the invention, i.e.
   resistance to pathogenic race UA4410. This demonstrated that
   the R6 resistance gene inherits in a dominant manner.
             In another experiment, a plant of the invention
   was crossed (as a mother) with a different spinach plant
15 that does not contain the R6 resistance trait of the
   invention. Plants of the Fl population were selfed, and a
   total of 76 plants of the F2 generation were tested for
   Peronospora resistance, as described in example 1. As a
   positive discriminator for the presence of the R6 trait,
20 resistance to Pfs11 was assayed, because this resistance was
   present in the mother plant  (R6) but not in the father plant
   of the cross.
             It was observed that Pfsll resistance segregated
   in the F2 generation in a fashion that corresponds to
25 dominant monogenic inheritance: 60 of the 76 F2 plants
   exhibited the RE-resistance pattern.. Table 2 gives a
   detailed overview of the segregation of the R6 resistance
   trait in five F2 populations. Chi-square tests confirmed
   that the observed segregation in the F2 populations was
30 consistent with a 3:1 segregation of the R6 resistance
   profile, as assayed here with resistance to Pfs11.

   Table 2: segregation of the R6 resistance profile in five F2
 5 populations from a cross between a spinach plant of the
   invention (mother) to a father plant of a different
   genotype, which lacked the R6 resistance trait. Chi-square
   tests confirm that the observed numbers of F2 plants that
   were resistant and sensitive were in agreement with what is
10 expected if the trait segregates in a dominant monogenic
   fashion, namely 3:1         (resistant : sensitive).          In all cases
   chi-square values are well above 0.05.
               Similar segregation results were obtained when the
15 progeny of a cross between a plant that carries the R6
   resistance trait and a plant not carrying the said trait
   were assayed for the races Pfsl,             Pfs2, Pfs3, Pfs4, Pfs5,
   Pfs6, Pfs9, Pfs11, Pfsl2, Pfs13 and UA4410, which together
   constitute the R6 resistance profile.
