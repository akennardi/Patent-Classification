                                  COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING PEG AND ASCORBATE
   The present invention relates to a method of cleansing the colon using colon cleansing solutions, and
   compositions and kits associated therewith. Colon cleansing compositions are also known as lavage
   solutions, bowel cleansers, purgatives or colonic evacuants.
 5 1. Background
   Colon or bowel cleansing is important before numerous surgical or diagnostic procedures, including
   colonoscopy, barium enema examination, sigmoidoscopy and colon surgery. Such procedures are
   often carried out on an outpatient basis and thus it is desirable that the colon cleansing be carried out
   by the patient at home, prior to arrival at the hospital or surgery where the procedure is to take place.
 0 It is therefore important that patient compliance is good without medical supervision if satisfactory
   colon cleansing is to be achieved prior to the procedure.
   Intestinal lavage, in which a large volume of an aqueous electrolyte solution containing sodium
   sulphate and polyethylene glycol is ingested, is one of the most common methods for colon cleansing.
   These osmotically active agents are non-absorbable or only poorly absorbable and thus retain water in
 5 the bowel, resulting in copious diarrhoea and cleansing of the colon.
   For effective cleansing, many of these compositions must be ingested in quantities of between 2 to 4
   litres. The unpleasant taste of these compositions combined with the large volumes required to be
   ingested often contributes to nausea or vomiting, resulting in poor patient compliance and failure to
   consume the full volume of solution. Poor patient compliance can lead to inadequate preparation of
 0 the colon which can, in turn, lead to cancellation or repetition of the colonoscopy becoming necessary
   or, worse, non-detection of lesions or polyps indicative of cancer risk.
   A number of improved colon cleansing compositions are described in WO 2004/037292.             A colon
   cleansing composition according to WO 2004/037292 that comprises polyethylene glycol 3350,
   sodium sulphate, an ascorbate component, electrolytes, sweetener and flavouring is commercialised as
25 a powder for oral solution under the tradename MOVIPREP* (registered trademark of Velinor AG, a
   member of the Norgine group of companies). The MOVIPREP solution is effective despite being
   taken in a substantially lower volume than other colon cleansing solutions. Typically, only 2 litres of
   the solution need to be taken by an adult patient (along with additional clear fluid), a significant
   benefit when compared to taking 4 litres of previous solutions.
30 A recent advance in colon cleansing agents is provided by the product marketed as SUPREP by
   Braintree Laboratories, Inc. SUPRPEP contains 17.5g sodium sulphate, 3.13g potassium sulphate and
   1.6g magnesium sulphate and it is taken in a volume of 16 US fluid ounces (473ml). A treatment
   comprises two doses of that solution.
                                                         1

   Various regimens for the timing of ingestion of colon cleansing solutions are mentioned in the
   literature and in patient information leaflets that accompany colon cleansing products. For example,
   the MOVIPREP solution mentioned above may be taken (optionally with additional clear liquids also
   being taken) in the evening before the examination or procedure, or the MOVIPREP solution may be
 5 taken in a "split-dose" regimen, with approximately half of the cleansing solution being taken the
   evening before the examination or procedure ("first dose"), and the remainder being taken the
   following morning ("second dose"). Similarly, the SUPREP product mentioned above is
   recommended to be taken as first dose in the evening before the examination procedure, accompanied
   by an additional quart of water (946ml), followed by a second dose in the morning of the procedure.
 0 An alternative to the lavage solutions described above is provided by low volume hypertonic salt
   solutions. Examples include Fleet's phosphosoda product and sodium picosulphate solutions. These
   are very concentrated salt solutions and patients need ingest only a small volume of them (around
   100ml). However, these products have been associated with a hypo-osmolar state and electrolyte
   imbalance in subjects, particularly hyponatremia. They are particularly counter-indicated in subjects
 5 with kidney problems.
   Despite the advances that have been made, all lavage-type colon cleansing products on the market
   continue to require a subject to ingest a large volume of solution (2 litres in the case of the
   MOVIPREP solution). Many subjects find the ingestion of a large volume unpleasant or difficult and
   poor patient compliance thus remains a problem. There remains a need for alternative colon cleansing
 0 solutions that are effective when ingested in small volumes, but do not cause electrolyte imbalances in
   subjects. There also remains a need for colon cleansing solutions that are more pleasant to subjects to
   ingest, whilst retaining good cleansing effectiveness.
   2. Summary of the invention
   The invention provides, in a first aspect, a colon cleansing solution comprising:
25 a) 300 to 800 mmol per litre ascorbate anion provided by a mixture of:
             (i)     ascorbic acid and
             (ii)    one or more salts of ascorbic acid
             the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1:4.5 to 1:7.0; and
   b) 10 to 200 g per litre polyethylene glycol.
30 The solution of the invention has a surprisingly palatable taste. The particular ratio of ascorbic acid to
   salt of ascorbic acid enables the salty taste of ascorbate salt to be balanced by sourness from acid to a
   palatable extent, whilst at the same time not reducing the osmotic effect of the ascorbate component
                                                         2

   or making the solution too sour. The solution is highly effective as a colon cleansing solution when
   ingested in a lower volume than many prior art solutions, and it has a good tolerability profile.
   3. Detailed description
   a) Contents of solutions
 5 The solutions of the invention are aqueous solutions. The mixture of ascorbic acid and one or more
   salts of ascorbic acid will, for convenience, be referred to herein as the "ascorbate component".
   Suitable salts of ascorbic acid include alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts. For example, a
   salt may be selected from sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium salts. For example, preferred
   salts of ascorbic acid include sodium ascorbate, potassium ascorbate, magnesium ascorbate and
 0 calcium ascorbate. The molar ratio between (i) the ascorbic acid and (ii) the one or more salts of
   ascorbic acid is the molar ratio of the ascorbate moieties; for example, magnesium ascorbate
   comprises two moles of ascorbate per mole of salt; for the ratio purposes, it is the number of moles of
   ascorbate that is counted. Particularly preferred salts of ascorbic acid are magnesium ascorbate and
   sodium ascorbate, for example sodium ascorbate. In one embodiment, the solution comprises
 5 ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate (and preferably no further ascorbate).
   Preferably, the molar ratio of the components (i) and (ii) is from 1:4.75 to 1:6.75; more preferably
   from 1:5.0 to 1:6.0; for example from 1:5.40 to 1:5.80; for example 15:85.
   The solution of the invention preferably comprises ascorbate anion in a concentration of: 300
   700mmol per litre, for example 350-650mmol per litre, for example 450-600 mmol per litre.
 0 A solution of the invention may comprise 50 to 140g/litre of ascorbate component. For example, a
   solution of the invention comprises 60 to 140g/litre, for example 80 to 130g/litre, for example 80 to
   120g/litre, for example 100 to 120g/litre of ascorbate component.
   Ascorbic acid has a molecular weight of 176g/mol. Sodium ascorbate has a molecular weight of
   198g/mol. Accordingly, a mixture of ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate in a molar ratio of from
25 1:4.5 to 1:7.0 has ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate present in a weight ratio of 1:5.063 to 1:7.875.
   For example, the weight ratio can be 1:5.344 to 1:7.594; more preferably from 1:5.625 to 1:6.75; for
   example from 1:6.075 to 1:6.525, for example 1:6.38. For example, a solution of the invention may
   comprise from 6 to 25 g/litre of ascorbic acid and 50 to 120 g/litre of sodium ascorbate, for example
   12 to 20 g/litre of ascorbic acid and 80 to 120 g/litre of sodium ascorbate (with the ratio between them
30 being as mentioned above). For example, a solution of the invention may comprise from 14 to 16g
   g/litre of ascorbic acid and 92 to 100 g/litre of sodium ascorbate.
   Potassium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 214g/mol. Accordingly, a mixture of ascorbic acid
   and potassium ascorbate in a molar ratio of from 1:4.5 to 1:7.0 has ascorbic acid and potassium
                                                         3

   ascorbate present in a weight ratio of 1:5.471 to 1:8.511. For example, the weight ratio can be 1:5.776
   to 1:8.208; more preferably from 1:6.080 to 1:7.295; for example from 1:6.565 to 1:7.052, for
   example 1:6.896. For example, a solution of the invention may comprise from 6 to 25 g/litre of
   ascorbic acid and 50 to 125 g/litre of potassium ascorbate, for example 6 to 12 g/litre of ascorbic acid
 5 and 80 to 120 g/litre of potassium ascorbate.
   Magnesium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 374.5g/mol and each mole of magnesium ascorbate
   provides two moles of ascorbate. Accordingly, a mixture of ascorbic acid and magnesium ascorbate
   in a molar ratio of from 1:4.5 to 1:7.0 (of ascorbate anion) has ascorbic acid and magnesium ascorbate
   present in a weight ratio of 1:4.794 to 1:7.457. For example, the weight ratio can be 1:5.061 to
 0 1:7.191; more preferably from 1:5.326 to 1:6.397 for example from 1:5.753 to 1:6.179, for example
   1:6.042. For example, a solution of the invention may comprise from 6 to 25 g/litre of ascorbic acid
   and 45 to 120 g/litre of magnesium ascorbate, for example 6 to 12 g/litre of ascorbic acid and 75 to
   115 g/litre of magnesium ascorbate.
   Depending on the pH of the solution, some ascorbate anion may be protonated and thus exist as free
 5 ascorbic acid in solution. At the pH of solutions that would typically be administered, only a very
   minor proportion of ascorbate is protonated. In calculations of concentrations of "ascorbate anion"
   herein, the concentration of "ascorbate anion" is taken as the total concentration of all ascorbate anion
   present, including the proportion that is protonated.
   The cleansing solution comprises polyethylene glycol. The polyethylene glycol (PEG) may, for
 0 example, have an average molecular weight of 2000 to 8000, for example 2500 to 4500 Da, for
   example 2680 to 4020 Da, for example 3000 to 4000 Da. For example, the PEG may be PEG 3350 or
   PEG 4000 as defined in national pharmacopeias. PEG8000 may also be used. Further examples of
   suitable PEGs recognized in some national pharmacopeias include Macrogols, for example Macrogol
   3350 or Macrogol 4000.
25 The cleansing solution comprises 10 to 200 g per litre of PEG. Preferably, the solution comprises 20
   to 160g per litre of PEG, more preferably 40 to 120 g per litre, for example 60 to 100 g per litre, for
   example 75 to 85 g per litre, for example 80 g per litre.
   The cleansing solution may additionally comprise one or more of:
   c) one or more electrolytes;
30 d) one or more alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphates;
   e) one or more flavouring agents;
   f) one or more sweeteners.
                                                        4

   The cleansing solution may comprise one or more electrolytes. Electrolytes include salts of sodium,
   potassium, calcium and magnesium, particularly sodium and potassium; and salts of chloride, iodide,
   bicarbonate and carbonate, particularly chloride. Preferred electrolytes are sodium chloride and
   potassium chloride. In an embodiment, the solution is essentially free from sodium bicarbonate, for
 5 example essentially free from any bicarbonate.
   For example, the solution may comprise sodium chloride at a concentration of 1 to 10 g per litre. For
   example, sodium chloride may be present at a concentration of 3 to 8 g per litre, for example 4 to 7g
   per litre; for example 6.0 to 6.8g per litre; for example 5.6g per litre or 6.4g per litre.
   For example, the solution may comprise potassium chloride at a concentration of I to 10 g per litre.
 0 For example, potassium chloride may be present at a concentration of 1 to 7 g per litre, for example
   1.5 to 5g per litre, for example 1.5 to 3g per litre, for example 2.0 to 2.8 g per litre; for example 2.4g
   per litre or 2.6g per litre.
   In an embodiment, the solution comprises sodium chloride and potassium chloride. They can be
   present in the amounts mentioned immediately above. For example, sodium chloride may be present
 5 at a concentration of 4 to 7g per litre and potassium chloride may be present at a concentration of 1.5
   to 3g per litre.
   The cleansing solution may comprise one or more alkali metal sulphates, alkaline earth metal
   sulphates or a mixture thereof (herein referred to as a "sulphate component"). An alkali metal or
   alkaline earth metal sulphate may, for example, be selected from sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate
 0 and magnesium sulphate. The solution may comprise more than one of sodium sulphate, potassium
   sulphate and magnesium sulphate, for example all three. Preferably, the sulphate component is or
   includes sodium sulphate.
   For example, the solution may comprise a sulphate component at a concentration of 2 to 20 g per litre,
   for example 5 to 15 g per litre, for example 8 to 15 g per litre, for example 10 to 14 g per litre, for
25 example 12 g per litre. The one or more sulphate salts may be provided in any pharmaceutically
   acceptable form: they may each be anhydrous, or be in a hydrated form. The weights mentioned
   herein refer to the weight of the sulphate salt excluding any water of hydration.
   In an alternative preferred embodiment, the solution does not comprise a sulphate component; that is
   to say that the solution is essentially free from alkali metal sulphates and alkaline earth metal
30 sulphates; in particular essentially free from sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate and magnesium
   sulphate.
                                                          5

   Herein, the term "essentially free from" a component means that the named component is present at a
   level that is below the level that has any functional effect in the solution of the invention in its use; for
   example, the named component may be at a level that is below the level at which it has a measurable
   clinical effect. For example, it may mean that the component is present at a level of less than 0.1g per
 5 litre; for example less than 0.03g per litre; for example less than 0.01g per litre, for example less than
   0.003g per litre, for example less than 0.001g per litre.
   In the solutions of the invention described herein, the quantities of the individual components recited
   do not include any solutes that may be present in the water used to prepare the solutions, for example,
   in hard water areas there may be significant amounts of Ca2+ and Mg 2 + carbonates, bicarbonates or
 0 sulphates present in tap water.
   The cleansing solution preferably includes a flavouring agent. A flavouring for use in compositions
   of the invention should preferably mask saltiness, be relatively sweet but not excessively so, and be
   stable in the composition. A flavouring makes the solutions more palatable and thus aids patient
   compliance. Preferred flavourings include lemon e.g. Ungerer Lemon (available from Ungerer
 5 Limited, Sealand Road, Chester, England CHI 4LP), strawberry e.g. Ungerer Strawberry, grapefruit
   e.g. Ungerer Grapefruit flavouring powder, blackcurrant e.g. Ungerer Blackcurrant, pineapple e.g. IFF
   (International Flavours and Fragrances) Pineapple flavouring powder, orange eg Firmenich Orange,
   vanilla/lemon and lime e.g. IFF Vanilla and Givaudin Roure Lemon and Lime Flav-o-lok, fruit punch
   eg Ungerer fruit punch, citrus punch, mango, and berry. Those and further suitable flavourings are
 0 available from International Flavours and Fragrances Inc. (Duddery Hill, Haverhill, Suffolk, CB9
   8LG, England), Ungerer & Company (Sealand Road, Chester, England CHI 4LP) or Firmenich
   (Firmenich UK Ltd., Hayes Road, Southall, Middlesex UB2 5NN). More preferred flavourings are
   lemon, kiwi, strawberry, grapefruit, orange, fruit punch and mango. Citrus flavour, orange grapefruit
   flavour and orange flavour are particularly preferred.
25 The amount of flavouring required depends on the nature and strength of the flavouring in question.
   Typically, it is 0.05 to 4.5 g per litre, for example 0.05 to 2.0 g per litre, for example 0.2 to 1.8g per
   litre, for example 1.0 to 1.8g per litre, for example 3.0 to 4.5g per litre, for example 0.3g per litre or
   1.2g per litre, for example 3.2 or 4.2g per litre.
   The cleansing solution preferably includes a sweetener. Sugar-based sweeteners are generally not
30 suited for colon cleansing compositions because the delivery of unabsorbed sugars to the colon
   provides a substrate for bacteria. Such sugars may be metabolised by the bacteria to form explosive
   gases such as hydrogen and methane. The presence of explosive gases in the colon can be highly
   dangerous when electrical apparatus is to be used during colonoscopy or other procedures. Preferred
   sweeteners include aspartame, acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K), sucralose and saccharine, and/
                                                         6

    or combinations thereof. For example, compositions of the invention may comprise one or both of
    aspartame and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). For example, compositions of the invention
    may comprise one or both of sucralose and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). In a preferred
    embodiment, the solution comprises aspartame or sucralose, for example aspartame.
  5 Alternatively, compositions of the invention can be essentially free from added sweeteners, for
    example to minimize the number of different components in the compositions.
    A souring agent (for example citric acid) may be present as a taste enhancer. A souring agent is a
    component that imparts a sourness to a composition. Other souring agents include malic acid, acetic
    acid, tartaric acid, gluconodeltalactone, phosphoric acid, succinic acid, phytic acid, lactic acid or salts
  0 thereof. The souring agent (for example citric acid) may be provided in an encapsulated form. The
    encapsulation provides a coating that isolates the souring agent from other components and from air
    and moisture prior to its use. Several encapsulated forms of citric acid, or other souring agents, are
    commercially available. For example, the encapsulation may be with a water-soluble coating.
    The amount of sweetener required depends on the nature and strength of the sweetener being
  5 considered. Typically, it is 0.10 to 4 g per litre. For example, the sweetener may be aspartame at 0.5
    to 4g per litre, for example 2.5 to 4.0 g per litre, for example 3.Og per litre, for example 3.86g per litre.
    Those quantities of aspartame are particularly suitable when used with orange flavouring, for example
    orange flavouring at 0.2 to 1.8g per litre, for example 1.0 to 1.8g per litre, for example 0.3g per litre,
    0.875g per litre or 1.2g per litre. For example, the sweetener may be aspartame at 1.0 to 2.5g per litre,
 ,0 for example 1.5 to 2.0g per litre, for example 1.75g per litre.
    The invention thus provides a colon cleansing solution comprising:
    a) 300 to 800 mmol per litre ascorbate anion provided by a mixture of
             (i)       ascorbic acid and
             (ii)      one or more salts of ascorbic acid
25           the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1:4.5 to 1:7.0;
    b) 10 to 200 g per litre PEG.
    c) one or more electrolytes;
    d) optionally one or more alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphates;
    e) optionally one or more flavouring agents; and
30  f) optionally one or more sweeteners.
    It will be apparent to the reader of this specification, that the term "comprising" and grammatical
    variations thereof, in relation to embodiments of the invention described, may be substituted in all
    cases (unless the context dictates otherwise) with the term "consisting essentially of' or "consisting
                                                           7

   of'. In the case of a solution that "consists of' or "consists essentially of' the stated components, the
   balance is in each case made up of water.
   In particular, the invention provides a colon cleansing solution comprising:
   a) 300 to 800 mmol per litre ascorbate anion provided by a mixture of
 5          (i)      ascorbic acid and
            (ii)     one or more salts of ascorbic acid
            the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1:4.5 to 1:7.0;
   b) 10 to 200 g per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da;
   c) sodium chloride and potassium chloride;
 0 d) optionally sodium sulphate;
   e) optionally one or more flavouring agents; and
   f) optionally one or more sweeteners.
   Each of c) and d) may be present in the concentrations described above. Each of e) and f) may be as
   described above and/or be in the concentrations described above.
 5 In particular, the invention provides a colon cleansing solution comprising:
   a) 300 to 800 mmol per litre ascorbate anion provided by a mixture of
            (i)      ascorbic acid and
            (ii)     one or more salts of ascorbic acid
            the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1:4.5 to 1:7.0;
 0 b) 10 to 200 g per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da;
   c) sodium chloride and potassium chloride;
   e) one or more flavouring agents; and
   f) one or more sweeteners.
   In one embodiment, one or more components of c), d) (when present), e) and f) are present in the
25 solution. In an alternative presentation, some or all of components c), d) (when present), e) and f)
   may be provided separately from the solution, for example in a tablet or capsule. For example,
   components c) and d) may be provided in tablet form. In an embodiment, the solution may comprise
   a) the ascorbate component and b) PEG, and optional flavouring and sweetener (e) and f)), and a
   tablet or capsule may comprise c) the one or more electrolytes (optionally with d), the one or more
30 alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphates), again with optional flavouring and sweetener (e) and f).
   The flavouring and sweeteners need not be the same in the tablet or capsule as in the solution.
                                                         8

   In one embodiment, the invention provides a colon cleansing solution comprising:
   a)
             (i)      12 to 20g per litre ascorbic acid and
             (ii)     80 to 120g per litre sodium ascorbate
 5           the components (i) and (ii) being present in a weight ratio of from 1:5063 to 1:7.875;
   b) 60 to 1Og per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da;
   c) 3 to 8g per litre sodium chloride and 1 to 7g per litre potassium chloride;
   e) one or more flavouring agents; and
   f) one or more sweeteners.
 0 In an embodiment, the solution consists essentially of those components; that is to say that it does not
   contain any further components in significant quantities. The solution may, for example, not contain
   any sulphate.
   For example, the invention provides a colon cleansing solution consisting essentially of:
   a)
 5           (i)      14 to 16g per litre ascorbic acid and
             (ii)    92 to 1OOg per litre sodium ascorbate
   b) 75 to 85 per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da;
   c) 6.0 to 6.8g per litre sodium chloride and 2.0 to 2.8g per litre potassium chloride;
   e) one or more flavouring agents; and
 0 f) one or more sweeteners.
   For example, the invention provides a colon cleansing solution consisting essentially of:

   Preferably, the colon cleansing solution is hyper-osmotic. That is to say that it has a higher osmotic
   strength than blood in the human body. It may, for example have a measured osmolality in the range
   500 to 2000 mOsmol/kg. For example, the osmolality may be in the range 700 to 1800 mOsmol/kg.
   For example, the solutes in 500ml of the solution may have a measured V(350) value of from 1000 to
 5 2000ml, for example from 1300 to 2000ml, for example from 1400 to 1900ml, and be in a volume of
   400 to 600ml, for example 500ml. The V(350) value is the volume of water that is required to
   provide a solution with an osmolality of 350mOsmol/kg, the total volume being the final volume after
   a volume water has been added to a solution having an initial volume.
   Osmolality can be measured in various ways. In general, either freezing point depression or vapour
 0 pressure alteration is used. For example, an Advanced Instruments, Inc Model 3250 osmometer (a
   freezing point depression device) can be used. Vapour pressure measurement can also be used, for
   example using an ELITech Group Vapro 5600 device. Osmolality values cited herein are preferably
   taken to be values measured using a freezing point depression osmometer, for example using an
   Advanced Instruments, Inc Model 3250 osmometer following standard operating procedure.
 5 The invention provides a colon cleansing solution comprising:
   a) 300 to 800 mmol per litre ascorbate anion provided by a mixture of
             (i)     ascorbic acid and
             (ii)    one or more salts of ascorbic acid
             the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1:4.5 to 1:7.0; and
 0 b) 10 to 200 g per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da;
   and 500ml of the solution having a V(350) osmolality value of from 1300 to 2300ml.
   For example, 500ml of the solution may have a V(350) osmolality value of from 1500 to 2100ml, for
   example from 1700 to 2000ml, for example from 1800 to 1900ml.
25 b) Additional optional contents of solutions
   Unless it is stated otherwise, the solutions of the invention may include one or more additional
   optional components:
   (i) antioxidants
   In general it is not necessary for the solutions to include preservatives or anti-oxidants. Nevertheless,
30 low levels of anti-oxidants or preservatives may be used if required.
   (ii) laxatives
   In general, the solutions described herein are effective without the need for any additional active
                                                         10

   ingredients. Nevertheless, a further active ingredient may be included if required. For example, a
   laxative may be present, for example a stimulant laxative. For example, bisacodyl, castor oil, senna or
   bisoxatin may be used. An example of a colon cleansing solution containing bisoxatin is known from
   W02013001315.
 5 (iii) Contrast media
   For certain uses, one or more contrast media can be included in a solution of the invention.
   Examples of contrast media include barium or iodine products, diatrizoate (marketed, for example, as
   HYPAQUE 50), metrizoate (marketed, for example, as ISOPAQUE 370), ioxalgate (marketed, for

   diacetamido-2,4,6-triiodobenzoic acid; marketed, for example, as HYPAQUE). Alternatively, the
   solution of the invention may be used in conjunction with (e.g., simultaneously, before or after)
 5 administration of a contrast agent or contrast media.
   (iv) Dyes and stains.
   For certain uses (eg fluorescence endoscopy), one or more dyes or stains that are markers of particular
   mucosal pathology can be included in a solution of the invention. Stains may be selective . For
   example, hexaminolevulinate may be used, for example as its HCl salt (marketed as CYSVIEW).
 0 Other markers of colonic or rectal mucosal pathology can be used. For example methylene blue,
   which can stain the normal mucosa yet polyps do not stain and become more clearly visible.
   Further dyes and stains that may be mentioned include: Curcumin, Riboflavin, Riboflavin-5'
   phosphate, Tartrazine, Quinoline Yellow, Sunset Yellow, FCF Orange, Yellow S, Cochineal,

 5 Alternatively, the solution of the invention may be used in conjunction with (e.g., simultaneously,
   before or after) administration of a dye or stain. A dye or a stain may be provided in slow or delayed
   release form, for example delayed release methylene blue (for example MMX format of colonic
   released methylene blue) may be mentioned.
   (v) Surfactants
 0 A surfactant may be included in a solution of the invention. A surfactant may assist in avoiding the
   persistence of bubbles in the colon. Such bubbles can interfere with the visualisation of features of
   the colon during colonoscopy. Surfactants that may be mentioned include simethicone (or any
   mixture of polydimethylsiloxane and silica gel), dimethicone. Bowel cleansing solutions containing
   simethicone are described in W02009052256.
 5 (vi) Lubricants
   A lubricant may be included in a solution of the invention. The inclusion of a lubricant can help with
   a colonoscope insertion and facilitation within the performance of the colonoscopy. Suitable
   lubricants include glycerol or silicone.
   (vii) Biofilm-disrupting compounds
 0 A biofilm disrupting compound may be included in a solution of the invention. A compound that
   disrupts biofilms may assist in separating an adherent polysaccharide DNA - containing layer, the so
   called "biofilm" from the colonic mucosa. Removal of that layer may assist in achieving a cleaner
   and/or more easily visualized or stained mucosa.
   Biofilm-disrupting components or agents that may be mentioned include enzymes such as
25 deoxyribonuclease (DNase), N-acetylcysteine, alginate lyase, glycoside hydrolase dispersin B;
   Quorum-sensing inhibitors e.g., ribonucleic acid III inhibiting peptide, Salvadora persica extracts,
   Competence-stimulating peptide, Patulin and penicillic acid; peptides - cathelicidin-derived peptides,
   small lytic peptide, PTP-7 (a small lytic peptide, see e.g., haridia (201 1) J. Microbiol. 49(4):663-8,
   Epub 201 1 Sep 2), Nitric oxide, neo- emulsions; ozone, lytic bacteriophages, lactoferrin, xylitol
30 hydrogel, synthetic iron chelators, cranberry components, curcumin, silver nanoparticles, Acetyl- 1 1
   keto-P-boswellic acid (AKBA), barley coffee components, probiotics, sinefungin, S
   adenosylmethionine, S- adenosyl-homocysteine, Delisea furanones, N-sulfonyl homoserine lactones
   and/or macrolide antibiotics or any combination thereof.
                                                       12

   Alternatively, the solution of the invention may be used in conjunction with (e.g., simultaneously,
   before or after) administration of a biofilm-disrupting compound. A biofilm-disrupting compound
   may be administered towards the end of ingestion of the solution of the invention, or shortly after
   completion of ingestion of the solution of the invention, so as to disrupt the biofilm most just before
 5 the colonoscopy.
   (viii) Organic acids
   Some of the osmotic load of the solution of the invention may be provided by an organic acid or salts
   of an organic acid other than ascorbic acid. For example, citric acid and/or salts thereof may replace
   some or all of the ascorbate in solutions of the invention. Throughout this description, ascorbic acid
 0 may be replaced with citric acid. A salt of ascorbate may be replaced with the salt of citrate. Sodium
   citrate, potassium citrate and magnesium citrate are particularly preferred.
   c) Uses of solutions of the invention
   The solutions of the invention find use in cleansing the colon or bowel. They are also useful in the
 5 treatment of faecal impaction or constipation.
   When carrying out a bowel cleansing treatment, a subject typically takes a single dose or a split dose
   of cleansing solution. In a split-dose treatment, typically two doses are taken separated by a time
   interval, for example an overnight interval. Alternatively, in a split-dose treatment two doses may be
   taken on the same day, for example during the day before a therapeutic or surgical procedure, or
 0 during the day of a therapeutic or surgical procedure. Each dose in a split dose treatment is smaller
   than the dose in the single dose treatment. In a split dose treatment, the two doses may each have the
   same composition, or they may be different.
   For a single dose treatment, the solution of the invention may be ingested in a volume of 700 to
   1500ml. For example, the subject may ingest from 750ml to 1300ml of the solution, for example 800
25 to 1200ml, for example 900 to 1100 ml, for example 1000ml. For example 33 or 34 US fluid ounces
   may be ingested. In an embodiment, the subject may ingest some additional clear fluid. The
   additional clear fluid may be ingested after ingesting the solution. Alternatively, the additional clear
   fluid may be co-administered with the intake of the solution of the invention. By "co-administered" is
   meant the coordinated ingestion of a solution of the invention with clear fluid; that is to say that the
30 subject ingests some of the solution of the invention but not necessarily the whole dose, then some
   clear fluid and then more solution of the invention.
   For a split dose treatment, the solution of the invention may be taken as one or both of the doses, each
   dose having a volume of 200 to 1000ml. For example, the subject may ingest (as one of the doses)
                                                        13

   300ml to 1000ml of the solution, for example 300ml to 900ml, for example 300ml to 800ml, for
   example 400ml to 700ml, for example 400 to 600ml, for example 450 to 550 ml, for example 500ml.
   For example 16 or 17 US fluid ounces may be ingested.
   The combined volume of the first and second doses is preferably less than 2 litres. Preferably, it is
 5 1750ml or less, for example 1500ml or less, for example 1250ml or less. For most adult subjects, a
   combined volume of more than 500ml is used, for example more than 750ml. For example, a
   combined volume of from 500ml to 1750ml is used, for example from 750ml to 1500ml, for example
   from 1000ml to 1500ml, for example 1000ml or 1250ml. For example the first dose may have a
   volume of 500ml (for example a volume of 16 or 17 US fluid ounces) or 750ml (for example a
 0 volume of 25 or 26 US fluid ounces) and the second dose may have a volume of 500ml (for example a
   volume of 16 or 17 US fluid ounces).
   In an embodiment, the subject may ingest some additional clear fluid with each or either dose of colon
   cleansing solution. The additional clear fluid may be taken after ingesting a dose of the solution.
   Alternatively, the additional clear fluid may be co-administered with the intake of a dose of the
 5 solution of the invention; that is to say that the subject ingests some of the solution of the invention
   but not necessarily the whole dose, then some clear fluid and then more solution of the invention.
   In the method, there is typically a time interval between ingesting the first dose and ingesting the
   second dose. Generally, the time interval is at least 4 hours, for example 6 hours or more, for example
   8 hours or more. Typically, the time interval is less than 15 hours. The time interval between starting
 0 to take the first dose and starting to take the second dose may be, for example, the time between an
   evening and the following morning, for example 12 to 16 hours, for example 14 hours. For example,
   the subject may sleep (for example overnight) between taking the first and second doses.
   Alternatively, the time interval between ingesting the first dose and ingesting the second dose can be
   at least 10 minutes, for example from 10 minutes to 4 hours, for example from 30 minutes to 4 hours,
25 for example from 30 minutes to two hours. For example, the subject may ingest the first and second
   colon doses the evening before a surgical or diagnostic procedure. The time interval between
   ingesting the first solution and ingesting the second solution can be determined by the time it takes for
   the subject to experience a bowel movement. For example the subject takes the second dose when the
   first bowel movement has occurred after completing ingestion of the first solution. Alternatively, the
30 subject ingests the second dose when the first bowel movement has occurred even if ingestion of the
   first dose is not complete.
   During the ingestion of the first or second dose, or during the time interval between the ingestion of
   the first dose and the second dose, the subject may additionally take a stimulant laxative (also known
   as a prokinetic agent). A stimulant laxative can assist in bringing about good cleansing. Examples of
                                                         14

    stimulant laxatives include contact laxatives, for example bisacodyl, castor oil, senna or bisoxatin.
    Examples of stimulant laxatives also include additional osmotic agents for example magnesium salts,
    for example magnesium citrate. If a stimulant laxative is included in the regimen, the length of the
    time interval can be shortened. For example, it may be 10 minutes to 15 hours, for example I to 15
  5 hours, for example I to 12 hours, for example 2 to 10 hours.
    During the time interval between the administration of the first dose and the second dose, it is very
    likely that the subject will experience a bowel movement. Advantageously, the subject waits until the
    bowel movement has occurred before taking the second dose.
    In a split dose treatment, the solution of the invention may be taken for one or for both of the doses.
  0 Preferably, the solution of the invention is taken as the second solution. For example, the subject may
    ingest 300ml to 1000ml of the solution of the invention as the second solution, for example 300ml to
    900ml, for example 300ml to 800ml, for example 400ml to 700ml, for example 400 to 600ml, for
    example 450 to 550 ml, for example 500ml. For example 16 or 17 US fluid ounces may be ingested.
    The first solution may be a solution of different constitution from the second solution. Thus, in a
  5 preferred embodiment of a split dose bowel cleansing treatment, a subject takes a dose of an initial
    cleansing solution, optionally followed by some additional clear fluid. After an interval, the subject
    then takes a dose of the solution of the invention, optionally followed by some additional clear fluid.
    The volume of clear fluid that a subject ingests after the first or second dose may be in a range with a
    lower limit of 100ml, 200ml, 300ml, 400ml or 500ml. Preferably, the lower limit is 300ml, 400ml or
 ,0 500ml. The volume may be in a range with an upper limit of 1200ml, 11 00ml, l000ml, 900ml or
    800ml. For example the volume may be in the range l00ml to 1200ml, for example 200ml to 11 00ml,
    for example 300ml to 1000ml, for example 500ml to 900ml, for example 1000ml, for example 875ml,
    for example 500ml to 800ml. For example the volume may be in the range 300 ml to 900 ml, for
    example 400 ml to 800 ml, for example 500 ml to 800 ml. The additional clear fluid may be ingested
25  in a volume of at least 500 ml. For example it may be at least 16 or 17 US fluid ounces. The
    instructions provided to the subject may suggest that the additional clear fluid is ingested over a
    period of approximately one hour, for example in 150 to 200ml fractions every 15 to 20 minutes. The
    additional clear fluid may be taken after taking a dose of the solution. Alternatively, the additional
    clear fluid may be co-administered with the intake of a dose of the solution of the invention; for
30  example, the subject may ingest clear fluid between fractions of the solution of the invention; for
    example the subject may ingest a cup of the solution of the invention, followed by a cup of clear fluid,
    followed by further cups of the solution of the invention.
    A clear fluid for taking as the additional clear fluid, or for use as the clear fluid when making up a
    solution, may be any fluid that allows inspection of colonic output. The clear fluid should also not
                                                          15

   impede inspection of the colon during the colonoscopy. Typically the clear fluid is a water-based
   beverage, including, for example, water, lemonade, cola drinks, cordial drinks, clear fruit juices and
   even clear alcohol-containing beverages, for example beer. It is desirable that the clear fluid does not
   contain substantial amounts of or essentially any dietary fibre, as such fibre interferes with the
 5 cleansing of the colon according to the present invention. Accordingly, fruit juices, for example
   orange juice and kiwi juice, and fruit "squashes" should be strained before use. Clear fruit cordials,
   for example lime cordial or tea (for example green tea), are generally suitable. In view of the
   desirability of avoiding drinks containing glucose, so as to reduce the risk of explosive concentrations
   of hydrogen or methane building up in the gut, "diet" drinks containing no or low sugar are especially
 0 suitable, for example liquid drinks for diabetics, diet Coke (RTM), diet lemonade, dietary carbonated
   drinks or dietary cordials. The most preferred clear fluid is water.
   The method of the invention may be used to cleanse the colon prior to carrying out a diagnostic,
   therapeutic or surgical procedure on the colon, rectum or anus or elsewhere in the abdomen in a
   subject. The subject is most preferably a human. The diagnostic or surgical procedure may, for
 5 example, be colonoscopy (such as cap-assisted colonoscopy and/or narrow-band colonoscopy),
   barium enema examination, sigmoidoscopy (for example flexible sigmoidoscopy) or colon surgery.
   The method of the invention may be a method of cleansing the colon prior to a surgical or diagnostic
   procedure comprising administering the first solution and then after a time interval administering the
   second solution prior to said procedure.

   ounce dose). The invention provides a composition for admixture with water, wherein the
   composition is optionally presented in two or more parts and comprises:
   a) 150 to 400 mmol ascorbate anion provided by a mixture of:
             (i)     ascorbic acid and

   the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1:4.5 to 1:7.0; and
   b) 5 to 100 g polyethylene glycol.
   For example, the components may be in dry powder, granular or other dry form. They may
   alternatively be in the form of concentrates or slurries. Components may be in the same or different
25 physical forms. For example, the composition is a dry composition, for example a dry powder
   composition. For example, one or both of components a) and b) are dry powders. In a dry powder, it
   is possible for one or more components to be a salt hydrate.
   As set out above in section 3a), the ascorbate anion is provided by a mixture of ascorbic acid and one
   or more salts of ascorbic acid. Preferred forms of the ascorbate component are as set out above in

   Ascorbic acid has a molecular weight of 176g/mol and sodium ascorbate has a molecular weight of
   198g/mol. Accordingly, the 150 to 400 mmol ascorbate anion can be provided by 3.3 to 12.8g
   ascorbic acid and 24.3 to 69g sodium ascorbate, for example 5.0 to 1Og ascorbic acid and 40 to 60g

   example 5.0 to 1Og ascorbic acid and 45 to 65g potassium ascorbate; for example 7.0 to 8.Og ascorbic
 0 acid and 47 to 56g sodium ascorbate.
   Magnesium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 374.5g/mol and each mole of magnesium ascorbate
   provides two moles of ascorbate. Accordingly, the 150 to 400 mmol ascorbate anion can be provided
   by 3.3 to 12.8g ascorbic acid and 23 to 65g magnesium ascorbate, for example 5.0 to 1Og ascorbic
   acid and 38 to 57g magnesium ascorbate; for example 7.0 to 8.Og ascorbic acid and 42 to 49g
 5 magnesium ascorbate.
   In solid form, ascorbic acid is typically made up of protonated free ascorbic acid. In calculations of
   concentrations of "ascorbate anion" herein, the number of moles of "ascorbate anion" is taken as the
   total concentration of all ascorbate anion present, including the proportion that is protonated.
   The weight of the ascorbate component may be 20 to 85g, for example 25 to 75g, for example 20 to
 0 60g, for example 50 to 60g.
   In an embodiment, the ascorbate component comprises (or consists essentially of) sodium ascorbate
   and ascorbic acid. For example, they may be present in a total amount and in a weight ratio as
   mentioned immediately above.
   Preferred forms of the PEG are as set out above in section 3a), in relation to solutions of the invention.
25 The composition comprises 5 to 100 g of PEG. Preferably, the composition comprises 10 to 80g of
   PEG, more preferably 20 to 60g, for example 30 to 50g, for example 37.5 to 42.5g, for example 40 g

   Preferred electrolytes are as set out above in section 3a), in relation to solutions of the invention. For
   example, the composition may comprise sodium chloride in an amount of 0.5 to 5g, for example 1.5
   to 4 g, for example 2.0 to 3.5g, for example 2.8g or 3.2g. For example, the composition may
   comprise potassium chloride in an amount of 0.5 to 5g, for example 0.5 to 3.5 g, for example 0.75 to
 5 2.5g, for example 0.75 to 1.5g,for example 1.0 to 1.4g, for example 1.2g or 1.3g. In an embodiment,
   the composition is essentially free from sodium bicarbonate, for example essentially free from any
   bicarbonate.
   Preferred alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphates are as set out above in section 3a), in relation

   of the sulphate salt excluding any water of hydration. A hydrate form may be present in the dry
   powder composition, and that composition is still considered "dry" herein. In an alternative preferred
 5 embodiment, the composition does not comprise a sulphate component; that is to say that the
   composition is essentially free from alkali metal sulphates and alkaline earth metal sulphates; in
   particular essentially free from sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate and magnesium sulphate.
   Preferred flavouring agents are as set out above in section 3a), in relation to solutions of the invention.

   5. Detailed description
   a) Contents of solutions
   The solutions of the invention are aqueous solutions. Suitable salts of ascorbic acid include alkali
   metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts. For example a salt may be selected from sodium,
 5 potassium, magnesium and calcium salts. For example, preferred salts of ascorbic acid include
   sodium ascorbate, potassium ascorbate, magnesium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate. Particularly
   preferred salts of ascorbic acid are magnesium ascorbate and sodium ascorbate, for example sodium
   ascorbate. In one embodiment, the solution comprises sodium ascorbate and no further ascorbate.
   The solution of the invention preferably comprises ascorbate anion in a concentration of: 370
 0 43Ommol per litre, for example 380-420mmol per litre, for example 400-410 mmol per litre.
   A solution of the invention may comprise 72 to 88g/litre of ascorbate salt. For example, a solution of
   the invention comprises 75 to 85g/litre, for example 78 to 82g/litre, for example 80g/litre.
   Sodium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 198g/mol. Accordingly, a solution of the invention may
   comprise sodium ascorbate at 71.3 - 87.1g per litre, for example 73.3-85.lg per litre for example
25 75.2-83.2g per litre, for example 79.2-80.2g per litre.
   Potassium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 214g/mol. Accordingly, a solution of the invention

   per litre, for example 85.6-86.7g per litre.
   Magnesium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 374.5g/mol and each mole of magnesium ascorbate
30 provides two moles of ascorbate. Accordingly, a solution of the invention may comprise magnesium
   ascorbate at 67.4-82.4g per litre, for example 69.3-80.5g per litre, for example 71.2-78.6g per litre, for
   example 74.9-75.8g per litre.
                                                         29

   Depending on the pH of the solution, some ascorbate anion may be protonated and thus exist as free
   ascorbic acid in solution. At the pH of solutions that would typically be administered, only a minor
   proportion of ascorbate is protonated. In calculations of concentrations of "ascorbate anion" herein,
   the concentration of "ascorbate anion" is taken as the total concentration of all ascorbate anion
 5 present, including the proportion that is protonated.
   The cleansing solution comprises polyethylene glycol. The polyethylene glycol (PEG) may be as
   described above in section 3a). The cleansing solution comprises 10 to 200 g per litre of PEG.

   bicarbonate and carbonate, particularly chloride. Preferred electrolytes are sodium chloride and
   potassium chloride. In an embodiment, the solution is essentially free from sodium bicarbonate, for
   example essentially free from any bicarbonate.
 0 For example, the solution may comprise sodium chloride at a concentration of I to 10 g per litre. For
   example, sodium chloride may be present at a concentration of 3 to 8 g per litre, for example 4 to 7g
   per litre; for example 4.5 to 5.5g per litre; for example 5.Og per litre or 5.6g per litre.
   For example, the solution may comprise potassium chloride at a concentration of I to 10 g per litre.
   For example, potassium chloride may be present at a concentration of 1 to 7 g per litre, for example
25 1.5 to 5g per litre, for example 1.5 to 3g per litre, for example 1.7 to 2.8 g per litre; for example 1.8g
   per litre or 2.6g per litre.

   sulphates; in particular essentially free from sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate and magnesium
   sulphate.
   In the solutions of the invention described herein, the quantities of the individual components recited
   do not include any solutes that may be present in the water used to prepare the solutions, for example,
 0 in hard water areas there may be significant amounts of Ca2+ and Mg 2 + carbonates, bicarbonates or
   sulphates present in tap water.
   The cleansing solution preferably includes a flavouring agent. The flavouring may be as described
   above in section 3a). Lemon/lime flavour and orange flavour are particularly preferred.
   The amount of flavouring required depends on the nature and strength of the flavouring in question.
 5 Typically, it is 0.05 to 4.5 g per litre, for example 0.05 to 2.0 g per litre, for example 0.5 to 1.8g per

 0 Alternatively, compositions of the invention can be essentially free from added sweeteners, for
   example to minimize the number of different components in the compositions.
   A souring agent (for example citric acid) may be present as a taste enhancer. A souring agent is a
   component that imparts a sourness to a composition. Other souring agents include malic acid, acetic
   acid, tartaric acid, gluconodeltalactone, phosphoric acid, succinic acid, phytic acid, lactic acid or salts
25 thereof. The souring agent (for example citric acid) may be provided in an encapsulated form. The
   encapsulation provides a coating that isolates the souring agent from other components and from air
   and moisture prior to its use. Several encapsulated forms of citric acid, or other souring agents, are
   commercially available. For example, the encapsulation may be with a water-soluble coating.
   The amount of sweetener required depends on the nature and strength of the sweetener being
30 considered. Typically, it is 0.10 to 4 g per litre. For example, the sweetener may be aspartame at 0.5
   to 4g per litre, for example 2.5 to 4.0 g per litre, for example 2.Og per litre, for example 2.2g per litre
   or 3.25g per litre. Those quantities of aspartame are particularly suitable when used with orange
                                                          31

   (v)       optionally one or more sweeteners.
   The first colon cleansing solution may comprise one or more electrolytes. Electrolytes include salts
 5 of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, particularly sodium and potassium; and salts of
   chloride, iodide, bicarbonate and carbonate, particularly chloride. Preferred electrolytes are sodium
   chloride and potassium chloride. In an embodiment, sodium bicarbonate is not included.
   For example, the first colon cleansing solution may comprise sodium chloride at a concentration of
   0.5 to 5.0 g per litre. For example, sodium chloride may be present at a concentration of 1.0 to 4.0 g
 0 per litre, for example 1.0 to 3.0 g per litre, for example 1.5 to 3.Og per litre, for example 2.0 to 3.Og
   per litre; for example 3.0 to 5.0 g per litre, for example 3.5 to 4.5g per litre, for example 4.0 g per

   (iii)     0.5 to 5.0 g per litre sodium chloride, and 0.05 to 5.0 g per litre potassium chloride;
   (iv)      optionally one or more flavouring agents; and
   (v)       optionally one or more sweeteners.
   In an embodiment, the first colon cleansing solution may be a solution as commercialised under the
 5 tradename MOVIPREP@.
   The first colon cleansing solution preferably includes a flavouring agent. The first colon cleansing
   solution preferably includes a sweetener. Flavouring agents and sweeteners may be as described
   hereinabove.
   For example, a flavouring for use in in the first colon cleansing solution should preferably mask
 0 saltiness, be relatively sweet but not excessively so, and be stable in the composition. A flavouring
   makes the solutions more palatable and thus aids patient compliance. Preferred flavourings include
   lemon e.g. Ungerer Lemon (available from Ungerer Limited, Sealand Road, Chester, England CHI
   4LP) strawberry e.g. Ungerer Strawberry, grapefruit e.g. Ungerer Grapefruit flavouring powder,
   blackcurrant e.g. Ungerer Blackcurrant, pineapple e.g. IFF (International Flavours and Fragrances)
 5 Pineapple flavouring powder, orange eg Firmenich Orange, and vanilla/lemon and lime e.g. IFF
   Vanilla and Givaudin Roure Lemon and Lime Flav-o-lok, fruit punch eg Ungerer fruit punch, citrus
   punch, mango, and berry. Those and further suitable flavourings are available from International
   Flavours and Fragrances Inc. (Duddery Hill, Haverhill, Suffolk, CB9 8LG, England), Ungerer &
   Company (Sealand Road, Chester, England CHI 4LP) or Firmenich (Firmenich UK Ltd., Hayes
 0 Road, Southall, Middlesex UB2 5NN). More preferred flavourings are lemon, kiwi, strawberry
   grapefruit, fruit punch and mango. Fruit punch and mango are especially preferred flavours.
   A particularly preferred flavouring is fruit punch flavour, for example at a level of 0.4 to 3.5g per
   litre, for example 0.4 to 1.2g per litre, for example 0.938, 1.0 or 3.18g per litre.
   The first cleansing solution preferably includes a sweetener. Preferred sweeteners include aspartame,
25 acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K), sucralose and saccharine, and/ or combinations thereof. For
   example, the solution may comprise one or both of aspartame and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame
   K). For example, it may comprise one or both of sucralose and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K).
   In a preferred embodiment, the solution comprises aspartame or sucralose, for example sucralose.
   Preferred sweeteners include aspartame, acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K), sucralose and
30 saccharine, and/ or combinations thereof. For example, compositions of the invention may comprise
   one or both of aspartame and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). For example, compositions of
   the invention may comprise one or both of sucralose and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). In a
   preferred embodiment, the solution comprises aspartame or sucralose, for example aspartame.
                                                         49

   Alternatively, compositions of the invention can be essentially free from added sweeteners, for
   example to minimize the number of different components in the compositions.
   A souring agent (for example citric acid) may be present as a taste enhancer. A souring agent is a
   component that imparts a sourness to a composition. Other souring agents include malic acid, acetic
 5 acid, tartaric acid, gluconodeltalactone, phosphoric acid, succinic acid, phytic acid, lactic acid or salts
   thereof. It may be present at a level of from 0.1 to 3.0 g per litre, for example 0.3 to 2.0 g per litre,
   for example 0.5 to 2.Og per litre, for example 0.75g, 1.0g, 1.06g, 1.25g or 1.5g per litre. The souring
   agent (for example citric acid) may be provided in an encapsulated form. The encapsulation provides
   a coating that isolates the souring agent from other components and from air and moisture prior to its
 0 use. Several encapsulated forms of citric acid, or other souring agents, are commercially available.
   For example, the encapsulation may be with a water-soluble coating.
   The amount of sweetener required depends on the nature and strength of the sweetener being
   considered. Typically, it is 0.10 to 4 g per litre. For example, the sweetener may be sucralose at 0.1
   to 3.Og per litre, for example 0.3 to 2.0 g per litre, for example 0.5 to 2.Og per litre, for example 0.5 to
 5 1.3g per litre for example 0.63g, 0.80g, 1.Og or 1.58g per litre.
   The first cleansing solution may include one or more further optional components. Such components
   may be as set out above in section 3b).
   In an embodiment, the first colon cleansing solution has a volume of from 400 to 600ml (for example
   500ml), and contains the quantities of solutes described in the section immediately above. For
 0 example the volume may be 16 or 17 US fluid ounces. For example, the invention provides colon
   cleansing solution comprising :
   (i)       175 to 220 g per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 2500 to 4500 Da.
   (ii)      15 to 20 g per litre of one or more alkali metal sulphates, alkaline earth metal sulphates or a
   mixture thereof
25 (iii)    3.0 to 5.0 g per litre sodium chloride, and 1.5 to 2.5 g per litre potassium chloride;
   (iv)     optionally one or more flavouring agents; and
   (v)      optionally one or more sweeteners.
   Such a solution has a smaller volume than cleansing solutions that are generally used.
   In an embodiment, the first colon cleansing solution is provided in a volume of from 300ml up to
30 1200ml. For example, the first solution may have a volume in a range with a lower limit of 300ml,
   400ml, 500ml, 600ml or 700ml. Preferably, the lower limit is 500ml, 600ml or 700ml. The volume
   may be in a range with an upper limit of 1200ml, 11 00ml, 1000ml, 900ml or 800ml. For example the
   volume may be in the range 400ml to 11 00ml, for example 500ml to 1000ml, for example 600ml to
                                                         50

   900ml, for example 700ml to 800ml. For example, the first colon cleansing solution is provided in a
   volume of 750ml. For example the volume may be in the range 400ml to 600ml. For example, the
   first colon cleansing solution is provided in a volume of 500ml. For example it may be in a volume of
   16 or 17 US fluid ounces. The most appropriate volume will depend on the exact components of the
 5 solution and the amounts in which they are present. In general, for a solution of higher osmotic
   strength, a smaller volume will be required.
   The first cleansing solution may, for example, have a measured osmolality in the range 200 to 2000
   mOsmol/kg, 200 to 1500 mOsmol/kg. In a preferred embodiment, it is hyper-osmotic. It may, for
   example have a measured osmolality in the range 320 to 1500 mOsmol. For example, the measured
 0 osmolality of the first cleansing solution is in the range 330 to 1200 mOsmol/kg, for example 340 to
   1000 mOsmol/kg, for example 350 to 800 mOsmol/kg, for example 350 to 700 mOsmol/kg. For
   example, the solutes in the solution may have a V(350) value of from 800 to 1600ml, for example
   from 1000 to 1400ml, for example from 1150 to 1250ml, and be in a volume of 400 to 600ml, for
   example 500ml.
 5 The invention further provides a composition optionally presented in two or more parts for the
   preparation of a first colon cleansing solution. For example the composition may comprise:
   (i)       87.5 to 110 g PEG having an average molecular weight of 2500 to 4500 Da.
   (ii)      7.5 to 10 g of one or more alkali metal sulphates, alkaline earth metal sulphates or a mixture
   thereof
 0 (iii)     1.5 to 2.5g sodium chloride and 0.75 to 1.25g potassium chloride;
   (iv)      optionally one or more flavouring agents; and
   (v)       optionally one or more sweeteners.
   For example the composition may comprise:
    (i)      100 g PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da.
25 (ii)      9.0 g sodium sulphate
   (iii)     2.Og sodium chloride and 1.Og potassium chloride;
   (iv)      optionally one or more flavouring agents; and
   (v)       optionally one or more sweeteners.
   For example, the flavouring and sweetener may be 0.469g fruit punch flavouring, 0.476g sucralose
30 and 0.792g citric acid. For example, the flavouring and sweetener may be 0.500g fruit punch
   flavouring, 0.40g sucralose and 0.75g citric acid. For example, the flavouring and sweetener may be
   1.43g mango flavouring, 0.79g sucralose and 1.74g citric acid. For example, the flavouring and
                                                         51

   sweetener may be 1.59g fruit punch flavouring, 0.79g sucralose and 1.74g citric acid. Citric acid may
   optionally be packaged separately from the other components.
   Particular first solutions SI and S2, and particular second solutions TI and T2 are described in the
 5 examples section below. In a preferred aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of
   cleansing the colon of a subject comprising (or consisting essentially of):
   administering to the subject a cleansing solution of S2 as set forth herein;
   administering to the subject a cleansing solution of Ti as set forth herein.
   In preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention, the cleansing solution of S2 is administered
 0 to the subject before the cleansing solution of Ti is administered. It is particularly preferred that S2 is
   administered to the subject and then, following a time interval (such as disclosed herein), Ti is
   administered to the subject. In further preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention,
   additional fluid (such as clear fluid) is administered to the subject in conjunction with S2 and/or Ti.
   For example, additional clear fluid (such as 500ml or thereabout, or 1000ml or thereabout) is
 5 administered to the subject following administration of S2 and/or Ti. Alternatively, additional clear
   fluid is administered to the subject during administration of S2 and/or Ti. In typical embodiments,
   the cleansing solution of S2 and/or TI is self-administered.
   7. Use of sweetener in colon cleansing solution
 0 It has been found by the current inventors that a sulphate-containing colon cleansing solution that
   contains a souring agent (for example citric acid) and sucralose is particularly palatable.
   The invention further provides, according to a fourth aspect, a colon cleansing solution comprising:
   (i)      70 to 250 g per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 2500 to 4500 Da;
   (ii)     2.0 to 20 g per litre of one or more alkali metal sulphates, alkaline earth metal sulphates or a
25 mixture thereof;
   (iii 1)  optionally 1.0 to 5.0 g per litre sodium chloride;
   (iii 2)  optionally 0.5 to 1.5 (for example 0.5 to 1.1) g per litre potassium chloride;
   (iv)     optionally one or more flavouring agents;
   (v)      sucralose; and
30 (vi)     one or more souring agents.
                                                        52

   Further, the invention provides a method for improving the palatability of a sulphate-containing colon
   cleansing solution comprising including in the solution 0.1 to 3.Og per litre sucralose and 0.1 to 4.Og
   per litre of souring agent, for example 0.1 to 3.0 g per litre of souring agent, for example citric acid.
   The invention provides a method for diminishing the poor taste of a sulphate-containing colon
 5 cleansing solution comprising including in the solution 0.1 to 3.Og per litre sucralose and 0.1 to 4.Ogof
   souring agent, for example 0.1 to 3.0 g per litre of souring agent, for example citric acid.
   It is postulated that the improved palatability is associated with a reduced perceived saltiness of the
   solutions. The invention thus provides a method for reducing the perceived saltiness of a sulphate
   containing colon cleansing solution comprising including in the solution 0.1 to 3.Og per litre sucralose
 0 and 0.1 to 4.Og per litre of souring agent, for example 0.1 to 3.0 g per litre of souring agent, for
   example citric acid. "Reduction" here is taken to mean as compared with an equivalent solution
   without the sucralose and souring agent.
   A souring agent may be selected from citric acid, malic acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid,
   gluconodeltalactone, phosphoric acid, succinic acid, phytic acid, lactic acid or salts thereof. For
 5 example, the souring agent may be citric acid. It may be present at a level of from 0.1 to 4.Og per
   litre, for example 0.1 to 3.0 g per litre, for example 0.3 to 2.0 g per litre, for example 0.5 to 2.Og per
   litre, for example 0.75g, 1.0g, 1.06g, 1.25g or 1.5g per litre. For example, it may be at a level of 3.0
   to 4.Og per litre, for example 3.48g per litre. Citric acid, or another souring agent, may be provided in
   an encapsulated form. The encapsulation provides a coating that isolates the souring agent from other
 0 components and from air and moisture prior to its use. Several encapsulated forms of citric acid, or
   other souring agents, are commercially available. For example, the encapsulation may be with a
   water-soluble coating.
   The sucralose may, for example be present at a level of 0.1 to 3.Og per litre, for example 0.3 to 2.0 g
   per litre, for example 0.5 to 2.Og per litre, for example 0.5 to 1.3g per litre for example 0.63g, 0.80g,
25 or 1.Og per litre. For example, it may be at a level of 1.58g per litre.
   When sucralose and citric acid are used, a particularly preferred flavouring is fruit punch flavour, for
   example at a level of 0.4 to 1.2g per litre, for example 0.625g per litre or 1.Og per litre.
   There is also provided a composition for the preparation of such a solution, for example by admixture
   with water. Preferred amounts of each of components (i) to (iv) in the solutions and compositions of
30 the fourth aspect of the invention are as set out for the first colon cleansing solutions and first colon
   cleansing compositions hereinabove in section 6b).
                                                         53

   A colon cleansing solution according to the fourth aspect of the invention may contain PEG, sulphate,
   sodium chloride, potassium chloride and flavouring in amounts and types as described hereinabove in
   relation to the first colon cleansing solution in section 6b).
   A colon cleansing solution according to the fourth aspect of the invention may be used together with a
 5 solution of the first or second aspect of the invention as set out in sections 2 to 5. Alternatively, it
   may be used in combination with a different other colon cleansing solution, or used in a suitable
   volume on its own. If used on its own, it may be used in a single dose or in a split dose
   administration. The invention provides a method of cleansing the colon of a subject comprising
   administering a solution of the fourth aspect of the invention. The solution may be administered on
 0 its own or in combination with a further, different, solution.

                                                       56

   In an embodiment of a kit of the invention, the flavouring component e) or the sweetener component
   f) may be provided separately from other components. The kit may provide several alternative
   flavourings, allowing the subject to decide themselves which flavouring from a range of flavourings
   to use.

   whereby component a) is packaged in a first compartment and components b), c) e) and f) are
   packaged in a second compartment.
   In a further embodiment, one or more of the components may be in a dry powder form (for example
   the ascorbate component or the PEG component may be in dry powder form), whilst some of the
 5 remaining components (for example the sodium chloride or the potassium chloride) are in the form of
   a tablet or in a semi-solid (for example gel) form. In such an embodiment, the subject may be
   instructed to dissolve the powder components in water and drink it, and instructed to take the tablet or
   semi-solid form without dissolution. If a semi-solid form (for example gel) is present, the subject
   may be instructed to add it to water before ingesting it, or the subject may be instructed to take it as
 0 provided.
   It is convenient for the patient for a kit of the invention to be provided in the form of, for example, a
   box. In a kit of the invention the first and/or second parts may each contained in one or more
   containers. Examples of suitable containers include tubs, bags and sachets. A preferred container is a
   sachet.
25 In one embodiment, the composition of the invention can be provided in a multi-chambered container,
   for example of the type disclosed in W02012/105524. A multi-chambered container may have a
   partition wall and two separate powders can be stored separated from each other. In addition, in a
   container of the type disclosed in W02012/105524, a powdered medicine, which has been stored in a
   separated state, can be simply and readily mixed at the time of use to provide an aqueous solution.
30 For example, a multi-chambered container comprises a substantially flat pouch formed from a flexible
   film, a partition wall configured as a detachable seal detachably welding opposing inner surfaces of
   the pouch, and a pour port for infusion and discharge of a liquid, that is attached to the periphery of
   the pouch so as to open into one of the plurality of partitioned chambers. For example, the partition
   wall comprises a horizontal section which extends along a gusseted bottom section of the pouch and a
                                                         57

   perpendicular section which is curved from the horizontal section to a pouch upper section. The
   partition wall may, for example, be frangible. For example, a first partitioned chamber having a large
   capacity is formed on one side of the partition wall close to the bottom section of the pouch, a second
   partitioned chamber having a small capacity is formed on the other side of the partition wall, and the
 5 pour port opens into the first partitioned chamber.

 0 b) optionally 10 to 200 g per litre polyethylene glycol;
   the solution being essentially free from ascorbic acid.
   The solutions and methods of the fifth aspect of the invention may have the features described above
   in relation to the solutions and methods of the third aspect of the invention as set out in section 6
 5 above.
   b) alternative:
   The invention also provides a method of cleansing the colon of a subject comprising:
             - administering to the subject an effective amount of a first cleansing solution; and then after a
             time interval
20           - administering to the subject an effective amount of a second cleansing solution,
   wherein the first cleansing solution is hyper-osmotic and contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of
   ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof (for example ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate, for example
   sodium ascorbate); and wherein the second cleansing solution is either substantially free from
   ascorbic acid and salts thereof, or contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a
25 mixture thereof, in an amount providing a lower concentration of ascorbate anion than is present in
   the first cleansing solution. The first cleansing solution may comprise PEG and electrolytes (for
   example sodium chloride and potassium chloride). The second solution may comprise PEG; it may
   comprise an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphate (for example sodium sulphate); it may
   comprise electrolytes (for example sodium chloride and potassium chloride). There are also provided
30 kits comprising a first and a second solution according to the invention, and kits comprising
   compositions for preparing the first and second solutions.
                                                         67

   The first cleansing solution contains a higher concentration of ascorbate anion than is present in the
   second cleansing solution. For example, the first cleansing solution contains twice the concentration
   of the ascorbate anion than the second cleansing solution or more. For example, the first solution
   contains three times or more, four times or more, or five times or more the concentration of the
 5 ascorbate anion than the second cleansing solution. For example, the first cleansing solution contains
   a concentration of the ascorbate anion that is at least 50mmol per litre greater than that of the second
   cleansing solution. That is to say that the first solution contains a concentration of ascorbate anion
   that is at least 50mmol per litre greater than that of the second solution. For example, the first
   solution contains a concentration of the ascorbate anion that is greater by at least 100mmol per litre,
 0 for example at least 200mmol per litre, at least 300mmol per litre.
   For example, the second cleansing solution may be substantially free from an ascorbate component.
   For example, the first cleansing solution may comprise:
   - 56.6g sodium ascorbate, or
   - 33.9g sodium ascorbate and 20.1g ascorbic acid, or
 5 - 33.9g sodium ascorbate, or
   - 33.9g sodium ascorbate and 21.4 g magnesium ascorbate.
   The first cleansing solution may further comprise polyethylene glycol. The polyethylene glycol
   (PEG) may, for example, have an average molecular weight of 2500 to 4500 Da, for example 3000 to
   4000 Da. For example, the PEG may be PEG 3350 or PEG 4000 as defined in national
 0 pharmacopeias. Further examples of suitable PEGs recognized in some national pharmacopeias
   include Macrogols, for example Macrogol 4000.
   For example, the first cleansing solution may comprise 20g or 40g PEG 3350. For example, the first
   cleansing solution may have a volume of 500ml. For example it may have a volume of 16 or 17 US
   fluid ounces.
25 The second cleansing solution may comprise polyethylene glycol and/or an alkali metal sulphate, an
   alkaline earth metal sulphate, or a mixture thereof.
   The polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the second cleansing solution may be as described immediately
   above for the first cleansing solution. The PEG in the second cleansing solution can be a different
   PEG from the PEG in the second cleansing solution. For example, one PEG may be PEG3350 and
30 the other PEG may be PEG4000. For example, the second cleansing solution may comprise 1Og
   PEG 3350.       For example, the second cleansing solution may have a volume of 750ml. For example
   it may have a volume of 25 or 26 US fluid ounces.
                                                        68

   The second cleansing solution preferably comprises an alkali metal sulphate, an alkaline earth metal
   sulphate or a mixture thereof An alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphate may, for example, be
   selected from sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate and magnesium sulphate. The solution may
   comprise more than one of sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate and magnesium sulphate, for
 5 example all three. Preferably, the alkali metal sulphate, an alkaline earth metal sulphate or the
   mixture thereof is or includes sodium sulphate. Preferably, an alkali metal sulphate or alkaline earth
   metal sulphate (for example sodium sulphate) is anhydrous.
   For example, the second cleansing solution may have a volume of 750ml and comprise 3g, 6g or 9g of
   sodium sulphate.
 0 The first and/or second cleansing solution(s) may further comprise one or more of:
   a) one or more electrolytes;
   b) one or more flavouring agents;
   c) one or more sweeteners.
   Electrolytes include salts of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, particularly sodium and
 5 potassium; and salts of chloride, iodide, bicarbonate and carbonate, particularly chloride. Preferred
   electrolytes are sodium chloride and potassium chloride. In an embodiment, the first and/or second
   solution is substantially free from sodium bicarbonate.
   For example, the second cleansing solution may have a volume of 750ml and comprise 1.4g sodium
   chloride and 0.3g potassium chloride; or 1.6g sodium chloride and 0.7g potassium chloride; or 2.Og
 O sodium chloride and 1.Og potassium chloride.
   For example, the first cleansing solution may have a volume of 500ml and comprise 3.5g sodium
   chloride and 2.2g potassium chloride; or 2.7g sodium chloride and 1.3g potassium chloride; or 2.8g
   sodium chloride and 1.3g potassium chloride; or 2.8g sodium chloride and 2.0g potassium chloride; or
   3.1g sodium chloride and 1.3g potassium chloride. For example the first cleansing solution is
25 substantially free from sodium bicarbonate.
   The first and/or second cleansing solution(s) preferably include a flavouring agent. Flavouring for use
   in compositions of the invention should preferably mask saltiness, be relatively sweet but not
   excessively so, and be stable in the composition. Flavouring makes the solutions more palatable and
   thus aids patient compliance. Preferred flavourings include lemon e.g. Ungerer Lemon (available
30 from Ungerer Limited, Sealand Road, Chester, England CHI 4LP) strawberry e.g. Ungerer
   Strawberry, grapefruit e.g. Ungerer Grapefruit flavouring powder, blackcurrant e.g. Ungerer
   Blackcurrant, pineapple e.g. IFF (International Flavours and Fragrances) Pineapple flavouring
   powder, orange eg Firmenich Orange, vanilla/lemon and lime e.g. IFF Vanilla and Givaudin Roure
                                                      69

  Lemon and Lime Flav-o-lok, fruit punch eg Ungerer fruit punch, citrus punch, mango, and berry.
  Those and further suitable flavourings are available from International Flavours and Fragrances Inc.
  (Duddery Hill, Haverhill, Suffolk, CB9 8LG, England), Ungerer & Company (Sealand Road, Chester,
  England CHI 4LP) or Firmenich (Firmenich UK Ltd., Hayes Road, Southall, Middlesex UB2 5NN).
5 More preferred flavourings are lemon, kiwi, strawberry, grapefruit, orange, fruit punch and mango.
  Fruit punch and mango are especially preferred flavourings for the first solution. The most preferred
  flavourings for the second solution are lemon flavour and orange flavour.
  The first and/or second cleansing solution(s) preferably include a sweetener. Sugar-based sweeteners
  are generally not suited for colon cleansing compositions because the delivery of unabsorbed sugars
0 to the colon provides a substrate for bacteria. Such sugars may be metabolised by the bacteria to form
  explosive gases such as hydrogen and methane. The presence of explosive gases in the colon can be
  highly dangerous when electrical apparatus is to be used during colonoscopy or other procedures.
  Preferred sweeteners include aspartame, acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K), sucralose and
  saccharine, and/ or combinations thereof. For example, compositions of the invention may comprise
5 one or both of aspartame and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). For example, compositions of
  the invention may comprise one or both of sucralose and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K).
  Alternatively, compositions of the invention can be substantially free from added sweeteners, for
  example to minimize the number of different components in the compositions. Citric acid may also
  be present as a taste enhancer.

   Examples
   General description of sample evaluation protocol
   The same sample evaluation protocol was used for the taste tests of all of the solutions described
   below that were taste tested. The protocol was as follows:
 5 1. The solution was sipped from 1oz cups, swished in the mouth, and expectorated.
   2. Initial flavour was immediately evaluated (t=O).
   3. The aftertaste was evaluated at periodic time intervals: 1, 3 and 5 minutes.
   4. Upon completing the evaluation, the panellists cleansed their palates using spring water and
   unsalted crackers.
 0 The Panelists were asked to provide a score of their perception of the intensity of the saltiness of the
   solutions, using the scale:
   Intensity Scale:        0 = None
                           1 = Slight
                           2 = Moderate
 5                         3 = Strong
   In general the panel consisted of from 2 to 8 tasters. The average saltiness intensity score was plotted
   against time.
   Example 1: Sodium ascorbate/Ascorbic acid solutions
 O In an initial set of solutions containing PEG3350 (40g), sodium chloride (2.8g), potassium chloride
   (1.3g) and sodium ascorbate (56.6g), it was found that the sweeteners sucralose and aspartame were
   most effective in reducing the perceived saltiness of the solution. Acesulfame-K and sodium
   saccharin were less effective.
   The solutions in Tables 1 and 2 were prepared and taste tested. The results of the taste testing are
25 shown in Figures 1 and 2.

   In Figures 1 and 2, it is seen that the saltiness intensity is reduced most in the solution containing
 5 sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid in the ratio 85:15, ie solutions F5 and G5.
   Example 2: Sodium ascorbate solutions and taste testing

   Example 4a - V(350) Osmolality measurements:
   In order to assess the osmotic strength of the solutions, it was determined how much water was
   required to provide a solution with measured osmolality of 350mOsmol/kg from the amounts of the
   components in Tables 5 and 6.
 5 To each solution prepared by dissolving the components in Tables 5 and 6 above in 500ml of
   deionised water was added further deionised water until it reached an osmolality of 350mOsmol/kg.
   The total volumes (including the initial 500ml) required to reach an osmolality of 350 mOsmol/kg are
   recorded in Tables 5 and 6 in the final columns. Osmolalities were measured using an Advanced
   Instruments, Inc Model 3250 osmometer. The osmometer was operated following standard
 0 instructions: after the device passes a calibration check, the "Low Range" osmolality range (0 to 2000
   mOsmol/kg) is selected, and a sample tube containing 250ptl of sample solution is placed in the
   freezing chamber. The "start" button is then pressed. When the measurement is completed, the
   device displays the measurement result and that is recorded.
   Example 4b - Bowel Cleansing
 5 In a bowel cleansing study, subjects are given solutions Si or S2 in an evening followed by Ti or T2
   the following morning. In a variant, subjects are given solution Ti or T2 in an evening followed by
   SI or S2 the following morning.
   Each subject receives the solution regimen in the split dose intake:
   - Evening dose: Day 1; start intake between 17:00 and 18:00 for an intake period of up to 2 hours after
 0 fasting from 14:00 hours.
   - Morning dose: Day 2; start intake between 07:00 and 08:00 for an intake period of 2 hours.
   Following each dose additional clear liquid will be consumed to make the total dose and additional
   clear fluid ingested equal to at least 3L in the case of Arms I to 6, 8 and 9, and at least 2L in the case
   of Arm 7.
25
   Each dose of cleansing solution is reconstituted with water from the appropriate pair of sachets
   containing powder for oral solution. The cleansing solution can be cooled in the fidge based on
   subject preference. Evening cleansing solution dose is drunk within 2 hours after the start of the
   intake on the evening of Day 1. At least the indicated additional clear fluid is also consumed,
30 preferably within I hour after the end of intake of cleansing solution in the evening.
   In the morning of Day 2, the second dose is drunk within 2 hours after the start of intake. At least the
   indicated additional clear fluid is also consumed, preferably within I hour after the end of intake of
   cleansing solution in the morning. The total duration of each intake of cleansing solution and clear
35 fluid intake should normally not exceed 3 hours. Each subject is instructed to drink the assigned
                                                        74

   cleansing solutions as 100 mL fractions every 10 minutes. The mandatory additional clear liquid
   intake (water) after the cleansing solution intake can be taken by the subject as prefers, usually within
   1 hour after completion of each cleansing solution intake. The start time and finish time of intake is
   recorded. The volume of any cleansing solution or additional clear fluid left in the respective
 5 containers is measured. In arms 6 to 9 the volume of fluid consumed ad libitum is monitored and
   recorded.

10 Stool output is measured from the start of the intake on the evening of Day I and over the following
   24 hours. "Stool" is the term used to refer to all bowel effluent. Mostly, it is liquid. The following
   are also assessed
   - Tolerability (vomiting rate).
                                                        75

   - Time and volume of cleansing solution to reach a clear effluent.
   In certain subjects, the following are also assessed:
   - Colon cleansing success.
 5 - The segmental cleansing scores for each of the five colon segments.
   - Pharmacokinetic evaluation of key active ingredients: Ascorbate components and their metabolite
   (oxalic acid) in blood, urine and faeces and PEG3350 and electrolytes in faeces at defined time points,
   to demonstrate biological activities. Electrolytes in blood and urine are quantified using standard
   clinical chemistry methods.
 0 The study described above was carried out in two parts: Parts A and B.
   Part A: In the part A, 120 subjects (70 male, 50 female) were allocated to the four study Arms, Arms
   1 to 4. They were given the solutions as set out in Table 7. At the time of filing, the full statistical
   analysis of the results is not complete. The interim results based on a preliminary analysis of the data
   and available at the time of filing are shown in Table 9.

   Overall, the compliance level was good. However, in each of Arms 2 and 4, 30 subjects began the
   study, but one subject left the study after consuming the first solution, and before any stool sample
   could be collected (thus 29 subjects are indicated (*)). The stool weight data are based on the set of
20 30 subjects for Arms 1 and 3, and on the set of 29 subjects for Arms 2 and 4. Both of those subjects
   who left the study had the symptom of vomiting. They are included in the vomiting rate results.
   It is seen that in each of Arms 1, 2 and 3 the subjects achieved a higher mean stool output weight than
   in Arm 4, which represents a prior art colon cleansing solution. This was achieved with the subjects
   in each of Arms 1, 2 and 3 consuming a lower total volume of bowel cleansing solution
                                                       76

   (investigational medicinal product "IMP") than in Arm 4. The vomiting rate for Arm 2 was higher
   than for the other arms. The vomiting rate for each of the solutions was within expected limits for a
   bowel cleansing solution.
 5 Part B: In part B, 120 subjects (54 male, 66 female) were allocated to the four study Arms, Arms 6 to
   9. They were given the solutions as set out in Table 8. Mean stool output was highest in Arm 7 and
   slightly lower in Arm 6. Arm 8 gave a lower mean stool output, but all of Arms 6, 7 and 8 gave a
   higher mean stool output than Arm 9, which represents a prior art colon cleansing solution. Mean
   stool output exceeded 2400g in all arms. Mean stool output in Arms 6 and 7 exceeded 3000g.
 0 The subjects in part B underwent colonoscopy and the quality of cleansing was graded by the
   colonoscopist, who was not aware of which cleansing treatment had been administered. Grading used
   the Harefield Cleansing Scale. For details of the Harefield Cleansing Scale, see Halphen et al.,
   GastrointestinalEndoscopy, 2013, 78, 121-131. The Harefield Cleansing Scale grades colon
   cleansing as Grade A, B, C or D, A being the best. Grades A and B are considered a successful
 5 cleansing; Grades C and D are considered an unsuccessful cleansing. At the time of filing, the full
   statistical analysis of the results is not complete. The interim results based on a preliminary analysis
   of the data and available at the time of filing are shown in Table 10.

   total volume of bowel cleansing solution (investigational medicinal product "IMP") than in Arm 9.
