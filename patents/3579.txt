Technical Field
[0001]     The invention relates to medical procedures, and more particularly to apparatuses and
methods of using a resection line guide in various medical procedures.
Background
[0002]     Obesity, as a disease, affects a significant portion of the world's population. Obesity often
leads to multiple chronic medical conditions and premature death from cardiovascular events and
cancer. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC") reports that over 33% of the
U.S. population is obese, with a body mass index ("BMI") of over 30, and another 35-40% of the
population is overweight, with a BMI of 25-30. The CDC reports that the percent of the population
being either overweight or obese by 2018 will be 75%. The CDC also reports that obesity directly
costs the U.S. economy $147 billion currently, and projects that the costs will approach $315 billion
by 2020. The increase in obesity and the financial impact on the local economy is not limited to the
United States but impacts many countries throughout the world.
[0003]     Obesity has environmental, genetic, and behavioral origins but is intractable to most medical
and behavioral interventions. Weight loss, or bariatric, surgery seems to be the only effective long
term treatment option for patients with a BMI greater than 35. Despite the 20 million patients who are
eligible for weight loss surgery in the United States, the number of procedures per year has plateaued
at about 200,000, essentially eliminating any meaningful public health effect of the surgery.
[0004]     In recent years, laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy has emerged as a procedure that is
safe and effective for patients who are eligible for weight loss surgery. Since its introduction in 2003
as a stand-alone surgery, vertical sleeve gastrectomy has been studied extensively. It is now widely
accepted as the surgery that should be offered to most morbidly obese patients over laparoscopic
adjustable gastric banding and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The surgery has been adopted
by most bariatric surgeons and is now one of the most commonly used procedures to achieve effective
weight loss.
[0005]     During a vertical sleeve gastrectomy, approximately 80% of the stomach is removed and the
remaining pouch is based on the less distensible lesser curve of the stomach. The fundus of the
stomach, which is formed by the upper curvature of the organ, is the most crucial portion of the
stomach that is removed. The resultant gastric pouch generally should be about 80 mL to about 820
mL in volume, should not be narrowed at the incisura angularis, should be as straight as possible to
avoid obstruction from spiraling or zigzagging, should be about 0.5 cm to about 2 cm away from the
gastroesophageal junction, and should be about 2 cm to about 10 cm away from the pylorus.
                                                      1

 WO 2015/095333                                                                    PCT/US2014/070869
[0006]     A vertical sleeve gastrectomy is typically performed using standard laparoscopic equipment.
The greater curvature of the stomach is mobilized by using vessel-sealing devices to seal the gastric
branches of the gastroepiploic vessels and the short gastric vessels. The posterior adhesions of the
stomach are also divided so the stomach is fully mobilized while the blood supply to the lesser
curvature remains intact. The left crus of the diaphragm is an important landmark to ensure the
fundus has been fully mobilized.
[0007]     Following mobilization of the stomach and repair of any hiatal hernia that may be present, a
calibration tube or bougie is typically introduced into the stomach through the mouth. The bougie is
inserted through the mouth, down the esophagus, and into the stomach, where it is used as a point of
reference in order to help align the initial staple fire. The bougie acts as a left-hand landmark, which
the surgeon uses to visualize the path of the staple line. A surgeon creating a sleeve gastrectomy
staple line will estimate 2.0 cm away from the lesser curvature of the stomach and visually orient the
stapler. As constant diameter bougies cannot be used to facilitate orienting the stapler, only surgeon
experience and estimation is used. At the top of the staple line, it is important to not divide part of the
esophagus or the 'sling fibers' of the cardia, which participate in the physiologic anti-mflux action of
the lower esophageal sphincter. Surgeons must use visual cues to ensure that the staple line is a safe
distance away from the gastroesophageal junction.
[0008]     Resection is accomplished by a series of applications of a laparoscopic linear surgical
stapler. The staplers that are most commonly used for sleeve gastrectomy are 60 mm in length and
include an integrated cutting blade. Each staple application places three rows of overlapping staples
into the tissue on either side of the cutting blade. For sleeve gastrectomy, the average number of
staple fires per procedure is 4 to 6 in order to create a continuous resection line. This results in a
resection line that is approximately 15 cm to about 36 cm on average. Currently, surgeon training,
experience, and trial and error are the only tools used to aid the surgeon in determining the path of the
resection line in a vertical sleeve gastrectomy. Only after applying the stapler to begin creating the
resection line is the resultant stomach anatomy demonstrated. Before beginning stapling, the surgeon
must attempt to envision the resultant anatomy of the stomach. Further, the surgeon must actively and
accurately control the stapler during the resection to produce the desired resection line. Because the
thickness of the stomach tissue varies at the antrum, the body and the fundus, different staple leg
lengths are typically used. This requires the stapler to be removed from the patient between firings to
load the stapler with a new staple cartridge having staples with an appropriate leg length.
[0009]     There is wide variability in the size and type of calibration tube, or bougie, used by surgeons
to size the remaining gastric sleeve.       Some surgeons use an endoscope (30 French or 1 cm in
diameter) while others use a large mercury-weighted bougie (60 French or 2 cm in diameter). In a
                                                      2

 WO 2015/095333                                                                  PCT/US2014/070869
large meta-analysis, there was no difference in weight loss when bougie sizes of less than 40 and
greater than 40 were used. The resection line is important in sleeve gastrectomy because the amount
of weight loss and subsequent medical complications may be a direct result of the quality of the
resultant anatomy. The resultant anatomy is determined by the resection line created by the surgeon
during the gastrectomy.     Negative consequences related to the quality of the resection line may
include, for example, gastroesophageal reflux, weight loss failure, weight regain, food intolerance,
resection line bleed, and leak.
[0010]     Leaks are the most concerning complication of a vertical sleeve gastrectomy.        In large
pooled databases, the leak rate is approximately 0.3 to 2%.        Leak is thought to be prevented by
making a straight resection line that avoids crossing staple cartridge applications, has no narrow
segments (particularly at the incisura angularis), is about 1 cm from the gastroesophageal junction,
and has a squared-off final application. Generally speaking, leak is not prevented by over-sewing the
resection line or using buttress material in the resection line. Leak is thought to be more a result of
poor resultant stomach anatomy. Poor anatomy is a direct result of the shortcomings of the calibration
equipment and technique used to create the resection line. Conventional calibration tubes specifically
designed for use in a sleeve gastrectomy may provide some user benefits, but fail to reliably produce
the proper geometry of the resultant anatomy from the vertical sleeve gastrectomy.
[0011]     Accordingly, new apparatuses and methods are needed to address the shortcomings of
existing apparatuses and methods. More particularly, new apparatuses and methods are needed that
improve the consistency and quality of the resection line created during a medical procedure, such as a
vertical sleeve gastrectomy.

Detailed Description
[00117] In its broadest aspects, embodiments of the present invention are directed to a resection line
guide for directing the application of a resection line during a surgical procedure involving the
resection of at least a part of an anatomical structure. In an exemplary embodiment, the resection line
guide may be used in a vertical sleeve gastrectomy procedure.             The resection line guide is a
supplement to current practices of a sleeve gastrectomy, including the laparoscopic access,
mobilization of the greater curvature of the stomach and multiple applications of a laparoscopic
stapler to create the resection line. Laparoscopic surgery is surgery inside of the abdominal cavity
performed at a distance by the surgeon.        Laparoscopic surgery instrumentation is designed to fit
through small incisions in the abdominal wall, typically 5 mm to 15 mm in diameter. The abdominal
access sites are maintained by cannulae, or trocars, that are designed to maintain pressure in the
abdominal cavity with valves that seal around an instrument shaft.             Devices and methods for
performing laparoscopic surgery are well known in the prior art.
[00118]    While embodiments discussed below involve the use of the resection line guide to guide and
support a medical instrument during a medical procedure, it should be recognized that the resection
line guide may act as a surgical clamp independent of its use as a guide to a medical instrument.
Further, while embodiments discussed below involve the use of the resection line guide in a vertical
sleeve gastrectomy procedure, the resection line guide may also be used in other procedures involving
anatomical structures, such as organs other than the stomach or soft tissue. For example, the resection
line guide may be used in a parencymal resection, lung volume reduction surgery, or other procedures
involving the lung. Further, the resection line guide may be useful in an anatomic resection such as a
lobectomy, a non-anatomic parencymal resection, or other procedures involving the liver. Moreover,
a surgeon or other medical professional may benefit from using the resection line guide in a partial
nephrectomy, total nephrectomy, or other procedures involving the kidney.             During procedures
involving an anatomical structure, the tissue of the anatomical structure may be sealed. Tissue may be
sealed by any method known in the art, such as, for example, stapling, suturing, gluing, and welding.
Thus, while aspects of the present invention may be illustrated in the context of a vertical sleeve
gastrectomy, it should be appreciated that aspects of the invention may provide a benefit in a host of
medical procedures on anatomical structures and be adapted for use in such medical procedures.
[00119]    Now referring to the figures, Fig. 1 illustrates the anatomy of the stomach 10 and a resection
line 12, where the resection line 12 represents a resection line for a vertical sleeve gastrectomy. The
                                                      13

 WO 2015/095333                                                                  PCT/US2014/070869
stomach 10 generally includes a proximal end 14, a distal end 16, an anterior side 18, and a posterior
side 20. As used herein, the proximal and distal ends 14, 16 of the stomach are described from the
perspective of the operative surgeon. The gastroesophageal junction 22 opens into the stomach 10
and is a common landmark in bariatric surgeries.        The fundus 24 and the section of the stomach
defined by the greater curvature 26 are generally the parts of the stomach 10 removed during a vertical
sleeve gastrectomy.    The remaining pouch is generally defined by the lesser curvature 28 and the
resection line 12 and presents a stomach with a significantly reduced volume. As described above, the
desired location of the resection line 12 is about 0.5 to 2 cm away from the gastroesophageal junction
22 and about 2 to 10 cm away from the pylorus 30. In accordance with aspects of the invention,
resection line guides as described herein aid in forming high quality, consistent resection lines during
a medical procedure, such as a vertical sleeve gastrectomy. In this regard, the resection line guides
provide an accurate visual indication of the resection line and further provide a stabilizing engagement
surface along which medical staplers may be guided during a resection procedure. The visualization
and guiding aspects of the disclosed resection line guides are believed to result in high quality and
consistent resection lines that are significantly improved over resection lines produced by current
methodologies.
[00120]    Various embodiments of the present invention may include a resection line guide including
two clamp members capable of being operatively coupled to each other and movable relative to each
other so as to provide a clamping force on an anatomical structure, such as a stomach. The ability of
the resection line guides to generate a clamping force allows the device to be reliably positioned
relative to the anatomical structure in order to eliminate or reduce the likelihood of undesirable
movements of the device during a stapling operation. In this regard, Fig. 2A illustrates an exemplary
embodiment where a resection line guide 40 includes a first clamp member 42 generally positionable
on the anterior side 18 of the stomach 10, and a second clamp member 44 generally positionable on
the posterior side 20 of the stomach 10, where the first clamp member 42 and the second clamp
member 44 may be configured to be operatively coupled to effectuate a clamping force on the
stomach 10. In other words, once the clamp members are coupled, the first clamp member 42 and the
second clamp member 44 essentially operate as a surgical clamping device for purposes described in
more detail below. It should be realized that aspects of the present invention are not limited to the
illustrated arrangement, where the first clamp member 42 is on the anterior side 18 of the stomach 10
and the second clamp member 44 is on the posterior side 20. In an alternative embodiment, for
example, the arrangement may be reversed such that the first clamp member 42 is on the posterior
side 20 of the stomach 10 and the second clamp member 44 is on the anterior side 18 of the stomach
10 (not shown). Other alternative arrangements may also be possible.
                                                    14

 WO 2015/095333                                                                PCT/US2014/070869
[00121] As noted above, the first and second clamp members 42, 44 may be configured to be
operatively coupled to each other to effectuate a clamping force on an anatomical structure. In one
embodiment, as illustrated in Fig. 2B, the clamp members 42, 44 couple together at both the proximal
end 14 and distal end 16 of the stomach 10. The clamp members 42, 44 may be coupled together
using a variety of methods and engagement elements, such as that described below. By way of
example, the proximal and distal ends of one the clamp members may include a projection or pin that
can be engaged or received by the proximal and distal ends of the other clamp member, respectively.
Alternatively, the clamp members may be configured to connect using magnets, a clip-in connection,
or other types of connections or connectors that are generally well known in the art. The connection
method used at the proximal and distal ends of the clamp members do not need to be similar. By way
of example, the distal ends of the clamp members may be configured to connect using a clip-in
connection, while the proximal end of one of the clamp members may be configured to slide through
an opening on the proximal end of the other clamp member, where the opening is capable of receiving
and gripping the proximal end of the one clamp member. Accordingly, there are many ways to
couple the clamp members and the invention should not be limited to a certain type of connection.
[00122] In this regard, Fig. 2B illustrates the resection line guide 40 placed around the stomach 10
with the clamp members 42, 44 coupled together at both the proximal and distal ends 14, 16 of the
stomach 10. Using laparoscopic instruments, the second clamp member 44 may be inserted under
(posterior to) the stomach 10 so that the distal end 44a of the second clamp member 44 generally
extends beyond the distal end 16 of the stomach 10 and the proximal end 44b generally extends
beyond the proximal end 14 of the stomach. Next, the first clamp member 42 may be inserted over
(anterior to) the stomach 10 using laparoscopic instruments, for example, so that the distal end 42a of
the first clamp member 42 generally extends beyond the distal end 16 of the stomach 10 and the
proximal end 42b generally extends beyond the proximal end 14 of the stomach 10. The resection
line guide 40 may be put in place and used with or without having to mobilize the greater curvature.
For example, a surgeon may prefer to leave the greater curvature 26 attached to the omentum (not
shown), which could improve stability of the stomach 10 during stapling.
[00123] In accordance with the present embodiment, the distal end 44a of the second clamp member
44 may be received through the distal end 42a of the first clamp member 42. Similarly, the proximal
end 44b of the second clamp member 44 may be received through the proximal end 42b of the first
clamp member 42. In this regard, the distal and proximal ends 44a, 44b may include a serrated tab 46
and the distal and proximal ends 42a, 42b may include a passage or bore 48 having an opening
through which the serrated tabs 46 may pass. Collectively, the tab 46 and bore 48 operate as a flexible
ratchet capable of bringing the clamp members 42, 44 together to generate a clamping force. The
                                                   15

 WO 2015/095333                                                                     PCT/US2014/070869
bores 48 may be configured to prevent the serrated tabs 46 from moving backwards through the
openings. The clamp members 42, 44 may be further manipulated so as to provide a sufficient
clamping force on the stomach 10 to effectively prevent or minimize the guide 40 from moving, but
without damaging the clamped tissue. For example, conventional graspers may be used to pull the
tabs 46 through the bores 48. Although not shown, the resection line guide 40 may include a release
mechanism in the flexible ratchet that allows the tab 46 to be released from the bore 48 and thereby
separate the two clamp members 42, 44. It should be appreciated that the flexible ratchet may take
other forms other than that described above.
[00124]    More particularly, and in one aspect of the invention, the resection line guide 40 may be
positioned relative to the stomach 10 using a two-stage clamping process. In the first clamping stage,
the first and second clamp members 42, 44 may be configured to provide a certain amount of
resistance to movement of the resection line guide 40 relative to the stomach 10. For example, the
range of clamping force (or clamping pressure) in the first stage may be about 0.5 g/mm 2 to about 4
g/nun2.    This resistance is configured to prevent undesirable or unintentional movements of the
resection line guide 40, but yet permit the surgeon to move the resection line guide 40 to a desired
position relative to the stomach 10 without significant difficulty. In the second clamping stage, and
with the resection line guide 40 in the desired location relative to the stomach 10, the clamping force
of the resection line guide 40 may be increased to effectively prevent or minimize the guide 40 from
moving relative to the stomach 10. For example, the clamping force (or clamping pressure) in the
second stage may be about 4 g/mm2 to about 12 g/mm2 . In an exemplary embodiment, the clamping
force (or clamping pressure) in the second stage may be about 8 g/mm2. The upper limit to which the
resection line guide 40 may be clamped is selected so as to avoid any damage to the underlying tissue
being clamped. This upper limit may be, for example, about 12 g/mm2. Additionally, the value of
about 4 g/mm2 represents a threshold clamping force below which constitutes the first stage clamping
and above which constitutes the second stage clamping. It should be recognized that these values are
merely exemplary and the particular values may depend on several factors, including the anatomical
structure being clamped as well as other factors. Thus, the invention should not be limited to the
range of values provided herein.
[00125]    In an advantageous aspect of the invention, when the resection line guide 40 is placed on the
stomach 10 (e.g., in the first clamping stage as described above), the surgeon has a clear visualization
of the intended results of the vertical sleeve gastrectomy prior to actually performing the resection of
the stomach 10 at the resection line 12. Hence, the surgeon has an indication of what the resultant
stomach shape and volume defined by the lesser curvature 28 and the resection line 12 will likely be
prior to cutting tissue. If the surgeon is not satisfied with the indication of the expected stomach shape
                                                       16

 WO 2015/095333                                                                   PCT/US2014/070869
and volume, the surgeon may adjust and manipulate the location and alignment of the resection line
guide 40 prior to stapling and cutting the stomach 10. This is in contrast to current procedures, where
the resection line is generally not well visualized prior to activating the stapler, thus the ultimate
outcome is less certain. It should be appreciated that the resection line guide 40 should be positioned
such that it does not provide lateral stretching or tension of the stomach 10, which may create an
undesirable environment for stapling and cutting. Using a resection line guide, such as resection line
guide 40, ensures proper alignment of the resection line 12 so that the final cut with the stapler
removes the fundus 24 portion, is a safe distance away from both the lesser curvature 28 and the
gastroesophageal junction 22, and is squared off at the fundus 24 of the stomach to prevent or reduce
the likelihood of necrotic tissue development.
[00126]    Once the resection line guide 40 is properly positioned, the surgeon may then cut and staple
(e.g., using a stapler conventionally used in gastrectomy procedures) the tissue using the resection line
guide 40 as a track along the entire segment or a significant part of the segment until complete
resection of the stomach 10 occurs, as illustrated in Figs. 2C and 2D. In this regard, an aspect of the
stapling device (such as an outer edge thereof), schematically shown as stapling device 50, may abut
or engage the resection line guide 40 along an alignment surface 52 to facilitate an improved resection
line. For example, the outer edges of one or both of the clamp members 42, 44 may operate as an
alignment surface 52 configured to securely engage the stapling device 50 and thereby provide an
improved resection line 12. This may be by an abutting engagement. Alternatively, one or both of
the clamp members 42, 44 may have a first connector and the stapling device 50 may have a second
connector, wherein the first and second connectors are configured to movably couple the resection
line guide 40 with the stapling device 50 during the resection (not shown). By way of example, the
guide 40 may include connection features (not shown) such as a weak magnetic feature to attract the
stapling device 50, a channel that couples with a projection on the stapling device 50 that slides into
the channel, etc. Fig. 2D illustrates the application of the stapling device 50 to the stomach 10 along
the resection line guide 40. As conventional staplers are generally well known in the art, such staplers
will not be described herein in further detail.
[00127]    As noted above, the resection line guide 40 may be secured to the stomach 10 so that it does
not migrate or move once the surgeon begins stapling (e.g., the second clamping stage). Furthermore,
the resection line guide 40 may be generally positioned so that it does not interfere with the activation
of the stapling device 50 and ideal formation of each individual staple. As illustrated in Figs. 2A-2E,
the use of the resection line guide 40 aids in creating an ideal gastric sleeve pouch size and shape (Fig.
2E). In an embodiment such as one described above where the flexible ratchet includes a release
mechanism, the surgeon may engage the release mechanism after completing the resection of the
                                                     17

stomach 10. This allows the tab 46 to be released from the bore 48 such that the tab 46 may be moved
back through and free of the bore 48.        Consequently, the two clamp members 42, 44 may be
separated, and the resection line guide 40 may be removed from the abdominal cavity.
[00128]    In an alternative embodiment, the resection line guide may have an articulated configuration
for providing relative movement between the clamp members. In one embodiment, for example, a
hinge may be provided at one of the proximal or distal ends of the clamp members to provide
pivotable relative movement theiebetween. Such an embodiment is illustrated in Figs. 3A and 3B,
where the hinge may be configured as a living hinge. In this regard, a resection line guide 70 includes
a first clamp member 72 generally positionable on the anterior side 18 of the stomach 10 and a second
clamp member 74 generally positionable on the posterior side 20 of the stomach 10, where the first
clamp member 72 and the second clamp member 74 may be operatively coupled to effectuate a
clamping force on the stomach 10. In this embodiment, the clamp members 72, 74 may be configured
to be coupled at both the proximal and distal ends 14, 16 of the stomach 10. More particularly, the
distal ends of the clamp members 72, 74 may be configured as a hinge joint 76. As noted above, the
hinge joint 76 may be configured as a living hinge formed by a flexible band 78 having a first end
coupled to the first clamp member 72 adjacent a distal end 72a thereof and a second end coupled to
the second clamp member 74 adjacent a distal end 74a thereof. With such a living hinge, pivotal
movement between the clamp members 72, 74 may be achieved.              As illustrated in Fig. 3A, the
proximal end 74b of the second clamp member 74 may be received through the proximal end 72b of
the first clamp member 72. More particularly and similar to that above, the proximal end 74b of the
second clamp member 74 may include a serrated tab 46 and the proximal end 72b of the first clamp
member 72 may include a passage or bore 48 having an opening through which the serrated tab 46
may pass. While this embodiment is illustrated with the hinge joint 76 at the distal ends of the clamp
members 72, 74, it should be appreciated that in an alternative embodiment, the hinge joint 76 may be
at the proximal ends of the clamp members 72, 74 and the serrated tab 46/bore 48 may be at the distal
ends of the clamp members 72, 74 (not shown). Other arrangements may also be possible.
[00129]    The placement of the resection line guide 70 around the stomach 10 is illustrated in Fig. 3B.
In this regard, using laparoscopic instruments, the surgeon may manipulate the resection line guide 70
across the stomach 10 so that the first clamp member 72 is generally positioned along the anterior side
18 of the stomach 10 and the second clamp member 74 is generally positioned along the posterior side
20 of the stomach 10. The distal ends 72a, 74a of the clamp members 72, 74 may generally extend
beyond the distal end 16 of the stomach 10 and the proximal ends 72b, 74b of the clamp members 72,
74 may generally extend beyond the proximal end 14 of the stomach 10.            The flexible band 78
between the clamp members 72, 74 may loop or extend around the distal end 16 of the stomach 10, as
                                                    18

 WO 2015/095333                                                                    PCT/US2014/070869
illustrated in Fig. 3B. The clamp members 72, 74 may be manipulated so as to provide a clamping
force on the stomach 10.
[00130]    More particularly, the clamp members 72, 74 may be pivoted relative to each other in order
to position the resection line guide 70 relative to the stomach 10. To create a clamping force on the
stomach 10, the proximal end 72b of the first clamp member 72 and the proximal end 72b of the
second clamp member 74 may be coupled. For example, the serrated tab 46 may be pulled through
the bore 48 at the proximal end 72b of the first clamp member 72, such as with conventional graspers.
The securement of the resection line guide 70 to the stomach 10 may be achieved using the two-stage
clamping process as described above. More particularly, the tab 46 may be pulled through bore 48 so
as to generate a clamping force on the stomach 10 less than the threshold clamping force. This first
stage clamping force is configured and selected to provide a certain amount of resistance to movement
of the resection line guide 70 relative to the stomach 10. This resistance is configured to prevent
undesirable or unintentional movements of the resection line guide 70, but yet permit the surgeon to
move the resection line guide 70 to a desired position relative to the stomach 10 without significant
difficulty. In the second clamping stage, and with the resection line guide 70 in the desired location
relative to the stomach 10, the clamping force of the resection line guide 70 may be increased above
the threshold clamping force to effectively prevent or minimize the resection line guide 70 from
moving relative to the stomach 10. The upper limit to which the resection line guide 70 may be
clamped is selected so as to avoid any damage to the underlying tissue being clamped. This may be
achieved in this embodiment, for example, by pulling the tab 46 further through the bore 48.
[00131]    When the resection line guide 70 is placed on the stomach 10 (e.g., in the first clamping
stage as described above), the surgeon has a clear visualization of the intended results of the vertical
sleeve gastrectomy prior to actually performing the resection of the stomach 10 at the resection line
12. Hence, the surgeon has an indication of what the resultant stomach volume defined by the lesser
curvature 28 and the resection line 12 will be prior to cutting tissue. If the surgeon is not satisfied with
the indication of the expected stomach volume, the surgeon may adjust and manipulate the location
and alignment of the guide prior to stapling and cutting the stomach 10. Once the resection line guide
70 is finally positioned, the surgeon may then cut and staple the tissue using the resection line guide
70 as a track along the entire segment or a significant part of the segment until complete resection of
the stomach 10 occurs. In this regard, the stapling device 50 may abut or engage the resection line
guide 70 along an alignment surface to facilitate an improved resection line, similar to that shown
above in Fig. 2D.
[00132]    In another embodiment of an articulated configuration, the hinge that connects the first and
second clamping members may take the form of a selectively formable hinge which may, for

example, be formed internal to the abdominal cavity to provide pivotable relative movement between
the clamp members. Such an embodiment is illustrated in Figs. 3C and 3D. In this regard and as
shown in Fig. 3C, a resection line guide 54 includes a first clamp member 56 generally positionable
on the anterior side 18 of the stomach 10 and a second clamp member 58 generally positionable on
the posterior side 20 of the stomach 10, where the first clamp member 56 and the second clamp
member 58 may be operatively coupled to effectuate a clamping force on the stomach 10. In this
embodiment, the clamp members 56, 58 may be configured to be coupled at both the proximal and
distal ends 14, 16 of the stomach 10 (although the proximal end connection is not shown). More
particularly, the distal ends of the first and second clamp members 56, 58 may be configured as a
fonrable hinge joint. In this regard, the distal end of the second clamp member 58 may include a ring
or eyelet 57 having an opening, and the distal end of the first clamp member 56 may include a hook
59. With the hook 59 positioned within the eyelet 57, the hinge joint is assembled and pivotal
movement between the clamp members 56, 58 may be achieved. Though not shown in Fig. 3C, the
proximal ends of the clamp members 56, 58 may be configured to be coupled. By way of example
and without limitation, the proximal end of the second clamp member 58 may include a serrated tab
and the proximal end of the first clamp member 56 may include a passage or bore having an opening
through which the serrated tab may pass, similar to that above. Other types of connections at the
proximal ends are also possible.
[00133]    The placement of the resection line guide 54 around the stomach 10 is illustrated in Fig. 3D.
In this regard, using laparoscopic instruments, the second clamp member 58 may be inserted under
(posterior to) the stomach 10 so that the distal end of the second clamp member 58 generally extends
beyond the distal end 16 of the stomach 10 and the proximal end generally extends beyond the
proximal end 14 of the stomach 10. Next, the first clamp member 56 may be inserted over (anterior
to) the stomach 10 using laparoscopic instruments, for example, so that the distal end of the first
clamp member 56 generally extends beyond the distal end 16 of the stomach 10 and the proximal end
generally extends beyond the proximal end 14 of the stomach 10. In an advantageous aspect of this
embodiment, the distal end of the second clamp member 58 may be configured to flex or bend so that
the distal end extends upwardly and around the distal end 16 of the stomach 10. With the distal end of
the second clamp member 58 now essentially positioned on the anterior side 18 of the stomach 10, the
hook 59 at the distal end of the first clamp member 56 may be engaged within the eyelet 57, thereby
forming the hinge joint. This may be accomplished, for example, with conventional graspers (not
shown).    Being able to assemble the resection line guide 54 inside the abdominal cavity may be
advantageous in that it may allow for smaller trocars to be used because the entire guide does not have
to fit simultaneously through a single trocar.

[00134] With the hinge joint complete, the clamp members 56, 58 may be pivoted relative to each in
order to position the resection line guide 54 relative to the stomach 10. To create a clamping force on
the stomach 10, the proximal end of the first clamp member 56 and the proximal end of the second
clamp member 58 may be coupled (not shown). The securement of the resection line guide 54 to the
stomach 10 may be achieved using the two-stage clamping process as described above. The first
stage clamping force is less than a threshold clamping force and is configured and selected to provide
a certain amount of resistance to movement of the resection line guide 54 relative to the stomach 10.
This resistance is configured to prevent undesirable or unintentional movements of the resection line
guide 54, but yet permit the surgeon to move the resection line guide 54 to a desired position relative
to the stomach 10 without significant difficulty. In the second clamping stage, and with the resection
line guide 54 in the desired location relative to the stomach 10, the clamping force of the resection line
guide 54 may be increased above the threshold clamping force to effectively prevent or minimize the
resection line guide 54 from moving relative to the stomach 10. The upper limit to which the
resection line guide 54 may be clamped is selected so as to avoid any damage to the underlying tissue
being clamped.
[00135] When the resection line guide 54 is placed on the stomach 10 (e.g., in the first clamping
stage as described above), the surgeon has a clear visualization of the intended results of the vertical
sleeve gastrectomy prior to actually performing the division of the stomach 10 at the resection line 12.
Hence, the surgeon has an indication of what the resultant stomach volume defined by the lesser
curvature 28 and the resection line 12 will be prior to cutting tissue. If the surgeon is not satisfied with
the indication of the expected stomach volume, the surgeon may adjust and manipulate the location
and alignment of the resection line guide 54 prior to stapling and cutting the stomach 10. Once the
resection line guide 54 is finally positioned, the surgeon may then cut and staple the tissue using the
resection line guide 54 as a track along the entire segment or a significant part of the segment until
complete resection of the stomach 10 occurs. In this regard, the stapling device 50 may abut or
engage the resection line guide 54 along an alignment surface to facilitate an improved resection line,
similar to that shown above in Fig. 2D.
[00136] In another embodiment of an articulated configuration, the hinge that connects the first and
second clamping members may be a spring hinge. Such an embodiment is schematically illustrated in
Figs. 3E and 3F. In this regard and as shown in Fig. 3E, a resection line guide 60 includes a first
clamp member 62 generally positionable on the anterior side 18 of the stomach 10 and a second
clamp member 64 generally positionable on the posterior side 20 of the stomach 10, where the first
clamp member 62 and the second clamp member 64 may be operatively coupled to effectuate a
clamping force on the stomach 10. In this embodiment, the clamp members 62, 64 may be configured
                                                     21

 WO 2015/095333                                                                     PCT/US2014/070869
to be coupled at both the proximal and distal ends 14, 16 of the stomach 10. More particularly, the
distal ends of the clamp members 62, 64 may be configured as a hinge joint. In this regard, the distal
ends 62a, 64a of the clamp members 56, 58 may be coupled by the spring hinge 66, which allows for
pivotal movement between the clamp members 62, 64. Spring hinges are generally well known in the
art and thus will not be described in further detail herein. As illustrated in Fig. 3E, the proximal ends
62b, 64b of the clamp members 62, 64 may be configured to be coupled.                More particularly, the
proximal ends 62b, 64b may be coupled by a flexible member 68. Aspects of the flexible member
according to the present embodiment are described in more detail below. Other types of connections
at the proximal ends of the first and second clamp members 62, 64 are also possible. While this
embodiment is illustrated with the hinge joint at the distal ends of the clamp members 62, 64 and the
flexible member 68 at the proximal ends of the clamp members 62, 64, it should be appreciated that in
an alternative embodiment (not shown), the hinge joint may couple the proximal ends of the clamp
members 62, 64 and the flexible member 68 may couple the distal ends of the clamp members 62, 64.
[00137]    Though not shown, but as readily understood by one of ordinary skill in the art based on the
present description, the resection line guide 60 may be placed around the stomach 10. In this regard,
using laparoscopic instruments, the surgeon may manipulate the resection line guide 60 across the
stomach 10 so that the first clamp member 62 is generally positioned along the anterior side 18 of the
stomach 10 and the second clamp member 64 is generally positioned along the posterior side 20 of the
stomach 10. The distal ends 62a, 64a of the clamp members 62, 64 generally extend beyond the distal
end 16 of the stomach 10 and the proximal ends 62b, 64b of the clamp members 62, 64 generally
extend beyond the proximal end 14 of the stomach 10. The spring hinge 66 between the first and
second clamp members 62, 64 may extend around the distal end 16 of the stomach 10. With the
resection line guide 60 placed around the stomach 10, the clamp members 62, 64 may be pivoted
relative to each in order to position the resection line guide 60 relative to the stomach 10. This may be
done, for example, with conventional graspers. To create a clamping force on the stomach 10 (and as
is explained in further detail below), the ends of the flexible member 68 may be pulled, which
tensions the flexible member 68 and decreases the length of the flexible member 68 that is between
the clamp members 62, 64. As the ends of the flexible member 68 are pulled, the proximal ends 62b,
64b of the clamp members 62, 64 move towards each other, and the clamp members 62, 64 begin to
provide a clamping force on the stomach 10.
[00138]    The securement of the resection line guide 60 to the stomach 10 may be achieved using the
two-stage clamping process as described above. The first-stage clamping force is less than a threshold
clamping force and is configured and selected to provide a certain amount of resistance to movement
of the resection line guide 60 relative to the stomach 10.       This resistance is configured to prevent

undesirable or unintentional movements of the resection line guide 60, but yet permit the surgeon to
move the resection line guide 60 to a desired position relative to the stomach 10 without significant
difficulty. In the second clamping stage, and with the resection line guide 60 in the desired location
relative to the stomach 10, the clamping force of the resection line guide 60 may be increased above
the threshold clamping force to effectively prevent or minimize the resection line guide 60 from
moving relative to the stomach 10. The upper limit to which the resection line guide 60 may be
clamped is selected so as to avoid any damage to the underlying tissue being clamped. This may be
achieved by pulling further on the ends of the flexible member 68, which increases the tension on the
flexible member 68 and increases the clamping force provided by the clamp members 62, 64.
[00139]    When the resection line guide 60 is placed on the stomach 10 (e.g., in the first clamping
stage as described above), the surgeon has a clear visualization of the intended results of the vertical
sleeve gastrectomy prior to actually performing the division of the stomach 10 at the resection line 12.
Hence, the surgeon has an indication of what the resultant stomach volume defined by the lesser
curvature 28 and the resection line 12 will be prior to cutting tissue. If the surgeon is not satisfied with
the indication of the expected stomach volume, the surgeon may adjust and manipulate the location
and alignment of the resection line guide 60 prior to stapling and cutting the stomach 10. Once the
resection line guide 60 is finally positioned, the surgeon may then cut and staple the tissue using the
resection line guide 60 as a track along the entire segment or a significant part of the segment until
complete resection of the stomach 10 occurs.       In this regard, the stapling device 50 may abut or
engage the resection line guide 60 along an alignment surface to facilitate an improved resection line,
similar to that shown above in Fig. 2D.
[00140]    While the embodiment described in Figs. 3E and 3F had the flexible member 68 extending
only through the proximal ends 62b, 64b of the clamp members 62, 64, in an alternative embodiment,
the flexible member 68 may extend through substantially the full length of the clamp members 62, 64
such that it extends between the distal ends 62a, 64a of the clamp members 62, 64 along with the
spring hinge 66. This arrangement of the flexible member 68 is shown in phantom in Figs. 3E and
3F. This type of arrangement of the flexible member 68 is also described in more detail below. The
operation of this alternative embodiment is similar to that described above for Figs. 3E and 3F.
[00141]    In yet another embodiment, the resection line guide may have a pair of clamp members
coupled by an elongate flexible member capable of being tensioned so as to produce a clamping force
on an anatomical structure, such as stomach 10. Figs. 4A-4C illustrate such an embodiment. In this
regard and as shown in Fig. 4A, the resection line guide 80 includes a first clamp member 82
generally positionable on the anterior side 18 of the stomach 10 and a second clamp member 84
generally positionable on the posterior side 20 of the stomach 10, where the first clamp member 82

 WO 2015/095333                                                                  PCT/US2014/070869
and the second clamp member 84 may be operatively coupled by a flexible member 86 to effectuate a
clamping force on the stomach 10.       In an exemplary embodiment, the flexible member 86 may
include a flexible cable. However, other flexible members are contemplated, as noted below. In one
embodiment, the clamp members 82, 84 may be configured as hollow bodies having a generally
rectangular cross section and a length in a longitudinal direction which may exceed the length of the
stomach 10 along the resection line 12. In an alternative embodiment, however, the clamp members
82, 84 may be generally solid. Additionally, the cross-sectional shape of the clamp members may
also differ, as is noted below. In an exemplary embodiment, each of the clamp members 82, 84 may
be a unity, monolithic member. However, in an alternative embodiment, the clamp members 82, 84
may be formed from a plurality of individual clamp segments that collectively form a clamp member.
Such an embodiment, which is discussed below in greater detail, may allow the length of a clamp
member to be easily varied.
[00142]    In an exemplary embodiment, each of the clamp members 82, 84 may include openings 88
at their distal ends 82a, 84a and proximal ends 82b, 84b (or through bores in the case of solid clamp
members) so as to allow the flexible member 86 to extend through and along the length of the clamp
members 82, 84. In this configuration, the clamp members 82, 84 are essentially threaded onto the
flexible member 86. In this configuration, the clamp members 82, 84 are also generally movable
relative to the flexible member 86, such as along the length thereof. In an alternative embodiment, the
flexible member 86 does not have to extend through (e.g., internal of) the clamp members 82, 84, but
may extend along an outer surface of the clamp members 82, 84, such as through eyelets or the like
positioned along a surface of the clamp members 82, 84 (not shown). In a further alternative, both
clamp members 82, 84 do not have to be movable along the flexible member 86. For example, in one
embodiment, one of the clamp members 82, 84 may be fixed relative to the flexible member 86 and
the other of the clamp members 82, 84 may be movable relative to the flexible member 86.
[00143]    Figs. 4A and 4B illustrate the placement of the resection line guide 80 around the stomach
10. In this regard, using standard laparoscopic instruments and graspers, the surgeon may manipulate
the flexible member 86 around the distal end 16 of the stomach 10 without having one or both clamp
members 82, 84 thereon. The surgeon may then thread or manipulate the second clamp member 84
onto an end of the flexible member 86 and slide the second clamp member 84 along the flexible
member 86 until the second clamp member 84 is generally positioned on the posterior side 20 of the
stomach 10. In this regard, the distal end 84a may generally extend beyond the distal end 16 of the
stomach 10 and the proximal end 84b may generally extend beyond the proximal end 14 of the
stomach 10. Next, the surgeon may thread or manipulate the first clamp member 82 onto the flexible
member 86 such that the first clamp member 82 is generally positioned on the anterior side 18 of the
                                                   24

 WO 2015/095333                                                                 PCT/US2014/070869
stomach 10. For example, the first clamp member 82 may be threaded or manipulated onto the other
end of the flexible member 86. In this regard, the distal end 82a may generally extend beyond the
distal end 16 of the stomach 10 and the proximal end 82b may generally extend beyond the proximal
end 14 of the stomach 10. The order of applying the clamp members onto the flexible members may
be reversed. Being able to assemble the resection line guide 80 inside the abdominal cavity may be
advantageous in that it may allow for smaller trocars to be used because the entire guide does not have
to fit simultaneously through a single trocar.
[00144]    While the embodiment shown in Fig. 4A generally assembles the resection line guide 80
inside the abdominal cavity, in an alternative embodiment, as illustrated in Fig. 4C, the resection line
guide 94 may be pre-assembled and then inserted into the abdominal cavity as a unit. In this regard,
using standard laparoscopic instruments and graspers, the surgeon may manipulate the guide 94
across the stomach 10 so that the first clamp member 96 is generally positioned along the anterior side
18 of the stomach 10 and the second clamp member 98 is generally positioned along the posterior side
20 of the stomach 10. The distal ends 96a, 98a of the clamp members 96, 98 generally extend beyond
the distal end 16 of the stomach 10 and the proximal ends 96b, 98b of the clamp members 96, 98
generally extend beyond the proximal end 14 of the stomach 10. The section of the flexible member
86 between the clamp members 96, 98 may be loop or extend around the distal end 16 of the stomach
10, as illustrated in Fig. 4B. The clamp members 96, 98 may be manipulated so as to provide a
clamping force on the stomach 10.         This clamping may be achieved by tensioning the flexible
member 86.
[00145]    In this regard, the resection line guides 80, 94 may include a device for tensioning the
flexible member 86 thereby providing a clamping force on the anatomical structure, such as the
stomach 10 (the process being described below with reference to resection line guide 80). In this
regard, as the flexible member 86 is tensioned, the distance between the two clamp members 82, 84
decreases so as to impose a clamping force onto the stomach 10 captured therebetween.            In one
embodiment, for example, a tensioning device may include a tube 90 that operates in conjunction with
the flexible member 86 and clamp members 82, 84 to generate a clamping force between the clamp
members 82, 84. To this end, the flexible member 86 may extend through the tube 90 such that, for
example, the ends thereof may be positioned outside the body, and thereby be more easily
manipulated by the surgeon.       The ends of the flexible member 86 may also remain within the
abdominal cavity. In any event, the surgeon may then pull on the ends of the flexible member 86
while the end 92 of the tube 90 pushes against the proximal ends 82b, 84b of the clamp members 82,
84, which are not permitted to pass into the tube 90. When the flexible member 86 is initially pulled,
slack in the flexible member 86 is thereby taken up and the clamp members 82, 84 move towards each

 WO 2015/095333                                                                    PCT/US2014/070869
other. As the clamp members 82, 84 move towards each other, the clamping force on the stomach 10
begins to increase along the length of the clamp members 82, 84.            In addition, the length of the
intermediate segment of the flexible member 86 between the clamp members 82, 84 decreases.
Moreover, tensioning the flexible member 86 also generally aligns the clamp members 82, 84. For
example, tension in the flexible member 86 may generally vertically align the clamp members 82, 84
relative to the stomach 10. The clamp members 82, 84 may slide along the flexible member 86 during
this tensioning.
[00146]    The securement of the resection line guides 80, 94 to the stomach 10 may be achieved using
the two-stage clamping process as described above. More particularly, the flexible member 86 may
be pulled so as to generate a clamping force on the stomach 10 less than the threshold clamping force.
Again, this first-stage clamping force is configured and selected to provide a certain amount of
resistance to movement of the resection line guide 80 relative to the stomach 10. This resistance is
configured to prevent undesirable or unintentional movements of the resection line guide 80, but yet
pemiit the surgeon to move the resection line guide 80 to a desired position relative to the stomach 10
without significant difficulty. In the second clamping stage, and with the resection line guide 80 in the
desired location relative to the stomach 10, the clamping force of the resection line guide 80 may be
increased above the threshold clamping force to effectively prevent or minimize the resection line
guide 80 from moving relative to the stomach 10. The upper limit to which the resection line guide 80
may be clamped is selected so as to avoid any damage to the underlying tissue being clamped. This
may be achieved in this embodiment by pulling the ends of the flexible member 86 while pushing
further against the proximal ends 82b, 84b of the clamp members 82, 84 using the tube 90.
[00147] When the resection line guide 80 is placed on the stomach 10 (e.g., in the first clamping
stage as described above), the surgeon has a clear visualization of the intended results of the vertical
sleeve gastrectomy prior to actually performing the resection of the stomach 10 at the resection line
12. Hence, the surgeon has an indication of what the resultant stomach volume defined by the lesser
curvature 28 and the resection line 12 will be prior to cutting tissue. If the surgeon is not satisfied with
the indication of the expected stomach volume, the surgeon may adjust and manipulate the location
and alignment of the resection line guide 80 prior to stapling and cutting the stomach 10. Once the
resection line guide 80 is finally positioned (e.g., the second clamping stage as described above), the
surgeon may then cut and staple the tissue using the resection line guide 80 as a track along the entire
segment or a significant part of the segment until complete resection of the stomach 10 occurs. In this
regard, the stapling device 50 may abut or engage the resection line guide 80 along an alignment
surface to facilitate an improved resection line, similar to that shown above in Fig. 2D.
[00148]    In another alternative embodiment, and as alluded to above, a resection line guide may have

clamp members formed from a plurality of clamp segments in order to allow the length of the clamp
members to be more easily varied to fit a certain application. The figures shown in Figs. 5A-5E
illustrate such an embodiment. In this regard and as shown in Fig. 5A, the resection line guide 100
includes a first clamp member 102 generally positionable on the anterior side 18 of the stomach 10
and a second clamp member 104 generally positionable on the posterior side 20 of the stomach 10,
where the first clamp member 102 and the second clamp member 104 may be operatively coupled by
a flexible member 106 to effectuate a clamping force on the stomach 10.              In an exemplary
embodiment, the flexible member 106 may include               a flexible cable, however, alternative
embodiments of the flexible member, as described below, may also be used. As noted above, the
clamp members 102, 104 may be formed from a plurality of clamp segments 108 serially arranged in
order to form the clamp members 102, 104. In one embodiment, the clamp segments 108 may be
configured as hollow bodies having a generally rectangular cross section and a length in a longitudinal
direction which may be significantly less than the length of the stomach 10 along the resection line 12.
In an alternative embodiment, however, the clamp            segments   108 may be generally solid.
Additionally, the cross-sectional shape of the clamp segments 108 may also differ, as described
below.
[00149]    In an exemplary embodiment, each of the clamp segments 108 may include openings at
their distal ends and proximal ends (or through bores in the case of solid clamp members) so as to
allow the flexible member 106 to extend through the clamp segments 108. In this configuration, the
clamp segments 108 are essentially threaded onto the flexible member 106 and are also generally
movable relative to the flexible member 106, such as along the length thereof.        In an alternative
embodiment, the flexible member 106 does not have to extend through (e.g., internal of) the clamp
segments 108, but may extend along an outer surface of the clamp segments 108, such as through
eyelets or the like along a surface of the clamp segments 108 (not shown). Adjacent clamp segments
108 of the first and second clamp members 102, 104 may be configured to couple to each other, such
as using a tape or other type of fastener. Alternatively, adjacent clamp segments 108 may simply be
configured to abut each other without any fixed connection therebetween. For example, each adjacent
segment may include a confronting, generally planar faces which abut against each other when the
flexible member 106 is tensioned.
[00150]    In still a further alternative embodiment, adjacent clamp segments 108 of the clamp
members 102, 104 may be configured to abut each other, and include an interlock configuration
between the two adjacent clamp segments.        For example, Fig. 5F illustrates two adjacent clamp
segments 108a and 108b including an interlock configuration. In this regard, clamp segment 108a
includes a projection 108c that extends from the main body of the clamp segment 108a, and clamp
                                                   27

 WO 2015/095333                                                                PCT/US2014/070869
segment 108b includes a recess 108d that extends into the main body of the clamp segment 108b.
When the flexible member 106 is tensioned, the adjacent clamp segments 108a, 108b engage each
other through abutting contact.      More particularly, however, when the flexible member 106 is
tensioned, the projection 108c is positioned within the recess 108d to provide the interlock. The
interlock between adjacent clamp segments 108 may more firmly stabilize the clamp members 102,
104 during use but yet also allow for a variable length.
[00151]   Figs. 5B and 5C illustrate the placement of the resection line guide 100 around the stomach
10 in accordance with another embodiment. In this regard, using standard laparoscopic instruments
and graspers, the surgeon may manipulate a leading end 106b of the flexible member 106 over the
stomach 10 along the anterior side 18 and pull it around to the posterior side 20 of the stomach 10,
such as with a grasper 112. The leading end 106b of the flexible member 106 may then be pulled
around the stomach 10 until the second clamp member 104 is generally positioned on the posterior
side 20 of the stomach 10 and the first clamp member 102 is generally positioned on the anterior side
18 of the stomach 10, as shown in Fig. 5C. At this point, should there be any need to vary the length
of either of the first or second clamp members 102, 104, clamp segments 108 may be added or
removed to provide the desired length to the clamp members 102, 104. For example, in order to add a
segment, a new clamp segment 108 may be threaded onto an end (dictated by which clamp member is
having its length adjusted) of the flexible member 106 and slid along the length thereof to position the
segment in the desired location.
[00152]   In one embodiment, the distal end 104a of the second clamp member 104 may generally
extend beyond the distal end 16 of the stomach 10 and the proximal end 104b of the second clamp
member 104 may generally extend beyond the proximal end 14 of the stomach 10. Similarly, the
distal end 102a of the first clamp member 102 may generally extend beyond the distal end 16 of the
stomach 10 and the proximal end 102b of the first clamp member 102 may generally extend beyond
the proximal end 14 of the stomach 10. It should be realized that while most of the clamp members
102, 104 (e.g., but for slight adjustments in length) may be pre-assembled before the resection line
guide 100 is inserted into the abdominal cavity, in an alternative embodiment, the flexible member
106 may be positioned around the stomach 10 first and then the clamp members 102, 104 assembled
onto the flexible member 106, in a manner similar to that described above in Fig. 4A. Being able to
assemble the resection line guide 100 inside the abdominal cavity may be advantageous in that it may
allow for smaller trocars to be used because the entire guide does not have to fit simultaneously
through a single trocar. In any event, the clamp members 102, 104 may be manipulated so as to
provide a clamping force on the stomach 10. This clamping force may be achieved by tensioning the
flexible member 106.

 WO 2015/095333                                                                 PCT/US2014/070869
[00153]    In this regard, the resection line guide 100 may include a device for tensioning the flexible
member 106, thereby providing a clamping force on the anatomical structure, such as the stomach 10.
In one embodiment, for example, a tensioning device may include a cinch ring 110 and a cinch tube
90 that are configured to operate in conjunction with the flexible member 106 and the clamp members
102, 104 to generate a clamping force between the clamp members 102, 104. To this end, the flexible
member 106 may extend through the cinch ring 110 and tube 90 such that, for example, the ends
106a, 106b thereof may be positioned outside the body, and thereby more easily manipulated by the
surgeon. The ends 106a, 106b may also remain in the abdominal cavity but be positioned proximal of
the cinch ring 110 and tube 90. The surgeon may then pull on the ends 106a, 106b of the flexible
member 106 while the end 92 of the tube 90 pushes against the proximal end 114 of the cinch ring
110. Eventually, the distal end 116 of the cinch ring 110 will engage against the proximal ends 102b,
104b of the clamp members 102, 104, which are not permitted to pass through the cinch ring 110.
When the flexible member 106 is initially pulled, slack in the flexible member 106 is thereby taken up
and the clamping force on the stomach 10 begins to increase, as illustrated in Fig. 5D. The clamp
members 102, 104, and the clamp segments 108 that form these members, may slide along the
flexible member 106 during this tensioning. The cinch ring 110 is configured to maintain tension in
the flexible member 106 once it is applied. For example, the cinch ring 110 may be a rubber ring or
the like such that friction maintains the tension in the flexible member 106. The cinch ring 110 may
take other forns to maintain the tension in the flexible member 106.
[00154]    The securement of the resection line guide 100 to the stomach 10 may be achieved using the
two-stage clamping process as described above. More particularly, the flexible member 106 may be
pulled so as to generate a clamping force on the stomach 10 less than the threshold clamping force.
Again, this first-stage clamping force is configured and selected to provide a certain amount of
resistance to movement of the resection line guide 100 relative to the stomach 10. This resistance is
configured to prevent undesirable or unintentional movements of the resection line guide 100, but yet
permit the surgeon to move the resection line guide 100 to a desired position relative to the stomach
10 without significant difficulty. In the second clamping stage, and with the resection line guide 100
in the desired location relative to the stomach 10, the clamping force of the resection line guide 100
may be increased above the threshold clamping force to effectively prevent or minimize the resection
line guide 100 from moving relative to the stomach 10, as shown in Fig. 5E. The upper limit to which
the guide 100 may be clamped is selected so as to avoid any damage to the underlying tissue being
clamped. This may be achieved in this embodiment by pulling the ends 106a, 106b of the flexible
member 106 while pushing against the proximal ends 102b, 104b of the clamp members 102, 104
using the tube 90 and cinch ring 110.

[00155]   When the resection line guide 100 is placed on the stomach 10 (e.g., in the first clamping
stage as described above), the surgeon has a clear visualization of the intended results of the vertical
sleeve gastrectomy prior to actually performing the section of the stomach 10 at the resection line
12. Hence, the surgeon has an indication of what the resultant stomach volume defined by the lesser
curvature 28 and the resection line 12 will be prior to cutting tissue. If the surgeon is not satisfied with
the indication of the expected stomach volume, the surgeon may adjust and manipulate the location
and alignment of the resection line guide prior to stapling and cutting the stomach 10. Once the
resection line guide 100 is finally positioned (e.g., the second clamping stage as described above), the
surgeon may then cut and staple the tissue using the resection line guide 100 as a track along the entire
segment or a significant part of the segment until complete resection of the stomach 10 occurs. In this
regard, the stapling device 50 may abut or engage the resection line guide 100 along an alignment
surface to facilitate an improved resection line, similar to that shown above in Fig. 2D.
[00156]   Fig. 6 illustrates another embodiment of a resection line guide in accordance with an
embodiment of the invention where the clamp members may include a biasing mechanism that biases
the clamp members toward one another, thereby generating a clamping force when the guide is placed
about an anatomical structure. In this regard, a resection line guide 120 includes a first clamp member
122 generally positionable on the anterior side 18 of the stomach 10 and a second clamp member 124
generally positionable on the posterior side 20 of the stomach 10, where the first clamp member 122
and the second clamp member 124 may be operatively coupled to effectuate a clamping force on the
stomach 10. In an exemplary embodiment, the first and second clamp members 122, 124 may be
coupled by a first flexible member 126 and a second flexible member 128. More particularly, the first
flexible member 126 may have a first end 130 fixed to the first clamp member 122 adjacent the distal
end 122a thereof and pass out of the first clamp member 122 adjacent the distal end 122a. The
flexible member 126 may then pass into the second clamp member 124 adjacent a distal end 124a
thereof and extend along at least a portion of the second clamp member 124 toward the proximal end
124b thereof. A second end 132 of the flexible member 126 may be fixed to the second clamp
member 124 by a biasing device 134, which when activated creates a tension in the first flexible
member 126. The biasing device 134 may be generally positioned adjacent a central portion of the
clamp member 124.         Other positions, however, are possible.     In an exemplary embodiment, the
biasing device 134 may include a spring, an elastic deformable block (e.g., a rubber block), or other
device capable of being biased so as to generate a tension in the first flexible member 126. In an
alternate embodiment, the length of the flexible members 126, 128 that is between the clamp
members 122, 124 may be externally controlled. For example, the flexible members 126, 128 may be
externally manipulated to cause the clamp members 122, 124 to be separated by about 2 to 6 cm,

while keeping the clamp members 122, 124 generally parallel. Consequently, the surgeon would not
separate the clamp members 122, 124 laparoscopically.
[00157]    In a similar manner, the second flexible member 128 may have a first end 136 fixed to the
first clamp member 122 adjacent the proximal end 122b thereof and pass out of the first clamp
member 122 adjacent the proximal end 122b. The flexible member 128 may then pass into the
second clamp member 124 adjacent a proximal end 124b thereof and extend along at least a portion of
the second clamp member 124 toward the distal end 124a thereof. A second end 138 of the flexible
member 128 is fixed to the second clamp member 124 by a biasing device 140, which when activated
creates a tension in the second flexible member 128.        The biasing device 140 may be generally
positioned adjacent a central portion of the clamp member 124.            Other positions, however, are
possible. It should be appreciated that the flexible members and biasing devices may be provided in a
different arrangement as that shown in Fig. 6. For example, in an alternative embodiment, the biasing
devices may be located in the first clamp member 122. In still a further alternative embodiment, one
biasing device may be located in the first clamp member 122 and the second biasing device may be
located in the second clamp member 124. Other arrangements may also be possible.
[00158]    In a manner similar to that described above but not shown, after the stomach 10 has been
effectively mobilized along the greater curvature 26, the resection line guide 120 may be inserted into
the abdominal cavity through a surgical trocar and positioned along the stomach 10. Once inside the
abdominal cavity, the surgeon may spread the first and second clamp members 122, 124 apart from
each other using standard laparoscopic instruments and graspers, for example. In this regard, the
clamp members 122, 124 may include attachment points or tabs (not shown) that facilitate grasping
the clamp members by the laparoscopic instruments. As the clamp members 122, 124 move apart, the
biasing devices 134, 140 activate (or they are pre-activated) to create a biasing force in a direction that
directs the clamp members 122, 124 toward each other.            This biasing force, however, may be
overcome by the surgeon using the graspers in order to allow the surgeon to locate the resection line
guide 120 on the stomach 10, where the first clamp member 122 generally extends along the anterior
side 18 of the stomach 10 and the second clamp member 124 generally extends along the posterior
side 20 of the stomach 10. When the desired position of the resection line 12 is reached, the surgeon
may slowly release the hold on the clamp members 122, 124 with the graspers. Due to the bias of the
biasing devices 134, 140, the clamp members 122, 124 move toward each other and generate a
clamping force on the tissue between the members.
[00159]    The biasing devices 134, 140 may be selected to provide a clamping force effective to
prevent or minimize the resection line guide 120 from moving relative to the stomach 10. Due the
particular design of this embodiment, there may only be a single stage of clamping to secure the
                                                    31

resection line guide 120 on the stomach 10. The upper limit to which the resection line guide 120
may be clamped is selected so as to avoid any damage to the underlying tissue being clamped. This
clamping force may be controlled by properly selecting the biasing generated by the biasing devices
134, 140. For example, when the biasing devices 134, 140 are configured as springs, the spring
constants may be selected to provide the desired clamping force.
[00160]    When the resection line guide 120 is initially placed on the stomach 10, the surgeon has a
clear visualization of the intended results of the vertical sleeve gastrectomy prior to actually
performing the resection of the stomach 10 at the resection line 12.            Hence, the surgeon has an
indication of what the resultant stomach volume defined by the lesser curvature 28 and the resection
line 12 will be prior to cutting tissue. If the surgeon is not satisfied with the indication of the expected
stomach volume, the surgeon may adjust and manipulate the location and alignment of the resection
line guide 120 prior to stapling and cutting the stomach 10. For example, the laparoscopic graspers
may be used to separate the clamp members 122, 124 and thereby allow the resection line guide 120
to be moved to an alternate position.        In any event, once the resection line guide 120 is finally
positioned, the surgeon may then cut and staple the tissue using the resection line guide 120 as a track
along the entire segment or a significant part of the segment until complete resection of the stomach
10 occurs. In this regard, the stapling device 50 may abut or engage the resection line guide 120 along
an alignment surface to facilitate an improved resection line, similar to that shown above in Fig. 2D.
[00161]    Similar to the embodiment shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 7 illustrates another embodiment of a
resection line guide in accordance with an embodiment of the invention where the clamp members
may include a biasing mechanism that biases the clamp members toward one another to generate a
clamping force when the guide is placed about an anatomical structure.              In this embodiment, a
resection line guide 142 includes a first clamp member 144 generally positionable on the anterior side
18 of the stomach 10 and a second clamp member 146 generally positionable on the posterior side 20
of the stomach 10, where the first clamp member 144 and the second clamp member 146 may be
operatively coupled to effectuate a clamping force on the stomach 10. In an exemplary embodiment,
the first and second clamp members 144, 146 may be coupled by a first member 148 and a second
member 150. More particularly, the first member 148 may have a first end 152 coupled to the first
clamp member 148 adjacent the distal end 144a thereof and a second end 154 coupled to the second
clamp member 146 adjacent the distal end 146a thereof. In a similar manner, the second member 150
may have a first end 156 coupled to the first clamp member 144 adjacent the proximal end 144b
thereof and a second end 158 coupled to the second clamp member 146 adjacent the proximal end
146b thereof. In accordance with this embodiment, the first and second members 144, 146 may be
configured to be biased so as to generate a clamping force between the clamp members.

[00162] In one embodiment, for example, the first and second members 148, 150 may be configured
as elastic bands (e.g., rubber bands) such that when the bands are pulled apart, tension is created
within the members 148, 150 that tends to drive the clamp members 144, 146 toward each other. In
another embodiment, the first and second members 144, 146 may be formed as shape memory
elements. Shape memory elements have a set shape that they essentially "remember" such that when
the shape elements are deformed, they generate a return force directing the element back to its set or
remembered shape. By way of example and without limitation, the shape memory elements may take
the form of nitinol (NiTi) wires, bands, cables or such wires, bands or cables made of other shape
memory materials. The shape memory elements may be those described in U.S. Patent Application
Publication No. 2009/0012545, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The
shape memory elements may also take other forms.
[00163] In a manner similar to that described above, after the stomach 10 has been effectively
mobilized along the greater curvature 26, the resection line guide 142 may be inserted into the
abdominal cavity through a surgical trocar and positioned along the stomach 10. Once inside the
abdominal cavity, the surgeon may spread the first and second clamp members 144, 146 apart from
each other using standard laparoscopic instruments and graspers, for example. In this regard, the
clamp members 144, 146 may include attachment points (not shown) that facilitate grasping the
clamp members 144, 146 by the laparoscopic instruments. As the clamp members 144, 146 move
apart, the first and second members 148, 150 generate a biasing force in a direction that directs the
clamp members 144, 146 toward each other. This biasing force, however, may be overcome by the
surgeon using the graspers in order to allow the surgeon to locate the resection line guide 142 on the
stomach 10, where the first clamp member 144 generally extends along the anterior side 18 of the
stomach 10 and the second clamp member 146 generally extends along the posterior side 20 of the
stomach 10. When the desired position of the resection line 12 is reached, the surgeon may slowly
release the hold on the clamp members 144, 146 with the graspers. Due to the bias of the members
148, 150, the clamp members 144, 146 move toward each other and generate a clamping force on the
tissue between the members.
[00164] The biasing force from the members 148, 150 may be selected to provide a clamping force
effective to prevent or minimize the resection line guide 142 from moving relative to the stomach 10.
Due the particular design of this embodiment, there may only be a single stage of clamping to secure
the resection line guide 142 on the stomach 10. The upper limit to which the resection line guide 142
may be clamped is selected so as to avoid any damage to the underlying tissue being clamped. This
clamping force may be controlled by properly selecting the biasing generated by the members 148,
150. For example, when the first and second members 148, 150 are formed from shape memory
                                                   33

 WO 2015/095333                                                                     PCT/US2014/070869
elements, the set position of the elements may be selected in a manner that controls the ultimate
clamping force of the clamp members 144, 146.
[00165]   When the resection line guide 142 is initially placed on the stomach 10, the surgeon has a
clear visualization of the intended results of the vertical sleeve gastrectomy prior to actually
performing the resection of the stomach 10 at the resection line 12. Hence, the surgeon has an
indication of what the resultant stomach volume defined by the lesser curvature 28 and the resection
line 12 will be prior to cutting tissue. If the surgeon is not satisfied with the indication of the expected
stomach volume, the surgeon may adjust and manipulate the location and alignment of the resection
line guide 142 prior to stapling and cutting the stomach 10. For example, the laparoscopic graspers
may be used to separate the clamp members 144, 146 and thereby allow the resection line guide 142
to be moved to an alternate position.        In any event, once the resection line guide 142 is finally
positioned, the surgeon may then cut and staple the tissue using the resection line guide 142 as a track
along the entire segment or a significant part of the segment until complete resection of the stomach
occurs. In this regard, the stapling device 50 may abut or engage the resection line guide 142 along an
alignment surface to facilitate an improved resection line, similar to that shown above in Fig. 2D.
[00166]   In yet another embodiment, a resection line guide may include a pair of clamp members
having magnetic characteristics or features to produce a clamping force on an anatomical structure,
such as stomach 10. Figs. 8A-8C illustrate such an embodiment. In this regard and as shown in Fig.
8A, a resection line guide 160 includes a first clamp member 162 generally positionable on the
anterior side 18 of the stomach 10 and a second clamp member 164 generally positionable on the
posterior side 20 of the stomach 10, where the first clamp member 162 and the second clamp member
164 may be configured to effectuate a clamping force on the stomach 10. More particularly, clamp
members 162, 164 are configured to magnetically couple to each other to provide a clamping force on
the stomach 10.     In this regard, the clamp members 162, 164 may be magnetized using methods
known in the art. For example, the clamp members 162, 164 may be coated in a ferromagnetic metal
or other ferromagnetic material.       As an alternative, the clamp members 162, 164 may contain a
ferromagnetic metal or other ferromagnetic material. The ferromagnetic metal or other material may
span the entire length of the clamp members 162, 164 or may only cover a portion of their entire
length.  In an exemplary embodiment, the clamp members 162, 164 may be formed as elongate
members made of a ferromagnetic metal having a generally cylindrical cross-section and a length
generally exceeding that of the stomach 10. However, other arrangements are possible as described
below.
[00167]   Fig. 8B illustrates the resection line guide 160 placed on the stomach 10. In this regard,
using standard laparoscopic instruments and graspers, the surgeon may insert the second clamp
                                                     34

 WO 2015/095333                                                                     PCT/US2014/070869
member 164 into the abdominal cavity and position the second clamp member 164 generally on the
posterior side 20 of the stomach 10. More particularly, the distal end 164a may generally extend
beyond the distal end 16 of the stomach 10 and the proximal end 164b may generally extend beyond
the proximal end 14 of the stomach 10. Next, the surgeon may insert the first clamp member 162 into
the abdominal cavity and position the first clamp member 162 generally on the anterior side 18 of the
stomach 10. In this regard, the distal end 162a may generally extend beyond the distal end 16 of the
stomach 10 and the proximal end 162b may generally extend beyond the proximal end 14 of the
stomach 10. Being able to assemble the resection line guide 160 inside the abdominal cavity may be
advantageous in that it may allow for smaller trocars to be used because the entire guide does not have
to fit simultaneously through a single trocar. In any event, as the clamp members 162, 164 are
brought together, a magnetic force developed between the two clamp members 162, 164 tends to
drive the clamp members toward each other, similar to the biasing force in Figs. 6 and 7 above. This
magnetic force, however, may be overcome by the surgeon using the graspers in order to allow the
surgeon to locate the resection line guide 160 on the stomach 10. When the desired position of the
resection line 12 is reached, the surgeon may slowly release the hold on one of both of the clamp
members 162, 164 with the graspers. Due to the magnetic attraction, the clamp members 162, 164
move toward each other and generate a clamping force on the tissue between the members.
[00168]   The magnetic force may be selected to provide a clamping force effective to prevent or
minimize the resection line guide 160 from moving relative to the stomach 10. Due the particular
design of this embodiment, there may only be a single stage of clamping to secure the resection line
guide 160 on the stomach 10. The upper limit to which the guide 160 may be clamped is selected so
as to avoid any damage to the underlying tissue being clamped.               This clamping force may be
controlled by properly selecting the magnetic characteristics of the clamp members 162, 164. Those
of ordinary skill in the art will understand how to configure the magnetic characteristics of the clamp
members 162, 164 in order to achieve a desired clamping force.
[00169] When the resection line guide 160 is initially placed on the stomach 10, the surgeon has a
clear visualization of the intended results of the vertical sleeve gastrectomy prior to actually
performing the resection of the stomach 10 at the resection line 12. Hence, the surgeon has an
indication of what the resultant stomach volume defined by the lesser curvature 28 and the resection
line 12 will be prior to cutting tissue. If the surgeon is not satisfied with the indication of the expected
stomach volume, the surgeon may adjust and manipulate the location and alignment of the resection
line guide 160 prior to stapling and cutting the stomach 10. For example, the laparoscopic graspers
may be used to separate and move the clamp members 162, 164 and thereby allow the resection line
guide 160 to be moved to an alternate position. In any event, once the resection line guide 160 is
                                                     35

 WO 2015/095333                                                                   PCT/US2014/070869
finally positioned, the surgeon may then cut and staple the tissue using the section line guide 160 as
a track along the entire segment or a significant part of the segment until complete resection of the
stomach 10 occurs. In this regard, the stapling device 50 may abut or engage the resection line guide
160 along an alignment surface to facilitate an improved resection line, similar to that shown above in
Fig. 2D.
[00170]    In an alternative embodiment, the resection line guide 160 may be used in combination with
a bougie 166, which is generally known in the art and facilitates placement of the resection line guide
160 along the intended resection line 12. In this regard, the surgeon may position the bougie 166
inside the stomach 10 by insertion through the mouth, for example (Fig. 8A). With the bougie 166 so
positioned, it defines an alignment surface 168 which may be used to properly position the first and
second clamp members 162, 164 along the intended resection line 12, as described above. In a further
alternative embodiment, the bougie 166 may include magnetic features that provide a magnetic
attraction force between the bougie 166 and one or both of the clamp members 162, 164.                  For
example, the bougie 166 may be coated in a ferromagnetic metal or other ferromagnetic material.
Alternatively, the bougie 166 may contain a ferromagnetic metal or other ferromagnetic material. The
ferromagnetic metal or other material may span the entire length of the bougie or may only cover a
portion of the entire length of the bougie. hi these embodiments, the clamp member 162, 164 may be
attracted solely to the bougie 166 in order to generate the clamping force to secure the resection line
guide 160 to the stomach 10. hi an alternative embodiment, however, the clamp members 162, 164
may be magnetically attracted to both the bougie 166 and the other clamp member. In a still further
alternative embodiment, only one of the clamp members may be magnetically attracted to the bougie
166 and the other clamp member may be attracted solely to the other clamp member. Those of
ordinary skill in the art may recognize other arrangements for generating a clamping force using
magnetic attraction of the clamp members and a bougie.
[00171]    Figs. 9A and 9B illustrate another embodiment of a resection line guide utilizing magnetic
attraction forces that facilitate locating the clamp members and/or that facilitate generating a clamping
force on an anatomical structure, such as stomach 10.             This embodiment differs from other
embodiments in that each clamp member does not extend along the anatomical structure for
substantially the full length of the intended resection line 12. hi this regard, and as illustrated in Figs.
9A and 9B, the resection line guide 170 includes a pair of retaining clips 172 and 174. Each retaining
clip 172, 174 includes a guide portion 176 and a resilient arm 178 extending from guide portion 176
and in general parallel relation thereto (e.g., so as to form a u-shaped profile). The resilient arm 178
may be formed from metal, plastic or other materials suitable for a biological environment and
capable of providing a resilient clamping force with guide portion 176. In this embodiment, the guide
                                                     36

 WO 2015/095333                                                                 PCT/US2014/070869
portions 176 may be magnetized using methods known in the art. For example, the guide portions
176 may be coated in a ferromagnetic metal or other ferromagnetic material. As an alternative, the
guide portions 176 may contain a ferromagnetic metal or other ferromagnetic material.                The
ferromagnetic metal or other material may span the entire length of the guide portions 176 or may
only cover a portion of their entire length. The length and width of the retaining clips 172, 174 may
be varied according to surgeon preference and the procedure in which they are intended to be used.
By way of example and without limitation, the width may range from 0.5 to 1 cm, and the length may
range from 2 to 10 cm.
[00172]   Fig. 9B illustrates the resection line guide 170 placed on the stomach 10. In this regard, the
surgeon may position the bougie 166 inside the stomach 10 by insertion through the mouth, for
example. With the bougie 166 so positioned, it defines an aligmnent surface 168 which may be used
to properly position the first and second retaining clips 172 and 174 along the intended resection line
12. Using standard laparoscopic instruments and graspers, the surgeon may insert the first retaining
clip 172 into the abdominal cavity and position the first retaining clip 172 at the proximal end 14 of
the stomach 10. In this regard, the guide portion 176 is generally positioned on the anterior side 18 of
the stomach 10 and the resilient arm 178 extends around the proximal end 14 and is generally
positioned along the posterior side 20 of the stomach 10. In a similar manner, the second retaining
clip 174 may be positioned at the distal end 16 of the stomach 10. The resiliency of the arm 178
generates a clamping force so as to secure the retaining clip 172 to the stomach 10. In addition to this,
however, a magnetic force develops between the guide portion 176 of the retaining clip 172 and the
bougie 166. This magnetic force, however, may be overcome by the surgeon using the graspers in
order to allow the surgeon to locate the retaining clip 172 on the stomach 10. When the desired
position of the resection line 12 is reached, the surgeon may slowly release the hold on the retaining
clip 172 with the graspers. Due to the magnetic attraction, the guide portion 176 and the bougie 166
move toward each other and generate a clamping force on the tissue therebetween. Once placed on
the stomach 10 and mated with the bougie 166, the surgeon may adjust the axial position of the
retaining clip 172 relative to the retaining clip 174 to flatten the stomach and provide a flat, straight
stapling surface.
[00173]   The magnetic force may be selected to provide a clamping force effective to prevent or
minimize the resection line guide 170 from moving relative to the stomach 10. Similar to previous
embodiments, there may be a two-stage clamping process for securing the resection line guide 170 on
the stomach 10. In this regard, the guide portion 176 and the resilient arm 178 may be configured to
generate a clamping force on the stomach 10 less than the threshold clamping force. This first-stage
clamping force is configured and selected to provide a certain amount of resistance to movement of
                                                     37

 WO 2015/095333                                                                 PCT/US2014/070869
the resection line guide 170 relative to the stomach 10 (e.g., movement of the retaining clips 172, 174
along the stomach 10).         This resistance is configured to prevent undesirable or unintentional
movements of the resection line guide 170, but yet permit the surgeon to move the resection line guide
170 to a desired position relative to the stomach 10 without significant difficulty. In the second
clamping stage, the clamping force of the resection line guide 170 may be increased above the
threshold clamping force due to the magnetic forces developed between the guide portions 176 and
the bougie 166. The upper limit to which the resection line guide 170 may be clamped is selected so
as to avoid any damage to the underlying tissue being clamped.
[00174]    When the resection line guide 170 is initially placed on the stomach 10, the surgeon has a
clear visualization of the intended results of the vertical sleeve gastrectomy prior to actually
performing the resection of the stomach 10 at the resection line 12. Although the resection line guide
170 may not extend across substantially the full length of the resection line 12, the two retaining clips
172, 174, and more specifically, the guide portions 176 thereof, may provide an effective visualization
of the intended resection line 12, by demonstrating the beginning and ending portions of the resection
line 12. By way of example, the two retaining clips 172, 174 may collectively extend between about
20% and about 100% of the resection line 12, and preferably between 40% and 100% of the resection
line. Hence, the surgeon has a sufficiently good indication of what the resultant stomach volume
defined by the lesser curvature 28 and the resection line 12 will be prior to cutting tissue. If the
surgeon is not satisfied with the indication of the expected stomach volume, the surgeon may adjust
and manipulate the location and alignment of the retaining clips 172, 174 prior to stapling and cutting
the stomach 10.     For example, the laparoscopic graspers may be used to separate and move the
retaining clips 172, 174 and thereby allow the resection line guide 170 to be moved to an alternate
position. In any event, once the resection line guide 170 is finally positioned, the surgeon may then
cut and staple the tissue using the resection line guide 170 as a track along a significant part of the
segment until complete resection of the stomach 10 occurs. In this regard, the stapling device 50 may
abut or engage the resection line guide 170 along an alignment surface to facilitate an improved
resection line, similar to that shown above in Fig. 2D.
[00175]    It should be appreciated that the resection line guides described above may be modified in
several ways, but remain within the scope and spirit of the present invention.           In this regard,
embodiments of the present invention may include a light source configured to cooperate with a light
collector or sensor to provide an indication of tissue thickness. In reference to Figs. 1OA-1OC, a
resection line guide 180 includes a first clamp member 182 and a second clamp member 184 coupled
by a living hinge 186, similar to that shown in Figs. 3A and 3B above. When placed on the stomach
10, the second clamp member 184 may be generally positioned on the posterior side 20 of the
                                                    38

stomach 10, and the first clamp member 182 may be generally positioned on the anterior side 18 of
the stomach 10. In accordance with this embodiment, at least a portion of the second clamp member
184 may be made from a transparent or material, such as a transparent plastic like polycarbonate or
other suitable biocompatible material, and include one or more light sources 188 configured to emit
light into the tissue being clamped. In one embodiment, for example, the light sources may include a
series of LEDs spaced along the second clamp member 184. It should be appreciated, however, that
the light source can be other suitable sources for emitting light. At least a portion of the light from the
light source 188 is transmitted through the stomach tissue and is received at the first clamp member
182. At least a portion of the first clamp member 182 may be transparent and include one or more
light sensors 190 configured to measure the amount of light being received. As can be appreciated by
one of ordinary skill in the art, the amount of light received at the sensors 190 may have a
determinable correlation to the thickness of the tissue through which the light is transmitted. In this
regard, the resection line guide 180 may be operatively coupled to a controller or other processor (not
shown) capable of determining the tissue thickness based upon the amount of light emitted by the
light source 188 and that received by sensors 190.        Such a thickness determination may aid the
surgeon in choosing the proper staple size along the resection line 12.
[00176]    In embodiments of the present invention that include a flexible member for tensioning the
clamp members, it should be appreciated that the flexible member may take several forms. By way of
example and without limitation, the flexible member may include a wire, suture, thread, chain, or
other elongate flexible member. The flexible member may be made of metal, plastic, or any other
material that is suitable for a biological environment. The flexible member may be, for example, a
braided cable. The flexible member should be capable of a radius of bend of approximately 0.030
inches and further be generally resistant to kinking, knotting, etc. Additionally, the flexible member
should be able to accommodate a tensile load sufficient to generate a clamping force (pressure) above
the maximum clamping force expected to be imposed during a procedure. By way of example, the
flexible member should be able to accommodate a tensile load sufficient to create a clamping force of
about 12 g/mm 2 on the anatomical structure. For example, the flexible member should be able to
accommodate a tensile load of between about 25 to 50 lbs. In an exemplary embodiment, the flexible
member may be a multi-strand stainless steel cable or a polymer, such as vectran.
[00177] In addition to the above, there may be several alternative arrangements of the flexible
member relative to the clamp members in the disclosed resection line guides. In this regard, Figs.
11 A-1 1C are schematic illustrations of exemplary configurations of two clamp members 192, 194 and
a flexible member 196 configured to be tensioned so as provide a clamping force between the clamp
members 192, 194. In Fig. 11 A, the flexible member 196 has a first end 196a which is fixed to clamp

member 194 adjacent a distal end 194a thereof and passes through the second clamp member 194
adjacent the distal end 194a. Flexible member 196 then passes through the first clamp member 192
adjacent a distal end 192a thereof and through and out of the first clamp member 192 adjacent a
proximal end 192b thereof. The second end 196b of the flexible member 196 may be positioned
outside the body and pulled or otherwise manipulated by the surgeon so as to increase the tension in
the flexible member 196, and thereby generate a clamping force between clamp members 192, 194.
[00178]    In Fig. 1 IB, the flexible member 196 has a first end 196a which is fixed to the second clamp
member 194 adjacent the proximal end 194b thereof and passes through the second clamp member
194 adjacent the proximal end 194b thereof. The flexible member 196 then passes through the first
clamp member 194 adjacent a proximal end 192b thereof, through the first clamp member 192, out of
the first clamp member 192 adjacent the distal end 192a thereof, into the second clamp member 194
adjacent the distal end 194a thereof, through the second clamp member 194, and out the proximal end
194b of clamp member 194. The second end 196b of the flexible member 196 may be positioned
outside the body and pulled or otherwise manipulated by the surgeon so as to increase the tension in
the flexible member 196, and thereby generate a clamping force between the clamp members 192,
194.    In Fig. 1 IC, the flexible member 196 is fixed to the second clamp member 194 adjacent a
proximal end 194b thereof and extends along the length of the second clamp member 194 toward the
distal end 194a. The flexible member 196 passes out of the second clamp member 194 adjacent the
distal end 194a thereof and passes into the first clamp member 192 adjacent the distal end 192a
thereof. The flexible member 196 extends along the length of the first clamp member 192 and out of
the first clamp member 192 adjacent the proximal end 192b thereof. The flexible member 196 then
passes back into the second clamp member 194 adjacent the proximal end 194b thereof and out the
proximal end 194b of second clamp member 194. The second end 194b may be positioned outside
the body and pulled or otherwise manipulated by the surgeon so as to increase the tension in the
flexible member 196, and thereby generate a clamping force between the clamp members 192, 194.
[00179]    In alternative embodiments, there may be more than one flexible member used to tension
the two clamp members so as to generate a clamping force therebetween. In this regard, Figs. 1 ID
11 E are schematic illustrations of exemplary configurations of two clamp members 192, 194 and two
flexible members 196, 198 configured to be tensioned so as provide a clamping force between the
clamp members 192, 194. In Fig. 1ID, a first flexible member 196 has a first end 196a fixed to the
first clamp member 192 adjacent the distal end 192a thereof and passes out of the first clamp member
192 adjacent the distal end 192a thereof. The first flexible member 196 then passes into the second
clamp member 194 adjacent a distal end 194a thereof and extends along the second clamp member
194 and out of the proximal end 194b thereof. The second end 194b of the first flexible member 196

 WO 2015/095333                                                                   PCT/US2014/070869
may be positioned outside the body. The arrangement further includes a second flexible member 198
having a first end 198a fixed to the first clamp member 192 adjacent the proximal end 192b thereof
and passes out of the first clamp member 192 adjacent the proximal end 192b thereof. The second
flexible member 198 then passes into the second clamp member 194 adjacent a proximal end 194b
thereof and passes out of the proximal end 194b thereof. The second end 198b of the second flexible
member 198 may be positioned outside the body.
[00180]    With this arrangement, the second ends 196b, 198b may be pulled or otherwise manipulated
by the surgeon so as to increase the tension in the flexible members 196, 198 and thereby generate a
clamping force between the clamp members 192, 194.                   In one aspect, this arrangement
advantageously provides for independent control of the clamping force of the proximal and the distal
ends of the resection line guide. In this regard, increasing the tension in the first flexible member 196
will draw the distal ends 192a, 194a of clamp members 192, 194 towards each other. As the distance
between the distal ends 192a, 194a decreases, the clamping force at the distal end of the resection line
guide increases. In a similar manner, increasing the tension in the second flexible member 198 will
draw the proximal ends 192b, 194b of clamp members 192, 194 towards each other. As the distance
between the proximal ends 192b, 194b decreases, the clamping force at the proximal end of the
resection line guide increases.      Fig. 11E illustrates the resection line guide according to the
embodiment in Fig. 1ID where the distance between the distal ends 192a, 194a of the clamp members
192, 194 is less than the distance between the proximal ends 192b, 194b creating an overall shape of
the resection line guide that is generally trapezoidal. In other words, the clamp members 192, 194
may be in non-parallel relation. Consequently, the clamping force at the distal end of the resection
line guide may be greater than the clamping force at the proximal end of the resection line guide when
the resection line guide is placed around an anatomical structure. This ability to independently control
the clamping force along the proximal and distal ends of the resection line guide may be advantageous
in certain applications. For instance, independently controlling the clamping force along the proximal
and distal ends of the resection line guide may be advantageous where the tissue thickness of the
anatomical structure varies along the length of the resection line. By way of example, the distal end
14 of the stomach 10 generally has a thickness less than that of the proximal end 16 of the stomach 10.
Accordingly, the ranges of clamping force used in the two-stage clamping process, as described
above, may vary at the distal and proximal ends 14, 16 of the stomach 10. Using a resection line
guide capable of providing a varying clamping force along the length of, for example, the stomach 10
may aid in creating an improved resection line.
[00181]    In reference to Fig. IE, a first flexible member 196 is coupled to first and second clamp
members 192, 194 in a manner similar to that described above for resection line guides 80, 94.
                                                    41

 WO 2015/095333                                                                   PCT/US2014/070869
However, this embodiment further includes a second flexible member 198 coupled to the first and
second clamp members 192, 194 in a manner similar to that described above for guides 80, 94.
Notably, the first flexible member 196 extends through the first and second clamp members 192, 194
adjacent a first edge 200 thereof and the second flexible member 198 extends through the first and
second clamp members 192, 194 adjacent a second edge 202 thereof.                      This arrangement
advantageously provides for independent control of the right and the left sides of the resection line
guide.    In this regard, increasing the tension in the first flexible member 196 will increase the
clamping force at the left side of the resection line guide. In a similar manner, increasing the tension
in the second flexible member 198 will increase the clamping force at the right side of the resection
line guide. This ability to control the clamping force along the right and left sides of the resection line
guide may be advantageous in certain applications.
[00182]     In addition to the above, while the length of the clamp members have been described as
generally exceeding the length of the anatomical structure being clamped (e.g., stomach, lung, kidney,
liver, etc.), the invention is not so limited. More particularly, the lengths of the clamping members
may vary depending on the specific application to be greater or less than the length of the anatomical
structure being clamped. Additionally, the first and second clamp members do not have to be of equal
lengths, but may have different lengths. In exemplary embodiments, the two clamp members may be
formed from plastic, metal, or other materials suitable for providing a clamping force in a biological
environment (i.e., must be biologically compatible).         The clamp members may be configured to
distribute the clamping force provided to the anatomical structure across the length of the clamp
members. The clamp members may be generally rigid. As noted above, the clamp members may be
hollow, solid, partially hollow, or have other configurations. In the embodiments discussed herein,
the two clamp members are illustrated as elongate members having a certain cross-section. However,
the clamp members may have a variety of cross-sectional shapes, some of which are illustrated in
Figs. 12A-12E. By way of example, the two clamp members 204, 206 may have cross-sectional
shapes that are rectangular (Fig. 12A), cylindrical (Fig. 12B), V-shaped (Fig. 12C), half-moon (Fig.
12D-E), or wavy (Fig. 12G). The two clamp members 204, 206 may have the same or different cross
sectional shapes. For example, Fig. 12F illustrates an embodiment where the clamp member 204 may
have a crescent cross-sectional shape, while the clamp member 206 may have a half-moon cross
sectional shape. As previously noted above, the two clamp members may be formed as a unitary
member or may be formed from a plurality of clamp segments as previously described.
[00183]     In addition to the above, the surfaces of the clamp members that engage with the anatomical
structure may be textured to enhance the securement of the resection line guide to the anatomical
structure. For example, these surfaces may include a traction pattern that facilitates the resistance of
                                                      42

 WO 2015/095333                                                                    PCT/US2014/070869
movement of the resection line guide relative to the underlying tissue. The traction pattern may be
formed, for example, by ridges and grooves. The ridges and grooves may be directed generally in the
axial direction, the longitudinal direction, or in crisscrossed pattern. The surfaces may be roughened,
for example, with various post-processing methods generally known in the art.               Other textured
patterns may also be possible.
[00184]    Additionally, while the embodiments above show the clamp members as being generally
straight (i.e., so as to produce a generally straight resection line), the invention is not so limited. In
this regard, the two clamp members may have a longitudinal shape other than straight. This may be
beneficial where the surgeon wants to create a non-linear resection line. For example, the surgeon
may want to create a curved resection line that reflects the lesser curvature 28 of the stomach 10. To
accomplish this, Fig. 13A illustrates an alternative embodiment where the two clamp members 208,
210 may be generally arcuate or curved so as to generally correspond to the shape of the lesser
curvature 28 of the stomach 10. In another alternative embodiment, two clamp members 212, 214
may be made of segments connected by a tape 216 or other spine generally running the length of the
two clamp members 212, 214. With the tape 216 on the side of the segments facing anatomical right,
the sides of the segments facing the anatomical left may generally bend and flex outwardly, as
illustrated in Fig. 13B. Further, the segments may be sized based on a staple cartridge. By way of
example, if the segments were between about 50 mm and about 60 mm in length, a curved resection
line may be made by using one 60 mm staple cartridge per segment.               In yet another alternative
embodiment, the two clamp members 218, 220 may have a telescopic configuration (e.g., nested
sections), as illustrated in Fig. 13C, such that the length of the two clamp members 218, 220 may be
easily varied to meet the needs of a specific application.       In still another alternative embodiment
illustrated in Fig. 13D, the two clamp members 224, 226 may be configured to be rigid in the
longitudinal direction but malleable in a transverse direction. In this regard, the clamp members 224,
226 may include a series of cut-outs or notches 228 that facilitate flexing or bending of the clamp
members 224, 226 in a generally transverse direction (e.g., left and right in the reference frame of Fig.
13D). Although not shown, the clamp members 224, 226 may include a mechanism allowing for
external control of the transverse movement of the clamp members 224, 226. In this regard, each
clamp member 224, 226 may have one or more control lines coupled to one or more locations along
the clamp members 224, 226 that allow the clamp members to be flexed in a certain manner. For
example, the control lines may include flexible, or rigid, or semi-rigid cables. In an embodiment
where the clamp members 224, 226 include two flexible members according to the arrangement in
Fig. IE, tightening one of the flexible members may cause the clamp members 224, 226 to flex.
[00185]    The device for tensioning the flexible member should provide a sufficient clamping force
                                                     43

 WO 2015/095333                                                                PCT/US2014/070869
for securing the guide onto the anatomical structure. In this regard, the tensioning device should be
configured to implement the two-stage clamping described above. A variety of tensioning devices
may be used to provide a tension in the flexible member in order to secure the resection line guide
onto the anatomical structure. As noted above, for example, a cinch tube can be used in conjunction
with the flexible member and clamp members to generate a tension in the flexible member. In an
alternative embodiment, a tensioning mechanism for tightening the flexible member may include a
tightener having a plunger, where the plunger may be lifted to slide the flexible member through and
may be released to hold the flexible member in place. For example, the tensioning device may be
configured to move over and rest on the clamp members, such as at a proximal end thereof. Holding
the clamp members together in this way may provide increased tension or secure the clamp members
in order to generate the clamping force.
[00186]    In another aspect, certain embodiments of the present invention may provide an indication
of the length of the resection line. In procedures where laparoscopic linear cutter staplers are used,
knowing the length of the resection line may aid the surgeon in planning the number of stapler
applications that will be used to accomplish the resection.       Fig. 13E illustrates an exemplary
embodiment of a clamp member 230 (only one shown) having a series of markings 232 along the
length of a clamp member 230 configured to provide an indication of distance. 'Ihese markings 232
may be used to mark off distance, for example, in centimeters. Alternatively, the markings 232 may
be used to mark off or estimate the number of staple firings that will be needed to resection the
anatomical structure.    In vertical sleeve gastrectomy procedures, staple cartridges of 60 mm are
commonly used.      As a result, markings 232 spaced 60 mm apart may be used along the clamp
member 230. Using these markings, the surgeon may quickly assess how many staple cartridges will
be needed to complete the resection.
[00187]    In yet another aspect, certain embodiments of the present invention may provide an
indication of the distance from the resection line guide to certain anatomical landmarks. Because
anatomical landmarks are typically referred to when establishing the ideal resection line, it may be
beneficial to know, or be able to more accurately estimate, the distance of the resection line guide to
those landmarks. In this regard, a clamp member of a resection line guide may have a fixed and
known width (e.g., 1 cm in width).      Because the resection line is frequently 1 cm away from the
gastroesophageal junction 22, using a 1 cm wide clamp member that rests against the
gastroesophageal junction 22 would assure a proper spacing from this anatomical landmark. As an
alternative example, the clamp member may have markings indicating a specific width.             In an
exemplary embodiment, as illustrated in Fig. 13F, a clamp member 234 may be wider than 1 cm
where a marking 236 may be included along the length of the clamp member 234 indicating a width
                                                   44

 WO 2015/095333                                                                PCT/US2014/070869
of 1 cm, such as from one of the side edges thereof. In another embodiment, the resection line guide
may include an adjustable measuring device capable of providing a physical scale for determining or
estimating distance from the resection line guide. Fig. 13G illustrates an embodiment where a clamp
member 238 includes a measuring arm 240 coupled to the clamp member 238. In one embodiment,
the measuring arm 240 may be movably coupled, e.g., such as pivotally coupled to the clamp member
238.   In one embodiment, the measuring arm 240 may have a known and pre-determined length.
Alternatively, the measuring arm 240 may include markings 246 indicating distance. This would
allow the surgeon to pivot the measuring arm 240 away from the clamp member 238 and use the
measuring arm 240 to determine or estimate the distance from the resection line guide to various
anatomical landmarks. By way of example and without limitation, a pivotable arm may have a length
of about 2 cm to about 6 cm. In one embodiment, the length of the measuring arm 240 may be
variable. More than one of these components may be used the clamp member 238. Additionally, or
in the alternative, the measuring arm may be movable, e.g., slidable, along the length of the clamp
member 238, as is illustrated in Fig. 13G. For example, the measuring arn 240 may slide within a
longitudinal groove in the clamp member 38.          In an alternative embodiment, electronic distance
measurement may be possible. For instance, a reference point may be established on a clamp member
and the other reference point may be associated with a laparoscopic instrument. In this way, as the
instrument moves within the abdomen, electronic feedback may be provided to indicate the distance
between the two reference points.        In this regard, the clamp member and instrument may be
operatively coupled to a controller to provide the distance measurement.
[00188]    Certain embodiments of the present invention may provide an indication of the thickness of
the anatomical structure to be stapled. This may be accomplished using a variety of methods. In a
previously discussed embodiment, a light source is used to indicate the thickness of an anatomical
structure.  In another embodiment, for example, a clamp member 244 may include longitudinal
markings 246 indicating the distance from the lower edge of the clamp member facing the anatomical
structure to be resected. Fig. 13H illustrates three longitudinal markings 246 along a side wall of a
clamp member 244. These markings may be, for example, markings of distance or markings based
on staple leg lengths.     In practice, different staple leg lengths often have corresponding colors
depending on their manufacturer. The markings, and their spacing, may be based on these colors to
indicate what staple size should be used. By way of example, blue, green, and black lines may be
used to indicate staple leg lengths of 3.5 mm, 4.1 mm, and 4.4 mm, respectively. A surgeon may use
the markings as a scale on which to base a determination or estimate of the thickness of the tissue of
the anatomical structure. By way of example, the surgeon may compare the thickness of tissue that
has already been, for example, stapled with the distances indicated by the longitudinal markings. The
                                                    45

 WO 2015/095333                                                                   PCT/US2014/070869
surgeon may then choose a staple leg length for the next application of the stapler based on the
estimate of the tissue thickness at that location along the anatomical structure. As an alternate method
of indicating thickness using a resection line guide with two clamp members connected by a flexible
member, an indicator window may be used showing an indicator bar that moves based on the length
of flexible member between the clamp members. This may be used for a single flexible member or
for two thicknesses based on a flexible member at each of the distal and proximal ends of the
resection line guide. In another embodiment, the resection line guide may be capable of measuring
the distance between clamp members using ultrasound.             Further, in an embodiment where the
resection line guide is capable of providing a varying clamping force along the length of the
anatomical structure, an indication of the distance between the two clamp members at the distal and
proximal ends of the resection line guide may indicate tissue thickness at the distal and proximal ends
14, 16 of the stomach 10.
[00189]    Certain embodiments of the present invention may be capable of measuring the clamping
force provided by the resection line guide. This may be accomplished using any suitable method
known in the art. An embodiment of a resection line guide may include a flexible member and a
strain gauge to measure the amount of strain on the flexible member. In embodiments where the
guide is applying varying pressure on the anatomical structure, there may be more than one device
capable of measuring the clamping force. In another embodiment, PVDF piezoelectric film or Mylar
film may be included in the resection line guide.
[00190]    In another aspect of the present invention, and with reference to Figs. 14-18, the surgeon
may operate one of the guides above, including one or both clamp members, during a gastrectomy
procedure, for example, with another mechanical device that is coupled to the guide. To that end and
in one embodiment, a medical device 400 includes a resection line guide 402, which may be one of
the guides described above, operatively coupled to a manipulator 404. As shown, the manipulator
404 includes an elongate member or shaft 408 coupled to a handpiece, such as a pistol-grip device
406, at one end and the resection line guide 402 at the other end thereof. As will be described below,
during a surgical procedure, the resection line guide 402 and a portion of the shaft 408 may be
inserted into the patient, such as via a trocar. The surgeon may then manipulate the resection line
guide 402 and/or articulate the resection line guide 402 relative to the manipulator 404 to perform the
procedure. Thus, embodiments of the present invention may include mechanisms for effectuating a
surgical procedure with the resection line guide 402 and for allowing the resection line guide 402 to
articulate relative to the shaft 408.
[00191]    With reference to Figs. 14-18, the resection line guide 402 includes clamp members 412,
414 that are movably coupled together via a flexible member 416. The flexible member 416 passes
                                                     46

 WO 2015/095333                                                                  PCT/US2014/070869
through hollow portions of the clamp members 412, 414 so that, for example, the clamp member 412
may be separated from or brought closer to the clamp member 414. In this regard, an anchor 417
fixes a first end of the flexible member 416 to the clamp member 414 adjacent a proximal end thereof,
and the flexible member 416 passes out of a bore adjacent a proximal end of the clamp member 414
into the clamp member 412 adjacent a proximal end thereof. Flexible member 416 passes through
and out of the clamp member 412 adjacent a distal end thereof. Flexible member 416 then passes into
the clamp member 414 adjacent a distal end thereof and through the clamp member 414 into the shaft
408. Retraction of the flexible member 416 moves at least one of the clamp members 412, 414 as is
shown generally by arrow 418 in Figs. 15A and 16 and described below. The clamp members 412,
414 may have mating surfaces, as shown in Figs. 23B, 24B, and 29. In the present embodiment, the
mating surfaces are illustrated as the ridged surfaces on the clamp members 412, 414. The ridged
surface on the clamp member 412 is capable of mating with the ridged surface on the clamp member
414 in multiple locations. This effectively allows for rotation of the resection line guide 402 about an
axis parallel to the clamp members 412, 414. When the resection line guide 402 is rotated about an
axis parallel to the clamp members 412, 414, the flexible member 416 may exit the proximal end of
the clamp member 414 at an angle, as is shown in Fig. 29. To reduce stress on the flexible member
416 if this happens, the bore 413 (labeled in Fig. 27B) adjacent a proximal end of the clamp member
414 creates an arcuate path for the flexible member 416 on the side of the clamp member 414 facing
the clamp member 412. This arcuate path allows the flexible member 416 to more gradually angle
towards the proximal end of the clamp member 412. The resection line guide 402 may include other
bores similar to the bore 413 on one or both of the proximal and distal ends of one or both of the
clamp members 412, 414.
[00192]    The resection line guide 402 may include a tab 410, which extends from the clamp member
412 by which the surgeon may manipulate the orientation of the resection line guide 402. It will be
appreciated that a tab may also be mounted on the clamp member 414. This may allow for more
controlled separation of the clamp members 412, 414. Alternatively, instead of a tab on one or both of
the clamp members 412, 414, another element capable of being engaged by a laparoscopic instrument
may extend from or be mounted to one or both of the clamp members 412, 414. By way of example,
a flexible cable or a coupling area may be attached or formed in one of the clamp members 412, 414
with which a laparoscopic instrument may engage. By way of further example, a coupling area may
include a magnet or may be a recess in which a laparoscopic instrument may be configured to clip or
snap. The resection line guide 402 may include one of the exemplary resection line guides described
above, such as, for example, those shown in Figs. 3E, 4B, and 5A.            To at least those ends, the
manipulator 404 includes mechanisms that the surgeon may manipulate to independently move the
                                                    47

 WO 2015/095333                                                                  PCT/US2014/070869
resection line guide 402 to open and close the clamp members 412, 414 and/or to pivot the resection
line guide 402 relative to the manipulator 404, as is described in detail below.
[00193] With reference to Figs. 14, 15A, 1513, 17A, 1713, and 18, in one embodiment, the
manipulator 404 includes a case or housing formed by halves 420a, 420b that contains mechanisms
for operation of the medical device 400. In this regard, the flexible member 416 extends from shaft
408 and is fixed to a spring reel 422. As is shown in Fig. 18A, the spring reel 422 may include a case
or housing formed by halves 422a, 422b that contains a spiral spring 422c and a spool 422d of the
flexible member 416 onto which the flexible member 416 may be wound and unwound. The spring
reel 422 may have a force constant of 0.1 to 1 lb. The spring reel 422 is therefore configured to
release a length of the flexible member 416 and/or take up a length of the flexible member 416 as is
generally understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.
[00194] According to one aspect of the invention for manipulating the resection line guide 402 to
effectuate treatment, the manipulator 404 includes a brake mechanism 426 that is capable of
frictionally capturing the flexible member 416 to prevent its unintentional movement relative to the
brake mechanism 426, such as unintentional extension of the flexible member 416 from the spring
reel 422. To that end, as is shown in Figs. 17A, 17B, and 18, the brake mechanism 426 includes a
brake lever 428 that is pivotally coupled relative to the housing 420a, 420b (as is indicated by arrow
430) and operatively positioned to clamp the flexible member 416 at one end. The brake lever 428
projects from the housing 420a, 420b so that it may be manipulated by the surgeon.           It will be
appreciated that the surgeon may operate the brake lever 428 with one or more fingers during
operation of the medical device 400 between a disengaged position (Fig. 19) in which the brake
mechanism 426 does not restrict movement of the flexible member 416 and an engaged position
(Figs. 20A and 20B) in which the brake mechanism 426 contacts the flexible member 416.
[00195]    In one embodiment, and with reference to Figs. 17A, 17B, and 18, the brake mechanism
426 further includes a brake arm 434 and a brake plate 436. The brake arm 434 is pivotally coupled
between the housings 420a, 420b and positioned to be engaged by the brake lever 428 when pivoted
according to the arrow 440 as is generally shown at 438 in Fig. 19, the operation of which is described
below. In the embodiment shown, the brake plate 436 is integrally formed in the housing 420a.
However, embodiments of the invention are not limited to integral formation as the brake plate 436
may be separately formed and then secured to one or both housings 420a, 420b via an adhesive, tack
welding, or like means of attachment. The brake plate 436 may have a generally J-shaped cross
section that receives a portion of the brake ann 434 therein when the brake arm 434 is driven by the
movement of the brake lever 428.
[00196]    With reference to Figs. 14, 15A, 1513, 17A, 1713, and 18, the mechanisms operating the

resection line guide 402 may, in addition or alternatively to the brake mechanism 426, include a
clamping mechanism 444 that is capable of applying a force generally crosswise or perpendicular to
the flexible member 416 when the clamping mechanism 444 is engaged. In this way, the clamping
mechanism 444 tensions the flexible member 416. By applying a force to the flexible member 416 in
a crosswise direction, the clamp members 412, 414 (shown in Figs. 15A and 15B) may be moved
toward one another and, as is described below, may apply a clamping force to tissue situated between
the clamp members 412, 414.
[00197]    In one embodiment, the clamping mechanism 444 includes a clamping lever 446 that is
pivotally coupled between housings 420a, 420b. The clamping lever 446 extends from the housings
420a, 420b and may be manipulated by the surgeon to engage the clamping mechanism 444. While
the clamping lever 446 may be independently operated by the surgeon relative to the brake lever 428,
in one embodiment, engaging the brake mechanism 426 may also initiate some slight engagement of
the clamping mechanism 444. For example, the surgeon may independently operate the brake lever
428 and the clamping lever 446 or engagement of the brake mechanism 426 may also engage the
clamping mechanism 444 at a low level. Thus, full depression of the brake lever 428 may cause slight
movement of the clamping lever 446.
[00198]    Portions of the clamping lever 446 pass through portions of the brake mechanism 426 and
are slidably coupled to a clamping bracket 450 that includes a mechanism for limiting the magnitude
of the force placed on the flexible member 416.       In one embodiment, clamping mechanism 444
includes a limiter finger or plate 452 slidably secured to the clamping bracket 450 and operably
coupled to a limiter spring 454. The limiter spring 454 biases the limiter plate 452 in an extended
direction toward the flexible member 416 (best shown in Fig. 19) relative to the clamping bracket 450.
It will be appreciated that the surgeon may operate the clamping lever 446 with one or more fingers
during operation of the medical device 400 between a disengaged position (Fig. 19) in which the
clamping mechanism 444 does not significantly tension the flexible member 416 and an engaged
position (Figs. 21A and 21B) in which the clamping mechanism 444 tensions the flexible member
416 by displacing the flexible member 416 from its original path. In particular, when the clamping
lever 446 is in the engaged position, the limiter plate 452 forcibly contacts the flexible member 416
and deflects the flexible member 416 from its original path. This deflection thereby increases the
tension in the flexible member 416. When engaged with the flexible member 416, the limiter plate
452 may compress the limiter spring 454 and so the limiter spring 454 may limit the maximum force
applied to the flexible member 416 by the clamping mechanism 444.
[00199]    In one embodiment and with reference to Figs. 19, 20A, and 20B, one or both of the brake
mechanism 426 and the clamping mechanism 444 may be biased toward their disengaged positions.
                                                   49

 WO 2015/095333                                                                 PCT/US2014/070869
In this regard, as the surgeon releases one or both of the brake lever 428 and the clamping lever 446,
each of the levers 428, 446 may spontaneously return to their disengaged positions. At this point, the
flexible member 416 may freely extend from the spring reel 422. In one embodiment, a spring 456 is
coupled directly to the clamping lever 446 at one end and is indirectly coupled to the brake lever 428
proximate the clamping lever 446. The spring 456 is coupled to the housing 420a, 420b at the other
end thereof. The spring 456 biases one or both of the brake lever 428 and the clamping lever 446
toward their disengaged positions.      For example, movement of the brake lever 428 and/or the
clamping lever 446 toward the flexible member 416 causes the spring 456 to be extended or biased, as
can be seen by comparison of Figs. 19 and 20A. Release of the brake lever 428 and/or the clamping
lever 446 may allow the spring 456 to return to a less biased or unbiased state and automatically
disengage the respective brake mechanism 426 and/or the clamping mechanism 444.
[00200]    In one embodiment, and with reference to Figs. 14, 15A, 15B, and 17A-19, the housing
420a, 420b may also include a stop and release mechanism 460. The stop and release mechanism 460
may engage either or both of the brake mechanism 426 and the clamping mechanism 444 when one or
both are engaged with the flexible member 416. In this regard and with reference to Figs. 17A, 17B,
and 18, the stop and release mechanism 460 may include a frame 462. A stop block 464 is pivotably
secured to the frame 462 and is held in a stop position by a spring 466 (the stop position is shown best
in Fig. 19).
[00201]    As shown best in Figs. 17A and 17B, the stop and release mechanism 460 may include a
plurality of serrations 468 on the clamping bracket 450 and a plurality of serrations 470 on the brake
lever 428. The stop block 464 may engage the serrations 468 and/or the serrations 470 when the
surgeon manipulates the corresponding lever 428 and 446, as is described below. Once the stop block
464 is engaged with one serration 468 and/or one serration 470, the stop and release mechanism 460
maintains the brake mechanism 426 and/or the clamping mechanism 444 in the engaged position and
thus counteracts the bias of the spring 456. That is, the combination of the stop block 464 and the
serrations 468, 470 operates as a positive stop for the brake mechanism 426 and the clamping
mechanism 444. Having multiple serrations 468, 470 allows the surgeon to independently adjust the
force on the flexible member 416 from the brake mechanism 426 and adjust the force on the flexible
member 416 from the clamping mechanism 444. For example, with reference to Figs. 17A, 17B,
21A, and 21B, while not being limited to any particular quantity, the stop and release mechanism 460
may include at least three positive stop positions for the brake mechanism 426 in view of the three
serrations 470 on the brake lever 428. The stop and release mechanism 460 may include at least five
positive stop positions for the clamping mechanism 444 in view of the five serrations 468 on the
clamping lever 446.

 WO 2015/095333                                                                  PCT/US2014/070869
[00202] Once the desired level force for each of the mechanisms 426, 444 is determined by selection
of the serration 468, 470 with which the stop block 464 engages, the stop and release mechanism 460
allows the surgeon to let go of the levers 446 and 428 while maintaining the mechanisms 426 and/or
444 engaged with the flexible member 416. Advantageously, the stop and release mechanism 460
reduces hand fatigue while maintaining the mechanisms 426 and 444 engaged with the flexible
member 416, because the surgeon is not required to maintain pressure on each of these mechanisms to
maintain engagement with the flexible member 416.
[00203]    In one embodiment, and with reference to Figs. 17A, 17B, and 18, the stop and release
mechanism 460 further includes a release lever 472 that protrudes beyond the housing 420a, 420b
through an opening 474 therein. The surgeon may selectively disengage the stop block 464 by
pressing the release lever 472. In this regard, the surgeon may press on the release lever 472, such as
with a thumb, with a sufficient force to counteract the bias produced by the spring 466. At that
threshold force, the stop block 464 rotates out of contact with the serrations 468, 470 to a release
position (shown best in Fig. 22). The spring 456 then spontaneously acts to disengage each of the
brake mechanism 426 and/or the clamping mechanism 444.
[00204] In an exemplary embodiment, the operation of each of the brake mechanism 426, the
clamping mechanism 444, and the stop and release mechanism 460 will be described in conjunction
with operation of the resection line guide 402 during a surgical procedure. In particular, after the
stomach has been effectively mobilized along its greater curve, the surgeon may manipulate the
medical device 400 to insert the resection line guide 402 and at least a portion of the shaft 408 into the
abdominal cavity through a surgical trocar. The surgeon may separate the clamp members 412, 414,
for example, by grasping the tab 410 with a laparoscopic instrument. Because the first end of the
flexible member 416 is fixed to the anchor 417, separating the clamp members 412, 414 causes the
spring reel 422 to release a length of the flexible member 416, which slides through the clamp
members 412, 414.
[00205] The surgeon may secure the resection line guide 402 in position by manually moving the
clamp member 412 towards the clamp member 414. As the distance between the clamp members
412, 414 decreases, the spring reel 422 takes up any slack in the flexible member 416. When the
spring reel 422 takes up slack in the flexible member 416, the clamp members 412, 414 may generally
vertically align relative to the stomach 10. At this point, the clamp members 412, 414 may begin to
provide a clamping force on the stomach 10. In this regard, the resection line guide 402 provides a
clamping force sufficient to ensure that the clamp members 412, 414 do not migrate after being
positioned.
[00206] With reference to Figs. 19-24B, following insertion of the medical device 400 and
                                                    51

 WO 2015/095333                                                                  PCT/US2014/070869
positioning of the resection line guide 402 around tissue, such as the stomach 10 (shown in Figs. 23A,
23B, 24A, and 24B), the surgeon may initially activate the brake mechanism 426. To do so, the
surgeon grasps the housing 420a, 420b and squeezes the brake lever 428 toward the pistol grip as is
indicated by arrow 440 in Fig. 19. As the surgeon squeezes the brake lever 428, the brake arm 434
rotates toward the brake plate 436, as indicated by the arrow 476. In a predetermined orientation of
the brake lever 428, and with reference to Figs. 20A and 20B, the brake arm 434 engages the flexible
member 416 and captures it between the brake arm 434 and the brake plate 436. The engagement of
the brake mechanism 426 may cause a slight retraction of the flexible member 416 and a
correspondingly small movement of the clamp member 412 toward the clamp member 414. It will be
appreciated that in this orientation of the brake lever 428, the stop block 464 may engage one serration
470 to provide a positive stop to the brake mechanism 426. As such, should the surgeon let go of the
brake lever 428, the spring 456 (even though in an extended or biased condition) is unable to
overcome the positive stop of the stop and release mechanism 460 and so the brake mechanism 426
remains frictionally engaged with the flexible member 416. In this position, the flexible member 416
may not move or slide in either direction between the brake arm 434 and the brake plate 436. Even
though the brake mechanism 426 is engaged, the clamp members 412 and 414 may be separated by
the stomach 10 (shown in phantom line in Figs. 23A and 23B). The brake mechanism 426 may be
engaged at other points during the medical procedure. By way of example, the surgeon may engage
the brake mechanism 426 after separating the clamp members 412, 414 when positioning the
resection line guide 402 around the stomach 10. This would allow the surgeon to manipulate the
clamp members 412, 414 without the force from the spring reel 422 acting on the flexible member
416.
[00207]    The securement of the resection line guide 402 to the stomach 10 may be achieved using the
two-stage clamping process as described above. More particularly, the flexible member 416 may be
pulled so as to generate a clamping force on the stomach 10 less than the threshold clamping force.
Again, this first-stage clamping force is configured and selected to provide a certain amount of
resistance to movement of the resection line guide 402 relative to the stomach 10. This resistance is
configured to prevent undesirable or unintentional movements of the resection line guide 402, but yet
permit the surgeon to move the resection line guide 402 to a desired position relative to the stomach
10 without significant difficulty. This may be achieved in this embodiment when the spring reel 422
takes up the slack in the flexible member 416 and the brake mechanism 426 is engaged. In the second
clamping stage, and with the resection line guide 402 in the desired location relative to the stomach
10, the clamping force of the resection line guide 402 may be increased above the threshold clamping
force to effectively prevent or minimize the resection line guide 402 from moving relative to the
                                                     52

 WO 2015/095333                                                                  PCT/US2014/070869
stomach 10. The upper limit to which the resection line guide 402 may be clamped is selected so as to
avoid any damage to the underlying tissue being clamped. This may be achieved in this embodiment
by engaging the clamping mechanism 444, as described below.
[00208] With reference now to Figs. 20A, 20B, 21A, and 21B, following engagement of the brake
mechanism 426, if additional tension on the flexible member 416 is desired, the surgeon may engage
the clamping mechanism 444.       To do so, the surgeon may squeeze the clamping lever 446 in the
direction of the arrow 478 or toward the pistol grip. Movement of the clamping lever 446 rotates the
clamping bracket 450 so that the limiter plate 452 rotates into contact with the flexible member 416 as
is indicated by arrow 480 in Fig. 20. Because the limiter plate 452 only just begins to contact the
flexible member 416, as shown in Figs. 20A and 20B, there may be only limited retraction of the
flexible member 416 from the resection line guide 402 and so the clamp member 412 as shown in Fig.
23A may not move.
[00209]    With reference to Figs. 21A, 21B, 23A, and 23B, movement of the clamp member 412
toward the clamp member 414 as is indicated by arrow 482 may be achieved if the surgeon continues
to squeeze the clamping lever 446 toward the pistol grip as indicated by arrow 478 in Figs. 21A and
21B. As shown, squeezing the clamping lever 446 rotates the limiter plate 452 into contact with the
flexible member 416 and causes the flexible member 416 to be displaced from its original path.
Because the brake mechanism 426 is engaged, the flexible member 416 may not be pulled from the
spring reel 422.
[00210]    Instead, and with reference to Figs. 21A, 21B, 24A, and 24B, the flexible member 416 is
retracted from the resection line guide 402 as is indicated by arrows 482. Accordingly, squeezing the
clamping lever 446 into the position shown in Figs. 21A and 21B may cause the clamp member 412
to forcibly move toward the clamp member 414 and provide a clamping force on the stomach 10
therebetween. The surgeon may adjust the tension on the flexible member 416, and therefore adjust
the clamping force on the stomach 10, by further squeezing the clamping lever 446. As described
above, the clamping mechanism 444 limits the maximum clamping force of the resection line guide
402 on the stomach 10. Accordingly, and with continued reference to Figs. 21A and 21B, further
squeezing of the clamping lever 446, at some predetermined point, produces a maximum clamping
force on the stomach 10 beyond which further movement of the clamping lever 446 produces little, if
any, increase in tension on the flexible member 416. That is, once the maximum tension on the
flexible member 416 is achieved, further squeezing of the clamping lever 446 produces little, if any,
deflection of the flexible member 416 by the limiter plate 452. The limiter plate 452 and the limiter
spring 454 in combination with the rotational stroke of the clamping lever 446 prevent excessive
tension on the flexible member 416 and so prevent damaging the stomach 10 during the procedure.

 WO 2015/095333                                                                    PCT/US2014/070869
[00211] With reference now to Figs. 21A and 21B, squeezing the clamping lever 446 further extends
the spring 456 and rotates the clamping bracket 450 into a position in which a serration 468 engages
the stop block 464. Under the bias produced by the spring 466, the stop block 464 in contact with the
serration 468 forms a positive stop of the clamping mechanism 444. Should the surgeon let go of the
clamping lever 446, the stop and release mechanism 460 prevents the bias in the spring 456 from
releasing the clamping mechanism 444. Any tension on the flexible member 416 produced by the
clamping mechanism 444 is thereby maintained by the stop and release mechanism 460 and
specifically by the positive stop produced between the stop block 464 and one serration 468. Further
rotation of the clamping bracket 450, such as when the surgeon increases the clamping force, further
engages the stop block 464 with successive serrations 468. Successively higher clamping forces on
the stomach 10 are thereby maintained should the surgeon let go of the clamping lever 446.
[00212] When the resection line guide 402 is placed on the stomach 10 (e.g., in the first clamping
stage as described above), the surgeon has a clear visualization of the intended results of the vertical
sleeve gastrectomy prior to actually performing the resection of the stomach 10 at the resection line
12. Hence, the surgeon has an indication of what the resultant stomach volume defined by the lesser
curvature 28 and the resection line 12 will be prior to cutting tissue. If the surgeon is not satisfied with
the indication of the expected stomach volume, the surgeon may adjust and manipulate the location
and alignment of the resection line guide 402 prior to stapling and cutting the stomach 10. Once the
resection line guide 402 is finally positioned (e.g., the second clamping stage as described above), the
surgeon may then cut and staple the tissue using the resection line guide 402 as a track along the entire
segment or a significant part of the segment until complete resection of the stomach 10 occurs. In this
regard, a stapling device may abut or engage the resection line guide 402 along an alignment surface
to facilitate an improved resection line, similar to that shown above in Fig. 2D.
[00213] With reference to Fig. 22 and after the resection of stomach 10, each of the brake
mechanism 426 and the clamping mechanism 444 may be released. In this regard, the surgeon may
press the release lever 472.      As described above, sufficient pressure on the release lever 472
overcomes the bias of the spring 466 and rotates the stop block 464 out of engagement with serrations
468, 470. Once the stop block 464 clears the serrations 468, 470, the spring 456 that was extended
when the surgeon squeezed the levers 428 and 446 disengages the brake mechanism 426 and the
clamping mechanism 444. The spring 456 moves each of the mechanisms according to arrows 484.
As a result, the limiter plate 452 rotates away from contact with the flexible member 416. Similarly,
the brake arm 434 rotates away from the flexible member 416 and out of engagement with the brake
plate 436. Once each of the mechanisms 426 and 444 is released, a length of the flexible member 416
may be freed from the spring reel 422 and the clamp member 412 may be separated from the clamp
                                                      54

 WO 2015/095333                                                                   PCT/US2014/070869
member 414 to release the stomach 10. This movement may be the reverse of the movement of the
clamp member 412 during clamping of the stomach 10. It will be appreciated that moving the clamp
member 412 away from the clamp member 414 may be achieved by pulling on the tab 410 with a
laparoscopic instrument.
[00214] With reference to Figs. 14 and 25-29, in one embodiment, the medical device 400 includes a
joint 488 movably coupling the shaft 408 to the resection line guide 402. The joint 488 allows the
shaft 408 to articulate relative to the resection line guide 402. In addition to articulating, the joint 488
is lockable so that once the resection line guide 402 is properly positioned, it may be fixed in relative
orientation to the shaft 408. To do so, in one embodiment, the manipulator 404 includes a mechanism
for locking and unlocking the joint 488. The surgeon may therefore rotate and position the resection
line guide 402 at any time during the procedure during which the resection line guide 402 is located in
the patient and then lock the resection line guide 402 relative to the shaft 408 without having direct
access to the joint itself.
[00215]    To these and other ends, as shown in Fig. 25, in one embodiment, the shaft 408 includes a
tubular housing 490 that encloses a cable guide 492 and a lever guide 494. As shown, the cable guide
492 and lever guide 494 each have semi-circular cross-sections that when assembled fill the tubular
housing 490 and enhance the rigidity of the shaft 408. The cable guide 492 defines a channel 496 that
extends axially and is open to each end of the cable guide 492. When the cable and lever guides 492,
494 are assembled within the housing 490, the channel 496 defines a passage that is open to each end
of the shaft 408. The channel 496 receives the flexible member 416. The cable guide 492 may have a
plurality of fins and corresponding trenches or grooves 510 formed at or near the location of the joint
488. This configuration may provide some flexibility in the shaft 408 at or near the joint 488.
[00216]    With continued reference to Fig. 25, the lever guide 494 defines a slot 498 that extends
axially along a circumferential surface of the lever guide 494. As shown, the length of the slot 498
may be less than the full length of the lever guide 494. The slot 498 may be open to only one end of
the lever guide 494 and, although not shown in Fig. 25, the slot 498 opens to a bore 500 (shown in
Fig. 28) at the other end of the lever guide 494. The slot 498 receives an elongated member or release
lever 502 having a through-hole 504 at one end and a cutout 506 at the other end thereof. The cutout
506 defines a tab 508 at one end of the release lever 502. When the release lever 502 is received in
the slot 498, the tab 508 aligns with the bore 500. The through-hole 504 is exposed at one end of the
shaft 408 and is configured to cooperate with a locking/unlocking mechanism on the pistol-grip
device 406, described below.         The lever guide 494 may include a tongue-like projection 512
extending along the longitudinal axis of the lever guide 494. The tongue 512 may define a cutout 514
between the cable guide 492 and lever guide 494 when they are assembled. The cutout 514 movably

 WO 2015/095333                                                                  PCT/US2014/070869
receives a portion of the resection line guide 402, described below. As shown in Fig. 28, a post 516
extends substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the lever guide 494 and provides a point
around which the shaft 408 and the resection line guide 402 pivot relative to one another, as is
indicated by the arrows 518 in Fig. 28. In one embodiment, the lever guide 494 includes a notch 554
that cooperates with a pair of bendable tabs 556 in the housing 490. The housing 490 includes a
window 558 which cooperates with a release mechanism coupled to the pistol-grip device 406
described below.
[00217]    With continued reference to Figs. 25, 27A, 27B, and 28, in one embodiment, the cable and
lever guides 492, 494 house a locking mechanism 540 that may include a locking pin 542 and a
locking spring 544. The locking pin 542 is a generally rectangular body having a tip 546 extending
from one end and a slot 548 formed in one surface. As shown, the locking spring 544 cooperates with
the end of the locking pin 542 opposite the tip 546 and so extends generally coincident with the axis
of the locking pin 542. The locking pin 542 and the locking spring 544 may be movably contained
within the bore 500. The locking spring 544 cooperates with the bore 500 to bias the locking pin 542
in the direction of the resection line guide 402. The slot 548 of the locking pin 542 receives the tab
508 of the release lever 502 when the locking mechanism 540 is positioned in the bore 500 and the
release lever 502 is placed in the slot 498. 'ihe tip 546 of the locking pin 542 extends into the cutout
514 and interacts with a portion of the resection line guide 402, described below.
[00218]    With continued reference to Figs. 25, 27A, and 27B, in one embodiment, the clamp member
414 includes a tongue 520. A bore 522 extends through the tongue 520 generally perpendicularly to
the longitudinal axis of the resection line guide 402.     A plurality of gear-like teeth 528 generally
define an arcuate-shaped end 526 of the tongue 520. With reference to Figs. 25 and 28, in one
embodiment, the joint 488 includes a centering spring 560. As shown, the centering spring 560
extends across the joint 488 into recesses in each of the shaft 408 and the clamp member 414 and is
configured to elastically bend as loads that may be applied by the surgeon. As described below, the
centering spring 560 resists relative movement between the shaft 408 and the resection line guide 402.
[00219]    When the joint 488 is assembled, the cutout 514 of the shaft 408 receives the tongue 520 of
the clamp member 414 with the post 516 residing in the bore 522. The tip 546 on the locking pin 542
cooperates with the teeth 528 on the tongue 520 of the resection line guide 402. By this arrangement
as shown in Fig. 27B, the resection line guide 402 and the shaft 408 may not move relative to one
another and are locked in position.      It will be appreciated that the locking spring 544 biases the
locking pin 542, specifically the tip 546, into the teeth 528 (best shown in Fig. 27B). As such, the
locking mechanism 540 provides a normally-locked configuration. That is, only when the locking pin
542 is retracted against the bias of the locking spring 544 to clear the teeth 528 is the shaft 408
                                                    56

 WO 2015/095333                                                                    PCT/US2014/070869
pivotable relative to the resection line guide 402.
[00220] In this regard and with reference to Figs. 27A, 27B, and 28, the release lever 502 cooperates
with the locking pin 542. Specifically, the tab 508 cooperates with the slot 548. Sliding movement of
the release lever 502 in the direction of the arrow 552 in Fig. 28 counteracts the bias in the spring 544
and so slides the locking pin 542 within the bore 500 to compress the locking spring 544. The tip 546
is withdrawn from cooperation with the teeth 528 such that the joint 488 is unlocked. The resection
line guide 402 may then be pivoted relative to the shaft 408 about the post 516 as is illustrated by way
of comparison in Figs. 27A and 27B with movement indicated by arrows 550.
[00221]    In one embodiment, this pivoting action of the resection line guide 402 relative to the shaft
408 must be accompanied by a sufficient level force to bend the centering spring 560. In addition,
once the resection line guide 402 is brought into position in which the centering spring 560 is flexed
or biased, the locking mechanism 460 must be activated to lock in the nonlinear orientation against the
bias produced by the centering spring 560. In the absence the locking mechanism 460 to lock-in the
relative positions of the resection line guide 402 and the shaft 408, the bias in the centering spring 560
will return the resection line guide 402 and the shaft 408 into a linear orientation in which the
centering spring 560 is unbiased. Further in this regard, the linear orientation between the resection
line guide 402 and the shaft 408 may be obtained by releasing the locking mechanism 460 in the
absence of any forces on either of the resection line guide 402 or the shaft 408, the centering spring
560 tending to linearly re-orient the resection line guide 402 and the shaft 408.
[00222] In one embodiment and with reference to Figs. 14, 15A, 15B, 18, and 26, as described
above, the manipulator 404 includes a mechanism by which the surgeon may control the articulation
of the resection line guide 402 relative to the shaft 408. To that end, the manipulator 404 may include
a release mechanism 570 coupled to the release lever 502 (shown in Fig. 26). The release mechanism
570 remains exposed during a procedure so that the surgeon may lock and unlock the joint 488. In
one embodiment, as shown in Fig. 26, the release mechanism 570 includes a shroud 572 having a
plurality of tabs 574 extending radially therefrom. The housing 420a, 420b slidably receives the
shroud 572 at the junction of the shaft 408 with the pistol-grip device 406. The shroud 572 is coupled
with a sleeve 576 that generally corresponds to the outer diameter of the tubular housing 490.
[00223]     With reference to Figs. 17A, 17B and 18, the sleeve 576 includes a flange 578 extending
generally radially therefrom. The release mechanism 570 further includes a coil spring 580 between
the flange 578 and the housing 420a, 420b. The sleeve 576 further includes a pin 584 (shown in Fig.
26) that is coupled to the release lever 502, for example, via the bore 504.
[00224] As shown in Fig. 26, during an operation, the surgeon may decide to rotate the resection line
guide 402 relative to the shaft 408 at the joint 488. To do so, the surgeon may pull the shroud 572 by
                                                     57

 WO 2015/095333                                                                 PCT/US2014/070869
the tabs 574 in the direction indicated by arrow 582 with a sufficient amount of force to compress the
spring 580. By this movement, the sleeve 576 pulls the release lever 502 in the direction indicated by
arrow 582.
[00225] With reference to Fig. 25, as is described above, movement of the release lever 502 in this
direction compresses the spring 544 and moves the locking pin 542 out of engagement with the teeth
528.   Accordingly, movement of the shroud 572 unlocks the joint 488.           The surgeon may then
reposition the resection line guide 402 as necessary. Once repositioned, the surgeon may release the
shroud 572. As a result, the coil spring 580 expands causing the release lever 502 and consequently
the locking pin 542 to return to its locked position. In this manner, the surgeon may remotely lock
and unlock the joint 488 during a procedure to reposition the resection line guide 402 relative to the
shaft 408. It will be appreciated that the coil spring 580, like the locking spring 544, provides a
normally-locked condition of the locking mechanism 540 proximate the joint 488.               It will be
appreciated that when the surgeon pivots the resection line guide 402 relative to the shaft 408, the path
length for the flexible member 416 increases. In this case, the spring reel 422 may release a length of
the flexible member 416 to compensate for the longer path length. If the spring reel 422 is prevented
from releasing an additional length of the flexible member 416, for example, if the brake mechanism
426 is engaged, the distance between clamp members 412, 414 may decrease.
[00226]    In another embodiment and with reference now to Figs. 30-34B, a medical device 600
performs substantially the same procedure as the medical device 400 described above. To that end,
the medical device 600 includes a resection line guide 602, which may be one of the guides described
above, operatively coupled to a manipulator 604.         As shown, the manipulator 604 includes an
elongate member or shaft 608 coupled to a handpiece, such as a pistol-grip device 606, at one end and
the resection line guide 602 at the other end thereof. As described above with respect to the medical
device 400, during a surgical procedure, the resection line guide 602 and a portion of the shaft 608
may be inserted into the patient, such as via a surgical trocar. The surgeon may then manipulate the
resection line guide 602 and/or articulate the resection line guide 602 relative to the manipulator 604
to perform the procedure. Thus, embodiments of the present invention may include mechanisms for
allowing the resection line guide 602 to articulate relative to the shaft 608 and for effectuating a
surgical procedure with the resection line guide 602.
[00227]    With reference to Figs. 30, 33D, and 34C, the resection line guide 602 includes clamp
members 612, 614 that are movably coupled together via a flexible member 616. The flexible
member 616 passes through hollow portions of the clamp members 612, 614 so that, for example, the
clamp member 612 may be separated from or brought closer to the clamp member 614. In this
regard, an anchor 617 fixes a first end of the flexible member 616 to the clamp member 614 adjacent
                                                    58

 WO 2015/095333                                                                  PCT/US2014/070869
a distal end thereof. Flexible member 616 passes into the clamp member 612 adjacent a distal end
thereto and out of the clamp member 612 adjacent a proximal end thereto. Flexible member 616 then
passes into the clamp member 614 adjacent a proximal end thereto and into the shaft 608. Retraction
of the flexible member 616 moves at least one of the clamp members 612, 614 as is shown generally
by arrow 618 in Fig. 34C and described below. The resection line guide 602 may include one of the
exemplary resection line guides described above, such as, for example, those shown in Figs. 3E, 4B,
and 5A. To at least those ends, the manipulator 604 includes mechanisms that the surgeon may
manipulate to independently move the resection line guide 602 to open and close the clamp members
612, 614 and/or to pivot the resection line guide 602 relative to the manipulator 604, as is described in
detail below.
[00228]    With reference to Figs. 31, 32A, and 32B, in one embodiment, the manipulator 604 includes
a case or housing formed by halves 620a, 620b that contains mechanisms for operation of the medical
device 600. The flexible member 616 extends from shaft 608 and is fixed to a spring reel 622 (shown
best in Fig. 32A), which may contain a spool of the flexible member 616 onto which the flexible
member 616 may be wound and unwound. The spring reel 622 may be similar to the spring reel 422
shown in Fig. 18A.     The spring reel 622 is contained within the housing 620a, 602b and releases
and/or retracts a length of the flexible member 616. For example, the spring reel 622 may simply
keep the flexible member 616 taut during the procedure. In other words, any slack in the flexible
member 616 may be spontaneously taken up by the spring reel 622.
[00229]    With reference to Figs. 30 and 32C, in one embodiment, the medical device 600 includes a
joint 624 movably coupling the shaft 608 to the resection line guide 602. As shown, the joint 624
may be a ball-and-socket type joint. The joint 624 allows the shaft 608 to articulate relative to the
resection line guide 602 (exemplary motion is shown in phantom line in Fig. 32C). The joint 624 is
lockable so that, once the resection line guide 602 is properly positioned, the resection line guide 602
may be fixed in relative orientation to the shaft 608. To do so, in one embodiment, the manipulator
604 includes a mechanism for locking and unlocking the joint 624. The surgeon may therefore rotate
and position the resection line guide 602 at any time during which the resection line guide 602 is
located in the patient and then lock the resection line guide 602 relative to the shaft 608 without
having direct access to the joint 624.
[00230]    To these and other ends, as shown in Figs. 30-32C, in one embodiment, the shaft 608
includes a guide tube 626 that encloses an inner guide tube 627 having a socket 628. The socket 628
forms one portion of the ball-and-socket joint 624 and pivotally captures a ball 630 that forms another
portion of the ball-and-socket joint 624. The ball 630 may extend from the clamp member 614. As
shown in Figs. 32A, 32B, and 33C, the inner guide tube 627 defines a longitudinally extending bore
                                                   59

 WO 2015/095333                                                                 PCT/US2014/070869
632 through the shaft 608 through which the flexible member 616 passes. Similarly, the ball 630
defines a bore 634. The flexible member 616 passes through the bore 632 and through the joint 624
via the bore 634 in the ball 630.
[00231]    In one embodiment and with reference to Figs. 31, 32A, and 32B, the pistol-grip device 606
includes a mechanism by which the surgeon may lock the orientation of the resection line guide 602
relative to the shaft 608. That is, the joint 624 may be locked to inhibit unintentional movement
between the resection line guide 602 and the shaft 608. To that end, the manipulator 604 may include
an articulation locking mechanism 640 to lock the joint 624. In one embodiment, the articulation
locking mechanism 640 includes an articulation locking lever 642 that is pivotally mounted within the
housing 620a, 620b and extends therefrom so as to be operable by the surgeon, such as with one or
more fingers.
[00232]    The articulation locking lever 642 includes an actuation arm 644 that transfers load from the
locking lever 642 to the guide tube 626 via a compression bracket 646, which acts as a plunger against
a spring 648. As shown in Figs. 32A and 32B, the compression bracket 646 and spring 648 generally
align with the longitudinal axis of the shaft 608. Once compressed, the pressure from the spring 648
pushes the guide tube 626 axially away from the pistol-grip device 606. The inner guide tube 627
remains stationary during axial movement of the guide tube 626. In other words, the guide tubes 626,
627 move relative to one another. By this movement, the guide tube 626 forcibly engages the socket
628 to lock the ball 630 in position.
[00233]    According to another aspect of the invention and with regard to the mechanisms for
effectuating operation of the clamp members 612, 614, and with reference to Figs. 31, 32A, and 32B,
in one embodiment, the manipulator 604 includes a mechanism for tensioning the flexible member
616 similar to the clamping mechanism 444 shown in Fig. 14 and described above. To that end, the
manipulator 604 may include a clamping mechanism 660 to forcibly retract the flexible member 616
from the resection line guide 602 and thereby forcibly retract the clamp member 612 toward the
clamp member 614. The surgeon may therefore clamp tissue between the clamp members 612, 614
by operating the clamping mechanism 660.
[00234]    As shown, in one embodiment, the clamping mechanism 660 includes a number of
components including a clamping lever 662 that is pivotally mounted within the housing 620a, 620b
proximate the locking lever 642.       As with the locking lever 642, the surgeon may squeeze the
clamping lever 662 during a procedure, as is described below. The clamping lever 662 includes an
actuator arm 664 that transfers the load applied by the surgeon on the clamping lever 662 to a
clamping bracket 666, which is slidably received within the housing 620a, 620b. The clamping
bracket 666 includes a notch 668 which receives the actuator arm 664 as the surgeon squeezes the
                                                    60

 WO 2015/095333                                                                   PCT/US2014/070869
clamping lever 662. The clamping bracket 666 further includes a stud 670 onto which a clamping
spring 672 is mounted.       Translational movement of the clamping bracket 666 compresses the
clamping spring 672 against a lever arm 676. The lever arm 676 is pivotably mounted within the
housing 620a, 620b and is operably coupled to the clamping spring 672 proximate the location at
which the flexible member 616 extends from the inner guide tube 627.
[00235]    A bead 680 (shown in Fig. 32A) is fixedly attached to the flexible member 616 proximate
the lever arm 676. The bead 680 may be a generally enlarged portion of the flexible member 616 or
other enlarged discontinuity that is crimped, for example, on the flexible member 616 by which the
flexible member 616 may be frictionally engaged. While a bead is shown in Fig. 32A, it will be
appreciated that other structures may be securely fastened to the flexible member 616. A bead catcher
682 (shown best in Fig. 34B) is operably coupled to the lever arm 676 and is positioned to frictionally
engage the bead 680 during rotational action of the lever arm 676. The bead catcher 682 translates in
a direction generally away from the resection line guide 602 along a path that is generally coincident
with the axis of the shaft 608 and, in doing so, pulls on or retracts the flexible member 616 from the
resection line guide 602. It will be appreciated that any slack in the flexible member 616 during
retraction from the resection line guide 602 may be taken up by the spring reel 622.
[00236]    In one embodiment, and with reference to Fig. 31, 32A, and 32B, the manipulator 604 may
include a stop and release mechanism 700 by which one or both of the locking mechanism 640 and
the clamping mechanism 660 may be locked in their engaged positions and then later released. To
that end, in one embodiment, the stop and release mechanism 700 includes a release lever 702 (shown
in the form of a button) that projects from the housing 620a, 620b, for example, from a backside of the
pistol-grip device 606. The surgeon may therefore operate the lever 702 with a thumb or a forefinger.
[00237]    As shown in Fig. 32A, the release lever 702 may be pivotally mounted within the housing
620a, 620b and operably coupled to a spring 704 which biases the lever 702 in an outwardly direction
from the pistol-grip device 606. The release lever 702 may include a locking finger 706 that is
positioned proximate each of the compression bracket 646 and the clamping bracket 666. The spring
704 biases the locking finger 706 into engagement with each of the compression bracket 646 and the
clamping bracket 666 during manipulation of one or both of the clamping lever 662 and the locking
lever 642.
[00238]    The stop and release mechanism 700 may further include a first stop 708 on the
compression bracket 646 and a second stop 710 on the clamping bracket 666. The locking finger 706
engages the first stop 708 of the compression bracket 646 as the locking lever 642 is compressed in
the direction of the arrow 650. The locking finger 706 is shown engaged with the first stop 708 in
Figs. 33A and 33B as the locking lever 642 reaches the housing 620a, 620b. The locking finger 706
                                                   61

 WO 2015/095333                                                                  PCT/US2014/070869
engages the second stop 710 of the clamping bracket 666 as the clamping lever 662 is compressed in
the direction of the arrow 684. The locking finger 706 is shown engaged with the second stop 710
(and the first stop 708) in Fig. 34A as the clamping lever 662 reaches a position proximate the locking
lever 642 and the housing 620a, 620b.
[00239]    With continued reference to Fig. 34A, in one embodiment of the stop and release
mechanism 700, a height dimension of the first stop 708 is greater than a height dimension of the
second stop 710. It will be appreciated that this configuration allows the locking mechanism 640 to
engage with the locking finger 706 first and also allows the locking mechanism 640 to remain
engaged with the locking finger 706 even after the clamping mechanism 660 is released. In other
words, gradual depression of the release lever 702 releases the clamping mechanism 660 first and
only after additional depression of the release lever 702 is the locking mechanism 640 released.
When the locking finger 706 is engaged with the stops 708 and 710, the surgeon may let go of each of
the levers 642, 662 and the mechanisms 640, 660 will remain engaged. Advantageously, the stop and
release mechanism 700 may reduce hand fatigue while also allowing the surgeon the freedom to
perform other procedures while the mechanisms 640, 660 remain engaged.
[00240]    With reference now to Figs. 32A-32C and 33D, during a procedure and after insertion of the
medical device 600 into a patient, the surgeon may orient the resection line guide 602 relative to the
shaft 608 as is generally shown by the arrows 641 in Fig. 32C. The surgeon may also orient the
clamp members 612, 614 proximate the stomach 10, as is shown in Fig. 33D. The surgeon may then
fix the joint 624 relative to the shaft 608 by engaging the locking mechanism 640.              It will be
appreciated that orienting the clamp members 612, 614 and fixing the joint 624 may be reversed
and/or may be repeated multiple times until the surgeon is satisfied that the clamp members 612, 614
are properly oriented relative to the stomach 10.
[00241]    Once properly oriented, the surgeon squeezes the locking lever 642 in the direction of the
arrow 650 as shown in Figs. 32A and 32B.            This motion drives the actuation arm 644 into the
compression bracket 646 which in turn compresses the spring 648, as is shown in Figs. 33A and 33B.
With reference to Fig. 33C, the load from the spring 648 drives the guide tube 626 axially in the
direction of the arrow 652 and into the socket 628. The compression force from the guide tube 626 on
the socket 628 causes the socket 628 to compress and frictionally engage the ball 630. The frictional
engagement between the ball 630 and the socket 628 inhibits relative movement of the ball 630 and
thus locks the joint 624. In this manner, the resection line guide 602 is fixed in position relative to the
shaft 608 and resists forces encountered during the procedure that would otherwise change the
orientation of the shaft 608 relative to the resection line guide 602 and move the resection line guide
602 out of the desired position.

 WO 2015/095333                                                                  PCT/US2014/070869
[00242] In one embodiment, compressing the locking lever 642 toward the housing 620a, 620b
pushes the compression bracket 646 in the direction of the shaft 608 to a position in which the locking
finger 706 engages the first stop 708. With reference to Figs. 33A and 33B, when the first stop 708 is
engaged, if the surgeon lets go of the locking lever 642, the stop and release mechanism 700 will
maintain the locking mechanism 640 in its engaged position, and the joint 624 will remain locked.
[00243] The operation the clamping mechanism 660 will be described in conjunction with operation
of the resection line guide 602 during a surgical procedure. After the resection line guide 602 is
position as is described above and the stomach has been effectively mobilized along its greater curve,
the surgeon may separate the clamp members 612, 614, for example, by pulling the clamp member
612 with a laparoscopic instrument. Because the first end of the flexible member 616 is fixed to the
anchor 617, separating the clamp members 612, 614 causes the spring reel 622 to release a length of
the flexible member 616, which slides through the clamp members 612, 614. After positioning the
resection line guide around the stomach 10, the surgeon may secure the resection line guide 602 in
position by manually moving the clamp member 612 towards the clamp member 614. As the distance
between the clamp members 612, 614 decreases, the spring reel 622 takes up any slack in the flexible
member 616. When the spring reel 622 takes up slack in the flexible member 616, the clamp
members 612, 614 may generally vertically align relative to the stomach 10. At this point, the clamp
members 612, 614 may begin to provide a clamping force on the stomach 10.
[00244] The securement of the resection line guide 602 to the stomach 10 may be achieved using the
two-stage clamping process as described above. More particularly, the flexible member 616 may be
pulled so as to generate a clamping force on the stomach 10 less than the threshold clamping force.
Again, this first-stage clamping force is configured and selected to provide a certain amount of
resistance to movement of the resection line guide 602 relative to the stomach 10. This resistance is
configured to prevent undesirable or unintentional movements of the resection line guide 602, but yet
permit the surgeon to move the resection line guide 602 to a desired position relative to the stomach
10 without significant difficulty. This may be achieved in this embodiment when the spring reel 622
takes up the slack in the flexible member 616, described above. In the second clamping stage, and
with the resection line guide 602 in the desired location relative to the stomach 10, the clamping force
of the resection line guide 602 may be increased above the threshold clamping force to effectively
prevent or minimize the resection line guide 602 from moving relative to the stomach 10. The upper
limit to which the resection line guide 602 may be clamped is selected so as to avoid any damage to
the underlying tissue being clamped. This may be achieved in this embodiment by engaging the
clamping mechanism 660, as described below.
[00245] From the configuration of the manipulator 604 shown in Fig. 33A (with the configuration of
                                                   63

 WO 2015/095333                                                                    PCT/US2014/070869
the resection line guide 602 shown in Fig. 33D), the surgeon may squeeze the clamping lever 662 in
the direction of the arrow 684 in Figs. 33A and 33B. When the surgeon squeezes the clamping lever
662, the actuator arm 664 enters the notch 668 of the clamping bracket 666 and forces the clamping
bracket 666 generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of the shaft 608. By this sliding motion of the
clamping bracket 666, the spring 672 is compressed against the lever arm 676 causing it to pivot and
pull the bead catcher against the bead 680. Further squeezing of the clamping lever 662 pulls the
flexible member 616 through the inner guide tube 627 substantially coincident with the longitudinal
axis of the inner guide tube 627 as is generally indicated by arrow 686 in Fig. 34A. This motion
causes retraction of the flexible member from the resection line guide 602.
[00246] In that regard, the retraction of the flexible member 616 according to the arrow 686 in Fig.
34A is translated into a similar retraction of the flexible member 616 in the resection line guide 602 as
is indicated by the arrow 686 in Fig. 34C. Retraction of the flexible member 616 causes the clamp
member 612 to forcibly collapse the stomach 10 against the clamp member 614 according to the
arrow 618. The stomach 10 may then be clamped as is shown in Fig. 34C. The surgeon may then
proceed to cut and staple the stomach 10 relying on the resection line guide 602 to provide the staple
line as described above.
[00247] In one embodiment and with reference to Figs. 34A and 34B, compressing the clamping
lever 662 toward the housing 620a, 620b pushes the clamping bracket 666 in the direction of the shaft
608 to a position in which the locking finger 706 engages the second stop 710. If the surgeon lets go
of the clamping lever 662, the stop and release mechanism 700 will maintain the clamping
mechanism 660 in its engaged position. The surgeon may then let go of the clamping lever 662 and
the tension on the flexible member 616 will be maintained.
[00248] When the resection line guide 602 is placed on the stomach 10 (e.g., in the first clamping
stage as described above), the surgeon has a clear visualization of the intended results of the vertical
sleeve gastrectomy prior to actually performing the resection of the stomach 10 at the resection line
12. Hence, the surgeon has an indication of what the resultant stomach volume defined by the lesser
curvature 28 and the resection line 12 will be prior to cutting tissue. If the surgeon is not satisfied with
the indication of the expected stomach volume, the surgeon may adjust and manipulate the location
and alignment of the resection line guide 602 prior to stapling and cutting the stomach 10. Once the
resection line guide 602 is finally positioned (e.g., the second clamping stage as described above), the
surgeon may then cut and staple the tissue using the resection line guide 602 as a track along the entire
segment or a significant part of the segment until complete resection of the stomach 10 occurs. In this
regard, a stapling device may abut or engage the resection line guide 602 along an alignment surface
to facilitate an improved resection line, similar to that shown above in Fig. 2D.

 WO 2015/095333                                                                     PCT/US2014/070869
[00249] With reference to Figs. 34A and 34B, after the resection line 12 is complete, in one
embodiment, the surgeon may disengage each of the locking mechanism 640 and the clamping
mechanism 660 by activating the stop and release mechanism 700. In particular, the surgeon may
depress the release lever 702 with a sufficient force to overcome the outwardly directed bias produced
by the spring 704 (and any friction between the stops 708, 710 and the locking finger 706). Pressing
on the release lever 702 rotates the locking finger 706 away from the first stop 708 and the second
stop 710. Once the locking finger 706 clears the first stop 708 and the second stop 710, the springs
648 and 672, which are compressed, may spontaneously expand (unless the surgeon grasps the levers
642, 662 to control the disengagement) thereby disengaging each of the locking mechanism 640 and
the clamping mechanism 660. By way of example, the springs 648 and 672 push the locking lever
642 and the clamping lever 662 from their engaged positions shown in Fig. 34A to their disengaged
positions shown in Fig. 32B.
[00250] In another embodiment and with reference now to Figs. 35-38, a medical device 800
performs substantially the same procedure as the medical devices 400 and 600, described above. To
that end, the medical device 800 includes a resection line guide 802, which may be one of the guides
described above, operatively coupled to a manipulator 804. As shown, the manipulator 804 includes
an elongate member or shaft 808 coupled to a handpiece 806 at one end and the resection line guide
802 at the other end thereof. As described above with respect to the medical devices 400 and 600,
during a surgical procedure, the resection line guide 802 and a portion of the shaft 808 may be
inserted into the patient, such as via a surgical trocar. The surgeon may then manipulate the resection
line guide 802 and/or articulate the resection line guide 802 relative to the manipulator 804 to perform
the procedure. Thus, embodiments of the present invention may include mechanisms for allowing the
resection line guide 802 to articulate relative to the shaft 808 (as is generally depicted by a cone 810 in
Fig. 35) and for effectuating a surgical procedure with the resection line guide 802. To at least those
ends, the manipulator 804 includes mechanisms that the surgeon may manipulate to independently
move the resection line guide 802 to clamp tissue and/or to pivot the resection line guide 802 relative
to the manipulator 804, as is described in detail below.
[00251] With reference to Figs. 35, 36, and 37A, the resection line guide 802 includes clamp
members 812, 814 that are movably coupled together via a flexible member 816 (shown in Fig. 36).
The flexible member 816 passes through hollow portions of the clamp members 812, 814 so that, for
example, the clamp member 812 may be separated from or brought closer to the clamp member 814
during a surgical procedure. In this regard, an anchor 817 fixes a first end of the flexible member 816
to the clamp member 814 adjacent a distal end thereof. Flexible member 816 passes into the clamp
member 812 adjacent a distal end thereto and out of the clamp member 812 adjacent a proximal end
                                                      65

 WO 2015/095333                                                                PCT/US2014/070869
thereto. Flexible member 816 then passes into the clamp member 814 adjacent a proximal end thereto
and into the shaft 808. Retraction of the flexible member 816 from the resection line guide 802
moves at least one of the clamp members 812, 814 as is shown generally by the arrow 815 in Fig. 36
and described below. By way of example only, and without limitation, the resection line guide 802
may include one of the exemplary resection line guides described above, such as, for example, those
shown in Figs. 3E, 4B, and 5A.       In the exemplary embodiment shown, the clamp member 814
includes a ball 818, which forms a portion of a joint 832 with the shaft 808 and through which the
flexible member 816 passes into the resection line guide 802.
[00252]   In one embodiment, the resection line guide 802 includes a tab 822. As shown in Fig. 36,
the tab 822 extends from the clamp member 812 and allows the surgeon to more easily position the
resection line guide 802 during initial placement and during removal following surgery.         In the
exemplary embodiment, the tab 822 is cable configured to accept surgical grippers, though it will be
appreciated that the clamp member 812 may include other features to which the surgeon may more
easily grasp and by which the surgeon may manipulate the resection line guide 802.
[00253]   With reference to Figs. 35, 37A, and 37B, in one embodiment, the manipulator 804 includes
a main body 820 having opposed operating knobs 826, 828 for manipulating portions of the medical
device 800. The main body 820 may include housing halves 820a, 820b (labeled in Fig. 35). Each
knob 826, 828 is independently rotatable relative to the main body 820 as is indicated by arrows 830
in Fig. 35. In one aspect, the surgeon may lock and unlock the orientation of the resection line guide
802 relative to the shaft 808 with one of the knobs 826, 828. In another aspect, the surgeon may
control the extension and retraction of the flexible member 816 from the resection line guide 802 to
move clamp member 812, 814 with the other of the knobs 826, 828.
[00254] With regard to the former aspect, in one embodiment, the joint 832 movably couples the
resection line guide 802 to the shaft 808. For example, the joint 832 may be a ball-and-socket type
joint which allows relative pivotal motion between the shaft 808 and the resection line guide 802 as is
indicated by cone 810 in Fig. 35. By rotating the knob 826, for example, the surgeon may operate a
mechanism located in at least the manipulator 804 to selectively lock and unlock the joint 832.
Unlocking the joint 832 allows the surgeon to change the relative orientation of the shaft 808 and the
resection line guide 802. The surgeon may use another laparoscopic instrument, such as a surgical
gripper, to change the orientation of the resection line guide 802, or the surgeon may push the
resection line guide 802 or shaft 808 against another object, such as tissue or the surgical trocar, to
provide the desired change in relative orientation.    Once positioned, locking the joint 832 fixes a
desired orientation between the resection line guide 802 and the shaft 808.
[00255]   To that end, in one embodiment, the manipulator 804 includes a locking mechanism 834
                                                   66

 WO 2015/095333                                                                   PCT/US2014/070869
that the surgeon may utilize to lock the orientation between the shaft 808 and the resection line guide
802. In the exemplary embodiment, the locking mechanism 834 allows for selective locking and
unlocking of the joint 832 and includes the knob 826 that cooperates with the main body 820.
[00256] With reference to Figs. 35 and 37A, the main body 820 may have a roughly cylindrical
shape with flats 836, 838 for ease of handling and gripping. A main bore 840 extends from one end
842 to an opposite end 844 of the main body 820 and receives portions of the locking mechanism 834.
In the exemplary embodiment shown, the main bore 840 extends along the longitudinal axis of the
main body 820 and has a variable inside diameter to define a first channel 846 that receives a portion
of the knob 826, a second channel 848 that receives a portion of the shaft 808, and a third channel 852
that receives a portion of the knob 828, each of which is described below.
[00257]    With regard to the locking mechanism 834, the knob 826 includes an engagement portion
854 that couples the knob 826 to the main body 820. The knob 826 is accessible to the surgeon and is
rotatable relative to the main body 820 by hand.         A rim 856 projects radially outward from the
engagement portion 854. The engagement portion 854 is rotably received in the bore 840 with the
rim 856 projecting into the first channel 846. By this configuration, the knob 826 is prevented from
being inadvertently separated from the main body 820 by providing an interference fit therebetween
that resists forces tending to pull the knob 826 axially away from the main body 820 but allows the
surgeon to rotate the knob 826.
[00258]    In the exemplary embodiment shown, the knob 826 may have a toroidal shape with an
inside surface 858. It will be appreciated that embodiments of the present invention are not limited to
any particular shape of the knob 826 (or to the shape of the knob 828). The dimension of the inside
surface 858 is sized to receive a portion of the shaft 808 therein. A portion of the inside surface 858 of
the knob 826 may include a thread 860 that cooperates with a portion of the shaft 808. By rotating the
knob 826, the thread 860 moves a portion of the shaft 808 so that the surgeon may lock and unlock the
joint 832 as described below.
[00259]    To that end, the shaft 808 includes an outer locking tube 862 and an inner guide tube 864.
As shown, the flexible member 816 extends from the main body 820 through the inner guide tube 864
to the joint 832. The inner guide tube 864 has a socket 866 that receives the ball 818 and thus the
socket 866 forms a portion of the joint 832. At its other end, the inner guide tube 864 includes a rim
868 that projects radially outward and is received in the second channel 848 of the bore 840. The
inner guide tube 864 and outer tube 862 are slidable relative to one another along an axis of the shaft
808. This relative sliding motion facilitates the locking and unlocking of the joint 832.
[00260]    Specifically, in the embodiment shown in Figs. 37A and 37B, the outer tube 862 is slidable
relative to the inner guide tube 864 along the axis of the shaft 808 as is indicated by the arrow 870.
                                                     67

 WO 2015/095333                                                                  PCT/US2014/070869
This motion may be produced by a thread 872 on the outer tube 862 that cooperates with the thread
860 on the knob 826. By rotating the knob 826, the thread 860 drives the thread 872 and provides an
axially directed sliding motion of the outer tube 862 toward or away from the joint 832 while the inner
tube 864 is held in a fixed axial position by interference between the rim 868 and the second channel
848.
[00261]    As the outer tube 862 slides toward the joint 832, the outer tube 862 compresses the socket
866 of the inner tube 864 on the ball 818. The resulting compression of the socket 866 increases the
frictional engagement in the joint 832 as the knob 826 is further rotated to tighten the thread 860
against the thread 872. The frictional contact between the ball 818 and the socket 866 resists relative
motion between the resection line guide 802 and the shaft 808. The joint 832 is shown in the locked
configuration with the outer tube 862 frictionally engaged with the socket 866 in Fig. 37A.
[00262]    The joint 832 is shown in the unlocked configuration in Fig. 37B such that the resection line
guide 802 may be pivotally adjusted, which is exemplified by arrows 874.                 To reach this
configuration, the surgeon rotates the knob 826 in the opposite direction to that shown in Fig. 37A.
This rotational direction of the knob 826 decreases the compression of the joint 832, retracts the outer
tube 862 from contact with the socket 866, and thereby unlocks the joint 832. In summary, rotating
the knob 826 in one direction locks the joint 832 in position, and rotation of the knob 826 in the other
direction unlocks the joint 832.
[00263]    With regard to the latter aspect, that is, controlling the extension and retraction of the
flexible member 816 to move the clamp members 812, 814, and with reference to Figs. 35 and 38, the
manipulator 804 includes a clamping mechanism 880. In one embodiment, the clamping mechanism
880 includes the knob 828. Generally, rotating the knob 828 in one direction extends the flexible
member 816 from the manipulator 804 to allow the clamp members 812, 814 to separate. Rotating
the knob 828 in the other direction retracts the flexible member 816 and causes the clamp members
812, 814 to move toward one another (as is generally indicated by arrow 886 in Fig. 38) or to clamp
tissue therebetween.
[00264]    To that end, the knob 828 includes an engagement portion 882. A rim 884 projects radially
outward from the engagement portion 882. The engagement portion 882 is rotably received in the
bore 840 with the rim 884 projecting into the third channel 852. By this configuration, the knob 828
is prevented from being inadvertently separated from the main body 820 by providing an interference
fit therebetween. The knob 828 resists separation from the main body 820 in an axial direction away
therefrom similar to the knob 826, described above.
[00265]    The engagement portion 882 defines an inner bore 888. The engagement portion 882 of the
knob 828 may extend the majority of the length of the main body 820.           By way of example, the
                                                    68

 WO 2015/095333                                                                PCT/US2014/070869
engagement portion 882 and the inner bore 888 may extend from 50% to 75% of the length of the
main body 820 as determined by ends 894, 896. A narrow region 900 in the main bore 840 may
separate the inner guide tube 864 from the inner bore 888. The narrow region 900 may reduce or
eliminate fluid leakage between the inner guide tube 864 and the inner bore 888 or other portions of
the main body 820. The knob 828, like the knob 826, is accessible to the surgeon and is rotatable
relative to the main body 820 by hand.
[00266]    In one embodiment, the clamping mechanism 880 includes a follower pin 890 that projects
into the inner bore 888 and may be mounted in the engagement portion 882. Further, a cam rod 892 is
slidably received in the main bore 840 of the main body 820 and is axially movable relative thereto
when the clamping mechanism 880 is engaged. A second end of the flexible member 816 is secured
to the cam rod 892 at one end 894 (shown in Fig. 37B) and so is retracted from the resection line
guide 802 or extended from the main body 820 during manipulation of the clamping mechanism 880.
[00267]    In particular, with reference to Fig. 38, the cam rod 892 is slidably received in the inner
guide tube 864 and in the inner bore 888 of the engagement portion 882. To facilitate movement of
the flexible member 816, the cam rod 892 has a helical groove 898 along at least a portion of its outer
surface. The follower pin 890 in the engagement portion 882 is slidably received in the helical groove
898.   Rotating the knob 828 rotates the engagement portion 882 and the follower pin 890. The
follower pin 890 interacts with the groove 898 to forcibly slide the cam rod 892 in one direction or in
the other direction relative to the main body 820. By this axial movement, the flexible member 816 is
extended or retracted depending on the direction that the knob 828 is rotated. By way of example,
rotation of the knob 828 in the clockwise direction forces the cam rod 892 in the direction of arrow
904 or toward the knob 828. This movement of the cam rod 892 retracts the flexible member 816
from the resection line guide 802.
[00268]    In one embodiment, as is shown in Fig. 38, the helical groove 898 progressively tightens
from one end 896 of the cam rod 892 to the opposite end 894 of the cam rod 892. In other words, the
spacing or pitch between successive rotations of the groove 898 at the end 896 is generally indicated
at 906. The spacing or pitch between successive rotations of the groove 898 toward the end 894 is
generally indicated at 908. As shown, the spacing at end 896 is larger than the spacing of the groove
898 toward the end 894. As such, a single rotation of the knob 828 while the follower pin 890 is
engaged with the groove 898 near the end 894 produces a greater axial displacement of the cam rod
892 than a single rotation of the knob 828 while the follower pin 890 is engaged with the groove 898
as the end 894 approaches.
[00269]    By this configuration, the surgeon may be able to more quickly bring the clamp members
812, 814 from a fully opened configuration (as shown in Fig. 38) to collapse the stomach 10 and
                                                    69

 WO 2015/095333                                                                  PCT/US2014/070869
during which gross movement of the clamp members 812, 814 is tolerable or even desirable because
it saves time. Once initially clamped, and with the follower pin 890 in the groove 898 closer to the
end 894, the spacing 908 provides more refined, slower, axial translation of the cam rod 892. This
finer movement may allow the surgeon to more finely adjust the position of the clamp members 812,
814 on the stomach 10 and so better control the clamping force. Once the procedure is complete, the
spacing difference in the groove 898 allows the surgeon to uncompress the stomach 10 and quickly
loosen the flexible member 816 so that the clamp members 812, 814 may be removed from the
patient.
[00270]    In one embodiment, and with reference to Fig. 38, the inner bore 888 of the knob 828 may
be capped with a plug 910. The plug 910 may define a bore 912 that fluidly communicates with the
inner bore 888 and with the cam rod 892. The surgeon, following a procedure and prior to the next
procedure, may inject cleaning solution into the inner bore 888 via the plug 910. This may include
removing the plug 910 and injecting the cleaning solution or may include inserting a syringe through
the bore 912 and injecting the cleaning solution.
[00271]    In an exemplary embodiment, the operation of each of the knobs 826, 828 will be described
in conjunction with operation of the resection line guide 802 during a surgical procedure.             In
particular, after the stomach has been effectively mobilized along its greater curve, the surgeon may
manipulate the medical device 800 to insert the resection line guide 802 and at least a portion of the
shaft 808 into the abdominal cavity through a surgical trocar. If the joint 832 is unlocked, the surgeon
may rotate the resection line guide 802 relative to the shaft 808. Once the resection line guide 802 is
properly positioned, the surgeon may lock the joint 832 by rotating the knob 826 in a direction which
forces the outer locking tube 862 into contact with the socket 866. It will be appreciated that the
surgeon may repeat positioning the resection line guide 802, locking the joint 832, and unlocking the
joint 832 to reposition the resection line guide 802 numerous times until the surgeon is satisfied that
the resection line guide 802 is properly positioned.
[00272]    The surgeon may separate the clamp members 812, 814, for example, by grasping and
pulling the tab 822 with a laparoscopic instrument. Because the first end of the flexible member 816
is fixed to the anchor 817, separating the clamp members 812, 814 causes the flexible member 816 to
slide through the clamp members 812, 814. After positioning the resection line guide 802 around the
stomach 10, the surgeon may secure the resection line guide 802 in position by manually moving the
clamp member 812 towards the clamp member 814. Once the resection line guide 802 is properly
positioned with the clamp member 812, 814 on either side of the stomach 10, the surgeon may take up
any slack in the flexible member 816 by rotating the knob 828 in a direction that draws the cam rod
892 into the main body 820 so as to pull the flexible member 816 from the resection line guide 802
                                                   70

 WO 2015/095333                                                                    PCT/US2014/070869
and cause the clamp members 812, 814 to compress on the stomach 10. When the cam rod 892 takes
up slack in the flexible member 816, the clamp members 812, 814 may generally vertically align
relative to the stomach 10.     At this point, the clamp members 812, 814 may begin to provide a
clamping force on the stomach 10.
[00273]    The securement of the resection line guide 802 to the stomach 10 may be achieved using the
two-stage clamping process as described above. In an advantageous aspect of this embodiment, one
mechanism may be used to provide the clamping force in both the first and second stages. More
particularly, the flexible member 816 may be pulled so as to generate a clamping force on the stomach
10 less than the threshold clamping force. Again, this first-stage clamping force is configured and
selected to provide a certain amount of resistance to movement of the resection line guide 802 relative
to the stomach 10. This resistance is configured to prevent undesirable or unintentional movements of
the resection line guide 802, but yet permit the surgeon to move the resection line guide 802 to a
desired position relative to the stomach 10 without significant difficulty. This may be achieved in this
embodiment by turning the knob 828 to move the cam rod 892, which takes up any slack in the
flexible member 816. In the second clamping stage, and with the resection line guide 802 in the
desired location relative to the stomach 10, the clamping force of the resection line guide 802 may be
increased above the threshold clamping force to effectively prevent or minimize the resection line
guide 802 from moving relative to the stomach 10. The upper limit to which the resection line guide
802 may be clamped is selected so as to avoid any damage to the underlying tissue being clamped.
This may be achieved in this embodiment by further turning knob 828, as described below.
[00274]    As the cam rod 892 is drawn into the main body 820, the rate at which the clamp members
812, 814 approach one another may slow as the follower pin 890 must trace the tighter spacing of the
helical groove 898 as the cam rod 892 slides further into the inner bore 888. The surgeon may feel an
increase in the torque required to rotate the knob 828 and so may make fine adjustments in the
position of the knob 828 to control the clamping force on the stomach 10.
[00275]    When the resection line guide 802 is placed on the stomach 10 (e.g., in the first clamping
stage as described above), the surgeon has a clear visualization of the intended results of the vertical
sleeve gastrectomy prior to actually performing the resection of the stomach 10 at the resection line
12. Hence, the surgeon has an indication of what the resultant stomach volume defined by the lesser
curvature 28 and the resection line 12 will be prior to cutting tissue. If the surgeon is not satisfied with
the indication of the expected stomach volume, the surgeon may adjust and manipulate the location
and alignment of the resection line guide 802 prior to stapling and cutting the stomach 10. Once the
resection line guide 802 is finally positioned (e.g., the second clamping stage as described above), the
surgeon may then cut and staple the tissue using the resection line guide 802 as a track along the entire
                                                     71

 WO 2015/095333                                                                   PCT/US2014/070869
segment or a significant part of the segment until complete resection of the stomach 10 occurs. In this
regard, a stapling device may abut or engage the resection line guide 802 along an alignment surface
to facilitate an improved resection line, similar to that shown above in Fig. 2D.
[00276]     Once the staple line is complete, the surgeon may rotate the knob 828 in the opposite
direction to allow extension of the flexible member 816 into the resection line guide 802. If the clamp
members 812, 814 do not spontaneously separate, the slack in the flexible member 816 may allow the
surgeon to separate the clamp members 812, 814 with a tool by pulling on the tab 822. The surgeon
may also rotate the knob 826 in the opposite direction to unlock the joint 832, which may aid in
removing the resection line guide 802 from the abdominal cavity. The bore 840 may be cleaned by
introducing a cleaning solution through the plug 910.
[00277]     It should be appreciated that the medical devices described above may be modified in
several ways, but remain within the scope and spirit of present invention. In embodiments of the
present invention where an articulation joint is used, it should be appreciated that the articulation joint
may take several forms. A previously discussed embodiment includes passive articulation at a joint
using gear teeth and a locking tab. As an alternative, active articulation may be used. For example, a
resection line guide may be pivotally connected to a shaft where the connection includes a turning
gear, which, when turned, rotates the resection line guide. The turning gear may be connected to a
separate component having gear teeth, where that component may be manipulated using one or more
bands or cables. Additional previously discussed embodiments include a freely rotating ball joint and
a ball joint that can be locked using a locking tube. A ball joint may be locked using features other
than a locking tube. In an embodiment, the surface of the ball may have a pattern of recessions that
are capable of mating with the pattern of protrusions on the locking member surface in a variety of
angles. When the locking member is in contact with the ball, the mating surfaces prevent the ball
from rotating. In a further embodiment, a ball joint may be locked using a spring capable of being
engaged and disengaged. Those of ordinary skill in the art may recognize still further embodiments
that allow for articulation at a joint.
[00278]     In embodiments of the present invention that allow for rotation of the clamp members
relative to an axis parallel to the clamp members, it should be appreciated that the method of this
rotation may take several forms. A previously discussed embodiment includes a resection line guide
having two clamp members where the clamp members are capable of mating at multiple angles. In
another embodiment, a resection line guide including a ball joint may be capable of free rotation. The
resection line guide may be connected to the articulation ball through a resection line guide connector
where the articulation ball encompasses the resection line guide connector but allows the resection
line guide connector to rotate within the articulation ball. An alternative embodiment may include a
                                                      72

 WO 2015/095333                                                                  PCT/US2014/070869
resection line guide capable of rotation where the rotation may be locked.        By way of example, a
clamp member connected to a shaft may be made of two segments have interlocking surfaces
connected by a pin. When the two segments are separated, the pin may allow the distal segment to
rotate while preventing the two segments from coming completely apart. The rotation of the clamp
members relative to an axis parallel to the clamp members may be provided using any other suitable
method or mechanism known in the art.
[00279]    In embodiments of the present invention where tensioning a flexible member provides a
clamping force on an anatomical structure, the flexible member may be manipulated in a variety of
ways. Previously discussed embodiments include tensioning a flexible member a cinch tube, a cinch
ring, a spring reel, and a slidable cam rod. In another embodiment, the flexible member may be
connected to a manual reel, where the surgeon manually reels in the flexible member to tighten the
resection line guide. Alternatively, the flexible member may be connected to a powered reel, where
the surgeon controls a motor that causes the flexible member to be taken up. In another embodiment,
the ends of the flexible member may be clamped together where the ends may be pulled through a
shaft by a handle, similar to a feature used in a Rumel tourniquet. In another embodiment, the flexible
cable connecting two clamp members could be connected to a rack, where the rack can be ratcheted
and held in place by a pin that contacts the ridges of the rack. Alternatively, the rack could be moved
by turning a gear that engages the ridges on the rack. In another embodiment, the rack could be
powered by a motor.       Another embodiment may include an accumulator to take up the flexible
member. As is shown in Fig. 39, the accumulator 920 may include a flexible member 922 connected
to and entwined in two sets of pins 924. When one end of the flexible member 922 is released or
pulled from the accumulator 920, the sets of pins 924 move towards each other. The accumulator 920
may include a mechanism 926 that may be configured to increase or decrease the distance between
the sets of pins 924.    The mechanism 926 may include, for example, a torque shaft 926a and a
carriage 926b that carries one of the sets of pins 924. When the mechanism 926 is engaged, the
carriage may move to increase the distance between the sets of pins 924 causing the flexible member
922 to be drawn into the accumulator 920 (not shown). The length of the flexible member 922 able to
be taken up or released by the accumulator 920 increases as more pins are used. Those of ordinary
skill in the art may recognize still further embodiments that take up and add tension to the flexible
member.      The flexible member may be taken up using any suitable method known in the art.
Additionally, a combination of methods may be utilized to take up the flexible member, which could
allow for variation in the speed and control of the take up. For example, a rack and cam rod may be
used together, where the flexible member is capable of being taken up by both moving the rack and
moving the cam rod. The rack may be pulled for quick take up of the flexible member, and a knob
                                                    73

 WO 2015/095333                                                                    PCT/US2014/070869
may be spun to move the cam rod for a more controlled take up of the flexible member. Further, if
more than one flexible member is used, the flexible members may have the same or independent take
up and tensioning mechanisms.
[00280]    In an aspect of the present invention, certain embodiments may provide an indication of the
magnitude or level of the clamping force being provided by the resection line guide. A previously
discussed embodiment including a cam rod capable of taking up a length of the flexible member
provides the surgeon a tactile indication of the magnitude of the clamping force. In this regard, the
torque required to move the cam rod may increase as the amount of flexible member taken up
increases. In an alternate embodiment, a resection line guide or medical device may include a visual
indicator.   By way of example, a medical device may include an indicator window showing an
indicator bar that moves as the clamping force decreases or increases. Another embodiment that is
capable of measuring the clamping force may display the amount of clamping force or pressure the
resection line guide is providing.
[00281]    In a further advantageous aspect, certain embodiments of the present invention may include
a mechanism that limits the clamping force. A previously discussed embodiment included a force
limiter and force limiter spring that acted upon the flexible member to limit the force.          In an
embodiment including a clamping force indicator, a maximum clamping force may also be
designated, which indicates to the surgeon the danger of exceeding that clamping force. In another
embodiment, the length of flexible member able to be taken up may be limited. By way of example,
in an embodiment where the flexible member may be taken up by moving a cam rod, the cam rod
may be prevented from moving past a point where an unwanted amount of force is provided by the
resection line guide. In an alternate embodiment, a slip-clutch feature may be included to prevent an
element with a helical groove from moving past a certain point. Those of ordinary skill in the art may
recognize still further embodiments that limit the clamping force provided by the resection line guide.
[00282]    In an advantageous aspect of the invention, the resection line guide may be deployable
around an anatomical structure. Further, where a medical device according to the present invention is
used, the resection line guide may be separable from the manipulator (not shown).            Where the
resection line guide may be deployable, the trocar that had been used to place the resection line guide
may be used for another purpose, such as inserting another laparoscopic instrument. The resection
line guide may be detached at any suitable point in the procedure. In embodiments where two clamp
members are connected to provide a clamping force, it is possible that the two clamp members will be
placed in the abdominal cavity using two trocars.        In a case like this, the surgeon may choose to
detach the shaft of the instrument used to place one of the clamp members freeing up one trocar. The
surgeon may keep one of the clamp members attached to the handle of the instrument used to place it,
                                                    74

 WO 2015/095333                                                                    PCT/US2014/070869
which could increase stability of the resection line guide and control over the stomach while stapling
along the resection line guide. Alternatively, the surgeon could detach both clamp members leaving
the resection line guide fully deployed on the stomach.
[00283]    Methods of using embodiments of the present invention are discussed above.             Broadly,
embodiments of the present invention involving resection line guides may be placed inside an
abdominal cavity, or other portion of the body, and placed around an anatomical structure to be at
least partially resected. Once placed around the anatomical structure, the resection line guide may
then be manipulated to provide a clamping force on the anatomical structure. The resection line guide
may act as a physical guide that assists the surgeon in envisioning and creating a resection line. The
surgeon may use the resection line guide as a spacer or as an aid in estimating the distance of the
projected resection line to anatomical landmarks. In creating a staple resection line, the stapler may
abut the resection line guide, which aids in creating the desired staple line. The surgeon may choose
to resect the anatomical structure to the anatomical left or right of the resection line guide. Straight or
curved resection lines may be created in procedures using a resection line guide according to the
present invention. Embodiments of the present invention may also aid in control and manipulation of
the anatomical structure during the resection. In other words, the resection line guide may act as both
a clamp and a guide during the resection.
[00284] In another aspect, certain embodiments of the present invention may include two resection
line guides positioned on an anatomical structure. In embodiments such as these, the two resection
line guides may be positioned on each side of the desired resection line. This may increase the
surgeon's control of the anatomical structure during the medical procedure, which may allow for an
improved resection line.
[00285]    Embodiments of the present invention including two clamp members coupled by a flexible
member contemplate an amount of slack between the two clamp members when separated.                    The
extent of the available slack affects the method of placing the resection line guide around the stomach.
The clamp members may have, for example, about three to about five inches of slack at both the
proximal and distal ends between the two clamp members when separated. In an embodiment such as
this, the stomach may be mobilized and moved to the side while the bottom clamp member is put into
place. The stomach may then be flipped over the bottom clamp member and the top clamp member
may be manipulated over the stomach. Alternately, there may be, for example, about one to about
three inches of slack between both ends of the clamp members when separated. In embodiments with
this amount of slack, the stomach may be slid between the open clamp members using laparoscopic
instruments.
[00286]    While the present invention has been illustrated by a description of various preferred
                                                    75

embodiments and while these embodiments have been described in some detail, it is not the intention
of the inventor to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Though
the embodiments described herein were primarily directed to a resection line guide, it is clear that
many of the aspects of the present invention may be utilized with additional devices. By way of
example, the embodiments described herein may operate as a surgical clamp or a stabilizing device
independent of the aspects of the present invention that allow the embodiments to act as a guide to a
medical instrument. Additional advantages and modifications will readily appear to those skilled in
the art. The various features of the invention may be used alone or in any combination depending on
the needs and preferences of the user.
