                                           ABSTRACT
         Systems for examining a route inject one or more electrical examination signals into a
conductive route from onboard a vehicle system traveling along the route, detect one or more
electrical characteristics of the route based on the one or more electrical examination signals,
and detect a break in conductivity of the route responsive to the one or more electrical
characteristics decreasing by more than a designated drop threshold for a time period within a
designated drop time period.         Feature vectors may be determined for the electrical
characteristics and compared to one or more patterns in order to distinguish between breaks
in the conductivity of the route and other causes for changes in the electrical characteristics.

                                  ROUTE EXAMINING SYSTEM
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]       The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent
Application No. <removed-apn>, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
reference.
FIELD
[0002]       Embodiments of the subject matter disclosed herein relate to examining routes
traveled by vehicles for damage to the routes and/or to determine information about the
routes and/or vehicles.
BACKGROUND
[0003]       Routes that are traveled by vehicles may become damaged over time with
extended use. For example, tracks on which rail vehicles travel may become damaged and/or
broken. A variety of known systems are used to examine rail tracks to identify where the
damaged and/or broken portions of the track are located. For example, some systems use
cameras, lasers, and the like, to optically detect breaks and damage to the tracks.       The
cameras and lasers may be mounted on the rail vehicles, but the accuracy of the cameras and
lasers may be limited by the speed at which the rail vehicles move during inspection of the
route. As a result, the cameras and lasers may not be able to be used during regular operation
(e.g., travel) of the rail vehicles in revenue service.
[0004]       Other systems use ultrasonic transducers that are placed at or near the tracks to
ultrasonically inspect the tracks.      These systems may require very slow movement of the
transducers relative to the tracks in order to detect damage to the track. When a suspect
location is found by an ultrasonic inspection vehicle, a follow-up manual inspection may be
required for confirmation of defects using transducers that are manually positioned and
moved along the track and/or are moved along the track by a relatively slower moving
inspection vehicle. Inspections of the track can take a considerable amount of time, during
which the inspected section of the route may be unusable by regular route traffic.
[0005]       Other systems use human inspectors who move along the track to inspect for
broken and/or damaged sections of track. This manual inspection is slow and prone to errors.

[0006]      Other systems use wayside devices that send electric signals through the tracks. If
the signals are not received by other wayside devices, then a circuit that includes the track is
identified as being open and the track is considered to be broken. These systems are limited
at least in that the wayside devices are immobile. As a result, the systems cannot inspect
large spans of track and/or a large number of devices must be installed in order to inspect the
large spans of track. These systems are also limited at least in that a single circuit could
stretch for multiple miles.     As a result, if the track is identified as being open and is
considered broken, it is difficult and time-consuming to locate the exact location of the break
within the long circuit. For example, a maintainer must patrol the length of the circuit to
locate the problem.
[0007]      These systems are also limited at least in that other track features, such as
highway (e.g., hard wire) crossing shunts, wide band (e.g., capacitors) crossing shunts,
narrow band (e.g., tuned) crossing shunts, switches, insulated joints, and turnouts (e.g., track
switches) may emulate the signal response expected from a broken rail and provide a false
alarm.    For example, scrap metal on the track, crossing shunts, etc., may short the rails
together, preventing the current from traversing the length of the circuit, indicating that the
circuit is open.     Additionally, insulated joints and/or turnouts may include intentional
conductive breaks that create an open circuit.        In response, the system may identify a
potentially broken section of track, and a person or machine may be dispatched to patrol the
circuit to locate the break, even if the detected break is a false alarm (e.g., not a break in the
track). A need remains to reduce the probability of false alarms to make route maintenance
more efficient.
[0008]       Some vehicle location determination systems may be unable to determine
locations of the vehicle systems in some circumstances. For example, during initialization of
the location determination systems, the vehicle system may be unable to determine the
location of the vehicle system. During travel of the vehicle system in certain locations such
as tunnels, valleys, urban areas, etc., the location determination systems may be unable to
determine the locations of the vehicle systems.         An improved manner for determining
locations of vehicle systems is needed.
[0009]      A reference herein to a patent document or other matter which is given as prior art
is not to be taken as an admission that the document or matter was known or that the

information it contains was part of the common general knowledge as at the priority date of
any the claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0036]      Embodiments of the inventive subject matter described herein relate to systems
for examining a route being traveled upon by a vehicle system in order to identify potential
sections of the route that are damaged or broken. In an embodiment, the vehicle system may
                                                 5)

examine the route by injecting an electrical signal into the route from a first vehicle in the
vehicle system as the vehicle system travels along the route and monitoring the route at
another, second vehicle that also is in the vehicle system. Detection of the signal at the
second vehicle and/or detection of changes in the signal at the second vehicle may indicate a
potentially damaged (e.g., broken or partially broken) section of the route between the first
and second vehicles. In an embodiment, the route may be a track of a rail vehicle system and
the first and second vehicle may be used to identify a broken or partially broken section of
one or more rails of the track. The electrical signal that is injected into the route may be
powered by an onboard energy storage device, such as one or more batteries, and/or an off
board energy source, such as a catenary and/or electrified rail of the route.          When the
damaged section of the route is identified, one or more responsive actions may be initiated.
For example, the vehicle system may automatically slow down or stop. As another example,
a warning signal may be communicated (e.g., transmitted or broadcast) to one or more other
vehicle systems to warn the other vehicle systems of the damaged section of the route, to one
or more wayside devices disposed at or near the route so that the wayside devices can
communicate the warning signals to one or more other vehicle systems. In another example,
the warning signal may be communicated to an off-board facility that can arrange for the
repair and/or further examination of the damaged section of the route.
[0037]      The term "vehicle" as used herein can be defined as a mobile machine that
transports at least one of a person, people, or a cargo. For instance, a vehicle can be, but is
not limited to being, a rail car, an intermodal container, a locomotive, a marine vessel, mining
equipment, construction equipment, an automobile, and the like. A "vehicle system" includes
two or more vehicles that are interconnected with each other to travel along a route. For
example, a vehicle system can include two or more vehicles that are directly connected to
each other (e.g., by a coupler) or that are indirectly connected with each other (e.g., by one or
more other vehicles and couplers). A vehicle system can be referred to as a consist, such as a
rail vehicle consist.
[0038]      "Software" or "computer program" as used herein includes, but is not limited to,
one or more computer readable and/or executable instructions that cause a computer or other
electronic device to perform functions, actions, and/or behave in a desired manner.          The
instructions may be embodied in various forms such as routines, algorithms, modules or
programs including separate applications or code from dynamically linked libraries.
                                                 6

Software may also be implemented in various forms such as a stand-alone program, a
function call, a servlet, an applet, an application, instructions stored in a memory, part of an
operating system or other type of executable instructions.           "Computer" or "processing
element" or "computer device" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, any programmed
or programmable electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data. "Non-transitory
computer-readable media" include, but are not limited to, a CD-ROM, a removable flash
memory card, a hard disk drive, a magnetic tape, and a floppy disk. "Computer memory", as
used herein, refers to a storage device configured to store digital data or information which
can be retrieved by a computer or processing element. "Controller," "unit," and/or "module,"
as used herein, can to the logic circuitry and/or processing elements and associated software
or program involved in controlling an energy storage system. The terms "signal", "data", and
"information" may be used interchangeably herein and may refer to digital or analog forms.
[0039]      Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of a vehicle system 100 that includes an
embodiment of a route examining system 102.           The vehicle system 100 includes several
vehicles 104, 106 that are mechanically connected with each other to travel along a route 108.
The vehicles 104 (e.g., the vehicles 104A-C) represent propulsion-generating vehicles, such
as vehicles that generate tractive effort or power in order to propel the vehicle system 100
along the route 108. In an embodiment, the vehicles 104 can represent rail vehicles such as
locomotives.     The vehicles 106 (e.g., the vehicles 106A-E) represent non-propulsion
generating vehicles, such as vehicles that do not generate tractive effort or power. In an
embodiment, the vehicles 106 can represent rail cars. Alternatively, the vehicles 104, 106
may represent other types of vehicles. In another embodiment, one or more of the individual
vehicles 104 and/or 106 represent a group of vehicles, such as a consist of locomotives or
other vehicles.
[0040]      The route 108 can be a body, surface, or medium on which the vehicle system 100
travels. In an embodiment, the route 108 can include or represent a body that is capable of
conveying a signal between vehicles in the vehicle system 100, such as a conductive body
capable of conveying an electrical signal (e.g., a direct current, alternating current, radio
frequency, or other signal).
[0041]      The examining system 102 can be distributed between or among two or more
vehicles 104, 106 of the vehicle system 100. For example, the examining system 102 may
include two or more components that operate to identify potentially damaged sections of the
                                                 7

route 108, with at least one component disposed on each of two different vehicles 104, 106 in
the same vehicle system 100. In the illustrated embodiment, the examining system 102 is
distributed between or among two different vehicles 104.          Alternatively, the examining
system 102 may be distributed among three or more vehicles 104, 106. Additionally or
alternatively, the examining system 102 may be distributed between one or more vehicles 104
and one or more vehicles 106, and is not limited to being disposed onboard a single type of
vehicle 104 or 106. As described below, in another embodiment, the examining system 102
may be distributed between a vehicle in the vehicle system and an off-board monitoring
location, such as a wayside device.
[0042]       In operation, the vehicle system 100 travels along the route 108. A first vehicle
104 electrically injects an examination signal into the route 108.       For example, the first
vehicle 104A may apply a direct current, alternating current, radio frequency signal, or the
like, to the route 108 as an examination signal. The examination signal propagates through or
along the route 108. A second vehicle 104B or 104C may monitor one or more electrical
characteristics of the route 108 when the examination signal is injected into the route 108.
[0043]       The examining system 102 can be distributed among two separate vehicles 104
and/or 106.     In the illustrated embodiment, the examining system 102 has components
disposed onboard at least two of the propulsion-generating vehicles 104A, 104B, 104C.
Additionally or alternatively, the examining system 102 may include components disposed
onboard at least one of the non-propulsion generating vehicles 106.           For example, the
examining system 102 may be located onboard two or more propulsion-generating vehicles
104, two or more non-propulsion generating vehicles 106, or at least one propulsion
generating vehicle 104 and at least one non-propulsion generating vehicle 106.
[0044]       In operation, during travel of the vehicle system 100 along the route 108, the
examining system 102 electrically injects an examination signal into the route 108 at a first
vehicle 104 or 106 (e.g., beneath the footprint of the first vehicle 104 or 106). For example,
an onboard or off-board power source may be controlled to apply a direct current, alternating
current, RF signal, or the like, to a track of the route 108.       The examining system 102
monitors electrical characteristics of the route 108 at a second vehicle 104 or 106 of the same
vehicle system 100 (e.g., beneath the footprint of the second vehicle 104 or 106) in order to
determine if the examination signal is detected in the route 108. For example, the voltage,
current, resistance, impedance, or other electrical characteristic of the route 108 may be

monitored at the second vehicle 104, 106 in order to determine if the examination signal is
detected and/or if the examination signal has been altered. If the portion of the route 108
between the first and second vehicles conducts the examination signal to the second vehicle,
then the examination signal may be detected by the examining system 102. The examining
system 102 may determine that the route 108 (e.g., the portion of the route 108 through which
the examination signal propagated) is intact and/or not damaged.
[0045]      On the other hand, if the portion of the route 108 between the first and second
vehicles does not conduct the examination signal to the second vehicle (e.g., such that the
examination signal is not detected in the route 108 at the second vehicle), then the
examination signal may not be detected by the examining system 102.            The examining
system 102 may determine that the route 108 (e.g., the portion of the route 108 disposed
between the first and second vehicles during the time period that the examination signal is
expected or calculated to propagate through the route 108) is not intact and/or is damaged.
For example, the examining system 102 may determine that the portion of a track between
the first and second vehicles is broken such that a continuous conductive pathway for
propagation of the examination signal does not exist. The examining system 102 can identify
this section of the route as being a potentially damaged section of the route 108. In routes
108 that are segmented (e.g., such as rail tracks that may have gaps), the examining system
102 may transmit and attempt to detect multiple examination signals in order to prevent false
detection of a broken portion of the route 108.
[0046]      Because the examination signal may propagate relatively quickly through the
route 108 (e.g., faster than a speed at which the vehicle system 100 moves), the route 108 can
be examined using the examination signal when the vehicle system 100 is moving, such as
transporting cargo or otherwise operating at or above a non-zero, minimum speed limit of the
route 108.
[0047]      Additionally or alternatively, the examining system 102 may detect one or more
changes in the examination signal at the second vehicle.         The examination signal may
propagate through the route 108 from the first vehicle to the second vehicle. But, due to
damaged portions of the route 108 between the first and second vehicles, one or more signal
characteristics of the examination signal may have changed. For example, the signal-to-noise
ratio, intensity, power, or the like, of the examination signal may be known or designated
when injected into the route 108 at the first vehicle.          One or more of these signal
                                                Q

characteristics may change (e.g., deteriorate or decrease) during propagation through a
mechanically damaged or deteriorated portion of the route 108, even though the examination
signal is received (e.g., detected) at the second vehicle. The signal characteristics can be
monitored upon receipt of the examination signal at the second vehicle. Based on changes in
one or more of the signal characteristics, the examining system 102 may identify the portion
of the route 108 that is disposed between the first and second vehicles as being a potentially
damaged portion of the route 108. For example, if the signal-to-noise ratio, intensity, power,
or the like, of the examination signal decreases below a designated threshold and/or decreases
by more than a designated threshold decrease, then the examining system 102 may identify
the section of the route 108 as being potentially damaged.
[0048]       In response to identifying a section of the route 108 as being damaged or
damaged, the examining system 102 may initiate one or more responsive actions.               For
example, the examining system 102 can automatically slow down or stop movement of the
vehicle system 100. The examining system 102 can automatically issue a warning signal to
one or more other vehicle systems traveling nearby of the damaged section of the route 108
and where the damaged section of the route 108 is located. The examining system 102 may
automatically communicate a warning signal to a stationary wayside device located at or near
the route 108 that notifies the device of the potentially damaged section of the route 108 and
the location of the potentially damaged section.        The stationary wayside device can then
communicate a signal to one or more other vehicle systems traveling nearby of the potentially
damaged section of the route 108 and where the potentially damaged section of the route 108
is located. The examining system 102 may automatically issue an inspection signal to an off
board facility, such as a repair facility, that notifies the facility of the potentially damaged
section of the route 108 and the location of the section. The facility may then send one or
more inspectors to check and/or repair the route 108 at the potentially damaged section.
Alternatively, the examining system 102 may notify an operator of the potentially damaged
section of the route 108 and the operator may then manually initiate one or more responsive
actions.
[0049]       Figure 2 is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of an examining system 200.
The examining system 200 may represent the examining system 102 shown in Figure 1. The
examining system 200 is distributed between a first vehicle 202 and a second vehicle 204 in
the same vehicle system. The vehicles 202, 204 may represent vehicles 104 and/or 106 of the
                                                  in

vehicle system 100 shown in Figure 1. In an embodiment, the vehicles 202, 204 represent
two of the vehicles 104, such as the vehicle 104A and the vehicle 104B, the vehicle 104B and
the vehicle 104C, or the vehicle 104A and the vehicle 104C. Alternatively, one or more of
the vehicles 202, 204 may represent at least one of the vehicles 106. In another embodiment,
the examining system 200 may be distributed among three or more of the vehicles 104 and/or
106.
[0050]      The examining system 200 includes several components described below that are
disposed onboard the vehicles 202, 204.       For example, the illustrated embodiment of the
examining system 200 includes a control unit 208, an application device 210, an onboard
power source 212 ("Battery" in Figure 2), one or more conditioning circuits 214, a
communication unit 216, and one or more switches 224 disposed onboard the first vehicle
202. The examining system 200 also includes a detection unit 218, an identification unit 220,
a detection device 230, and a communication unit 222 disposed onboard the second vehicle
204. Alternatively, one or more of the control unit 208, application device 210, power source
212, conditioning circuits 214, communication unit 216, and/or switch 224 may be disposed
onboard the second vehicle 204 and/or another vehicle in the same vehicle system, and/or one
or more of the detection unit 218, identification unit 220, detection device 230, and
communication unit 222 may be disposed onboard the first vehicle 202 and/or another
vehicle in the same vehicle system.
[0051]      The control unit 206 controls supply of electric current to the application device
210. In an embodiment, the application device 210 includes one or more conductive bodies
that engage the route 108 as the vehicle system that includes the vehicle 202 travels along the
route 108. For example, the application device 210 can include a conductive shoe, brush, or
other body that slides along an upper and/or side surface of a track such that a conductive
pathway is created that extends through the application device 210 and the track.
Additionally or alternatively, the application device 210 can include a conductive portion of a
wheel of the first vehicle 202, such as the conductive outer periphery or circumference of the
wheel that engages the route 108 as the first vehicle 202 travels along the route 108.       In
another embodiment, the application device 210 may be inductively coupled with the route
108 without engaging or touching the route 108 or any component that engages the route 108.
[0052]      The application device 210 is conductively coupled with the switch 224, which
can represent one or more devices that control the flow of electric current from the onboard
                                                11

power source 212 and/or the conditioning circuits 214. The switch 224 can be controlled by
the control unit 206 so that the control unit 206 can turn on or off the flow of electric current
through the application device 210 to the route 108. In an embodiment, the switch 224 also
can be controlled by the control unit 206 to vary one or more waveforms and/or waveform
characteristics (e.g., phase, frequency, amplitude, and the like) of the current that is applied to
the route 108 by the application device 210.
[0053]       The onboard power source 212 represents one or more devices capable of storing
electric energy, such as one or more batteries, capacitors, flywheels, and the like.
Additionally or alternatively, the power source 212 may represent one or more devices
capable of generating electric current, such as an alternator, generator, photovoltaic device,
gas turbine, or the like. The power source 212 is coupled with the switch 224 so that the
control unit 206 can control when the electric energy stored in the power source 212 and/or
the electric current generated by the power source 212 is conveyed as electric current (e.g.,
direct current, alternating current, an RF signal, or the like) to the route 108 via the
application device 210.
[0054]       The conditioning circuit 214 represents one or more circuits and electric
components that change characteristics of electric current.      For example, the conditioning
circuit 214 may include one or more inverters, converters, transformers, batteries, capacitors,
resistors, inductors, and the like. In the illustrated embodiment, the conditioning circuit 214
is coupled with a connecting assembly 226 that is configured to receive electric current from
an off-board source. For example, the connecting assembly 226 may include a pantograph
that engages an electrified conductive pathway 228 (e.g., a catenary) extending along the
route 108 such that the electric current from the catenary 228 is conveyed via the connecting
assembly 226 to the conditioning circuit 214. Additionally or alternatively, the electrified
conductive pathway 228 may represent an electrified portion of the route 108 (e.g., an
electrified rail) and the connecting assembly 226 may include a conductive shoe, brush,
portion of a wheel, or other body that engages the electrified portion of the route 108.
Electric current is conveyed from the electrified portion of the route 108 through the
connecting assembly 226 and to the conditioning circuit 214.
[0055]       The electric current that is conveyed to the conditioning circuit 214 from the
power source 212 and/or the off-board source (e.g., via the connecting assembly 226) can be
altered by the conditioning circuit 214. For example, the conditioning circuit 214 can change
                                                 12

the voltage, current, frequency, phase, magnitude, intensity, waveform, and the like, of the
current that is received from the power source 212 and/or the connecting assembly 226. The
modified current can be the examination signal that is electrically injected into the route 108
by the application device 210. Additionally or alternatively, the control unit 206 can form the
examination signal by controlling the switch 224. For example, the examination signal can
be formed by turning the switch 224 on to allow current to flow from the conditioning circuit
214 and/or the power source 212 to the application device 210.
[0056]      In an embodiment, the control unit 206 may control the conditioning circuit 214 to
form the examination signal. For example, the control unit 206 may control the conditioning
circuit 214 to change the voltage, current, frequency, phase, magnitude, intensity, waveform,
and the like, of the current that is received from the power source 212 and/or the connecting
assembly 226 to form the examination signal. The examination signal optionally may be a
waveform that includes multiple frequencies. The examination signal may include multiple
harmonics or overtones. The examination signal may be a square wave or the like.
[0057]      The examination signal is conducted through the application device 210 to the
route 108, and is electrically injected into a conductive portion of the route 108.         For
example, the examination signal may be conducted into a conductive track of the route 108.
In another embodiment, the application device 210 may not directly engage (e.g., touch) the
route 108, but may be wirelessly coupled with the route 108 in order to electrically inject the
examination signal into the route 108 (e.g., via induction).
[0058]      The conductive portion of the route 108 that extends between the first and second
vehicles 202, 204 during travel of the vehicle system may form a track circuit through which
the examination signal may be conducted. The first vehicle 202 can be coupled (e.g., coupled
physically, coupled wirelessly, among others) to the track circuit by the application device
210. The power source (e.g., the onboard power source 212 and/or the off-board electrified
conductive pathway 228) can transfer power (e.g., the examination signal) through the track
circuit toward the second vehicle 204.
[0059]      By way of example and not limitation, the first vehicle 202 can be coupled to a
track of the route 108, and the track can be the track circuit that extends and conductively
couples one or more components of the examining system 200 on the first vehicle 202 with
one or more components of the examining system 200 on the second vehicle 204.
                                                11

[0060]      In an embodiment, the control unit 206 includes or represents a manager
component.     Such a manager component can be configured to activate a transmission of
electric current into the route 108 via the application device 210. In another instance, the
manager component can activate or deactivate a transfer of the portion of power from the
onboard and/or off-board power source to the application device 210, such as by controlling
the switch and/or conditioning circuit.      Moreover, the manager component can adjust
parameter(s) associated with the portion of power that is transferred to the route 108. For
instance, the manager component can adjust an amount of power transferred, a frequency at
which the power is transferred (e.g., a pulsed power delivery, AC power, among others), a
duration of time the portion of power is transferred, among others. Such parameter(s) can be
adjusted by the manager component based on at least one of a geographic location of the
vehicle or the device or an identification of the device (e.g., type, location, make, model,
among others).
[0061]      The manager component can leverage a geographic location of the vehicle or the
device in order to adjust a parameter for the portion of power that can be transferred to the
device from the power source. For instance, the amount of power transferred can be adjusted
by the manager component based on the device power input. By way of example and not
limitation, the portion of power transferred can meet or be below the device power input in
order to reduce risk of damage to the device. In another example, the geographic location of
the vehicle and/or the device can be utilized to identify a particular device and, in turn, a
power input for such device. The geographic location of the vehicle and/or the device can be
ascertained by a location on a track circuit, identification of the track circuit, Global
Positioning Service (GPS), among others.
[0062]      The detection unit 218 disposed onboard the second vehicle 204 as shown in
Figure 2 monitors the route 108 to attempt to detect the examination signal that is injected
into the route 108 by the first vehicle 202.     The detection unit 218 is coupled with the
detection device 230.    In an embodiment, the detection device 230 includes one or more
conductive bodies that engage the route 108 as the vehicle system that includes the vehicle
204 travels along the route 108.     For example, the detection device 230 can include a
conductive shoe, brush, or other body that slides along an upper and/or side surface of a track
such that a conductive pathway is created that extends through the detection device 230 and
the track. Additionally or alternatively, the detection device 230 can include a conductive
                                               14

portion of a wheel of the second vehicle 204, such as the conductive outer periphery or
circumference of the wheel that engages the route 108 as the second vehicle 204 travels along
the route 108. In another embodiment, the detection device 230 may be inductively coupled
with the route 108 without engaging or touching the route 108 or any component that engages
the route 108.
[0063]      The detection unit 218 monitors one or more electrical characteristics of the route
108 using the detection device 230. For example, the voltage of a direct current conducted by
the route 108 may be detected by monitoring the voltage conducted along the route 108 to the
detection device 230. In another example, the current (e.g., frequency, amps, phases, or the
like) of an alternating current or RF signal being conducted by the route 108 may be detected
by monitoring the current conducted along the route 108 to the detection device 230. As
another example, the signal-to-noise ratio of a signal being conducted by the detection device
230 from the route 108 may be detected by the detection unit 218 examining the signal
conducted by the detection device 230 (e.g., a received signal) and comparing the received
signal to a designated signal. For example, the examination signal that is injected into the
route 108 using the application device 210 may include a designated signal or portion of a
designated signal. The detection unit 218 may compare the received signal that is conducted
from the route 108 into the detection device 230 with this designated signal in order to
measure a signal-to-noise ratio of the received signal.
[0064]      The detection unit 218 determines one or more electrical characteristics of the
signal that is received (e.g., picked up) by the detection device 230 from the route 108 and
reports the characteristics of the received signal to the identification unit 220.  The one or
more electrical characteristics may include voltage, current, frequency, phase, phase shift or
difference, modulation, intensity, embedded signature, and the like. If no signal is received
by the detection device 230, then the detection unit 218 may report the absence of such a
signal to the identification unit 220. For example, if the detection unit 218 does not detect at
least a designated voltage, designated current, or the like, as being received by the detection
device 230, then the detection unit 218 may not detect any received signal. Alternatively or
additionally, the detection unit 218 may communicate the detection of a signal that is
received by the detection device 230 only upon detection of the signal by the detection device
230.

[0065]      In an embodiment, the detection unit 218 may determine the characteristics of the
signals received by the detection device 230 in response to a notification received from the
control unit 206 in the first vehicle 202. For example, when the control unit 206 is to cause
the application device 210 to inject the examination signal into the route 108, the control unit
206 may direct the communication unit 216 to transmit a notification signal to the detection
device 230 via the communication unit 222 of the second vehicle 204. The communication
units 216, 222 may include respective antennas 232, 234 and associated circuitry for
wirelessly communicating signals between the vehicles 202, 204, and/or with off-board
locations.    The communication unit 216 may wirelessly transmit a notification to the
detection unit 218 that instructs the detection unit 218 as to when the examination signal is to
be input into the route 108. Additionally or alternatively, the communication units 216, 222
may be connected via one or more wires, cables, and the like, such as a multiple unit (MU)
cable, train line, or other conductive pathway(s), to allow communication between the
communication units 216, 222.
[0066]      The detection unit 218 may begin monitoring signals received by the detection
device 230. For example, the detection unit 218 may not begin or resume monitoring the
received signals of the detection device 230 unless or until the detection unit 218 is instructed
that the control unit 206 is causing the injection of the examination signal into the route 108.
Alternatively or additionally, the detection unit 218 may periodically monitor the detection
device 230 for received signals and/or may monitor the detection device 230 for received
signals upon being manually prompted by an operator of the examining system 200.
[0067]      The identification unit 220 receives the characteristics of the received signal from
the detection unit 218 and determines if the characteristics indicate receipt of all or a portion
of the examination signal injected into the route 108 by the first vehicle 202. Although the
detection unit 218 and the identification unit 220 are shown as separate units, the detection
unit 218 and the identification unit 220 may refer to the same unit.           For example, the
detection unit 218 and the identification unit 220 may be a single hardware component
disposed onboard the second vehicle 204.
[0068]      The identification unit 220 examines the characteristics and determines if the
characteristics indicate that the section of the route 108 disposed between the first vehicle 202
and the second vehicle 204 is damaged or at least partially damaged. For example, if the
application device 210 injected the examination signal into a track of the route 108 and one or
                                                  16

more characteristics (e.g., voltage, current, frequency, intensity, signal-to-noise ratio, and the
like) of the examination signal are not detected by the detection unit 218, then, the
identification unit 220 may determine that the section of the track that was disposed between
the vehicles 202, 204 is broken or otherwise damaged such that the track cannot conduct the
examination signal. Additionally or alternatively, the identification unit 220 can examine the
signal-to-noise ratio of the signal detected by the detection unit 218 and determine if the
section of the route 108 between the vehicles 202, 204 is potentially broken or damaged. For
example, the identification unit 220 may identify this section of the route 108 as being broken
or damaged if the signal-to-noise ratio of one or more (or at least a designated amount) of the
received signals is less than a designated ratio.
[0069]       The identification unit 220 may include or be communicatively coupled (e.g., by
one or more wired and/or wireless connections that allow communication) with a location
determining unit that can determine the location of the vehicle 204 and/or vehicle system.
For example, the location determining unit may include a GPS unit or other device that can
determine where the first vehicle and/or second vehicle are located along the route 108. The
distance between the first vehicle 202 and the second vehicle 204 along the length of the
vehicle system may be known to the identification unit 220, such as by inputting the distance
into the identification unit 220 using one or more input devices and/or via the communication
unit 222.
[0070]       The identification unit 220 can identify which section of the route 108 is
potentially damaged based on the location of the first vehicle 202 and/or the second vehicle
204 during transmission of the examination signal through the route 108. For example, the
identification unit 220 can identify the section of the route 108 that is within a designated
distance of the vehicle system, the first vehicle 202, and/or the second vehicle 204 as the
potentially damaged section when the identification unit 220 determines that the examination
signal is not received or at least has a decreased signal-to-noise ratio.
[0071]       Additionally or alternatively, the identification unit 220 can identify which section
of the route 108 is potentially damaged based on the locations of the first vehicle 202 and the
second vehicle 204 during transmission of the examination signal through the route 108, the
direction of travel of the vehicle system that includes the vehicles 202, 204, the speed of the
vehicle system, and/or a speed of propagation of the examination signal through the route
108. The speed of propagation of the examination signal may be a designated speed that is
                                                 17

based on one or more of the material(s) from which the route 108 is formed, the type of
examination signal that is injected into the route 108, and the like. In an embodiment, the
identification unit 220 may be notified when the examination signal is injected into the route
108 via the notification provided by the control unit 206. The identification unit 220 can then
determine which portion of the route 108 is disposed between the first vehicle 202 and the
second vehicle 204 as the vehicle system moves along the route 108 during the time period
that corresponds to when the examination signal is expected to be propagating through the
route 108 between the vehicles 202, 204 as the vehicles 202, 204 move. This portion of the
route 108 may be the section of potentially damaged route that is identified.
[0072]       One or more responsive actions may be initiated when the potentially damaged
section of the route 108 is identified. For example, in response to identifying the potentially
damaged portion of the route 108, the identification unit 220 may notify the control unit 206
via the communication units 222, 216. The control unit 206 and/or the identification unit 220
can automatically slow down or stop movement of the vehicle system. For example, the
control unit 206 and/or identification unit 220 can be communicatively coupled with one or
more propulsion systems (e.g., engines, alternators/generators, motors, and the like) of one or
more of the propulsion-generating vehicles in the vehicle system.          The control unit 206
and/or identification unit 220 may automatically direct the propulsion systems to slow down
and/or stop.
[0073]       With continued reference to Figure 2, Figure 3 illustrates a schematic diagram of
an embodiment of plural vehicle systems 300, 302 traveling along the route 108. One or
more of the vehicle systems 300, 302 may represent the vehicle system 100 shown in Figure
1 that includes the route examining system 200. For example, at least a first vehicle system
300 traveling along the route 108 in a first direction 308 may include the examining system
200. The second vehicle system 302 may be following the first vehicle system 300 on the
route 108, but spaced apart and separated from the first vehicle system 300.
[0074]       In addition or as an alternate to the responsive actions that may be taken when a
potentially damaged section of the route 108 is identified, the examining system 200 onboard
the first vehicle system 300 may automatically notify the second vehicle system 302. The
control unit 206 and/or the identification unit 220 may wirelessly communicate (e.g., transmit
or broadcast) a warning signal to the second vehicle system 302. The warning signal may
notify the second vehicle system 302 of the location of the potentially damaged section of the

route 108 before the second vehicle system 302 arrives at the potentially damaged section.
The second vehicle system 302 may be able to slow down, stop, or move to another route to
avoid traveling over the potentially damaged section.
[0075]      Additionally or alternatively, the control unit 206 and/or identification unit 220
may communicate a warning signal to a stationary wayside device 304 in response to
identifying a section of the route 108 as being potentially damaged. The device 304 can be,
for instance, wayside equipment, an electrical device, a client asset, a defect detection device,
a device utilized with Positive Train Control (PTC), a signal system component(s), a device
utilized with Automated Equipment Identification (AEI), among others. In one example, the
device 304 can be a device utilized with AEI. AEI is an automated equipment identification
mechanism that can aggregate data related to equipment for the vehicle. By way of example
and not limitation, AEI can utilize passive radio frequency technology in which a tag (e.g.,
passive tag) is associated with the vehicle and a reader/receiver receives data from the tag
when in geographic proximity thereto.       The AEI device can be a reader or receiver that
collects or stores data from a passive tag, a data store that stores data related to passive tag
information received from a vehicle, an antenna that facilitates communication between the
vehicle and a passive tag, among others.      Such an AEI device may store an indication of
where the potentially damaged section of the route 108 is located so that the second vehicle
system 302 may obtain this indication when the second vehicle system 302 reads information
from the AEI device.
[0076]      In another example, the device 304 can be a signaling device for the vehicle. For
instance, the device 304 can provide visual and/or audible warnings to provide warning to
other entities such as other vehicle systems (e.g., the vehicle system 302) of the potentially
damaged section of the route 108. The signaling devices can be, but not limited to, a light, a
motorized gate arm (e.g., motorized motion in a vertical plane), an audible warning device,
among others.
[0077]      In another example, the device 304 can be utilized with PTC. PTC can refer to
communication-based/processor-based      vehicle control technology that provides a system
capable of reliably and functionally preventing collisions between vehicle systems, over
speed derailments, incursions into established work zone limits, and the movement of a
vehicle system through a route switch in the improper position. PTC systems can perform
other additional specified functions. Such a PTC device 304 can provide warnings to the
                                               10Q

second vehicle system 204 that cause the second vehicle system 204 to automatically slow
and/or stop, among other responsive actions, when the second vehicle system 204 approaches
the location of the potentially damaged section of the route 108.
[0078]      In another example, the wayside device 304 can act as a beacon or other
transmitting or broadcasting device other than a PTC device that communicates warnings to
other vehicles or vehicle systems traveling on the route 108 of the identified section of the
route 108 that is potentially damaged.
[0079]      The control unit 206 and/or identification unit 220 may communicate a repair
signal to an off-board facility 306 in response to identifying a section of the route 108 as
being potentially damaged. The facility 306 can represent a location, such as a dispatch or
repair center, that is located off-board of the vehicle systems 202, 204. The repair signal may
include or represent a request for further inspection and/or repair of the route 108 at the
potentially damaged section. Upon receipt of the repair signal, the facility 306 may dispatch
one or more persons and/or equipment to the location of the potentially damaged section of
the route 108 in order to inspect and/or repair the route 108 at the location.
[0080]      Additionally or alternatively, the control unit 206 and/or identification unit 220
may notify an operator of the vehicle system of the potentially damaged section of the route
108 and suggest the operator initiate one or more of the responsive actions described herein.
[0081]      In another embodiment, the examining system 200 may identify the potentially
damaged section of the route 108 using the wayside device 304. For example, the detection
device 230, the detection unit 218, and the communication unit 222 may be located at or
included in the wayside device 304.         The control unit 206 on the vehicle system may
determine when the vehicle system is within a designated distance of the wayside device 304
based on an input or known location of the wayside device 304 and the monitored location of
the vehicle system (e.g., from data obtained from a location determination unit).           Upon
traveling within a designated distance of the wayside device 304, the control unit 206 may
cause the examination signal to be injected into the route 108. The wayside device 304 can
monitor one or more electrical characteristics of the route 108 similar to the second vehicle
204 described above. If the electrical characteristics indicate that the section of the route 108
between the vehicle system and the wayside device 304 is damaged or broken, the wayside
device 304 can initiate one or more responsive actions, such as by directing the vehicle
                                                 20

system to automatically slow down and/or stop, warning other vehicle systems traveling on
the route 108, requesting inspection and/or repair of the potentially damaged section of the
route 108, and the like.
[0082]       Figure 5 is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of an examining system 500.
The examining system 500 may represent the examining system 102 shown in Figure 1. In
contrast to the examining system 200 shown in Figure 2, the examining system 500 is
disposed within a single vehicle 502 in a vehicle system that may include one or more
additional vehicles mechanically coupled with the vehicle 502.           The vehicle 502 may
represent a vehicle 104 and/or 106 of the vehicle system 100 shown in Figure 1.
[0083]       The examining system 500 includes an identification unit 520 and a signal
communication system 521. The identification unit 520 may be similar to or represent the
identification unit 220 shown in Figure 2. The signal communication system 521 includes at
least one application device and at least one detection device and/or unit. In the illustrated
embodiment, the signal communication system 521 includes one application device 510 and
one detection device 530. The application device 510 and the detection device 530 may be
similar to or represent the application device 210 and the detection device 230, respectively
(both shown in Figure 2). The application device 510 and the detection device 530 may be a
pair of transmit and receive coils in different, discrete housings that are spaced apart from
each other, as shown in Figure 5. Alternatively, the application device 510 and the detection
device 530 may be a pair of transmit and receive coils held in a common housing. In another
alternative embodiment, the application device 510 and the detection device 530 include a
same coil, where the coil is configured to inject at least one examination signal into the route
108 and is also configured to monitor one or more electrical characteristics of the route 108 in
response to the injection of the at least one examination signal.
[0084]       In other embodiments shown and described below, the signal communication
system 521 may include two or more application devices and/or two or more detection
devices or units. Although not indicated in Figure 5, in addition to the application device 510
and the detection device 530, the signal communication system 521 may further include one
or more switches 524 (which may be similar to or represent the switches 224 shown in Figure
2), a control unit 506 (which may be similar to or represent the control unit 208 shown in
Figure 2), one or more conditioning circuits 514 (which may be similar to or represent the
circuits 214 shown in Figure 2), an onboard power source 512 ("Battery" in Figure 5, which
                                                 21

may be similar to or represent the power source 212 shown in Figure 2), and/or one or more
detection units 518 (which may be similar to or represent the detection unit 218 shown in
Figure 2).The illustrated embodiment of the examining system 500 may further include a
communication unit 516 (which may be similar to or represent the communication unit 216
shown in Figure 2). As shown in Figure 5, these components of the examining system 500
are disposed onboard a single vehicle 502 of a vehicle system, although one or more of the
components may be disposed onboard a different vehicle of the vehicle system from other
components of the examining system 500.As described above, the control unit 506 controls
supply of electric current to the application device 510 that engages or is inductively coupled
with the route 108 as the vehicle 502 travels along the route 108. The application device 510
is conductively coupled with the switch 524 that is controlled by the control unit 506 so that
the control unit 506 can turn on or off the flow of electric current through the application
device 510 to the route 108. The power source 512 is coupled with the switch 524 so that the
control unit 506 can control when the electric energy stored in the power source 512 and/or
the electric current generated by the power source 512 is conveyed as electric current to the
route 108 via the application device 510.
[0085]      The conditioning circuit 514 may be coupled with a connecting assembly 526 that
is similar to or represents the connecting assembly 226 shown in Figure 2. The connecting
assembly 526 receives electric current from an off-board source, such as the electrified
conductive pathway 228. Electric current can be conveyed from the electrified portion of the
route 108 through the connecting assembly 526 and to the conditioning circuit 514.
[0086]      The electric current that is conveyed to the conditioning circuit 514 from the
power source 512 and/or the off-board source can be altered by the conditioning circuit 514.
The modified current can be the examination signal that is electrically injected into the route
108 by the application device 510. Optionally, the control unit 506 can form the examination
signal by controlling the switch 524, as described above. Optionally, the control unit 506
may control the conditioning circuit 514 to form the examination signal, also as described
above.
[0087]      The examination signal is conducted through the application device 510 to the
route 108, and is electrically injected into a conductive portion of the route 108.        The
conductive portion of the route 108 that extends between the application device 510 and the

detection device 530 of the vehicle 502 during travel may form a track circuit through which
the examination signal may be conducted.
[0088]      The control unit 506 may include or represent a manager component.            Such a
manager component can be configured to activate a transmission of electric current into the
route 108 via the application device 510. In another instance, the manager component can
activate or deactivate a transfer of the portion of power from the onboard and/or off-board
power source to the application device 510, such as by controlling the switch and/or
conditioning circuit. Moreover, the manager component can adjust parameter(s) associated
with the portion of power that is transferred to the route 108.
[0089]      The detection unit 518 monitors the route 108 to attempt to detect the examination
signal that is injected into the route 108 by the application device 510. In one aspect, the
detection unit 518 may follow behind the application device 510 along a direction of travel of
the vehicle 502. The detection unit 518 is coupled with the detection device 530 that engages
or is inductively coupled with the route 108, as described above.
[0090]      The detection unit 518 monitors one or more electrical characteristics of the route
108 using the detection device 530. The detection unit 518 may compare the received signal
that is conducted from the route 108 into the detection device 530 with this designated signal
in order to measure a signal-to-noise ratio of the received signal.      The detection unit 518
determines one or more electrical characteristics of the signal by the detection device 530
from the route 108 and reports the characteristics of the received signal to the identification
unit 520. If no signal is received by the detection device 530, then the detection unit 518 may
report the absence of such a signal to the identification unit 520.      In an embodiment, the
detection unit 518 may determine the characteristics of the signals received by the detection
device 530 in response to a notification received from the control unit 506, as described
above.
[0091]      The detection unit 518 may begin monitoring signals received by the detection
device 530. For example, the detection unit 518 may not begin or resume monitoring the
received signals of the detection device 530 unless or until the detection unit 518 is instructed
that the control unit 506 is causing the injection of the examination signal into the route 108.
Alternatively or additionally, the detection unit 518 may periodically monitor the detection
                                                ?'I

device 530 for received signals and/or may monitor the detection device 530 for received
signals upon being manually prompted by an operator of the examining system 500.
[0092]       In one aspect, the application device 510 includes a first axle 528 and/or a first
wheel 530 that is connected to the axle 528 of the vehicle 502. The axle 528 and wheel 530
may be connected to a first truck 532 of the vehicle 502. The application device 510 may be
conductively coupled with the route 108 (e.g., by directly engaging the route 108) to inject
the examination signal into the route 108 via the axle 528 and the wheel 530, or via the wheel
530 alone. The detection device 530 may include a second axle 534 and/or a second wheel
536 that is connected to the axle 534 of the vehicle 502. The axle 534 and wheel 536 may be
connected to a second truck 538 of the vehicle 502. The detection device 530 may monitor
the electrical characteristics of the route 108 via the axle 534 and the wheel 536, or via the
wheel 536 alone. Optionally, the axle 534 and/or wheel 536 may inject the signal while the
other axle 528 and/or wheel 530 monitors the electrical characteristics.
[0093]       The identification unit 520 receives the one or more characteristics of the received
signal from the detection unit 518 and determines if the characteristics indicate receipt of all
or a portion of the examination signal injected into the route 108 by the application device
510. The identification unit 520 interprets the one or more characteristics monitored by the
detection unit 518 to determine a state of the route. The identification unit 520 examines the
characteristics and determines if the characteristics indicate that a test section of the route 108
disposed between the application device 510 and the detection device 530 is in a non
damaged state, is in a damaged or at least partially damaged state, or is in a non-damaged
state that indicates the presence of an electrical short, as described below.
[0094]       The identification unit 520 may include or be communicatively coupled with a
location determining unit that can determine the location of the vehicle 502. The distance
between the application device 510 and the detection device 530 along the length of the
vehicle 502 may be known to the identification unit 520, such as by inputting the distance
into the identification unit 520 using one or more input devices and/or via the communication
unit 516.
[0095]       The identification unit 520 can identify which section of the route 108 is
potentially damaged based on the location of the vehicle 502 during transmission of the
examination signal through the route 108, the direction of travel of the vehicle 502, the speed
                                                 24

of the vehicle 502, and/or a speed of propagation of the examination signal through the route
108, as described above.
[0096]      One or more responsive actions may be initiated when the potentially damaged
section of the route 108 is identified. For example, in response to identifying the potentially
damaged portion of the route 108, the identification unit 520 may notify the control unit 506.
The control unit 506 and/or the identification unit 520 can automatically slow down or stop
movement of the vehicle 502 and/or the vehicle system that includes the vehicle 502. For
example, the control unit 506 and/or identification unit 520 can be communicatively coupled
with one or more propulsion systems (e.g., engines, alternators/generators, motors, and the
like) of one or more of the propulsion-generating vehicles in the vehicle system. The control
unit 506 and/or identification unit 520 may automatically direct the propulsion systems to
slow down and/or stop.
[0097]      Figure 4 is a flowchart of an embodiment of a method 400 for examining a route
being traveled by a vehicle system from onboard the vehicle system. The method 400 may
be used in conjunction with one or more embodiments of the vehicle systems and/or
examining systems described herein. Alternatively, the method 400 may be implemented
with another system.
[0098]      At 402, an examination signal is injected into the route being traveled by the
vehicle system at a first vehicle. For example, a direct current, alternating current, RF signal,
or another signal may be conductively and/or inductively injected into a conductive portion
of the route 108, such as a track of the route 108.
[0099]      At 404, one or more electrical characteristics of the route are monitored at
another, second vehicle in the same vehicle system. For example, the route 108 may be
monitored to determine if any voltage or current is being conducted by the route 108.
[00100]     At 406, a determination is made as to whether the one or more monitored
electrical characteristics indicate receipt of the examination signal. For example, if a direct
current, alternating current, or RF signal is detected in the route 108, then the detected current
or signal may indicate that the examination signal is conducted through the route 108 from
the first vehicle to the second vehicle in the same vehicle system. As a result, the route 108
may be substantially intact between the first and second vehicles.                Optionally, the
examination signal may be conducted through the route 108 between components joined to
                                                 25r

the same vehicle.      As a result, the route 108 may be substantially intact between the
components of the same vehicle. Flow of the method 400 may proceed to 408. On the other
hand, if no direct current, alternating current, or RF signal is detected in the route 108, then
the absence of the current or signal may indicate that the examination signal is not conducted
through the route 108 from the first vehicle to the second vehicle in the same vehicle system
or between components of the same vehicle.          As a result, the route 108 may be broken
between the first and second vehicles, or between the components of the same vehicle. Flow
of the method 400 may then proceed to 412.
[00101]     At 408, a determination is made as to whether a change in the one or more
monitored electrical characteristics indicates damage to the route. For example, a change in
the examination signal between when the signal was injected into the route 108 and when the
examination signal is detected may be determined.          This change may reflect a decrease in
voltage, a decrease in current, a change in frequency and/or phase, a decrease in a signal-to
noise ratio, or the like. The change can indicate that the examination signal was conducted
through the route 108, but that damage to the route 108 may have altered the signal. For
example, if the change in voltage, current, frequency, phase, signal-to-noise ratio, or the like,
of the injected examination signal to the detected examination signal exceeds a designated
threshold amount (or if the monitored characteristic decreased below a designated threshold),
then the change may indicate damage to the route 108, but not a complete break in the route
108. As a result, flow of the method 400 can proceed to 412.
[00102]     On the other hand, if the change in voltage, amps, frequency, phase, signal-to
noise ratio, or the like, of the injected examination signal to the detected examination signal
does not exceed the designated threshold amount (and/or if the monitored characteristic does
not decrease below a designated threshold), then the change may not indicate damage to the
route 108. As a result, flow of the method 400 can proceed to 410.
[00103]     At 410, the test section of the route that is between the first and second vehicles in
the vehicle system or between the components of the same vehicle is not identified as
potentially damaged, and the vehicle system may continue to travel along the route.
Additionally examination signals may be injected into the route at other locations as the
vehicle system moves along the route.

[00104]      At 412, the section of the route that is or was disposed between the first and
second vehicles, or between the components of the same vehicle, is identified as a potentially
damaged section of the route. For example, due to the failure of the examination signal to be
detected and/or the change in the examination signal that is detected, the route may be broken
and/or damaged between the first vehicle and the second vehicle, or between the components
of the same vehicle.
[00105]      At 414, one or more responsive actions may be initiated in response to identifying
the potentially damaged section of the route. As described above, these actions can include,
but are not limited to, automatically and/or manually slowing or stopping movement of the
vehicle system, warning other vehicle systems about the potentially damaged section of the
route, notifying wayside devices of the potentially damaged section of the route, requesting
inspection and/or repair of the potentially damaged section of the route, and the like.
[00106]      In one or more embodiments, a route examining system and method may be used
to identify electrical shorts, or short circuits, on a route. The identification of short circuits
may allow for the differentiation of a short circuit on a non-damaged section of the route
from a broken or deteriorated track on a damaged section of the route. The differentiation of
short circuits from open circuits caused by various types of damage to the route provides
identification of false alarms. Detecting a false alarm preserves the time and costs associated
with attempting to locate and repair a section of the route that is not actually damaged. For
example, referring to the method 400 above at 408, a change in the monitored electrical
characteristics may indicate that the test section of the route includes an electrical short that
short circuits the two tracks together. For example, an increase in the amplitude of monitored
voltage or current and/or a phase shift may indicate the presence of an electrical short. The
electrical short provides a circuit path between the two tracks, which effectively reduces the
circuit path of the propagating examination signal between the point of injection and the
place of detection, which results in an increased voltage and/or current and/or the phase shift.
[00107]      Figure 6 is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of an examining system 600
on a vehicle 602 of a vehicle system (not shown) traveling along a route 604. The examining
system 600 may represent the examining system 102 shown in Figure 1 and/or the examining
system 200 shown in Figure 2.        In contrast to the examining system 200, the examining
system 600 is disposed within a single vehicle 602. The vehicle 602 may represent at least
one of the vehicles 104, 106 of the vehicle system 100 shown in Figure 1. Figure 6 may be a
                                                  27

top-down view looking at least partially through the vehicle 602. The examining system 600
may be utilized to identify short circuits and breaks on a route, such as a railway track, for
example.    The vehicle 602 may be one of multiple vehicles of the vehicle system, so the
vehicle 602 may be referred to herein as a first vehicle 602.
[00108]     The vehicle 602 includes multiple transmitters or application devices 606 disposed
onboard the vehicle 602.     The application devices 606 may be positioned at spaced apart
locations along the length of the vehicle 602. For example, a first application device 606A
may be located closer to a front end 608 of the vehicle 602 relative to a second application
device 606B located closer to a rear end 610 of the vehicle 602. The designations of "front"
and "rear" may be based on the direction of travel 612 of the vehicle 602 along the route 604.
[00109]     The route 604 includes conductive rails 614 in parallel, and the application
devices 606 are configured to be conductively and/or inductively coupled with at least one
conductive rail 614 along the route 604. For example, the conductive rails 614 may be rails
in a railway context. In an embodiment, the first application device 606A is configured to be
conductively and/or inductively coupled with a first conductive rail 614A, and the second
application device 606B is configured to be conductively and/or inductively coupled with a
second conductive rail 614B. As such, the application devices 606 may be disposed on the
vehicle 602 diagonally from each other.         The application devices 606 are utilized to
electrically inject at least one examination signal into the route.     For example, the first
application device 606A may be used to inject a first examination signal into the first
conductive rail 614A of the route 604. Likewise, the second application device 606B may be
used to inject a second examination signal into the second conductive rail 614B of the route
604.
[00110]     The vehicle 602 also includes multiple receiver coils or detection units 616
disposed onboard the vehicle 602. The detection units 616 are positioned at spaced apart
locations along the length of the vehicle 602. For example, a first detection unit 616A may
be located towards the front end 608 of the vehicle 602 relative to a second detection unit
616B located closer to the rear end 610 of the vehicle 602.       The detection units 616 are
configured to monitor one or more electrical characteristics of the route 604 along the
conductive rails 614 in response to the examination signals being injected into the route 604.
The electrical characteristics that are monitored may include a current, a phase shift, a
modulation, a frequency, a voltage, an impedance, and the like.         For example, the first

detection unit 616A may be configured to monitor one or more electrical characteristics of
the route 604 along the second rail 614B, and the second detection unit 616B may be
configured to monitor one or more electrical characteristics of the route 604 along the first
rail 614A. As such, the detection units 616 may be disposed on the vehicle 602 diagonally
from each other. In an embodiment, each of the application devices 606A, 606B and the
detection units 616A, 616B may define individual comers of a test section of the vehicle 602.
Optionally, the application devices 606 and/or the detection units 616 may be staggered in
location along the length and/or width of the vehicle 602. Optionally, the application device
606A and detection unit 616A and/or the application device 606B and detection unit 616B
may be disposed along the same rail 614. The application devices 606 and/or detection units
616 may be disposed on the vehicle 602 at other locations in other embodiments.
[00111]     In an embodiment, two of the conductive rails 614 (e.g., rails 614A and 614B)
may be conductively and/or inductively coupled to each other through multiple shunts 618
along the length of the vehicle 602. For example, the vehicle 602 may include two shunts
618, with one shunt 618A located closer to the front 608 of the vehicle 602 relative to the
other shunt 618B. In an embodiment, the shunts 618 are conductive and together with the
rails 614 define an electrically conductive test loop 620.       The conductive test loop 620
represents a track circuit or circuit path along the conductive rails 614 between the shunts
618. The test loop 620 moves along the rails 614 as the vehicle 602 travels along the route
604 in the direction 612. Therefore, the section of the conductive rails 614 defining part of
the conductive test loop 620 changes as the vehicle 602 progresses on a trip along the route
604.
[00112]     In an embodiment, the application devices 606 and the detection units 616 are in
electrical contact with the conductive test loop 620.     For example, the application device
606A may be in electrical contact with rail 614A and/or shunt 618A; the application device
606B may be in electrical contact with rail 614B and/or shunt 618B; the detection unit 616A
may be in electrical contact with rail 614B and/or shunt 618A; and the detection unit 616B
may be in electrical contact with rail 614A and/or shunt 618B.
[00113]     The two shunts 618A, 618B may be first and second trucks disposed on a rail
vehicle. Each truck 618 includes an axle 622 interconnecting two wheels 624. Each wheel
624 contacts a respective one of the rails 614. The wheels 624 and the axle 622 of each of
the trucks 618 are configured to electrically connect (e.g., short) the two rails 614A, 614B to
                                               20)

define respective ends of the conductive test loop 620. For example, the injected first and
second examination signals may circulate the conductive test loop 620 along the length of a
section of the first rail 614A, through the wheels 624 and axle 622 of the shunt 618A to the
second rail 614B, along a section of the second rail 614B, and across the shunt 618B,
returning to the first rail 614A.
[00114]     In an embodiment, alternating current transmitted from the vehicle 602 is injected
into the route 604 at two or more points through the rails 614 and received at different
locations on the vehicle 602. For example, the first and second application devices 606A,
606B may be used to inject the first and second examination signals into respective first and
second rails 614A, 614B. One or more electrical characteristics in response to the injected
examination signals may be received at the first and second detection units 616A, 616B.
Each examination signal may have a unique identifier so the signals can be distinguished
from each other at the detection units 616. For example, the unique identifier of the first
examination signal may have a base frequency, a phase, a modulation, an embedded
signature, and/or the like, that differs from the unique identifier of the second examination
signal.
[00115]     In an embodiment, the examining system 600 may be used to more precisely
locate faults on track circuits in railway signaling systems, and to differentiate between track
features. For example, the system 600 may be used to distinguish broken tracks (e.g., rails)
versus crossing shunt devices, non-insulated switches, scrap metal connected across the rails
614A and 614B, and other situations or devices that might produce an electrical short (e.g.,
short circuit) when a current is applied to the conductive rails 614 along the route 604. In
typical track circuits looking for damaged sections of routes, an electrical short may appear as
similar to a break, creating a false alarm. The examining system 600 also may be configured
to distinguish breaks in the route due to damage from intentional, non-damaged "breaks" in
the route, such as insulated joints and turnouts (e.g., track switches), which simulate actual
breaks but do not short the conductive test loop 620 when traversed by a vehicle system
having the examining system 600.
[00116]     In an embodiment, when there is no break or short circuit on the route 604 and the
rails 614 are electrically contiguous, the injected examination signals circulate the length of
the test loop 620 and are received by all detection units 616 present on the test loop 620.
Therefore, both detection units 616A and 616B receive both the first and second examination
                                                'in

signals when there is no electrical break or electrical short on the route 604 within the section
of the route 604 defining the test loop 620.
[00117]     As discussed further below, when the vehicle 602 passes over an electrical short
(e.g., a device or a condition of a section of the route 604 that causes a short circuit when a
current is applied along the section of the route 604), two additional conductive current loops
or conductive short loops are formed.        The two additional conductive short loops have
electrical characteristics that are unique to a short circuit (e.g., as opposed to electrical
characteristics of an open circuit caused by a break in a rail 614). For example, the electrical
characteristics of the current circulating the first conductive short loop may have an
amplitude that is an inverse derivative of the amplitude of the second additional current loop
as the electrical short is traversed by the vehicle 602.       In addition, the amplitude of the
current along the original conductive test loop 620 spanning the periphery of the test section
diminishes considerably while the vehicle 602 traverses the electrical short. All of the one or
more electrical characteristics in the original and additional current loops may be received
and/or monitored by the detection units 616.         Sensing the two additional short loops may
provide a clear differentiator to identify that the loss of current in the original test loop is the
result of a short circuit and not an electrical break in the rail 614. Analysis of the electrical
characteristics of the additional short loops relative to the vehicle motion and/or location may
provide more precision in locating the short circuit within the span of the test section.
[00118]     In an alternative embodiment, the examining system 600 includes the two spaced
apart detection units 616A, 616B defining a test section of the route 604 therebetween, but
only includes one of the application devices 606A, 606B, such as only the first application
device 606A. The detection units 616A, 616B are each configured to monitor one or more
electrical characteristics of at least one of the conductive rails 614A, 614B proximate to the
respective detection unit 616A, 616B in response to at least one examination signal being
electrically injected into at least one of the conductive rails 614A, 614B by the application
device 606A. In another alternative embodiment, the examining system 600 includes the two
spaced-apart detection units 616A, 616B, but does not include either of the application
devices 606A, 606B. For example, the examination signal may be derived from an inherent
electrical current of a traction motor (not shown) of the vehicle 602 (or another vehicle of the
vehicle system). The examination signal may be injected into at least one of the conductive
rails 614A, 614B via a conductive and/or inductive electrical connection between the traction
                                                 311

motor and the one or both conductive rails 614A, 614B, such as a conductive connection
through the wheels 624. In other embodiments, the examination signal may be derived from
electrical currents of other motors of the vehicle 602 or may be an electrical current injected
into the rails 614 from a wayside device.
[00119]      Regardless of whether the examining system 600 includes one application device
or no application devices, the identification unit 520 (shown in Figure 5) is configured to
examine the one or more electrical characteristics monitored by each of the first and second
detection units 616A, 616B in order to determine a status of the test section of the route 604
based on whether the one or more electrical characteristics indicate that the examination
signal is received by both the first and second detection units 616A, 616B, neither of the first
or second detection units 616A, 616B, or only one of the first or second detection units 616A,
616B.     The status of the test section may be potentially damaged, neither damaged nor
includes an electrical short, or not damaged and includes an electrical short. The status of the
test section is potentially damaged when neither of the first or second detection units 616A,
616B receive the examination signal, indicating an open circuit loop 620. The status of the
test section is neither damaged nor includes an electrical short when both of the first and
second detection units 616A, 616B receive the examination signal, indicating a closed circuit
loop 620. The status of the test section is not damaged and includes an electrical short when
only one of the first or second detection units 616A, 616B receive the examination signal,
indicating one open sub-loop and one closed sub-loop within the loop 620.
[00120]      In an alternative embodiment, the vehicle 602 includes the two spaced-apart
application devices 606A, 606B defining a test section of the route 604 therebetween, but
only includes one of the detection units 616A, 616B, such as only the first detection unit
616A.    The first and second application devices 606A, 606B are configured to electrically
inject the first and second examination signals, respectively, into the corresponding
conductive rails 614A, 614B that the application devices 606A, 606B are coupled to. The
detection unit 616A is configured to monitor one or more electrical characteristics of at least
one of the conductive rails 614A, 614B in response to the first and second examination
signals being injected into the rails 614.
[00121]      In this embodiment, the identification unit 520 (shown in Figure 5) is configured
to examine the one or more electrical characteristics monitored by the detection unit 616A in
order to determine a status of the test section of the route 604 based on whether the one or
                                               1?

more electrical characteristics indicate receipt by the detection unit 616A of both of the first
and second examination signals, neither of the first or second examination signals, or only
one of the first or second examination signals.      The status of the test section is potentially
damaged when the one or more electrical characteristics indicate receipt by the detection unit
616A of neither the first nor the second examination signals, indicating an open circuit loop
620. The status of the test section is neither damaged nor includes an electrical short when
the one or more electrical characteristics indicate receipt by the detection unit 616A of both
the first and second examination signals, indicating a closed circuit loop 620. The status of
the test section is not damaged and includes an electrical short when the one or more
electrical characteristics indicate receipt by the detection unit 616A of only one of the first or
second examination signals, indicating one open circuit sub-loop and one closed circuit sub
loop within the loop 620.
[00122]     Additionally, or alternatively, the identification unit 520 may be configured to
determine that the test section of the route 604 includes an electrical short by detecting a
change in a phase difference between the first and second examination signals. For example,
the identification unit 520 may compare a detected phase difference between the first and
second examination signals that is detected by the detection unit 616A to a known phase
difference between the first and second examination signals.        The known phase difference
may be a phase difference between the examination signals upon injecting the signals into the
route 604 or may be a detected phase difference between the examination signals along
sections of the route that are known to be not damaged and free of electrical shorts. Thus, if
the one of more electrical characteristics monitored by the detection unit 616A indicate that
the phase difference between the first and second examination signals is similar to the known
phase difference, such that the change in phase difference is negligible or within a threshold
value that compensates for variations due to noise, etc., then the status of the test section of
route 604 may be non-damaged and free of an electrical short.             If the detected phase
difference varies from the known phase difference by more than the designated threshold
value (such that the change in phase difference exceeds the designated threshold), the status
of the test section of route 604 may be non-damaged and includes an electrical short. If the
test section of the route 604 is potentially damaged, the one or more monitored electrical
characteristics may indicate that the examination signals were not received by the detection
unit 616A, so phase difference between the first and second examination signals is not
detected.

[00123]      In another alternative embodiment, the vehicle 602 includes one application
device, such as the application device 606A, and one detection unit, such as the detection unit
616A. The application device 606A is disposed proximate to the detection unit 616A. For
example, the application device 606A and the detection unit 616A may be located on
opposite rails 614A, 614B at similar positions along the length of the vehicle 602 between the
two shunts 618, as shown in Figure 6, or may be located on the same rail 614A or 614B
proximate to each other. The application device 606A is configured to electrically inject at
least one examination signal into the rails 614, and the detection unit 616A is configured to
monitor one or more electrical characteristics of the rails 614 in response to the at least one
examination signal being injected into the conductive test loop 620.
[00124]      In this embodiment, the identification unit 520 (shown in Figure 5) is configured
to examine the one or more electrical characteristics monitored by the detection unit 616A to
determine a status of a test section of the route 604 that extends between the shunts 618. The
identification unit 520 is configured to determine that the status of the test section is
potentially damaged when the one or more electrical characteristics indicate that the at least
one examination signal is not received by the detection unit 616A.       The status of the test
section is neither damaged nor includes an electrical short when the one or more electrical
characteristics indicate that the at least one examination signal is received by the detection
unit 616A. The status of the test section is not damaged and does include an electrical short
when the one or more electrical characteristics indicate at least one of a phase shift in the at
least one examination signal or an increased amplitude of the at least one examination signal.
The amplitude may be increased over a base line amplitude that is detected or measured when
the status of the test section is not damaged and does not include an electrical short. The
increased amplitude may gradually increase from the base line amplitude, such as when the
detection unit 616A and application device 606A of the signal communication system 521
(shown in Figure 5) move towards the electrical short in the route 604, and may gradually
decrease towards the base line amplitude, such as when the detection unit 616A and
application device 606A of the signal communication system 521 move away from the
electrical short.
[00125]      Figure 7 is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of an examining system 700
disposed on multiple vehicles 702 of a vehicle system 704 traveling along a route 706. The
examining system 700 may represent the examining system 600 shown in Figure 6.                In
                                                 314

contrast to the examining system 600 shown in Figure 6, the examining system 700 is
disposed on multiple vehicles 702 in the vehicle system 704, where the vehicles 702 are
mechanically coupled together.
[00126]     In an embodiment, the examining system 700 includes a first application device
708A configured to be disposed on a first vehicle 702A of the vehicle system 702, and a
second application device 708B configured to be disposed on a second vehicle 702B of the
vehicle system 702.      The application devices 708A, 708B may be conductively and/or
inductively coupled with different conductive tracks 712, such that the application devices
708A, 708B are disposed diagonally along the vehicle system 704.         The first and second
vehicles 702A and 702B may be directly coupled, or may be indirectly coupled, having one
or more additional vehicles coupled in between the vehicles 702A, 702B.         Optionally the
vehicles 702A, 702B may each be either one of the vehicles 104 or 106 shown in Figure 1.
Optionally, the second vehicle 702B may trail the first vehicle 702A during travel of the
vehicle system 704 along the route 706.
[00127]     The examining system 700 also includes a first detection unit 710A configured to
be disposed on the first vehicle 702A of the vehicle system 702, and a second detection unit
710B configured to be disposed on the second vehicle 702B of the vehicle system 702. The
first and second detection units 710A, 710B may be configured to monitor electrical
characteristics of the route 706 along different conductive tracks 712, such that the detection
units 710 are oriented diagonally along the vehicle system 704. The location of the first
application device 708A and/or first detection unit 710A along the length of the first vehicle
702A is optional, as well as the location of the second application device 708B and/or second
detection unit 710B along the length of the second vehicle 702B. However, the location of
the application devices 708A, 708B affects the length of a current loop that defines a test loop
714. For example, the test loop 714 spans a greater length of the route 706 than the test loop
620 shown in Figure 6. Increasing the length of the test loop 714 may increase the amount of
signal loss as the electrical examination signals are diverted along alternative conductive
paths, which diminishes the capability of the detection units 710 to receive the electrical
characteristics.  Optionally, the application devices 708 and detection units 710 may be
disposed on adjacent vehicles 702 and proximate to the coupling mechanism that couples the
adjacent vehicles, such that the defined conductive test loop 714 may be smaller in length
than the conductive test loop 620 disposed on the single vehicle 602 (shown in Figure 6).

[00128]     Figure 8 is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of an examining system 800 on
a vehicle 802 of a vehicle system (not shown) on a route 804. The examining system 800
may represent the examining system 102 shown in Figure 1 and/or the examining system 200
shown in Figure 2. In contrast to the examining system 200, the examining system 800 is
disposed within a single vehicle 802.     The vehicle 802 may represent at least one of the
vehicles 104, 106 shown in Figure 1.
[00129]     The vehicle 802 includes a first application device 806A that is conductively
and/or inductively coupled to a first conductive track 808A of the route 804, and a second
application device 806B that is conductively and/or inductively coupled to a second
conductive track 808B. A control unit 810 is configured to control supply of electric current
from a power source 811 (e.g., battery 812 and/or conditioning circuits 813) to the first and
second application devices 806A, 806B in order to electrically inject examination signals into
the conductive tracks 808. For example, the control unit 810 may control the application of a
first examination signal into the first conductive track 808A via the first application device
806A and the application of a second examination signal into the second conductive track
808B via the second application device 806B.
[00130]     The control unit 810 is configured to control application of at least one of a
designated direct current, a designated alternating current, or a designated radio frequency
signal of each of the first and second examination signals from the power source 811 to the
conductive tracks 808 of the route 804.      For example, the power source 811 may be an
onboard energy storage device 812 (e.g., battery) and the control unit 810 may be configured
to inject the first and second examination signals into the route 804 by controlling when
electric current is conducted from the onboard energy storage device 812 to the first and
second application devices 806A and 806B. Alternatively or in addition, the power source
811 may be an off-board energy storage device 813 (e.g., catenary and conditioning circuits)
and the control unit 810 is configured to inject the first and second examination signals into
the conductive tracks 808 by controlling when electric current is conducted from the off
board energy storage device 813 to the first and second application devices 806A and 806B.
[00131]     The vehicle 802 also includes a first detection unit 814A disposed onboard the
vehicle 802 that is configured to monitor one or more electrical characteristics of the second
conductive track 808B of the route 804, and a second detection unit 814B disposed onboard
the vehicle 802 that is configured to monitor one or more electrical characteristics of the first
                                               '16

conductive track 808A. An identification unit 816 is disposed onboard the vehicle 802. The
identification unit 816 is configured to examine the one or more electrical characteristics of
the conductive tracks 808 monitored by the detection units 814A, 814B in order to determine
whether a section of the route 804 traversed by the vehicle 802 is potentially damaged based
on the one or more electrical characteristics. As used herein, "potentially damaged" means
that the section of the route may be damaged or at least deteriorated. The identification unit
816 may further determine whether the section of the route traversed by the vehicle is
damaged by distinguishing between one or more electrical characteristics that indicate
damage to the section of the route and one or more electrical characteristics that indicate an
electrical short on the section of the route.
[00132]      Figures 9 through 11 are schematic illustrations of an embodiment of an
examining system 900 on a vehicle 902 as the vehicle 902 travels along a route 904. The
examining system 900 may be the examining system 600 shown in Figure 6 and/or the
examining system 800 shown in Figure 8. The vehicle 902 may be the vehicle 602 of Figure
6 and/or the vehicle 802 of Figure 8. Figures 9 through 11 illustrate various route conditions
that the vehicle 902 may encounter while traversing in a travel direction 906 along the route
904.
[00133]      The vehicle 902 includes two transmitters or application units 908A and 908B,
and two receivers or detection units 910A and 910B all disposed onboard the vehicle 902.
The application units 908 and detection units 910 are positioned along a conductive loop 912
defined by shunts on the vehicle 902 and tracks 914 of the route 904 between the shunts. For
example, the vehicle 902 may include six axles, each axle attached to two wheels in electrical
contact with the tracks 914 and forming a shunt. Optionally, the conductive loop 912 may be
bounded between the inner most axles (e.g., between the third and fourth axles) to reduce the
amount of signal loss through the other axles and/or the vehicle frame. As such, the third and
fourth axles define the ends of the conductive loop 912, and the tracks 914 define the
segments of the conductive loop 912 that connect the ends.
[00134]      The conductive loop 912 defines a test loop 912 (e.g., test section) for detecting
faults in the route 904 and distinguishing damaged tracks 914 from short circuit false alarms.
As the vehicle 902 traverses the route 904, a first examination signal is injected into a first
track 914A of the route 904 from the first application unit 908A, and a second examination
signal is injected into a second track 914B of the route 904 from the second application unit
                                              317

908B.     The first and second examination signals may be injected into the route 904
simultaneously or in a staggered sequence. The first and second examination signals can
each have a unique identifier to distinguish the first examination signal from the second
examination signal as the signals circulate the test loop 912. The unique identifier of the first
examination signal may include a frequency, a modulation, an embedded signature, and/or
the like, that differs from the unique identifier of the second examination signal.           For
example, the first examination signal may have a higher frequency and/or a different
embedded signature than the second examination signal.           Alternatively, the examination
signals may have different frequencies to allow for differentiation of the signals from each
other. For example, the first examination signal may be injected into the route at a frequency
of 4.6 kilohertz (kHz), or another frequency, while the second examination signal is injected
into the route at a frequency of 3.8 kHz (or another frequency).        In one embodiment, the
signals may have different identifiers and different frequencies.
[00135]     In Figure 9, the vehicle 902 traverses over a section of the route 904 that is intact
(e.g., not damaged) and does not have an electrical short. Since there is no electrical short or
electrical break on the route 904 within the area of the conductive test loop 912, which is the
area between two designated shunts (e.g., axles) of the vehicle 902, the first and second
examination signals both circulate a full length of the test loop 912.        As such, the first
examination signal current transmitted by the first application device 908A is detected by
both the first detection device 910A and the second detection device 910B as the first
examination signal current flows around the test loop 912. Although the second examination
signal is injected into the route 904 at a different location, the second examination signal
current circulates the test loop 912 with the first examination signal current, and is likewise
detected by both detection devices 910A, 910B. Each of the detection devices 910A, 910B
may be configured to detect one or more electrical characteristics along the route 904
proximate to the respective detection device 910. Therefore, when the section of route is free
of shorts and breaks, the electrical characteristics received by each of the detection devices
910 includes the unique signatures of each of the first and second examination signals.
[00136]     In Figure 10, the vehicle 902 traverses over a section of the route 904 that includes
an electrical short 916.     The electrical short 916 may be a device on the route 904 or
condition of the route 904 that conductively and/or inductively couples the first conductive
track 914A to the second conductive track 914B.         The electrical short 916 causes current

injected in one track 914 to flow through the short 916 to the other track 914 instead of
flowing along the full length of the conductive test loop 912 and crossing between the tracks
914 at the shunts.     For example, the short 916 may be a piece of scrap metal or other
extraneous conductive device positioned across the tracks 914, a non-insulated signal
crossing or switch, an insulated switch or joint in the tracks 914 that is non-insulated due to
wear or damage, and the like. As the vehicle 902 traverses along route 904 over the electrical
short 916, such that the short 916 is at least temporarily located between the shunts within the
area defined by the test loop 912, the test loop 912 may short circuit.
[00137]     As the vehicle 902 traverses over the electrical short 916, the electrical short 916
diverts the current flow of the first and second examination signals that circulate the test loop
912 to additional loops. For example, the first examination signal may be diverted by the
short 916 to circulate primarily along a first conductive short loop 918 that is newly-defined
along a section of the route 904 between the first application device 908A and the electrical
short 916. Similarly, the second examination signal may be diverted to circulate primarily
along a second conductive short loop 920 that is newly-defined along a section of the route
904 between the electrical short 916 and the second application device 908B. Only the first
examining signal that was transmitted by the first application device 908A significantly
traverses the first short loop 918, and only the second examination signal that was transmitted
by the second application device 908B significantly traverses the second short loop 920.
[00138]     As a result, the one or more electrical characteristics of the route received and/or
monitored by first detection unit 910A may only indicate a presence of the first examination
signal.   Likewise, the electrical characteristics of the route received and/or monitored by
second detection unit 910B may only indicate a presence of the second examining signal. As
used herein, "indicat[ing] a presence of' an examination signal means that the received
electrical characteristics include more than a mere threshold signal-to-noise ratio of the
unique identifier indicative of the respective examination signal that is more than electrical
noise. For example, since the electrical characteristics received by the second detection unit
910B may only indicate a presence of the second examination signal, the second examination
signal exceeds the threshold signal-to-noise ratio of the received electrical characteristics but
the first examination signal does not exceed the threshold. The first examination signal may
not be significantly received at the second detection unit 908B because the majority of the
first examination signal current originating at the device 908A may get diverted along the
                                                 V)

short 916 (e.g., along the first short loop 918) before traversing the length of the test loop 912
to the second detection device 908B. As such, the electrical characteristics with the unique
identifiers indicative of the first examination signal received at the second detection device
910B may be significantly diminished when the vehicle 902 traverses the electrical short 916.
[00139]     The peripheral size and/or area of the first and second conductive short loops 918
and 920 may have an inverse correlation at the vehicle 902 traverses the electrical short 916.
For example, the first short loop 918 increases in size while the second short loop 920
decreases in size as the test loop 912 of the vehicle 902 overcomes and passes the short 916.
It is noted that the first and second short loops 916 are only formed when the short 916 is
located within the boundaries or area covered by the test loop 912.          Therefore, received
electrical characteristics that indicate the examination signals are circulating the first and
second conductive short 918, 920 loops signify that the section includes an electrical short
916 (e.g., as opposed to a section that is damaged or is fully intact without an electrical
short).
[00140]     In Figure 11, the vehicle 902 traverses over a section of the route 904 that includes
an electrical break 922. The electrical break 922 may be damage to one or both tracks 914A,
914B that cuts off (e.g., or significantly reduces) the electrical conductive path along the
tracks 914. The damage may be a broken track, disconnected lengths of track, and the like.
As such, when a section of the route 904 includes an electrical break, the section of the route
forms an open circuit, and current generally does not flow along an open circuit. In some
breaks, it may be possible for inductive current to traverse slight breaks, but the amount of
current would be greatly reduced as opposed to a non-broken conductive section of the route
904.
[00141]     As the vehicle 902 traverses over the electrical break 922 such that the break 922
is located within the boundaries of the test loop 912 (e.g., between designated shunts of the
vehicle 902 that define the ends of the test loop 912), the test loop 912 may be broken,
forming an open circuit. As such, the injected first and second examination signals do not
circulate the test loop 912 nor along any short loops. The first and second detection units
91 OA and 91 OB do not receive any significant electrical characteristics in response to the first
and second examination signals because the signal current do not flow along the broken test
loop 912.    Once, the vehicle 902 passes beyond the break, subsequently injected first and
second examination signals may circulate the test section 912 as shown in Figure 9. It is
                                                40

noted that the vehicle 902 may traverse an electrical break caused by damage to the route 904
without derailing. Some breaks may support vehicular traffic for an amount of time until the
damage increases beyond a threshold, as is known in the art.
[00142]     As shown in Figure 9 through 11, the electrical characteristics along the route 904
that are detected by the detection units 910 may differ whether the vehicle 902 traverses over
a section of the route 904 having an electrical short 916 (shown in Figure 10), an electrical
break 922 (shown in Figure 11), or is electrically contiguous (shown in Figure 9).              The
examining system 900 may be configured to distinguish between one or more electrical
characteristics that indicate a damaged section of the route 904 and one or more electrical
characteristics that indicate a non-damaged section of the route 904 having an electrical short
916, as discussed further herein.
[00143]     Figure 12 illustrates electrical signals 1000 monitored by an examining system on
a vehicle system as the vehicle system travels along a route. The examining system may be
the examining system 900 shown in Figure 9. The vehicle system may include vehicle 902
traveling along the route 904 (both shown in Figure 9). The electrical signals 1000 are one or
more electrical characteristics that are received by a first detection unit 1002 and a second
detection unit 1004. The electrical signals 1000 are received in response to the transmission
or injection of a first examination signal and a second examination signal into the route. The
first and second examination signals may each include a unique identifier that allows the
examining system to distinguish electrical characteristics of a monitored current that are
indicative of the first examination signal from electrical characteristics indicative of the
second examination signal, even if an electrical current includes both examination signals.
[00144]     In Figure 12, the electrical signals 1000 are graphically displayed on a graph 1010
plotting amplitude (A) of the signals 1000 over time (t). For example, the graph 1010 may
graphically illustrate the monitored electrical characteristics in response to the first and
second examination signals while the vehicle 902 travels along the route 904 and encounters
the various route conditions described with reference to Figure 9. The graph 1010 may be
displayed on a display device for an operator onboard the vehicle and/or may be transmitted
to an off-board location such as a dispatch or repair facility. The first electrical signal 1012
represents the electrical characteristics in response to (e.g., indicative of the first examination
signal that are received by the first detection unit 1002. The second electrical signal 1014
represents the electrical characteristics in response to (e.g., indicative of the second
                                                 41

examination signal that are received by the first detection unit 1002.        The third electrical
signal 1016 represents the electrical characteristics in response to (e.g., indicative of the first
examination signal that are received by the second detection unit 1004. The fourth electrical
signal 1018 represents the electrical characteristics in response to (e.g., indicative of) the
second examination signal that are received by the second detection unit 1004.
[00145]     Between times tO and t2, the electrical signals 1000 indicate that both examination
signals are being received by both detection units 1002, 1004.        Therefore, the signals are
circulating the length of the conductive primary test loop 912 (shown in Figures 9 and 10).
At a time tl, the vehicle is traversing over a section of the route that is intact and does not
have an electrical short, as shown in Figure 9. The amplitudes of the electrical signals 1012
1018 may be relatively constant at a baseline amplitude for each of the signals 1012-1018.
The base line amplitudes need not be the same for each of the signals 1012-1018, such that
the electrical signal 1012 may have a different base line amplitude than at least one of the
other electrical signals 1014-1018.
[00146]     At time t2, the vehicle traverses over an electrical short. As shown in Figure 12,
immediately after t2, the amplitude of the electrical signal 1012 indicative of the first
examination signal received by the first detection unit 1002 increases by a significant gain
and then gradually decreases towards the base line amplitude. The amplitude of the electrical
signal 1014 indicative of the second examination signal received by the first detection unit
1002 drops below the base line amplitude for the electrical signal 1014.              As such, the
electrical characteristics received at the first detection unit 1002 indicate a greater
significance or proportion of the first examination signal (e.g., due to the first electrical signal
circulating newly-defined loop 918 in Figure 10), while less significance or proportion of the
second examination signal than compared to the respective base line levels. At the second
detection unit 1004 at time t2, the electrical signal 1016 indicative of the first examination
signal drops in like manner to the electrical signal 1016 received by the first detection unit
1002.    The electrical signal 1018 indicative of the second examination signal gradually
increases in amplitude above the base line amplitude from time t2 to t4 as the test loop passes
the electrical short.
[00147]     These electrical characteristics from time t2 to t4 indicate that the electrical short
defines new circuit loops within the primary test loop 912 (shown in Figures 9 and 10). The
amplitude of the examination signals that were injected proximate to the respective detection
                                                42

units 1002, 1004 increase relative to the base line amplitudes, while the amplitude of the
examination signals that were injected on the other side of the test loop (and spaced apart)
from the respective detection units 1002, 1004 decrease (or drop) relative to the base line
amplitudes. For example the amplitude of the electrical signal 1012 increases by a step right
away due to the first examination signal injected by the first application device 908A
circulating the newly-defined short loop or sub-loop 918 in Figure 10 and being received by
the first detection unit 910A that is proximate to the first application device 908A.        The
amplitude of the electrical signal 1012 gradually decreases towards the base line amplitude as
the examining system moves relative to the electrical short because the electrical short gets
further from the first application device 908A and the first detection unit 910A and the size of
the sub-loop 918 increases. The electrical signal 1018 also increases relative to the base line
amplitude due to the second examination signal injected by the second application device
908B circulating the newly-defined short loop or sub-loop 920 and being received by the
second detection unit 910B that is proximate to the second application device 908A. The
amplitude of the electrical signal 1018 gradually increases away from the base line amplitude
(until time t4) as the examining system moves relative to the electrical short because the
electrical short gets closer to the second application device 908B and second detection unit
910B and the size of the sub-loop 920 decreases.        The amplitude of an examination signal
may be higher for a smaller circuit loop because less of the signal attenuates along the circuit
before reaching the corresponding detection unit than an examination signal in a larger circuit
loop. The positive slope of the electrical signal 1018 may be inverse from the negative slope
of the electrical signal 1012.     For example, the amplitude of the electrical signal 1012
monitored by the first detection device 1002 may be an inverse derivative of the amplitude of
the electrical signal 1018 monitored by the second detection device 1004.          This inverse
relationship is due to the movement of the vehicle relative to the stationary electrical short
along the route.   Referring also to Figure 10, time t3 may represent the electrical signals
1012-1018 when the electrical short 916 bisects the test loop 912, and the short loops 918,
920 have the same size.
[00148]     At time t4, the test section (e.g., loop) of the vehicle passes beyond the electrical
short. Between times t4 and t5, the electrical signals 1000 on the graph 1010 indicate that
both the first and second examination signals once again circulate the primary test loop 912,
as shown in Figure 9.
                                                 41

[00149]     At time t5, the vehicle traverses over an electrical break in the route. As shown in
Figure 12, immediately after t5, the amplitude of each of the electrical signals 1012-1018
decrease or drop by a significant step. Throughout the length of time for the test section to
pass the electrical break in the route, represented as between times t5 and t7, all four signals
1012-1018 are at a low or at least attenuated amplitude, indicating that the first and second
examination signals are not circulating the test loop due to the electrical break in the route.
Time t6 may represent the location of the electrical break 922 relative to the route examining
system 900 as shown in Figure 11.
[00150]     In an embodiment, the identification unit may be configured to use the received
electrical signals 1000 to determine whether a section of the route traversed by the vehicle is
potentially damaged, meaning that the section may be damaged or at least deteriorated. For
example, based on the recorded waveforms of the electrical signals 1000 between times t2-t4
and t5-t7, the identification unit may identify the section of the route traversed between times
t2-t4 as being non-damaged but having an electrical short and the section of route traversed
between times t5-t7 as being damaged. For example, it is clear in the graph 1010 that the
receiver coils or detection units 1002, 1004 both lose signal when the vehicle transits the
damaged section of the route between times t5-t7. However, when crossing the short on the
route between times t2-t4, the first detection unit 1002 loses the second examination signal,
as shown on the electrical signal 1014, and the electrical signal 1018 representing second
examination signal received by the second detection unit 1004 increases in amplitude as the
short is transited. Thus, there is a noticeable distinction between a break in the track versus
features that short the route. Optionally, a vehicle operator may view the graph 1010 on a
display and manually identify sections of the route as being damaged or non-damaged but
having an electrical short based on the recorded waveforms of the electrical signals 1000.
[00151]     In an embodiment, the examining system may be further used to distinguish
between non-damaged track features by the received electrical signals 1000. For example,
wide band shunts (e.g., capacitors) may behave similar to hard wire highway crossing shunts,
except an additional phase shift may be identified depending on the frequencies of the first
and second examination signals. Narrow band (e.g., tuned) shunts may impact the electrical
signals 1000 by exhibiting larger phase and amplitude differences responsive to the relation
of the tuned shunt frequency and the frequencies of the examination signals.
                                                44

 [00152]    The examining system may also distinguish electrical circuit breaks due to
damage from electrical breaks (e.g., pseudo-breaks) due to intentional track features, such as
insulated joints and turnouts (e.g., track switches). In turnouts, in specific areas, only a single
pair of transmit and receive coils (e.g., a single application device and detection unit located
along one conductive track) may be able to inject current (e.g., an examination signal). The
pair on the opposite track (e.g., rail) may be traversing a "fouling circuit," where the opposite
track is electrically connected at only one end, rather than part of the circulating current loop.
 [00153]    With regard to insulated joints, for example, distinguishing insulated joints from
broken rails may be accomplished by an extended signal absence in the primary test loop
caused by the addition of a dead section loop. As is known in the art, railroad standards
typically indicate the required stagger of insulated joints to be 32 in. to 56 in. In addition to
the insulated joint providing a pseudo-break with an extended length, detection may be
enhanced by identifying location specific signatures of signaling equipment connected to the
insulated joints, such as batteries, track relays, electronic track circuitry, and the like. The
location specific signatures of the signaling equipment may be received in the monitored
electrical characteristics in response to the current circulating the newly-defined short loops
918, 920 (shown in Figure 9) through the connected equipment.             For example, signaling
equipment that is typically found near an insulated joint may have a specific electrical
signature or identifier, such as a frequency, modulation, embedded signature, and the like,
that allows the examination system to identify the signaling equipment in the monitored
electrical characteristics. Identifying signaling equipment typically found near an insulated
joint provides an indication that the vehicle is traversing over an insulated joint in the route,
and not a damaged section of the route.
 [00154]    In the alternative embodiment described with reference to Figure 6 in which the
examining system includes at least two detection units that are spaced apart from each other
but less than two application devices (such as zero or one) such that only one examination
signal is injected into the route, the monitored electrical characteristics along the route by the
two detection units may be shown in a graph similar to graph 1010. For example, the graph
may include the plotted electrical signals 1012 and 1016, where the electrical signal 1012
represents the examination signal detected by or received at the first detection unit 1002, and
the electrical signal 1016 represents the examination signal detected by or received at the
second detection unit 1004. Using only the plotted amplitudes of the electrical signals 1012
                                                45r

and 1016 (instead of also 1014 and 1018), the identification unit may determine the status of
the route. Between times tO and t2, both signals 1012 and 1016 are constant (with a slope of
zero) at base line values. Thus, the one or more electrical characteristics indicate that both
detection units 1002, 1004 receive the examination signal, and the identification unit
determines that the section of the route is non-damaged and does not include an electrical
short. Between times t2-and t4, the first detection unit 1002 detects an increased amplitude
of the examination signal above the base line (although the slope is negative), while the
second detection unit 1004 detects a drop in the amplitude of the examination signal. Thus,
the one or more electrical characteristics indicate that the first detection unit 1002 receives
the examination signal but the second detection unit 1004 does not, and the identification unit
determines that the section of the route includes an electrical short. Finally, between times t5
and t7, both the first and second detection units 1002, 1004 detect drops in the amplitude of
the examination signal. Thus, the one or more electrical characteristics indicate that neither
of the detection units 1002, 1004 receive the examination signal, and the identification unit
determines that the section of the route is potentially damaged.              Alternatively, the
examination signal may be the second examination signal shown in the graph 1010 such that
the electrical signals are the plotted electrical signals 1014 and 1018 instead of 1012 and
1016.
[00155]      In the alternative embodiment described with reference to Figure 6 in which the
examining system includes at least two application devices that are spaced apart from each
other but only one detection unit, the monitored electrical characteristics along the route by
the detection unit may be shown in a graph similar to graph 1010. For example, the graph
may include the plotted electrical signals 1012 and 1014, where the electrical signal 1012
represents the first examination signal injected by the first application device (such as
application device 606A in Figure 6) and detected by the detection unit 1002 (such as
detection unit 616A in Figure 6), and the electrical signal 1014 represents the second
examination signal injected by the second application device (such as application device
606B in Figure 6) and detected by the same detection unit 1002. Using only the plotted
amplitudes of the electrical signals 1012 and 1014 (instead of also 1016 and 1018), the
identification unit may determine the status of the route. For example, between times tO and
t2, both signals 1012 and 1014 are constant at the base line values, indicating that the
detection unit 1002 receives both the first and second examination signals, so the section of
the route is non-damaged. Between times t2 and t4, the one or more electrical characteristics
                                               46

monitored by the detection unit 1002 indicate an increased amplitude of the first examination
signal above the base line and a decreased amplitude of the second examination signal below
the base line. Thus, during this time period the detection unit 1002 only receives the first
examination signal and not the second examination signal (beyond a trace or negligible
amount), which indicates that the section of the route may include an electrical short. For
example, referring to Figure 6, the first application device 606A is on the same side of the
electrical short as the detection unit 616A, so the first examination signal is received by the
detection unit 616A and the amplitude of the electrical signals associated with the first
examination signal is increased over the base line amplitude due to the sub-loop created by
the electrical short. However, the second application device 606B is on an opposite side of
the electrical short from the detection unit 616A, so the second examination signal circulates
a different sub-loop and is not received by the detection unit 616A, resulting in the amplitude
drop in the plotted signal 1014 over this time period. Finally, between times t5 and t7, the
one or more electrical characteristics monitored by the detection unit 1002 indicate drops in
the amplitudes of the both the first and second examination signals, so neither of the
examination signals are received by the detection unit 1002. Thus, the section of the route is
potentially damaged, which causes an open circuit loop and explains the lack of receipt by the
detection unit 1002 of either of the examination signals.      Alternatively, the detection unit
1002 may be the detection unit 1004 shown in the graph 1010 such that the electrical signals
are the plotted electrical signals 1016 and 1018 instead of 1012 and 1014.
[00156]      In the alternative embodiment described with reference to Figure 6 in which the
examining system includes only one application device and only one detection unit, the
monitored electrical characteristics along the route by the detection unit may be shown in a
graph similar to graph 1010. For example, the graph may include the plotted electrical signal
1012, where the electrical signal 1012 represents the examination signal injected by the
application device (such as application device 606A shown in Figure 6) and detected by the
detection unit 1002 (such as detection unit 161A shown in Figure 6). Using only the plotted
amplitudes of the electrical signal 1012 (instead of also 1014, 1016, and 1018), the
identification unit may determine the status of the route. For example, between times tO and
t2, the signal 1012 is constant at the base line value, indicating that the detection unit 1002
receives the examination signal, so the section of the route is non-damaged. Between times
t2 and t4, the one or more electrical characteristics monitored by the detection unit 1002
indicate an increased amplitude of the examination signal above the base line, which further
                                               47

indicates that the section of the route includes an electrical short. Finally, between times t5
and t7, the one or more electrical characteristics monitored by the detection unit 1002
indicate a drop in the amplitude of the examination signal, so the examination signal is not
received by the detection unit 1002. Thus, the section of the route is potentially damaged,
which causes an open circuit loop. Alternatively, the detection unit may be the detection unit
1004 shown in the graph 1010 (such as the detection unit 616B shown in Figure 6) and the
electrical signal is the plotted electrical signal 1018 (injected by the application device 606B
shown in Figure 9) instead of 1012.          Thus, the detection unit may be proximate to the
application device in order to obtain the plotted electrical signals 1012 and 1018.           For
example, an application device that is spaced apart from the detection device along a length
of the vehicle or vehicle system may result in the plotted electrical signals 1014 or 1016,
which both show drops in amplitude when the examining system traverses both a damaged
section of the route and an electrical short.        A spaced-apart arrangement between the
detection unit and the application unit that provides one of the plotted signals 1014, 1016 is
not useful in distinguishing between these two states of the route, unless the plotted signal
1014 or 1016 is interpreted in combination with other monitored electrical characteristics,
such as phase or modulation, for example.
[00157]     Figure 13 is a flowchart of an embodiment of a method 1100 for examining a
route being traveled by a vehicle system from onboard the vehicle system. The method 1100
may be used in conjunction with one or more embodiments of the vehicle systems and/or
examining systems described herein. Alternatively, the method 1100 may be implemented
with another system.
[00158]     At 1102, first and second examination signals are electrically injected into
conductive tracks of the route being traveled by the vehicle system. The first examination
signal may be injected using a first vehicle of the vehicle system. The second examination
signal may be injected using the first vehicle at a rearward or frontward location of the first
vehicle relative to where the first examination signal is injected.         Optionally, the first
examination signal may be injected using the first vehicle, and the second examination signal
may be injected using a second vehicle in the vehicle system. Electrically injecting the first
and second examination signals into the conductive tracks may include applying a designated
direct current, a designated alternating current, and/or a designated radio frequency signal to

at least one conductive track of the route. The first and second examination signals may be
transmitted into different conductive tracks, such as opposing parallel tracks.
[00159]     At 1104, one or more electrical characteristics of the route are monitored at first
and second monitoring locations. The monitoring locations may be onboard the first vehicle
in response to the first and second examination signals being injected into the conductive
tracks. The first monitoring location may be positioned closer to the front of the first vehicle
relative to the second monitoring location. Detection units may be located at the first and
second monitoring locations. Electrical characteristics of the route may be monitored along
one conductive track at the first monitoring location; the electrical characteristics of the route
may be monitored along a different conductive track at the second monitoring location.
Optionally, a notification may be communicated to the first and second monitoring locations
when the first and second examination signals are injected into the route. Monitoring the
electrical characteristics of the route may be performed responsive to receiving the
notification.
[00160]     At 1106, a determination is made as to whether one or more monitored electrical
characteristics indicate receipt of both the first and second examination signals at both
monitoring locations.     For example, if both examination signals are monitored in the
electrical characteristics at both monitoring locations, then both examination signals are
circulating the conductive test loop 912 (shown in Figure 9). As such, the circuit of the test
loop is intact. But, if each of the monitoring locations monitors electrical characteristics
indicating only one or none of the examination signals, then the circuit of the test loop may
be affected by an electrical break or an electrical short. If the electrical characteristics do
indicate receipt of both first and second examination signals at both monitoring locations,
flow of the method 1100 may proceed to 1108.
[00161]     At 1108, the vehicle continues to travel along the route. Flow of the method 1100
then proceeds back to 1102 where the first and second examination signals are once again
injected into the conductive tracks, and the method 1100 repeats. The method 1100 may be
repeated instantaneously upon proceeding to 1108, or there may be a wait period, such as 1
second, 2 seconds, or 5 seconds, before re-injecting the examination signals.
[00162]     Referring back to 1106, if the electrical characteristics indicate that both
examination signals are not received at both monitoring locations, then flow of the method
                                               40

1100 proceeds to 1110.        At 1110, a determination is made as to whether one or more
monitored electrical characteristics indicate a presence of only the first or the second
examination signal at the first monitoring location and a presence of only the other
examination signal at the second monitoring location.              For example, the electrical
characteristics received at the first monitoring location may indicate a presence of only the
first examination signal, and not the second examination signal. Likewise, the electrical
characteristics received at the second monitoring location may indicate a presence of only the
second examination signal, and not the first examination signal.           As described herein,
indicatingn] a presence of' an examination signal means that the received electrical
characteristics include more than a mere threshold signal-to-noise ratio of the unique
identifier indicative of the respective examination signal that is more than electrical noise.
[00163]      This determination may be used to distinguish between electrical characteristics
that indicate the section of the route is damaged and electrical characteristics that indicate the
section of the route is not damaged but may have an electrical short. For example, since the
first and second examination signals are not both received at each of the monitoring
locations, the route may be identified as being potentially damaged due to a broken track that
is causing an open circuit.       However, an electrical short may also cause one or both
monitoring locations to not receive both examination signals, potentially resulting in a false
alarm.    Therefore, this determination is made to distinguish an electrical short from an
electrical break.
[00164]      For example, if neither examination signal is received at either of the monitoring
locations as the vehicle system traverses over the section of the route, the electrical
characteristics may indicate that the section of the route is damaged (e.g., broken).
Alternatively, the section may be not damaged but including an electrical short if the one or
more electrical characteristics monitored at one of the monitoring locations indicate a
presence of only one of the examination signals. This indication may be strengthened if the
electrical characteristics monitored at the other monitoring location indicate a presence of
only the other examination signal. Additionally, a non-damaged section of the route having
an electrical short may also be indicated if an amplitude of the electrical characteristics
monitored at the first monitoring location is an inverse derivative of an amplitude of the
electrical characteristics monitored at the second monitoring location as the vehicle system
traverses over the section of the route. If the monitored electrical characteristics indicate
                                               r50

significant receipt of only one examination signal at the first monitoring location and only the
other examination signal at the second monitoring location, then flow of the method 1100
proceeds to 1112.
[00165]      At 1112, the section of the route is identified as being non-damaged but having an
electrical short. In response, the notification of the identified section of the route including
an electrical short may be communicated off-board and/or stored in a database onboard the
vehicle system. The location of the electrical short may be determined more precisely by
comparing a location of the vehicle over time to the inverse derivatives of the monitored
amplitudes of the electrical characteristics monitored at the monitoring locations.             For
example, the electrical short may have been equidistant from the two monitoring locations
when the inverse derivatives of the amplitude are monitored as being equal.               Location
information may be obtained from a location determining unit, such as a GPS device, located
on or off-board the vehicle. After identifying the section as having an electrical short, the
vehicle system continues to travel along the route at 1108.
[00166]      Referring now back to 1100, if the monitored electrical characteristics do not
indicate significant receipt of only one examination signal at the first monitoring location and
only the other examination signal at the second monitoring location, then flow of the method
1100 proceeds to 1114. At 1114, the section of the route is identified as damaged. Since
neither monitoring location receives electrical characteristics indicating at least one of the
examination signals, it is likely that the vehicle is traversing over an electrical break in the
route, which prevents most if not all of the conduction of the examination signals along the
test loop. The damaged section of the route may be disposed between the designated axles of
the first vehicle that define ends of the test loop based on the one or more electrical
characteristics monitored at the first and second monitoring locations. After identifying the
section of the route as being damaged, flow proceeds to 1116.
[00167]      At 1116, responsive action is initiated in response to identifying that the section of
the route is damaged.     For example, the vehicle, such as through the control unit and/or
identification unit, may be configured to automatically slow movement, automatically notify
one or more other vehicle systems of the damaged section of the route, and/or automatically
request inspection and/or repair of the damaged section of the route. A warning signal may
be communicated to an off-board location that is configured to notify a recipient of the
damaged section of the route. A repair signal to request repair of the damaged section of the
                                                 r51

route may be communicated off-board as well. The warning and/or repair signals may be
communicated by at least one of the control unit or the identification unit located onboard the
vehicle.   Furthermore, the responsive action may include determining a location of the
damaged section of the route by obtaining location information of the vehicle from a location
determining unit during the time that the first and second examination signals are injected
into the route.     The calculated location of the electrical break in the route may be
communicated to the off-board location as part of the warning and/or repair signal.
Optionally, responsive actions, such as sending warning signals, repair signals, and/or
changing operational settings of the vehicle, may be at least initiated manually by a vehicle
operator onboard the vehicle or a dispatcher located at an off-board facility.
[00168]     In addition or as an alternate to using one or more embodiments of the route
examination systems described herein to detect damaged sections of a route, one or more
embodiments of the route examination systems may be used to determine location
information about the vehicles on which the route examination systems are disposed. The
location information can include a determination of which route of several different routes on
which the vehicle is currently disposed, a determination of the location of the vehicle on a
route, a direction of travel of the vehicle along the route, and/or a speed at which the vehicle
is moving along the route.
[00169]     Figure 14 is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of the examining system
900 on the vehicle 902 as the vehicle 902 travels along the route 904. While only two axles
1400, 1402 ("Axle 3" and "Axle 4" in Figure 14) are shown in Figure 14, the vehicle 902
may include a different number of axles and/or axles other than the third and fourth axles of
the vehicle 902 may be used.
[00170]     The route 904 can be formed from the conductive rails 614 described above (e.g.,
the rails 614A, 614B). The route 904 can include one or more frequency tuned shunts 1404
that extend between the conductive rails 614A, 614B. A frequency tuned shunt 1404 can
form a conductive pathway or short between the rails 614A, 614B of the route 904 for an
electric signal that is conducted in the rails 614A, 614B at a frequency to which the shunt
1404 is tuned. For example, the shunt 1404 shown in Figure 14 is tuned to a frequency of 3.8
kHz. An electric signal having a frequency of 3.8 kHz that is conducted along the rail 614A
will also be conducted through the shunt 1404 to the rail 614B (and/or such a signal may be
conducted from the rail 614B to the rail 614A through the shunt 1404).          Electric signals
                                                r52

having other frequencies (e.g., 4.6 kHz or another frequency), however, will not be conducted
by the shunt 1404. As a result, a signal having a frequency to which the shunt 1404 is tuned
(referred to as a tuned frequency) that is injected into the rail 614A by the application unit
908B ("Tx2" in Figure 14) will be conducted along a circuit loop or path that includes the rail
614A, the axle 1400, the rail 614B, and the shunt 1404.          This signal is detected by the
detection unit 910B ("Rxl" in Figure 14). Similarly, a signal having the tuned frequency that
is injected into the rail 614B by the application unit 908A ("Txl" in Figure 14) will be
conducted along a circuit loop or path that includes the rail 614B, the axle 1402, the rail
614A, and the shunt 1404. In one embodiment, one or more of the detection units may detect
signals having different frequencies.
[00171]      A signal that has a frequency other than the tuned frequency and that is injected
into the rail 614A by the application unit 908B will be conducted along a circuit loop or path
that includes the rail 614A, the axle 1400, the rail 614B, and the axle 1402, but that does not
include the shunt 1404.       Similarly, a signal that has a frequency other than the tuned
frequency and that is injected into the rail 614B by the application unit 908A will be
conducted along a circuit loop or path that includes the rail 614B, the axle 1402, the rail
614A, and the axle 1400, but that does not include the shunt 1404. A shunt that is tuned to
multiple frequencies, such as 3.8 kHz and 4.6 kHz or a range of frequencies that include 3.8
kHz and 4.6 kHz, will conduct the signals. For example, a shunt that is tuned to a range of
frequencies that include both 3.8 kHz and 4.6 kHz will conduct signals having frequencies of
3.8 kHz or 4.6 kHz between the rails 614A, 614B.
[00172]      One or more frequency tuned shunts can be disposed across routes at designated
locations to calibrate the location of vehicles traveling along the routes. The frequency tuned
shunts can be read by the examining systems described herein to define a specific location of
the vehicle on the route. This can allow for accurate calibration of location of the vehicle
when combined with a location determining system of the vehicle (e.g., a global positioning
system receiver, wireless transceiver, or the like), and can increase the accuracy of the
location of the vehicle when using a dead reckoning technique and/or when another locating
method is unavailable. The detection of the frequency tuned shunts also can also be used to
determine which route of several different routes on which a vehicle is currently located.
[00173]      The examining system can use multiple different frequencies to test the route
beneath the vehicle for damage. By placing an element such as a frequency tuned shunt on
                                                53l

the route that responds to one or a combination of the frequencies, and placing such elements
at planned differences in spacing along the route, codes can be generated to convey
information about the specific location to the vehicle in an economical and reliable manner.
[00174]     Figure 15 illustrates electrical characteristics 1500 (e.g., electrical characteristics
1500A, 1500B) and electrical characteristics 1502 (e.g., electrical characteristics 1502A,
1502B) of the route that may be monitored by the examining system on a vehicle system as
the vehicle system travels along the route 904 (shown in Figure 14) according to one
example.    The electrical characteristics 1500, 1502 are shown alongside a horizontal axis
1504 representative of time or distance along the route 904 and vertical axes 1506
representative of magnitudes of the electrical characteristics 1500, 1502 (as measured by the
detection units 910A, 910B shown in Figure 14. The electrical characteristics 1500, 1502
represent the magnitudes of first and second signals injected into the rails 614 (shown in
Figure 14) of the route 904 by the application units 908, as detected by the detection units
910A, 910B during travel of the vehicle system over the frequency tuned shunt 1404.
[00175]     The application unit 908A can inject a first signal having a frequency that is not
the tuned frequency of the shunt 1404 (or that is outside of the range of tuned frequencies of
the shunt 1404).     The application unit 908B can inject a second signal having the tuned
frequency of the shunt 1404 (or that is within the range of tuned frequencies of the shunt
1404).    The detection unit 910A can detect magnitudes of the first and second signals as
conducted to the detection unit 910A through the rail 614A and the detection unit 910B can
detect magnitudes of the first and second signals as conducted to the detection unit 910B
through the rail 614B. The electrical characteristic 1500A represents the magnitudes of the
first signal (the non-tuned frequency signal) as detected by the detection unit 910B and the
electrical characteristic 1500B represents the magnitudes of the first signal as detected by the
detection unit 910A.     The electrical characteristic 1502A represents the magnitudes of the
second signal (the tuned frequency signal) as detected by the detection unit 910B and the
electrical characteristic 1502B represents the magnitudes of the second signal as detected by
the detection unit 91 OA.
[00176]     A time tl indicates when the axle 1400 (e.g., a leading axle) passes the shunt 1404
as the vehicle system travels along a direction of travel 1406 shown in Figure 14. A time t2
indicates when the axle 1402 (e.g., a trailing axle) passes the shunt 1404 as the vehicle
                                                r54

system travels along the direction of travel 1406. The time period including and between the
times tl and t2 represents when the shunt 1404 is disposed between the axles 1400, 1402.
[00177]      Prior to the axle 1400 passing over the shunt 1404 (e.g., before the time tl), the
first and second signals are conducted through a circuit formed from the axles 1400, 1402 and
the sections of the rails 614 that extend from and between the axles 1400, 1402. As a result,
the magnitudes of the electrical characteristics 1500, 1502 do not appreciably change (e.g.,
the electrical characteristics 1500, 1502 may not change in magnitude or the changes in the
magnitude may be caused by noise or outside interference).
[00178]      Upon the axle 1400 passing the shunt 1404, however, different circuits are formed
for the different first and second signals, depending on the frequencies of the signals. For
example, for the first signal (the non-tuned frequency signal), the circuit through which the
first signal is conducted to the detection units 910A, 910B does not change. As a result, the
magnitudes of the electrical characteristics 1500A, 1500B do not appreciably change. For the
second signal (the tuned frequency signal), the shunt 1404 conducts the second signal and a
smaller, different circuit is formed. The circuit that conducts the second signal includes the
axle 1400, the shunt 1404, and the sections of the rails 614 extending from the axle 1400 to
the shunt 1404. This circuit for the second signal also can prevent the second signal from
being conducted to the detection unit 910A. The smaller circuit that includes the shunt 1404
can prevent the second signal from reaching and being detected by the detection unit 91 OA.
[00179]      The detection unit 910B detects an increase in the second signal at or near the
time tl, as indicated by the increase in the electrical characteristic 1502A shown in Figure 15.
This increase may be caused by decreased electrical impedance in the circuit formed from the
axle 1400, the shunt 1404, and the sections of the rails 614 extending from the axle 1400 to
the shunt 1404.     For example, because this circuit is shorter than the circuit that does not
include the shunt 1404, the electrical impedance may be less.
[00180]      The detection unit 910A may no longer be able to detect the second signal after
time tl due to the circuit formed with the shunt 1404. The circuit formed with the shunt 1404
can prevent the second signal from being conducted in the rail 614A.          The detection unit
910A may detect a decrease or elimination of the second signal, as represented by the
decrease in the electrical characteristic 1502B at time tl.
                                                1-51

[00181]      As the vehicle moves over the shunt 1404, the axle 1400 moves farther from the
shunt 1404. This increasing distance from the axle 1400 to the shunt 1404 increases the size
of the circuit that includes the axle 1400 and the shunt 1404. The impedance of the circuit
through which the electrical characteristic 1502A is conducted increases from time tl to time
t2. The increasing impedance can decrease the magnitude of the second signal (as detected
by the detection unit 910B). As a result, the magnitude of the electrical characteristic 1502A
detected by the detection unit 910B decreases from time tI to time t2. With respect to the
detection unit 910A, because the shunt 1404 continues to prevent the second signal from
being conducted to the detection unit 910A, the magnitude of the electrical characteristics
1502B remain reduced, as shown in Figure 15.
[00182]      Once the vehicle system has moved over the shunt 1404 and the shunt 1404 is no
longer between the axles 1400, 1402 (e.g., after time t2), the second signal is again conducted
through the circuit that does not include the shunt 1404 and that is formed from the axles
1400, 1402 and the sections of the rails 614 extending between the axles 1400, 1402. The
magnitude of the second signal as detected by the detection unit 910B may return to a level
that was measured prior to time tI.     Because the shunt 1404 is no longer preventing the
detection unit 910A from detecting the second signal after time t2, the value of the electrical
characteristic 1502B may increase back to the level that existed prior to the time tl.
[00183]      The examining system can analyze two or more of the electrical characteristics
1500A, 1500B, 1502A, 1502B to differentiate detection of a frequency tuned shunt 1404
from detection of a damaged section of the route 904 and/or the presence of another shunt on
the route 904. A break 922 in a rail 614 in the route 904 may result in two or more signals
1012, 1014, 1016, 1018 as detected by the detection units 910A, 910B to decrease during
concurrent times, as shown in Figure 12 during the time period extending from time t5 to
time t7. In contrast, only one of the electrical characteristics 1500A, 1500B, 1502A, 1502B
decreases during passage of the vehicle system over the shunt 1404. The control unit and/or
identification unit can determine how many electrical characteristics 1500A, 1500B, 1502A,
1502B decrease at a time to determine if the vehicle system is traveling over a damaged
section of the route 904 or over a frequency tuned shunt 1404. A shunt 916 that is not a
frequency tuned shunt 1404 causes two or more (or all) of the signals 1012, 1014, 1016, 1018
to increase and/or decrease during passage over the shunt 916, as shown in Figure 12 during
the time period from time t2 to the time t4. In contrast, only the signals detected by a single
                                               r)6

detection unit 910B change during passage over a frequency tuned shunt 1404. Therefore, if
signals detected by two or more detection units change, then the shunt that is detected may
not be a frequency tuned shunt. If signals detected by the same detection unit change, but the
signals detected by another detection unit do not change, then the shunt that is detected may
be a frequency tuned shunt.
[00184]     The examining systems described herein can examine the electrical characteristics
1500, 1502 to determine a variety of information about the vehicle system and/or the route
904, in addition to or as an alternate to detecting damage to the route 904. As one example,
the control unit 206, 506 and/or identification unit 220, 520 can identify which route 904 the
vehicle system is traveling along. Different routes 904 may have frequency tuned shunts
1404 in different locations and/or sequences.         The location of the shunts 1404 and/or
sequences of the shunts 1404 may be unique to the routes 904 such that, upon detecting the
shunts 1404, the examining systems can determine which route 904 the vehicle system is
traveling along.
[00185]     For example, a first route 904 may have a first shunt 1404 tuned to a first
frequency and a second route 904 may have a second shunt 1404 tuned to a second
frequency. The examining system can inject signals having one or more of the first or second
frequencies to attempt to detect the first and/or second shunt 1404. Upon detecting one or
more of the changes in the electrical characteristics 1502, the examining system can
determine that the vehicle system traveled over the first or second shunt 1404.            If the
examining system is injecting an electrical test signal having the first frequency into the route
904 and the examining system detects the changes in the signal that are similar to the changes
in the electrical characteristics 1502A and/or 1502B, the examining system can determine
that the vehicle system passed over the first shunt 1404.           The first route 904 may be
associated with the first shunt 1404 in a memory 540 of the examining system (shown in
Figure 5, such as a memory of the control unit, identification unit, or the like, and/or as
communicated to the examining system) such that, upon detecting the first shunt 1404, the
examining system determines that the vehicle system is on the first route 904.
[00186]     If the examining system is injecting the electrical test signal having the first
frequency into the route 904 and the examining system does not detect the changes in the
signal that are similar to the changes in the electrical characteristics 1502A and/or 1502B, the
examining system can determine that the vehicle system has not passed over the first shunt
                                                 '5)7

1404. The examining system can then determine that the vehicle system is not on the first
route 904.
[00187]      If the examining system is injecting an electrical test signal having the second
frequency into the route 904 and the examining system detects the changes in the signal that
are similar to the changes in the electrical characteristics 1502A and/or 1502B, the examining
system can determine that the vehicle system passed over the second shunt 1404. The second
route 904 may be associated with the second shunt 1404 such that, upon detecting the second
shunt 1404, the examining system determines that the vehicle system is on the second route
904.    If the examining system is injecting the electrical test signal having the second
frequency into the route 904 and the examining system does not detect the changes in the
signal that are similar to the changes in the electrical characteristics 1502A and/or 1502B, the
examining system can determine that the vehicle system has not passed over the second shunt
1404. The examining system can then determine that the vehicle system is not on the second
route 904.
[00188]      Additionally or alternatively, different routes 904 may be associated with different
sequences of two or more frequency tuned shunts 1404.            A sequence of shunts 1404 can
represent an order in which the shunts 1404 are encountered by a vehicle system traveling
over the sequence of shunts 1404, and optionally may include the frequencies to which the
shunts 1404 are tuned and/or distances between the shunts 1404. For example, Table 1 below
represents different sequences of shunts 1404 in different routes 904:
                                             TABLE 1:

                                      16       B, A, A, B
[00189]     The letters A and B represent different frequencies to which the shunts 1404 are
tuned.    While each sequence of the shunts 1404 in Table 1 includes four shunts 1404,
alternatively, one or more of the sequences may include a different number of shunts 1404.
While the sequences only include two different frequencies, optionally, one or more
sequences may include more frequencies.
[00190]     The examining system can track the order in which different shunts 1404 are
detected by the vehicle system to determine which route 904 that the vehicle system is
traveling along.    For example, if the examining system detects a shunt 1404 tuned to
frequency B, followed by another shunt 1404 tuned to frequency B, followed by another
shunt 1404 tuned to frequency A, followed by a shunt 1404 tuned to frequency A, then the
examining system can determine that the vehicle system is on the eighth route 904 listed
above.
[00191]     A shunt sequence optionally may include distances between shunts 1404. Table 2
below illustrates examples of shunt sequences that also include distances:
                                 Route      Shunt Sequence
                                   9           A, 50 m, A
                                   10          A, 30 m, B
                                   11         A, 100 m, A
                                   12     B, 20 m, A, 30 m, A
[00192]     The numbers 50 m, 30 m, and so on, listed between the letters A and/or B
represent distances between the shunts 1404 tuned to the A or B frequency. The examining
system can detect the shunts 1404 tuned to the different frequencies, the order in which these
shunts 1404 are detected, and the distance between the shunts 1404, in order to determine
which route the vehicle system is traveling along.
[00193]     Using the detection of one or more frequency tuned shunts 1404 to determine
which route 904 the vehicle system is traveling along can be useful for the control unit 206,
506 to differentiate between different routes 904 that are closely spaced together.      Some
routes 904 may be sufficiently close to each other that the resolution of other location
                                               r50(

determining systems (e.g., global positioning systems, wireless triangulation, etc.) may not be
able to differentiate between which of the different routes 904 that the vehicle system is
traveling along. At times, the vehicle system may not be able to rely on such other location
determining systems, such as when the vehicle system is traveling in a tunnel, in valleys,
urban areas, or the like. The detection of a frequency tuned shunt 1404 associated with a
route 904 can allow the examining systems to determine which route 904 the vehicle system
is on when the other location determining systems may be unable to determine which route
904 the vehicle system is traveling on.
[00194]      In another example, the control unit 206, 506 and/or identification unit 220, 520
can determine where the vehicle system is located along a route 904 using detection of one or
more shunts 1404. Different locations along the routes 904 may have frequency tuned shunts
1404 in different locations and/or sequences.         The location of the shunts 1404 and/or
sequences of the shunts 1404 may be unique to the locations along the routes 904 such that,
upon detecting the shunts 1404, the examining systems can determine where the vehicle
system is located along a route 904.
[00195]      For example, a first location along a route 904 may have a first shunt 1404 tuned
to a first frequency and a second location along the route 904 may have a second shunt 1404
tuned to a second frequency. The examining system can inject signals having one or more of
the first or second frequencies to attempt to detect the first and/or second shunt 1404. Upon
detecting one or more of the changes in the electrical characteristics 1502, the examining
system can determine that the vehicle system traveled over the first or second shunt 1404. If
the examining system is injecting an electrical test signal having the first frequency into the
route 904 and the examining system detects the changes in the signal that are similar to the
changes in the electrical characteristics 1502A and/or 1502B, the examining system can
determine that the vehicle system passed over the first shunt 1404. The first location along
the route 904 may be associated with the first shunt 1404 in the memory 540 of the
examining system such that, upon detecting the first shunt 1404, the examining system
determines that the vehicle system is at the location along the first route 904 associated with
the first shunt 1404.
[00196]      If the examining system is injecting the electrical test signal having the first
frequency into the route 904 and the examining system does not detect the changes in the
signal that are similar to the changes in the electrical characteristics 1502A and/or 1502B, the
                                                60

examining system can determine that the vehicle system has not passed over the first shunt
1404. The examining system can then determine that the vehicle system is not located at the
location on the first route 904 that is associated with the first shunt 1404.
[00197]     If the examining system is injecting an electrical test signal having the second
frequency into the route 904 and the examining system detects the changes in the signal that
are similar to the changes in the electrical characteristics 1502A and/or 1502B, the examining
system can determine that the vehicle system passed over the second shunt 1404. The second
location along the route 904 may be associated with the second shunt 1404 such that, upon
detecting the second shunt 1404, the examining system determines that the vehicle system is
at the location on the route 904 associated with the second shunt 1404.         If the examining
system is injecting the electrical test signal having the second frequency into the route 904
and the examining system does not detect the changes in the signal that are similar to the
changes in the electrical characteristics 1502A and/or 1502B, the examining system can
determine that the vehicle system has not passed over the second shunt 1404. The examining
system can then determine that the vehicle system is not at the location along the route 904
that is associated with the second shunt 1404
[00198]     Additionally or alternatively, different locations along routes 904 may be
associated with different sequences of two or more frequency tuned shunts 1404. Similar to
as described above, detection of shunts 1404 in a sequence associated with a designated
location along a route 904 can allow for the examining system to determine where the vehicle
system is located along the route.
[00199]     Using the detection of one or more frequency tuned shunts 1404 to determine
where the vehicle system is located along a route 904 can be useful for the control unit 206,
506 to determine where the vehicle system is located.            As described above, the vehicle
system may not be able to rely on other location determining systems to determine where the
vehicle system is located. Additionally, the examining system can determine the location of
the vehicle system to assist in calibrating or updating a location that is based on a dead
reckoning technique.       For example, if the vehicle system is using dead reckoning to
determine where the vehicle system is located, determination of the location of the vehicle
system using the shunts 1404 can serve as a check or update on the location as determined
using dead reckoning.
                                                 61

[00200]      The determined location of the vehicle system may be used to calibrate or update
other location determining systems of the vehicle system, such as global positioning system
receivers, wireless transceivers, or the like.    Some location determining systems may be
unable to provide locations of the vehicle system after initialization of the location
determining systems.      For example, after turning the vehicle system and/or the location
determining systems on, the location determining systems may be unable to determine the
locations of the vehicle systems for a period of time that the location determining systems are
initializing. The detection of frequency tuned shunts during this initialization can allow for
the vehicle systems to determine the locations of the vehicle systems during the initialization.
[00201]      Optionally, the failure to detect a frequency tuned shunt 1404 in a designated
location can be used by the examining system to determine that the shunt 1404 is damaged or
has been removed. Because the locations of the frequency tuned shunts 1404 may be stored
in the memory 540 of the vehicle system and/or communicated to the vehicle system, the
failure to detect a frequency tuned shunt 1404 at the designated location of the shunt 1404
can serve to notify the examining system that the shunt 1404 is damaged and/or has been
removed.      The examining system and/or control unit can then notify an operator of the
vehicle system of the damaged and/or missing shunt 1404, can cause the communication unit
to automatically send a signal to a scheduling or dispatch facility to schedule inspection,
repair, or replacement of the shunt 1404, or the like.
[00202]      In another example, the control unit 206, 506 and/or identification unit 220, 520
can determine a direction of travel of the vehicle system responsive to detecting one or more
frequency tuned shunts 1404.       Upon detecting the changes in the electrical characteristics
1502 that indicate presence of a frequency tuned shunt 1404, the identification unit can
examine one or more aspects of the electrical characteristics 1502 to determine a direction of
travel 1406.    The identification unit can examine the slope of the electrical characteristic
1502 to determine the direction of travel 1406. If the electrical characteristic 1502 has a
negative slope between time tl and t2, then the slope can indicate that the vehicle system has
the direction of travel 1406 shown in Figure 14. But, if the electrical characteristic 1502 has
a positive slope between time tl and t2, the slope can indicate that the vehicle system has an
opposite direction of travel.
[00203]      In another example, the control unit 206, 506 and/or identification unit 220, 520
can determine a moving speed of the vehicle system responsive to detecting one or more
                                               62

frequency tuned shunts 1404. In one aspect, the examining system can determine the time
period elapsed between time tl and t2 based on the changes in the electrical characteristic
1502A and/or 1502B that indicate detection of the shunt 1404. Based on the elapsed time
period and a separation distance 1408 (shown in Figure 14) between the axles 1400, 1402, the
control unit and/or identification unit can calculate a moving speed of the vehicle system.
For example, if the separation distance 1408 is 397 inches (e.g., ten meters) and the time
period between tl and t2 is 1.13 seconds, then the examining system can determine that the
vehicle system is traveling at approximately twenty miles per hour (e.g., 32 kilometers per
hour).
[00204]     In another example, the control unit 206, 506 and/or identification unit 220, 520
can determine a moving speed of the vehicle system responsive to detecting one or more
frequency tuned shunts 1404. In one aspect, the examining system can determine the slope of
the electrical characteristic 1502A between the time tl and the time t2. Larger absolute
values of the slopes may be associated with faster speeds of the vehicle system than smaller
absolute values of the slopes.    Different absolute values of slopes may be associated with
different speeds in the memory 540 of the examining system and/or as communicated to the
examining system. The control unit and/or identification unit can determine the absolute
value of the slope in the electrical characteristic 1502A and compare the determined slope to
absolute values of the slopes associated with different speeds to determine how fast the
vehicle system is moving.
[00205]     Figure 16 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a method 1600 for
examining a route and/or determining information about the route and/or a vehicle system.
The method 1600 may be performed by one or more embodiments of the examining systems
described herein to detect damage to a route, detect a shunt on the route, and/or determine
information about the route and/or a vehicle system traveling on the route.
[00206]     At 1602, an examination signal having a designated frequency is injected into the
route. The examination signal may have a frequency associated with one or more frequency
tuned shunts. Optionally multiple examination signals may be injected into the route. For
example, different signals having different frequencies associated with frequency tuned
shunts may be injected into the route.
                                                61

[00207]      At 1604, one or more electrical characteristics of the route are monitored. For
example, the voltages, currents, resistances, impedances, or the like, of the route may be
monitored, as described herein. At 1606, the one or more electrical characteristics that are
monitored may be examined to determine if the one or more electrical characteristics indicate
damage to the route, as described above.             Optionally, the one or more electrical
characteristics may be examined to determine if a shunt (e.g., other than a frequency tuned
shunt) is on the route, as described above.       If the one or more electrical characteristics
indicate damage to the route, flow of the method 1600 may proceed toward 1608. Otherwise,
flow of the method 1600 can proceed toward 1610. At 1608, one or more responsive actions
may be initiated to detection of the damage to the route, as described above.
[00208]      At 1610, a determination is made as to whether the one or more electrical
characteristics indicate passage of the vehicle system over a frequency tuned shunt.         As
described above, the characteristic can be examined as one or more of the electrical
characteristics 1500, 1502 shown in Figure 15. If the characteristic indicates movement over
the frequency tuned shunt, then flow of the method 1600 can proceed toward 1616.
Otherwise, flow of the method 1600 can proceed toward 1612.
[00209]      At 1612, a determination is made as to whether a frequency tuned shunt
previously was at the location of the vehicle. For example, if no frequency tuned shunt was
detected at a location, but a frequency tuned shunt is supposed to be at the location, then the
failure to detect the shunt can indicate that the shunt is damaged or removed. As a result,
flow of the method 1600 can proceed toward 1614. If a frequency tuned shunt is not known
to have previously been at that location, however, then flow of the method 1600 can return
toward 1602 or the method 1600 can terminate.
[00210]      At 1614, one or more responsive actions can be implemented responsive to the
failure to detect the shunt. For example, an operator of the vehicle system may be notified, a
message may be communicated to an off-board location to automatically schedule inspection,
repair, or replacement of the frequency tuned shunt, etc.
[00211]      At 1616, information about the vehicle system and/or route is determined based
on detection of the frequency tuned shunt.       As described above, the route on which the
vehicle is traveling may be identified, the location of the vehicle system along the route may
be determined, the direction of travel of the vehicle system, the speed of the vehicle system,
                                               64

etc., may be determined based on detection of one or more frequency tuned shunts. Flow of
the method 1600 may return to 1602 or the method 1600 may terminate.

examination signal into the first conductive track via the first application device and a second
examination signal into the second conductive track via the second application device. The
first detection unit is configured to be disposed onboard the first vehicle.         The second
detection unit is configured to be disposed onboard the second vehicle. The detection units
are configured to monitor one or more electrical characteristics of the conductive tracks in
response to the first and second examination signals being injected into the conductive tracks.
The identification unit is configured to examine the one or more electrical characteristics of
the conductive tracks monitored by the first and second detection units in order to determine
whether a section of the route traversed by the vehicle system is potentially damaged based
on the one or more electrical characteristics.
[00246]     In an aspect, the first detection unit is configured to monitor one or more electrical
characteristics of the second conductive track. The second detection unit is configured to

[00247]     In an aspect, when the section of the route has an electrical short positioned
between two shunts of the vehicle system, a first conductive short loop is defined along the
first and second conductive tracks between one of the two shunts and the electrical short. A
second conductive short loop is defined along the first and second conductive tracks of the
section of the route between the other of the two shunts and the electrical short. The first
application device and the first detection unit are disposed along the first conductive short
loop. The second application device and the second detection unit are disposed along the

[00248]     In an embodiment, a method (e.g., for examining a route and/or determining
information about the route and/or a vehicle system) includes injecting a first electrical
examination signal into a conductive route from onboard a vehicle system traveling along the
route, detecting a first electrical characteristic of the route based on the first electrical
examination signal, and detecting, using a route examining system that also is configured to
detect damage to the route based on the first electrical characteristic, a first frequency tuned
shunt in the route based on the first electrical characteristic.
[00249]     In one aspect, detecting the first frequency tuned shunt in the route occurs

                                               71

[00267]      In one aspect, the first application unit is configured to inject the first electrical
examination signal with a first frequency to which the first frequency tuned shunt is tuned.
The system also can include a second application unit configured to inject a second electrical

[00269]      Another embodiment disclosed herein provides for systems and methods that
detect and classify broken rails by extracting features from electrical characteristics of the
rails and classifying these features with pattern recognition, machine learning, and/or signal
processing methods. The system and method operate in two or more stages. A first stage
includes detecting broken rails based on changes in electrical characteristics in rails
responsive to injecting electric examination signals into the rails. To reduce the rate of false
positive detections, a second stage refines the first-pass detection by discriminating broken
rails from likely sources of false-positive confusions, such as poor wheel-to-rail shunting and
noise, using pattern recognition or machine learning methods.

[00270]      Figure 17 illustrates another example of the examining system 900 in operation.
In the illustrated example, the examining system 900 travels over the route 904 and includes
the application unit 908A ("Txl" in Figure 17) that injects an examination signal having a
first frequency (e.g., "fl current" in Figure 17) into the rail 614A ("Rail 1" in Figure 17) and
the application unit 908B ("Tx2" in Figure 17) that injects an examination signal having a
different, second frequency (e.g., "f2 current" in Figure 17) into the rail 614B ("Rail 2" in
Figure 17).    Optionally, the application units 908 (e.g., application units 908A, 908B) may
inject signals having the same frequencies but different identifiers included therein into the
rails 614A, 614B. In contrast to the example shown in Figure 14, the application unit 908A
and the detection unit 910B may be conductively and/or inductively coupled with the same
rail 614A while the application unit 908B and the detection unit 910A are conductively
and/or inductively coupled with the other rail 614B. Alternatively, the application unit 908A
and the detection unit 910A may be conductively and/or inductively coupled with different
rails 614A, 614B and/or the application unit 908B and the detection unit 910B may be
conductively and/or inductively coupled with different rails 614A, 614B.
[00271]      Figure 18 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a method 1800 for
examining a route. The method 1800 may be performed by one or more embodiments of the
route examining systems described herein to identify damage to the routes, insulated joints in
the routes, shunts across the rails of the routes, or the like. For example, the identification
unit 220, 1816 can perform the analysis of the electrical characteristics and patterns as
described herein.
[00272]      At 1802, a data segment is obtained. The data segment can include the electrical
characteristics measured by the detection units 910A, 910B. For example, the data segment
can include magnitudes of current and/or voltage as measured by the detection units 910A,
910B for two or more different frequencies (e.g., frequency 1 and frequency 2).
[00273]      With continued reference to the flowchart of the method 1800 shown in Figure 18,
Figures 19 through 22 illustrate examples of electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200
measured by the detection units 910 shown in Figure 17. The electrical characteristics 1900,
2000, 2100, 2200 are shown alongside a horizontal axis 1902 representative of time and
vertical axes 1904, 2004 representative of magnitudes of the electrical characteristics 1900,
2000, 2100, 2200.         The electrical characteristics    1900 can represent the electrical
characteristics of the rail 614B (shown in Figure 17) as measured by the detection unit 910A
                                                7'5

(shown in Figure 17) based on injection of the examination signal having the first frequency
and injected into the rail 614A (shown in Figure 17) by the application unit 908A (shown in
Figure 17). The electrical characteristics 2000 can represent the electrical characteristics of
the rail 614B as measured by the detection unit 910A based on injection of the examination
signal having the second frequency and injected into the rail 614B by the application unit
908B (shown in Figure 17).       The electrical characteristics 2100 can represent the electrical
characteristics of the rail 614A as measured by the detection unit 910B based on injection of
the examination signal having the second frequency and injected into the rail 614B by the
application unit 908B.       The electrical characteristics 2200 can represent the electrical
characteristics of the rail 614A as measured by the detection unit 910B based on injection of
the examination signal having the first frequency and injected into the rail 614A by the
application unit 908A.
[00274]     One or more indices of the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200
measured by the different detection units 910 based on different frequencies (or other
different identifiers) can be determined and examined in order to differentiate between noise
in the electrical characteristics and electrical characteristics representative of travel over
insulated joints, damaged sections of the route 904 (shown in Figure 17), shunts across the
rails 614 of the route 904, or the like.
[00275]     At 1804 in the flowchart of the method 1800 shown in Figure 18, a determination
is made as to whether a change in the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200
indicates a break or insulated joint in the route.        This determination may be made by
determining whether the change in the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200
exceeds a designated threshold and/or whether a time period over which the change in the
electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 occurs is within a designated time period.
For example, the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 can be examined to
determine if decreases in the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 exceed a
designated drop threshold (e.g., 50 dB, 40 dB, 30 dB, 10%, 20%, 30%, or the like). In the
illustrated examples, all of the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 decrease by
more than the designated drop threshold at or near two seconds along the horizontal axis
1902 and then increase at approximately four seconds along the horizontal axis 1902.
[00276]     The drops in the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 and/or the time
periods over which the drops occur may be indices of the electrical characteristics 1900,
                                                76

2000, 2100, 2200 that are examined in order to determine whether the route includes a break
in conductivity (e.g., damage to the route, an insulated joint in the route, or the like). The
drops in the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 can be examined to determine
drop time periods 1906, 2006, 2106, 2206 over which the drops in the electrical
characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 occur. For example, the time periods 1906, 2006,
2106, 2206 may be measured from a time when the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000,
2100, 2200 decrease by at least the designated drop threshold to a subsequent time when the
electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 increase by at least the designated drop
threshold. The time periods 1906, 2006, 2106, 2206 of the drops (which may be referred to
herein as drop time periods) can be compared to one or more designated time periods 1908.
In the illustrated embodiment, the drop time periods 1906, 2006, 2106, 2206 are compared to
the same designated time period 1908 of approximately two seconds, but alternatively, the
drop time periods 1906, 2006, 2106, 2206 may be compared to different designated time
periods 1908 and/or a designated time period 1908 of other than two seconds. In one aspect,
the designated time period 1908 may change based on the moving speed of the vehicle or
vehicles on which the detection units 910 are disposed. For faster moving vehicles, the
designated time period 1908 can decrease and for slower moving vehicles, the designated
time period 1908 may increase.
[00277]      In one embodiment, if all of the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200
decrease by at least the designated drop threshold for time periods 1906, 2006, 2106, 2206
that are no longer or no greater than the designated time period 1908, then the electrical
characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 may be indicative of a conductive break in the route,
such as damage to the route, an insulated joint in the route, or the like. Optionally, if at least
a designated threshold or percentage (e.g., at least 75%, at least 50%, etc.) of the electrical
characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 decrease by at least the designated drop threshold for
time periods 1906, 2006, 2106, 2206 that are no longer or no greater than the designated time
period 1908, then the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 may be indicative of a
conductive break in the route, such as damage to the route, an insulated joint in the route, or
the like.    As a result, flow of the method 1800 can proceed toward 1806 for further
examination of the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200.
[00278]      But, if the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 (or at least a
designated threshold of the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200) do not decrease
                                                77

by at least the designated drop threshold and/or within a time period no longer or no greater
than the designated time period 1908, then the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100,
2200 may not be indicative of a break in the conductivity of the route. As a result, flow of
the method 1800 can proceed toward 1808.
 [00279]    At 1808, a determination is made that the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000,
2100, 2200 are not representative of a break in the electrical conductivity of the route. For
example, the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 may not indicate a break in the
route, damage to the route, an insulated joint or segment in the route, or the like. Flow of the
method 1800 may then terminate or return to 1802 to obtain and examine additional electrical
characteristics.
 [00280]    At 1806, the electrical characteristics may be examined to ensure that the
detection of the break or insulated joint is not false-positive detection.         The electrical
characteristics can be further analyzed to check on whether detection of the break or insulated
joint at 1804 is not indicative of another condition, such as oil or other debris on the route,
reduced conductivity between the wheels of the vehicle and the route, etc. This additional
check on the electrical characteristics can significantly reduce the number of times that a
break or insulated joint in a rail is incorrectly identified.
 [00281]    In one aspect, one or more feature vectors are determined based on the electrical
characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200. The feature vectors also may be referred to as indices
of the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200. The feature vector for an electrical
characteristic 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 can include multiple measurements or calculations
derived from the electrical characteristic 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200.         In one embodiment,
several feature vectors are calculated for each electrical characteristic 1900, 2000, 2100,
2200.
 [00282]    The feature vectors calculated for an electrical characteristic 1900, 2000, 2100,
2200 can include one or more statistical measures of the electrical characteristic. A statistical
measure can include a mean or median value 1910, 2010, 2110, 2210 of the electrical
characteristic 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 prior to the decrease in the electrical characteristic
 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 by more than the designated drop threshold. The feature vectors also
can include a statistical measure, such as a standard deviation 1912, 2012, 2112, 2212 or
other measurement representative of how much the electrical characteristic 1900, 2000, 2100,

2200 varies prior to the decrease in the electrical characteristic 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 by
more than the designated drop threshold.
[00283]     The time period over which the mean or median values 1910, 2010, 2110, 2210
are calculated for the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 and/or the standard
deviations 1912, 2012, 2112, 2212 can include a time period that is as long as the drop time
period 1906.     Alternatively, these values may be calculated over longer or shorter time
periods.
[00284]     The feature vectors calculated for an electrical characteristic 1900, 2000, 2100,
2200 can include a statistical measure, such as a mean or median value 1914, 2014, 2114,
2214 of the electrical characteristic 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200, within the drop time periods
1906, 2006, 2106, 2206. The feature vectors also can include a statistical measure, such as a
standard deviation 1916, 2016, 2116, 2216 or other measurement representative of how much
the electrical characteristic 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 varies during the drop time periods 1906,
2006, 2106, 2206.
[00285]     The feature vectors calculated for an electrical characteristic 1900, 2000, 2100,
2200 can include statistical measure, such as a mean or median value 1918, 2018, 2118, 2218
of the electrical characteristic 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 after the drop time periods 1906, 2006,
2106, 2206. The feature vectors also can include a statistical measure, such as a standard
deviation 1920, 2020, 2120, 2220 or other measurement representative of how much the
electrical characteristic 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 varies after the drop time periods 1906, 2006,
2106, 2206.
[00286]     The time period over which the mean or median values 1918, 2018, 2118, 2218
are calculated for the electrical characteristics 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200 and/or the standard
deviations 1920, 2020, 2120, 2220 can include a time period that is as long as the drop time
period 1906.     Alternatively, these values may be calculated over longer or shorter time
periods.
[00287]     The statistical measures can include means and/or median values, as described
herein,   but optionally     may   include   other  statistical calculations of the    electrical
characteristics.   For example, medians, root mean square values, or the like, may be
calculated and included in the feature vectors. The statistical measures that are calculated for
the electrical characteristics can be the indices of the electrical characteristics that are
                                                7C)

examined in order to determine if the electrical characteristics are representative of travel
over a break in the conductivity of the route. These indices represent the feature vectors of
the electrical characteristics. In one embodiment, a combination of the mean or median value
of an electrical characteristic prior to the decrease by more than the drop threshold and the
standard deviation of the same electrical characteristic prior to the decrease by more than the
drop threshold is a first feature vector of that electrical characteristic. This first feature vector
can be referred to as pre-drop feature vector. A combination of the mean or median value of
an electrical characteristic during the drop time period and the standard deviation of the same
electrical characteristic during the drop time period is a second feature vector of that
electrical characteristic. This second feature vector can be referred to as drop feature vector.
A combination of the mean or median value of an electrical characteristic after the increase
from the drop time period and the standard deviation of the same electrical characteristic after
the increase from the drop time period is a third feature vector of that electrical characteristic.
This third feature vector can be referred to as post-drop feature vector. If four electrical
characteristics are monitored (e.g., voltages associated with injected currents having two
different frequencies as sensed by two different detection units), then there can be twelve
feature vectors (e.g., three feature vectors per electrical signal). Alternatively, a different
number of feature vectors may be determined, or a single feature vector may be determined.
The feature vectors for the electrical signals being monitored can be referred to as a set of
feature vectors.
[00288]     In one aspect, the values of the feature vectors may be multiplied by a constant
value. The constant value may be based on the number of electrical characteristics being
monitored. For example, if four electrical characteristics are being monitored, then the values
of the feature vectors for all four electrical characteristics may be multiplied by four.
Alternatively, the values of the feature vectors may be multiplied by another constant, or may
not be multiplied by a constant.
[00289]     At 1810, the set of feature vectors are compared to one or more patterns of feature
vectors. The patterns can represent different conditions of the route. A first feature pattern
can include feature vectors representative of travel over a break in a rail of the route. A
different, second feature pattern can include feature vectors representative of travel over an
insulated joint in the route. A different, third feature pattern can include feature vectors
representative of travel over a shunt that conductively couples the rails of the route. A

different, fourth feature pattern can include feature vectors representative of travel over a
crossing between routes. One or more other patterns may be used.
[00290]     The set of feature vectors can be compared to the patterns of the feature vectors to
determine which, if any, of the patterns of the feature vectors that the set of feature vectors
matches (or matches more closely than one or more other patterns).              In aspect, linear
discriminant analysis is used to compare the set of feature vectors with the patterns. The
analysis can be used to find a linear combination of feature vectors that matches, or more
closely matches, the set of feature vectors, than one or more other linear combination of the
feature vectors. Different linear combinations of feature vectors can be the different patterns
of the feature vectors. The linear combination that matches or more closely matches the set
of feature vectors than one or more other linear combinations may be identified as a matching
pattern of feature vectors.
[00291]     In another aspect, a Gaussian mixture model may be used to determine if the set of
feature vectors matches a pattern associated with one or more conditions of the route. The
Gaussian mixture model can be used to calculate probabilities that at least a subset of the
feature vectors in the set match some or all of the feature vectors associated with a pattern.
Depending on the probabilities that the subset of the feature vectors in the set match some or
all feature vectors of different patterns, a pattern may be selected to identify the condition of
the route.
[00292]     In another aspect, one or more support vector machines may be used to determine
which pattern is matched by or more closely matched by the set of feature vectors than one or
more (or all) other patterns. The support vector machine analysis can involve one or more
processors (e.g., of the identification unit 520 shown in Figure 5) examining feature vectors
that are previously associated as being representative or indicative of different conditions of
the route. The support vector machine analysis constructs categories of different feature
vectors, with the categories associated with the different route conditions. The support vector
machine analysis then examines the set of feature vectors to determine which of these
categories that the set of feature vectors more closely matches than other categories. The
condition of the route may then be identified based on this category.
[00293]     Optionally, another technique may be used to determine if the set of feature vector
matches or more closely matches a pattern of feature vectors.

[00294]     Figure 23 illustrates examples of feature vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306 included
in different patterns representative of different conditions of the route. The patterns include
different values for the feature vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306 associated with the different
electrical characteristics being measured. The feature vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306 (e.g.,

[00295]     The feature vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306 are shown in columns associated with

above "Ch 11 (Post)" represent the feature vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306 (e.g., the means
and standard deviations) calculated for the time after the drop time period for electrical
characteristics measured by the first detection unit 910A based on the signal injected into the
rail with the first frequency.
[00296]     The feature vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306 above "Ch22 (BRK)" represent the
feature vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306 (e.g., the means and standard deviations) calculated
during the drop time period for electrical characteristics measured by the second detection

vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306 above "Ch22 (Pre)" represent the feature vectors 2300, 2302,
2304, 2306 (e.g., the means and standard deviations) calculated for the time prior to the drop
time period for electrical characteristics measured by the second detection unit 910B based
on the signal injected into the rail with the second frequency.        The feature vectors 2300,
2302, 2304, 2306 above "Ch22 (Post)" represent the feature vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306
(e.g., the means and standard deviations) calculated for the time after the drop time period for

electrical characteristics measured by the second detection unit 910B based on the signal
injected into the rail with the second frequency.
[00297]      The feature vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306 above "Chl2 (BRK)" represent the
feature vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306 (e.g., the means and standard deviations) calculated
during the drop time period for electrical characteristics measured by the first detection unit
910A based on the signal injected into the rail with the second frequency.            The feature
vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306 above "Chl2 (Pre)" represent the feature vectors 2300, 2302,
2304, 2306 (e.g., the means and standard deviations) calculated for the time prior to the drop
time period for electrical characteristics measured by the first detection unit 910A based on
the signal injected into the rail with the second frequency. The feature vectors 2300, 2302,
2304, 2306 above "Chl2 (Post)" represent the feature vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306 (e.g.,
the means and standard deviations) calculated for the time after the drop time period for
electrical characteristics measured by the first detection unit 910A based on the signal
injected into the rail with the second frequency.
[00298]      The feature vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306 above "Ch2l (BRK)" represent the
feature vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306 (e.g., the means and standard deviations) calculated
during the drop time period for electrical characteristics measured by the second detection
unit 910B based on the signal injected into the rail with the first frequency.         The feature
vectors 2300, 2302, 2304, 2306 above "Ch2l (Pre)" represent the feature vectors 2300, 2302,
2304, 2306 (e.g., the means and standard deviations) calculated for the time prior to the drop
time period for electrical characteristics measured by the second detection unit 910B based

the means and standard deviations) calculated for the time after the drop time period for
electrical characteristics measured by the second detection unit 910B based on the signal
injected into the rail with the first frequency.
[00299]      The feature vectors 2300 for each of the different time periods and the electrical
characteristics represent a first pattern indicative of travel over a break in a rail of the route.
For example, the values of the mean and standard deviation for the feature vectors 2300
above Ch 11 (BRK), Ch 11 (Pre), Ch 11 (Post), Ch22 (BRK), Ch22 (Pre), Ch22 (Post), Ch12
(BRK), Ch12 (Pre), Ch12 (Post), Ch21 (BRK), Ch21 (Pre), and Ch22 (Post) are included in
the first pattern.

[00300]     The feature vectors 2302 for each of the different time periods and the electrical
characteristics represent a second pattern indicative of travel over an insulated joint in a rail
of the route. For example, the values of the mean and standard deviation for the feature
vectors 2302 above Ch 11 (BRK), Ch 11 (Pre), Ch 11 (Post), Ch22 (BRK), Ch22 (Pre), Ch22
(Post), Ch12 (BRK), Ch12 (Pre), Ch12 (Post), Ch21 (BRK), Ch21 (Pre), and Ch22 (Post) are
included in the second pattern.
[00301]     The feature vectors 2304 for each of the different time periods and the electrical
characteristics represent a third pattern indicative of travel over a shunt between rails of the
route. For example, the values of the mean and standard deviation for the feature vectors
2304 above Ch 11 (BRK), Ch 11 (Pre), Ch 11 (Post), Ch22 (BRK), Ch22 (Pre), Ch22 (Post),
Chl2 (BRK), Chl2 (Pre), Chl2 (Post), Ch21 (BRK), Ch21 (Pre), and Ch22 (Post) are
included in the third pattern.
[00302]     The feature vectors 2306 for each of the different time periods and the electrical
characteristics represent a fourth pattern indicative of travel over a crossing between routes.
For example, the values of the mean and standard deviation for the feature vectors 2306
above Ch 11 (BRK), Ch 11 (Pre), Ch 11 (Post), Ch22 (BRK), Ch22 (Pre), Ch22 (Post), Chl2
(BRK), Chl2 (Pre), Chl2 (Post), Ch2l (BRK), Ch2l (Pre), and Ch22 (Post) are included in
the fourth pattern.
[00303]     Returning to the description of the flowchart of the method 1800 shown in Figure
18, at 1812, a determination is made as to whether the set of feature vectors calculated for the
electrical characteristics being monitored for a vehicle match the feature vectors of a pattern.
If the values of the feature vectors in the set match or are within a designated range of the
feature vectors of a pattern, then the set of feature vectors match the pattern.         In one
embodiment, a degree of match between the set of feature vectors and the feature vectors of a
pattern is calculated.   The closer that the values of the feature vectors in the set are to the
values of the feature vectors in the pattern, the larger of a value of the degree of match. The
degree of match may be compared to one or more thresholds, such as 70%, 80%, 90%, or the
like.
[00304]     In one embodiment, the patterns to which the feature vectors are compared
represent a break in the rail of a route or an insulated joint. If the degree of match exceeds
the threshold, then the set of feature vectors may be identified as matching the pattern. As a

result, the set of feature vectors may indicate that the route includes a break in a rail or an
insulated joint, and flow of the method 1800 can proceed toward 1814. Otherwise, the set of
feature vectors may not indicate a break or insulated joint. As a result, flow of the method
1800 can proceed toward 1816.
[00305]      At 1814, a break or insulated joint in the route is identified.       The break or
insulated joint may be identified based on which pattern was matched or more closely
matched by the set of feature vectors.        Responsive to the break or insulated joint being
identified, one or more responsive actions may be implemented. For example, responsive to
a break being detected, the systems and methods described herein may automatically
communicate one or more signals to schedule inspection or repair of the route, to slow or stop
movement of the vehicle, or the like. Responsive to the insulated joint being identified, the
systems and methods described herein may attempt to identify a location of the vehicle along
the route, which route is being traveled by the vehicle, or the like. Flow of the method 1800
may then terminate or return to           1802 to obtain and examine additional electrical
characteristics.
[00306]      At 1816, a break or insulated joint in the route is not identified. For example, the
set of feature vectors may not match the patterns associated with a break or insulated joint.
The set of feature vectors may be representative of noise or another condition in the route
other than the break or insulated joint. Flow of the method 1800 may then terminate or return
to 1802 to obtain and examine additional electrical characteristics.
