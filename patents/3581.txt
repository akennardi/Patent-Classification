A TRAY
FIELD
[0001] The present invention relates to trays, and more particularly but not exclusively to trays
that receive oysters or the like.
BACKGROUND
[0002] Oyster trays generally consist of a moulded plastic body with a plurality of cavities, with
each cavity being designed to receive and support a single oyster. The trays have an upper
surface that provides for stacking of the trays. Each of the oysters is loosely held in its
associated cavity.
[0003] The oysters are located very close to the upper stacking surface of the trays.
[0004] The disadvantages of the above discussed trays are that the oysters are only loosely held
in their associated cavities. During transportation and merchandising (including wholesale and
retail) the oysters can become dislodged. If the oysters become dislodged, the oysters are not
arranged in the most aesthetic manner, can frequently inhibit stacking, and are less likely to be
sold.
OBJECT
[0005] It is the object of the present invention to overcome or substantially ameliorate at least
one of the above disadvantages.

         a body having an article receiving space within which the body provides a plurality of
article receiving cavities, and a rim surrounding the space; and
         a retaining member attached to the body and located above the cavities so as to pass

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT
[0033] In the accompanying drawings there is schematically depicted a tray 10 within which
articles, such as oysters, are to be supported for the purposes of transportation and handling. The
tray 10 has a body 11. In this embodiment the body 11 is adapted to receive and support six
oysters. However, it should be appreciated that the tray 10 could support two or more oysters,
depending on the configuration of the tray 10.
[0034] The tray 10 includes a body 11 that is square or rectangular in configuration. The tray 10
has a rim 14 having longitudinal rim portions 12 and transverse rim portions 13. The portions 13
are generally perpendicular to the rim portions 12. The rim 14 provides a generally planar
upwardly facing surface 29.
[0035] Extending downwardly from the rim 14 is a pair of first side walls 15 and a pair of
second side walls 16.
[0036] The first and second side walls 15 and 16 surround an article receiving space 17,
providing a plurality of article receiving cavities 18. The rim 14 surrounds the space 17 so that
the space 17 has an open top providing for location and removal of the oysters with respect to the
cavities 18. Each cavity 18 is adapted to receive and support a respective one of the oysters (not
shown).
[0037] Each cavity 18 is provided by a body cavity portion 19. Each body cavity portion 19 has
a cup part 20, that provides one of the cavities 18, and a plurality of surfaces 21. In this
embodiment the surfaces 21 are generally planar, horizontal and upwardly facing. Also provided
are walls 33 that separate adjacent cavities 18.
[0038] The surfaces 21 are spaced downwardly from the rim 14 and therefore surface 29.

                                                   5
[0039] The body 11 also provides a pair of generally planar surfaces 28 that are upwardly facing,
and preferably coplanar with respect to the surfaces 21. Each of the surfaces 28 is provided with
a cavity or projection that engages a projection or cavity of a retaining member 22. The
retaining member 22 of this embodiment is a strap that extends between the sides 16.
[0040] In this embodiment the body 11 is provided with recesses 23 that engage correspondingly
shaped projections 24 of the retaining member 22 so that the retaining member 22 is fixed to the
body 11. Preferably, the projections 24 releasably engage in the recesses 23 so that the retaining
member 22 can be removed and re-engaged to be secured to the body 11.
[0041] The retaining member 22 extends generally centrally longitudinally of the body 11 so as
to pass above a portion of each of the cavities 18. Accordingly, at least part of each of the
cavities 18 is exposed. However, the retaining member 22 passes above at least part of each of
the oysters so as to aid in retaining each of the oysters with its associated cavity 18. However,
the retaining member 22 does not entirely cover each cavity 18, accordingly the oysters are also
exposed so that they can be viewed.
[0042] Preferably, the surfaces 21 and 28 are located in a plane 27 that is generally parallel to
the surface 29.
[0043] Preferably, the body 11 has a plurality of downwardly facing surfaces 26 that are located
in a plane 27, so that the tray 10 when supported on a horizontal supporting body 31, the tray 10
is generally horizontally oriented. Preferably, the surface 30 of the supporting body 31 is
generally parallel to the plane 27, and the surface 29.
[0044] Preferably, the retaining member 22 is spaced below the surface 29 by a distance 32.
This provides a stacking space 34 between the surface 29 and the retaining member 22 so that a
like tray 10 may be stacked on the next adjacent below tray 10 and project into the stacking
space 34 to rest on the retaining member 22.
[0045] When empty, and the retainer member 22 removed, the body 11 is stackable with like
bodies, that is they can be nested.
[0046] The retaining member 22, as mentioned above, may be a strap, with the retaining member
22 being opaque, transparent or translucent.
