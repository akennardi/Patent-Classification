DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0026] A package, container, or container sleeve may be constructed of, and/or insulated with a
insulating material. The insulating material may be fixed to a container or it may be applied to a
removable sleeve. Insulating material, such as thermally-expandable and/or void containing
material may be applied to the container or an outer wall or both. Insulating materials that are

                                                   4
not expandable, or that are expanded in ways other than by temperature may also be used, for
example, pressure sensitive materials, light sensitive materials, microwave sensitive materials
and others. The insulating material may be expanded before reaching an end user, such as when
the container and/or container sleeve are manufactured, and/or the insulating material may be
expanded only on end use and only in response to, for example, temperature or pressure. The
insulating material may be used to aid with insulating capabilities of the container and/or
container sleeve, and/or to add rigidity to the container and/or the container sleeve, such as to
reduce a thickness of the material components of container and/or container sleeve.
[0027] FIG. 1 illustrates a container 100, such as a cup, with an inner wall 102 and an outer
wall 104. The blank for the outer wall 104 may be in the form of a container sleeve or a wall or
body of a container 100. The container is not limited to a cup and may be any other container,
including but not limited to, a bulk coffee container, a soup tub, press-formed containers, plate,
sleeve (e.g., single face corrugated, double face corrugated, uncorrugated, cardboard, etc.),
folding cartons, trays, bowls, clamshells, and others with or without covers or sleeves. The
container 100 may be a cylindrical cup or a container having other geometrical configurations,
including conical, rectangular, etc. The outer wall 104 blank is not limited to a corrugated die
cut blank, and may be constructed of any kind of paperboard, paper, foil, film, fabric, foam,
plastic, and etc. The outer wall 104 may be made of any nominal paper stock, including but not
limited to, natural single-face, white-topped single face, coated bleached top single-face,
corrugate, fluted corrugate or any combination of these. The outer wall 104 may be removable
from the container 100 or the outer wall 1 04 may be adhered to the container 100. The outer
wall 104 may be adhered, for example, by laminating the outer wall 104 blank onto the
container, using a hot melt, cold melt and/or any other adhesive or sealing mechanisms.
Alternatively or in addition, the outer wall 104 blank may be adhered with an insulating
material. If the outer wall 104 is attached to the cup during manufacture, it may increase
efficiency by eliminating an assembly step by the commercial end-user. Further, it may decrease
the amount of storage space required by the commercial end-user, e.g., storing one item as
opposed to two.
[0028] FIG. 1 is not necessarily drawn to scale. For example, the outer wall 104 may cover a
larger or smaller portion of the container's 100 surface than illustrated. For example, the outer
wall 104 may provide full body coverage. Increasing the surface area of the outer wall 104 may
provide a larger insulated area as well as a larger print surface. Although the drawing illustrates

                                                   5
the outer wall 104 on a cup, the outer wall 104 may be added to any other containers, such as
but not limited to, a bulk beverage container, press-formed container, and soup tub.
Alternatively or additionally, the outer wall 104 may be added to a container sleeve.
 [0029] Fig. 2 is a side cutaway view of a container 100, which may be a double wall cup. The
container 100 may provide a jacket of air 200 between an outer wall 104 and contents 206, such
as a hot or cold beverage or food, of the container 100. The air jacket 200 may provide thermal
insulation as measured by an outside surface temperature To. The air jacket 200 may partially or
completely surround the container 100. When the container 100 is grabbed, a pressure exerted
on the outer wall 104 may act to collapse the outer wall 104 at pressure points to reduce the air
jacket 200 and potentially initiate contact with an inner wall 102 of the container 100. The air
jacket 200 may collapse under pressure points and may give a sense of low rigidity, and the
contact may create hot spots on the outer wall 104.
 [0030] An insulating material 216 applied between the inner wall 102 and the outer wall 104
may reduce or eliminate this effect. If a sufficient amount of insulating material 216 is used, the
insulating material 216 may act to provide rigidity without compromising the thermal insulation
of the air jacket 200 to the outer wall 104 such that the outer wall 104 does not collapse,
completely or partially. The insulating material 216 may add mechanical strength to the
container 100. Lighter weight materials may be used to produce the container 100 due to
mechanical strength added by the insulating material 216, such that the source of a substrate
forming the container 100 may be reduced. The insulating material 216 may be applied in spots,
such as dots, or another pattern, either on the inner wall 102, the outer wall 104, or both, such
that the insulating material 216 defines an air gap 200 and prevents the outer wall 104 from
collapsing onto the inner wall 102 under holding pressure. The insulating material 216 may also
provide a rigid feel to the user, while allowing a reduction of a substrate material, for example
the inner wall 102 or outer wall 104.
 [0031] The insulating material 216 may expand when activated, or may be pre-expanded, for
example, by the inclusion of air or inert gas, in situ air voids, microspheres, expandable
microspheres or other foaming agents. The insulating material 216 may be activated by, for
example, temperature, pressure, moisture, or otherwise. In one example, the insulating material
216 may be thermally activatable, by a hot or cold temperature. The insulating material 216 may
be an expandable insulating material or adhesive. Additionally or alternatively, the insulating

                                                   6
material 216 may include but is not limited to, binder, expandable microspheres or other micro
encapsulated particles, pigment and other additives, adhesives (e.g., hot melt, pressure
sensitive), inert gas foamed hot melt, aqueous coating containing heat expandable microspheres,
starch-based adhesives, natural polymer adhesives, PVC, foam coatings, biodegradable glues, or
any combination of these or other materials. The insulating material 216 may include in-situ air
voids, microspheres, microparticles, fibers, expandable fibers, dissolving particles, and etc. The
insulating material 216 may be biodegradable, compostable, and/or recyclable.
[0032] The insulating material 216 may be expandable when wet or dry. The insulating
material 216 may include any synthetic or natural material including aqueous based, solvent
based, high solids, or 100% solid materials. The amount of solid content is typically 30% to
80% of the material, and more preferably 40% to 70%. Additional ingredients may be added to
the binder and/or insulating material 216, including but not limited to, pigments or dyes,
fillers/extenders, surfactants for dispersion, thickeners or solvents to control viscosity for
optimized application, foaming agents, defoaming agents, additives like waxes or slip aids, etc.
Alternatively, the binder and/or insulating material 216 may be an adhesive. The insulating
material 216 may have several properties, including but not limited to thermal insulation to keep
container contents hot or cold, absorption of condensation and/or liquid, and/or it may expand
on contact with hot material (such as, over 150 'F), and preferably remains inactive before a
determined designed activation temperature, such as at about room temperatures. The insulating
material 216 may be repulpable, recyclable, and/or biodegradable.
[0033] In a further example an inert gas, such as nitrogen gas, may be injected into the
insulating material 216. For example, an inert gas, such as nitrogen gas, may be injected into a
hot-melt adhesive, starch-based adhesive, or natural polymer adhesive may be used. The gas
may be applied onto the outer surface of the inner wall 102 before placing the outer wall 104 to
give these materials foam structure, and therefore improve the mechanical and thermal
insulation properties of the double wall container. The gas may be injected into the insulating
material 216, for example, before it is applied to the outer wall 104, or during application to
outer wall 104.
[0034] Alternatively or additionally, the insulating material 216 may be a coating or adhesive
that is combined with a blowing agent or foaming agent. The blowing or foaming agent may
generate a gas upon heating which may activate the insulating material 216 to assume, for

                                                  7
example, air voids, a cellular structure, or otherwise. Alternatively, the blowing or foaming
agent may be a material that decomposes to release a gas under certain conditions such as
temperature or pressure. Heating may occur during filling of the container with contents 206,
such as hot food or beverage. Alternatively, heating may occur from an external source - such as
a microwave or water bath.
[0035] FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate a container 100 with an outer wall 104. The container 100 may
be constructed as a double-wall cup assembly. The container 100 may be a cylindrical cup,
container sleeve or container having other geometrical configurations, including conical,
rectangular, etc. The outer wall 104 may fully or partially cover the body of the container 100.
The container 100 and outer wall 104 may be integrated into a double wall cup and the
insulating material 216 and/or adhesive may be applied between the inner wall 102 and the outer
wall 104. The insulating material may additionally have adhesive properties and thus may form
the only attachment between the container and the blank. The outer wall 104 may be made of
any nominal paper stock, including but not limited to, natural single-face, white-topped single
face, coated bleached top single-face or any combination of these. Alternatively or additionally,
the outer wall 104 may be made with foil, film, fabric, plastic, or other materials. The outer wall
104 and/or container may be repulpable, recyclable and/or biodegradable.
[0036] The outer wall 104 may include, for example, corrugated, flute (e.g., E-flute, F-flute, N
flute, or G-flute) uncorrugated or embossed air channels. The air channels may be in a vertical,
diagonal, or other direction and may channel heat away from the hands. Additionally or
alternatively, air channels may arise from the application of the insulating material 216. For
example, the insulating material 216 may be applied to the outer wall 104 in a striped, swirled,
or dotted pattern such that air channels are formed or expanded before, during or after activation
by, e.g., heat or pressure. The insulating material 216 may include blowing agents, foaming
agents, and/or other agents that, upon activation, dissolve, generate gas, or disintegrate, and thus
create air voids or foam structure.
[0037] The outer wall 104 may be removable from the container 100, such as a sleeve, or the
outer wall 104 may be adhered to the container 100, such as in a double wall container. For
example, a double wall container, such as a cup, or a double wall container sleeve may be
manufactured by laminating the outer wall 104 onto the container or container sleeve blank,
using an insulating material 216 (e.g., void containing, foamed, or other) to secure the insulating

                                                  8
material 216, or may be secured by any other adhesive or sealing method. If the outer wall 104
is permanently attached to the container 100 during manufacture (e.g., creating an integrated
double wall cup or double wall sleeve), it may increase efficiency by eliminating an assembly
step by the commercial end-user. Further, it may decrease the amount of storage space required
by the commercial end-user, e.g., storing one item as opposed to two.
[0038] The outer wall 104 may be removable from the container. For example, a die cut blank,
such as a sleeve, may be manufactured to be stored separately and removable from the container
100.
[0039] The outer wall 104 may remain open ended on one side or on opposing sides, which
may permit airflow. For example, in FIG. 3 the container may contain openings 302 near the top
of the outer wall 104. For example, in FIG. 4, the container may contain openings 402 near the
top or bottom 404 of the outer wall 104. The opening may be formed into the outer wall 104, for
example as holes, and air channels may be created allowing air flow when the space between the
inner wall 102 and the outer wall 104 is expanded by activation of the insulating material 216.
Airflow may be further manipulated, for example, upward and away from the holding fingers by
corrugated, flute corrugated, or other air channels created by the interaction of the insulating
material 216 and the outer wall 104 or expandable material application pattern 216. For
example, the pattern of application of the insulating material 216 may create air channels 304,
402.
[0040] FIG. 3 illustrates an alternate non-limiting example of how application of the insulating
material 216 may form openings 302 near the top 306 of the container 100. The channels may
be formed by expansion of the insulating material 216. There may be openings on opposing
ends of the container 100, such as at the top 306 and the bottom 308. The openings may be
formed by wrapping the outer wall 104 on the container without completing the seal at the top
306 or bottom 308.
[0041] FIG. 5 illustrates a cross section of an outer wall 104, such as a sleeve, assembled with
the container 100. This figure is meant to be illustrative and not limiting. The cup may be
replaced with any container, for example, a press-formed tray, a soup tub, or a bulk beverage
container. The outer wall 104 may have an inner face 506 and an outer face 504. An insulating
material 216 may be applied to the inner face 506, the outer face 504, and/or to a surface

                                                   9
between 502 the inner face 506 and the outer face 504, such as to an inner wall of the sleeve.
The inner face 506 and outer face 504 do not necessarily contain a space 502 between.
[0042] A insulating material 216, such as an expandable material, may be applied to an inner
face 506 of the outer wall 104 in an inactive form. The inactivated insulating material 216 may
be applied as a thin film that does not materially alter the thickness of the outer wall 104.
Applying the insulating material 216 to the inside of the outer wall 104 may also maintain the
printability of the outer face of the outer wall 104. If the inactivated insulating material 216 on
the outer wall 104 is assembled, for example, with a standard paper cup, it may maintain the
slim profile of the cup. Maintenance of the slim profile may retain the efficient nesting qualities
of a standard cup, allowing it to be efficiently cased, crated and shipped. Additionally, activation
of the insulating material 216 at end use may create manufacturing efficiencies by reducing the
activation or foaming or curing step during manufacturing of the container or sleeve and thereby
also reducing energy used during manufacturing.
[0043] The insulating material 216 may be activated and thereby expanded by, for example,
adding contents 206, such as hot liquid, beverage or food into the container 100. Alternatively or
additionally, the container 100 may be prefilled with contents 206, such as beverage or food and
the insulating material 216 may be activated upon heating such as by microwave or water bath.
Activation may occur only at the consumption stage and not at the processing stage of the outer
wall 104, such that the outer wall 104 may be shipped to the consumer with a substantially
inactivated insulating material 216. For example, the activation point of the insulating material
216 may be about 120 op or higher and/or less than 60 'F, such that the insulating material 216
may be activated only by the temperature of hot (or cold) liquids, beverages, or food and not
activated by ambient or body temperature. The activation may cause the expandable material to
expand and "push back" the outer wall 104 from the container 100 creating an increased air gap.
The air gap may create a thermal barrier between the hot beverage container 100 and the hand of
the consumer. The activation may also enhance the stiffness and/or rigidity of the container,
which may allow for a reduction in the material or thickness of the container wall. As described
in more detail below, the insulating material 216 may also be activated, or at least partially
activated, before reaching the consumer. Consequently, this ability of the insulating material 216
to respond to target temperature can make the container or sleeve "smart" in the sense that it can
increase its insulation as the packaged content 206 gets hotter.

                                                  10
[0044] The insulating material 216 may be applied to the outer wall 104 in an unexpanded
state. Expansion of the insulating material 216 may not occur until activated by adding hot fluid
or solids, such as at the point of serving. This may be different from expanding the material
during manufacture of the outer wall 104. Expansion during manufacture may increase the bulk
of the outer wall 104. The insulating material 216 may be controlled to effect nesting efficiency.
The properties of the insulating material 216 may be further controlled by, for example but not
limited to, combining a outer wall 104 constructed from fluted corrugate material with patterned
application of insulating material 216 to provide specific insulation, air flow characteristics and
container rigidity enhancement. For example, the corrugation and/or the pattern of insulating
material 216 applied to the outer wall 104 may direct heat convection upward, and may
therefore reduce heat transfer horizontally toward the holding hand of consumer. Alternatively,
the insulating material 216 may be extruded into a sheet to which a pattern may be applied, such
as by fluting, die-cutting shapes, lines, channels, or other markings into the sheet before
attaching the sheet of insulating material 216 to an outer wall 104. In other implementations,
expansion may occur before shipping, such as before, during or after the manufacturing of the
container 100.
[0045] FIG. 6 is an exemplary top view of a cross-section of a container 100 assembled with an
outer wall 104. This figure is illustrative only and not limiting. The insulating material 216 may
be applied to an outer wall 104. For example, the insulating material 216 may be applied
between the outer wall 104 and the wall of the container 100 and may form an integrated two
layer cup with thermally activatable insulated expandable material in between, or between an
outer wall 104 and an inner wall of a container sleeve. The insulating material 216 may include,
for example, in situ air voids, or expandable microspheres or foaming agents 602 dispersed in a
binder or any other suitable material disclosed above and may include an adhesive property.
[0046] FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary method of applying the insulating material 216 to a
container 100. The method may be adapted to a cup wrapping machine. In this example, the
insulating material 216 may be applied continuously or intermittently via an applicator 706 such
as a nozzle, glue gun, or slot die applicator onto the outside of, e.g., a paper cup 100 which may
be secured to a mandrel 702. The pattern may be manipulated by movement of the container 100
relative to the applicator 706. For example, the mandrel 702 may be spun and/or moved up or
down or in another direction to achieve a desired pattern, e.g., spiral, dotted, lined, and etc.

                                                  11
[0047] Alternatively or additionally, the applicator 706 may move relative to the container 100
to achieve a desired pattern. For example, mandrels 702 may be arranged on a rotating arm 700.
Containers 100 such as cups may be loaded onto the mandrel 702 manually or by machine feed.
The arm 700 may move the container 100 proximate to the applicator 706. The applicator 706
may apply patterns of insulating material 216 to the container 100 by moving relative to the
container 100. The mandrel 702 may also move the container 100 relative to the applicator 706,
such as by rotation. As an example, stripes may be applied to the cup by side to side movement
of the applicator 706 combined with rotational movement of the mandrel 702. The spray from
the applicator 706 may be constant or intermittent and may create broken lines, stripes, dots, or
ellipses of foam. Swirls may be applied by constant spray from the applicator 706 combined
with side movement and rotation of the mandrel 702.
[0048] The applicator 706 may be attached to a line which may deliver the insulating material
216. Gas, such as nitrogen gas, may be added to the insulating material 216 by a separate line
and mixed in the applicator 706, or during application, or in the applicator feed line, or
otherwise.
[0049] After the insulating material 216 has been applied, the arm 700 may move the container
100 to a different position where the cup may be removed from the mandrel for further
processing. For example, an integrated double wall container, such as a cup, may be formed by
inserting the container 100 into an outer wall 104. The outer wall 104 may be preformed and
located in a cavity 704 into which the container 100 may be inserted.
[0050] FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary outer wall 104 blank. This drawing is illustrative and not
meant to be limited to a size or shape. The size and shape may be adapted to the dimensions of
any container. An insulating material 216 may be applied to the outer wall 104. The insulating
material 216 may be applied by a number of methods, such as but not limited to, a nozzle spray
gun, printing, a slot coater, or other methods, such as those described above or in more detail
below. Alternatively or additionally, the insulating material 216 may be extruded into a sheet
and may be applied to a container, container sleeve, or die cut blank by laminating the sheet of
insulating material to the blank of the container, container sleeve, or die cut blank. The
insulating material 216 may be applied to the outer wall 104, for example, on an in-line cup
wrapping machine, in-line on a folder/gluer, or by other suitable methods, such as off-line
coating and drying. The insulating material 216 may be applied to the outer wall 104 in any

                                                  12
suitable pattern, such as but not limited to, banded, dotted, waved, squares, circles, diamonds,
random, a combination of these or any other pattern. For example, the insulating material 216
may be applied in a pattern that manipulates air flow and/or conducts heat, for example,
vertically upward away from the holding fingers. The insulating material 216 may be applied
such that it forms channels, or expands to form channels on activation. The channels may direct
natural convection. The insulating material 216 may fully or only partially cover the surface
being coated.
[0051] The outer wall 104 may be removably or permanently attached to a container 100 or cup
by, for example, wrapping the outer wall 104 around the container 100. For example, a double
wall cup or container 100 may be manufactured by laminating the outer wall 104 onto the
container, using an insulating material 216 such as a starch based material, a hot melt and
expandable material, an expandable material with adhesive properties, a combination of these or
any other adhesive or sealing method. If the outer wall 104 is permanently attached to the
container 100 during manufacture (for example, creating an integrated double wall cup), it may
increase the efficiency of using an outer wall 104 by eliminating an assembly step by the
commercial end-user. Further, it may decrease the amount of storage space required by the
commercial end-user (storing one item as opposed to two). The shape of the outer wall 104 in
the drawing is not meant to be limiting. The shape of the outer wall 104 may be adapted to the
shape of other containers, for example but not limited to, a container sleeve, a soup tub, press
formed container, or bulk beverage containers. Alternatively the container 100 may be a
container sleeve that is open on both ends.
[0052] The outer wall 104 may, optionally, contain in-seam hot-melt or cold-set glue. If the
insulating material 216 is also an adhesive, the in-seam hot-melt or cold-set may be omitted. The
in-seam hot-melt/cold-set glue may be used in addition to the insulating material 216, such as,
for bonding reinforcement. The outer wall 104 may be applied to a container 100, such as a cup
or sleeve by, for example, wrapping, laminating, or other manufacturing processes.
[0053] FIGS. 8 through 12 illustrate many examples of an outer wall 104. These examples are
merely illustrative and not limiting. FIG. 8 illustrates outer wall 104 with insulating material 216
applied in a pattern 809 to channel the release of heat. The insulating material 216 may be made
of, for example, corrugated paper, such as but not limited to fluted corrugate. Convection may

                                                  13
be manipulated by corrugation, the pattern of application of the insulating material 216, or in
another suitable manner.
[0054] FIGS. 9 through 10 illustrate other possible, non-limiting examples of potential patterns
of insulating material 216. The patterns of insulating material 216 are represented by numbers
909 and 1009, respectively. The insulating material 216 may be applied in patterns other than
those illustrated in FIGS. 8-10. The insulating material 216, may vary in thickness and may
provide graduated flow to channel heat to openings.
[0055] FIGS. 11-14 illustrate patterns of openings that may be used to allow air flow. Openings
are represented by numbers 1112, 1212, 1312, and 1412, respectively. Openings may also be
located and/or include shapes such as illustrated by numbers 1214, 1314, and 1414. There may
be die cut openings at opposing ends of the blank, or only at one end. The shapes of the
openings in Figs. 11-14 are illustrative only and not limiting. For example, the patterns of
insulating material 216 and the shape of the openings may be so arranged as to manipulate air
flow, for example but not limited to, creating a Venturi effect.
[0056] FIG. 15 is an illustrative example showing exemplary heat transfer. This example is not
meant to be limiting, but merely illustrative of possible heat loss manipulation. Total heat loss of
the system may be represented by the following equation:
[0057] QT [Cal./second] = QIiQ2+Q3+Q4
[0058] Where QT is the total heat loss. Qi 1504 may be the heat loss due to water evaporation.
Q2, Q3,  and Q4, represented by 1502, 1506, and 1508, respectively, may represent the
convectional and conductional heat loss.
[0059] The objective of keeping contents hot may be achieved by minimizing QT. The outer
wall 104 may minimize QT by minimizing Q2, Q3, and Q4. The low thermal conductivity of the
insulating material may result in much lower heat loss due to Q2,   Q3, and Q4.
[0060] The objective of preventing consumer flesh bums may be achieved by, for example,
minimizing Q2,   Q3,  and Q4, especially Q2, Q3, while allowing Qi  and Q4 to channel the
unavoidable high heat flux (due to the hot liquid) vertically up or down This may be achieved

                                                  14
by, for example, adding cormugated grooves to the outer wall I04. The grooves may be, for
example, in a generally vertical or diagonally tilted.
[0061] Non-limiting examples follow.
[0062] Example 1 Example 1 provides a graphical representation of how the insulating
material 216 may alter thermal conductivity. The temperature on the inside of a cup may be
represented by Ti. The temperature on the outside of the cup may be represented by To. The top
line, X, may represent a container without the coated outer wall 104. The second line, Y, may
represent a container assembled with a coated outer wall 104. This example may illustrate thad,
ina container without an outer wall 104 coated with the insulating material 216, the difference
in the temperature inside versus the outside of the container may be very small. Ina container
with a outer wall 104 coated with the insulating material 216, the difference in the temperature
between inside and outside may be small when the hot food or beverage is added to the
container. However, the food or beverage may activate the material, A, on contact, causing the
material to expand. When the material expands, the difference in temperature Ti-To, may
increase.

[0063] Example 2. Example 2 illustrates temperature sensory comparison ofvarious outer wall
 104 materials coated with the insulating material 216 compared to without the insulating
material 216. The following experiment is for illustration only and is not limiting, otter
experimental results might be obtained.

                                                 15
[0064] An insulating material 216, such as a thermally, or other, expandable material may be
applied to outer wal 104 blanks made of various materials, such as but not limited to paper,
paperboard, and fluted corrugated paper. Each outer wall 104 blank may be wrapped around a
container, such as a cup. The cup may be filled with hot water. The cups may then be handled
with bare hands and a comparison made between the sensory responses to the two conditions. In
each test, the cups with coated outer wall 104 were less "hot" to the touch than those with
uncoated outer wal l 104. Expansion occurred within a few minutes of pouring hot water into
the cup.
[0065] Example 3. Coatings of insulating material 216 may be applied to a single face medium.
The coating may be expanded when wet using a MASTER-MITE 120 V, 475 Wheat gun at 600
degrees F.
[0066] Example 4. Coatings of insulating material 216 may be applied to the outside of a 12 Oz
cup and allowed to air-dry overnight. The next day, 190 degree F hot water may be poured into
the cup. Noticeable expansion may be observed shortly after filing the 190 degree F hot water
into the cup. Lids may be placed on the cup, and after 7 minutes more expansion may be
observed, but still partial expansion. A benefit of post -heat activation may be that the hotter the
liquid the more the coating expands.
[0067] Example 5. A coating of an insulating material 216 was applies to a cup. A 250 W IR
heater manufactured by Fisher Scientific model no. 11-504-50 may be used to heat the
insulating material 216. Expansion may be slow when the lamp is six inches away from the
insulating material 216 and immediate when one inch away from the insulating material 216.
[0068] Example 6. Coatings of insulating material 216 may be applied to paper, which may
them be wrapped around a paper cup after the coating is allowed to air dry. Heat from a heat gun
may be used to heat the part of the insulating material 216 coating indirectly through the paper
shell for one minute. The coating expanded. Another part of the unheated insulating material
216 coating may be heated under an IR lamp through the paper. The insulating material 216
coating expanded.
[0069] Example 7. An insulating material 216, such as a heat expandable coating, may be
applied within the walls of a double wall sleeve or container, such as a cup. During manufacture,
the insulating material 216 may be adequately dried but not expanded, or not fully expanded.

                                                   16
When the sleeve or container is exposed to high temperature, such as the temperature of coffee
or soup, the insulating material 216 may expand pushing the walls of the double wall sleeve or
container away from each other. This expansion through activation may "smarly" increase the
air voids in the insulating material 216 as well as the insulation and rigidity of the package. The
following details an experiment illustrating how use of the insulating material 216 decreases a
weight of amaterial used in the manufacture of a container or container sleeve. Although the
experiment employs a limited set of materials, they demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of
the insulating material 216.
{00701 Two samples were compared. The reference container was a l6 ounce disposable cup
with a l6pt outer wrap. The experimental container was a 16 ounce disposable cup with a
pattern of insulating material 216, in this case a foam coating, and a 12pt outer wrap. Both cups
were filled with 190F water. The insulating material 216 of the experimental container expanded
upon addition of the 190F water. The outer surface temperature of each cup was measured and
plotted below. The experimental cup displayed improved insulating properties during the first
few minutes of the experiment.

{007 1] A second trial illustrated the use of container sleeves. The reference container sleeve
was an N-flute single face sleeve. The experimental container sleeve was an N-flute single face

                                                  17
sleeve with an inside layer of insulating material 216, in this case, foam coating. A layer of kraft
paper was laminated over the layer of insulating material 216 and the material was dried, but not
expanded. The insulating material 216 was applied in two patterns: full coverage and lines
running from the top to the bottom of the sleeve. To summarize, there were five formats of
container sleeves tested:
[0072] N-flute single face sleeve with inner layer of kraft paper
[0073] N-flute single face sleeve with inner layer of dried non-expanded heat activatable
aqueous coating ("AP") and an inner layer of kraft paper
[0074] N-flute single face sleeve with inner layer of expanded heat activatable aqueous coating
and no layer of kraft paper

arranged in vertical lines and inner layer of kraft paper
[0076] N-flute single face sleeve with a full coverage inner layer of expanded heat activatable
aqueous coating and inner layer of kraft paper
[0077] The sleeves were applied to a 16oz disposable cup which was filled with 190F water.
After filling, the temperature of the outside of the cup was tested at one minute intervals for 5
minutes. The results are charted below.

[0078] The cups and sleeves containing the foam coatings also bad higher rigidity, even at a
reduced paper stock. The patterned foamed coating prevented even the 12 pt outer wrap from
collapsing into the inner wall during handling. This may allow the use of lower basis weight and
caliper paper board while maintaining good insulation.
[0079] Fig. 16 is a block diagram of an exemplary process for applying a micro-particle coating
to substrates. The process may include applying a microsphere or other expandable coating to
any of a substrate, die cut blank, container, sleeve, catering trays, double-wall cups, press
formed tray, soup tub and bag-in-the box containers. The process may include inline 1600 and
off-line 1610 procedures. The inline procedure 1600 may include stacking stations 1620,
manufacturing stations 1630, and packaging stations 1640 used for the manufacturing of the
container from paper or die cut stock. The stacking, manufacturing and packaging stations ny
be completely automated and/or include manual stations.
[0080] Coating application processes may occur in-line 160 or offline 1610, at the same or
another facility. [n-line application may include the application of the insulating material 216 at
one or more of the stacking stations 1620, manufacturing stations 1630, and packaging stations
 1640. The insulating material 216 may be applied in various ways, including but not limited to
brushes, sponges, printing, a nozzle, spray, a slot die cater, or by lamination to an extruded
sheet of coating. Any of tbese applications, or various combinations of them, may occur in-line
1600 or offline 1610, where the off-line process may occur before the stacking stage 1620.

                                                 19
[0081] Application with a brush or brushes may occur by feeding the insulating material with
pressure through a tube to the brush. The brush may be manufactured from different materials
such as horse hair or synthetic materials. The brush may include hollow filaments such that the
insulating material is applied through the filaments. The brush may apply a swatch or pattern of
the insulating material. The amount of insulating material to the brush may be controlled such
that the amount of insulating material applied to the substrate may be metered. As an illustrative
and not limiting example, the amount may be controlled such that a 1 / 64 th inch layer of
insulating material is applied, which may expand to 1/16 or 1/32 of an inch, or the distance of
the gap between an inner and outer layer of a double-wall cup. It may be preferable that the
insulating material does not deform a shape of the outer layer once expanded. The insulating
material 216 may be distributed in a uniform or varying pattern. The brush may be used for
broader applications, such as to coat the inside of a bag-in-the-box container.
[0082] Application with a printing press may occur by running substrates through rollers. The
substrates may be roll or web form of paper stock, or alternatively in sheet form. The insulating
material 216 may be press applied in spots or patterns or with full coverage, depending on an
implementation.
[0083] In Fig. 17, spray nozzles 1700 may be used to apply a insulating material 216 to a
substrate 1720. The nozzles may diffuse the insulating material to apply a thin, uniform layers of
the insulating material 216 on the substrate. One or more spray nozzles may be used to form
continuous or interrupted patterns of the insulating material 216. The nozzles may be arranged
such that the applied insulating materials 216 overlap, are side-by-side and/or are separated by a
space. The spray may be metered to control a thickness of the applied insulating material 216.
The nozzle may also be positioned to direct spray of the insulating material 216 onto designated
portions of the substrate, such as at a corner.
[0084] In Fig. 18, non-spray nozzles 1800 may be used to apply a stream 1810 of insulating
material 216 to the substrate 1820. The stream may be metered through the nozzle to apply a
precise amount. The nozzle may be sized to control a specified width and height of the stream
1810. Flow from the nozzles may be turned on and off to accommodate a specified pattern of
the insulating material 216 to the substrate.

                                                 20
[0085] In a trough or a dip insulating material 216 application, substrates may be moved
through the trough that contains insulating material 216. One or both sides of the substrate may
be run through the trough. A thickness of the insulating material 216 being applied to the trough
may be controlled by how long the substrate sits in the material. A temperature of the insulating
material 216 and substrate may be controlled to activate or not activate the expandable
insulating material 216 during the application process. A control blade may be used to meter off
excess insulating material 216. The substrates may be belt fed though the through or
individually held in the through.
[0086] With any of the above application processes, and with any other process, the applied
insulating material 216 may be dried or set, such as by applying or blowing cool air or warm air
without activating the insulating material 216, if it is desired to expand the insulating material
216 in a later process, such as during manufacturing or at the time of consumer use. The
insulating material 216 may also be expanded after manufacturing and before consumer use,
such as at the stacking station. The insulating material 216 may be expanded before or after
stacking the containers.
[0087] Coated or uncoated blanks may be fed to the stacking station. The insulating material
216 may be applied during in-line or off-line processing. If applied in-line, the insulating
material 216 may be allowed to dry before the cups, sleeves, containers, etc. are formed, or they
may be formed while the insulating material 216 is wet. Depending on the properties of the
insulating material 216, it may take a couple of seconds to several minutes to dry. The insulating
material 216 may be activated during the in-line manufacturing or afterwards, such as at the
consumer stage. To activate the insulating material 216 in-line, any or all of infrared (IR), air,
convection or conductive heating methods may be used. The insulating material 216 may take a
couple of seconds to several minutes to fully expand. For example, a mandrel, which holds a
container from the inside of the container, and/or a collar, which holds a cup from the outside of
the container, may be used to apply heat to expand the insulating material 216 during the
container manufacturing process. If a wet or partially dry insulating material 216 contacts the
mandrel during process, the mandrel may be manufactured to include a non-stick material, such
as TEFLON to prevent sticking or transfer of the insulating material 216 onto the mandrel.
Lower activation temperatures may be preferred if the activation occurs in-line. By activating
the insulating material 216, the insulating material 216 expands to form a reinforced air gap. The

                                                 21
insulating material 216 may be partially expanded during manufacturing of the container, and
then the expansion may continue to the consumption stage.
[0088] As mentioned, use of the insulating material 216 may help to reduce the thickness of
substrate needed to make the container, sleeves, etc., while maintaining a better rigid feel to the
consumer. The insulating material 216 may also improve insulation properties of the container,
and to help keep the beverages or foods warm or cold longer, depending on the application. The
substrates may be made of natural fibers, synthetic or both, such as SBS (solid bleached sulfate)
paper board or box board. A sleeve materials, such as liner and medium, may be produced of
15LB/3000ft2 to 100LB/3000ft2 material, and preferably 18LB/3000ft2 to 50LB/3000ft 2 . The
caliper of the paper substrate for hot or cold cups, soup tub, press-formed container and other
non-corrugated containers may range from 9 point to 24 point, and preferably 10 point to 24
point, where a point is equal to 1/1000 inch.
[0089] While various embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be apparent to
those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible
that are within the scope of the invention.
