CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]                      This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.
62/424,161, filed November 18, 2016, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference
in its entirety and to which priority is claimed.
BACKGROUND
[0002]                      The present invention relates to a mining shovel, and more specifically to a ground
engagement tooling system for the dipper of a mining shovel.
[0003]                      Industrial mining machines, such as electric rope or power shovels, draglines, etc.,
are used to execute digging operations to remove material from a bank of a mine. On a
conventional rope shovel, a dipper is attached to a handle, and the dipper is supported by a cable,
or rope, that passes over a boom sheave. The rope is secured to a bail that is pivotably coupled to
the dipper. The handle is moved along a saddle block to maneuver a position of the dipper.
During a hoist phase, the rope is reeled in by a winch in a base of the machine, lifting the dipper
upward through the bank and liberating the material to be dug.                 To release the material disposed
within the dipper, a dipper door is pivotally coupled to the dipper. When not latched to the
dipper, the dipper door pivots away from a bottom of the dipper, thereby freeing the material out
through a bottom of the dipper.
[0004]                      The dipper often includes ground engagement tooling, including adapters, tooth
points, and/or shrouds that are coupled to a lip of the dipper. The ground engagement tooling is
used to dig through the bank of material, and to absorb a significant amount of the overall wear
experienced by the dipper. Current adapters and shrouds are coupled directly to the lip with legs
that straddle over both a top and bottom of the lip. The legs provide the dual purpose of both
structurally supporting the adapter or shroud to the lip and also providing added material wear
protection along the top and bottom of the lip, in addition to the wear protection already afforded
by a portion of the adapter or shroud that extends forward from the lip.

SUMMARY
[0005]                      In accordance with one construction, a tooling system includes a dipper having a
lip with a plurality of apertures, the apertures extending at least partially through the lip. The
tooling system also includes a modular adapter configured to be inserted partially into one of the
apertures along an axis of insertion. The adapter is configured to be releasably coupled to the lip.
The adapter includes a first portion configured to extend into the aperture, and a second portion
configured to extend out of the aperture. The tooling system also includes a locking system
including a fastener configured to extend at least partially into the aperture and couple to the
adapter to the lip.
[0006]                      In accordance with another construction, an adapter configured to be releasably
coupled to a lip of a dipper includes a first portion and a second portion extending from the first
portion. The first portion is configured to be inserted along an axis into a first aperture in the lip.
A second aperture extends through the first portion. The second aperture is configured to receive
a fastener.
[00071                      Other aspects of the invention will become apparent by consideration of the
detailed description and accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0018]                      Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be
understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the
arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following
drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being
carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology
used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limited.
[0019]               FIG. 1 illustrates a power shovel 10. The shovel 10 includes a mobile base 15, drive
tracks 20, a turntable 25, a revolving frame 30, a boom 35, a lower end 40 of the boom 35 (also
called a boom foot), an upper end 45 of the boom 35 (also called a boom point), tension cables
50, a gantry tension member 55, a gantry compression member 60, a sheave 65 rotatably
mounted on the upper end 45 of the boom 35, a dipper 70, a dipper door 75 pivotally coupled to
the dipper 70, a hoist rope 80, a winch drum (not shown), a dipper handle 85, a saddle block 90, a

                                                         4
shipper shaft 95, and a transmission unit (also called a crowd drive, not shown). The rotational
structure 25 allows rotation of the upper frame 30 relative to the lower base 15. The turntable 25
defines a rotational axis 100 of the shovel 10. The rotational axis 100 is perpendicular to a plane
105 defined by the base 15 and generally corresponds to a grade of the ground or support surface.
[0020]               The mobile base 15 is supported by the drive tracks 20. The mobile base 15 supports
the turntable 25 and the revolving frame 30. The turntable 25 is capable of 360-degrees of
rotation relative to the mobile base 15. The boom 35 is pivotally connected at the lower end 40
to the revolving frame 30. The boom 35 is held in an upwardly and outwardly extending relation
to the revolving frame 30 by the tension cables 50, which are anchored to the gantry tension
member 55 and the gantry compression member 60. The gantry compression member 60 is
mounted on the revolving frame 30.
[0021]               The dipper 70 is suspended from the boom 35 by the hoist rope 80. The hoist rope 80
is wrapped over the sheave 65 and attached to the dipper 70 at a bail 110. The hoist rope 80 is
anchored to the winch drum (not shown) of the revolving frame 30. The winch drum is driven by
at least one electric motor (not shown) that incorporates a transmission unit (not shown). As the
winch drum rotates, the hoist rope 80 is paid out to lower the dipper 70 or pulled in to raise the
dipper 70. The dipper handle 85 is also coupled to the dipper 70. The dipper handle 85 is
slidably supported in the saddle block 90, and the saddle block 90 is pivotally mounted to the
boom 35 at the shipper shaft 95. The dipper handle 85 includes a rack and tooth formation
thereon that engages a drive pinion (not shown) mounted in the saddle block 90. The drive
pinion is driven by an electric motor and transmission unit (not shown) to extend or retract the
dipper handle 85 relative to the saddle block 90.
[0022]               An electrical power source (not shown) is mounted to the revolving frame 30 to
provide power to a hoist electric motor (not shown) for driving the hoist drum, one or more
crowd electric motors (not shown) for driving the crowd transmission unit, and one or more
swing electric motors (not shown) for turning the turntable 25. Each of the crowd, hoist, and
swing motors is driven by its own motor controller, or is alternatively driven in response to
control signals from a controller (not shown).

                                                               5
[00231                      FIGS. 2-10 illustrate a modular ground engagement tooling system 200 for use
with the shovel machine 10 or with other mining machines. The modular ground engagement
tooling system 200 includes a dipper 205 having a lip 210, and a plurality of modular adapters
215 and modular shrouds 220 that are releasably coupled to the lip 210 through apertures 225 in
the lip 210.
[0024]                      In some constructions, the dipper 70 of the shovel 10 may be replaced with the
dipper 205. In other constructions, the dipper 70 is retrofitted to include the apertures 225 to
receive the various modular adapters 215 and modular shrouds 220. In yet other constructions, a
mining machine is initially constructed to include the dipper 205.
[0025]                      With reference to FIG. 4, in the illustrated construction the lip 210 includes
thirteen apertures 225 spaced evenly apart from one another. Other constructions include
different numbers and arrangements of apertures 225 than that illustrated. For example, in some
constructions, fewer than thirteen apertures 225 are provided. In some constructions, more than
thirteen apertures 225 are provided. In some constructions, the apertures 225 are spaced
differently than that illustrated. In some constructions, at least one of the apertures 225 is of a
different size and/or shape than that illustrated. In some constructions, all of the apertures 225
are of identical size and shape, whereas in other constructions, at least one of the apertures 225 is
of a different size and/or shape than another of the apertures 225.
[0026]                      With reference to FIGS. 2-4, and 8-10, each of the apertures 225 extends entirely
through the lip 210 from a first, outer side 230 of the lip 210 to a second, opposite inner side 235
of the lip 210. As illustrated in FIG. 9, the apertures 225 vary in diameter moving from the first
side 230 of the lip 210 to the second side 235 of the lip 210. In the illustrated construction, the
apertures 225 each have a first diameter 240 adjacent the first side 230, a second diameter 245
between the first and second sides 230, 235, and a third diameter 250 adjacent the second side
235. In the illustrated construction, the first diameter 240 is larger than both the second diameter
245 and the third diameter 250, and the second diameter 245 is smaller than both the first
diameter 240 and the third diameter 250.

                                                               6
[00271                      With reference to FIG. 3, in the illustrated construction the dipper 205 includes
reinforcing elements 255 positioned along a bottom 260 of the dipper 205. The reinforcing
elements 255 are elongate ribs that are spaced evenly apart from one another and extend parallel
to one another along the dipper 205. The reinforcing elements 255 extend along the bottom 260
of the dipper 205 to the inner side 235 of the lip 210. The reinforcing elements 255 alternate with
the apertures 225, such that a single reinforcing element 255 is positioned between any two of the
apertures 225 when viewed along a direction that is perpendicular to the inner side 235 of the lip
210. Other constructions include different sizes, shapes, and arrangements of reinforcing
elements 255 than that illustrated. In some constructions, the dipper 205 does not include
reinforcing elements 255.
[0028]                      With reference to FIGS. 5-9, each of the modular adapters 215 includes a first
portion 265 sized and shaped to fit into any one of the apertures 225, and a second portion 270
extending from the first portion 265 that is sized and shaped to extend out of the aperture 225. In
the illustrated construction, the first portion 265 is an elongate stem sized and shaped to slide into
one of the apertures 225, and to provide structural support and stability for the modular adapter
215 on the dipper 205 (e.g., as opposed to using legs straddling opposite sides of a lip of a dipper
as found in current adapters). The first portion 265 tapers in cross-sectional area, such that the
first portion 265 has a larger cross-sectional area closer to the second portion 270 than away from
the second portion 270. In the illustrated construction, the first portion 265 has an overall size
and shape that is approximately equal to a size and shape of at least one of the apertures 225,
such that the first portion 265 generally maintains a frictional fit inside of the aperture 225 once
inserted into the aperture 225. As illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6, in some constructions the first
portion 265 has a generally clover-shaped cross-section. However, other constructions include
various other shapes and sizes than that illustrated. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 7 in some
constructions the modular adapter 215 has a first portion 265 with a circular cross-sectional
shape.
[0029]                      With continued reference to FIGS. 5-9, the second portion 270 includes a central
body 275 and a mating projection 280 that extends from the central body 275 and is sized and
shaped to couple to a tooth point 285. The first portion 265 of the modular adapter 215 extends

                                                            7
from the central body 275. The central body 275 has a larger cross-sectional area than both the
first portion 265 and the aperture 225, such that when the modular adapter 215 is coupled to the
lip 210, the central body 275 abuts against the first outer side 230 of the lip 210 (FIGS. 8 and 9).
The mating projection 280 has a smaller cross-sectional area than the central body 275, and
generally tapers in cross-sectional area moving away from the central body 275. As illustrated in
FIG. 9, the mating projection 280 is sized and shaped to fit into a correspondingly-shaped female
recess 290 of the tooth point 285. The tooth point 285 absorbs wear from material dug up by the
shovel 10, and is held onto the mating projection 280 and the modular adapter 215 via any of a
number of different mechanisms or techniques. For example, in some constructions, the tooth
point 285 is held onto the mating projection 280 purely via a frictional fit. In other constructions,
a pin or other structure (e.g., a commercially available structure or system) is used to hold the
tooth point 285 onto the modular adapter 215. In some constructions the tooth point 285 is a
commercially available tooth point.
[0030]                      With continued reference to FIGS. 5-9, the modular adapter 215 includes an
adapter aperture 295 that extends from the first portion 265 of the modular adapter 215 to the
second portion 270 of the modular adapter 215. As illustrated in FIG. 9, the adapter aperture 295
is a through-aperture having a first region 300 with a first diameter 305 and a second region 310
with a second diameter 315. In some constructions, the first region 300 is threaded. The second
diameter 315 is larger than the first diameter 305. The adapter aperture 295 extends from an end
surface 320 of the first portion 265 to an inclined surface 325 of the mating projection 280, along
an axis 330 (FIG. 9). As illustrated in FIG. 9, the axis 330 is identical to an axis of insertion of
the first portion 265 into the aperture 225 of the lip 210.
[0031]                      With continued reference to FIG. 9, the modular ground engagement tooling
system 200 includes a locking system 335 that releasably locks the modular adapter 215 to the lip
210. In the illustrated construction, the locking system 335 includes a fastener 340 (e.g., threaded
bolt) that is shaped and sized to extend into the adapter aperture 295 of the modular adapter 215.
The fastener 340 includes a first portion 345 having a diameter equal to or less than the first
diameter 305 of the adapter aperture 295, and a second portion 350 (e.g., a head) having a
diameter greater than the first diameter 305 and equal to or less than the second diameter 315 of
9699398_1 (GHMatters) P107340.AU

                                                             8
the adapter aperture 295. The fastener 340 may be inserted through the adapter aperture 295 at
the inclined surface 325 until the second portion 350 reaches a transition between the first region
300 and the second region 310 of the adapter aperture 295, where the second portion 350 is then
prevented from further translation along the axis 330. In some constructions, the second portion
350 is a head that receives a tool to push, thread, or otherwise move the fastener 340 through the
adapter aperture 295.
[0032]                      With continued reference to FIG. 9, the locking system 335 also includes a nut
355 (e.g., threaded) that receives the fastener 340. As illustrated in FIG. 8, the nut 355 has a
diameter that is greater than the second diameter 245 of the aperture 225 of the lip 210. By
rotating the fastener 340 through the nut 355, and/or rotating the nut 355 over the fastener 340,
the fastener 340 and the nut 355 are tightened relative to one another, and the modular adapter
215 is pulled tightly against the first, outer side 230 of the lip 210.
[00331                      With reference to FIG. 10, each of the modular shrouds 220 includes a first
portion 360 sized and shaped to fit into any one of the apertures 225, and a second portion 365
extending from the first portion 360 that is sized and shaped to extend out of the aperture 225. In
the illustrated construction, the first portion 360 is an elongate stem sized and shaped to slide into
one of the apertures 225. The first portion 360 tapers in cross-sectional area, such that the first
portion 360 has a larger cross-sectional area closer to the second portion 365 than away from the
second portion 365. In the illustrated construction, the first portion 360 has an overall size and
shape that is approximately equal to a size and shape of at least one of the apertures 225, such
that the first portion 360 generally maintains a frictional fit inside of the aperture 225.
[0034]                      With continued reference to FIG. 10, the second portion 365 includes a central
body 370 and a wear projection 375 that extends from the central body 370. The first portion 360
of the modular shroud 220 extends from the central body 370. As illustrated in FIG. 10, the
central body 370 has a larger cross-sectional area than both the first portion 360 and the aperture
225 in the lip 210, such that when the modular shroud 220 is coupled to the lip 210, the central
body 370 abuts against the first outer side 230 of the lip 210. The wear projection 375 has a
smaller cross-sectional area than the central body 370, and generally tapers in cross-sectional area
9699398_1 (GHMatters) P107340.AU

                                                             9
moving away from the central body 370. As illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 10, the wear projection
375 remains exposed outside of the lip 210, so as to absorb wear from the material dug up by the
shovel 10.
[0035]                      With continued reference to FIG. 10, the modular shroud 220 includes an aperture
380 that extends from the first portion 360 of the modular shroud 220 to the second portion 365
of the modular shroud 220. As illustrated in FIG. 10, the aperture 380 is a through-aperture
having a first region 385 with a first diameter 390 and a second region 395 with a second
diameter 400. In some constructions, the first region 385 is threaded. The second diameter 400
is larger than the first diameter 390. The aperture 380 extends from an end surface 405 of the
first portion 360 to an inclined surface 410 of the wear projection 375, along an axis 415. As
illustrated in FIG. 10, the axis 415 is identical to an axis of insertion of the first portion 360 into
the aperture 225 of the lip 210.
[00361                      With continued reference to FIG. 10, as well as to FIG. 9, the same locking system
335 that releasably locks the modular adapter 215 to the lip 210 may alternatively be used to
releasably lock the modular shroud 220 to the lip 210. Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 10, the
fastener 340 may be inserted through the aperture 380 at the inclined surface 410, and may be
coupled to the nut 355.
[00371                      FIGS. 11-13 illustrate a modular ground engagement tooling system 500 that
includes a dipper 505 having a lip 510, and separate wear components 515 coupled to the dipper
505 to further absorb wear from the material dug up by the shovel 10. The separate wear
components 515 each have a generally rectangular shape, and project upwardly from an interior
surface 520 of the dipper 505. Other constructions include different shapes and sizes than that
illustrated. In some constructions, the separate wear components 515 are integrally formed as
part of the dipper 505.
[0038]                      With continued reference to FIGS. 11-13, the modular ground engagement tooling
system 500 includes modular adapters 525 (FIGS. 11 and 12) and modular shrouds 530 (FIG. 13)
that each fit into any one of various apertures 535 in the lip 510, similar to the modular ground
engagement tooling system 200. As illustrated in FIGS. 11-13, the separate wear components
9699398_1 (GHMatters) P107340.AU

                                                             10
515 are spaced and positioned generally adjacent the modular adapters 525 and shrouds 530,
although other constructions include different locations. The modular ground engagement
tooling system 500 also includes locking systems 540 to releasably lock the modular adapters 525
and modular shrouds 530 to the lip 510. Additionally, and similar to the modular adapters 215
described above, the modular adapters 525 couple to tooth points 545. Description of the
modular adapters 525, modular shrouds 530, locking systems 540, and tooth points 545 are not
provided, since they are identical to those described above in the modular ground engagement
tooling system 200.
[0039]                      The use of separate wear components 515, in combination with the separate
modular adapters 525 and modular shrouds 530 themselves, allows for the overall wear
experienced by the dipper 505 to be divided amongst various components, and for each of the
components to be replaced as needed based on its own experienced wear. For example, in some
constructions the separate wear components 515 may wear slower than the modular adapters 525
or the modular shrouds 530 during use of the dipper 505. Thus, the modular adapters 525 and
modular shrouds 530 may be replaced as needed, while the separate wear components 515
remain in place.
[0040]                      FIG. 14 illustrates a modular ground engagement tooling system 600 that includes
a dipper 605 having a lip 610, and separate wear components 615 coupled to an interior surface
620 of the dipper 605 to further absorb wear from the material dug up by the shovel 10. The
modular ground engagement tooling system 600 includes modular adapters 625 (and modular
shrouds, not shown) that each fit into any one of various apertures 630 in the lip 610, similar to
the modular ground engagement tooling systems 200 and 500. As illustrated in FIG. 14, the
separate wear components 615 are spaced and positioned generally adjacent the modular adapters
625 and shrouds, although other constructions include different locations. The modular adapters
625 also couple to tooth points 640. Additionally, the modular ground engagement tooling
system 600 also includes a locking system 645 to releasably lock the modular adapter 625 (or
modular shroud) to the lip 610.
9699398_1 (GHMatters) P107340.AU

                                                            11
[00411                      With continued reference to FIG. 14, the aperture 630 extends from a first, outer
side 650 of the lip 610 to a second, opposite inner side 655 of the lip 610. The aperture 630 has a
first diameter 660 adjacent the first, outer side 650 and a smaller, second diameter 665 adjacent
the second, inner side 655. The aperture 630 tapers continuously between the first diameter 660
and the second diameter 665.
[0042]                      The locking system 645 includes a fastener 670 (e.g., a threaded bolt, similar or
identical to the fastener 340 described above) that is shaped and sized to extend into an aperture
675 (e.g., threaded aperture) of the modular adapter 625. As illustrated in FIG. 14, the aperture
675 is a blind bore that opens at an interior end of the modular adapter 625 within the lip 610.
The fastener 670 includes a first portion 680 (e.g., threaded) having a first diameter and a second
portion 685 (e.g., a head) having a second, larger diameter. In some constructions, the second
portion 685 is a head that receives a tool to push, thread, or otherwise move the fastener 670 into
the aperture 675.
[00431                      With continued reference to FIG. 14, the locking system 645 also includes a
washer 690 having a diameter larger than the second diameter 665 of the aperture 630 of the lip
610. To lock the modular adapter 625, the fastener 670 is moved into (e.g., threaded into) the
aperture 675 from behind the modular adapter 625 along a direction toward the tooth point 640.
As the fastener 670 is turned, the second portion 685 eventually contacts the washer 690, which
acts to prevent the second portion 685 from translating farther. As the fastener 670 is then
rotated again, the modular adapter 625 is forced to pull tightly against the first, outer side 650 of
the lip 610, thereby locking the modular adapter 625 to the lip 610.
[0044]               FIGS. 15-18 illustrate a modular ground engagement tooling system 700 that includes
a dipper 705 having a lip 710, separate wear components 725 (e.g. to absorb wear), and a
plurality of separate modular adapters 715 and modular shrouds 720 that are releasably coupled
to the lip 710 through apertures 730 in the lip 710. The modular adapters 715 are coupled to
tooth points 740. In the illustrated construction, the apertures 730 extend entirely through the lip
710, although in other constructions the apertures 730 extend only partially through the lip 710
(e.g., as blind bores). The modular ground engagement tooling system 700 also includes a
9699398_1 (GHMatters) P107340.AU

                                                          12
locking system 745 to releasably lock the modular adapters 715 and/or modular shrouds 720 to
the lip 710. The modular ground engagement tooling system 700 is similar to the modular
ground engagement tooling systems 200, 500, and 600, and only differences will be discussed
herein for the sake of brevity.
[0045]               With reference to FIGS. 16-18, each of the modular adapters 715 includes a first
portion 765 sized and shaped to fit into any one of the apertures 730, and a second portion 770
extending from the first portion 765 that is sized and shaped to extend out of the aperture 730. In
the illustrated construction, the first and second portions 765, 770 are each tapered, although
other constructions include different shapes and sizes than that illustrated. The first portion 765
includes a slot 750 oriented along an axis 840 that is perpendicular to an axis 845 along which the
modular adapter 715 is inserted through the aperture 730. The slot 750 extends entirely through
the first portion 765 along the axis 840. The second portion 770 includes a central body 775 and
a mating projection 780 that extends from the central body 775 and that is sized and shaped to
couple to the tooth point 740. Connecting apertures 755 extend into the mating projection 780
and are oriented along an axis 850 that is orthogonal to both the axis 840 and the axis 845. In
some constructions, the connecting apertures 755 together form a single through-aperture that
extends entirely through the mating projection 780.
[0046]               As illustrated in FIGS. 17 and 18, the mating projection 780 is sized and shaped to fit
into a correspondingly-shaped female recess 790 of the tooth point 740. The tooth point 740 is
held onto the mating projection 780 and the modular adapter 715 via pins 760 (FIG. 16) that are
inserted into the connecting apertures 755. The tooth point 740 has apertures 785 (FIG. 16) that
align with the connecting apertures 755 (FIG. 16) when the mating projection 780 is fit into the
female recess 790. In the illustrated construction, each pin 760 is inserted through one aperture
785 and one connecting aperture 755 to couple the tooth point 740 to the modular adapter 715.
Other constructions various other mechanisms (other pins, etc.) by which to couple the modular
adapter 715 to the tooth point 740.
[0047]               With continued reference to FIGS. 16 and 17, the locking system 745 includes a
fastener 795. In the illustrated construction the fastener 795 includes a first wedge element 855
9699398_1 (GHMatters) P107340.AU

                                                         13
with tabs 875 and a second wedge element 860. The locking system 745 further includes an
aperture 800 that extends into the dipper lip 710 (and in some embodiments further extends
through one of the separate wear components 725 on the lip 710). The aperture 800 intersects the
aperture 730 along an axis 870 that is parallel to, or coincident with, the axis 840.
[0048]               During assembly, the modular adapter 715 is inserted into the aperture 730 so that the
slot 750 is aligned with the aperture 800 along the axis 870. The fastener 795 is then inserted
through the aperture 800 and the slot 750 to couple the modular adapter 715 to the dipper lip 710.
For example, in some constructions the first wedge element 855 is inserted through the aperture
800 and the slot 750. The second wedge element 860 is then inserted (e.g., driven via a hammer
or other tool) through the aperture 800 and the slot 750. Rails 865 positioned on the second
wedge element 860 couple to rails (not shown) on the first wedge 855, thereby guiding and
coupling the first and second wedge elements 855, 860 together. When the first and second
wedge elements 855, 860 are coupled together and the second wedge element 860 has been
driven down, the tabs 875 extend over and onto ledges 877 inside the lip 710, thereby helping to
secure the modular adapter 715 in place. Other constructions include different fasteners 795 than
that illustrated that may be inserted partially or entirely through the aperture 800 to secure the
modular adapter 715 to the dipper lip 710.
[0049]               With reference to FIGS. 15-17, in some constructions a collar 815 extends around a
portion of the central body 775 (or around a portion of a shroud 720). As illustrated in FIG. 16,
the collar 815 includes a projection 820 and a central opening 825. The projection 820 is fit over
an inner surface 830 of the dipper 705 (the inner surface 830 facing an inside of the dipper 705
that receives material) so that the collar 815 may abut with the lip 710. The first portion 765 of
the modular adapter 715 is inserted through the central opening 825 of the collar 815 when the
modular adapter 715 is inserted into the aperture 730. In some constructions, the cross-section of
the central opening 825 is generally similar in size and shape to the cross-section of the central
body 775. This provides the modular adapter 715 with a secure fit within the collar 815. In the
illustrated construction, and as illustrated in FIG. 17, an end 817 of the tooth point 740 is adjacent
to the collar 815 when the modular adapter 715 is coupled to the dipper 705, such that the collar
9699398_1 (GHMatters) P107340.AU

                                                                14
815 is tightly fitted between the tooth point 740 and the dipper lip 710. Other constructions
include various other shapes and sizes of collars 815 than that illustrated.
[0050]                      In some constructions, one or more of the modular adapters 215, 525, 625, 715
described herein are formed integrally as a single piece with their corresponding tooth points 285,
545, 640, 740, thereby forming single-piece wear structures (e.g., monolithic structures) that are
inserted into one of the apertures in the dipper lip. For example, and with reference to FIG. 17, in
some constructions the mating projection 780 does not mate with a tooth point 740. Rather, the
mating projection 780 and the tooth point 740 are integrally formed as one structure, extending
away from the central body 775.
[0051]                      Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to certain
preferred embodiments, variations and modifications exist within the scope and spirit of one or
more independent aspects of the invention as described.
[0052]                      In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the invention,
except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the
word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of
further features in various embodiments of the invention.
