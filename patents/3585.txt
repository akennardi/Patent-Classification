                                  OF A SURGICAL CASSETTE
 5 CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
   [1] The present application is a divisional of parent application 2014223631, the
   contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
   TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   [2] The present invention is generally related to methods, devices, and systems related
10 to apparatuses for controlling surgical fluid flows, particularly during treatment of an eye.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   [3] The optical elements of the eye include both a cornea (at the front of the eye) and a
   lens within the eye. The lens and cornea work together to focus light onto the retina at
   the back of the eye. The lens also changes in shape, adjusting the focus of the eye to
15 vary between viewing near objects and far objects. The lens is found just behind the
   pupil, and within a capsular bag. This capsular bag is a thin, relatively delicate structure
   which separates the eye into anterior and posterior chambers.
   [4] With age, clouding of the lens or cataracts are fairly common. Cataracts may form in
   the hard central nucleus of the lens, in the softer peripheral cortical portion of the lens,
20 or at the back of the lens near the capsular bag.
   [5] Cataracts can be treated by the replacement of the cloudy lens with an artificial lens.
   Phacoemulsification systems often use ultrasound energy to fragment the lens and
   aspirate the lens material from within the capsular bag. This may allow the capsular bag
   to be used for positioning of the artificial lens, and maintains the separation between the
25 anterior portion of the eye and the vitreous humour in the posterior chamber of the eye.
   [6] During cataract surgery and other therapies of the eye, accurate control over the
   volume of fluid within the eye is highly beneficial. For example, while ultrasound energy
                                                   1

    breaks up the lens and allows it to be drawn into a treatment probe with an aspiration
   flow, a corresponding irrigation flow may be introduced into the eye so that the total
   volume of fluid in the eye does not change excessively. If the total volume of fluid in the
   eye is allowed to get too low at any time during the procedure, the eye may collapse
 5  and cause significant tissue damage. Similarly, excessive pressure within the eye may
   strain and injure tissues of the eye.
    [7] While a variety of specific fluid transport mechanisms have been used in
    phacoemulsification and other treatment systems for the eyes, aspiration flow systems
   can generally be classified in two categories: 1) volumetric-based aspiration flow
10 systems using positive displacement pumps; and 2) vacuum-based aspiration systems
    using a vacuum source, typically applied to the aspiration flow through an air-liquid
    interface. These two categories of aspiration flow systems each have unique
   characteristics that render one more suitable for some procedures than the other, and
   vice versa.
15 [8] Among positive displacement aspiration systems, peristaltic pumps (which use
    rotating rollers that press against a flexible tubing to induce flow) are commonly
   employed. Such pumps provide accurate control over the flow volume. The pressure of
   the flow, however, is less accurately controlled and the variations in vacuum may result
   in the feel or traction of the handpiece varying during a procedure. Peristaltic and other
20 displacement pump systems may also be somewhat slow.
   [9] Vacuum-based aspiration systems provide accurate control over the fluid pressure
   within the eye, particularly when combined with gravity-fed irrigation systems. While
   vacuum-based systems can result in excessive fluid flows in some circumstances, they
   provide advantages, for example, when removing a relatively large quantity of the
25 viscous vitreous humour from the posterior chamber of the eye. However, Venturi
   pumps and other vacuum-based aspiration flow systems are subject to pressure surges
   during occlusion of the treatment probe, and such pressure surges may decrease the
   surgeon's control over the eye treatment procedure.
   [10] Different tissues may be aspirated from the anterior chamber of the eye with the
30 two different types of aspiration flow. For example, vacuum-induced aspiration flow may
   quickly aspirate tissues at a significant distance from a delicate structure of the eye
                                                 2

    (such as the capsular bag), while tissues that are closer to the capsular bag are
   aspirated more methodically using displacement-induced flows.
    [11] Conventionally, fluid aspiration systems include a console and a fluidic cassette
    mounted on the console. The fluidic cassette is typically changed for each patient and
 5 cooperates with the console to provide fluid aspiration. Generally, a single type of
   cassette is used by a particular console, regardless of whether the procedure will
    require positive displacement aspiration, vacuum-based aspiration, or both. U.S. Patent
   8,070,712; U.S. Published Application 2008011431; and U.S. Published Application
   20080114291 provide examples of cassettes currently used in the marketplace, the
10 contents of each are herewith incorporated by reference in their entirety as if set forth
    herein.
   [12] Such a cassette is typically physically mated to the afore-discussed console. In
   providing the physical association between the cassette and the console, at least the
   aspiration/pumping aspects discussed above must be properly aligned as between the
15 cassette and the console, at least in order to provide proper functionality to the fluid
   aspiration   systems. As such,          misalignment  may   lead to   system malfunction,
   inoperability, or poor performance. However, currently available systems that provide for
   the alignment of placement and attitude of the cassette onto the console suffer from a
   variety of issues, including jamming, breakage, and inability to assess a sound
20 alignment and cassette attitude, among others.
   [13] In light of the above, it would be advantageous to provide improved devices,
   systems, and methods for eye surgery.

   suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any
25 jurisdiction or that this prior art could reasonably be expected to be combined with other
   pieces of prior art by a skilled person in the art.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[51]     Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, examples of
which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in
conjunction with the embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the
invention to those embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives,
modifications, and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the
invention as defined by the appended claims.
[52]     Referring to FIG. 1, a system 10 for treating an eye E of a patient P generally includes an
eye treatment probe handpiece 12 coupled to a console 14 by a cassette 100 mounted on the
console. Handpiece 12 may include a handle for manually manipulating and supporting an
insertable probe tip. The probe tip has a distal end which is insertable into the eye, with one or
                                                   8

more lumens in the probe tip allowing irrigation fluid to flow from the console 14 and/or cassette
100 into the eye. Aspiration fluid may also be withdrawn through a lumen of the probe tip, with
the console 14 and cassette 100 generally including a vacuum aspiration source, a positive
displacement aspiration pump, or both to help withdraw and control a flow of surgical fluids into
and out of eye E. As the surgical fluids may include biological materials that should not be
transferred between patients, cassette 100 will often comprise a disposable (or alternatively,
sterilizable) structure, with the surgical fluids being transmitted through flexible conduits 18 of
the cassette that avoid direct contact in between those fluids and the components of console 14.
[53]     When a distal end of the probe tip of handpiece 12 is inserted into an eye E, for example,
for removal of a lens of a patient with cataracts, an electrical conductor and/or pneumatic line
(not shown) may supply energy from console 14 to an ultrasound transmitter of the handpiece, a
cutter mechanism, or the like. Alternatively, the handpiece 12 may be configured as an
irrigation/aspiration (1/A) or vitrectomy handpiece. Also, the ultrasonic transmitter may be
replaced by other means for emulsifying a lens, such as a high energy laser beam. The
ultrasound energy from handpiece 12 helps to fragment the tissue of the lens, which can then be
drawn into a port of the tip by aspiration flow. So as to balance the volume of material removed
by the aspiration flow, an irrigation flow through handpiece 12 (or a separate probe structure)
may also be provided, with both the aspiration and irrigations flows being controlled by console
 14.
[54]     So as to avoid cross-contamination between patients without incurring excessive
expenditures for each procedure, cassette 100 and its flexible conduit 18 may be disposable.
Alternatively, the flexible conduit or tubing may be disposable, with the cassette body and/or
other structures of the cassette being sterilizable. Regardless, the disposable components of the
                                                    9

cassette are typically configured for use with a single patient, and may not be suitable for
sterilization. The cassette will interface with reusable (and often quite expensive) components of
console 14, which may include one or more peristaltic pump rollers, a Venturi or other vacuum
source, a controller 40, and the like.
[55]     Controller 40 may include an embedded microcontroller and/or many of the components
common to a personal computer, such as a processor, data bus, a memory, input and/or output
devices (including a touch screen user interface 42), and the like. Controller 40 will often
include both hardware and software, with the software typically comprising machine readable
code or programming instructions for implementing one, some, or all of the methods described
herein. The code may be embodied by a tangible media such as a memory, a magnetic recording
media, an optical recording media, or the like. Controller 40 may have (or be coupled to) a
recording media reader, or the code may be transmitted to controller 40 by a network connection
such as an internet, an intranet, an Ethernet, a wireless network, or the like. Along with
programming code, controller 40 may include stored data for implementing the methods
described herein, and may generate and/or store data that records perimeters with corresponding
to the treatment of one or more patients. Many components of console 14 may be found in or
modified from known commercial phacoemulsification systems from Abbott Medical Optics Inc.
of Santa Ana, California; Alcon Manufacturing, Ltd. of Ft. Worth, Texas; Bausch and Lomb of
Rochester, New York; and other suppliers.
[56]     FIG. 2 illustrates a surgical cassette of the present invention, including components of
surgical cassette 100. Surgical cassette 100 is an assembly of fluid pathways and connected
tubing configured to manage one or more of the following: fluid inflow, fluid outflow, fluid
vacuum level, and fluid pressure in a patient's eye E when coupled with console 14. Surgical
                                                     10

cassette 100 may include grip loop handle 101, which provides a sterile means for holding and
positioning surgical cassette 100 under finger grip control. In an embodiment, grip loop handle
 101 is designed for an index finger to pass completely thru the loop of the handle. The grip loop
handle 101 may also be designed for the pad of the thumb to rest on outer top surface of grip
loop handle 101.
[57]     In an embodiment, surgical cassette 100 may include a thumb shield 102. As illustrated
in FIG. 2, thumb shield 102 may have a raised border above grip loop handle 101, which is
configured and dimensioned to surround a sterile gloved thumb to reduce potential for contact
with non-sterile surfaces during insertion of surgical cassette 100 into console. Thumb shield
102 may have one or more surface elements. For example, thumb shield 102 may have one or
more generally horizontally extending raised surfaces to constrain the tip of the thumb from
extending beyond the upper shielded coverage of the frame of surgical cassette 100. Thumb
shield 102 may have in the alternative or in addition to the one or more horizontally extending
raised surface, one or more generally vertically extending raised surfaces to constrain the side of
the thumb from slipping sideways (left or right) beyond the coverage of the thumb shield 102
constraining surface(s).
[58]     In an embodiment, surgical cassette 100 may include drain bag port 103. As illustrated in
FIG. 2, drain bag port 103 is an axially extending cylindrical port with a central opening to
enable the transfer of fluid from the inside of the surgical cassette 100 manifold to an externally
attached collection reservoir such as drain bag or collection vessel 140 (see FIG. 9a and 9b). In
an embodiment as illustrated in FIG. 3, drain bag port 103 may have one or more recessed
notches 103a in the end face of drain bag port 103 to provide one or more gaps for fluid to flow
into an externally attached bag. Such a feature helps to minimize the potential for the bag
                                                  11

surface to obstruct fluid outflow through the port. Inside surface feature 103b may be configured
to accept a male slip luer fitting to support the connection to external tubing sets.
[59]     As illustrated in FIG. 2, surgical cassette 100 may include a drain bag hook 104. Drain
bag hook 104 is a mechanical feature extending outward from the surface of surgical cassette
104 and is configured to interface with a corresponding slot feature in the drain bag 140 (see
FIG. 9a) to support the weight of the drain bag as it collects fluid.
[60]     Surgical cassette 100 may also include one or more clamping domes 106. As illustrated
in FIG. 2, clamping domes 106 may be a raised pattern of spherical domed surfaces with a single
high-point to provide low friction wiping contact surfaces during loading and concentrate axial
clamping forces in specific zones after loading surgical cassette 100 with console 14. It is also
envisioned that the one or more clamping domes 106 may be of any shape or size suitable for its
function or desired aesthetic look and feel.
[61]     In an embodiment, surgical cassette 100 may include peristaltic pump tube 107. FIG. 4a
shows the backside of surgical cassette and peristaltic pump tube 107. Peristaltic pump tube 107
may be an elastomeric length of tubing that is configured to generate positive displacement of
fluid flow in the direction of pump roller (not shown) when a portion of the tubing is compressed
between the peristaltic pump rollers of console 14 and the backing plate pump profile 108 of the
surgical cassette 100. It is also envisioned that any type of flow-based pump and corresponding
components may be used with surgical cassette 100. In an embodiment, backing plate pump
profile 108 may be comprised of contoured surfaces formed on the inside of cassette frame/front
plate 100a to provide a compressing tubing while creating peristaltic pumping flow.
                                                    12

[62]    As illustrated in FIG. 4a, 4b, and 4c, surgical cassette 100 may have axial mating plane
surfaces 105. Axial mating plane surfaces 105 are outer border faces of cassette frame/front
plate 100a that form a surface mating with console 14 within cassette receiver 123 after loading.
[63]    In an embodiment, surgical cassette 100 may also include one or more peristaltic tube
form retainers 109. (See FIGs. 4a, 4b, 4c, 5, 6, and 18) Clamping surfaces formed between the
cassette frame/front plate 100a and backing plate 100b are configured to axially retain the tubing
to maintain consistency of tubing stretch and provide centering of tubing within peristaltic pump
profile 108. Form retainers 109 may comprise mating sections 109a of cassette frame front plate
 100a. Form retainers 109 are configured and dimensioned to shape peristaltic pump tube 107
and in the embodiment illustrated in the figures, to guide peristaltic pump tube 107 into an
approximately 180 degree turn on each end of tube 107.
[64]    In an embodiment as illustrated in FIGs. 4a, 4b, and 4c, backing plate 100b may be
recessed within cassette frame/front plate 100a such that when surgical cassette 100 is inserted
into console 14, backing plate 100b does not touch the cassette receiver 123. In the alternative,
backing plate 100b may be configured and dimensioned to touch cassette receiver 123.
[65]     Referring to FIGs. 5a, 5b, 6, 7, and 18, surgical cassette 100 may also include one or
more pump tube interface ports 110. Pump tube interface ports 110 are inlet and outlet transition
ports to transition fluid flow from internal molded manifold fluid flow channels 111 to peristaltic
pump tube 107. In an embodiment, surgical cassette 100 may also include one or more manifold
fluid flow channels 111. Manifold fluid flow channels 111 are fluid flow pathways formed as
raised surfaces allowing fluid to flow in internal channels between the raised surfaces and outer
perimeter sealing border of gasket 120 to retain fluid within the manifold fluid flow channels 111
under positive pressure and vacuum conditions. Manifold fluid flow channels 111 may comprise
                                                   13

irrigation flow channel 111a, which is a pathway with an inlet tubing port from balance salt
solution (BSS) irrigation bottle metered by valves to one or more, preferably two outlet ports:
(1) irrigation tubing outlet port 118 connected to an external surgical handpiece 12 flowing fluid
to the eye, which may be metered or controlled by irrigation valve 113; and (2) venting line 111 b
providing BSS irrigation fluid into an aspiration line of flexible conduits 18 which may be
metered or controlled by vent valve 114.
[66]     Manifold fluid flow channels 111 may also have aspiration flow channel 11 lb.
Aspiration flow channel 111 b may include a pressure/vacuum sensor element 111 c, a pumping
outlet port 111 d, and two inlet ports comprising aspiration fluid inflow from tubing line
connected to external surgical handpiece 12 and venting fluid inflow from BSS irrigation bottle,
which may be metered by vent valve 114. Manifold fluid flow channels 111 may also comprise
vent flow channel 11 Ic. Vent flow channel 111 c is a pathway configured to provide BSS
irrigation fluid into the aspiration line, which may be metered by vent valve 114 to reduce
vacuum level in the aspiration line following handpiece 12 tip obstruction or occlusion.
Manifold fluid flow channels 111 may also have manifold channel sealing surfaces 112, which
comprise the top surface or portion thereof of the channels 111.
[67]     Referring to FIGs. 4a, 4b, 4c, 5, and 6, surgical cassette 100 may include irrigation valve
113, which in an embodiment may have a dome-like shape. Irrigation valve 113 may be an
elastomeric deformable surface which allows irrigation flow from a BSS bottle to external
surgical handpiece 12 when uncompressed and shuts off flow when deformed inwards towards
manifold fluid flow channels 111. Surgical cassette 100 may also include vent valve 114, which
in an embodiment may have a dome-like shape. Vent valve 114 may be an elastomeric
deformable surface which allows irrigation flow from the BSS bottle through the aspiration line
                                                   14

that coupled with the external surgical handpiece 12 resulting in vacuum level reduction when
uncompressed and shuts off flow when deformed inwards towards manifold fluid flow channels
 111. The level of fluid flow may be controlled based upon the level of compression of valves
(113 and 114) - from full flow to intermediate flow to no flow.
[68]     In an embodiment illustrated in FIGs. 5a, 5b, and 6, surgical cassette 100 may have
irrigation valve control surface 115. Irrigation valve control surface 115 may be a raised sealing
surface in manifold fluid flow channels 111 that provides irrigation fluid flow reduction or
shutoff from the BSS irrigation bottle to an irrigation inlet fitting of surgical handpiece 12 when
irrigation valve control dome is compressed or activated. Surgical handpiece 100 may also
include vent valve control surface 116. Vent valve control surface 116 may be a raised sealing
surface in manifold fluid flow channels 111 that provides shutoff of venting of irrigation fluid
flow from the BSS irrigation bottle to an aspiration fitting of surgical handpiece 12 when vent
valve 114 is compressed or activated.
[69]     In an embodiment illustrated in FIG. 8, surgical cassette 100 may include irrigation inlet
tubing port 117, irrigation outlet tubing port 118, and aspiration outlet tubing port 119. Irrigation
inlet tubing port 117 may be a connection port for tubing extending to the BSS irrigation bottle
to deliver irrigation fluid to manifold fluid flow channels 111. Irrigation outlet tubing port 118
may be a connection port for tubing extending to the surgical handpiecel2 irrigation fitting to
deliver irrigation fluid from manifold fluid flow channels 111 to patient's eye E. Aspiration
outlet tubing port 119 may be a connection port for tubing extending to the surgical handpiece 12
aspiration fitting for removing fluid from a patient's eye E by means of a pump, such as a flow
based pump, preferably a peristaltic pump comprising the peristaltic pump tube 107. In an
embodiment, surgical cassette 100 may also include or in the alternative of drain bag port 103,
                                                   15

optional drain port 103c, which may be connected to an external tubing line or reservoir. In an
embodiment, drain port 103c may be closed by a plug or similar device known in the art.
 [70]   Surgical cassette 100 may include gasket 120 as illustrated in FIGs. 10a and 1Ob, which
may be an integrated elastomeric fluid channel sealing gasket. Gasket 120 may include a
vacuum/pressure sensor diaphragm 120a, irrigation valve control dome 113, and vent valve
control dome 113. Gasket 120 may also include fluid channel sealing surfaces 120b.
Vacuum/pressure sensor diaphragm 120a may be a sealed flexible annular membrane with a
central magnetic coupling disk which deforms: (1) proportionally outwards under fluid pressure
conditions compressing a magnetically-coupled force displacement transducer of console 14
allowing for non-fluid contact measurement of fluid pressure level inside the aspiration fluid
pathways of surgical cassette 100; and (2) proportionally inwards under fluid vacuum conditions
extending the magnetically-coupled force displacement transducer of console 14 allowing for
non-fluid contact measurement of fluid vacuum level inside the aspiration fluid pathways of
surgical cassette 100. In an embodiment, gasket 120 may have one or more fluid channel sealing
surfaces 120d, which may be a raised lip portion of the gasket 120. In the embodiment shown in
FIG. 10a, two such sealing surfaces 120b are illustrated.
[71]    In an embodiment, gasket 120 may be molded onto the backing plate 100b by co-molding
or any other process known in the art. Co-molding the gasket 120 and backing plate 100b result
in a combination of elastomeric features of gasket 120 and rigid features of backing plate 100b.
[72]    In an embodiment, surgical cassette 100 may also include pressure/vacuum sensor
concentric alignment ring 121 as illustrated in FIG. 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5a. Alignment ring 121 may
include a pattern of a radially oriented rib features defining a circular are of a specific diameter
and location to provide for concentric alignment between the center of the magnetically-coupled
                                                   16

force displacement transducer 131 of console 14 and the center of vacuum/pressure diaphragm
120a of surgical cassette 100. The pattern may comprise one or more radially oriented rib
features, preferably a minimum of three radially oriented rib features.
[73]     In FIGs: 11, 11 a, 12 and 13, fluidics module 122 is illustrated according to an
embodiment of the present invention. Fluidics module 122 comprises an assembly of
components mounted in console 14 for interfacing with surgical cassette 100. Fluidics module
122 may have one or more of the components described herein. Fluidics module 122 may have
cassette receiver 123, cassette pre-load detection pin 124, and pre-load detection switch 125
(shown in FIG. 16a). Cassette receiver 123 may be a section of fluidics module 122 defining an
engagement area for loading and aligning surgical cassette 100 in its intended position relative to
various components of fluidics module 122. Cassette receiver 123 may have tapered lead-in pre
alignment surfaces 123a, which may include outside vertical and horizontal border surfaces of
cassette receiver 123 that may be tapered towards the center of the opening of cassette receiver
 123 to guide surgical cassette 100 into a substantially centered position during off-angle
insertion. Cassette receiver 123 may also have axial interface surface 123b, which may include
planar engagement surfaces where cassette frame/front plate 100a bottoms out when fully
constrained by rotary clamps 126, 127.
[74]     Cassette pre-load detection pin 124 may be a spring-loaded pin displaced rearwards when
surgical cassette 100 is initially inserted with an end or side surface triggering a switch and
initiating closure of rotary clamps 126, 127. Pre-load detection switch 125 may be a switch
component that changes electrical output state when cassette pre-load detection pin 124 has been
displaced to a specific axial position indicating surgical cassette 100 is in an appropriate position
for loading engagement by rotary clamps 126, 127 (see FIGs. 15a and 15b). In an optional
                                                   17

embodiment, as shown in FIG. 16b, a second detection switch 142 may be located next to or
behind detection switch 125 to monitor the position of pre-load detection pin 124 to verify that
surgical cassette 100 reaches its intended interface position at the completion of the cassette
clamping mechanism closure.
 [75]    Left rotary clamp 126 may be a rotating clamping component configured with specific
surfaces to clamp surgical cassette 100 when rotated in a counter-clockwise direction as viewed
from the top T and specific ejection surfaces to disengage surgical cassette 100 when rotated in
the opposite direction. Right rotary clamp 127 may be a rotating clamping component
configured with specific surfaces to clamp surgical cassette 100 when rotated in a clockwise
direction as viewed from top T and specific ejection surfaces to disengage surgical cassette 100
when rotated in the opposite direction.
[76]     In an embodiment, fluidics module 122 may have a left clamping motor actuator 128 and
a right clamping motor actuator 129. Left clamping motor actuator 128 may be a reversible
rotary actuator powered by electricity, pneumatics, hydraulics, or any other means know in the
art, that controls the rotational position of the left rotary clamp 126 to alternately load and eject
surgical cassette 100. Right clamping motor actuator 129 may be a reversible rotary actuator
powered by electricity, pneumatics, hydraulics, or any other means know in the art, that controls
the rotational position of the right rotary clamp 127 to alternately load and eject surgical cassette
100. The actuation of the motor actuators 128 and 129 may be simultaneously or individually
controlled.
[77]     In an embodiment, fluidics module 122 may have a pump roller assembly 130. Pump
roller assembly may have a configuration of multiple roller elements in a circular or substantially
                                                    18

circular pattern which produce peristaltic flow-based fluid transport when rotated against
compressed fluid-filled peristaltic pump tube 107.
[78]     In an embodiment, fluidics module 122 may have a force displacement transducer 131.
Force displacement transducer 131 may operate by means of a magnetic coupling, such that fluid
vacuum inside manifold fluid flow channels 111 causes deformation inwards of vacuum/pressure
sensor diaphragm 120a in surgical cassette 100, which axially extends force displacement
transducer 131 resulting in a change of an electrical output signal in proportion to a vacuum
level. Positive fluid pressure in manifold fluid flow channels 111 results in an outward
extension of vacuum/pressure sensor diaphragm 120a and compression of the force displacement
transducer 131.
[79]     In an embodiment, fluidics module 122 may have irrigation valve plunger 132 and vent
valve plunger 133. Irrigation valve plunger 132 may have an axial extension of the plunger that
compresses irrigation valve 113 of surgical cassette 100 resulting in a decrease or shutoff of
irrigation flow to external irrigation tubing line of flexible conduit 18. Irrigation valve plunger
132 may also operate by a spring-loaded retraction of the plunger to allow varying levels of
irrigation flow. Vent valve plunger 133 may have an axial extension of the plunger that
compresses vent valve 114 of surgical cassette 100 resulting in a decrease or shutoff of irrigation
venting flow to external aspiration tubing line of flexible conduit 18. Vent valve plunger 133
may also operate by a spring-loaded retraction of the plunger to allow irrigation pressure fluid
flow to vent vacuum level in aspiration tubing line of flexible conduit 18.
[80]     In an embodiment, fluidics module 122 may have one or more of the following
components: peristaltic drive motor actuator 134, peristaltic pump motor drive pulley 135,
peristaltic drive belt 136, peristaltic roller driven pulley 137, and pump roller guide bearings 138.
                                                     19

Peristaltic drive motor actuator 134 may be a reversible rotary actuator powered by electricity,
pneumatics, hydraulics, or any other means known in the art that controls the rotational position
of the peristaltic pump roller assembly 130. Peristaltic pump motor drive pulley 135 may have a
pulley wheel connected to the rotary drive shaft of peristaltic drive motor actuator 134 to provide
a mating interface for peristaltic drive belt 136 when peristaltic drive motor actuator 134 is
oriented on an offset parallel axis to peristaltic pump roller assembly 130 for reducing overall
height of fluidics module 122. Peristaltic roller driven pulley 137 may have a pulley wheel
connected to rotary shaft peristaltic pump roller assembly 130. Peristaltic drive belt 136 may be
a belt connecting peristaltic pump motor drive pulley 135 to peristaltic roller driven pulley 137 to
transfer rotation of the pump drive motor shaft to the peristaltic pump roller assembly 130.
[81]     Pump roller guide bearings 138 may have at least one low friction bearing placed in
concentric alignment with peristaltic pump roller assembly 130 to guide shaft rotation of
peristaltic pump roller assembly 130. Pump roller guide bearings 138 may compensate for off
axis forces from compression of peristaltic pump tube 107 by peristaltic pump roller assembly
130 and peristaltic drive belt 136 tension between pulleys 135 and 137.
[82]     In an embodiment, fluidics module 122 may have rotary pump roller position encoder
139. Rotary pump roller position encoder may have an electronic output signal indicating rotary
position of peristaltic pump roller assembly 130, which may be used to derive and confirm
intended rotational speed during peristaltic pumping. Rotary pump roller position encoder 139
may also be used to provide controlled rotary position changes for the following purposes:
increase or decrease pressure level in fluid line by a target amount by transferring a pre
determined volume of fluid into or out of the fluid line faster than closed-loop pressure
monitoring allows based on an algorithm assuming a known overall system volume; and/or
                                                   20

increase or decrease vacuum level in fluid line by a target amount by transferring a pre
determined volume of fluid into or out of fluid line faster than closed-loop vacuum monitoring
allows based on an algorithm assuming a known overall system volume.
[83]     Operation of Surgical Cassette and Console
[84]     The following describes exemplary embodiments of operating surgical cassette 100 and
console 14 according to the present invention. In an embodiment, a surgical technician grasps
surgical cassette 100 by placing an index finger through the opening of grip loop handle 101 and
gripping handle 101 with thumb pressure on thumb shield 102 (outer top surface of handle). The
surgical technician's hand can remain sterile while tubing lines are handed off to supporting non
sterile staff to make connections to the non-sterile BSS irrigation bottle. With the surgical
technician's thumb being shielded from inadvertent contact with non-sterile outer surfaces of
console 14 by means of thumb shield 102, surgical cassette 100 may be directly inserted into
cassette receiver 123 of fluidics module 122 with centering guidance provided by tapered outer
surfaces 123 a. The direct axial insertion of surgical cassette 100 into cassette receiver 123 of
fluidics module 122 results in axial mating plane surfaces 105 contacting ejection surfaces 126b
and 127b of left and right rotary clamps 126,127. (See FIGs. 14a, 14b, 15a, and 15b).
[85]     Approximately synchronized with contacting ejection surfaces 126b and 127b of rotary
clamps 126, 127, cassette pre-load detection pin 124 is compressed triggering a switch signal to
be sent from cassette pre-load detection switch 125 to the control means of console 14.
Triggering of cassette pre-load detection switch 125, triggers rotation of clamping motor
actuators 128, 129 and contact between loading clamp surfaces 126a, 127a of rotary clamps 126,
127 and clamping domes 106 on cassette frame/front plate 100a. Clamping motor actuators 128,
                                                 21

129 will continue to rotate until axial mating plane surfaces 105 of cassette frame/front plate
 100a are compressed filly flat and parallel to mounting reference surfaces of fluidic module 122.
[86]     Surgical cassette 100 is guided into horizontal and vertical preferred alignment by
concentric alignment of ribs 121 of pressure/vacuum sensor diaphragm 120a of surgical cassette
100 with outer ring surface 131a (see FIG. 1 la) of force displacement transducer 131. See FIG.
11 a. After tubing connections are made to external accessories (e.g., handpiecc 12 with attached
phaco needle tip and irrigation sleeve (not shown)), surgical staff initiates a fluid priming of
tubing lines and internal cassette fluid pathways (i.e. manifold fluid flow channels 111) with
irrigation fluid delivered from an irrigation source (e.g. BSS bottle)
[87]     Console 14 may verify one or more of the following: proper tubing connections, fluid
line scaling, and fluid control operation during the priming procedure by generating flow through
aspiration pathways of manifold fluid flow channels 111 by rotating peristaltic pump roller
assembly 130 against outer surface of peristaltic pump tube 107 in compression against
peristaltic pump profile 108 of backing plate 100b.
[88]     Desired and/or appropriate pressure and vacuum levels are verified by means of the
magnetically-coupled pressure/vacuum sensor diaphragm 120 pulling outwards on force
displacement transducer 131 in proportion to an actual vacuum level and pushing inwards in
proportion to actual pressure levels.
[89]     Fluid flow may be metered on and off or varied by means of extending and retracting
irrigation and vent valve plungers 132, 133, which shutoff or vary fluid flow when extended to
compress sealing surfaces of irrigation valve 113 and vent valve 114 against irrigation and vent
valve surfaces 115, 116.
                                                  22

 [90]    A surgical user may control the outflow rate of fluid from externally attached tubing
accessories (e.g., handpiece 12 with attached phaco tip and irrigation sleeve (not shown)) by
selecting desired aspiration pump flow rate which is converted by one or more control algorithms
of console 14 into speed of rotation of peristaltic pump roller assembly 130.
 [91]    According to an embodiment, to enable reduced overall height of fluidics module 122,
peristaltic drive motor actuator 134 may be configured as a parallel axis drive mechanism such
as the belt drive and pulley mechanism described herein. In another embodiment, peristaltic
drive motor actuator 134 may be oriented such that the drive shaft is perpendicular to the
peristaltic pump roller assembly 130 using one or more gears to couple the peristaltic drive
motor actuator 134 with the peristaltic pump roller assembly 130. This in turn would also enable
a reduction of overall height of fluidics module 122.
[92]     Referring to FIGs. 16a, 16b, 17a, and 17b, in another embodiment, using a non-axial
drive connection between peristaltic drive motor actuator 134 and peristaltic pump roller
assembly 130, a rotary pump roller position encoder 139, which may be any type of indicator
known in the art, may be mounted onto the rotating shaft of peristaltic pump roller assembly 130
to detect slippage or asynchronous rotation of peristaltic drive motor actuator 134 with respect to
peristaltic pump roller assembly130. Since peristaltic pumping is generated in direct proportion
to peristaltic pump roller assembly 130 to rotational speed of peristaltic drive motor actuator 134
during slippage conditions, placement of rotary pump roller position encoder 139 onto peristaltic
pump roller assembly 130 provides increased accuracy and reliability of intended operation.
[93]     When the surgical procedure is completed, surgical staff initiate ejection of surgical
cassette 100 from fluidics module 122 by activating ejection switch 141 (see FIG. 11 a) which
signals the clamp motor actuators 128, 129 to reverse rotation and disengage axial mating plane
                                                  23

 surfaces 105 of surgical cassette 100 from axial interface surface 123b of fluidics module 122 by
 a controlled distance.
 [94]    In an embodiment, the final ejected position of surgical cassette 100 results in surgical
 cassette 100 still being retained on its outer border edges within the lead-in portion 123a (see
 FIG. 11 and 1 la) of cassette receiver 123 to prevent surgical cassette 100 having internal surgical
 waste fluid from falling onto the floor.
 [95]    In yet another embodiment, a potentiometer-based cassette attitude, alignment, and load
 complete detection "switch" may be provided. More particularly, this potentiometer-based
 switch allows for predisposition of the planar attitude and alignment of a cassette 100 presented
to the cassette receiver 123 of the fluidics module 122. In short, only a cassette 100 presented in
 an acceptable attitudinal angular range, and with the proper alignment, will allow the fluidics
module 122 to receive the cassette 100 and operate any of the cassette clamping or seizing
mechanisms discussed herein. Consequently, the cassette 100 may not be presented in a manner
that would cause the clamping mechanism to jam, or that would cause the cassette 100 to be
misaligned with the cassette receiver 123. In prior systems and methods, the planar orientation
and alignment of the cassette was not adequately accounted for, and consequently the cassette
could be improperly forced, or jammed, into place. In contrast, in the exemplary system and
method provided herein, the aforementioned mechanical potentiometer-based micro-switch is
provided, whereby improved reliability and refined control is available to prevent forcing,
jamming, misalignment, or other malfunction.
 [96]    FIG. 19 is a schematic illustration of an exemplary potentiometer 202 for use in the
instant embodiments. Those skilled in the art will appreciate, in light of the disclosure herein,
that the potentiometer 202 may be or include any means of providing a detector for variations in
                                                   24

electrical resistance, and that the variations in electrical resistance provided may be stepped, i.e.,
may have discrete available values, or may be continuous. Further, the detector may be of any
form suitable to provide variations in electrical resistance responsive to pressure thereupon, such
as the aforementioned potentiometer, a Wheatstone bridge, a resistive divider, or the like.
Additionally, the detector may be actuated by any known mechanism, including but not limited
to the linearly displaced shaft 204 discussed herein.
[97]     The exemplary potentiometer shown in FIG. 19 includes a spring loaded, self-guided
plunger shaft 204 and associated housing 206, which shaft 204 may pass through, or which shaft
204 may connect to a rod 208 that passes through, a mounting body 210. The axis of the shaft
204 may run parallel to the length of the housing 206, with the spring (not shown) internal to the
housing and proximate to a closed base thereof, wherein an end of the shaft 204 fully contained
within the housing 206 may rest upon the spring. The rod 208 may comprise a machined adaptor
that is pressed on, glued on, welded on, or threaded on to the shaft 204 of the potentiometer. If
provided, the rod 208 must be mounted reasonably accurately to the shaft 204, to thus avoid
misrepresentation of the attitude or alignment of the cassette 100 as discussed further below.
Additionally, the spring loaded nature of the potentiometer shaft 204 and rod 208 (if so
equipped) provides a controlled resistance to an operator inserting the cassette 100 progressively
through the plane at the mouth of the cassette receiver 123, thereby helping to limit erratic
insertion attempts.
[98]     As in a typical linear potentiometer, when the shaft 204 is depressed, a modification to
the resistance provided by the potentiometer 202 is effected. Accordingly, the linear position of
the axial shaft 204 dictates a particular resistance of the potentiometer. Thereby, the resistance
of the illustrative potentiometer 202 is also indicative of the position of that which is depressing
                                                    25

the shaft 204 (or rod 208)-which, in this illustration, may be either the cassette 100 or the
fluidics module 122 for receiving the cassette 100, depending upon whether the potentiometer
202 is physically associated with the fluidics module 122 or the cassette 100, respectively. That
is, a linear potentiometer 202 may be employed on the fluidics module 122 to indicate the
relative position of the cassette 100 being mated to the fluidics module 122, or may be mounted
on the cassette 100 to indicate the relative position of the fluidics module 122 with respect
thereto.
[99]     In order to allow for physical association of the potentiometer 202 with either the cassette
100 or the fluidics module 122, the potentiometer 202 may include the aforementioned mounting
body 210. The axial shaft 204 of the potentiometer 202 may extend through a hole in the
mounting body 210, or may mate with the rod 208 that then extends through the hole in the
mounting body 210. The rod 208 may effectively extend the axial shaft 204 of the potentiometer
202 to allow for detection of the extent of depression of the axial shaft 204 as dictated by
depression of the detector rod 208.
[100] Accordingly, in exemplary embodiments, depression of the detector rod 208 may be
indicative of an attempt to mate the cassette 100 to the fluidics module 122. More particularly,
depression of at least two detector rods 208 positioned about the cassette receiver 123 may be
indicative of an alignment or attitude of the cassette 100 as the attempt is made to mate the
cassette 100 to the fluidics module 122. In an exemplary embodiment, the mounting position
may preferably comprise, in an exemplary two-potentiometer embodiment, a substantially
diagonal mounting with respect to the plane provided by the mouth of the cassette receiver 123
of the fluidics module 122, and this diagonal mounting may be as far diagonal as is practicable.
                                                  26

[101]     Each potentiometer 202 in a two potentiometer embodiment may thus register a linear
amount traveled once in contact with a back face of the cassette 100, i.e., at the point of initial
insertion of the cassette 100 to the cassette receiver 123. The two potentiometers in conjunction
may thus also provide a differential in the dimensional amount traveled by each plunger shaft
204 relative to the other, thereby indicating the tilt, angle, or attitude on-plane or off-plane of the
cassette 100 from the plane at the mouth of the cassette receiver 123. This differential may be
assessed, for example, using a comparator included in controller 40 that receives and compares
an electrical resistance reading of each potentiometer. An angle off-plane of a sufficient amount
may prevent actuation of the clamping mechanism for the cassette 100, thereby preventing
jamming and thus requiring that an operator remove the cassette 100 and re-approach the cassette
 100 to the cassette receiver 123.
 [102]   FIGs. 20a and 20b are cross-sectional schematic illustrations of the rear and front views,
respectively, of an exemplary embodiment of the fluidics module 122 and cassette receiver 123,
 in which two potentiometers 202 are used to detect alignment and attitude of a cassette 100 as it
is pushed toward a fluidics module 122. In the illustrated embodiment, the potentiometers 202
reside on the fluidics module 122, although the potentiometers 202 may also reside on the
 cassette 100, as referenced above. Further, although in the illustrated embodiment two
potentiometers 202 are shown diagonally about the cassette receiver 123 of the fluidics module
 122, any number of potentiometers greater than two, and in any one of several configurations,
may be used to provide a more refined indication of alignment and attitude of the cassette 100.
 For example, four potentiometers may be used, one adjacent to each of the four "comers" about
the cassette receiver 123.
                                                   27

[103]   In the rear view illustration, the two potentiometers 202 may be mounted at two corners
about the cassette receiver 123 using the mounting bodies 210 discussed above. The mounting
bodies 210 may be mounted using, for example, a screw or bolt placed through a hole in the
mounting body 210 and screwed or bolted into the rear of the fluidics module 122. Upon
mounting, and as shown in the front view illustration, the respective detector rods 208 of each
potentiometer 202 extend to the front of the fluidics module 122, i.e., into the cassette receiver
123, through holes extending from the rear of the fluidics module 122 to the front of the fluidics
module 122.
[104]   Accordingly, a full traverse by each potentiometer shaft 204 (or a linear traverse to a
predetermined point) may not only be indicative of a proper planar attitude and correct alignment
of the cassette 100 to the mounting plane, but may further be indicative that the cassette 100 is
fully inserted, or loaded, into the cassette receiver 123. Thus, a full linear traverse (or a linear
traverse to a predetermined point) by both (or all, in embodiments having more than two)
potentiometer shafts 204 may serve as an additional "switch" indicating a full and complete
insertion of the cassette 100, thereby allowing for continued normal operation of any clamping
mechanism and of the union of fluidics module 122 and cassette 100.
[105]   The mounting of the potentiometers 202 to the fluidics module 122 may be greatly
simplified using the illustrated embodiments as compared to alignment sensors generally
provided in the prior art. This may be the case at least because adjustment of optical sensors,
reading of voltmeters, and set screw adjustment and lock down adjustment may be avoided.
[106]    Further, the use of the potentiometers 202, or like detectors of variations in resistance,
allows for the sensing of attitude and alignment, and variations therein, in real time. Thereby,
motors associated with any of the clamping mechanisms discussed throughout may calibrate
                                                   28

 and/or adjust dynamically. That is, motor activation and speed may be dynamically
 adjusted to actuate clamps and/or to actuate doors to receive the cassette 100, and/or to
 release the cassette 100, such as to account for the attitude or alignment of the cassette 100
 approaching cassette receiver 123. As used herein, actuation of clamps may include
 clamping and unclamping, and actuation of doors may include opening and closing.
Additionally, motor activation and speed, and/or pump actuation and speed, by fluidics
module 122 may adjust dynamically during operation, such as if the cassette 100 changes
position slightly due to being bumped, or the like.

including any references cited therein.
 [108]   Although the present invention has been described in terms of specific
embodiments, changes and modifications can be carried out without departing from the
scope of the invention which is intended to be limited only by the scope of the claims.
 [109]   The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived
from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as, an

information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general
knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates.
[110]    Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the context
requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" or
  comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group
of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or

   cassette; and
         two potentiometers mounted within an area defined by the cassette receiver,
   wherein the potentiometers are each suitable for depression by a respective one of the
   positioning surfaces, and wherein an extent of the depressions is indicative of at least
10 one of an alignment and an attitude of said cassette with respect to the cassette
   receiver.
         2. The phacoemulsification system of claim 1, wherein the suitability for
   depression is provided by a spring loaded plunger shaft.
         3. The phacoemulsification system of claim 1 or 2, wherein the console further
15 comprises a comparator configured to compare, based on an electrical resistance
   reading, an extent of the depression of one of the potentiometers with that of another of
   the potentiometers to assess the attitude of the cassette.
         4. The phacoemulsification system of claim 3, wherein said comparator is further
   configured to compare an extent of the depression of both of the two potentiometers to
20 assess a complete loading of the cassette into the cassette receiver.
         5. The phacoemulsification system of claim 3 or 4, wherein the console further
   comprises a clamping mechanism suitable for clamping the cassette into the cassette
   receiver based on an assessment by said comparator of a minimum threshold for at
   least one of the alignment and the attitude.
