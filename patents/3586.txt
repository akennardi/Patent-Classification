                               HANDLE ASSEMBLY FOR DRYWALL FINISHER BOX
BACKGROUND
[0001]              This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent
Application No. 61/940,736, filed February 17, 2014, the entire contents of which are
incorporated herein by reference. This disclosure also accompanies a divisional innovation patent
application from AU 2015217476, the contents of which are incorporated in its entirety by
reference.
[0002]              The present disclosure relates to handles for a container. In particular, the present
disclosure relates to finisher boxes and handles for finisher boxes.
[0003]              Mastic or other seaming compounds are typically applied over seams in drywall and
other building materials. These seaming compounds are viscous and dispensed from containers
such as flat finisher boxes, which are used to apply finish coats of joint compound over taped
drywall joints. Flat finisher boxes currently include handles that allow the operator to control the
orientation of the box during use and to extend his reach. Controlling the orientation is a matter
of allowing the box to pivot from the handle or locking the handle in place when the operator
applies a locking mechanism (i.e., a brake lever) at a distal end of the handle. Conventional
handles for finisher boxes come in a variety of lengths, generally from about 34" long to as long
as 72" or longer.
SUMMARY
[0004]              Disclosed is a handle assembly for a container for dispensing a seaming compound,
the container having a pivotally mounted pressure plate with a fastener extending from a top side
thereof, the handle assembly comprising: a connector plate having a bottom surface engageable
with the pressure plate, a top surface opposite the bottom surface, and an edge extending
between the bottom surface and the top surface; a notch defined in the edge of the connector
plate in which the fastener on the pressure plate is receivable for securing the connector plate to
the pressure plate; a first handle for gripping with a first hand of a user; and a second handle for

compound comprises a connector plate configured for coupling to the container, a first handle,
and a second handle, wherein each of the first handle and the second handle is coupled to the
connector plate.
[0009]              In another embodiment, a handle assembly for a container comprises a pressure plate
configured for coupling to the container, a first handle having a longitudinal axis extending at a
first angle to the pressure plate, and a second handle having a longitudinal axis extending
substantially orthogonal to the pressure plate, wherein each of the first handle and the second

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 [0021]             Before any embodiments of the disclosure are explained in detail, it is to be
understood that the disclosure is not limited in its application to the details of construction and
the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the
following drawings. The disclosure is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of
being carried out in various ways.
 [0022]             FIGS. 1-4 illustrate a container or finisher box 10 including a handle assembly or
accessory 12 according to a first embodiment of the disclosure. For the purposes of this
application, the finisher box 10 is for drywall finishing. Drywall finishing is described herein as
an example for what the various embodiments of the handle assembly 12 may be used for.
 [0023]             The finisher box 10 also includes a body or housing 14 with a bottom wall and spaced
apart sides 16a, 16b, 16c, 16d. The bottom wall and the sides 16a-16d are adapted to receive
joint compound in a cavity they form. The bottom wall and sides 16a-16d may be formed as one
piece or coupled by any suitable fastener. A top wall or pressure plate 18 includes a first edge 20
and a spaced second edge 22 that may be parallel to the first edge 20. The pressure plate 18 is
retained within the finisher box 10 and is pivotable within the finisher box 10 relative to the sides
 16a-16d. In particular, the first edge 20 is slidable along the side 16d, which essentially forms a
front wall, while the second edge 22 remains positioned substantially adjacent the side 16c
(which essentially forms a back wall). In the illustrated embodiment, two fasteners 24 (i.e., set
screws) define a stop that prevents the pressure plate 18 from being completely displaced from
the finisher box 10. Other structures may retain the pressure plate 18 relative to the finisher box
 10. For example, in the embodiment of FIGS. 10-11, which will be described in greater detail
below, two rotatable latches 242 define the stop that prevents the pressure plate 218 from
separating from the finisher box 210. The finisher box 10 also includes an opening or aperture
(not shown) located between adjacent edges or surfaces of the bottom wall and the side 16d,
through which joint compound or a seaming compound can be extruded. As the pressure plate
 18 is pushed along the side 16d toward the bottom wall, seaming compound is forced out
                                                           4
9857160 1 (GHMatters) P103744.AU.1

through the aperture. In the illustrated embodiment, the aperture is substantially the same length
the bottom wall and side 16d, although the aperture in other embodiments may be any suitable
length. The side 16d or bottom wall also includes a blade finisher, which helps to evenly
distribute and smooth the seaming compound as it is pushed out of the aperture. The finisher
box 10 may also include wheels 26 to facilitate movement of the box 10 against the wall. The
finisher box 10 may also include a skid or skids 128 in place of one or both of the wheels 26, as
illustrated in FIGS. 5-8. Additionally, fasteners 30 (i.e., stubs or screws 30a and wingnuts 30b,
respectively) may be coupled to the pressure plate 18, and a tensioning mechanism 32 may be
included on the side 16d for adjusting the amount of seaming compound crown when filling the
cavity between the drywall panels.
[0024]              The handle assembly 12 according to the first embodiment of the disclosure is
coupled to the finisher box 10 and includes a first handle 34 (i.e., a knife handle) and a second
handle or a push post 36. In particular, the first handle 34 is coupled to the pressure plate 18.
The first handle 34,which is shaped and sized similarly to a conventional knife handle, is also
sized and shaped to fit comfortably in the operator's hand and gives the operator much improved
leverage and control when maneuvering the box 10 during use, as compared with conventional
handles. For example, the operator can use the box 10 with one hand by holding only the first
handle 34. Additionally, the first handle 34 may include a grip 38, which defines a first gripping
portion that emulates the size and shape of the grip used on standard drywall finisher knives,
thereby allowing the operator to operate the finisher box 10 much like he would a finisher knife.
Drywall finishers are very comfortable using a tool in this way.
[0025]              The push post 36 may be coupled to one or both of the pressure plate 18 and the first
handle 34. The first handle 34 and the push post 36 are positioned in close proximity to one
another. In the embodiment of FIGS. 1-4, the first handle 34 and the push post 36 are coupled to
one another on the pressure plate 18. As such, while the operator holds the first handle 34 with
one hand, he may use his other hand to manipulate the push post 36. Dual use of both the first
handle 34 and the push post 36 gives the operator substantial control over the path of the finisher
box 10. Pressure applied by hand to the push post 36 gives much more leverage as well, which
helps to push the seaming compound out of the finisher box 10 (and onto the wall to be finished).
The pressure is applied orthogonally to the pressure plate through the push post 36, therefore not
                                                       5
9857160 1 (GHMatters) P103744.AU.1

wasting a user's energy. In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1-4, the first handle 34 and the
push post 36 are bolted to the pressure plate 18 of the finisher box 10. However, the first handle
34 and the push post 36 may be secured in other ways to the pressure plate 18, as described
below and shown in FIGS. 5-8. The push post 36 and the first handle 34 may also be attached to
one another or to the pressure plate 18 in one of the ways as described above and below, or in
other ways not described within.
[0026]              In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1-4, the push post 36 is connected to the first
handle 34 by an attachment piece 40 (e.g., a piece of sheet metal). The attachment piece 40 is
stiff enough that the operator can control the box 10 very well and also apply enough pressure to
the pressure plate 18 to push the seaming compound out of the box 10 and onto the wall to be
finished. In other embodiments, the attachment piece 40 may be rather flexible. In those
embodiments, the first handle 34 is pivotable at the attachment piece 40 relative to the pressure
plate 18 to allow the operator to find a hand position that is most comfortable. The first handle
34 has a longitudinal axis defining an acute angle relative to the pressure plate 18.
[0027]              The push post 36 is bolted (or otherwise fastened) directly onto the pressure plate 18
or the attachment piece 40, and the push post 36 extends substantially orthogonally from the
pressure plate 18. A longitudinal axis of the push post 36 defines an angle relative to the
pressure plate 18 that is greater than the angle formed by the longitudinal axis of the first handle
34 to the pressure plate 18. Additionally, as illustrated, the push post 36 is positioned near the
first edge 20 of the pressure plate 18, which allows the operator to get maximum mechanical
advantage on the plate 18 and reduces the amount of pressure and effort to push seaming
compound out of the finisher box 10. The push post 36 is substantially rounded (i.e., knob
shaped) at a distal end to be comfortable in the palm of the operator's hand and to define a
second gripping portion.
[0028]              The entire handle assembly could also be made in one piece, such as by molding or
casting. FIGS. 5-8 illustrate a container or finisher box 110 including a handle assembly or
accessory 112 according to a second embodiment of the disclosure. Therefore, structure of the
second embodiment similar to the first embodiment will be identified with reference numerals of
the first embodiment plus "100," and only the differences will discussed herein.

 [0029]             FIGS. 5-8 show the pressure plate 118, the first handle 134, and the push post 136
molded as a one-piece assembly. The one-piece assembly is shaped substantially similar to the
design as shown in FIGS. 1-4. However, notably, the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 5-8 may
or may not include features on a top side of the pressure plate 118, such as the fasteners 30a, 30b.
 Similarly, the handle 134 may be formed as one piece with the pressure plate 118. In that
embodiment, the push post 136 may be formed as one piece with either the pressure plate 118 or
the first handle 134. The push post 136 and the first handle 134 may also be attached to one
another or to the pressure plate 118 in one of the ways as described above and below, or in other
ways not described within.
 [0030]             The second embodiment shows one wheel 126 and one skid 128, but may include a
second wheel 126 in place of the skid 128 or a second skid 128 in place of the wheel 126. The
skid 128 is configured to reduce the contact area between the wall and the finisher box 110 at an
end of the finisher box 110 opposite the aperture, therefore making maneuvering the finisher box
 10 along the wall easier. Preferably, the finisher box 110 will include wheels 126 on both sides,
or skids 128 on both sides. An axle 144, molded with the pressure plate 118 in the illustrated
embodiment, provides attachment points on its opposite ends for the wheels 126. The pressure
plate 118 is held in place through a rotatable latch 142 at a corner of the pressure plate 118 and
the finisher box 110.
 [0031]             In reference to both the first and the second embodiments, one or both of the first
handle 34, 134 and the push post 36, 136 may be used to move the box 10, 110 along a drywall
joint and push the seaming compound out of the finisher box 10, 110 and onto the wall. The
connection of the first handle 34, 134 and the push post 36, 136 to the pressure plate 18, 118
gives the operator increased leverage on the pressure plate 18, 118 as compared with the single
handles that are standard in the industry. Experienced drywall finishers will be very comfortable
manipulating the box 10, 110 with the first handle 34, 134 because holding only the first handle
34, 134 works and feels very much like using a drywall finishing knife. As such the handle
assembly for the finisher box 10, 110 of the present disclosure is ideal for all drywall projects
regardless of the operator's skills and experience finishing drywall.

[00321              FIGS. 10-11 illustrate a container or finisher box 210 according to a third
embodiment of the disclosure that includes a removable handle assembly or accessory 212. The
finisher box 210 and the handle assembly 212 of FIGS. 9-11 have similar structure to that of the
finisher box 10 and the handle assembly 12 of FIGS. 1-4. Therefore, structure of the third
embodiment similar to the first embodiment will be identified with reference numerals of the
first embodiment plus "200."
[0033]              The first handle 234 and the push post 236 are coupled to a connector plate 246,
forming the handle assembly 212 which is removably coupled to the pressure plate 218 of the
finisher box 210. The connector plate 246 includes a first edge 247a and a spaced second edge
247b that may be parallel to the first edge 247a. In the illustrated embodiment, the push post 236
is positioned near the first edge 247a of the connector plate 246, which allows the operator to get
maximum mechanical advantage on the pressure plate 218 through the connector plate 246 and
reduces the amount of pressure and effort to push seaming compound out of the finisher box 210.
The push post 236 is connected to the first handle 234 by the attachment piece 240 (e.g., a piece
of sheet metal). The attachment piece 240 may be coupled to the connector plate 246 by
fasteners or other coupling means.
[0034]              The connector plate 246 also includes two openings or notches 248. The two notches
248 are sized and shaped to receive fasteners 230 (i.e., studs 230a and wingnuts 230b,
respectively) provided on most commercially available flat finisher boxes. As a result, an
operator that already owns a conventional finisher box can attach the handle assembly 212 very
easily to his finisher box. This way, the handle assembly 212 may be attached as an auxiliary
accessory to be used when desired.
[0035]              To assemble the finisher box 210, the operator unscrews the wingnuts 230b away
from the pressure plate 218 and slides the connector plate 246 under the wingnuts 230b (i.e.,
between the pressure plate 218 and the wingnuts 230b). The notches 248 receive the studs 230a
disposed between the pressure plate 218 and the wingnuts 230b. The connector plate 246 is slid
under the wingnuts 230b until the notches 248 in the plate 246 fully seat against the studs 230a.
Once the connector plate 246 is appropriately positioned, the wingnuts 230b are tightened
                                                          8

against the connector plate 246 such that the handle assembly 212 is secured to the pressure plate
218 of the finisher box 210, which is ready for use.
[0036]              In reference to the first, second, and third embodiments, the handle 34, 134, 234 may
be formed as one piece with the pressure plate 18, 118, 218. Similarly, any combination of the
handle 34, 134, 234, the push post 36, 136, 236, the pressure plate 18, 118, 218, and/or the
connector plate 246 may be formed as one piece in other embodiments, and as similarly shown
in FIGS. 5-8. The push post 236 and the first handle 234 may also be attached to one another or
to the connector plate 246 in one of the ways as described above and below, or in other ways not
described within.
[0037]              The connector plate 246 may have any suitable shape and size, including that
illustrated in FIGS. 9-11. Though it is possible to operate a finisher box 10, 110, 210 by
grasping only the first handle 34, 134, 234, using both the first handle 34, 134, 234 and the push
post 36, 136, 236 is advantageous. For example, using two hands on the handle assembly 12,
112, 212, placed close to the box 10, 110, 210 gives exceptional control of the box 10, 110, 210
as it is moved along the drywall joint to be finished. Because of the leverage the push post 36,
136, 236 gives, applying pressure with both hands greatly reduces the overall effort required to
push seaming compound out of the finisher box 10, 110, 210 especially when compared to the
forces that must be generated to use any of the current finisher box handles.
[0038]              FIGS. 13-15 illustrate a container or finisher box 310 according to a fourth
embodiment of the disclosure that includes a removable handle assembly or accessory 312. The
finisher box 310 and the handle assembly 312 of FIGS. 12-15 have similar structure to that of the
finisher box 10 and the handle assembly 12 of FIGS. 1-4. Therefore, structure of the fourth
embodiment similar to the first embodiment will be identified with reference numerals of the
first embodiment plus "300." As the fourth embodiment is also similar to the third embodiment,
only the differences between the third and fourth embodiments will be discussed herein.
[0039]              FIGS. 12-15 illustrate the connector plate 346 including the first edge 347a, the
second edge 347b parallel to the first edge 347a, and an extension 350. The extension 350
includes a first end 352 and a second end 354. The first end 352 is coupled to the connector
plate 346, whereas the second end 354 couples to and extends into the first handle 334.

[0040]              FIGS. 12-15 illustrate a second handle 356 in place of the push post 36. Similar to
above, the second handle 356 and the first handle 334 may also be attached to one another or to
the connector plate 346 or the extension 350 in one of the ways as described above and below, or
in other ways not described within.
[0041]              The second handle 356 resembles a "seven" in shape and includes a vertical portion
358, a first angled portion 360, and a second angled portion 362 that defines the second gripping
portion. The vertical portion 358, similar to the push post 236 of the third embodiment, extends
substantially orthogonal to the connector plate 346. Therefore, when pressure is applied to the
second handle 356, force is exerted orthogonally to the connector plate 346. The first angled
portion 360 includes a longitudinal axis and extends from the vertical portion 358 partially in the
same direction that the vertical portion 358 extends (i.e., away from the connector plate 346), but
also toward the first handle 334. In FIGS. 12-14, the second angled portion 362 includes a
longitudinal axis and extends from the first angled portion 360 away from the first handle 334,
such that the longitudinal axis of the first angled portion 360 and the longitudinal axis of the
second angled portion 362 intersect to form an acute angle. The second angled portion 362 may
extend from the first angled portion 358 as illustrated in FIGS. 12-15, i.e., either slightly away
from the connecter plate 346, or it may be substantially parallel to the connector plate 346. The
second angled portion 362 may also include a knob 364 at an end of the second angled portion
362 away from the first angled portion 360.
[0042]               Some operators may prefer the second handle 356 extend toward the first handle 334,
as shown in FIG. 15, as opposed to the first orientation illustrated in FIGS. 12-14. Therefore, to
allow the operator's preference, the second handle 356 is capable of being reversed. FIG. 15
illustrates the second handle 356 rotated 180 degrees compared to the second handle 356 shown
in FIGS. 12-14. In the preferred embodiment, the second handle 356 includes four threaded
openings (not shown) which at least partially extend through the vertical portion 358 and may
further extend into the first angled portion 360. The connector plate 346 also includes four holes
(not shown) that substantially align with the openings of the second handle 356. Four threaded
fasteners (not shown) extend through the holes of the connector plate 346 and into the openings
of the second handle 356. The fasteners are tightened to secure the second handle 356 to the
connector plate 346. Therefore, when the fasteners are removed, the second handle 356 may be
                                                        10
9857160 1 (GHMatters) P103744.AU.1

reoriented and refastened to the connector plate 346 in a different operator's preferred
orientation. Although described as requiring four holes, four openings, and four fasteners, any
number of holes, openings, and fasteners sufficient to secure the second handle 356 to the
connector plate 346 may be used. Similarly, the second handle 356 may be rotated either less or
more than 180 degrees and secured by other methods not described within. Those other methods
may provide possibilities of orientating and securing the second handle 356 in a manner not
illustrated in FIGS. 12-15.
[0043]              In reference to the four embodiments, the length of the first handle 34, 134, 234, 334
can vary greatly depending on the operator's preference. The end of the first handle 34, 134,
234, 334 may include an attachment (not shown) configured to attach an extension pole. The
extension pole would allow an operator to use the finisher box 10, 110, 210, 310 in difficult to
reach places, such as ceilings. The embodiments illustrated show a first handle 34, 134, 234, 334
that has a relatively short length, however, embodiments not shown may include a first handle
design 34, 134, 234, 334 that has a much greater length allowing an operator to reach ceilings, or
the other difficult areas, without the use of the extension.
[0044]              Other handle shapes and connections other than those illustrated herein, which may
have various amounts of flexibility (and means of achieving that flexibility), as well as rigid
connections, may be used. For example, the first handle 34, 134, 234, 334 could be thinner and
longer, similar to handles used on many garden tools. The push post 36, 136, 236 could be
removable or have a variety of shapes, similar to that shown in FIGS. 12-15 and described
above. For example, the rounded flat distal end of the push post 36, 136, 236 shown herein
could be replaced by many other possible shapes.
[0045]              Various features and advantages of the disclosure are set forth in the following
claims. In the claims which follow and in the preceding description, except where the context
requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word "comprise" or
variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. To specify the
presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further features in
various embodiments of the handle assembly and finisher box. It is to be understood that, if any
