         Dodecanoic acid is mainly used for synthesis nylon 612, model resin, modified
   saturated polyester, powder coating, plasticizer, lubricating oil, metal precipitant etc.
10 The condensation generated by dodecanoic acid and six methylenediamine can make
   engineering plastic nylon 6-12; And the second ester generated by octyl alcohol,
   butanol and other alcohols can be used as polyvinyl chloride, cellulose nitrate, cellulose
   acetate plasticizer, and the second ester generated with octyl alcohol is used as
   advanced lubricating oil, or base oil for low temperature grease of jet engines and gas
15 turbines; It can also be used as a modified agent for saturated polyester, the precipitant
   of metal and the raw materials of spices and special polyurethane. Most of the existing
   synthesis methods have been used to get the butadiene tri-polythene, the cyclododecane
   by hydrogenation, and the oxidation of nitric acid through cyclododecanone. This
   method of production requires to use the nitric acid and hydrogen as raw materials for
20 the reaction, because the nitric acid has strong oxidation and corrosion resistance, and
   corrosion resistant ability of reaction equipment demand is higher, the equipment
   maintenance cost is higher, the hydrogen is used as a reactant, pressure resistance
   ability of equipment demand is higher, these factors will lead to the rapid increase of
   production cost, it is not conducive to reducing the production cost, and the process of
25 synthesis is complicated, so it is necessary to put forward a new method synthesis.
