BATTERY WITH ELECTROLYTE MIXING DEVICE
[0001] This is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2013351583, which
is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[0002] The invention refers to a battery with liquid electrolyte, preferably for use in moving
vehicles, such as for example in passenger cars, boats or airplanes, and with a device for
intermixing the electrolyte.
[0003] The pursuit in the automotive industry for lightweight construction also refers to saving
in battery weight. At the same time the demand for greater battery power is increasing, since
aside from the conventional energy needed, for example, to start a passenger car, energy for
additional aggregates, such as electrical window lifters, servomotors for adjusting the seats or
also electrical heating of the seats, is required. Furthermore, it is desirable to possibly maintain
the battery power at a constant high level over the life of the battery, since increasingly also
security related functions, such as steering and braking are controlled and operated electrically.
Battery power as used henceforth is understood as the capacity of the battery, as well as the
ability of the battery to supply and receive electric current. Battery power is affected by different
factors as known to those skilled in the art.
[0004] From the prior art, means are known to increase the power of a battery with a liquid
electrolyte, such as for example, a lead-acid-battery. A specific problem with lead-acid batteries
is the so-called stratification of the acid, that is, the acid concentration is not consistent with
respect to the electrode surface. This results in the corroding of the electrodes at points of the
electrode where the acid concentration is too high, thus diminishing the battery life, and due to
points on the electrode where the acid concentration is too low, the battery does not attain full
power.
[0005] Henceforth, the electrolyte is always identified as an acid because most applications of
the present invention refer to lead-acid batteries. The present invention is however applicable to
any liquid electrolyte battery the electrolyte of which tends toward stratification.
[0006] Accordingly, various devices and methods were developed to intermix the acid in order
for the acid concentration to be uniform as much as possible in all volume sections of the
battery. For example, in stationary batteries air is blown into the electrolyte.

                                                  2
[0007] For vehicle batteries some acid intermixing devices that exploit the mass inertia of the
acid at acceleration movements are known. This technology is known to the person skilled in the
art so that US 4,963,444 and DE 297 18 004.5 are only referred to as exemplary documents.
[0008] There are starter batteries of particular high construction. With these starter batteries, the
acid present in a riser channel, must be pushed by the acceleration over a greater distance from
the bottom upwards, which requires a larger amount of energy. Since the energy to move the
acid in the channel is generated through the vehicle acceleration, this amount is limited.
[0009] Object of the present invention is thus to provide a battery with an electrolyte
intermixing device that is so efficient that even batteries of higher construction can be well
intermixed.
[0010] This object is solved by means of a battery according to claim 1, wherein the battery
includes:
         a battery housing with side walls, a housing bottom and a covering. This arrangement
forms a battery cell. Normally, several such battery cells are compiled into a battery with a
multi-housing. In the preferably rectangular battery housing plate-shaped electrodes are
arranged in vertical disposition. The electrodes are completely covered with acid.
[0011] At least at one side wall of the battery housing, at a certain distance and parallel thereto a
flow channel plate is disposed, in such a way that a vertical and liquid-tight flow channel is
formed between the battery housing wall and the flow channel plate. Alternative to this
arrangement, the flow channel can also be formed as a double-walled flow channel plate, that is,
as a very compressed tube with a slot-shaped hollow space cross section.
[0012] The upper end of the flow channel thus represents an outflow slot. Next to the outflow
slot a mixing trough is provided and includes vertical side walls and a horizontal bottom. The
side wall of the mixing trough adjacent the outflow slot forms the overflow edge of the outflow
slot. The bottom of the mixing trough is always below the operationally intended minimum
level of the acid and is provided with at least one bottom opening of a predetermined cross
section.
[0013] As still further elaborated in the exemplary embodiment, upon acceleration of the vehicle
and thus the battery, a certain amount of acid is pushed upwardly through the vertical flow

                                                   3
channel so that acid exits from the outflow slot and runs across the overflow edge and into the
mixing trough. Since the flow channel plate extends at least to the lower third portion of the acid
volume and the acid there has a higher density, acid with this higher density is thus guided into
the mixing trough.
[0014] Simultaneously with the inflow of higher density acid into the mixing trough, during
acceleration, light acid, that is, acid of lower density located below the mixing trough is likewise
pushed through the bottom opening into the mixing trough.
[0015] Thus, an intermixing of acid of a higher density and acid of a lower density takes place
in the mixing trough.
[0016] In other words, in a battery resting state the acid of lower density is in the mixing trough,
as the mixing trough is connected via the bottom opening with the acid volume of the battery.
During acceleration, additional acid of lower density is pushed through the bottom opening into
the mixing trough and at the same time denser acid from the lower volume area of the battery
case is guided through the flow channel into the mixing trough. Accordingly, during
acceleration of the vehicle and thus the battery, there is more acid in the mixing trough than in
the resting state.
[0017] The intermixed acid which is in the mixing trough after the acceleration process,
henceforth called mixed acid, has a slightly higher density than the acid that flowed in through
the bottom opening and the acid that was already residing in the mixing trough before the
intermixing process. When reducing the acceleration to a zero value, of the mixed acid now
residing in the mixing trough, a greater amount flows through the bottom opening and a smaller
amount flows through the flow channel back into the battery case until the normal acid level is
restored again.
[0018] With the intermixing of the acid volumes of different density in the mixing trough, even
with batteries of greater height construction, a substantially better intermixing is realized as
compared to the conventional solutions of the prior art.
[0019] A faster recirculation of the electrolyte also results in a fast temperature adjustment
within the battery cell, thus increasing the life of the battery. This aspect is important, for
example, when the battery is installed in the motor space of a vehicle and heated on one side

                                                  4
through heat radiation from the motor. That way, the present invention has positive effects also
on standard batteries, such as a higher battery life as well as an improved ability regarding the
reception of electric current and also the supply of electric current.
[0020] According to claim 2 a further improvement of the intermixing is realized when the
bottom opening of the mixing trough is provided at the site at which the acid of higher density is
running to the bottom of the mixing trough, that is, directly next to the outflow slot. Since the
overflow of the denser acid from above into the mixing trough and the inflow of the thin acid
from below happen almost simultaneously, the acid volumes coming directly in contact with
each other are swirled about each other and become thus well intermixed.
[0021] According to claim 3, the interior facing wall of the mixing trough is provided with an
opening, which further improves the intermixing.
[0022] According to claim 4, a second mixing trough is provided joining the interior facing wall
of the first mixing trough, wherein at last one opening is provided in the bottom of the second
mixing trough. This further improves the intermixing.
[0023] According to claim 5, the bottom of the second mixing trough is located at the level of
the maximum level of the acid, that is, the bottom of the second mixing trough is higher than the
bottom of the first mixing trough. Thereby the intermixing is further improved.
[0024] The present invention is more closely described by means of the following exemplary
embodiment.
[0025] FIG. 1 shows a cross section view of a battery case cell and the acid levels in a first
phase.
[0026] FIG. 2 shows the subject matter according to Fig. 1 and the acid levels in a second phase.
[0027] FIG. 3 shows the subject matter according to Fig. 1 and the acid levels in a third phase.
[0028] FIG. 4 shows the subject matter according to Fig. 1 and the acid levels in a fourth phase.

                                                  5
[0029] FIG. 5 shows the subject matter according to Fig. 1 and the acid levels in a fifth phase,
which is identical to the first phase.
[0030] FIG. 6a, b shows the subject matter according to Fig. 1 in a modified embodiment and a
top view thereof.
[0031] FIG. 7 shows a perspective view of an intermixing device with two mixing troughs.
[0032] FIG. 8 shows a perspective view of an intermixing device with two mixing troughs in a
second embodiment.
[0033] FIG. 9 shows a perspective view of an empty battery case with 6 cells.
[0034] FIG. 1 shows a cross section view of a battery case cell. The battery case cell 1 has a
rectangular cross section with a bottom 2 and four side walls, wherein this illustration shows
only side walls 3 and 4. Reference numeral 5 designates the plate-shaped electrodes and
reference numeral 6 designates the battery acid, whose level 7 is between a maximum level 7a
and a minimum level 7b. As seen in the drawing, the level shown there is at the mark of the
maximum level 7a.
[0035] Between the side wall 3 and the electrodes 5, a flow channel plate 8 is vertically
disposed thus forming a flow channel 9. The end of the flow channel 9 thus forms an outflow
slot 9a.
[0036] Next to the outflow slot 9a, a mixing trough 10 is provided having side walls 1 la, 1Ib,
1 Ic and a bottom 12, wherein the side walls 11 a and 11 b are visible only in the perspective view
of Fig. 8. The upper end of the flow channel plate 8 forms an overflow edge 13. The bottom 12
of the mixing trough 10 is located always below the operationally intended minimum level 7b of
the battery acid 7 and is provided with at least one bottom opening 14 of a predetermined cross
section. Next to the mixing trough 10, an additional mixing trough 15 with a bottom opening 16
is provided, which is however optional and merely results in further improved intermixing.
[0037] Following is a description of the function of the intermixing device.

                                                    6
[0038] FIG. 1 shows a battery at rest with a horizontal electrolyte level 7. It is assumed that an
acid stratification has taken place in the battery, that is, the acid at the bottom of the battery has
a higher density than the acid in the upper battery section and also that residing in the mixing
trough.
[0039] FIG. 2 shows the motion of the acid at a positive acceleration of the vehicle to the right
in direction of the arrow. The same effect appears at a negative acceleration to the left, that is,
upon braking the vehicle that moves in direction of the arrow. Thereby, a sloped acid level 7
occurs in the mixing trough 10. Through the flow channel 9 acid with greater density streams
upwards and flows across the overflow edge 13 and into the mixing trough 10. In this motion
phase, acid of a lower density flows through the bottom opening 14 also into the mixing trough
10. As a result, in mixing trough 10 there is now a mixed acid that has a density that is lower
than the acid density at the bottom of the battery but higher than the acid density in the area of
the acid level.
[0040] In the optional mixing trough 15, due to the sloping acid level, some acid is guided
downwardly through the bottom opening 16.
[0041] FIG. 3 illustrates the situation where the constant acceleration is still in effect, but where
no equalizing streams occur any longer. This is indicated by the absence of the flow arrows.
[0042] FIG. 4 illustrates the situation where the acceleration is equal to zero, that is, the vehicle
is either driving at constant speed or is at a stand still. Accordingly, the acid levels are
horizontal. The flow arrows indicate that equalizing of the levels occurs via all three openings
9a, 14 and 16. It is especially emphasized that through the spatial distribution of the openings by
which the acid is thus flowing into and out from these various points, a faster intermixing is
realized.
[0043] FIG. 5 illustrates the situation as in FIG. 1 where the levels have equalized though the
acid is now intermixed.
[0044] FIG. 6a and 6b show a modified embodiment of the present invention in side view and in
top view. In mixing trough 10, the bottom opening 14 is located near the outflow slot 9a. This
leads to an especially effective intermixing of the acid volumes of different densities that flow
into each other and is symbolized with the ring arrow. Furthermore, three bottom openings 16

                                                   7
are provided in the second mixing trough 15. These openings are configured as small tubes
inserted obliquely into the bottom in order to create a flow resistance and thus effect an
additional turbulence and improved intermixing of the acid. This effect is further increased by
the oblique position of the small tubes 17.
[0045] FIG. 7 shows a perspective view of the intermixing device with two mixing troughs 10
and 15, wherein the bottom 18 of the second mixing trough 15 lies in the same plane as the
maximum level of the battery acid and has a recess 19.
[0046] FIG. 8 shows an intermixing device according to FIG. 7, which differs however in that
the interior side wall of the first mixing trough 10 is provided with a slot-shaped opening 20.
[0047] It is noted that the cross sections of the bottom and side openings of the first mixing
trough 10 can be optimized by the person skilled in the art. The cross-sectional shape of the
bottom and side openings does not have to be circular. In conventional passenger car batteries,
the cross sections of the openings in the bottom and in the side walls correspond to the cross
sections of circular openings with a diameter of 1.2 to 10mm and in truck batteries openings
with a diameter of 5-20mm.
[0048] FIG. 9 shows an empty battery case with 6 cells, wherein an intermixing device, for
example according to FIG. 8, can be disposed in each cell.
