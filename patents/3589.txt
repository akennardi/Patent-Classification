                                    DESCRIPTION
   AUTOCLAVE
   This application is a divisional application of Australian patent application no.
   2014229354, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
 5 The present invention relates to an autoclave of the type as recited in the pre
   amble of the first claim.
   In particular, the invention relates to a particular device apt to use steam, usual
   ly saturated steam, to eliminate micro-organisms (pathogens or non-pathogens
   or spores and fungi) from medical instruments and, in particular, from medical
10 dental instruments.
   As known, autoclaves sterilise medical instruments (by way of example probe
   tubes, mirrors, forceps, scalpels) by means of saturated steam at high tempera
   tures and pressures channelled inside a chamber in which the medical instru
   ments to be sterilised are placed.
15 They therefore comprise a sterilisation chamber inside which the instruments to
   be sterilised are placed; a supply apparatus suitable to vaporise a sterilisation
   solution (usually demineralised water) and emit it into the sterilisation chamber;
   a drainage apparatus for removing the residue (water vapour and condensate)
   from the sterilisation chamber; and a drying apparatus suitable to dry the in
20 struments at the end of sterilisation.
   The supply apparatus comprises a water tank, a steam generator, a plurality of
   ducts suitable to connect the steam generator to both the tank and the sterilisa
   tion chamber; and valves suitable to regulate the circulation of fluid inside said
   ducts.
25 In particular, the steam generator is usually place outside the sterilisation

                                              2
   chamber and connected thereto by means of ducts.
   Alternatively, the steam generator is a resistor inside the chamber which, at the
   moment of creating steam, is covered by the sterilisation fluid and thus heated
   so as to vaporise said fluid. In a further alternative, the steam generator is a re
 5 sistor band placed outside the pressurised recipient.
   The prior art described above has several significant drawbacks.
   A first significant drawback is represented by the fact that the prior autoclaves
   do not perform particularly well and, in particular, do not perform good quality
   sterilisations.
10 In fact, on account of the heat dispersion of the ducts and the chamber, the
   steam tends to cool and, in particular to form condensate thus deteriorating the
   sterilisation process.
   To try to resolve such drawback, some autoclaves heat the steam well beyond
   the temperature needed for sterilisation so as to offset the cooling and/or are
15 fitted with an additional resistor connected externally to the chamber so as to
   revaporise the condensate formed.
   Such solution however results in localised overheating at the point of said resis
   tor apt to deteriorate the structure of the chamber.
   Another drawback is the high consumption of autoclaves.
20 Such aspect is further increased by the need to heat the steam to temperatures
   well above those effectively needed for the sterilisation and/or the need to va
   porise any condensate, that is, to vaporise part of the sterilisation fluid twice.
   One significant drawback is represented by the large quantity of sterilisation flu
   id needed to perform the sterilisation.
25 Such drawback is particularly evident in autoclaves with a resistor inside the

                                            3
   sterilisation chamber where said inner resistor, in order to prevent its breakage
   by overheating, must always be immersed in the sterilisation fluid.
   Another drawback is consequently represented by the slowness of the sterilisa
   tion process on account of the slowness with which the autoclaves are able to
 5 create the conditions needed to perform sterilisation inside the sterilisation
   chamber.
   A further drawback can be identified in that the autoclaves currently used are of
   large dimensions.
   In particular, this latter drawback is particularly relevant in dental practices
10 where spaces are particularly limited and thus, the presence of an autoclave
   may get in the doctor's way.
   In this situation the technical purpose of the present invention is to devise an
   autoclave able to substantially overcome the drawbacks mentioned above.
   Within the sphere of said technical purpose one important aim of the invention
15 is to provide an autoclave able to ensure high quality, fast sterilisation.
   Another important aim of the invention is to obtain an autoclave of compact di
   mensions and with reduced consumption.
   The technical purpose and specified aims are achieved by an autoclave as
   claimed in the appended Claim 1.
20 Preferred embodiments are described in the dependent claims.
   The characteristics and advantages of the invention are clearly evident from the
   following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof, with reference
   to the accompanying drawings, in which:
        Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the autoclave;
25      Fig. 2 shows a portion of autoclave according to the invention; and

                                               4
        Fig. 3 illustrates an alternative solution to the portion in Fig. 2.
   With reference to said drawings, reference numeral 1 globally denotes the au
   toclave according to the invention.
   It is substantially composed of a system for performing the sterilisation of medi
 5 cal instruments and in particular medical-dental instruments and the like, using
   the vaporisation of demineralised water or other sterilisation fluid 1a.
   The autoclave 1, as shown in Fig. 1 mainly comprises, a sterilisation chamber
   20 suitable for defining a main extension axis 20a and a watertight space 20b
   in which to house the medical instruments to be sterilised; a supply system 30
10 of the sterilisation fluid 1a; a steam generator 40 positioned between the supply
   system 30 and sterilisation chamber 20 and suitable to vaporise the sterilisation
   fluid 1a; a drainage system 50 suitable for emptying the drainage fluid lb from
   the chamber 20.
   Preferably, the chamber 20 has an inner coating 21 suitable to thermally insu
15 late the watertight space 20b from the outside. Said inner coating 21 is made of
   ceramic or other material suitable to constitute said thermal insulation.
   The supply system 30 comprises a filler tank 31 suitable for storing the sterilisa
   tion fluid 1a; a supply pump 32 suitable to control the movement of the fluid 1a;
   a supply filter 33 suitable to filter the sterilisation fluid 1a; a supply cooler 34,
20 appropriately a finned heat exchanger, suitable to lower the temperature of the
   sterilisation fluid 1a; and supply ducts 35 suitable to permit the sterilisation fluid
   1a to cross, in order, the cooler 34, the filter 33 and then reach the steam gen
   erator 40.
   The supply filter 33 is suitable to reduce the bacterial load of the sterilisation
25 fluid la, eliminating bacteria and microorganisms present in the sterilisation flu-

                                              5
   id 1a, and preferably the conductivity by removing the metals dissolved in the
   sterilisation fluid 1a.
   It thus comprises a first filtering element made of a polymeric material, for ex
   ample, cellulose acetate, polyamide, polysulfone and polyacrylonitrile, or, an
 5 inorganic material, for example, cordierite, borosilicate glass and alumina; and
   a second filtering element made of resin or other similar material suitable to
   lower the content of dissolved minerals thereby reducing the conductivity of the
   fluid treated.
   In particular, the first filtering means has a filtering element made of inorganic
10 material and, more particularly, of the membrane type and even more particu
   larly, a porous ceramic-based filter.
   The second filtering element comprises a filtering element in resin and, specifi
   cally, in ionic exchange resin.
   The cooler 34 is suitable to cool the sterilisation fluid 1a bringing it to a temper
15 ature substantially below 50 0 C and, preferably, to a temperature substantially
   below 40 0 C so as to favour the functioning of the filter 33.
   Additionally, the supply system 30 comprises recirculation ducts 36 suitable to
   conduct the fluid in output from the supply filter 33 into the filler tank 31; and a
   recirculating valve 37 suitable to direct the sterilisation fluid la in output from
20 the supply filter 33 towards the generator 40, through the supply ducts 35 or, al
   ternatively, towards the tank 31 through the recirculation ducts 36.
   Appropriately, the recirculation valve 37 has a timer suitable to command the
   opening/closing of the valve 37 at regular intervals and, more specifically, the
   entrance or not of the sterilisation fluid 1a into the steam generator 40.
25 The steam generator 40 comprises at least one heat conductor 41 suitable to

                                              6
   house a contact and in particular to house the sterilisation fluid 1a; at least one
   heater 42 in contact with said heat conductor 41 so as to supply said heat con
   ductor 41 the heat needed to at least partially vaporise the fluid 1a; and con
   nectors 43 suitable to connect the heat conductor 41 and the sterilisation
 5 chamber 20.
   The heat conductor 41 is advantageously totally housed inside the sterilisation
   chamber 20 and, specifically, next to the bottom of the sterilisation chamber 20,
   that is in the area of minimal gravitational potential.
   In particular, the heat conductor 41 is connected in the sterilisation chamber 20
10 without defining spaces/interstices between the chamber 20 and the heat con
   ductor 41. More in particular, the heat conductor 41 is appropriately detachably
   connected to the sterilisation chamber 20 and to the heaters 42 so as to permit
   the extraction of the heat conductor 41 only from the chamber 20 without mov
   ing the aforesaid heaters 42, that is leaving them in the sterilisation chamber
15 20.
   Appropriately, as shown in Fig. 2, the steam generator 40 comprises two heat
   conductors 41 specular to each other, positioned at the bottom of the sterilisa
   tion chamber 20 and suitably distanced so as to define between them a collec
   tion channel 40a suitable to collect by gravity and to revaporise the condensate
20 present in the sterilisation chamber 20.
   The heat conductors 41 are made of a highly heat conductive material so that
   the heaters 42 heat the heat conductor 41 in a practically uniform manner.
   Preferably, they therefore have a heat conductivity substantially greater than
   100 W/mK, in particular, substantially greater than 200 W/mK and, even more
25 in particular, substantially at least equal to 250 W/mK.

                                            7
   Preferably, the heat conductors 41 are made of aluminium, copper, bronze or
   stainless steel.
   They are, in addition, appropriately coated with a corrosion-resistant layer suit
   able for preventing the corrosive action of the fluids la and 1b. Said corrosion
 5 resistant layer is made by means of chemical nickel-plating if the conductor 41
   is in copper (copper and bronze) or hard anodic oxidation if in aluminium.
   Each heat conductor 41 is identifiable in a single body defining at least one va
   porisation duct 41a, suitable to receive the sterilisation fluid la from the supply
   ducts 35 and to vaporise said fluid 1a.
10 The vaporisation duct 41a is of the blind type so that the sterilisation fluid la
   can only come out of it through the connectors 43.
   The connectors 43 are identifiable in holes made in the heat conductor 41 hav
   ing extension axes substantially perpendicular to the extension axis of the duct
   41a.
15 In particular, the extension axis defines an angle of inclination in relation to the
   gravitational gradient substantially below 450 so as to favour a spontaneous
   flow of steam from the vaporisation duct 41a to the chamber 20. Said angle is
   substantially less than 350 and, even more appropriately, substantially parallel
   to the gravitational gradient.
20 The generator 40 comprises one or more heaters 42 appropriately arranged in
   the sterilisation chamber 20 suitable to be housed in the chamber 20 in particu
   lar, at least partially housed and, more in particular, substantially totally housed
   in the heat conductors 41.
   Preferably, there are two heaters 42, each of which housed inside a heat con
25 ductor 41 and more preferably positioned next to the vaporisation duct 41a.

                                            8
   More in particular, the heaters 42 and the vaporisation ducts 41a are positioned
   at the collection channel 40a and present extension axes substantially parallel
   to the main extension axis 20a.
   The heaters 42 are identifiable in electric resistors appropriately fitted with a
 5 heat probe suitable to control the functioning of the electric resistors and thus
   keep the temperature of the heat conductors 41 substantially between 100
   170 0 C.
   Alternatively, the heaters 42 are resistors, preferably heat resistors and more
   preferably PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) heat resistors, that is to say
10 suitable to increase their resistance as the temperature rises and thus to regu
   late the temperature of the heat conductors 41 without the assistance of heat
   probes or the like.
   The drainage system 50 is suitable to empty the fluid lb from the chamber 20
   and consequently comprises a drainage tank 51 suitable to collect the drainage
15 fluid 1b; a drainage filter 52 substantially analogous to the supply filter 33 and
   suitable to purify the drainage fluid 1b; a drainage cooler 53, appropriately a
   finned heat exchanger, suitable to cool the drainage fluid lb before it reaches the
   filter 52; drainage valves 54 suitable to control the emptying of the fluid lb from
   the chamber 20; and drainage ducts 55 suitable to empty the drainage fluid lb
20 from the chamber 20 and to cross, in order, the cooler 53, the output filter 52
   and then reach the drainage tank 51.
   Additionally, the drainage system 50 may advantageously comprise a recovery
   apparatus 60 suitable to permit a partial re-utilisation of the drainage fluid lb
   and, in particular, to use the steam in output from the sterilisation chamber 20.
25 Said recovery apparatus 60 comprises a storage heat exchanger 61 suitable to

                                             9
   define a heat exchange between the fluids la and lb and to separate the
   steam and the condensate composing the drainage fluid 1b; a condensate
   valve 62 and emptying ducts 63 suitable to control the flow of fluid lb from the
   heat exchanger 61 to the drainage filter 52 and a recirculation system suitable
 5 to permit an exploitation of the drainage steam or alternatively of air coming
   from the outside.
   The storage heat exchanger 61 is positioned between the output filter 52 and
   cooler exit 53 and between the supply filter 33 and recirculation valve 37 and
   comprises a plate cooler 61a suitable to perform the heat exchange between
10 the fluids la and 1b; and an accumulator 61b suitable to define a storage space
   for the drainage fluid 1b in which the steam and condensate separate.
   In particular, the plate cooler 61a and the accumulator 61b are appropriately
   adjacent so that the drainage fluid 1b, stored in the accumulator 61b, defines a
   heat exchange with the sterilisation fluid 1a circulating in the plate cooler 61a.
15 The recirculation system comprises a vacuum pump 64 suitable to move the
   fluid in the recirculation system; an input valve 65 suitable to permit the vacuum
   pump 64 to call back steam from the heat exchanger 61 or air from outside the
   autoclave 1, one or more hygroscopic spaces 66 housed in the heat conductors
   41; a first control valve 67 suitable to permit the steam coming from the vacuum
20 pump 64 to reach the drainage filter 52 or, alternatively, the hygroscopic space
   66; a second control valve 68 suitable to direct the fluid coming from the hygro
   scopic space 66 towards the heat exchanger 61 or the vaporisation ducts 41a;
   and additional ducts 69 suitable to guide the steam or air into the recirculation
   system.

                                              10
   The hygroscopic volumes 66 are made in a material having hygroscopic proper
   ties consequent to an exothermic reaction such as to emit heat and in particu
   lar, dry hot air when they absorbs vapour and subsequently to emit steam when
   appropriately heated.
 5 Preferably the hygroscopic volumes 66 comprise Zeolite.
   In addition they present directions of extension substantially parallel to the main
   extension axis 20a so as to be substantially parallel to the vaporisation duct
   41a and to the heaters 42.
   Moreover there are preferably four hygroscopic volumes 66, two inside each
10 heat conductor 41 positioned symmetrically in relation to the collection channel
   40a next to the vaporisation ducts 41a and the heaters 42.
   The input valve 65 is functionally positioned between the vacuum pump 64 and
   the heat exchanger 61 and enables the pump 64 to make the steam coming
   from the accumulator 61b or air coming from outside through an air filter 65a
15 circulate in the system 60.
   The air filter 65a is suitable to reduce the bacterial load of the sterilisation fluid
   la, eliminating bacteria and microorganisms present in the air and, conse
   quently is substantially similar to the first filtering element of the supply filter 33
   described above.
20 Alternatively to the solution described above providing for two heat conductors
   41, as illustrated in Fig. 3, the steam generator 40 comprises a single heat con
   ductor 41 comprising at least one casing 41b, preferably one only, positioned
   inside the chamber 20 and at the bottom of said sterilisation chamber 20 and
   made of the aforesaid highly heat conductive material so as to vaporise the
25 possible condensate present in the chamber 20.

                                                11
   The casing 41b defines a single inner cavity identifying the vaporisation duct
   41a, suitable to contain the heaters 42 described above and the sterilisation flu
   id 1a so as to immerse the heaters 42 in the fluid 1a.
   In order to favour the immersion of the heaters 42 in the sterilisation fluid la,
 5 the casing 41b has a circular, appropriately oval cross-section, having a pre
   ferred barycentric direction of extension substantially parallel to the main ex
   tension axis 20a and extension substantially equal to that of the volume 20b
   and, additionally, the heaters 42 are positioned substantially along said bary
   centric direction of extension.
10 In this case, the connectors 43 are identifiable in a duct, appropriately external
   to the sterilisation chamber 20 and in a steam valve apt to enable, upon com
   mand, a fluid through connection between the vaporisation duct 41a and the
   chamber 20 and thus, the entry of the steam in the sterilisation chamber 20.
   The functioning of an autoclave, described above in a structural sense, is as
15 follows.
   Initially, the filler tank 31 is filled with a sterilisation fluid la, such as water la
   coming from an external mains supply, which is subsequently purified so as to
   eliminate the bacterial load present in the fluid 1a and reduce its conductivity.
   In particular, during said purification, the recirculation valve 37 connects the
20 supply filter 33 to the filler tank 31 creating a recirculation of the sterilisation flu
   id la which, thus, after crossing the storage heat exchanger 61, the supply
   cooler 34 and the supply filter 33, returns to the filler tank 31.
   At the same time or alternatively, subsequent to the purification of the sterilisa
   tion fluid la the sterilisation of the medical instruments takes place.
25 The operator places the medical instruments inside the sterilisation chamber

                                             12
   and commands the heaters 42 to heat the heat conductors 41 bringing them to
   a temperature substantially comprised between 100-170 0 C.
   In detail, the conductors 41, being in highly heat conductive material, heat
   evenly and thus so as to begin to heat the chamber 20 and, at the same time,
 5 make the hygroscopic volumes 66 regenerate releasing the steam accumulated
   therein in a previous sterilisation.
   Such steam is distanced from the volumes 66 by the vacuum pump 64 which by
   withdrawing air through the filter 65a and directing it into the hygroscopic vol
   umes 66, guides the steam into the ducts 41a and thus into the sterilisation
10 chamber 20.
   The entrance of this steam in the chamber 20 and the vacuum pressure created
   by the pump 64 in the accumulator 61b empties the fluid lb from the sterilisa
   tion chamber 20. Such drainage fluid lb then reaches the accumulator 61b
   from where the condensate, precisely of said drainage fluid 1b, is pushed into
15 the drainage tank 51 through the condensate valve 62.
   At this point, the vacuum phase begins, in which the condensate valve 62 is
   closed while the vacuum pump 64 withdraws steam from the accumulator 61b
   and directs it into the drainage filter 53, and then, into the drainage tank 51 so
   as to complete the emptying of the accumulator 61 b.
20 It may be seen how during the regeneration of the volumes 66 and the empty
   ing of the accumulator 61b, the sterilisation fluid la, circulating in the supply
   system 30, passes into the plate cooler 61a and thus cools by conduction the
   drainage fluid 1b present in the accumulator 61b.
   Once the heat conductors 41 have reached the desired temperature, the vacu
25 um pump 64 is turned off, the drainage valves 54 are closed, while the conden-

                                              13
   sate valve 62 is opened and the valve 65 connects the pump 64 with the out
   side and the second control valve 68 connects the hygroscopic volumes 66 to
   the accumulator 61b.
   The pressurisation of the sterilisation chamber 20 commences.
 5 In detail, in this step the recirculation valve 37, using the timer, directs the fluid
   la, alternately and at regular intervals, towards the filler tank 31 or the vapori
   sation ducts 41a so that only a determined amount of sterilisation fluid la
   reaches the generator 40.
   The sterilisation fluid then enters the vaporisation ducts 41a of the heat conduc
10 tors 41, is vaporised and, through the connectors 43, comes out of the ducts
   41a into the chamber 20.
   Moreover, during such vaporisation, should the sterilisation chamber 20 not be
   uniformly heated, it absorbs heat from the steam which thus condenses, precip
   itates by gravity into the collection channel 40a where, coming into contact with
15 the heat conductors 41, it is newly vaporised.
   If the conditions of the fluid present in the sterilisation chamber 20 are not as
   desired the steps of emptying and filling are cyclically repeated until these are
   achieved.
   Once the chamber 20 has achieved the conditions the sterilisation is per
20 formed.
   After sterilisation is complete, the condensate valve 62 is closed, while the vac
   uum pump 64 calls back the gas/steam present in the accumulator 61b and
   sends it through the first control valve 67 to the drainage filter 52 and then to
   the drainage tank 51.
25 This action calls back the drainage fluid lb present in the sterilisation chamber

   20 by means of vacuum pressure and through the drainage valves 54 which
   thus crosses the drainage cooler 53 and passes into the plate cooler 61a.
   The drainage fluid 1b lastly reaches the accumulator where it is stored so as to
   be separated into condensate and steam and to be cooled by the sterilisation
 5 fluid 1a circulating in the plate cooler 61a.
   When such step is completed, the vacuum pump 64 aspirates air from outside
   which after being purified/sterilised by the filter 65a is introduced into the hy
   groscopic volumes 66. Such input of air, together with the heat of the heat con
   ductors 41, makes the hygroscopic volumes 66 regenerate completely and thus
10 release steam which is pushed into the ducts 41a.
   Additionally, such passage of air lowers the temperature of the heat conductors
   41 which thus identify an area of the chamber 20 at reduced temperature, that
   is to say a cold point which favours the condensation of the steam present in
   the chamber 20 and consequently the drying of the instruments.
15 Once the hygroscopic volumes 66 are regenerated the drying of the medical in
   struments is completed by means of a jet of hot air.
   In detail, the pump 64, by means of the input valve 65, calls back steam from
   the accumulator 61b and brings it to the hygroscopic volumes 66 which fill, re
   leasing heat which heats the chamber 20 through the heat conductors 41 and
20 dry air which is introduced back into the chamber through the connectors 43 so
   as to dry the medical instruments.
   Once such operation has been completed, the operator removes the medical
   instruments from the autoclave 1, and then proceeds with another sterilisation.
   The invention achieves some important advantages.
25 A first important advantage is the particularly high quality sterilisation which can

                                            15
   be achieved with the autoclave 1.
   Such aspect is achieved by the presence of the heat conductors 41 in the steri
   lisation chamber 20 which, by creating steam directly in the chamber 20 pre
   vents heat dispersion and thus prevents the steam from cooling and forming
 5 condensate.
   In particular, such aspect is additionally prevented by the arrangement of the
   heat conductors 41 on the bottom of the chamber 20 and in particular, by the
   creation of the collection channel 40a inside which any condensate accumu
   lates permitting said heat conductors to re-vaporise it.
10 Another advantage of the autoclave 1 is therefore the fact that, the sterilisation
   fluid la present in the chamber is always high quality and, in particular, at an
   ideal sterilisation temperature.
   Another advantage is given by the particular arrangement of the hygroscopic
   volumes 66 which, being housed in the heat conductors 41 and thus in the
15 sterilisation chamber 20 make it possible to exploit their absorption phase both
   to heat said chamber and to generate dry hot air.
   Moreover, this arrangement of the hygroscopic volumes 66 makes it possible to
   exploit the heating of the heat conductors both to generate steam and to re
   generate the hygroscopic volumes 66.
20 Such particular exploitation of the hygroscopic volumes 66 has been innova
   tively achieved in part thanks to the heat exchanger 61 which thanks to the
   presence of the accumulator 61b defines a collection point for the waste fluid
   lb suitable to permit the separation of the condensate and steam and thus, the
   particular exploitation of the steam through the volumes 66.
25 A further advantage given by the presence of the heat exchanger 61 and the

                                           16
   coolers 34 and 53 is the possibility of having the fluids la and lb at an ideal
   temperature when they reach the filters 33 and 52.
   One advantage is the fact that, the autoclave 1, by having the steam generator
   40 inside the chamber 20 is particularly compact compared to the prior sterilis
 5 ers and thus suitable to allow better use of the doctor's available space.
   Another advantage is given by the presence of the timer which enables the re
   circulation valve 37 to send at regular intervals a determined quantity of sterili
   sation fluid 1a to the generator 40 optimising the vaporisation of the sterilisation
   fluid la.
10 Such aspect is further given by the definition of the blind vaporisation ducts 41a
   which allow the sterilisation fluid la to stay inside them and thus to be com
   pletely vaporised and by the fact that should the sterilisation fluid la come out
   of them through the connectors 43 it falls by gravity into the collection channel
   40a where it is vaporised by the heat conductors 41.
15 Another advantage is given by the presence of the heat conductors 41 and, in
   particular, by their arrangement on the bottom of the chamber 20 making it
   possible to keep the condensate present in said chamber heated even during
   the depressurisation of the chamber 20.
   One advantage is given, as described in the functioning of the autoclave 1, by
20 the possibility of introducing sterile and heated dry air into the sterilisation
   chamber 20 which makes it possible to dry the medical instruments in an ex
   tremely rapid, safe manner.
   One important advantage is given by the possibility of removing the heat con
   ductors 41 from the sterilisation chamber 20 to permit easy cleaning of the au
25 toclave 1.

                                             17
   Moreover, such operation is facilitated by the fact that the heaters 42, remain
   ing permanently connected to the chamber 20, remain still during the extraction
   and insertion of the conductors 41 and thus guide the movement thereof.
   Another important advantage is the use of the casing 41b which, being suitable
 5 to contain within it sterilisation fluid la at high temperatures, defines a heat
   source for the sterilisation chamber 20, favouring the heating thereof.
   Such heating of the chamber 20 proves particularly advantageous both during
   drying of the instruments by favouring the heating of the air present in the auto
   clave and during the sterilisation of the instruments vaporising the condensate
10 which has possibly formed and preventing a dangerous cooling of the sterilisa
   tion chamber 20.
   Another advantage of no less importance is the possibility of using air coming from
   outside to rapidly cool the sterilisation chamber 20 and then, perform a vacuum
   test of the autoclave 1 at any moment without particular expectations.
