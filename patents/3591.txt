   Detailed Description
10
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a method and a
   gaming system for implementing the method. In one aspect,
   the method of gaming includes receiving a selection of
   combinations of symbol display positions of a set of
15 symbol display positions at which symbols will be selected
   to be displayed in a game round. The method further
   includes evaluating whether the symbols displayed in each
   selected combination for the game round correspond to
   jackpot events associated with respective ones of a
20 plurality of jackpots to thereby determine whether to
   award one or more of the jackpots in respect of each
   selected combination.
   General construction of gaming system
25
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
30
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
35 game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
                                            10133202_1 (GHMatters) P81477.AU.4 3/04/2018

   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
 5 operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
10 envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
15 machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
20 Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
   core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
25 the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
30 Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
35 enable a player to input game play instructions            (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
                                            10133202_1 (GHMatters) P81477.AU.4 3/04/2018

                               - 8
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
 5 display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:             a
10 microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
15 machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
20 interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
25 reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
30 shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
35 reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
                                            10133202_1 (GHMatters) P81477.AU.4 3/04/2018

                               - 9
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module.
 5 A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.          Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
10 beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
15 device.  Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.   The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
20 of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
   type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
25 different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
30 processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.   Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
35 memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
                                             10133202_1 (GHMatters) P81477.AU.4 3/04/2018

                               - 10
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
 5 peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.           Persons
lo skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
15 controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
20 included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
25 input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game.
30 In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
35 database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                     In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
                                             10133202_1 (GHMatters) P81477.AU.4 3/04/2018

                              - 11
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module - i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.

   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
10 execution by the processor 102 and related data.                The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
15 the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
20 input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
25 network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
30 machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
35
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
                                            10133202_1 (GHMatters) P81477.AU.4 3/04/2018

                               - 12
    associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
    The displays 204 may be used to display representations
    associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
    and/or used to display other representations, for example
  5 promotional or informational material.
    In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
    part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
    202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
10  game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
    the gaming device implement part of the game, they
    collectively provide a game controller. A database
    management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
    and associated data for downloading or access by the
15  gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
    gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
    game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
    accounting functions for the Jackpot game.       A loyalty
    program server 212 may also be provided.
20
    In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
    most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
    machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
    provides only the player interface.  With this embodiment,
25  the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
    gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
    these to the game server which will process them and
    return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
    display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
30  could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
    that provides a player interface operable using standard
    computer input and output components. Other client/server
    configurations are possible, and further details of a
    client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
35  and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
    incorporated herein by reference.

   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
 5 relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
10 systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
15 accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
20 server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
25 may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Further detail of gaming system
30 In one embodiment, a player operates the game play
   mechanism 56 to input a selection of symbol display
   positions at which selected symbols will be displayed on
   the display 54 in a game round of a game. In addition, the
   player may also operate the game play mechanism 56 to
35 input a wager, or a number of credits bet, or played, per
   selected combinations of symbol display positions.
                                            10133202_1 (GHMatters) P81477.AU.4 3/04/2018

                               - 14
   The inputted selection and wager is then be used to
   initiate play of a game, or a game round of a game, and
   specify a win entitlement which will be evaluated for this
   play of the game. Persons skilled in the art will
 5 appreciate that a player's win entitlement will vary from
   game to game dependent on player selections. In most
   spinning reel games, it is typical for the player's
   entitlement to be affected by the amount they wager and
   selections they make  (i.e. the nature of the wager).                    For
10 example, a player's win entitlement may be based on how
   many lines they select to play in each game - e.g. a
   minimum of one line up to the maximum number of lines
   allowed by the game  (noting that not all permutations of
   win lines may be available for selection).       Such win or pay
15 lines are typically formed by a combination of symbol
   display positions, one from each reel or column, the
   symbol display positions being located relative to one
   another such that they form a line.
20 In many games, the player's win entitlement is not
   strictly limited to the lines they have selected, for
   example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
   players selection of pay lines and are an inherent part of
   the win entitlement.
25
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in other
   embodiments the player may obtain a win entitlement by
   selecting a number of reels to play to thereby select
   combinations of symbol display positions to be evaluated.
30 Such games are marketed under the trade name "Reel Power"
   by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd. The selection of
   the reel means that each displayed symbol of the reel can
   be substituted for a symbol at one or more designated
   display positions. In other words, all symbols displayed
35 at symbol display positions corresponding to a selected
   reel can be used to form symbol combinations with symbols
   displayed at a designated,   symbol display positions of the
                                              10133202_1 (GHMatters) P81477.AU.4 3/04/2018

                              - 15
   other reels. For example, if there are five reels and
   three symbol display positions for each reel such that the
   symbol display positions comprise three rows of five
   symbol display positions, the symbols displayed in the
 5 centre row are used for non-selected reels. As a result,
   the total number of ways to win is determined by
   multiplying the number of active display positions of each
   reel, the active display positions being all display
   positions of each selected reel and the designated display
10 positions of the non-selected reels. As a result for five
   reels and fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to
   win.
   In the embodiment, the pay table 642A enables a player to
15 win a plurality of jackpots which may be awarded in
   respect of each game round and in respect of each
   combination of symbol display positions, which may be
   defined by selecting pay lines or reels as described
   above. The jackpots have different values and in one
20 example there is a major jackpot and a minor jackpot of
   lesser value to be awarded.
   In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
   shown implementing a number of modules based on program
25 code and data stored in memory 64 to generate and evaluate
   game outcomes. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
   that several of the modules could be implemented in some
   other way, for example by a dedicated circuit, or on a
   server remote from the game controller 60.
30
   In the embodiment, shown in Figure 6, the modules of the
   game controller 60 include a outcome generator 622 which
   operates in response to the player's operation of game
   play mechanism 56 to initiate a play of the game to
35 generate a game outcome which will then be evaluated by an
   outcome evaluator 623. The first part of forming the game
   outcome is for a symbol selector 622A to select symbols
                                            10133202_1 (GHMatters) P81477.AU.4 3/04/2018

                              - 16
   from a set of symbols specified by symbol data 641 using a
   random number generator 621. The selected symbols are
   advised to the display controller 624 which causes them to
   be displayed on display 54 at combinations of symbol
 5 display positions. For example, the display controller 624
   displays symbols in symbol display positions arranged in
   columns, generally representing reels, such that a player
   selected combination of symbol display positions includes
   one symbol display position from each column.
10
   One example of selecting symbols for display is for the
   symbol selector 622A to select symbols from a plurality of
   symbol sets corresponding to respective ones of a
   plurality of spinning reels. In the embodiment, the
15 symbols sets 641 include wild symbols that indicate a
   value of jackpot to be award. Specifically, the symbols
   sets 641 include different types of wild symbols that
   indicate different jackpots to be awarded respectively.
20 The symbol sets 641 can also specify a sequence of symbols
   for each reel such that the symbol selector 622A can
   select all of the symbols by selecting a stopping position
   in the sequence. In one example, three symbols of each of
   five reels may be displayed such that symbols are
25 displayed at fifteen display positions on display 54. It
   is known to use a probability table stored in memory 64 to
   vary the odds of a particular stop position being
   selected. Other techniques can be used to control the odds
   of particular game outcomes occurring to thereby control
30 the return to the player of the game.
   In an example of a game round of a game, the outcome
   generator 622 generates a game outcome by advising the
   symbol selector 622A to select symbols for the game round,
35 from symbol data 641, to be evaluated by the outcome
   evaluator 623. The outcome evaluator 623 evaluates whether
   the symbols selected by the symbol selector 622A to be
                                            10133202_1 (GHMatters) P81477.AU.4 3/04/2018

                              - 17
   displayed in player selected combinations of symbol
   display positions correspond to designated wining
   combinations and/or one or more jackpot events associated
   with respective ones of a plurality of jackpots.
 5
   In one embodiment, each jackpot event includes at least
   one wild symbol, specified by symbol data 641, adapted to
   substitute for any symbol in the selected combination of
   symbols. In this case, a jackpot event may include a
10 winning combination of symbols where at least one of those
   symbols is a wild symbol, e.g. a combination including
   four aces and one substituting wild symbol. Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that other winning
   combinations may be designated in the pay table 642A. For
15 example, in some games, four aces or five symbols forming
   a straight (A, K, Q, J, 10) on a pay line may be
   designated as winning combinations. In the embodiment,
   there are at least two jackpot events which can occur at
   the same time. This is provided by two different types of
20 wild symbols associated with respective jackpots such that
   if they both substitute in a designated combination, both
   jackpots are awarded.
   In one embodiment, each type of wild symbol indicates the
25 value of the respective jackpot to be awarded. Thus, using
   the above example of the jackpots including major and
   minor jackpots, one type of wild symbol indicates that the
   major jackpot is to be awarded if it substitutes in a
   winning combination of symbols and another type of wild
30 symbol indicates that the minor jackpot is to be awarded
   if it also substitutes in a winning combination. In this
   case, the symbol data 641 includes respective major and
   minor wild symbols. In one example, if the game evaluator
   623 evaluates a game outcome comprised of a selected
35 combination of symbols forming a winning combination with
   a major wild symbol and a minor wild symbol, then the game
   evaluator 623 determines that both the major and minor
                                           10133202_1 (GHMatters) P81477.AU.4 3/04/2018

                               - 18
   jackpots are to be awarded.
   In addition, the symbol data may also include a wild type
   symbol that only substitutes for any symbol and does not
 5 indicate that a respective jackpot is to be awarded.
   In Figure 7, a portion of the display 54 is shown to
   include a plurality of symbol display positions 700,
   arranged in columns, where each combination of symbol
10 display positions to be played includes one symbol from
   each column. In the example of a game outcome shown, there
   are five combinations 710 of symbol display positions, or
   pay lines, which can be selected to be played by a player
   in a game round. The symbols selected by the symbol
15 selector 622A and displayed in each pay line for the game
   round are summarised in Table 1 below.
             Line 1: K,  K, K, Major, A
             Line 2: A,  A, Minor, A, A
20           Line 3: K, Q, Q, Q, Wild
             Line 4: A,  K, Q, Major, A
             Line 5: K, K, Minor, Major, Wild
                        Table 1
25
   It can be seen that in the combination of symbol display
   positions designated as Line 1, a Major symbol 720 is
   displayed and can substitute for a K symbol, and thus the
   Major symbol can be incorporated into a winning
30 combination of four kings. In this case, the outcome
   evaluator 623 evaluates, if the player selected to play
   Line 1, that a major jackpot event has occurred so that a
   major jackpot can be awarded to the player. In some
   embodiments, in addition to the major jackpot being
35 awarded, a value for obtaining four kings is also paid to
   the player. It can also be seen that the outcome evaluator
   623 will evaluate, if the player selected to play Line 2,
                                            10133202_1 (GHMatters) P81477.AU.4 3/04/2018

                               - 19
   that a Minor symbol 730 can substitute for an A symbol to
   form a winning combination of symbols, and thus a minor
   jackpot is to be awarded to the player. Also, in the
   example shown, the outcome evaluator 623 would evaluate
 5 that the symbols selected for display in Lines 3 and 4 do
   not result in any pay or award.
   In the example where the player selects Line 5 to be
   played in the game round, the outcome evaluator 623
10 evaluates that both the Major and Minor jackpot symbols
   occur on the same pay line and can both be used to
   substitute for K symbols to form a winning combination of
   five kings, as Line 5 also includes a conventional Wild
   symbol 740 which can substitute for any symbol. In this
15 example, the outcome evaluator 623 evaluates that the
   combination of selected symbols in Line 5 corresponds to
   both a major and minor jackpot event and thus both the
   major and minor jackpots are to be awarded to the player
   at the same time.
20
   Referring back to Figure 6, in one embodiment, the game
   evaluator 623 also determines the value of the major and
   minor jackpots and the quantum of any prize from a winning
   combination of symbols to be made from the initiate play
25 instruction  (e.g. the selected combinations played and the
   number of credits per selection) to thereby control the
   return to the player of the game. The prize data may be
   accumulated at a win meter and stored as meter data 643 to
   be awarded to the player. In some cases, the value of the
30 jackpots increment progressively and once a jackpot is
   awarded its value is reset. Also, once all game outcomes
   have been generated and a further game play instruction is
   required before any further play can occur, credits are
   transferred to a credit meter in meter data 643.
35
   As described above, the player inputs a selection of at
   least one combination of symbol display positions and a
                                            10133202_1 (GHMatters) P81477.AU.4 3/04/2018

                              - 20
   wager using the game play mechanism 56 to initiate play of
   a game. In one embodiment, at least a portion of the wager
   is placed on each selected combination and the outcome
   generator 622 can modify the sets of symbols stored in
 5 symbol data 641 from which the symbol selector 622A
   selects. With reference to the example shown in Figure 7,
   the plurality of symbols display positions 700 are
   arranged in five columns or reels, referred to herein as
   reels one to five, and the outcome generator 622 can
10 modify the sets of symbols for each reel according to a
   value of the wager placed on each selected combination.
   For example, for a wager of one credit per selected
   combination, the set of symbols for reels one and two
   contain zero wild symbols out of twenty two symbols in the
15 set.  In the example, the set of symbols for reels three
   and four contain four wild symbols, and the set of symbols
   for reel five contains one wild symbol out of the twenty
   two symbols. In addition, of the four wild symbols on reel
   three, two are Minor symbols and the other two are plain
20 wild symbols. Of the four symbols on reel four, two are
   Major symbols. However, for two credits per selected
   combination, the outcome generator 622 modifies the sets
   of symbols stored in symbol data 641 so that the set of
   symbols for reel three now contains four Minor symbols and
25 the set of symbols for reel four now contains four Major
   symbols.
   A method of gaming is summarised in Figures 8 and 9. The
   method 800 of Figure 8 includes receiving 810 a selection
30 of at least one combination of symbol display positions in
   a game round and then selecting 820 symbols to be
   displayed in these symbol display positions in the game
   round. The method further includes evaluating 830 whether
   the symbols displayed in each selected combination for the
35 game round correspond to one or more jackpot events
   associated with respective ones of a plurality of
   jackpots, and awarding 840 one or more of the jackpots in
                                           10133202_1 (GHMatters) P81477.AU.4 3/04/2018

                               - 21
   respect of each selected combination accordingly. The
   method 900 of Figure 9 also includes the steps of
   receiving 910 a selection of at least one combination of
   symbol display positions and selecting 920 symbols in a
 5 game round. However, the method 900 further includes
   evaluating 930 whether the symbols displayed in each
   selected combination correspond to one or more jackpot
   event comprising one or more respective wild symbols
   associated with respective jackpots of different values.
10 Thus, the method 900 subsequently includes awarding 940
   any number of jackpots in respect of each selected
   combination incorporating respective wild symbols in
   winning combinations.
15 Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the gaming system. Persons skilled in
   the art will also appreciate that the above method could
   be embodied in program code. The program code could be
   supplied in a number of ways, for example on a computer
20 readable storage medium, such as a disc or a memory (for
   example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as a
   data signal  (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).
25 It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
   embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
30 further embodiments.
