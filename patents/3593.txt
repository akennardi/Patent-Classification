                                FIELD OF THE INVENTION
        The present invention relates to nucleic acid sequences encoding consensus prostate
proteins and fragments thereof; to improved prostate cancer vaccines, improved methods for
inducing immune responses against prostate cancer cells, improved methods for
prophylactically and/or therapeutically immunizing individuals against prostate cancer.
                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
        Prostate cancer is an important therapeutic immune target. The development of an
immune therapeutic approach is complex, in that immunogens need to be developed that are
capable of inducing strong immune responses including preferably CTL responses.
        The direct administration of nucleic acid sequences to vaccinate against animal and
human diseases has been studied and much effort has focused on effective and efficient
means of nucleic acid delivery in order to yield necessary expression of the desired antigens,
resulting immunogenic response and ultimately the success of this technique.
        DNA vaccines have many conceptual advantages over more traditional vaccination
methods, such as live attenuated viruses and recombinant protein-based vaccines. DNA
vaccines are safe, stable, easily produced, and well tolerated in humans with preclinical trials
indicating little evidence of plasmid integration [Martin, T., et al., Plasmid DNA malaria
vaccine: the potential for genomic integration after intramuscular injection. Hum Gene Ther,
1999. 10(5): p. 759-68; Nichols, W.W., et al., Potential DNA vaccine integration into host
                                               -1-

cell genome. Ann N Y Acad Sci, 1995. 772: p. 30-9]. In addition, DNA vaccines are well
suited for repeated administration due to the fact that efficacy of the vaccine is not
influenced by pre-existing antibody titers to the vector [Chattergoon, M., J. Boyer, and D.B.
Weiner, Genetic immunization: a new era in vaccines and immune therapeutics. FASEB J,
1997. 11(10): p. 753-63]. However, one major obstacle for the clinical adoption of DNA
vaccines has been a decrease in the platform's immunogenicity when moving to larger
animals [Liu, M.A. and J.B. Ulmer, Human clinical trials of plasmid DNA vaccines. Adv
Genet, 2005. 55: p. 25-40]. Recent technological advances in the engineering of DNA
vaccine immunogen, such has codon optimization, RNA optimization and the addition of
immunoglobulin leader sequences have improved expression and immunogenicity of DNA
vaccines [Andre, S., et al., Increased immune response elicited by DNA vaccination with a
synthetic gp120 sequence with optimized codon usage. J Virol, 1998. 72(2): p. 1497-503;
Dem, L., et al., Multiple effects of codon usage optimization on expression and
immunogenicity of DNA candidate vaccines encoding the human immunodeficiency virus
type I Gag protein. J Virol, 2001. 75(22): p. 10991-1001; Laddy, D.J., et al.,
Immunogenicity of novel consensus-based DNA vaccines against avian influenza. Vaccine,
2007. 25(16): p. 2984-9; Frelin, L., et al., Codon optimization and mRNA amplification
effectively enhances the immunogenicity of the hepatitis C virus nonstructural 3/4A gene.
Gene Ther, 2004. 11(6): p. 522-33].
         Recent technological advances in plasmid delivery systems have improved
expression and immunogenicity of DNA vaccines including technologies such as
electroporation [Hirao. L.A., et al., Intradermal/subcutaneous immunization by
electroporation improves plasmid vaccine delivery and potency in pigs and rhesus
macaques. Vaccine, 2008. 26(3): p. 440-8; Luckay, A., et al., Effect of plasmid DNA
vaccine design and in vivo electroporation on the resulting vaccine-specific immune
responses in rhesus macaques. J Virol, 2007. 81(10): p. 5257-69; Ahlen, G., et al., In vivo
electroporation enhances the immunogenicity of hepatitis C virus nonstructural 3/4A DNA
by increased local DNA uptake, protein expression, inflammation, and infiltration of CD3+
T cells. J Imnnunol, 2007. 179(7): p. 4741-53].
         In addition, studies have suggested that the use of consensus immunogens can be
able to increase the breadth of the cellular immune response as compared to native antigens
alone [Yan, J., et al., Enhanced cellular immune responses elicited by an engineered HIV-I
subtype B consensus-based envelope DNA vaccine. Mol Ther, 2007. 15(2): p. 411-21;

Rolland, M., et al., Reconstruction and function of ancestral center-of-tree human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 proteins. J Virol, 2007. 81(16): p. 8507-14]. However, it is
recognized that breaking immune tolerance for cancer antigens and generating autoimmunity
is a major obstacle for cancer vaccines.
        There still remains a need for nucleic acid constructs that encode prostate cancer
antigens and for compositions useful to induce immune responses against prostate cancer
antigens and thus break immune tolerance. There remains a need for effective prophylactic
and therapeutic vaccines against prostate cancer that are economical and effective.

                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         Provided herein are consensus sequence prostate proteins and isolated nucleic acid
molecules that encode them, and in particular, the prostate antigens prostate specific antigen
(PSA), prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), six-transmembrane epithelial antigen
of the prostate antigen (STEAP) and prostate specific stem cell antigen (PSCA).
         The prostate cancer antigens described herein are consensus sequences derived from
a pool of homologous antigens from across multiple species, including the specie that the
vaccine is targeted for. The selected species from which antigen sequences are aligned to
form a consensus shall be chosen based on close proximity of the species on a phylogenic
tree, e.g., H.sapiens (humans), M.mulatta (rhesus macaques), and M.fascicularis
(cynomolgus monkey). The consensus antigen is not identical to the native prostate antigen
but will have close identity, which sequences share at least 85%, and preferably 90%, 91%,
92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity. These described consensus cancer
antigens are able to break tolerance in the targeted specie (or cause autoimmunity) and
generate an effective immune response against the prostate cancer antigen. Provided herein
are methods to generate a consensus cancer antigen based DNA vaccine.

that comprise a nucleotide sequence which encodes a protein. The coding sequence includes
initiation and termination signals operably linked to regulatory elements including a
promoter and polyadenylation signal capable of directing expression in the cells of the
individual to whom the nucleic acid molecule is administered. As used herein, the term

operable linked to a coding sequence that encodes a protein such that when present in the
cell of the individual, the coding sequence will be expressed.
         i.  Homology
         Homology of multiple sequence alignments and phylogram were generated using
ClustalW, a general purpose multiple sequence alignment program for DNA or proteins.
         j.  Identical
         "Identical" or "identity" as used herein in the context of two or more nucleic acids or
polypeptide sequences, means that the sequences have a specified percentage of residues
that are the same over a specified region. The percentage can be calculated by optimally
                                                -15-

aligning the two sequences, comparing the two sequences over the specified region,
detennining the number of positions at which the identical residue occurs in both sequences
to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the
total number of positions in the specified region, and multiplying the result by 100 to yield
the percentage of sequence identity. In cases where the two sequences are of different
lengths or the alignment produces one or more staggered ends and the specified region of
comparison includes only a single sequence, the residues of single sequence are included in
the denominator but not the numerator of the calculation. When comparing DNA and RNA,
thymine (T) and uracil (U) can be considered equivalent. Identity can be performed
manually or by using a computer sequence algorithm such as BLAST or BLAST 2.0.
         k. Immune Response
         "Immune response" as used herein means the activation of a host's immune system,
e.g., that of a mammal, in response to the introduction of antigen such as a prostate
consensus antigen. The immune response can be in the form of a cellular or humoral
response, or both.
         1. Nucleic Acid
         "Nucleic acid" or "oligonucleotide" or "polynucleotide" as used herein means at
least two nucleotides covalently linked together. The depiction of a single strand also
defines the sequence of the complementary strand. Thus, a nucleic acid also encompasses
the complementary strand of a depicted single strand. Many variants of a nucleic acid can
be used for the same purpose as a given nucleic acid. Thus, a nucleic acid also encompasses
substantially identical nucleic acids and complements thereof. A single strand provides a
probe that can hybridize to a target sequence under stringent hybridization conditions. Thus,
a nucleic acid also encompasses a probe that hybridizes under stringent hybridization
conditions.
         Nucleic acids can be single stranded or double stranded, or can contain portions of
both double stranded and single stranded sequence. The nucleic acid can be DNA, both
genomic and cDNA, RNA, or a hybrid, where the nucleic acid can contain combinations of
deoxyribo- and ribo-nucleotides, and combinations of bases including uracil, adenine,
thymine, cytosine, guanine, inosine, xanthine hypoxanthine, isocytosine and isoguanine.
Nucleic acids can be obtained by chemical synthesis methods or by recombinant methods.
         m. Operably Linked
         "Operably linked" as used herein means that expression of a gene is under the
control of a promoter with which it is spatially connected. A promoter can be positioned 5'
                                              -16-

(upstream) or 3' (downstream) of a gene under its control. The distance between the
promoter and a gene can be approximately the same as the distance between that promoter
and the gene it controls in the gene from which the promoter is derived. As is known in the

         n. Promoter
         "Promoter" as used herein means a synthetic or naturally-derived molecule which is
capable of conferring, activating or enhancing expression of a nucleic acid in a cell. A
promoter can comprise one or more specific transcriptional regulatory sequences to further
enhance expression and/or to alter the spatial expression and/or temporal expression of
same. A promoter can also comprise distal enhancer or repressor elements, which can be
located as much as several thousand base pairs from the start site of transcription. A
promoter can be derived from sources including viral, bacterial, fungal, plants, insects, and
animals. A promoter can regulate the expression of a gene component constitutively, or
differentially with respect to cell, the tissue or organ in which expression occurs or, with
respect to the developmental stage at which expression occurs, or in response to external
stimuli such as physiological stresses, pathogens, metal ions, or inducing agents.
Representative examples of promoters include the bacteriophage T7 promoter,
bacteriophage T3 promoter, SP6 promoter, lac operator-promoter, tac promoter, SV40 late
promoter, SV40 early promoter, RSV-LTR promoter, CMV IE promoter, SV40 early
promoter or SV40 late promoter and the CMV IE promoter.
         o. Stringent Hybridization Conditions
         "Stringent hybridization conditions" as used herein means conditions under which a
first nucleic acid sequence (e.g., probe) will hybridize to a second nucleic acid sequence
(e.g., target), such as in a complex mixture of nucleic acids. Stringent conditions are
sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Stringent conditions
can be selected to be about 5-10 C lower than the thermal melting point (Tin) for the
specific sequence at a defined ionic strength pH. The Tm can be the temperature (under
defined ionic strength, pH, and nucleic concentration) at which 50% of the probes
complementary to the target hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium (as the target
sequences are present in excess, at Tm, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium).
Stringent conditions can be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M
sodium ion, such as about 0.01-1.0 M sodium ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to
8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30'C for short probes (e.g., about 10-50
                                                 -17-

nucleotides) and at least about 60'C for long probes (e.g., greater than about 50 nucleotides).
Stringent conditions can also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as
formamide. For selective or specific hybridization, a positive signal can be at least 2 to 10
times background hybridization. Exemplary stringent hybridization conditions include the
following: 50% formamide, 5x SSC, and 1% SDS, incubating at 42'C, or, 5x SSC, 1%
SDS, incubating at 65'C, with wash in 0.2x SSC, and 0.1% SDS at 65 0 C.

hybridize under stringent hybridization conditions.
        q. Substantially Identical
        "Substantially identical" as used herein means that a first and second sequence are at
least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical over a
region of 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 40 45, 50,

nucleotides or amino acids, or with respect to nucleic acids, if the first sequence is
substantially complementary to the complement of the second sequence.
        r. Subtype or Serotype
        "Subtype" or "serotype": as used herein, interchangeably, and in reference to
prostate cancer antigens, means genetic variants of a prostate cancer antigen such that one
subtype (or variant) is recognized by an immune system apart from a different subtype.
        s. Variant
        "Variant" used herein with respect to a nucleic acid means (i) a portion or fragment
of a referenced nucleotide sequence; (ii) the complement of a referenced nucleotide
sequence or portion thereof; (iii) a nucleic acid that is substantially identical to a referenced
nucleic acid or the complement thereof; or (iv) a nucleic acid that hybridizes under stringent
conditions to the referenced nucleic acid, complement thereof, or a sequences substantially
identical thereto.
                                                -18-

        "Variant" with respect to a peptide or polypeptide that differs in amino acid sequence
by the insertion, deletion, or conservative substitution of amino acids, but retain at least one
biological activity. Variant can also mean a protein with an amino acid sequence that is
substantially identical to a referenced protein with an amino acid sequence that retains at
least one biological activity. A conservative substitution of an amino acid, i.e., replacing an
amino acid with a different amino acid of similar properties (e.g., hydrophilicity, degree and
distribution of charged regions) is recognized in the art as typically involving a minor
change. These minor changes can be identified, in pal, by considering the hydropathic
index of amino acids, as understood in the art. Kyte et al., J. Mol. Biol. 157:105-132 (1982).
The hydropathic index of an amino acid is based on a consideration of its hydrophobicity
and charge. It is known in the art that amino acids of similar hydropathic indexes can be
substituted and still retains protein function. In one aspect, amino acids having hydropathic
indexes of 2 are substituted. The hydrophilicity of amino acids can also be used to reveal
substitutions that would result in proteins retaining biological function. A consideration of
the hydrophilicity of amino acids in the context of a peptide permits calculation of the
greatest local average hydrophilicity of that peptide, a useful measure that has been reported
to correlate well with antigenicity and immunogenicity. U.S. Patent No. 4,554,101,
incorporated fully herein by reference. Substitution of amino acids having similar
hydrophilicity values can result in peptides retaining biological activity, for example
immunogenicity, as is understood in the art. Substitutions can be performed with amino
acids having hydrophilicity values within 2 of each other. Both the hydrophobicity index
and the hydrophilicity value of amino acids are influenced by the particular side chain of
that amino acid. Consistent with that observation, amino acid substitutions that are
compatible with biological function are understood to depend on the relative similarity of
the amino acids, and particularly the side chains of those amino acids, as revealed by the
hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, charge, size, and other properties.
        t. Vector
        "Vector" as used herein means a nucleic acid sequence containing an origin of
replication. A vector can be a vector, bacteriophage, bacterial artificial chromosome or
yeast artificial chromosome. A vector can be a DNA or RNA vector. A vector can be a
self-replicating extrachromosomal vector, and preferably, is a DNA plasmid.

2. Consensus prostate antigens
        Provided herein are consensus antigens capable of eliciting an immune response in a
mammal against a prostate antigen. The consensus antigen can comprise epitopes that make
them particularly effective as immunogens against prostate cancer cells can be induced. The

3. Genetic Sequences, Constructs and Plasmids
         Nucleic acid molecules encoding the consensus amino acid sequences were
generated to optimize stability and expression in humans. Codon selection was determined

        b. Routes of Administration
        The vaccine can be administered by different routes including orally, parenterally,
sublingually, transdermally, rectally, transmucosally, topically, via inhalation, via buccal
administration, intrapleurally, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous,
intramuscular, intranasal intrathecal, and intraarticular or combinations thereof. For
veterinary use, the composition can be administered as a suitably acceptable formulation in
accordance with normal veterinary practice. The veterinarian can readily determine the
dosing regimen and route of administration that is most appropriate for a particular animal..
The vaccine can be administered by traditional syringes, needleless injection devices,
"nicroprojectile bombardment gone guns", or other physical methods such as
electroporation ("EP"), "hydrodynamic method", or ultrasound.
        The vector of the vaccine can be delivered to the mammal by several well known
technologies including DNA injection (also referred to as DNA vaccination) with and
without in vivo electroporation, liposome mediated, nanoparticle facilitated, recombinant
vectors such as recombinant adenovirus, recombinant adenovirus associated virus and
recombinant vaccinia. The prostate antigen can be delivered via DNA injection and along
with in vivo electroporation.
        c.  Electroporation
        Administration of the vaccine via electroporation of the plasmids of the vaccine may
be accomplished using electroporation devices that can be configured to deliver to a desired
tissue of a mammal a pulse of energy effective to cause reversible pores to form in cell
membranes, and in some embodiments, the pulse of energy is a constant current similar to a
preset current input by a user.
        In some embodiments where electroporation is utilized, the electroporation device
may comprise an electroporation component and an electrode assembly or handle assembly.
The electroporation component may include and incorporate one or more of the various
elements of the electroporation devices, including: controller, current waveform generator,
impedance tester, waveform logger, input element, status reporting element, communication
port, memory component, power source, and power switch. The electroporation may be
accomplished using an in vivo electroporation device, for example CELLECTRA@ EP
                                               -36-

system (Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Blue Bell, PA) or Elgen electroporator (Inovio
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Blue Bell, PA) to facilitate transfection of cells by the plasmid.
         The electroporation component may function as one element of the electroporation
devices, and the other elements are separate elements (or components) in communication
with the electroporation component. The electroporation component may function as more
than one element of the electroporation devices, which may be in communication with still
other elements of the electroporation devices separate from the electroporation component.
The elements of the electroporation devices existing as parts of one electromechanical or
mechanical device may not limited as the elements can function as one device or as separate
elements in communication with one another. The electroporation component may be
capable of delivering the pulse of energy that produces the constant current in the desired
tissue, and includes a feedback mechanism. The electrode assembly may include an
electrode array having a plurality of electrodes in a spatial arrangement, wherein the
electrode assembly receives the pulse of energy from the electroporation component and
delivers same to the desired tissue through the electrodes. At least one of the plurality of
electrodes is neutral during delivery of the pulse of energy and measures impedance in the
desired tissue and communicates the impedance to the electroporation component. The
feedback mechanism may receive the measured impedance and can adjust the pulse of
energy delivered by the electroporation component to maintain the constant current.
         A plurality of electrodes may deliver the pulse of energy in a decentralized pattern.
The plurality of electrodes may deliver the pulse of energy in the decentralized pattern
through the control of the electrodes under a programmed sequence, and the programmed
sequence is input by a user to the electroporation component. The programmed sequence
may comprise a plurality of pulses delivered in sequence, wherein each pulse of the plurality
of pulses is delivered by at least two active electrodes with one neutral electrode that
measures impedance, and wherein a subsequent pulse of the plurality of pulses is delivered
by a different one of at least two active electrodes with one neutral electrode that measures
impedance.
         The feedback mechanism may be performed by either hardware or software. The
feedback mechanism may be performed by an analog closed-loop circuit. The feedback
occurs every 50 ps, 20 ps, 10 p s or I ps, but is preferably a real-time feedback or
instantaneous (i.e., substantially instantaneous as determined by available techniques for
determining response time). The neutral electrode may measure the impedance in the desired
                                               -37-

tissue and communicates the impedance to the feedback mechanism, and the feedback
mechanism responds to the impedance and adjusts the pulse of energy to maintain the
constant current at a value similar to the preset current. The feedback mechanism may
maintain the constant current continuously and instantaneously during the delivery of the
pulse of energy.

        In vitro translation performed to confirm the expression of the PSA and PSMA
antigens. The TNT@ Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System and 35S-methionine
(Promega) were used. The pVAX vector alone (negative control) or pVAX backbone with
the PSA or PSMA antigen inserts and 35S-methionine was added to the reaction mixture
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was carried out at 30"C for 2
hours. Labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA Affinity Gel (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) by rotation overnight in radioimrunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer at 4'C.
The immunoprecipitated proteins were electrophoresed on a SDS-PAGE gel that was
subsequently fixed and dried. Expression of the 35S-labeled proteins was detected by
autoradiography. The results are shown in Figure 1.
                                          Example 9
         Cellular immunogenicity of the PSA and PSMA antigens was determined by
Interferon-gamma ELISpot.
         Female 4 to 6-week-old BALB/c mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories
(Bar Harbor, ME). All animals were housed in a temperature-controlled, light-cycled facility
at the University of Pennsylvania. Animal care was carried out according to the guidelines
of the National Institutes of Health and the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Care and
Use Committee.
         For cellular inmmunogenicity studies, 10 or 20 pg of each antigen was delivered to
the tibialis anterior muscle of Balb/c mice by intramuscular injection followed by
electroporation using the CELLECTRA@ adaptive constant current device (Inovio
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Blue Bell, PA). Mice (n=5 per group) received 2 immunizations at
                                              -45-

weeks 0 and 2. Two 0.1 Amp constant current square-wave pulses were delivered through a
triangular 3-electrode array consisting of 26-gauge solid stainless steel electrodes. Each
pulse was 52 milliseconds in length with a 1 second delay between pulses. The mice
received a total of 2 immunizations that were administered 2 weeks apart. Mice were
humanely sacrificed I week after the second immunization for analysis of cellular and
humoral immune responses.
        Cellular and responses were assessed 1 week after the last immunization (week 5).
ELISpot analysis was used to determine antigen-specific secretion of IFNy. Mouse IFNy
capture antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used to coat flat-bottom
Immobilon-P plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA) overnight at 4'C. Splenocytes were
aseptically isolated and resuspended at in RIO media (Rosewell Park Memorial Institute
medium 1640 with supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic
                                      5
and 0.1 % 2-mercaptoethanol). 2x10      splenocytes from immunized mice were added in to
each well of the 96-well plate and stimulated overnight at 37' C, 5% C02, in the presence of
RIO (negative control), concanavalin A (positive control) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or
antigen-specific peptide pools. The next day, mouse IFNy detection antibody (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added to the plates that were then incubated overnight at
4'C. The following day, streptavidin-ALP (MabTech, Sweden) was added to the plates for 2
hours and antigen-specific spots were visualized with BCIP/NPT substrate (MabTech,
Sweden). PSA and PSMA peptides were 15-mer peptides spanning the entire length of the
consensus immunogen, not including the HA tag or leader sequence, overlapping by 11
amino acids, and were synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). PSA and PSMA peptides
were used at a final concentration of 1.0 pg/mL for each peptide. IFNy ELISpot was used to
evaluate antigen-specific cellular responses I week after the last immunization. For PSA,
IFNy responses were similar for the 10 pg (772.2 +/- 138. 2 SFU) and 20 pg (771.1 +1
155.2 SFU) vaccine doses (Figure 2A). In contrast, there was a dose-dependant increase in
PSMA-specific FNy responses with 20 microgram of the vaccine (1585.0 +/- 194.0 SFU) as
compared to 10 pg of the vaccine (1047.2 +/- 160.7 SFU) (Figure 2B). Minimal background
was observed for PSA or PSMA responses in naive mice.
                                          Example 10
        Vaccine-induced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell production of IFNv,IL-2 and TNFa
                                              -46-

        Cellular immunogenicity was further characterized by flow cytometry for the co
delivery of the PSA and PSMA vaccines. Antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
production of IFNy, IL-2 and TNFa was determined for the total vaccine-specific response
and the PSA and PSMA components of the total vaccine-specific response (n=5).
        Cellular immune responses were also determined by intracellular cytokine staining
and flow cytometry using the CytoFix/CytoPerm kit per manufacteurer's instructions (BD
Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Splenocytes harvested from immunized mice were washed
with PBS and then resuspended in RIO media to a final concentration of 107 cells/ml. Cells
were seeded in 96-well round bottom plates in a volume of 10pl and an additional 100pl of
RIO media (negative control), media containing antigen-specific peptides pools or media
containing phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 10 ng/ml) and ionomycin (250 ng/ml; positive
control) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added and plates were incubated at 37'C, 5% C02, for
6 hours. All stimulation media contained 1 pg/pL each of GolgiPlug and GolgiStop (BD
Biosciences, San Diego, CA). At the end of the incubation period plates were spun down
and washed twice with PBS. Cells were then stained with a violet dye for viability
(LIVE/DEAD Violet Viability Dye, Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) for 30 minutes at 4'C. After
washing as above with PBS, cells were stained externally for 30 minutes with anti-CD4
PerCPCy5.5 and anti-CD8 APC at 4'C, followed by fixing and permeabilization. Anti-CD3
PE-Cy5, anti-IL-2 PE, anti-IFNy AlexaFluor-700 and anti-TNFa FITC (BD Biosciences,
San Diego, CA) were added and cells were incubated again at 4'C for 30 minutes. Cells
were given a final wash with PBS and fixed in 1% PFA.
        Co-delivery of the PSA and PSMA vaccine induced robust CD4+ secretion of IFNy,
IL-2 and TNFa. The percentage of PSA-specific (0.21%) and PSMA-specific (0.24%) IFNy
producing CD4+ T cells contributed equally to the total vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell IFNy
response (0.44%) (Figure 3A). PSMA-specific CD4+ T cells producing IL-2 (1.08%)
comprised the majority of the total percentage of CD4+ T cells producing vaccine-specific
IL-2 (1.40%) (Figure 3B). The percentage of PSA (0.31%) and PSMA (0.29%) induced
CD4+ T cell production of TNFa contributed equally to the total vaccine-specific response
(0.60%) (Figure 3C). Overall, CD4+ T cell responses were well balanced between PSA and
PSMA, with the exception of PSMA inducing the majority of the vaccine-specific CD4+ T
cell IL-2 production.
        The vaccine induced strong antigen-specific CD8+ T cell production of IFNy and IL
2 and, to a lesser extent, TNFa. Both PSA (0.70%) and PSMA (0.67%) induced robust
                                             -47-

CD8+ T cell IFNy production. In fact, vaccine-specific CD8+ T cells secreting of IFNy
comprised 1.37% of the total CD8+ T cell population (Figure 4A). The vaccine also induced
a strong CD8+ T cell IL-2 response (1.54%). Similar to the CD4+ T cell IL-2 response, the
percentage of PSMA-specific (1.06%) CD8+ T cells secreting IL-2 was approximately 2
fold higher than PSA-specific (0.47%) (Figure 4B). The total percentage of vaccine-specific
CD8+ T cell production of TNFa (0.11%) was in response to the PSA component of the
vaccine (Figure 4C). In summary, there was a high percentage of vaccine-specific CD8+ T
cells production of IFNy and IL-2. Similar to CD4+ T cell responses, IFNy production was
equally balanced between PSA and PSMA and the magnitude of the IL-2 PSMA-specific
response was greater than that of the PSA-specific response.
                                          Example 11
                               PSA-specific IgG Seroconversion
        Antibody response can play an important role in tumor immunotherapy.
Accordingly we next examined this parameter of the immune response to the PSA antigen
based on protein target availability.
        To determine PSA-specific sera antibody titers, 96-well Nunc-Immuno MaxiSorp
plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY) were coated overnight at 4'C with 1 pg/well of recombinant
PSA protein (Fitzgerald Industries, Acton, MA) diluted in PBS. Plates were washed with
PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with 10%
BSA/PBST, and incubated with serial dilutions of serum from immunized or naYve animals
for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were then washed 3 times with PBST and goat anti
mouse IgG (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) was added a dilution of 1:5,000 in PBST. Bound
enzyme was detected by SigmaFAST O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD; Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and the optical density was determined at 450 nm on a Biotek
(Winooski, VT) plate readeras shown in Figure 5B. Endpoint titers were determined as
previously described (Frey, A. et al. 1998). Briefly, the upper prediction limit was
calculated using the Student t-distribution. The mathematical formula that defines the upper
prediction limit is expressed as the standard deviation multiplied by a factor that was based
on the number of negative controls (n=5) and the confidence level (95%). The endpoint titer
was reported as the reciprocal of the last dilution above the upper predication limit.
                                               -48-

                In addition to conferring robust cellular-mediated immunity, the PSA vaccine
also induced strong antigen-specific humoral responses. Antibody titers were determined by
ELISA in sera isolated from mice one week after the last immunization (n=5). The vaccine
induced an average PSA-specific antibody endpoint titer of 4,427 (range 1581-15,811)
(Figure 5A). The longevity of these responses may be important as well.
