    WEB MATERIAL ADVANCEMENT ARRANGEMENT WITH AN ENTRY
                   DRIVE SYSTEM IN A PACKAGING MACHINE
                CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLCIATION
[00011         This application claims priority to U.S. Serial No. 62/417,577, filed
November 4, 2016.
                                    BACKGROUND
[00021     Web material advancement systems that feed web materials within product
processing    machines,  such   as packaging     machines,   are known. Web         material
advancement systems typically have exit drive systems that pull web material toward exit
ends of the web material advancement systems to feed web processing stations
downstream in the packaging machines. Such exit drive systems typically have a pair of
independent servo motors or other drive units on both of the left and right sides of the
exit end of the web material advancement systems. The servo motors are controlled to
provide synchronous operation of both motors to ensure the web material does not skew
as it is pulled from a downstream position to advance in the upstream-to-downstream
direction. However, these independent paired-drive exit drive systems are complex and
can   require   corresponding   complex    control  methodologies     for   synchronization
corrections in order to maintain coordinated driving of the left and right sides of the web
material advancement systems. Other exit drive systems have incorporated a single drive
shaft at the outlet end of the web advancement system that is positioned at a low
elevation to provide package clearance. These separate-shaft exit drive systems have
pairs of sprockets that are drive-coupled via chains to upper pairs of input sprockets to
impart movement to a pair of gripper chains with web grippers. However, the
independent chains of the chain-driven exit drive systems need maintenance and
inspection and can stretch or otherwise wear at different rates, which can lead to skewed
pulling of the web material toward the outlet end of the web advancement systems.
                                             I

                           SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[00031     According to one aspect of the invention, a web material advancement
arrangement is provided that has an entry drive system that is configured to push a web
material from storage on a roll toward a web processing station of a packaging machine.
[00041     According to another aspect of the invention, a web material advancement
arrangement with an entry drive system is provided. The web material advancement
arrangement can receive a web material from a storage roll and advance the web material
through a machine, such as a packaging machine. The web material advancement
arrangement may include an entry end that receives the web material from storage on the
roll and an exit end that delivers the web material from the web material advancement
arrangement downstream toward the rest of the packaging machine. An entry drive
system may be arranged at the entry end of the web material advancement arrangement
and is configured to push the web material in a downstream direction from the entry end
toward the exit end of the web material advancement arrangement.
[00051     According to another aspect of the invention, a pair of rotatable drive members
is arranged at the entry end of the web advancement arrangement. The web advancement
arrangement may define a pair of sides, and the pair of rotatable drive members may be
arranged in rotational unison with each other at the respective sides. The pair of rotatable
drive members may be defined by a pair of drive sprockets, and the entry drive system
may drive the pair of drive sprockets as a unit. The pair of drive sprockets may be
mounted to a drive roller at the entry end of the web material advancement arrangement.
The drive roller may lock the pair of drive sprockets into rotational unison with each
other.
[00061     According to another aspect of the invention, the drive roller defines a drive
roller axis of rotation, and the motor includes a motor output shaft that defines a motor
output shaft axis of rotation that is perpendicular to the drive roller axis rotation. A pair
of spaced-apart rails 12 may extend between the entry end and exit end of the web
                                              2

material advancement arrangement to support the web material and wherein the motor is
arranged generally parallel to the pair of spaced-apart rails.
[00071     According to another aspect of the invention, the input shaft may define an
input shaft outer portion that receives power from the motor and an opposite input shaft
inner portion. A first drive sprocket may be mounted to the input shaft inner portion to
lock the first drive sprocket and the input shaft into rotational unison with each other. The
drive roller may define first and second ends, with the first end mounted to the input shaft
inner portion to lock the drive roller and the input shaft into rotational unison with each
other. A support shaft may include a support shaft inner portion and a support shaft outer
portion. The support shaft inner portion is mounted to the second end of the drive roller
to lock support shaft and the drive roller in rotational unison with each other. A second
drive sprocket is mounted to the support shaft inner portion to lock the second drive
sprocket and the support shaft into rotational unison with each other. A power flow path
may be defined that transfers torque (i) from the input shaft inner portion to the first drive
sprocket and the first end of the drive roller, (ii) through the length of the drive roller, (iii)
from the second end of the drive roller to the support shaft inner portion, and (iv) from
the support shaft inner portion to the second drive sprocket.
[00081     According to another aspect of the invention, the entry drive system may
include a motor, which may be the sole prime mover for the entry drive system, and a
gearbox that receives power from the motor. The gearbox delivers power from the motor
to the pair of sprockets and the roller to push the web material in a downstream direction
from the entry end toward the exit end of the web material advancement arrangement.
The gearbox may directly drive an input shaft that is mounted to the drive roller.
[00091     According to another aspect of the invention, a web material advancement
arrangement is provided for advancing web material in a machine having an upstream
end and a downstream end, such as a packaging machine, and which includes an entry
drive system located at the upstream end of the machine. The web material advancement
arrangement includes a web material engagement arrangement, which may be in the form
of spaced-apart endless chains or belts equipped with web material gripper mechanisms
                                                3

that engage the web material adjacent opposite edges of the web material. The entry drive
system includes a pair of rotatable drive members, such as pulleys or sprockets which are
engaged with the web material engagement arrangement. A single motor includes a
rotatable output member that is drivingly engaged with the rotatable drive members.
Operation of the motor functions to impart rotation to the rotatable output member, which
in turn causes simultaneous rotation of the rotatable drive members and advancement of
the web material engagement arrangement and thereby advancement of the web material.

                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[00211      The present invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof
are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments described in
detail in the following description.
[00221      Referring generally to the drawings, a portion(s) of a machine that utilizes web
material, and that incorporates an entrance-end or entry drive system for advancing the
web material according to an embodiment of the invention, is illustrated in FIGS. 1-9.
Representatively, the machine may be a packaging machine in which web material is
supplied from storage on a roll and advanced through the machine. During such
advancement, components of the machine act on the web material to first deform the web
material to create a series of upwardly facing cavities, which are then filled with product
to be packaged. After placement of product into the cavities, the machine supplies a
second, top web that overlies the bottom web within which the cavities are formed.
Components of the machine then seal the top and bottom webs together about the cavities
so as to seal product within each cavity. The sealed webs are then separated
longitudinally and transversely to form individual product packages. A representative
type of packaging machine within which the entrance-end or entry drive system,
according to an embodiment of the invention, may be a form-fill-seal packaging machine
such as is available from CP Packaging LLC of Appleton, Wisconsin under its
                                              5

designation VisionPak. It is understood, however, that the entrance-end or entry drive
system according to an embodiment of the invention may be used in any type of
packaging machine that utilizes web material within which product cavities are formed
during advancement of the material through the machine. It is further understood that the
entrance-end or entry drive system, according to an embodiment of the invention, may be
used in applications other than packaging machines in which a flexible web material is
supplied from a roll and advanced through the machine for any purpose.
[00231     As shown in FIGS. 1-3, a web material advancement arrangement for moving
web material, shown at web W, through a machine is generally shown at 10. In a manner
as is known, the web W may be supplied from storage on a roll R that is rotatably
supported by the frame of the machine (not shown). In addition, the frame of the machine
supports a pair of spaced-apart rails 12 of the web material advancement arrangement 10,
which in turn supports a web material engagement arrangement. In a manner as is known,
the web material engagement arrangement may be in the form of spaced-apart endless
chains or belts, such as belts 14, that are equipped with web material gripper
mechanisms, such as clip assemblies 16, that engage the web W adjacent opposite edges
of the web W. Representatively, the web material engagement arrangement with belts 14
and clip assemblies 16 may be a clip belt-type web material engagement arrangement
such as is shown and described in Buchko et al. US patent 7,934,362 titled Belt Driven
Clamping Arrangement for Gripping and Advancing Web Material in a Packaging
Machine, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. It is understood,
however, that the web material engagement arrangement may have any other satisfactory
configuration and construction as desired, and which is capable of selectively engaging
web material adjacent its edges at an upstream end, advancing the web material, and then
releasing engagement of the web material at a downstream end. In the illustrated
embodiment, the clip assemblies 16 are arranged as a series of web-engaging clip
assemblies 16 that are secured to each belt 14 along the length of the belt 14. The
drawings illustrate only a few of the clip assemblies 16 in the vicinity of the upstream end
of the machine or entry end of the web material advancement arrangement, but it is
                                              6

understood that the clip assemblies 16 are secured along the entire length of each belt 14.
In a manner as is known, each clip assembly 16 is selectively opened at the upstream end
of the machine and then closed onto the web W so that the web W is engaged by each
clip assembly 16 adjacent the edge of the web W.
[00241     As also shown in FIG. 1, the web material advancement arrangement 10
further includes a drive system such as an entry drive system, shown generally at 20,
which is located at the upstream or entrance end of the machine that defines an entry end
of the web material advancement arrangement. The web material                 advancement
arrangement 10 acts on the web material engagement arrangement, namely belts 14 and
clip assemblies 16, for imparting upstream-to-downstream motion to the upper runs of
the belts 14 for advancing the web W through the machine.
[00251     The entry drive system 20 may define a direct drive system (FIGS. 1-8) or an
indirect drive system (FIG. 9), explained in greater detail elsewhere herein. Regardless of
whether the entry drive system 20 is configured as a direct or an indirect drive system, it
is configured to push the web W (FIGS. 1-3) in a downstream direction from the
upstream or entry end toward a downstream or exit end of the web material advancement
arrangement 10, from which the web W travels farther downstream in the machine for
processing.
[00261     Referring now to FIG. 1, generally, the drive system 20 includes a drive
assembly 22 that is supported by the frame of the machine (not shown). Drive assembly
22 is shown with a single electric motor 22a as a prime mover that can deliver power for
the entry drive system 20. Motor 22a is shown here generally parallel to the frame rail(s)
12 and delivers power to a gearbox 22b that may convert a rotational speed of a motor
output shaft (not labeled) to an appropriate speed for operating downstream components
within the power path of the entry drive system 20. Gearbox 22b is shown here with a 90
degree gearbox section 22c that may include a worm gear set or bevel gear set to change
the direction of power application from a motor output shaft 22d (FIG. 6). Gearbox 22b is
configured to directly deliver power from motor 22a to input shaft 30. Although gearbox
22b is shown with a 90-degree gearbox section 22c, it is understood that power
                                             7

transmission be achieved in other suitable ways, such as an inline gearbox or by way of a
direct coupling to a motor.
[00271     Referring now to FIGS. 1-3, a pair of rotatable drive members, shown here as
spaced-apart belt drive sprockets 32, is secured to the input shaft 30 and is configured to
engage the belt 14 and clip assemblies 16 for moving the belt 14 and clip assemblies 16
in an upstream-to-downstream direction in response to operation of the drive assembly
22. At the exit end of web material advancement arrangement 10, a pair of spaced-apart
idler sprockets may be connected to each other with an idler roller to support the web W.
Such idler sprockets may have configurations and constructions similar to drive sprockets
32 and may be supported by the frame of the machine at its downstream or exit end in
generally the same manner as the drive sprockets 32 are supported at the upstream or
entry end. In a manner as is known, the belts 14, with clip assemblies 16, are carried
about the idler sprockets to provide the continuous loop forming the upper and lower runs
of the belts 14.
[00281     FIGS. 4-6 illustrate a direct drive system version of the drive system 20
separate from the machine and the web W. In the view provided in FIG. 4, it can be
appreciated that each drive sprocket 32 includes a series of spaced recesses 34 about its
outer periphery, each of which is configured to receive one of the clip assemblies 16. The
belt 14 is engaged by the areas of each sprocket 32 on either side of each recess 34.
Referring again to FIGS. 4-6, as can also be appreciated, the input shaft 30 is secured to a
drive roller shown as roller 36 that is located between the sprockets 32. Sprockets 32 are
mounted to ends of drive roller 36, with drive roller 36 defining a common shaft that
locks the drive sprockets 32 into rotational unison with each other as driven by input
shaft 30. The drive roller 36 is configured to support the web W between the edges of the
web W that are engaged by the clip assemblies 16 at the upstream end of the machine or
entry end of the web material advancement arrangement 10 and defines drive roller axis
of rotation, indicated by the dashed line 38 (FIG. 1). The drive roller axis of rotation 38 is
perpendicular to a motor axis of rotation, indicated by the dashed line 40 (FIG. 1).
                                              8

[00291     Referring now to FIGS. 6-7, a squeeze collar 46 may provide a force on a bore
of the gearbox and the input shaft 30 may define an input shaft inner portion 48 that is
shown here supported by bearing assembly 50, which may be a pillow block bearing or
other suitable bearing. It is understood that the squeeze collar 46 and/or torque
transmitting components that deliver power to drive sprocket 32 may have other
configurations, such as a resilient or other coupling(s) to accommodate misalignment of,
for example, rotating components in driving and driven relationship with each other.
Regardless, drive sprocket 32, which is closest to drive assembly 22, defines a first drive
sprocket 32a that is mounted to the input shaft inner portion 48 to lock the first drive
sprocket 32a and the input shaft 30 into rotational unison with each other. The drive roller
36 defines first and second ends 52, 54 with the first end 52 mounted to the input shaft
inner portion 48 to lock the drive roller 36 and the input shaft 30 into rotational unison
with each other. A support shaft 60 extends from and supports the second end 54 of drive
roller 36. Support shaft 60 includes support shaft inner and outer portions 62, 64. The
support shaft inner portion 62 is mounted to the drive roller's second end 54 to lock the
support shaft 60 and the drive roller 36 in rotational unison with each other. Drive
sprocket 32, which is farthest from drive assembly 22, defines a second drive sprocket
32b that is mounted to the support shaft inner portion 62 to lock the second drive sprocket
32b and support shaft 60 into rotational unison with each other. Support shaft outer
portion 64 is supported by another bearing assembly 50.
[00301     Referring now to FIG. 8, a power flow path is schematically shown through
drive system 20 components as represented with heavy-line arrows. The power flow path
corresponds to torque transmission through the various components for pushing web
material W (FIG. 1) in a downstream direction toward the exit end of web material
advancement arrangement 10. Input shaft 30 receives torque or power at its input shaft
inner portion 48 from motor 22a through gearbox 22b. The power is transmitted through
input shaft 30 to its input shaft inner portion 48. At the input shaft inner portion 48,
power is transmitted to the first drive sprocket 32a through a key 66 with a keyway fit
and to the drive roller first end 52 through a flange 68 and fasteners 70 that secure the
                                              9

flange 68 against a shoulder or land within a counterbore of the drive roller first end 52.
Power is transmitted through the drive roller 36 to its second end 54. At the drive roller
second end 54, power is transmitted through flange 68 of the support shaft inner portion
62 and fasteners 70 that secure the flange 68 against a shoulder or land within a
counterbore of the drive roller second end 54. At the support shaft inner portion 62,
power is transmitted to the second drive sprocket 32b through a key 66 with a keyway fit.
This results in unit-like simultaneous rotation of the first and second drive sprockets32a,
32b through a single power input of input shaft 30 from a single motor 22a to push the
web material W (FIG. 1) in a downstream direction toward the exit end of web material
advancement arrangement 10.
[00311     FIG. 9 illustrate an indirect drive system version of the drive system 20,
showing the drive system 20 separate from the machine and the web W. This indirect
drive system 20 of FIG. 9 is substantially similar to the direct drive system 20, shown in a
similar view in FIG. 4, only differing in that the drive system 20 does not directly drive
input shaft 30, but instead uses discrete spaced apart intervening components between
gearbox 22b and input shaft 30. As shown in FIG. 9, gearbox 22b delivers power to a
drive member, shown as drive pulley 72, which is driven during operation of the drive
assembly 22. A driven member, shown as driven pulley 74, is rotated by a flexible drive
member such as belt 76 that drivingly engages drive pulley 72 and driven pulley 74.
Although in the illustrated embodiment the drive and driven members are in the form of
drive and driven pulleys 72, 74 and the flexible drive member is in the form of belt 76, it
is understood that any other type of drive system, such as but not limited to a sprocket
and-chain system, may be employed.
[00321     In operation, the web W is advanced in an upstream-to-downstream direction
by operation of the single motor drive assembly 22, which imparts rotation to the input
shaft 30 and thereby to the sprockets 32. In the direct drive system versions of entry drive
system 20, like that shown in FIG. 1, motor 22a and gearbox 22b directly rotate the input
shaft 30, which rotates the drive sprocket 32 nearest the gearbox 22b, the drive roller 36,
and the drive sprocket 32 farthest from the gearbox 22b as a unit. In the indirect drive
                                              10

system versions of entry drive system 20, like that shown in FIG. 9, motor 22a and
gearbox 22b rotate the drive pulley 72 which rotates the driven pulley 74 through belt 76.
Rotation of pulley 74 rotates input shaft 30 and the drive sprocket 32 that is mounted to
an end of input shaft 30 that is closest to the drive assembly 22, which also rotates the
drive roller 36 and the drive sprocket 32 that is mounted farthest from the drive assembly
22. In this way, in both direct and indirect drive system versions of entry drive system 20,
activating the entry drive system 20 pushes the web W in the upstream-to-downstream
direction by rotation of the drive sprockets 32 at the entry end of web material
advancement arrangement 10 that pushes and advances the belts 14 and clip assemblies
16 that carry the web W.
[00331      It should be understood that the above           description, while indicating
representative embodiments of the present invention, is given by way of illustration and
not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the
present invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the invention includes all
such modifications.
[00341      Various additions, modifications, and rearrangements are contemplated as
being within the scope of the following claims, which particularly point out and distinctly
claim the subject matter regarding as the invention, and it is intended that the following
claims cover all such additions, modifications, and rearrangements.
