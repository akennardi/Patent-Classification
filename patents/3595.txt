           Production device and Production Method of High-purity And High-density Lithium
                               Borate for X-ray Fluorescence Analysis
                                   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]     The present invention relates to the preparation of flux for X-ray fluorescence analysis,
 and more particularly, to a production device and production method of high-purity and
 high-density lithium borate for X-ray fluorescence analysis.
                                          BACKGROUND
[0002]     With the development of the X-ray fluorescence            spectroscopy (XRF) analysis
 technology, the technology for preparing samples by borates fusion has been widely used in the
 cement, ceramics and smelting industries owing to fast speed and high accuracy. The commonly
 used borates are mainly borates of alkali metal, such as lithium, sodium. However, the fuse
 pieces prepared from the borate of sodium has the disadvantages that he fuse pieces is easy to
 absorb moisture, the sodium in the sample is unable to be analyzed, and the absorption of X-ray
 is larger than that of the lithium-containing flux. At present, the borate of sodium is basically
 replaced with the borate of lithium, such as lithium tetraborate, lithium tetraborate and their
 mixture at certain ratio.
[0003]     The small lithium atoms in the borate system of lithium are unable to be detected by
 X-rays, and thus do not interfere with the fluorescence lines of the analytical elements. Lithium
 tetraborate of the borate of lithium is a weakly acidic flux, which is able to be melted with
 alkaline samples, and the lithium metaborate is an alkaline flux, which is able to be melted with
 acidic samples. The samples of the cement and steel industries often contain acidic oxides and
 alkaline oxides, and the complete melting effect of oxide in samples is unable to be achieved
 only by the lithium tetraborate or the lithium metaborate alone. The acid-base properties of
 different oxides in samples are able to be effectively neutralized by the mixed flux prepared by
 mixing lithium tetraborate and lithium metaborate at different ratios at high temperature, so that
 the samples are melted to even molecular state, thus obtaining stable and uniform fusing glass
 pieces for the purpose of testing.
[0004]     Lithium borate fusion technology has the advantages of uniform sample preparation,
 high analysis accuracy, short cycle and low analysis cost, and is thus widely used by domestic
 and foreign analytical laboratories. With the improvement of the analysis automation level, the

                                                   2
 current foreign sample fusing process is of automatic operation, automatic sample weighing and
 automatic feeding, which puts forward high requirements for the particle uniformity and mobility
 of flux for X-ray fluorescence analysis. At present, the production method of high-density
 lithium borate flux for X-ray fluorescence analysis is the high-temperature fusion method which
 mainly comprises taking lithium tetraborate, lithium metaborate or lithium carbonate and boric
 acid as raw materials, and melting, quenching, crushing and screening such materials at high
 temperature to prepare a lithium borate flux. The chemical indicators of the product prepared by
 such method depend on the purity of raw materials and the used apparatus. If high-purity raw
 materials and platinum apparatus are used, it is easy to produce high-purity product with
 apparent density t 1.0g/cm 3 . At present, most of the foreign lithium borate fluxes for X-ray
 fluorescence analysis are produced by such method.
[0005]     The method as disclosed in Chinese patent CN102838125A comprises the following
 steps: purifying industrial-grade lithium hydroxide and industrial-grade boric acid, and
 neutralizing the purified lithium hydroxide and the boric acid at certain ration; concentrating the
 resulting reaction solution to a whitish state, and then pouring the solution into a stainless steel
 disc for evaporation, crushing and secondary drying to obtain lithium tetraborate powder;
 melting the powder at 930 to 950'C for 4 to 5 hours, water quenching, cold cutting and drying
 the powder to obtain high-density lithium borate crystals. The process is complex and has small
 mass production capacity. Most importantly, all impurities in the raw materials for the process
 route will remain in the product, so that the product purity is difficult to achieve the requirements
 for reagents for X-ray fluorescence analysis.

[0022]     Actually, the present invention is characterized by preparing high-density lithium borate
 beads directly based on the prepared lithium borate (e.g. lithium tetraborate, lithium metaborate
 or a mixture of lithium tetraborate and lithium metaborate at certain ratio) or a mixture of
 solid-phase reacting boric acid and lithium carbonate at stoichiometric ratio at 200 to 300'C for 3
 to 5 hours, thus making the beads suitable for X-ray fluorescence analysis. The lithium borate
 which has been prepared is capable of being obtained by the method in the prior art. For example,
 lithium borate is capable of being prepared by the method disclosed in CN104016358B, and the
 present invention is not limited thereto.
[0023]     The structure and principle of the production device of high-purity and high-density
 lithium borate for X-ray fluorescence analysis of the present invention are detailed as follows:
[0024]     Figure 1 is a structural diagram of a production device of high-purity and high-density
 lithium borate for X-ray fluorescence analysis according to one exemplary embodiment of the
 present invention, Figure 2 is a structural diagram of a melting unit in a production device of
 high-purity and high-density lithium borate for X-ray fluorescence analysis according to one
 exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and Figure 3 is a structural diagram of an
 atomization unit in a production device of high-purity and high-density lithium borate for X-ray
 fluorescence analysis according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
[0025]     As shown in Figure 1, the production device of high-purity and high-density lithium
 borate for X-ray fluorescence analysis comprises a feeding unit 10, a melting unit 20, an
 atomization unit 30, a collection unit 50 and an atomizer collection tower 40 according to one
 exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The feeding unit 10 is used for storing and
 transporting raw material, the melting unit 20 is used for melting the raw material to obtain
 molten melt, the atomization unit 30 is used for atomizing the melt to obtain spherical lithium
 borate bead, the collection unit 50 is used for collecting the prepared high-density lithium borate,
 and the atomizer collection tower 40 is used for forming a confined space for atomization and

                                                  7
 collection.
[0026]     Specifically, the feeding unit 10 comprises a storage vessel 11 and a charger 12 in
 mutual communication, and the charger 12 is capable of feeding the raw material stored in the
 storage vessel 11 for a short period of time or for a long period of time to the melting unit 20.
 Preferably, the feeding unit further comprises an automatic charging control system (not shown),
 which is capable of automatically controlling charging by the height of the melt in the crucible
 21. For example, an infrared range finder or a radar range finder is used to measure the height of
 the melt in the crucible.
[0027]     As shown in Figure 2, the melting unit 20 comprises an electric heating furnace 22 with
 several heating elements 23 and a crucible 21 arranged in the electric heating furnace 22, and the
 bottom of the crucible 21 is connected with a discharge pipe 24, and the multiple heating
 elements 23 are arranged around the crucible 21 and the discharge pipe 24, wherein a discharge
 port of the charger 12 is arranged above a feed inlet of the crucible 21 or directly connected with
 a feed inlet of the crucible 21. As the lithium borate melt at high temperatures will erode other
 materials except platinum, the parts in contact with the melt in the melting unit is made of Pt-Au
 alloy   materials so as to ensure the quality of the product, and the crucible 21 is preferably a
 Pt-Au alloy crucible. In addition, the heating elements 23 are preferably silicon- carbide rods or
 silicon-molybdenum rods to reach the heating temperature higher than 1200'C.
[0028]     As shown in Figures 1 and 3, the atomization unit 30 and the collection unit 50 are
 arranged in the atomizer collection tower 40 to form a closed atomization and collection space.
 The atomization unit 30 comprises a centrifugal atomizing disk 31, a centrifugal atomizing disk
 mounting shaft 32, an electromagnetic induction heater 33 and a high-speed motor 35. The
 centrifugal atomizing disk 31 is mounted at the top of the centrifugal atomizing disk mounting
 shaft 32, for example, the centrifugal atomizing disk 31 is fixed to the top of the centrifugal
 atomizing disk mounting shaft 32 by means of riveting. The centrifugal atomizing disk mounting
 shaft 32 is connected with the high-speed motor 35 (by means of a motor shaft 34), so that the
 centrifugal atomizing disk mounting shaft 32 is driven by the high-speed motor 35 and the motor
 shaft 34 to rotate at high speed, and drives the centrifugal atomizing disk 31 to rotate at high
 speed. The electromagnetic induction heater 33 is arranged on and around the centrifugal
 atomizing disk mounting shaft 32 and set close to the centrifugal atomizing disk 31, thus keeping
 the centrifugal atomizing disk 31 at certain temperature and ensuring the processing effect. A
 discharge port of the discharge pipe 24 of the melting unit 20 is also arranged in the atomizer

                                                    8
 collection tower 40 and located above the centrifugal atomizing disk 31, so that the melt is able
 to accurately and controllably fall onto the upper surface of the centrifugal atomizing disk 31 and
 be atomizated.
[0029]     Similarly, as the lithium borate is flux and the lithium borate melt at high temperatures
 will erode other materials except platinum, the parts in contact with the melt in the melting unit
 is preferably made of Pt-Au alloy materials so as to ensure the quality of the product. However,
 if the entire rotating shaft is made of Pt-Au alloy    material, the cost is high and the mechanical
 properties of the material in the electromagnetic induction heating process fail to meet the
 requirements (the major reason), so the present invention chooses superalloy as the material of
 the rotating shaft, and a centrifugal atomizing disk made of Pt-Au alloy materials is mounted on
 the rotating shaft, which effectively solves the problem above. Specifically, the centrifugal
 atomizing disk 31 is preferably Pt-Au alloy centrifugal atomizing disk, and the centrifugal
 atomizing disk mounting shaft 32 is preferably superalloy centrifugal atomizing disk mounting
 shaft.
[0030]     In order to ensure the stability of the atomization unit, the atomization unit 30 further
 comprises a support 36 arranged on the high-speed motor 35 and a motor protection cover 37
 accommodating the high-speed motor 35 and the support 36, and the centrifugal atomizing disk
 mounting shaft 32 is arranged in a center hole of the support 36 and rotatably connected with the
 support 36 through a bearing 38. The major role of the support 36 is to stabilize the centrifugal
 atomizing disc mounting shaft 32 and limit its shaking during high-speed operation. The
 centrifugal atomizing disk mounting shaft 32 is connected with the motor shaft 34 by means of a
 keyway and drives the centrifugal atomizing disk 31 to rotate while the motor shaft is rotating,
 thereby stabilizing the high-speed rotation of the centrifugal atomizing disk 31 and ensuring the
 quality of the final product.
[0031]     The collection unit 50 comprises a funnel-shaped material collector 51 and a collection
 vessel 52, the funnel-shaped material collector 51 is arranged below the atomization unit 30, and
 the collection vessel 52 is arranged below a discharge port of the funnel-shaped material
 collector 51. The funnel-shaped material collector 51 may be arranged integrally with the
 atomizer collection tower 40, or may be arranged separately in the atomizer collection tower 40.
 As shown in Figure 1, the feed inlet at the upper end of the funnel-shaped material collector 51 is
 relatively large and the discharge port at the lower end thereof is relatively small, so that the
 funnel-shaped material collector 51 is capable of effectively collecting the lithium borate beads

                                                   9
 dripped from the centrifugal atomizing disk 31 into the collection vessel 52 below the
 funnel-shaped material collector 51. In addition, the collection unit 50 may also comprise a
 hydraulic elevator platform 60 for holding the collection vessel 52, which is convenient to adjust
 the height position of the collection vessel 52.
[0032]    According to the present invention, in order to realize automatic production, the
 production device of the present invention may further comprise a control system to control the
 operation of the entire production device, the control system may be of the conventional control
 system in the art, and the present invention has no related limit.
[0033]    Meanwhile, the present invention provides a production method of high-purity and
 high-density lithium borate for X-ray fluorescence analysis. Specifically, the production device
 of high-purity and high-density lithium borate for X-ray fluorescence analysis is used in the
 method to produce high-purity and high-density lithium borate for X-ray fluorescence analysis.
[0034]    According to the exemplary example of the present invention, the production method
 comprises the following steps:
[0035]    Firstly, feeding raw material stored in a feeding unit 10 into a crucible 21 of a melting
 unit 20. The raw material used in the present invention is high-purity hydrous lithium borate
 (99.99%), high-purity anhydrous lithium borate (99.99%) or a mixture of high-purity boric acid
 (99.99%) and high-purity lithium carbonate (99.99%), which ensures a high purity of the final
 product. Specifically, the high-purity hydrous lithium borate or high-purity anhydrous lithium
 borate may be lithium tetraborate, lithium metaborate or a mixture of lithium tetraborate and
 lithium metaborate at different ratios.
[0036]    Secondly, heating the raw material in the crucible 21 to 1200-1350'C by an electric
 heating furnace 22 to obtain a melt.
[0037]    Thirdly, discharging the melt through a discharge pipe 24 to the surface of a centrifugal
 atomizing disk 31 rotating at 5000 to 30000rmp in an atomization unit 30 for atomization. To
 ensure the atomization quality, the electromagnetic induction heater 32 is used to control the
 surface temperature of the centrifugal atomizing disk 31 to 800-900'C. Controlling the surface
 temperature of the centrifugal atomizing disk 31 during the atomization is mainly to control the
 cooling rate of the lithium borate melt, to ensure the viscosity and mobility of the melt and to

                                                   10
 increase the atomization spherical rate. If the temperature is low and melt's viscosity is high, it is
 easy to form filaments in the atomization process.
[0038]     Lastly, cooling and collecting the atomized melt droplets thrown off from the
 centrifugal atomizing disk 31 in an atomizer collection tower 40 and a collection unit 50 to
 obtain the high-purity and high-density lithium borate for X-ray fluorescence analysis. Purity of
 the high-purity and high-density lithium borate for X-ray fluorescence analysis prepared in the
 present invention is higher than 99.99%, density thereof is 1.2-1.4g/cm 3 , and particle size
 thereof is 200-600pm.
[0039]     It should be understood that the embodiments detailed above and the following
 examples are used to describe the present invention but not limit the scope of the present
 invention. Some nonessential improvement and adjustment made by those skilled in the art
 according to the above-mentioned contents in the present invention belong to the protection

 20; heating the raw material in the crucible 21 to 1300'C by an electric heating furnace 22 to
 obtain lithium tetraborate melt; discharging the molten melt through a discharge pipe 24 to the
 surface of a centrifugal atomizing disk 31 rotating at 100OOrmp in an atomization unit 30 for
 centrifugal atomization; controlling the surface temperature of the centrifugal atomizing disk 31
 to 900'C by an electromagnetic induction heater 32; and cooling the atomized melt droplets
 thrown off from the centrifugal atomizing disk in the atomizer collection tower 40, and
 converging it through a funnel-shaped material collector 51, then feeding it into the collection
 vessel 52 for further cooling to obtain high-purity and high-density lithium borate for X-ray
 fluorescence analysis. The purity of the high-density lithium tetraborate obtained in the example
