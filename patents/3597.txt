DESCRIPTION
Title of Invention
          DELAMINATABLE CONTAINER
Technical Field
[0001]
          The present invention relates to a delaminatable container having an
inner layer delaminated from an outer layer and shrunk with a decrease in the
contents.
Cross-reference to related applications
[0001A]
          The present application is a divisional application of Australian Patent
Application No. 2014355546, which is a national phase application from
International Application No. PCT/JP2014/080735, having an application date of
20 November 2014, and claiming priority of Japanese Patent Application No.
2013-245374 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2013-245358. The full
disclosure of these applications is incorporated herein by reference.
Background Art
[0002]
          Conventionally, delaminatable containers are known that inhibit entrance
of air inside the container by an inner layer delaminated from an outer layer and
shrunk with a decrease in the contents (e.g., PTLs 1 and 2). Such delaminatable
container is provided with an inner bag composed of the inner layer and an outer
shell composed of the outer layer.
[0003]
          A container body of such delaminatable container is generally
manufactured by blow molding using a cylindrical laminated parison. The
container body has a bottom equipped with a sealing portion when an end of the
laminated parison is welded. Since the sealing portion is not resistant to impact,
it is provided to protrude from a bottom surface of the container to increase the
strength. In PTL 1, to increase the strength of the sealing portion even more,
welded layers in the sealing portion are welded to be engaged with each other by a
plurality of penetration portions.

Summary of Invention
Technical Problem
[0005]
(First Aspect)
          To achieve the composition of PTL 1, a die has to be provided with a pin to
press the parison welding layer, resulting in a complex die structure, which
increases production costs. It is therefore desired to reinforce the sealing portion
with simpler configuration.
[0006]
          A first aspect of the present invention has been made in view of such
                                            1

circumstances, and it is to provide a delaminatable container excellent in
productivity.
[0007]
(Second Aspect)
         A delaminatable container is normally used with a cap mounted in a
mouth. To prevent leakage of the contents from a gap between the cap and the
mouth, a cap provided with an inner ring that closely adheres to an inner surface
of the mouth is used.
[0008]
         When the present inventors repeatedly performed an experiment of
mounting a cap to a delaminatable container, it is found that the inner ring is
caught on the inner layer of the mouth to bend the inner layer, and in the worst
case, the inner layer sometimes delaminates completely from the outer layer in the
mouth, causing the inner bag to fall out in the outer shell.
[0009]
         A second aspect of the present invention has been made in view of such
circumstances, and it is to provide a delaminatable container that inhibits inner
layer delamination in a mouth of the delaminatable container.
Solution to Problem
[0010]
(First Aspect)
         According to the first aspect of the present invention, a delaminatable
container is provided that includes: a container body having an outer shell and an
inner bag, the inner bag delaminating from the outer shell and being shrunk with
a decrease in contents, wherein
         the container body includes a bottom seal protrusion protruding from a
bottom surface of a storage portion to store the contents, and
         the bottom seal protrusion is a sealing portion of, in blow molding using a
cylindrical laminated parison provided with an outer layer constituting the outer
shell and an inner layer constituting the inner bag, the laminated parison and is
bent.
[0011]
         Based on intensive examinations, the present inventors found that a
sealing portion is reinforced by a simple configuration of bending a bottom seal
protrusion protruding from a bottom surface of a storage portion of a container
body and thus have come to complete the present invention.
[0012]
         Various embodiments in the first aspect of the present invention are
exemplified below. The embodiments described below may be combined with each
other.
         It is preferred that the bottom seal protrusion includes, in order from a
side of the bottom surface, a thinner portion and a thicker portion having a
thickness greater than that of the thinner portion.
         It is preferred that the bottom seal protrusion is bent in the thinner
portion.
         It is preferred that the bottom surface includes a concave region and a
peripheral region provided surrounding the concave region, and the bottom seal
protrusion is provided in the concave region.
         It is preferred that the bottom seal protrusion is configured not to
protrude from a plane defined by the peripheral region in a state of being bent.
         It is preferred that the concave region is provided across the entire bottom
surface in a longitudinal direction of the bottom seal protrusion.
                                            2

[0013]
         According to another aspect, the present invention is a method of
manufacturing the above delaminatable container, and it is to provide a method of
manufacturing the delaminatable container, that includes bending the bottom
seal protrusion by softening by blowing hot air after blow molding.
[0014]
(Second Aspect)
         According to the second aspect of the present invention, a delaminatable
container is provided that includes a container body provided with a storage
portion to store contents and a mouth to deliver the contents from the storage
portion, the storage portion and the mouth having an outer layer and an inner
layer, the inner layer delaminating from the outer layer and being shrunk with a
decrease in the contents, wherein
         the mouth includes an enlarged diameter portion provided at an end of
the mouth and an inner layer support portion provided in a position closer to the
storage portion than the enlarged diameter portion and inhibiting slip down of the
inner layer.
[0015]
         According to intensive review by the present inventors, it is found that a
conventional delaminatable container has a mouth in an approximately cylindrical
shape, and when the mouth has an inner diameter smaller than the outer
diameter of the inner ring due to variations in manufacturing and the like, the end
of the inner ring sometimes enters between the inner layer and the outer layer at
the end of the mouth. Based on such finding, they have come up with the idea of
providing an enlarged diameter portion in the end of the mouth and actually
produced a delaminatable container having such configuration. The entrance of
the inner ring between the inner layer and the outer layer is inhibited and inner
layer delamination in the mouth of the delaminatable container is inhibited.
[0016]
         Although this method prevents the phenomenon that the inner bag falls
out in the outer shell, a phenomenon possibly occurs that the inner layer
delaminates due to friction between the inner layer and the inner ring and the
inner bag falls out in the outer shell. To prevent such phenomenon more
securely, as a result of further review, they have come up with the idea of
providing an inner layer support portion to inhibit slip down of the inner layer in a
position closer to the body side than the enlarged diameter portion and thus have
come to complete the present invention.
[0017]
         Various embodiments in the second aspect of the present invention are
exemplified below. The embodiments described below may be combined with each
other.
         It is preferred that the storage portion includes a main portion having an
approximately constant cross-sectional shape in longitudinal directions of the
storage portion and a shoulder portion linking the main portion to the mouth, the
shoulder portion or a boundary between the shoulder portion and the main
portion includes a bent portion, and the bent portion has a bending angle of 140
degrees or less and has a radius of curvature of 4 mm or less on a side of a
container inner surface in the bent portion.
         It is preferred that the bending angle is 120 degrees or less.
         It is preferred that the radius of curvature is 2 mm or less.
         It is preferred that the bent portion is provided in a position where a
distance from a container center axis to the container inner surface in the bent
portion is 1.3 times or more of a distance from the container center axis to the
                                            3

container inner surface in the mouth.
          It is preferred that the mouth has a thickness from 0.45 to 0.50 mm, the
bent portion has a thickness from 0.25 to 0.30 mm, and the main portion has a
thickness from 0.15 to 0.20 mm.

Description of Embodiments
[0020]
          Embodiments of the present invention are described below. Various
characteristics in the embodiments described below may be combined with each
other. Each characteristic is independently inventive.
[0021]
 1. First Embodiment
          As illustrated in Figs. 1 through 2, a delaminatable container 1 in the first
embodiment of the present invention is provided with a container body 3 and a
valve member 5. The container body 3 is provided with a storage portion 7 to
store the contents and a mouth 9 to deliver the contents from the storage portion
7.
[0022]
          As illustrated in Fig. 3, the container body 3 is provided with an outer
layer 11 and an inner layer 13 in the storage portion 7 and the mouth 9. An outer
shell 12 is composed of the outer layer 11 and an inner bag 14 is composed of the
inner layer 13. Due to delamination of the inner layer 13 from the outer layer 11
with a decrease in the contents, the inner bag 14 delaminates from the outer shell
 12 to be shrunk.
[0023]
          As illustrated in Fig. 4, the mouth 9 is equipped with external threads 9d.
To the external threads 9d, a cap, a pump, or the like having internal threads is
mounted. Fig. 4 partially illustrates a cap 23 having an inner ring 25. The inner
ring 25 has an outer diameter approximately same as an inner diameter of the
mouth 9. An outer surface of the inner ring 25 abuts on an abutment surface 9a
of the mouth 9, thereby preventing leakage of the contents. In the present
embodiment, the mouth 9 is equipped with an enlarged diameter portion 9b at the
end. The enlarged diameter portion 9b has an inner diameter greater than the
inner diameter in an abutment portion 9e, and thus the outer surface of the inner
ring 25 does not make contact with the enlarged diameter portion 9b. When the
mouth 9 does not have the enlarged diameter portion 9b, a defect sometimes
occurs in which the inner ring 25 enters between the outer layer 11 and the inner
layer 13 in the case where the mouth 9 has an even slightly smaller inner
diameter due to variations in manufacturing. In contrast, when the mouth 9 has
the enlarged diameter portion 9b, such defect does not occur even in the case
                                              5

where the mouth 9 has a slightly varied inner diameter.
[0024]
          The mouth 9 is also provided with an inner layer support portion 9c to
inhibit slip down of the inner layer 13 in a position closer to the storage portion 7
than the abutment portion 9e. The inner layer support portion 9c is formed by
providing a narrow part in the mouth 9. Even when the mouth 9 is equipped with
the enlarged diameter portion 9b, the inner layer 13 sometimes delaminates from
the outer layer 11 due to friction between the inner ring 25 and the inner layer 13.
In the present embodiment, even in such case, the inner layer support portion 9c
inhibits slip down of the inner layer 13, and thus it is possible to inhibit falling
out of the inner bag 14 in the outer shell 12.
[0025]
          As illustrated in Figs. 3 through 5, the storage portion 7 is provided with a
main portion 19 having an approximately constant cross-sectional shape in
longitudinal directions of the storage portion and a shoulder portion 17 linking the
main portion 19 to the mouth 9. The shoulder portion 17 is equipped with a bent
portion 22. The bent portion 22 is an area with a bending angle a illustrated in
Fig. 3 of 140 degrees or less and having a radius of curvature on a container inner
surface side of 4 mm or less. Without the bent portion 22, the delamination
between the inner layer 13 and the outer layer 11 sometimes extends from the
main portion 19 to the mouth 9 to delaminate the inner layer 13 from the outer
layer 11 even in the mouth 9. The delamination of the inner layer 13 from the
outer layer 11 in the mouth 9 is, however, undesirable because the delamination
of the inner layer 13 from the outer layer 11 in the mouth 9 causes falling out of
the inner bag 14 in the outer shell 12. Since the bent portion 22 is provided in
the present embodiment, even when delamination between the inner layer 13 and
the outer layer 11 extends from the main portion 19 to the bent portion 22, the
inner layer 13 is bent at the bent portion 22 as illustrated in Fig. 5 and the force
to delaminate the inner layer 13 from the outer layer 11 is not transmitted to the
area above the bent portion 22. As a result, the delamination between the inner
layer 13 and the outer layer 11 in the area above the bent portion 22 is inhibited.
Although, in Figs. 3 through 5, the bent portion 22 is provided in the shoulder
portion 17, the bent portion 22 may be provided at the boundary between the
shoulder portion 17 and the main portion 19.
[0026]
          Although the lower limit of bending angle a is not particularly defined, it
is preferably 90 degrees or more for ease of manufacture. Although the lower limit
of the radius of curvature is not particularly defined, it is preferably 0.2 mm or
more for ease of manufacture. In order to prevent delamination of the inner layer
 13 from the outer layer 11 in the mouth 9 more securely, the bending angle a is
preferably 120 degrees or less and the radius of curvature is preferably 2 mm or
less. Specifically, the bending angle a is, for example, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115,
 120, 125, 130, 135, and 140 degrees or it may be in a range between any two
values exemplified here. Specifically, the radius of curvature is, for example, 0.2,
0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 2 mm or it may be in a range between any
two values exemplified here.
[0027]
          As illustrated in Fig. 4, the bent portion 22 is provided in a position where
a distance L2 from a container center axis C to the container inner surface in the
bent portion 22 is 1.3 times or more of a distance Li from the container center
axis C to the container inner surface in the mouth 9. The delaminatable container
 1 in the present embodiment is formed by blow molding. The larger L2/L1 causes
a larger blow ratio in the bent portion 22, which results in a thinner thickness.
                                             6

When L2/L1 > 1.3, the thickness of the inner layer 13 in the bent portion 22 thus
becomes sufficiently thin and the inner layer 13 is easily bent at the bent portion
22 to more securely inhibit delamination of the inner layer 13 from the outer layer
 11 in the mouth 9. L2/L1 is, for example, from 1.3 to 3 and preferably from 1.4 to
2. Specifically, L2/L1 is, for example, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2, 2.5, and
3 or it may be in a range between any two values exemplified here.
[0028]
         To give an example, the thickness in the mouth 9 is from 0.45 to 0.50
mm, the thickness in the bent portion 22 is from 0.25 to 0.30 mm, and the
thickness of the main portion 19 is from 0.15 to 0.20 mm. The thickness in the
bent portion 22 is thus sufficiently less than the thickness in the mouth 9,
thereby effectively exhibiting functions of the bent portion 22.
[0029]
         As illustrated in Fig. 4, the storage portion 7 is equipped with the valve
member 5 to regulate entrance and exit of air between an external space S of the
container body 3 and an intermediate space 21 between the outer shell 12 and the
inner bag 14. The outer shell 12 is equipped with a fresh air inlet 15
communicating with the intermediate space 21 and the external space S in the
storage portion 7. The fresh air inlet 15 is a through hole provided only in the
outer shell 12 and does not reach the inner bag 14. The valve member 5 is
provided with an axis 5a inserted into the fresh air inlet 15, a lid 5c provided on
the intermediate space 21 side of the axis 5a and having a cross-sectional area
greater than that of the axis 5a, and a locking portion 5b provided on the external
space S side of the axis 5a and preventing entrance of the valve member 5 to the
intermediate space 21. In the present embodiment, the axis 5a is capable of
sliding movement relative to the fresh air inlet 15.
[0030]
         The lid 5c is configured to substantially close the fresh air inlet 15 when
the outer shell 12 is compressed and shaped to have a smaller cross-sectional
area as coming closer to the axis 5a. The locking portion 5b is configured to be
capable of introducing air in the intermediate space 21 when the outer shell 12 is
restored after compression. When the outer shell 12 is compressed, the pressure
in the intermediate space 21 becomes higher than external pressure and the air in
the intermediate space 21 leaks outside from the fresh air inlet 15. The pressure
difference and the air flow cause the lid 5c to move toward the fresh air inlet 15 to
close the fresh air inlet 15 by the lid 5c. Since the lid 5c has a shape with a
smaller cross-sectional area as coming closer to the axis 5a, the lid 5c readily fits
into the fresh air inlet 15 to close the fresh air inlet 15.
[0031]
         When the outer shell 12 is further compressed in this state, the pressure
in the intermediate space 21 is increased, and as a result, the inner bag is
compressed to deliver the contents in the inner bag 14. When the compressive
force to the outer shell 12 is released, the outer shell 12 attempts to restore its
shape by the elasticity of its own. At this point, the lid 5c is separated from the
fresh air inlet 15 and the closure of the fresh air inlet 15 is released to introduce
fresh air in the intermediate space 21. Not to cause the locking portion 5b to
close the fresh air inlet 15, the locking portion 5b is equipped with projections 5d
in a portion abutting on the outer shell 12. The projections 5d abut on the outer
shell 12 to provide gaps between the outer shell 12 and the locking portion 5b.
Instead of providing the projections 5d, closure of the fresh air inlet 15 by the
locking portion 5b may be prevented by providing grooves in the locking portion
5b. Figs. 8 and 16 through 20 illustrate specific examples of the structure of the
valve member 5.
                                             7

[0032]
          The valve member 5 is mounted to the container body 3 by inserting the
lid 5c into the intermediate space 21 while the lid 5c presses and expands the
fresh air inlet 15. The lid 5c, therefore, preferably has an end in a tapered shape.
Since such valve member 5 can be mounted only by pressing the lid 5c from
outside the container body 3 into the intermediate space 21, it is excellent in
productivity.
[0033]
          After the valve member 5 is mounted, the storage portion 7 is covered with
a shrink film. At this point, not to allow the valve member 5 to interfere with the
shrink film, the valve member 5 is mounted to a valve member mounting recess
7a provided in the storage portion 7. Not to seal the valve member mounting
recess 7a with the shrink film, an air circulation groove 7b extending from the
valve member mounting recess 7a in the direction of the mouth 9 is provided.
[0034]
          The valve member mounting recess 7a is provided in the shoulder portion
 17 of the outer shell 12. The shoulder portion 17 is an inclined surface, and a flat
region FR is provided in the valve member mounting recess 7a. Since the flat
region FR is provided approximately in parallel with the inclined surface of the
shoulder portion 17, the flat region FR is also an inclined surface. Since the fresh
air inlet 15 is provided in the flat region FR in the valve member mounting recess
7a, the fresh air inlet 15 is provided in the inclined surface. When the fresh air
inlet 15 is provided in, for example, a vertical surface of the main portion 19, there
is a risk that the once delaminated inner bag 14 makes contact with the valve
member 5 to interfere with movement of the valve member 5. In the present
embodiment, since the fresh air inlet 15 is provided in the inclined surface, there
is no such risk and smooth movement of the valve member 5 is secured.
Although not particularly limited, an inclination angle of the inclined surface is
preferably from 45 to 89 degrees, more preferably from 55 to 85 degrees, and even
more preferably from 60 to 80 degrees.
[0035]
          As illustrated in Fig. 1(c), the flat region FR in the valve member mounting
recess 7a is provided across a width W of 3 mm or more (preferably 3.5 mm, 4
mm, or more) surrounding the fresh air inlet 15. For example, when the fresh air
inlet 15 is $ 4 mm and the fresh air inlet 15 is formed at the center of the flat
region FR, the valve member mounting recess 7a is designed to be $ 10 mm or
more. Although the upper limit of the width W of the flat region FR is not
particularly defined, the width W is preferably not too large because a larger width
W of the flat region FR causes the valve member mounting recess 7a to have a
greater area, and as a result, the area of the gap between the outer shell 12 and
the shrink film. The upper limit is, for example, 10 mm. Accordingly, the width W
is, for example, from 3 tol0 mm. Specifically, it is, for example, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 mm or it may be in a range between any two values exemplified
here.
[0036]
          According to an experiment (Second Experimental Example) by the
present inventors, it is found that a wider flat region FR on an outer surface side
of the outer shell 12 causes a larger radius of curvature on an inner surface of the
outer shell 12, and when the flat region FR is provided across the range of 3 mm
or more surrounding the fresh air inlet 15 on the outer surface side of the outer
shell, the radius of curvature on the inner surface of the outer shell 12 is
sufficiently large, and as a result, the close adherence between the outer shell 12
and the valve member 5 is improved. The radius of curvature on the inner surface
                                               8

of the outer shell 12 is preferably 200 mm or more in a range of 2 mm
surrounding the fresh air inlet 15 and even more preferably 250 mm or more or
300 mm or more. This is because, when the radius of curvature has such value,
the inner surface of the outer shell 12 substantially becomes flat and the close
adherence between the outer shell 12 and the valve member 5 is good.
[0037]
          As illustrated in Fig. 1(b), the storage portion 7 has a bottom surface 29
equipped with a central concave region 29a and a peripheral region 29b
surrounding the former region, and the central concave region 29a is provided
with a bottom seal protrusion 27 protruding from the bottom surface 29. As
illustrated in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), the bottom seal protrusion 27 is a sealing portion
of a laminated parison in blow molding using a cylindrical laminated parison
provided with the outer layer 11 and the inner layer 13. The bottom seal
protrusion 27 is provided with, in order from the bottom surface 29 side, a base
portion 27d, a thinner portion 27a, and a thicker portion 27b having a thickness
greater than that of the thinner portion 27a.
[0038]
          Immediately after blow molding, as illustrated in Fig. 6(a), the bottom seal
protrusion 27 is in a state of standing approximately vertically to a plane P defined
by the peripheral region 29b. In this state, however, when impact is applied to the
container, the inner layers 13 in a welded portion 27c are prone to be separated
from each other and the impact resistance is insufficient. In the present
embodiment, the thinner portion 27a is softened by blowing hot air on the bottom
seal protrusion 27 after blow molding to bend the bottom seal protrusion 27, as
illustrated in Fig. 6(b), in the thinner portion 27a. The impact resistance of the
bottom seal protrusion 27 is thus improved simply by a simple procedure of
bending the bottom seal protrusion 27. In addition, as illustrated in Fig. 6(b), the
bottom seal protrusion 27 does not protrude from the plane P defined by the
peripheral region 29b in a state of being bent. This prevents, when the
delaminatable container 1 is stood, instability of the delaminatable container 1
due to the bottom seal protrusion 27 sticking out of the plane P.
[0039]
          The base portion 27d is provided on the bottom surface 29 side closer
than the thinner portion 27a and is an area thicker than the thinner portion 27a.
Although the base portion 27d does not have to be provided, the impact resistance
of the bottom seal protrusion 27 is further improved by providing the thinner
portion 27a on the base portion 27d.
[0040]
          As illustrated in Fig. 1(b), the concave region in the bottom surface 29 is
provided across the entire bottom surface 29 in longitudinal directions of the
bottom seal protrusion 27. That is, the central concave region 29a and the
peripheral concave region 29c are connected. Such structure facilitates bending
of the bottom seal protrusion 27.
[0041]
          The layer structure of the container body 3 is described below in further
detail. The container body 3 is provided with the outer layer 11 and the inner
layer 13.
[0042]
          The outer layer 11 is composed of, for example, low density polyethylene,
linear low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polypropylene, an
ethylene-propylene copolymer, a mixture thereof, and the like. The outer layer 11
may have a multilayer structure. For example, it may have a structure where a
reproduction layer has both sides sandwiched by polypropylene layers. Here, the
                                              9

reproduction layer refers to a layer using burrs produced while molding a
container by recycling. The outer layer 11 is formed thicker than the inner layer
 13 for better restorability.
[0043]
          In the present embodiment, the outer layer 11 includes a random
copolymer layer containing a random copolymer of propylene and another
monomer. The outer layer 11 may be a single layer of the random copolymer layer
or may be a multilayer structure. For example, it may have a structure where a
reproduction layer has both sides sandwiched by random copolymer layers. The
outer layer 11 is composed of a random copolymer of specific composition to
improve shape restorability, transparency, and heat resistance of the outer shell
 12.
[0044]
          The random copolymer has a content of a monomer other than propylene
of less than 50 mol% and preferably from 5 to 35 mol%. Specifically, this content
is, for example, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mol% or it may be in a range between
any two values exemplified here. The monomer to be copolymerized with
propylene may be one that improves impact resistance of the random copolymer
compared with a homopolymer of polypropylene, and ethylene is particularly
preferred. In the case of a random copolymer of propylene and ethylene, the
ethylene content is preferably from 5 to 30 mol%. Specifically, it is, for example,
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mol% or it may be in a range between any two values
exemplified here. The random copolymer preferably has a weight average
molecular weight from 100 thousands to 500 thousands, and even more
preferably from 100 thousands to 300 thousands. Specifically, the weight average
molecular weight is, for example, 100 thousands, 150 thousands, 200 thousands,
250 thousands, 300 thousands, 350 thousands, 400 thousands, 450 thousands,
and 500 thousands or it may be in a range between any two values exemplified
here.
[0045]
          The random copolymer has a tensile modulus of elasticity preferably from
400 to 1600 MPa and more preferably from 1000 to 1600 MPa. This is because
the shape restorability is particularly good with a tensile modulus of elasticity in
such range. Specifically, the tensile modulus of elasticity is, for example, 400,
500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, and 1600 Mpa or
it may be in a range between any two values exemplified here.
          Since an excessively hard container impairs feeling of using the container,
the outer layer 11 may be composed by, for example, mixing a softening material,
such as linear low density polyethylene, to the random copolymer. Note that, in
order not to severely interfere with effective properties of the random copolymer,
the material to be mixed with the random copolymer is preferably mixed to be less
than 50 weight% based on the entire mixture. For example, the outer layer 11
may be composed of a material in which the random copolymer is mixed with
linear low density polyethylene at a weight ratio of 85:15.
[0046]
          As illustrated in Fig. 7(a), the inner layer 13 includes an EVOH layer 13a
provided on a container outer surface side, an inner surface layer 13b provided on
a container inner surface side of the EVOH layer 13a, and an adhesion layer 13c
provided between the EVOH layer 13a and the inner surface layer 13b. By
providing the EVOH layer 13a, it is possible to improve gas barrier properties and
delamination properties from the outer layer 11.
[0047]
          The EVOH layer 13a is a layer containing an ethylene-vinyl alcohol
                                             10

copolymer (EVOH) resin and is obtained by hydrolysis of a copolymer of ethylene
and vinyl acetate. The EVOH resin has an ethylene content, for example, from 25
to 50 mol%, and from the perspective of oxygen barrier properties, it is preferably
32 mol% or less. Although not particularly defined, the lower limit of the ethylene
content is preferably 25 mol% or more because the flexibility of the EVOH layer
 13a is prone to decrease when the ethylene content is less. The EVOH layer 13a
preferably contains an oxygen absorbent. The content of an oxygen absorbent in
the EVOH layer 13a further improves the oxygen barrier properties of the EVOH
layer 13a. The EVOH resin preferably has a modulus of elasticity in bending of
2350 MPa or less and even more preferably 2250 MPa or less. Although not
particularly defined, the lower limit of the modulus of elasticity in bending of the
EVOH resin is, for example, 1800, 1900, or 2000 MPa. The modulus of elasticity
in bending is measured in a test method in accordance with ISO 178. The testing
speed is 2 mm/min.
[0048]
          The EVOH resin preferably has a melting point higher than the melting
point of the random copolymer contained in the outer layer 11. The fresh air inlet
 15 is preferably formed in the outer layer 11 using a thermal perforator, and when
the fresh air inlet 15 is formed in the outer layer 11, the inlet is prevented from
reaching the inner layer 13 by the EVOH resin having a melting point higher than
the melting point of the random copolymer. From this perspective, a greater
difference of (Melting Point of EVOH) - (Melting Point of Random Copolymer Layer)
is desired, and it is preferably 15 0 C or more and particularly preferably 30"C or
more. The difference in melting points is, for example, from 5 to 50 0 C.
Specifically, it is, for example, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50'C or it may
be in a range between any two values exemplified here.
[0049]
          The inner surface layer 13b is a layer to make contact with the contents of
the delaminatable container 1. It contains, for example, polyolefin, such as low
density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene,
polypropylene, an ethylene-propylene copolymer, and a mixture thereof, and
preferably low density polyethylene or linear low density polyethylene. The resin
contained in the inner surface layer 13b preferably has a tensile modulus of
elasticity from 50 to 300 MPa and more preferably from 70 to 200 MPa. This is
because the inner surface layer 13b is particularly flexible when the tensile
modulus of elasticity is in such range. Specifically, the tensile modulus of
elasticity is, for example, specifically for example, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300
Mpa or it may be in a range between any two values exemplified here.
[0050]
          The adhesion layer 13c is a layer having a function of adhering the EVOH
layer 13a to the inner surface layer 13b, and it is, for example, a product of
adding acid modified polyolefin (e.g., maleic anhydride modified polyethylene) with
carboxyl groups introduced therein to polyolefin described above or an ethylene
vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA). An example of the adhesion layer 13c is a mixture
of acid modified polyethylene with low density polyethylene or linear low density
polyethylene.
[0051]
          As illustrated in Fig. 7(b), the inner layer 13 may have a structure to
include an internal EVOH layer 13d as an innermost layer, an external EVOH
layer 13e as an outermost layer, and the adhesion layer 13c provided between
them.
[0052]
          The internal EVOH layer 13d contains an ethylene-vinyl alcohol
                                             11

copolymer (EVOH) resin. According to an experiment (Fourth Experimental
Example) by the present inventors, it is found that, when the innermost layer of
the inner layer 13 is the internal EVOH layer 13d, adsorption or absorption of
limonene in the container inner surface is inhibited, and as a result, the reduction
of the citrus aroma emitted by a citrus-based liquid condiment is inhibited.
[0053]
           Since EVOH resins have relatively high rigidity, such EVOH resin is
normally used by adding a softening agent to the EVOH resin for use as a material
for the inner layer 13 to improve the flexibility. There is a risk, however, in adding
a softening agent to the EVOH resin contained in the internal EVOH layer 13d as
the innermost layer of the inner layer 13 of eluting the softening agent in the
contents. Therefore, as the EVOH resin contained in the internal EVOH layer 13d,
one that does not contain a softening agent has to be used. Meanwhile, since the
EVOH resin not containing a softening agent has high rigidity, a problem occurs
that, when the internal EVOH layer 13d is too thick, the inner bag 14 is not prone
to be shrunk smoothly at delivery of the contents. When the internal EVOH layer
 13d is too thin, the internal EVOH layer 13d is not formed uniformly and there are
problems that the adhesion layer 13c is exposed to the container inner surface
and a pinhole is prone to be formed in the internal EVOH layer 13d. From such
perspective, the internal EVOH layer 13d preferably has a thickness from 10 to 20
JAm.
[0054]
          The EVOH resin contained in the internal EVOH layer 13d has an
ethylene content, for example, from 25 to 50 mol%. Since a greater ethylene
content facilitates improvement in flexibility of the internal EVOH layer 13d, the
ethylene content is preferably higher than that of the EVOH resin contained in the
external EVOH layer 13e and it is preferred to be 35 mol% or more. In other
words, the EVOH resin contained in the internal EVOH layer 13d preferably has
an ethylene content set to have a tensile modulus of elasticity of the EVOH resin
of 2000 MPa or less.
[0055]
          The external EVOH layer 13e also contains an ethylene-vinyl alcohol
copolymer (EVOH) resin similar to the internal EVOH layer 13d. Note that, since
the external EVOH layer 13e does not make contact with the contents, the
flexibility may be increased by adding a softening agent, and for that purpose, the
external EVOH layer 13e may have a thickness thicker than that of the internal
EVOH layer. Although not particularly limited, the external EVOH layer 13e has a
thickness, for example, from 20 to 30 [Lm. A problem occurs that the gas barrier
properties of the inner layer 13 become insufficient when the external EVOH layer
 13e is too thin, and another occurs that the flexibility of the inner layer 13
becomes insufficient when the external EVOH layer 13e is too thick, causing the
inner bag 14 not prone to be shrunk smoothly at delivery of the contents.
Although not particularly limited, a ratio of thicknesses of the external EVOH
layer 13e/internal EVOH layer 13d is, for example, from 1.1 to 4 and preferably
from 1.2 to 2.0. Specifically, the ratio is, for example, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6,
 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3, and 4 or it may be in a range between
any two values exemplified here. By providing the external EVOH layer 13e as the
outermost layer of the inner layer 13, it is possible to improve the delamination
properties of the inner layer 13 from the outer layer 11.
[0056]
          The EVOH resin contained in the external EVOH layer 13e has an
ethylene content, for example, from 25 to 50 mol%, and from the perspective of
oxygen barrier properties, it is preferably 32 mol% or less. Although not
                                              12

particularly defined, the lower limit of the ethylene content is preferably25 mol%
or more because a less ethylene content causes a decrease in flexibility of the
external EVOH layer 13e.
[0057]
          It is preferred that an amount of adding the softening agent to the EVOH
resin contained in the external EVOH layer 13e and the ethylene content of the
EVOH resin are set in such a manner that the EVOH resin has a tensile modulus
of elasticity of 2000 MPa or less. Composition of both the internal EVOH layer
 13d and the external EVOH layer 13e by EVOH resins having a tensile modulus of
elasticity of2000 MPa or less enables smooth shrinking of the inner bag 14. The
external EVOH layer 13e preferably contains an oxygen absorbent. By containing
an oxygen absorbent in the external EVOH layer 13e, it is possible to further
improve the oxygen barrier properties of the external EVOH layer 13e.
[0058]
          The EVOH resin contained in the external EVOH layer 13e preferably has
a melting point higher than the melting point of the random copolymer contained
in the outer layer 11. The fresh air inlet 15 is preferably formed in the outer layer
 11 using a thermal perforator, and when the fresh air inlet 15 is formed in the
outer layer 11, the inlet is prevented from reaching the inner layer 13 by the
EVOH resin having a melting point higher than the melting point of the random
copolymer. From this perspective, a greater difference of (Melting Point of EVOH)
(Melting Point of Random Copolymer Layer) is desired, and it is preferably 15'C or
more and particularly preferably 30 0 C or more. The difference in melting points
is, for example, from 5 to 50'C. Specifically, it is, for example, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
30, 35, 40, 45, and 50'C or it may be in a range between any two values
exemplified here.
[0059]
          The adhesion layer 13c is a layer arranged between the internal EVOH
layer 13d and the external EVOH layer 13e, and it is, for example, a product of
adding acid modified polyolefin (e.g., maleic anhydride modified polyethylene) with
carboxyl groups introduced therein to polyolefin described above or an ethylene
vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA). An example of the adhesion layer 13c is a mixture
of acid modified polyethylene with low density polyethylene or linear low density
polyethylene. The adhesion layer 13c may directly adhere the internal EVOH layer
 13d to the external EVOH layer 13e or may indirectly adhere via another layer
provided between the adhesion layer 13c and the internal EVOH layer 13d or
between the adhesion layer 13c and the external EVOH layer 13e.
[0060]
          The adhesion layer 13c is a layer having rigidity per unit thickness less
than that of any of the internal EVOH layer 13d and the external EVOH layer 13e,
that is, a layer excellent in flexibility. Therefore, by thickening the adhesion layer
 13c to increase the ratio of the thickness of the adhesion layer 13c to the
thickness of the entire inner layer 13, the flexibility of the inner layer 13 is
increased and the inner bag 14 readily shrinks smoothly at delivery of the
contents. Specifically, the adhesion layer 13c preferably has a thickness greater
than a total of the thickness of the internal EVOH layer 13d and the thickness of
the external EVOH layer 13e. The ratio of thicknesses of Adhesion Layer 13c /
(Internal EVOH Layer 13d + External EVOH Layer 13e) is, for example, from 1.1 to
8. Specifically, the ratio is, for example, 1.1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7,
and 8 or it may be in a range between any two values exemplified here.
[0061]
          Then, an example of a method of manufacturing the delaminatable
container 1 in the present embodiment is described.
                                             13

          Firstly, as illustrated in Fig. 9(a) a laminated parison in a melted state
with a laminated structure (in an example, as illustrated in Fig. 9(a), a laminated
structure of PE layer / adhesion layer / EVOH layer / PP layer in order from the
container inner surface side) corresponding to the container body 3 to be
manufactured is extruded to set the laminated parison in the melted state in a
blow molding die and the split die is closed.
          Then, as illustrated in Fig. 9(b), a blowing nozzle is inserted into an
opening of the mouth 9 of the container body 3 to blow air into a cavity of the split
die in the mold closing state.
[0062]
          Then, as illustrated in Fig. 9(c), the split die is opened to take out a blow
molded article. The split die has a cavity shape to form various shapes of the
container body 3, such as the valve member mounting recess 7a, the air
circulation groove 7b, and the bottom seal protrusion 27, in the blow molded
article. The split die is provided with a pinch-off below the bottom seal protrusion
27. Lower burrs are thus formed in the area below the bottom seal protrusion 27
and they are removed.
[0063]
          Then, as illustrated in Fig. 9(d), blow molded articles thus taken out are
aligned.
          Then, as illustrated in Fig. 9(e), a hole is made only in the outer layer 11
in an upper tubular portion 31 provided above the mouth 9 to blow air between
the outer layer 11 and the inner layer 13 using a blower 33 for preliminary
delamination of the inner layer 13 from the outer layer 11 in a portion, of the
storage portion 7, to mount the valve member 5 (valve member mounting recess
7a). The preliminary delamination facilitates a procedure to form the fresh air
inlet 15 and a procedure to mount the valve member 5. To prevent leakage of the
blown air from the end side of the upper tubular portion 31, the end side of the
upper tubular portion 31 may be covered with a cover member. In order to
facilitate making a hole only in the outer layer 11, the inner layer 13 may
delaminate from the outer layer 11 in the upper tubular portion 31 by squashing
the upper tubular portion 31 before making a hole. The preliminary delamination
may be applied to the entire storage portion 7 or to part of the storage portion 7.
          Then, as illustrated in Fig. 9(f), the fresh air inlet 15 is formed in the outer
shell 12 using a boring tool. The fresh air inlet is preferably a circular hole while
it may be in another shape.
[0064]
          The procedures of inner layer preliminary delamination and fresh air inlet
opening may be in the following method.
          Firstly, as illustrated in Fig. 10(a), the air in the inner bag 14 is sucked
from the mouth 9 to reduce the pressure in the inner bag 14. In this state, a
perforator, such as a heat pipe or a pipe cutter, is gradually pressed against the
outer layer 11. The perforator has a tubular cutter and the air inside the tube is
sucked. In a state where a hole is not made in the outer layer 11, no air enters
between the outer layer 11 and the inner layer 13 and thus the inner layer 13
does not delaminate from the outer layer 11.
[0065]
          When the tubular cutter penetrates the outer layer 11, as illustrated in
Fig. 10(b), the cut piece that is hollowed out is removed through the tubular cutter
and the fresh air inlet 15 is formed. At this moment, air enters between the outer
layer 11 and the inner layer 13 and the inner layer 13 delaminates from the outer
layer 11.
[0066]
                                              14

         Then, as illustrated in Figs. 10(c) and 10(d), the diameter of the fresh air
inlet 15 is enlarged using a boring tool. When the fresh air inlet 15 in a size
sufficient for insertion of the valve member 5 is formed in the procedures in Figs.
 10(a) and 10(b), the diameter enlargement procedure in Figs. 10(c) and 10(d) are
not required.
[0067]
         The procedures of inner layer preliminary delamination and fresh air inlet
opening may be in the following method. Here, with reference to Figs. 11(a)
through 11(f), a method is described in which the fresh air inlet 15 is formed in
the outer shell 12 of the delaminatable container 1 using a thermal perforator 2,
followed by preliminary delamination.
[0068]
         Firstly, as illustrated in Fig. 11(a), the delaminatable container 1 is set in
a position in proximity to the perforator 2. The perforator 2 is provided with a
tubular cutter blade 2a, a motor 2c to rotationally drive the cutter blade 2a
through a transmission belt 2b, and a heating device 2d to heat the cutter blade
2a. The perforator 2 is supported by a servo cylinder (not shown) to single-axis
move the perforator 2 by rotation of a servo motor and is configured movably in an
arrow X1 direction in Fig. 11(c) and in an arrow X2 direction in Fig. 11(e). Such
structure enables rotation of the heated cutter blade 2a while pressing the edge
against the outer shell 12 of the delaminatable container 1. The control of the
position and the moving speed of the perforator 2 by the servo motor enables
reduction in tact time.
[0069]
         The cutter blade 2a is coupled to a ventilation pipe 2e in communication
with a hollow in the cutter blade 2a, and the ventilation pipe 2e is coupled to an
air intake and exhaust system, not shown. This enables air suction from inside
the cutter blade 2a and air blowing inside the cutter blade 2a. The heating device
2d is provided with a coil 2f formed of a conductive wire and configured to heat
the cutter blade 2a by the principle of electromagnetic induction by applying an
alternating current to the coil 2f. The heating device 2d is arranged in proximity
to a blow molded article la and separate from the cutter blade 2a. Such structure
simplifies wiring of the heating device 2d and enables efficient heating of the edge
of the cutter blade 2a.
[0070]
         Then, as illustrated in Fig. 11(b), the perforator 2 is brought close to the
delaminatable container 1 for penetration of the cutter blade 2a into the coil 2f.
By applying an alternating current to the coil 2f in this state, the cutter blade 2a
is heated.
[0071]
         Then, as illustrated in Fig. 11(c), the perforator 2 is moved at high speed
in the arrow X1 direction to the position where the edge of the cutter blade 2a
reaches immediately in front of the delaminatable container 1.
[0072]
         Then, as illustrated in Fig. 11(d), while a suction force is exerted on the
edge of the cutter blade 2a by sucking air inside the cutter blade 2a, the
perforator 2 is brought close to the delaminatable container 1 at very slow speed
for penetration of the edge of the cutter blade 2a into the outer shell 12 of the
delaminatable container 1. Such combination of high speed movement and very
slow speed movement enables reduction in tact time. Although the entire
perforator 2 is moved in the present embodiment, another embodiment may apply
where only the cutter blade 2a is moved by a cylinder mechanism or the like and
the cutter blade 2a is moved at high speed to the position where the edge of the
                                             15

cutter blade 2a reaches immediately in front of the delaminatable container 1 and
the cutter blade 2a is moved at very slow speed for penetration of the cutter blade
2a into the outer shell 12.
[0073]
          When the edge of the cutter blade 2a reaches the boundary between the
outer shell 12 and the inner bag 14, the outer shell 12 is hollowed out in the
shape of the edge of the cutter blade 2a to form the fresh air inlet 15. A cut piece
 15a that is hollowed out of the outer shell 12 is sucked in the hollow of the cutter
blade 2a. The cutter blade 2a may stop the movement when the edge reaches the
boundary between the outer shell 12 and the inner bag 14, whereas it may be
moved until the edge of the cutter blade 2a is pressed against the inner bag 14
beyond the interface between the outer shell 12 and the inner bag 14 to form the
fresh air inlet 15 more securely. At this point, to inhibit damage in the inner bag
 14 by the cutter blade 2a, the shape of the edge of the cutter blade 2a is
preferably a rounded shape as illustrated in Fig. 12(b) to a sharp shape as
illustrated in Fig. 12(a). Although the fresh air inlet 15 is not easily formed in the
outer shell 12 with a rounded edge of the cutter blade 2a, the present embodiment
enables easy formation of the fresh air inlet 15 in the outer shell 12 by rotating
the heated cutter blade 2a. Not to melt the inner bag 14 by the heat of the cutter
blade 2a, the resin contained in the outermost layer of the inner bag 14 preferably
has a melting point higher than the melting point of the resin contained in the
innermost layer of the outer shell 12.
[0074]
          Then, as illustrated in Fig. 11(e), the perforator 2 is set back in the arrow
X2 direction to blow air into the hollow of the cutter blade 2a, thereby emitting the
cut piece 15a from the edge of the cutter blade 2a.
          In the above procedures, formation of the fresh air inlet 15 in the outer
shell 12 is completed.
[0075]
          Then, as illustrated in Fig. 11(f), air is blown between the outer shell 12
and the inner bag 14 through the fresh air inlet 15 using the blower 33 for
preliminary delamination of the inner bag 14 from the outer shell 12. By blowing
air in a defined amount while avoiding air leakage through the fresh air inlet 15,
preliminary delamination of the inner bag 14 is readily controlled. Although the
preliminary delamination may be applied to the entire storage portion 7 or may be
applied to part of the storage portion 7, it is preferred that preliminary
delamination of the inner bag 14 from the outer shell 12 in approximately the
entire storage portion 7 because it is not possible to check the presence of a
pinhole in the inner bag 14 in a portion not subjected to preliminary
delamination.
[0076]
          Then, as illustrated in Fig. 13(a), the thinner portion 27a is softened by
exposing the bottom seal protrusion 27 to hot air to bend the bottom seal
protrusion 27.
[0077]
          Then, as illustrated in Fig. 13(b), the inner bag 14 is checked for a
pinhole. Specifically, firstly, an adapter 35 is mounted to the mouth 9 and an
inspection gas containing a specific type of gas is injected in the inner bag 14
through the mouth 9. When a pinhole is present in the inner bag 14, the specific
type of gas leaks to the intermediate space 21 through the pinhole and is
discharged outside the container through the fresh air inlet 15 from the
intermediate space 21. Outside the container, in a position in proximity to the
fresh air inlet 15, a sensor (detector) 37 for the specific type of gas is arranged,
                                              16

which enables sensing of leakage of the specific type of gas. When the
concentration of the specific type of gas sensed by the sensor 37 is at a threshold
or less, determination is made that a pinhole is not present in the inner bag 14
and the delaminatable container 1 is determined as a good product. In contrast,
when the concentration of the specific type of gas sensed by the sensor 37 exceeds
the threshold, determination is made that a pinhole is present in the inner bag 14
and the delaminatable container 1 is determined as a defective product. The
delaminatable container 1 determined as a defective product is removed from the
production line.
[0078]
         As the specific type of gas, a type of gas present in a less amount in the
air (preferably a type of gas at 1% or less) is selected preferably and examples of it
may include hydrogen, carbon dioxide, helium, argon, neon, and the like. The
concentration of the specific type of gas in the inspection gas is not particularly
limited, and the inspection gas may be composed only of the specific type of gas or
may be a mixed gas of air and the specific type of gas.
[0079]
         Although not particularly limited, the injection pressure of the inspection
gas is, for example, from 1.5 to 4.0 kPa. When the injection pressure is too low,
the leakage of the specific type of gas is sometimes too little to sense the specific
type of gas even though a pinhole is present. When the injection pressure is too
high, the inner bag 14 expands and is pressed against the outer shell 12
immediately after injection of the inspection gas, resulting in a decrease in
accuracy of check for a pinhole of the inner bag 14.
[0080]
         Although the sensor 37 is arranged outside the delaminatable container 1
in proximity to the fresh air inlet 15 in the present embodiment, the sensor 37
may be inserted into the intermediate space 21 through the fresh air inlet 15 to
detect the specific type of gas in the intermediate space 21 as a modification. In
this case, it is possible to sense the specific type of gas before diffusion of the
specific type of gas passing through a pinhole in the inner bag 14, and thus the
accuracy of sensing the specific type of gas is improved. As still another
modification, the inspection gas containing the specific type of gas may be injected
in the intermediate space 21 from the fresh air inlet 15 to sense the specific type
of gas leaked to the inner bag 14 through a pinhole in the inner bag 14. In this
case, the sensor 37 may be arranged outside the container in a position in
proximity to the mouth 9 or the sensor 37may be inserted into the inner bag 14
from the mouth 9.
[0081]
         The delaminatable container 1 after checked for a pinhole may be
forwarded directly to a next procedure, whereas in a modification it may be
forwarded to a next procedure after a procedure of expanding the inner bag 14 by
blowing air into the inner bag 14. In the case of the latter, an air blowing
procedure in Fig. 13(e) may be omitted.
[0082]
         Then, as illustrated in Fig. 13(c), the valve member 5 is inserted into the
fresh air inlet 15.
         Then, as illustrated in Fig. 13(d), the upper tubular portion 31 is cut.
         Then, as illustrated in Fig. 13(e), the inner bag 14 is expanded by blowing
air into the inner bag 14.
         Then, as illustrated in Fig. 13(f), the inner bag 14 is filled with the
contents.
         Then, as illustrated in Fig. 13(g), the cap 23 is mounted on the mouth 9.
                                             17

          Then, as illustrated in Fig. 13(h), the storage portion 7 is covered with a
shrink film to complete the product.
[0083]
          The order of various procedures described here may be switched
appropriately. For example, the hot air bending procedure may be before the
fresh air inlet opening procedure or may be before the inner layer preliminary
delamination procedure. The procedure of cutting the upper tubular portion 31
may be before inserting the valve member 5 into the fresh air inlet 15.
[0084]
          Then, working principle of the product thus manufactured in use is
described.
          As illustrated in Figs. 14(a) through 14(c), in a state where the product
filled with the contents, a side of the outer shell 12 is squeezed for compression to
deliver the contents. At the start of use, there is substantially no gap between the
inner bag 14 and the outer shell 12, and thus the compressive force applied to the
outer shell 12 directly becomes a compressive force to the inner bag 14 and the
inner bag 14 is compressed to deliver the contents.
[0085]
          The cap 23 has a built-in check valve, not shown, so that it is capable of
delivering the contents in the inner bag 14 but not capable of taking fresh air in
the inner bag 14. Therefore, when the compressive force applied to the outer shell
 12 is removed after delivery of the contents, the outer shell 12 attempts to be back
in the original shape by the restoring force of itself but the inner bag 14 remains
deflated and only the outer shell 12 expands. Then, as illustrated in Fig. 14(d),
inside the intermediate space 21 between the inner bag 14 and the outer shell 12
is in a reduced pressure state to introduce fresh air in the intermediate space 21
through the fresh air inlet 15 formed in the outer shell 12. When the intermediate
space 21 is in a reduced pressure state, the lid 5c is not pressed against the fresh
air inlet 15 and thus it does not interfere with introduction of fresh air. Not to
cause the locking portion 5b to interfere with introduction of fresh air even in a
state where the locking portion 5b makes contact with the outer shell 12, the
locking portion 5b is provided with an air passage securing mechanism, such as
the projections 5d and grooves.
[0086]
          Then, as illustrated in Fig. 14(e), when the side of the outer shell 12 is
again squeezed for compression, the lid 5c closes the fresh air inlet 15 to increase
the pressure in the intermediate space 21, and the compressive force applied to
the outer shell 12 is transmitted to the inner bag 14 via the intermediate space 21
and the inner bag 14 is compressed by this force to deliver the contents.
[0087]
          Then, as illustrated in Fig. 14(f), when the compressive force applied to
the outer shell 12 is removed after delivery of the contents, the outer shell 12 is
restored in the original shape by the restoring force of itself while fresh air is
introduced in the intermediate space 21 from the fresh air inlet 15.
[0088]
2. Second Embodiment
          Then, with reference to Figs. 15, a delaminatable container 1 in a second
embodiment of the present invention is described. The delaminatable container 1
in the present embodiment has the layer structure and the functions same as
those in the first embodiment, whereas it is different in a specific shape. The
delaminatable container 1 in the present embodiment is particularly different in
the configuration of and around a valve member mounting recess 7a from the first
embodiment, and thus the descriptions are given below mainly on this point.
                                             18

[0089]
          As illustrated in Fig. 15(a), the delaminatable container 1 in the present
embodiment is structured by coupling a mouth 9 to a main portion 19 by a
shoulder portion 17. While the bent portion 22 is provided in the shoulder portion
 17 in the first embodiment, the shoulder portion 17 is not provided with a bent
portion 22 in the present embodiment and the boundary between the shoulder
portion 17 and the main portion 19 functions in the same manner as the bent
portion 22 to inhibit delamination of an inner bag 14 from reaching the mouth 9.
[0090]
          The valve member mounting recess 7a is provided in the main portion 19
composed of an approximately vertical wall, and the valve member mounting
recess 7a is equipped with a flat region FR. The flat region FR is an inclined
surface at approximately 70 degrees. The flat region FR is provided with a fresh
air inlet 15, and a width W of the flat region FR surrounding the fresh air inlet 15
is 3 mm or more same as in the first embodiment. The valve member mounting
recess 7a has side walls 7c of tapered surfaces extending toward outside to
facilitate a die to form the valve member mounting recess 7a to be taken away. As
illustrated in Fig. 15(c), the inner bag 14 starts from an upper edge 7d of the flat
region FR for ease of delamination.
[0091]
3. Third Embodiment
          Then, with reference to Figs. 21, a delaminatable container 1 in a third
embodiment of the present invention is described. The delaminatable container 1
in the present embodiment has the layer structure and the functions same as
those in the first and second embodiments, whereas it is different in the structure
of a valve member 5.
[0092]
          Specifically, the valve member 5 in the present embodiment has a locking
portion 5b provided with a pair of foundation portions 5b 1 and a bridge portion
5b2 disposed between the foundation portions 5bl. An axis 5a is provided on the
bridge portion 5b2.
[0093]
          The lid 5c is configured to substantially close the fresh air inlet 15 when
the outer shell 12 is compressed and is provided with a tapered surface 5d to have
a smaller cross-sectional area as coming closer to the axis 5a. An inclination
angle P of the tapered surface 5d illustrated in Fig. 21(c) is preferably from 15 to
45 degrees to a direction D in which the axis 5a extends and even more preferably
from 20 to 35 degrees. This is because air leakage is prone to occur when the
inclination angle p is too large and the valve member 5 becomes long when too
small.
[0094]
          As illustrated in Fig. 21(d), the locking portion 5b is configured, in a state
of mounted to the fresh air inlet 15, in such a manner that the foundation
portions 5b1 has abutment surfaces 5e to abut on the outer shell 12 and the
bridge portion 5b2 deflects. According to such structure, a restoring force is
generated in the bridge portion 5b2 in a direction separating from the container as
illustrated by an arrow FO, thereby exerting a biasing force in the same direction
on the lid 5c to press the lid 5c against the outer shell 12.
[0095]
          In this state, the lid 5c is only lightly pressed against the outer shell 12.
However, when the outer shell 12 is compressed, the pressure in the intermediate
space 21 becomes higher than external pressure and the pressure difference
causes the lid 5c to be even stronger pressed against the fresh air inlet 15 to close
                                              19

the fresh air inlet 15 by the lid 5c. Since the lid 5c is equipped with the tapered
surface 5d, the lid 5c readily fits into the fresh air inlet 15 to close the fresh air
inlet 15.
[0096]
          When the outer shell 12 is further compressed in this state, the pressure
in the intermediate space 21 is increased, and as a result, the inner bag 14 is
compressed to deliver the contents in the inner bag 14. When the compressive
force to the outer shell 12 is released, the outer shell 12 attempts to restore its
shape by the elasticity of its own. The pressure in the intermediate space 21 is
reduced with the restoration of the outer shell 12, thereby applying a force Fl, as
illustrated in Fig. 21(e), in a direction inside the container to the lid 5c. This
increases the deflection of the bridge portion 5b2 and forms a gap Z between the
lid 5c and the outer shell 12 to introduce fresh air in the intermediate space 21
through a path 5f between the bridge portion 5b2 and the outer shell 12, the fresh
air inlet 15, and the gap Z.
[0097]
          The valve member 5 in the present embodiment can be molded by
injection molding or the like using a split die of a simple configuration that splits
in an arrow X direction along a parting line L illustrated in Fig. 21(a) and thus is
excellent in productivity.
Examples
[0098]
 1. First Experimental Example
          In the experimental example below, a delaminatable container having the
outer layer 11 and the inner layer 13 was produced by blow molding, and the
fresh air inlet 15 of $ 4 mm was formed only in the outer layer 11 having a
thickness of 0.7 mm using a thermal perforator. In addition, valve members 5 of
first through fifth structural examples illustrated in Figs. 16 through 20 and
indicated in Table 1 were manufactured by injection molding, and the lid 5c of
such valve member 5 was pressed into the intermediate space 21 through the
fresh air inlet 15.
[0099]
          The valve members 5 in the first through fifth structural examples were
evaluated in operability, moldability, tilt resistance, and transferability. The
results are indicated in Table 1 below. The symbols X, A, and 0 in each
evaluation point in Table 1 are relative evaluation results, where A denotes an
evaluation result better than X and 0 denotes an evaluation result better than A.

[0101]
          The operability is evaluation of whether or not the fresh air inlet 15 is
smoothly opened and closed by the valve member 5. In the first structural
example where the axis 5a has a length shorter than a thickness of the outer layer
 11, a slidable length was 0 and the fresh air inlet 15 remained closed. In the
second structural example, although the fresh air inlet 15 was opened and closed
by the valve member 5, the operation was sometimes not smooth. In contrast, in
the third through fifth structural examples, the fresh air inlet 15 was smoothly
opened and closed by the valve member 5. The reasons why the valve member 5
did not operate smoothly in the second structural example may include that the
slidable length (length of axis 5a - thickness of outer layer 11) was 0.7 mm, which
was not a sufficient length, and that the clearance to the fresh air inlet 15
(diameter of fresh air inlet 15 - diameter of axis 5a) was 0.2 mm, which was not a
sufficient size. In contrast, in the third through fifth structural examples, the
slidable length was 1 mm or more, which was a sufficient length, and the
clearance to the fresh air inlet 15 was 0.3 mm or more, which was a sufficient
size, so that the valve member 5 operated smoothly. When the slidable length
exceeds 2 mm, the valve member 5 is prone to interfere with the shrink film and
the inner layer 13, and thus the valve member 5 preferably has a slidable length
from 1 to 2 mm.
[0102]
          The moldability is evaluation of ease of molding the valve member 5 by
injection molding. When the surface of the locking portion 5b on the axis 5a side
was provided with the projections 5d as in the first structural example or four
grooves 5e circumferentially at regular intervals as in the second structural
example, the valve member 5 after molding had to be forcibly taken out of the split
die or a split die with a special configuration had to be prepared, so that the
moldability was poor. In contrast, when two grooves 5e were provided
circumferentially at regular intervals as in the third through fifth structural
examples, the valve member 5 was readily taken out of the split die and the
moldability was excellent.
[0103]
          The tilt resistance is evaluation of whether or not a gap is prone to be
formed in the fresh air inlet 15 when the valve member 5 is tilted in a state where
the lid 5c is pressed against the fresh air inlet 15. When the shape at a boundary
5f between the lid 5c and the axis 5a was a curved shape depressing inside as in
the first and second structural examples, a gap was prone to be formed in the
                                            21

fresh air inlet 15 when the valve member 5 was tilted. In contrast, when the
shape of the boundary 5f between the lid 5c and the axis 5a was a curved shape
bulged outside as in the third through fifth structural examples, a gap was not
prone to be formed in the fresh air inlet 15 when the valve member 5 was tilted.
In the third structural example, the clearance to the fresh air inlet 15 was 0.7
mm, which is too large, and the valve member 5 was tilted considerably and thus
a gap was relatively prone to be formed. In contrast, in the fourth and fifth
structural examples, the clearance to the fresh air inlet 15 was 0.6 mm or less,
which was an adequate size, and an excessive tilt of the valve member 5 was
inhibited. Considering both the operability and the tilt resistance, the clearance
to the fresh air inlet 15 is preferably from 0.2 to 0.7 mm and even more preferably
from 0.3 to 0.6 mm.
[0104]
          The transferability is evaluation of whether or not a large number of valve
members 5 are readily transferred using a part feeder to hold the valve members 5
on two parallel rails at an interval slightly greater than the diameter of the lid 5c.
The valve members 5 were inserted between the two rails with the lid 5c
downward and held on the parallel rails by being caught on the parallel rails at
the locking portion 5b. The transferability is further classified into anti-overlap
properties and anti-fall properties.
[0105]
          The anti-overlap properties are evaluation of probability of not overlapping
the locking portions 5b of the valve member 5 with each other. In the first
through fourth structural examples, the locking portion 5b had a thickness of 1
mm, which was not a sufficient thickness, and thus the locking portions 5b were
prone to be overlapped with each other. In contrast, in the fifth structural
example, the locking portion 5b had a thickness of not less than 1.2 mm, which
was a sufficient thickness, and the locking portions 5b were not prone to be
overlapped with each other.
[0106]
          The anti-fall properties are evaluation of whether or not the valve
members 5 are appropriately held on the parallel rails without being dislocated
and falling out of the parallel rails. In the first through fourth structural
examples, the amount of the locking portion 5b sticking out (diameter of locking
portion 5b - diameter of lid 5c) was 1.5 mm or less, which was too small, and the
valve members 5 were prone to fall out of the parallel rails. In contrast, in the
fifth structural example, the amount of the locking portion 5b sticking out was not
less than 2 mm, and the valve members 5 did not fall out of the parallel rails and
readily transferred using the parallel rails.
[0107]
          The valve member 5 in the fifth structural example, as illustrated in Fig.
20(c), was equipped with a recess 5g in the outer surface of the locking portion 5b.
When the valve member 5 is injection molded, burrs are formed in the position of
an injection gate. By designing the position of the injection gate in the recess 5g,
it is possible to avoid the burrs interfering with the shrink film.
[0108]
2. Second Experimental Example
          In the experimental example below, a delaminatable container having the
outer layer 11 and the inner layer 13 was produced by blow molding and the fresh
air inlet 15 was formed only in the outer layer 11 having a thickness of 0.7 mm
using a thermal perforator. By variously changing an inner capacity of the
delaminatable container, a size of the fresh air inlet 15, and the width W
surrounding the fresh air inlet 15 in the flat region FR in the valve member
                                            22

mounting recess 7a, delaminatable containers of sample No. 1 through 5 were
formed. In addition, the valve member 5 in the shape illustrated in Figs. 20 was
produced by injection molding and the lid 5c of the valve member 5 was pressed
into the intermediate space 21 through the fresh air inlet 15. The delaminatable
container 1 thus obtained was filled with the contents (water), followed by
pressing a side of the delaminatable container to deliver the contents from the
delaminatable container. Delivery performance when the contents at 80% of the
inner capacity were delivered (delivery performance for a small amount of the
contents) was evaluated. The evaluation was made as "O" for delivery of the
contents with no trouble and as "X" for uneasy delivery of the contents. The
results are indicated in Table 2.
[0109]
[Table 21
             Sample No.                     1        2         3         4         5

     Width W of Flat Region FR            2.0       2.1       2.2       4.2       4.0

      Shell Inner Surface (mm)
[0110]
         As indicated in Table 2, samples No. 1 through 3 had low delivery
performance for a small amount of the contents and samples No. 4 through 5 had
high delivery performance for a small amount of the contents. To review reasons
of such results, each sample was measured on a radius of curvature on the inner
surface of the outer shell 12 in a range of 2 mm surrounding the fresh air inlet 15,
and the results indicated in Table 2 were obtained. As indicated in Table 2, when
the width W of the flat region FR on the outer surface of the outer shell 12 was 3
mm or more, it was found that the radius of curvature on the inner surface of the
outer shell 12 became severely large and the inner surface of the outer shell 12
became approximately flat. In contrast, when the width W of the flat region FR on
the outer surface of the outer shell 12 was less than 3 mm, it was found that the
inner surface of the outer shell 12 did not become flat but curved. Then, it was
found that the delivery performance for a small amount of the contents was
lowered by air leakage from the fresh air inlet 15 because of the curved surface
did not appropriately match the valve member 5.
[0111]
3. Third Experimental Example
         In the experimental example below, various delaminatable containers
having different layer structures were produced by blow molding for various types
of evaluation, such as restorability, rigidity, impact resistance, heat resistance,
transparency, gas barrier properties, moldability, and outer layer processability.
The outer layer processability indicates ease of process of forming the fresh air
inlet 15 only in the outer layer 11 using a thermal perforator.
[0112]
<First Structural Example>
         In the first structural example, the layer structure was, in order from
outside the container, random copolymer layer / EVOH layer / adhesion layer /
LLDPE layer. For the random copolymer layer, a random copolymer of propylene
and ethylene (model: NOVATEC EG7FTB, produced by Japan Polypropylene Corp.,
melting point of 150cC) was used. For the EVOH layer, EVOH having a high
                                            23

melting point (model: Soarnol SF7503B, produced by Nippon Synthetic Chemical
Industry Co., Ltd., melting point of 188'C, modulus of elasticity in bending of
2190 MPa) was used. According to the above various types of evaluation, excellent
results were obtained in all evaluation categories.
[0113]
<Second Structural Example>
         In the second structural example, the layer structure was, in order from
outside the container, random copolymer layer / reproduction layer / random
copolymer layer / EVOH layer / adhesion layer / LLDPE layer. The reproduction
layer is made from a material obtained by recycling burrs produced while molding
a container and has composition very close to that of the random copolymer layer.
The random copolymer layer and the EVOH layer were formed of materials same
as those in the first structural example. According to the above various types of
evaluation, excellent results were obtained in all evaluation categories.
[0114]
<Third Structural Example>
         In the third structural example, the layer structure was same as that in
the first structural example while, for the EVOH layer, EVOH having a low melting
point (model: Soarnol A4412, produced by Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry
Co., Ltd., melting point of 164'C) was used. According to the above various types
of evaluation, excellent results were obtained in all evaluation categories other
than the outer layer processability. The outer layer processability was slightly
worse than that in the first structural example. This result demonstrates that the
difference of (melting point of EVOH) - (melting point of random copolymer layer) is
preferably 15'C or more.
[0115]
<First Comparative Structural Example>
         In the first comparative structural example, the layer structure was, in
order from outside the container, LDPE layer / EVOH layer / adhesion layer /
LLDPE layer. According to the above various types of evaluation, at least the
rigidity and the heat resistance were low.
[0116]
          <Second comparative Structural Example>
         In the second comparative structural example, the layer structure was, in
order from outside the container, HDPE layer / EVOH layer / adhesion layer /
LLDPE layer. According to the above various types of evaluation, at least the
restorability and the transparency were low.
[0117]
<Third Comparative Structural Example>
         In the third comparative structural example, the layer structure was, in
order from outside the container, polypropylene layer / EVOH layer / adhesion
layer / LLDPE layer. For the material for the polypropylene layer, a homopolymer
of propylene having a melting point of 160 0 C was used. For the EVOH layer, the
material same as that in the first structural example was used. According to the
above various types of evaluation, at least the impact resistance was low. In
addition, the outer layer processability was worse than that in the first structural
example.
[0118]
<Fourth Comparative Structural Example>
         In the fourth comparative structural example, the layer structure was, in
order from outside the container, block copolymer layer / EVOH layer / adhesion
layer / LLDPE layer. According to the above various types of evaluation, at least
the transparency and the impact resistance were low.
                                          24

[0119]
 Fifth Comparative Structural Example>
          In the fifth comparative structural example, the layer structure was, in
order from outside the container, PET layer / EVOH layer / adhesion layer /
LLDPE layer. According to the above various types of evaluation, at least the
moldability and the heat resistance were low.
[0120]
<Sixth Comparative Structural Example>
          In the sixth comparative structural example, the layer structure was, in
order from outside the container, polyamide layer / EVOH layer / adhesion layer /
LLDPE layer. According to the above various types of evaluation, at least the

adhesion layer / LLDPE layer. According to the above various types of evaluation,
at least the gas barrier properties and the moldability were low.
[0122]
<Bend Test>
          For an EVOH resin used as the EVOH layer, a bend test was performed
using a Gelbo Flex Tester in accordance with ASTM F392 (manufactured by
Brugger, KFT-C - Flex Durability Tester). The test environment was at 23'C and
50%RH.
          Firstly, a sample made from a single layer film in 28 cm x 19 cm x 30 ptm
was prepared.
          Then, a longer side of the sample was wound around a pair of mandrels
(diameter of 90 mm) arranged at an interval of 180 mm for fixation of both ends of
the sample to the pair of mandrels A and B.
          Then, while the mandrel A remained fixed, the mandrel B was gradually
brought closer while being twisted and the twist was stopped when the twisting
angle was 440 degrees and the horizontal movement distance reached 9.98 cm.
After that, the horizontal movement of the mandrel B was continued and the
horizontal movement was stopped when the horizontal movement distance after
stopping twisting reached 6.35 cm. After that, the mandrel B was returned to the
initial state by an operation opposite to above. Such operation was performed 100
times, followed by check on the presence of a pinhole. The results are indicated in
Table 3.
[0123]

                                         Number of Pinholes (number)
                                 n=1                  n=2               Average
         SF7503B                  0                    0                    0

[0124]
          SF7503B in Table 3 is an EVOH resin used for the EVOH layer in the first
structural example. Meanwhile, D2908 in Table 3 is Soarnol D2908 (model:
Soarnol SF7503B, produced by Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.),
which is a general EVOH resin. Each EVOH resin was subjected to the test twice.
[0125]
          As indicated in Table 3, by the test above, many pinholes were created in
D2908, whereas no pinhole was created at all in SF7503B and it was found that
                                           25

the latter was excellent in bending resistance more than a general EVOH resin.
[0126]
4. Fourth Experimental Example
         In the experimental example below, various delaminatable containers
having different layer structures were produced by blow molding and such
container thus obtained was filled with citrus flavored soy sauce, followed by still
standing for one week, and then the total amount of citrus flavored soy sauce in
the container was delivered for sensory evaluation of the citrus aroma in the
delivered citrus flavored soy sauce. In addition, the shape of the inner bag of the
container when the citrus flavored soy sauce is delivered was visually evaluated.
[0127]
<First Structural Example>
         In the first structural example, the layer structure was, in order from
outside the container, random copolymer layer / external EVOH layer (thickness
of 25 pm) / adhesion layer (thickness of 150 pm) / internal EVOH layer (thickness
of 15 im). The external EVOH layer was formed of an EVOH resin added to a
softening agent and the internal EVOH layer was formed of an EVOH resin not
added to a softening agent. The adhesion layer was formed of a mixture of linear
low density polyethylene and acid modified polyethylene at a mass ratio of 50:50.
According to the above evaluation, intensity of the citrus aroma emitted by the
delivered citrus flavored soy sauce was barely different. In addition, when the
inner bag shrunk with the delivery of the citrus flavored soy sauce, the inner bag
shrunk smoothly without being folded.
[0128]
<Second Structural Example>
         In the second structural example, the layer structure was same as that in
the first structural example other than changing the thickness of the internal
EVOH layer to 5 pm. According to the above evaluation, the intensity of the citrus
aroma emitted by the delivered citrus flavored soy sauce was slightly worse than
that in the first structural example. In addition, when the inner bag shrunk with
the delivery of the citrus flavored soy sauce, the inner bag shrunk smoothly
without being folded.
[0129]
<Third Structural Example>
         In the third structural example, the layer structure was same as that in
the first structural example other than changing the thickness of the internal
EVOH layer to 25 pm. According to the above evaluation, the intensity of the
citrus aroma emitted by the delivered citrus flavored soy sauce was at an
equivalent level to that in the first structural example. In addition, when the inner
bag shrunk with the delivery of the citrus flavored soy sauce, the inner bag was
prone to be folded than in the first structural example.
[0130]
<Fourth Structural Example>
         In the fourth structural example, the layer structure was same as that in
the first structural example other than changing the thickness of the external
EVOH layer to 75 pim and the thickness of the adhesion layer to 80 pm. According
to the above evaluation, the intensity of the citrus aroma emitted by the delivered
citrus flavored soy sauce was at an equivalent level to that in the first structural
example. In addition, when the inner bag shrunk with the delivery of the citrus
flavored soy sauce, the inner bag was prone to be folded than in the first
structural example.
[0131]
<First Comparative Structural Example>
                                            26

         In the first comparative structural example, the layer structure was same
as that in the first structural example other than replacing the internal EVOH
layer by a linear low density polyethylene layer (50 tm). According to the above
evaluation, the intensity of the citrus aroma emitted by the delivered citrus
flavored soy sauce was significantly worse than that in the first structural
example. In addition, when the inner bag shrunk with the delivery of the citrus
flavored soy sauce, the inner bag shrunk smoothly without being folded.
[0132]
<Second Comparative Structural Example>
         In the second comparative structural example, the layer structure was
same as that in the first structural example other than replacing the internal
EVOH layer by a polyamide layer (50 rim). According to the above evaluation, the
intensity of the citrus aroma emitted by the delivered citrus flavored soy sauce
was significantly worse than that in the first structural example. In addition,
when the inner bag shrunk with the delivery of the citrus flavored soy sauce, the
inner bag shrunk smoothly without being folded.
