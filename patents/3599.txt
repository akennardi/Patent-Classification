                                       RELATED APPLICATIONS
    [0001] The present application is a divisional of parent application 2015200832, the contents of
   which are incorporated herein by reference.
 5                                     FIELD OF THE INVENTION
    [00021 The present invention relates to ophthalmic surgical procedures and systems.
                                 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
    [0003] Cataract extraction is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in the
   world with estimated 2.5 million cases performed annually in the United States and 9.1 million
10 cases worldwide in 2000. This was expected to increase to approximately 13.3 million estimated
   global cases in 2006. This market is composed of various segments including intraocular lenses
   for   implantation,   viscoelastic   polymers    to   facilitate  surgical   maneuvers,   disposable
   instrumentation including ultrasonic phacoemulsification tips, tubing, and various knives and
   forceps.   Modem     cataract   surgery   is typically    performed    using   a technique    termed
15 phacoemulsification in which an ultrasonic tip with an associated water stream for cooling
   purposes is used to sculpt the relatively hard nucleus of the lens after performance of an opening
   in the anterior lens capsule termed anterior capsulotomy or more recently capsulorhexis.
   Following these steps as well as removal of residual softer lens cortex by aspiration methods
   without fragmentation, a synthetic foldable intraocular lens (IOLs) is inserted into the eye
20 through a small incision.
    [0004] Many cataract patients are astigmatic. Astigmatism can occur when the cornea has a
   different curvature one direction than the other. IOLs are not presently used to correct beyond
   5D    of   astigmatism,    even    though   many     patients    have   more    severe  aberrations.
   Correcting it further often involves making the corneal shape more spherical, or at least more
25 radially  symmetrical.    There have     been   numerous      approaches,  including   Corneaplasty,
   Astigmatic Keratotomy (AK), Corneal Relaxing Incisions (CRT), and Limbal Relaxing Incisions
   (LRI). All are done using manual, mechanical incisions. Presently, astigmatism cannot easily or
   predictably be corrected fully using standard techniques and approaches.
                                                      1

   About one third of those who have surgery to correct the irregularity find that their eyes regress
   to a considerable degree and only a small improvement is noted. Another third of the patients
   find that the astigmatism has been significantly reduced but not fully corrected. The remaining
   third have the most encouraging results with most or all of the desired correction achieved.
 5  [0005] What is needed are ophthalmic methods, techniques and apparatus to advance the
   standard of care of corneal shaping that may be associated with invasive cataract and other
   ophthalmic pathologies.
    [0005A] Reference to any prior art in the specification is not an acknowledgment or suggestion
   that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any jurisdiction or that this
10 prior art could reasonably be expected to be combined with other pieces of prior art by a skilled
   person in the art.
                                   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
    [0005B] In an aspect, the present invention provides a scanning system for treating target tissue
   in a patient's eye, comprising: a. an ultrafast laser source configured to deliver a laser beam
15 comprising a plurality of laser pulses; b. an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging
   device configured to generate signals used to discern a limbus and a sclera of the eye of the
   patient relative to a cornea of the eye of the patient; c. a scanner configured to focus and direct
   the laser beam in patterns within the cornea, the limbus and/or the sclera to create incisions
   therein; d. a delivery system for delivering the laser beam to the target tissue; and e. a controller
20 operatively coupled to the laser source and the scanner, characterised in that the controller is
   configured to control the scanner to adjust the position of the laser beam based upon the signals
   from the OCT device in a first pattern to form a cataract incision in the cornea, the limbus or the
   sclera, and in a second pattern to create one or more relaxation incisions in the cornea, the limbus
   or the sclera, wherein each of the relaxation incisions is a partially penetrating incision that
25 leaves an un-incised tissue thickness.
    [0006] Rapid and precise opening formation in the cornea and/or limbus are possible using a
    scanning system that implements patterned laser cutting. The patterned laser cutting improves
    accuracy and precision, while decreasing procedure time.

            DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
15  [0019]      The techniques and systems disclosed herein provide many advantages over the
   current standard of care. Specifically, rapid and precise openings in the cornea and/or
   limbus are formed using 3-dimensional patterned laser cutting. The accuracy and precision
   of the incisions are improved over traditional methods, while the duration of the procedure
   and the risk associated with creating incisions are both reduced. The present invention can
20 utilize anatomical and optical characterization and feedback to perform astigmatic
   keratotomy such as limbal and corneal relaxing incisions in conjunction with the creation of
   surgical incision that provides the surgeon access to the anterior chamber of an eye. The
   surgical incision may be made completely, or partially, depending upon the clinical
   situation. A wavefront sensor, interferometer, surface profiler, or other such device may be
25 used to yield prescriptions for correcting the astigmatism or other visual aberrations.
   Likewise, these same devices may be used to verify the surgical correction of the patterned
   scanning system, even adjusting it during the treatment procedure to produce the desired
   outcome. Furthermore, the present invention may be used in multiple sessions to coordinate
   the healing of the astigmatic correction, and drive the corrective treatment over the course

                                                   -4
     of the wound healing process. The present invention also provides for the image guided
     alignment of the incision.
     100201      There are surgical approaches provided by the present invention that enable the
     formation of very small and geometrically precise opening(s) and incision(s) in precise
  5  locations in and around the cornea and limbus. The incisions enable greater precision or
    modifications to conventional ophthalmic procedures as well as enable new procedures.
    The incision is not limited only to circular shapes but may be any shape that is conducive to
    healing or follow on procedures. These incisions might be placed such that they are able to
     seal spontaneously; or with autologous or synthetic tissue glue, photochemical bonding
 10 agent, or other such method. Furthermore, the present invention provides for the automated
    generation of incision patterns for optimal effect.
     [0021]      Another procedure enabled by the techniques described herein provides for the
    controlled formation of an incision or pattern of incisions. Conventional techniques are
    confined to areas accessible from outside the eye using mechanical cutting instruments and
 15 thus can only create incisions from anterior to posterior segments of tissue. In contrast, the
    controllable, patterned laser techniques described herein may be used to create an incision
    in virtually any position and in virtually any shape. Matching incisions may be made in
    both the anterior and posterior sections. The present invention is uniquely suited to perform
    such matching incisions.
20  [0022]       Furthermore, these incisions may be tailored to complement an asymmetric IOL
    that is being inserted as part of the procedure or has been previously inserted. The present
    invention enables the measurement of the IOL placement and subsequent automated
    calculation and generation of these complimentary corneal or limbus incisions. The
    controllable, patterned laser techniques described herein have available and/or utilize
25  precise lens measurement and other dimensional information that allows the incision or
    opening formation while minimizing impact on surrounding tissue.
    [0023]      The present invention can be implemented by a system that projects or scans an
    optical beam into a patient's eye 68, such as system 2 shown in Figure 1 which includes an
    ultrafast (LF) light source 4 (e.g. a femtosecond laser). Using this system, a beam may be
30  scanned in a patient's eye in three dimensions: X, Y, Z. In this embodiment, the UF
    wavelength can vary between 101Onm to 11 00nm and the pulse width can vary from 1OOfs

                                                   -5
     to 100Ofs. The pulse repetition frequency can also vary from 10kHz to 250kHz. Safety
     limits with regard to unintended damage to non-targeted tissue bound the upper limit with
     regard to repetition rate and pulse energy; while threshold energy, time to complete the
    procedure and stability bound the lower limit for pulse energy and repetition rate. The peak
  5 power of the focused spot in the eye 68 and specifically within the crystalline lens 69 and
     anterior capsule of the eye is sufficient to produce optical breakdown and initiate a plasma
    mediated ablation process. Near-infrared wavelengths are preferred because linear optical
     absorption and scattering in biological tissue is reduced across that spectral range. As an
     example, laser 4 may be a repetitively pulsed 1035 nm device that produces 500 fs pulses at
 10 a repetition rate of 100kHz and an individual pulse energy in the ten microjoule range.
     [0024]      The laser 4 is controlled by control electronics 300, via an input and output
    device 302, to create optical beam 6. Control electronics 300 may be a computer,
    microcontroller, etc. In this example, the entire system is controlled by the controller 300,
    and data moved through input/output device IO 302. A graphical user interface GUI 304
15  may be used to set system operating parameters, process user input (UI) 306 on the GUI
    304, and display gathered information such as images of ocular structures.
     [00251      The generated UF light beam 6 proceeds towards the patient eye 68 passing
    through half-wave plate, 8, and linear polarizer, 10. The polarization state of the beam can
    be adjusted so that the desired amount of light passes through half-wave plate 8 and linear
20  polarizer 10, which together act as a variable attenuator for the UF beam 6. Additionally,
    the orientation of linear polarizer 10 determines the incident polarization state incident upon
    beamcombiner 34, thereby optimizing beamcombiner throughput.
    [0026J       The UF beam proceeds through a shutter 12, aperture 14, and a pickoff device
    16. The system controlled shutter 12 ensures on/off control of the laser for procedural and
25  safety reasons. The aperture sets an outer useful diameter for the laser beam and the pickoff
    monitors the output of the useful beam. The pickoff device 16 includes of a partially
    reflecting mirror 20 and a detector 18. Pulse energy, average power, or a combination may
    be measured using detector 18. The information can be used for feedback to the half-wave
    plate 8 for attenuation and to verify whether the shutter 12 is open or closed. In addition,
30  the shutter 12 may have position sensors to provide a redundant state detection.

                                                 -6
    [00271     The beam passes through a beam conditioning stage 22, in which beam
   parameters such as beam diameter, divergence, circularity, and astigmatism can be
   modified. In this illustrative example, the beam conditioning stage 22 includes a 2 element
   beam expanding telescope comprised of spherical optics 24 and 26 in order to achieve the
 5 intended beam size and collimation. Although not illustrated here, an anamorphic or other
   optical system can be used to achieve the desired beam parameters. The factors used to
   determine these beam parameters include the output beam parameters of the laser, the
   overall magnification of the system, and the desired numerical aperture (NA) at the
   treatment location. In addition, the optical system 22 can be used to image aperture 14 to a
10 desired location (e.g. the center location between the 2-axis scanning device 50 described
   below). In this way, the amount of light that makes it through the aperture 14 is assured to
   make it through the scanning system. Pickoff device 16 is then a reliable measure of the
   usable light.
    [0028]     After exiting conditioning stage 22, beam 6 reflects off of fold mirrors 28, 30, &
15 32. These mirrors can be adjustable for alignment purposes. The beam 6 is then incident
   upon beam combiner 34. Beamcombiner 34 reflects the UF beam 6 (and transmits both the
   OCT 114 and aim 202 beams described below). For efficient beamcombiner operation, the
   angle of incidence is preferably kept below 45 degrees and the polarization where possible
   of the beams is fixed. For the UF beam 6, the orientation of linear polarizer 10 provides
20 fixed polarization.
    [0029]     Following the beam combiner 34, the beam 6 continues onto the z-adjust or Z
   scan device 40. In this illustrative example the z-adjust includes a Galilean telescope with
   two lens groups 42 and 44 (each lens group includes one or more lenses). Lens group 42
   moves along the z-axis about the collimation position of the telescope. In this way, the
25 focus position of the spot in the patient's eye 68 moves along the z-axis as indicated. In
   general there is a fixed linear relationship between the motion of lens 42 and the motion of
   the focus. In this case, the z-adjust telescope has an approximate 2x beam expansion ratio
   and a 1:1 relationship of the movement of lens 42 to the movement of the focus.
   Alternatively, lens group 44 could be moved along the z-axis to actuate the z-adjust, and
30 scan. The z-adjust is the z-scan device for treatment in the eye 68. It can be controlled
   automatically and dynamically by the system and selected to be independent or to interplay

                                                  -7
   with the X-Y scan device described next. Mirrors 36 and 38 can be used for aligning the
   optical axis with the axis of z-adjust device 40.
   [00301       After passing through the z-adjust device 40, the beam 6 is directed to the x-y
   scan device by mirrors 46 & 48. Mirrors 46 & 48 can be adjustable for alignment purposes.
 5 X-Y scanning is achieved by the scanning device 50 preferably using two mirrors 52 & 54
   under the control of control electronics 300, which rotate in orthogonal directions using
   motors, galvanometers, or any other well known optic moving device. Mirrors 52 & 54 are
   located near the telecentric position of the objective lens 58 and contact lens 66 combination
   described below. Tilting these mirrors 52/54 causes them to deflect beam 6, causing lateral
10 displacements in the plane of UF focus located in the patient's eye 68. Objective lens 58
   may be a complex multi-element lens element, as shown, and represented by lenses 60, 62,
   and 64. The complexity of the lens 58 will be dictated by the scan field size, the focused
   spot size, the available working distance on both the proximal and distal sides of objective
   58, as well as the amount of aberration control. An f-theta lens 58 of focal length 60mm
15 generating a spot size of 10 im, over a field of 10mm, with an input beam size of 15mm
   diameter is an example. Alternatively, X-Y scanning by scanner 50 may be achieved by
   using one or more moveable optical elements (e.g. lenses, gratings) which also may be
   controlled by control electronics 300, via input and output device 302.
   [00311       The aiming and treatment scan patterns can be automatically generated by the
20 scanner 50 under the control of controller 300. Such patterns may be comprised of a single
   spot of light, multiple spots of light, a continuous pattern of light, multiple continuous
   patterns of light, and/or any combination of these. In addition, the aiming pattern (using
   aim beam 202 described below) need not be identical to the treatment pattern (using light
   beam 6), but preferably at least defines its boundaries in order to assure that the treatment
25 light is delivered only within the desired target area for patient safety. This may be done,
   for example, by having the aiming pattern provide an outline of the intended treatment
   pattern. This way the spatial extent of the treatment pattern may be made known to the
   user, if not the exact locations of the individual spots themselves, and the scanning thus
   optimized for speed, efficiency and accuracy. The aiming pattern may also be made to be
30 perceived as blinking in order to further enhance its visibility to the user.

                                                  -8
    [00321     An optional contact lens 66, which can be any suitable ophthalmic lens, can be
   used to help further focus the optical beam 6 into the patient's eye 68 while helping to
   stabilize eye position. The positioning and character of optical beam 6 and/or the scan
   pattern the beam 6 forms on the eye 68 may be further controlled by use of an input device
 5 such as a joystick, or any other appropriate user input device (e.g. GUI 304) to position the
   patient and/or the optical system.
    [0033]     The UF laser 4 and controller 300 can be set to target the surfaces of the targeted
   structures in the eye 68 and ensure that the beam 6 will be focused where appropriate and
   not unintentionally damage non-targeted tissue. Imaging modalities and techniques
10 described herein, such as for example, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Purkinje
   imaging, Scheimpflug imaging, or ultrasound may be used to determine the location and
   measure the thickness of the lens and lens capsule to provide greater precision to the laser
   focusing methods, including 2D and 3D patterning. Laser focusing may also be
   accomplished using one or more methods including direct observation of an aiming beam,
15 Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Purkinje imaging, Scheimpflug imaging,
   ultrasound, or other known ophthalmic or medical imaging modalities and/or combinations
   thereof. In the embodiment of Figure 1, an OCT device 100 is described, although other
   modalities are within the scope of the present invention. An OCT scan of the eye will
   provide information about the axial location of the anterior and posterior lens capsule, the
20 boundaries of the cataract nucleus, as well as the depth of the anterior chamber. This
   information is then be loaded into the control electronics 300, and used to program and
   control the subsequent laser-assisted surgical procedure. The information may also be used
   to determine a wide variety of parameters related to the procedure such as, for example, the
   upper and lower axial limits of the focal planes used for cutting the lens capsule and
25 segmentation of the lens cortex and nucleus, and the thickness of the lens capsule among
   others.
   [0034]      The OCT device 100 in Figure 1 includes a broadband or a swept light source
   102 that is split by a fiber coupler 104 into a reference arm 106 and a sample arm 110. The
   reference arm 106 includes a module 108 containing a reference reflection along with
30 suitable dispersion and path length compensation. The sample arm 110 of the OCT device
   100 has an output connector 112 that serves as an interface to the rest of the UF laser
   system. The return signals from both the reference and sample arms 106, 110 are then

                                                  -9
     directed by coupler 104 to a detection device 128, which employs either time domain,
     frequency or single point detection techniques. In Figure 1, a frequency domain technique
    is used with an OCT wavelength of 920nm and bandwidth of 100nm.
     [0035]      Exiting connector 112, the OCT beam 114 is collimated using lens 116. The
  5  size of the collimated beam 114 is determined by the focal length of lens 116. The size of
     the beam 114 is dictated by the desired NA at the focus in the eye and the magnification of
     the beam train leading to the eye 68. Generally, OCT beam 114 does not require as high an
    NA as the UF beam 6 in the focal plane and therefore the OCT beam 114 is smaller in
     diameter than the UF beam 6 at the beamcombiner 34 location. Following collimating lens
 10  116 is aperture 118 which further modifies the resultant NA of the OCT beam 114 at the
     eye. The diameter of aperture 118 is chosen to optimize OCT light incident on the target
    tissue and the strength of the return signal. Polarization control element 120, which may be
    active or dynamic, is used to compensate for polarization state changes which may be
    induced by individual differences in corneal birefringence, for example. Mirrors 122 & 124
15  are then used to direct the OCT beam 114 towards beamcombiners 126 & 34. Mirrors 122
    & 124 may be adjustable for alignment purposes and in particular for overlaying of OCT
    beam 114 to UF beam 6 subsequent to beamcombiner 34. Similarly, beamcombiner 126 is
    used to combine the OCT beam 114 with the aim beam 202 described below.
     [0036]      Once combined with the UF beam 6 subsequent to beamcombiner 34, OCT
20  beam 114 follows the same path as UF beam 6 through the rest of the system. In this way,
    OCT beam 114 is indicative of the location of UF beam 6. OCT beam 114 passes through
    the z-scan 40 and x-y scan 50 devices then the objective lens 58 , contact lens 66 and on
    into the eye 68. Reflections and scatter off of structures within the eye provide return
    beams that retrace back through the optical system, into connector 112, through coupler
25   104, and to OCT detector 128. These return back reflections provide the OCT signals that
    are in turn interpreted by the system as to the location in X, Y Z of UF beam 6 focal
    location.
    [00371       OCT device 100 works on the principle of measuring differences in optical path
    length between its reference and sample arms. Therefore, passing the OCT through z-adjust
30  40 does not extend the z-range of OCT system 100 because the optical path length does not
    change as a function of movement of 42. OCT system 100 has an inherent z-range that is

                                                  -10
     related to the detection scheme, and in the case of frequency domain detection it is
     specifically related to the spectrometer and the location of the reference arm 106. In the
     case of OCT system 100 used in Figure 1, the z-range is approximately 1-2mm in an
     aqueous environment. Extending this range to at least 4mm involves the adjustment of the
  5  path length of the reference arm within OCT system 100. Passing the OCT beam 114 in the
     sample arm through the z-scan of z-adjust 40 allows for optimization of the OCT signal .
     strength. This is accomplished by focusing the OCT beam 114 onto the targeted structure
     while accommodating the extended optical path length by commensurately increasing the
     path within the reference arm 106 of OCT system 100.
 10  [0038]      Because of the fundamental differences in the OCT measurement with respect to
     the UF focus device due to influences such as immersion index, refraction, and aberration,
    both chromatic and monochromatic, care must be taken in analyzing the OCT signal with
     respect to the UF beam focal location. A calibration or registration procedure as a function
     of X, Y Z should be conducted in order to match the OCT signal information to the UF
15   focus location and also to the relate to absolute dimensional quantities.
     [00391      Observation of an aim beam may also be used to assist the user to directing the
    UF laser focus. Additionally, an aim beam visible to the unaided eye in lieu of the infrared
    OCT and UF beams can be helpful with alignment provided the aim beam accurately
    represents the infrared beam parameters. An aim subsystem 200 is employed in the
20  configuration shown in Figure 1. The aim beam 202 is generated by a an aim beam light
    source 201, such as a helium-neon laser operating at a wavelength of 633nm. Alternatively
    a laser diode in the 630-650nm range could be used. The advantage of using the helium
    neon 633nm beam is its long coherence length, which would enable the use of the aim path
    as a laser unequal path interferometer (LUPI) to measure the optical quality of the beam
25  train, for example.
    [00401       Once the aim beam light source generates aim beam 202, the aim beam 202 is
    collimated using lens 204. The size of the collimated beam is determined by the focal
    length of lens 204. The size of the aim beam 202 is dictated by the desired NA at the focus
    in the eye and the magnification of the beam train leading to the eye 68. Generally, aim
30  beam 202 should have close to the same NA as UF beam 6 in the focal plane and therefore
    aim beam 202 is of similar diameter to the UF beam at the beamcombiner 34 location.

                                                -11
   Because the aim beam is meant to stand-in for the UF beam 6 during system alignment to
   the target tissue of the eye, much of the aim path mimics the UF path as described
   previously. The aim beam 202 proceeds through a half-wave plate 206 and linear polarizer
   208. The polarization state of the aim beam 202 can be adjusted so that the desired amount
 5 of light passes through polarizer 208. Elements 206 & 208 therefore act as a variable
   attenuator for the aim beam 202. Additionally, the orientation of polarizer 208 determines
   the incident polarization state incident upon beamcombiners 126 and 34, thereby fixing the
   polarization state and allowing for optimization of the beamcombiners' throughput. Of
   course, if a semiconductor laser is used as aim beam light source 200, the drive current can
10 be varied to adjust the optical power.
    [00411      The aim beam 202 proceeds through a shutter 210 and aperture 212. The system
   controlled shutter 210 provides on/off control of the aim beam 202. The aperture 212 sets
   an outer useful diameter for the aim beam 202 and can be adjusted appropriately. A
   calibration procedure measuring the output of the aim beam 202 at the eye can be used to
15 set the attenuation of aim beam 202 via control of polarizer 206.
    [0042]      The aim beam 202 next passes through a beam conditioning device 214. Beam
   parameters such as beam diameter, divergence, circularity, and astigmatism can be modified
   using one or more well known beaming conditioning optical elements. In the case of an
   aim beam 202 emerging from an optical fiber, the beam conditioning device 214 can simply
20 include a beam expanding telescope with two optical elements 216 and 218 in order to
   achieve the intended beam size and collimation. The final factors used to determine the aim
   beam parameters such as degree of collimation are dictated by what is necessary to match
   the UF beam 6 and aim beam 202 at the location of the eye 68. Chromatic differences can
   be taken into account by appropriate adjustments of beam conditioning device 214. In
25 addition, the optical system 214 is used to image aperture 212 to a desired location such as a
   conjugate location of aperture 14.
   [0043]       The aim beam 202 next reflects off of fold mirrors 222 & 220, which are
   preferably adjustable for alignment registration to UF beam 6 subsequent to beam combiner
   34. The aim beam 202 is then incident upon beam combiner 126 where the aim beam 202 is
30 combined with OCT beam 114. Beamcombiner 126 reflects the aim beam 202 and
   transmits the OCT beam 114, which allows for efficient operation of the beamcombining

                                                 -12
   functions at both wavelength ranges. Alternatively, the transmit and reflect functions of
   beamcombiner 126 can be reversed and the configuration inverted. Subsequent to
   beamcombiner 126, aim beam 202 along with OCT beam 114 is combined with UF beam 6
   by beamcombiner 34.
 5  [0044]      A device for imaging the target tissue on or within the eye 68 is shown
   schematically in Figure 1 as imaging system 71. Imaging system includes a camera 74 and
   an illumination light source 86 for creating an image of the target tissue. The imaging
   system 71 gathers images which may be used by the system controller 300 for providing
   pattern centering about or within a predefined structure. The illumination light source 86 for
10 the viewing is generally broadband and incoherent. For example, light source 86 can
   include multiple LEDs as shown. The wavelength of the viewing light source 86 is
   preferably in the range of 700nm to 750nm, but can be anything which is accommodated by
   the beamcombiner 56, which combines the viewing light with the beam path for UF beam 6
   and aim beam 202 (beamcombiner 56 reflects the viewing wavelengths while transmitting
15 the OCT and UF wavelengths). The beamcombiner 56 may partially transmit the aim
   wavelength so that the aim beam 202 can be visible to the viewing camera 74. Optional
   polarization element 84 in front of light source 86 can be a linear polarizer, a quarter wave
   plate, a half-wave plate or any combination, and is used to optimize signal. A false color
   image as generated by the near infrared wavelength is acceptable.
20  [0045]      The illumination light from light source 86 is directed down towards the eye
   using the same objective lens 58 and contact lens 66 as the UF and aim beam 6, 202. The
   light reflected and scattered off of various structures in the eye 68 are collected by the same
   lenses 58 & 66 and directed back towards beamcombiner 56. There, the return light is
   directed back into the viewing path via beam combiner and mirror 82, and on to camera 74.
25 Camera 74 can be, for example but not limited to, any silicon based detector array of the
   appropriately sized format. Video lens 76 forms an image onto the camera's detector array
   while optical elements 80 & 78 provide polarization control and wavelength filtering
   respectively. Aperture or iris 81 provides control of imaging NA and therefore depth of
   focus and depth of field. A small aperture provides the advantage of large depth of field
30 which aids in the patient docking procedure. Alternatively, the illumination and camera
   paths can be switched. Furthermore, aim light source 200 can be made to emit in the

                                                 -13
   infrared which would not directly visible, but could be captured and displayed using
   imaging system 71.
    [0046]     Coarse adjust registration is usually needed so that when the contact lens 66
   comes into contact with the cornea, the targeted structures are in the capture range of the X,
 5 Y scan of the system. Therefore a docking procedure is preferred, which preferably takes in
   account patient motion as the system approaches the contact condition (i.e. contact between
   the patient's eye 68 and the contact lens 66. The viewing system 71 is configured so that
   the depth of focus is large enough such that the patient's eye 68 and other salient features
   may be seen before the contact lens 66 makes contact with eye 68.
10  [0047]     Preferably, a motion control system 70 is integrated into the overall control
   system 2, and may move the patient, the system 2 or elements thereof, or both, to achieve
   accurate and reliable contact between contact lens 66 and eye 68. Furthermore, a vacuum
   suction subsystem and flange may be incorporated into system 2, and used to stabilize eye
   68. The alignment of eye 68 to system 2 via contact lens 66 may be accomplished while
15 monitoring the output of imaging system 71, and performed manually or automatically by
   analyzing the images produced by imaging system 71 electronically by means of control
   electronics 300 via 10 302. Force and/or pressure sensor feedback may also be used to
   discern contact, as well as to initiate the vacuum subsystem.
   [0048]      An alternative beamcombining configuration is shown in the alternate
20 embodiment of Figure 2. For example, the passive beamcombiner 34 in Figure 1 can be
   replaced with an active combiner 140 in Figure 2. The active beamcombiner 34 can be a
   moving or dynamically controlled element such as a galvanometric scanning mirror, as
   shown. Active combiner 140 changes it angular orientation in order to direct either the UF
   bean! 6 or the combined aim and OCT beams 202,114 towards the scanner 50 and
25 eventually eye 68 one at a time. The advantage of the active combining technique is that it
   avoids the difficulty of combining beams with similar wavelength ranges or polarization
   states using a passive beam combiner. This ability is traded off against the ability to have
   simultaneous beams in time and potentially less accuracy and precision due to positional
   tolerances of active beam combiner 140.
30 [0049]      Another alternate embodiment is shown in Figure 3 which is similar to that of
   Figure 1 but utilizes an alternate approach to OCT 100. In Figure 3, OCT 101 is the same

                                                -14
   as OCT 100 in Figure 1, except that the reference arm 106 has been replaced by reference
   arm 132. This free-space OCT reference arm 132 is realized by including beamsplitter 130
   after lens 116. The reference beam 132 then proceeds through polarization controlling
   element 134 and then onto the reference return module 136. The reference return module
 5  136 contains the appropriate dispersion and path length adjusting and compensating
   elements and generates an appropriate reference signal for interference with the sample
   signal. The sample arm of OCT 101 now originates subsequent to beamsplitter 130. The
   potential advantages of this free space configuration include separate polarization control
   and maintenance of the reference and sample arms. The fiber based beam splitter 104 of
10 OCT 101 can also be replaced by a fiber based circulator. Alternately, both OCT detector
    128 and beamsplitter 130 might be moved together as opposed to reference arm 136.
    [00501      Figure 4 shows another alternative embodiment for combining OCT beam 114
   and UF beam 6. In Figure 4, OCT 156 (which can include either of the configurations of
   OCT 100 or 101) is configured such that its OCT beam 154 is coupled to UF beam 6 after
15 the z-scan 40 using beamcombiner 152. In this way, OCT beam 154 avoids using the z
   adjust. This allows the OCT 156 to possibly be folded into the beam more easily and
   shortening the path length for more stable operation. This OCT configuration is at the
   expense of an optimized signal return strength as discussed with respect to Figure 1. There
   are many possibilities for the configuration of the OCT interferometer, including time and
20 frequency domain approaches, single and dual beam methods, swept source, etc, as
   described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,748,898; 5,748,352; 5,459,570; 6,111,645; and 6,053,613
   (which are incorporated herein by reference.)
   [00511       The present invention provides for creating the incision to allow access for the
   lens removal instrumentation, typically referred to as the "cataract incision." This is shown
25 as cataract incision 402 on the patient's eye 68 illustrated in Figures 5A & 5B. In these
   figures cataract incision 402 is made to eye 68 to provide access to crystalline lens 412
   through cornea 406 while pupil 404 is dilated. The incision 402 is shown in comea 406, but
   could be alternately placed in limbus 408 or sclera 410. The incision may be made with
   adjustable arcuate dimensions (both radius and extent), radial orientation and depth. A
30 complete cut may not be desirable in all situations, such as in an unsterile field where
   opening the eye to the environment poses further risks of endophthalmitis, for example. In
   this case, the present invention may provide a cataract incision that only partially penetrates

                                                 -15
    cornea 406, limbus 408 and/or sclera 410. The resident imaging apparati in system 2 may
   also provide input for planning the incision. For example, imaging system 71 and/or OCT
    100 could identify the limbal boundary, and guide the incision to follow it along at a
   predetermined depth. Furthermore, surgeons often have difficulty in starting the incision at
 5  the correct location relative to limbus 410 when employing cold steel techniques, as well as
   keeping the knife straight to avoid incisions that ultimately penetrate both cornea 406 and
    sclera 410. Such angled incisions prove more likely to have torn edges and significantly
   higher risks of endophthalmitis.
    [00521      The present invention may make use of the integrated OCT system 100 to
10 discern limbus 408 and sclera 410 relative to cornea 406 by virtue of the large optical
   scattering differences between them. These can be directly imaged using OCT device 100,
   and the location of the transition (limbus 408) from clear (cornea 406) to scattering (sclera
   410) can be determined and used by CPU 300 of system 2 to guide the placement of the
   laser-created incisions. The scanner position values corresponding to this transition define
15 the location of limbus 408. Thus, once registered to each other, OCT 100 can guide the
   position of beam 6 relative to limbus 408. This same imaging approach may be used to
   discern the thickness of the tissue, as well. Thus, the depth of the incisions and their
   disposition within the tissue may be precisely defined. With that in mind, the choice of
   wavelength for OCT device 100 preferably accounts for the requirement of scleral
20 measurement. Wavelengths in the range of 800 - 1400 nm are especially suited for this, as
   they are less scattered in tissue (and penetrate to depths of -1mm) while not suffering from
   linear optical absorption by water or other tissue constituents that would otherwise diminish
   their performance.
   [00531       Standard cataract incisions typically require ~30* of limbal angle as seen from
25 directly above the eye. Such incisions have been shown to induce from 0-1.01D of
   astigmatism, on average. Thus, achieving postoperative emmetropia can be made more
   difficult. To address astigmatism, the present invention may also produce Astigmatic
   Kerototomy (AK) incisions. Such incisions are routinely used to correct astigmatism by
   relaxing an asymmetrically shaped cornea along its steep axis. Similar to the cataract
30 incision, such relaxing incisions (RIs) must be accurately placed along or nearby the limbus
   and are known as Limbal Relaxing Incisions (LRIs). Relaxing incisions, however, are only
   partially penetrating incisions. They should leave at least 200pm of tissue thickness in

                                                   -16
    order to maintain its ongoing structural integrity. Similarly, Corneal Relaxing Incisions
     (CRIs) are incisions that are placed anterior to the limbus in the clear corneal tissue to serve
    the same clinical purpose of astigmatic correction. In addition to the specific clinical
    details, the circumferential orientation and angular extent are also influenced by the cataract
  5 incision. Thus, with the present invention, the RIs may be planned and executed in
    conjunction with the cataract incision to achieve a better visual correction than otherwise
    possible. To optimize the entire treatment, the cataract incision should not be placed at or
    near the steep axis of the cornea. If it is, only one RI is traditionally recommended. There
    are a variety of nomograms based upon empirical observations that are currently used by
 10 clinicians to prescribe the placement and extent of RIs. These include, but are not limited
    to, the Donnenfeld, Gills, Nichamin, and Koch nomograms.
     [0054]      Figure 6 illustrates system 2 as shown in Figure 1, but with a sub-system to
    characterize the astigmatism of the patient's cornea. Specifically, a profilometer 415 distal
    to X-Y scanner 50 is included to allow for a continuous unobstructed view of the cornea of
15  patient's eye 68. Profilometer 415 and its sensor 417 are added to system 2 via
    beamcombiner 419 and are connected as shown in Figure 6 to the system controller 300
    through input/output bus 302. As compared to the configuration described in Figure 1, in
    this embodiment, contact lens 66 or its disposition relative to cornea 406 of eye 68 may
    have to be modified, or compensated for, to suit the profilometer's mode of operation. This
20  is because profilometer 415 requires the cornea to be in its natural state, not forced into
    contact with a surface and possibly conforming to its shape, to accurately measure cornea
    406 and provide data to system 2 for calculation and registration via input/output bus 302
    and control electronics 300. Alternately, contact lens 66 may be removed from contact with
    the eye, and the diagnostic and therapeutic portions of system 2 made to traverse gap 421 to
25  eye 68 as shown in Figure 9. The change in relationship between eye 68 and system 2
    made by removing contact lens 66 must then be accounted for in ranging and registration of
    beams 6, 114, and 202. The use of OCT 100 to discern the location and shape of cornea
    406 is especially useful in this regard, as the reflection from cornea 406 will provide a very
    strong signal making registration straight forward.
30  [00551      In this embodiment, profilometer 415 may be used to prescribe an astigmatic
    keratotomy to correct the shape of a patient's cornea to diminish its astigmatism. The
    profilometer 415 may be a placido system, triangulation system, laser displacement sensor,

                                                  -17
    interferometer, or other such device, which measures the corneal topography also known as
    the surface profile or the surface sag (i.e. sagitta) of the cornea as a function of the
    transverse dimension to some defined axis. This axis is typically the visual axis of the eye
   but can also be the optical axis of the cornea. Alternately, profilometer 415 may be
 5  replaced by a wavefront sensor to more fully optically characterize the patient's eye. A
    wavefront sensing system measures the aberration of the eye's optical system. A common
    technique for accomplishing this task is a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, which
   measures the shape of the wavefronts of light (surfaces of constant phase) that exit the eye's
   pupil. If the eye were a perfect optical system, these wavefronts would be perfectly flat.
10  Since the eye is not perfect, the wavefronts are not flat and have irregular curved shapes. A
    Shack-Hartmann sensor divides up the incoming beam and its overall wavefront into sub
   beams, dividing up the wavefront into separate facets, each focused by a microlens onto a
    subarray of detection pixels. Depending upon where the focal spot from each facet strikes
   its subarray of pixels, it is then possible to determine the local wavefront inclination (or tilt).
15  Subsequent analysis of all facets together leads to determination of the overall wavefront
    form. These deviations from the perfectly overall flat wavefront are indicative of the
   localized corrections that can be made in the corneal surface. The measurements of the
   wavefront sensor may be used by controller 300 to automatically prescribe an astigmatic
   keratotomy via predictive algorithms resident in the system, as mentioned above.
20  [0056]      Figure 7 shows a possible configuration of such an astigmatic keratotomy. In
   this example, eye 68 is shown and a set of relaxing incisions RI 420 are made at locations
   within the area of the cornea 406. Likewise, as is known in the art, such relaxing incisions
   may be made in the limbus 408, or sclera 410. Astigmatism is present when the cornea is
   not spherical; that is, it is steeper in one meridian than other (orthogonal) meridian.
25 Determining the nature of the corneal shape is important, whether the astigmatism is "with
   the-rule," "against-the-rule," or oblique. In "with-the-rule" astigmatism, the vertical
   meridian is steeper than the horizontal meridian; in "against-the-rule" astigmatism, the
   horizontal meridian is steeper than the vertical meridian. Limbal relaxing incisions (LRIs)
   are a modification of astigmatic keratotomy (AK), a procedure to treat astigmatism. LRIs
30 are placed on the far peripheral aspect of the cornea (the limbus), resulting in a more
   rounded cornea. Astigmatism is reduced, and uncorrected vision is improved. LRIs can
   correct astigmatism up to 8 diopters (D); however, the use of LRIs is presently routinely

                                                  -18
   reserved for corrections of 0.5-4 D of astigmatism. Although LRIs are a weaker corrective
   procedure compared to corneal relaxing incisions (CRIs), LRIs produce less postoperative
   glare and less patient discomfort. In addition, these incisions heal faster. Unlike CRIs,
   making the incision at the limbus preserves the perfect optical qualities of the cornea. LRIs
 5 are also a more forgiving procedure, and surgeons often get excellent results, even with
   early cases.
    [00571       The desired length, number, and depth of relaxing incisions 420 can be
   determined using nomograms. A starting point nomogram can titrate surgery by length and
   number of LRIs. However, the length and placement can vary based on topography and
10 other factors. The goal is to reduce cylindrical optical power and to absolutely avoid
   overcorrecting with-the-rule astigmatism, because against-the-rule astigmatism should be
   minimized. Relaxing incisions formed in the sclera, limbus, or cornea are generally used
   for cases of with-the-rule astigmatism and low against-the-rule astigmatism. When using the
   relaxing incision in conjunction with against-the-rule astigmatism, the LRI can be moved
15 slightly into the cornea, or, alternatively, the LRI could be placed opposite another relaxing
   incision in the sclera, limbus or cornea. For patients who have with-the-rule astigmatism or
   oblique astigmatism, the relaxing incision is made temporally, and the LRIs are placed at
   the steep axis. The placement of the LRI should be customized to the topography of the
   cornea. In cases of asymmetric astigmatism, the LRI in the steepest axis can be elongated
20 slightly and then shortened the same amount in the flatter of the 2 steep axes. Paired LRIs
   do not have to be made in the same meridian. Patients with low (<1.5 D) against-the-rule
   astigmatism receive only a single LRI in the steep meridian, placed opposite to the cataract
   incision. However, if astigmatism is greater than 1.5 D, a pair of LRIs should be used. In
   against-the-rule astigmatism cases, one pair of LRIs may be incorporated into the cataract
25 incision. The length of the LRI is not affected by the presence of the cataract incision. This
   is difficult to perform precisely with present methods. In low with-the-rule astigmatism
   cases, a single 6-mm LRI (0.6 mm in depth) is made at 90*. The LRI can be independent of
   the cataract incision in with-the-rule astigmatism cases (if the cataract incision is temporal
   and the LRI is superior).
30 [0058]       Furthermore, unlike traditional cold steel surgical approaches to creating
   incisions that must start at the outside and cut inwards, using a light source for making these
   incisions allows for RI 420 to be made from the inside out and thus better preserve the

                                                  -19
   structural integrity of the tissue and limit the risk of tearing and infection. Moreover, the
   cataract incision 402 and the relaxation incision(s) 420 can be made automatically using the
   imaging and scanning features of system 2. A pair of treatment pattems can be generated
   that forms incisions 402 and 420, thus providing more accurate control over the absolute
 5 and relative positioning of these incisions. The pair of treatment patterns can be applied
   sequentially, or simultaneously (i.e. the pair of treatment patterns can be combined into a
   single treatment pattern that forms both types of incisions). For proper alignment of the
   treatment beam pattern, an aiming beam and/or pattern from system 2 can be first projected
   onto the target tissue with visible light indicating where the treatment pattern(s) will be
10 projected. This allows the surgeon to adjust and confirm the size, location and shape of the
   treatment pattern(s) before their actual application. Thereafter, the two or three dimensional
   treatment pattern(s) can be rapidly applied to the target tissue using the scanning capabilities
   of system 2.
   [0059]       Specialized scan patterns for creating alternate geometries for cataract incisions
15 402 that are not achievable using conventional techniques are also possible. An example is
   illustrated in Figure 8. A cross-sectional view of an alternate geometry for cataract incision
   402 is shown to have a bevel feature 430. Bevel feature 430 may be useful for wound
   healing, sealing, or locking. Such 3-dimensional cataract incisions 402 can be achieved
   accurately and quickly utilizing the 3-dimensional scanning ability of system 2. Although a
20 beveled incision is shown, many such geometries are enabled using the present invention,
   and within its scope. As before, the incision 402 is shown in cornea 406, but could be
   alternately placed in limbus 408 or sclera 410.
   [0060]       For large fields as when incisions are made in the outer most regions such as the
   limbus or sclera, a specialized contact lens can be used. This contact lens could be in the
25 form of a gonioscopic mirror or lens. The lens does not need to be diametrically symmetric.
   Just one portion of the lens can be extended to reach the outer regions of the eye such as the
   limbus 408 and sclera 410. Any targeted location can be reached by the proper rotation of
   the specialized lens.
   [0061]       It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the
30 embodiment(s) described above and illustrated herein, but encompasses any and all
   variations falling within the scope of the appended claims. For example, references to the

                                              -20
  present invention herein are not intended to limit the scope of any claim or claim term, but
  instead merely make reference to one or more features that may be covered by one or more
  of the claims. All the optical elements downstream of scanner 50 shown in Figs. 1, 3 and 4
  form a delivery system of optical elements for delivering the beam 6, 114 and 202 to the
5 target tissue. Conceivably, depending on the desired features of the system, some or even
  most of the depicted optical elements could be omitted in a delivery system that still reliably
  delivers the scanned beams to the target tissue.

   CLAIMS
   1. A scanning system for treating target tissue in a patient's eye, comprising:
         a. an ultrafast laser source configured to deliver a laser beam comprising a plurality of laser
   pulses;
 5       b. an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging device configured to generate
   signals used to discern a limbus and a sclera of the eye of the patient relative to a cornea of the
   eye of the patient;
         c. a scanner configured to focus and direct the laser beam in patterns within the cornea, the
   limbus and/or the sclera to create incisions therein;
10       d. a delivery system for delivering the laser beam to the target tissue; and
         e. a controller operatively coupled to the laser source and the scanner, characterised in that
   the controller is configured to control the scanner to adjust the position of the laser beam based
   upon the signals from the OCT device in a first pattern to form a cataract incision in the cornea,
   the limbus or the sclera, and in a second pattern to create one or more relaxation incisions in the
15 cornea, the limbus or the sclera, wherein each of the relaxation incisions is a partially penetrating
   incision that leaves an un-incised tissue thickness.
   2. The system of claim 1, further comprising a profilometer for measuring a surface profile of the
   cornea of the patient's eye, wherein the measured corneal surface profile is used to define the
   patterns so as to treat astigmatism of the patient's eye.
20 3. The system of claim 2, wherein the profilometer is disposed distal to the scanner to allow for a
   continuous unobstructed view of the cornea of the patient's eye.
   4. The system of claim 1, further comprising a wavefront sensor to optically characterize the
   patient's eye, wherein measurements of the patient's eye made by the wavefront sensor are used
   to define the patterns so as to treat astigmatism of the patient's eye.
25 5. The system of any of the preceding claims, wherein the laser source and scanner are
   configured to incise the cataract incision at a depth based upon the signals generated by the OCT
   device.
                                                     21

   6. The system of any of the preceding claims, wherein the one or more relaxation incisions
   comprises a plurality of discrete incisions within at least one of the limbus and the sclera of the
   patient's eye.
   7. The system of any of the preceding claims, wherein:
 5       the signals from the OCT device include imaging data for the limbus; and
         the imaging data is processed to determine the location of the limbus.
   8. The system of any of the preceding claims, wherein at least one of the one or more relaxation
   incisions is incised starting from the inside and proceeding outward.
   9. The system of any of the preceding claims, wherein the scanner includes an X-Y scan device
10 and a Z-scan device, the Z-scan device being operable to move a focal spot of the laser beam
   along a z-axis that is substantially aligned with the laser beam, the X-Y scan device being
   operable to move the focus position laterally to the z-axis, wherein the laser beam propagates
   through the Z-scan device prior to propagating through the X-Y scan device.
