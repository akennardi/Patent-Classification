                         AN ENCLOSURE FOR A SWITCHBOARD
Technical Field
[01]    The present invention relates to enclosures and in particular, although not exclusively,
this invention relates to an enclosure for a switchboard, which allows convenient removal of
a front panel.
Background
[021    At a construction or renovation site electric tools (for example, an electric drill) are
used to perform a construction or renovation task. Electricity energy that powers the electric
tools is supplied through a switchboard, which is normally installed at the site temporarily.
The switchboard typically includes an enclosure and electronic devices (for example, sockets,
circuit breakers, switches, etc.) that installed in the enclosure. The enclosure typically
includes a front panel, a back panel and a plurality of side panels. These panels define a space
in which the electronic devices are installed. The back panel is normally used to fix the
enclosure to a stand that supports the switchboard. The front panel can be opened to allow a
worker to access the electronic devices such as a socket installed in the enclosure. The front
panel can also be closed to disable access to the electronic devices.
[031    However, at the construction or renovation site, it is not always possible to place the
front panel of the enclosure at the open position. For example, when multiple switchboards
are positioned close to each other, there is no sufficient space between the switchboards to
open the front panel of the enclosure of a switchboard that is sandwiched between two other
switchboards. This makes it inconvenient for workers to access electronic devices installed in
the enclosure of the switchboard.
[04]    Accordingly, there is a need for an improved enclosure for a switchboard which does
not suffer from above mentioned deficiencies.
[05]    Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the words
"comprise", "comprises" and "comprising" will be understood to imply the inclusion of a
stated step or element or group of steps or elements but not the exclusion of any other step or
element or group of steps or elements.

                                                  2
[061     Any one of the terms: "including" or "which includes" or "that includes" as used
herein is also an open term that also means including at least the elements/features that follow
the term, but not excluding others.
[071     Any discussion of the background art throughout the specification should in no way
be considered as an admission that such background art is prior art nor that such background
art is widely known or forms part of the common general knowledge in the field in Australia
or worldwide.
Summary
[081     There is provided an enclosure for a switchboard, the enclosure comprising a back
panel having a first side edge, a second side edge, a third side edge and a fourth side edge; a
first side panel extending from the first side edge of the back panel; a second side panel
extending from the second side edge of the back panel; a third side panel extending from the
third side edge of the back panel; a fourth side panel extending from the fourth side edge of
the back panel and forming a front edge; the fourth side panel being adjacent to the first side
panel and the second side panel; an engagement member having a first part and a second part,
the first part of the engagement member being securely fixed to the fourth side panel, wherein
the second part is configured to be pivotable relative to the first part and further configured to
slide relative to the first part along a direction of the front edge of the fourth side panel to
allow engagement with and disengagement from the first part along the direction of the front
edge of the fourth side panel; and a front panel securely fixed to the second part of the
engagement member.
[09]     It is an advantage of the present invention that the second part of the engagement
member is configured to be pivotable relative to the first part and further configured to slide
relative to the first part along the direction of the front edge of the fourth side panel to allow
engagement with and disengagement from the first part along the direction of the front edge.
This way. the front panel may be removed from the enclosure by sliding along the direction
of the front edge of the fourth side panel even if the front panel is in a closed position in order
for a worker to access the electronic devices installed in the enclosure. This is highly
desirable when there are multiple switchboards placed close to each other and there is no
sufficient space available to open the front panel of the enclosure of the switchboard if the
switchboard is sandwiched between two other switchboards.

part of the engagement member may include an elongate hollow member configured to
slidely and pivotably receive the elongate pin therein.
[015]   The movement limiter may be a bolt and the fourth side panel may include a hole with
a thread to detachably connect the bolt to the fourth side panel via the thread.
[016]   The hole may be located at a position where if the bolt is screwed into the fourth side
panel, the bolt disables the disengagement of the second part of the engagement member
from the first part of the engagement member.
[017]   The enclosure may further comprise a support base secured to the back panel, the
support base having a first section of a first height and a second section of a second height
and being configured to allow electronic devices of different heights to be installed thereon.
[018]   The enclosure may further comprise a support bar having a first end and a second end,
the first end being configured to pivotably connect to one of the first side panel and the
second side panel, and the second end being configured to releasably connect to the front
panel.
[019]   The enclosure may further comprise a first support member installed on the first side
panel, a second support member installed on the second side panel and a separation panel
between the first side panel and the second side panel, the separation panel being configured
to detachably connect to the first support member and the second support member, and allow
the electronic devices to be installed between the separation panel and the support base.

                                                  4
[020]   The separation panel may further include at least one opening, the least one opening
being sized to enable access to the electronic devices.
[021]   The separation panel may further include a cover that is hingedly connected to the
separation panel, the cover being configured to cover at least part of the at least one opening
to disable access to at least one of the electronic devices.
[022]   The separation panel may further include at least one handle installed thereon.
[023] At least one of the first side panel and the second side panel may include a further
opening, the further opening being sized to fit a three-phase socket.
[024]   The third side panel may include an obround opening.

Description of Embodiments

                                                  5
[033]   Figure 1 illustrates an example of an enclosure 100 for a switchboard in accordance
with an embodiment of the present invention. The enclosure 100 is used to house electronic
devices installed in the switchboard, such as sockets, circuit breakers, switches, etc. The
electronic devices are not shown in Figure 1 to provide a clear view of the enclosure 100. The
enclosure 100 comprises a back panel 102. The back panel 102 is typically a thin plate. The
back panel 102 may include a plurality of holes (not shown) in order to fix the enclosure 100
to a stand (not shown) that supports the switchboard. The back panel 102 includes a first side
edge 104, a second side edge 106, a third side edge 108 and a fourth side edge 110 that define
a periphery of the back panel 102. The enclosure 100 further includes a plurality of side
panels extending from the edges of the back panel 102 respectively to define a wall.          For
example, the enclosure 100 further includes a first side panel 1042, a second side panel 1062,
a third side panel 1082 and a fourth side panel 1102. As shown in Figure 1, the first side
panel 1042 extends from the first side edge 104 of the back panel 102. The second side panel
1062 extends from the second side edge 106 of the back panel 102. The third side panel 1082
extends from the third side edge 108 of the back panel 102. Also, the fourth side panel 1102
extends from the fourth side edge 110 of the back panel 102. Thus, the side panels 1042,
1062, 1082 and 1102 form a wall extending from the edges of the back panel 102.
[034]   Moreover, the first side panel 1042 is located opposite to the second side panel 1062
and the third side panel 1082 is located opposite to the fourth side panel 1102. As shown in
Figure 1, the fourth side panel 1102 and the third panel 1082 are adjacent to the first side
panel 1042 and the second side panel 1062. Also, the extension of the fourth side panel 1102
from the fourth side edge 110 forms a front edge 112. Thus, the fourth side panel 1102
extends from the fourth side edge 110 at one end and forms the front edge 112 parallel to the
fourth side edge 110 at another end.
[035]   In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the enclosure 100 further
comprises an engagement member 114. The engagement member 114 includes a first part
1142 and a second part 1144. The first part 1142 is configured to pivot relative to the second
part 1144 and/or vice versa. Also, the second part 1144 is further configured to slide relative
to the first part 1142 along a direction of the front edge 112 of the fourth side panel 1102. The
second part 1144 slides along the direction of the front edge 112 of the fourth side panel 1102
to allow engagement with and disengagement from the first part 1142 along the direction of
the front edge 112 of the fourth side panel 1102.

                                                6
 [036] Figure 2A illustrates an example of the engagement member 114 in accordance with
an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Figure 2A, the first part 1142 of the
engagement member 114 includes a first tab 1143 and an elongate hollow member 1146.
Although the first tab 1143 and the elongate hollow member 1146 are shown in Figure 2A to
be formed integrally, the first tab 1142 and the elongate hollow member 1146 can be separate
parts that are mechanically connected together. The second part 1144 of the engagement
member 114 includes a second tab 1145 and an elongate pin 1148. Similarly, although the
second tab 1145 and the elongate pin 1148 are shown in Figure 2A to be formed integrally,
the second tab 1145 and the elongate pin 1148 can be separate parts that are mechanically
connected together. Also, the elongate hollow member 1146 of the first part 1142 is
configured to slidely and pivotably receive the elongate pin 1148 of the second part 1144.
Particularly, the elongate pin 1148 of the second part 1144 is able to slide into the elongate
hollow member 1146 of the first part 1142 to engage the first part 1142 with second part
 1144. The elongate pin 1148 is also able to slide out of the elongate hollow member 1146 to
disengage the first part 1142 from the second part 1144. Further, due to the round outer
surface of the elongate pin 1148 and the round inner surface of the elongate hollow member
 1146, the elongate pin 1148 is able to pivot within the elongate hollow member 1146.
 [037] Figure 2B illustrates an example of the engagement member 114 in accordance with
another embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Figure 2B, the first part 1142 of
the engagement member 114 includes the elongate pin 1148 and the second part 1144 of the
engagement member 114 includes the elongate hollow member 1146. Further, the hollow
member 1146 of the second part 1144 is configured to slidely and pivotably receive the
elongate pin 1148 of the first part 1142, as described with reference to Figure 2A.
 [038] Returning to Figure 1, the enclosure 100 further comprises a front panel 116. The
front panel 116 works as a cover of the enclosure 100 that enables or disables access to the
electronic devices installed in the enclosure 100. In accordance with an embodiment of the
present invention, the first part 1142 of the engagement member 114 is securely fixed to the
fourth side panel 1102 and the front panel 116 is securely fixed to the second part 1144 of the
engagement member 114. The first part 1142 and the second part 1144 are securely fixed to
the fourth side panel 1102 and the front panel 116 respectively by for example welding,
structural adhesive and rivets. It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that other
joining means such as fastening and hot pressing may also be used.

                                                 7
[039]    As the front panel 116 is joined with the fourth side panel 1102 using the engagement
member 114, the engagement member 114 allows the front panel 116 to pivot relative to the
fourth side panel 1102. Thus, due to the pivoting of the front panel 116, the front panel 116
takes two positions, an open position and a closed position. At the open position, the
electronic devices installed inside the enclosure 100 are accessible for use and conducting
activities such as inspection and maintenance, whereas in the closed position, the front panel
116 covers the enclosure 100 and no access to the electronic devices is available.
[040]    It should be noted that the side panels 1042, 1062, 1082 and 1102 are named and
positioned in Figure 1 for description purposes only, the particular naming and positioning of
the side panels shown in Figure 1 are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.
Particularly, the first side panel 1042 and the second side panel 1062 are shown in Figure 1 as
vertical side panels, the third side panel 1082 as a horizontal bottom panel and the fourth side
panel 1102 as a horizontal top panel when the enclosure 100 is in normal use. However, in
other embodiments, the fourth side panel 1102 can refer to a vertical side panel when the
enclosure 100 is in normal use, and the first side panel 1042 and the second side panel 1062
can refer to the horizontal bottom panel and the horizontal top panel, respectively.
[0411    In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the enclosure 100 further
comprises a support bar 118. The support bar 118 includes a first end 1182 and a second end
1184. The first end 1182 is configured to pivotably connect to one of the first side panel 1042
and the second side panel 1062. Also, the second end 1184 is configured to releasably
connect to the front panel 116 via a latching mechanism. When the second end 1182 of the
support bar 118 is connected or latched to the front panel 116, the support bar 118 supports
the front panel 116 to keep the front panel 116 at the open position as shown in Figure 1 in
order to allow access to the electronic devices in the enclosure 100. Further, if the second end
1182 of the support bar 118 is released from the front panel 116, the front panel 116 is able to
come to the closed position to disable access to the electronic devices. As shown in Figure 1,
as the front panel 116 is jointed with the horizontal fourth side panel 1102, which is shown as
the horizontal top panel in Figure 1 via the engagement member 114, the front panel 116 is
placed at the open position or the closed position by vertically pivoting the front panel 116.
In another embodiment where the fourth side panel 1102 is a vertical side panel when the
enclosure 100 is in normal use, the front panel 116 is placed at the open position or the closed
position by horizontally pivoting the front panel 116.

                                                8
[042] Figure 3 illustrates an example of an enclosure 100 in accordance with an
embodiment of the present invention. The enclosure 100 further comprises a movement
limiter 302. The movement limiter 302 is detachably connected to the fourth side panel 1102.
When the movement limiter 302 is connected to the fourth side panel 1102, the movement
limiter 302 limits the sliding of the second part 1144 of the engagement member 114 relative
to the first part 1142 of the engagement member 114 in order to disable the disengagement of
the second part 1144 from the first part 1142. On the other hand, if the movement limiter 302
is removed from fourth side panel 1102 by for example a worker using a screwdriver, the
second part 1144 (particularly, the elongate pin 1148) of the engagement member 114 can be
slid out of the first part 1142 (particularly, the elongate hollow member 1146) of the
engagement member 114. This way, the front panel 116 that is fixed to the second part 1144
of the engagement member 114 can be removed from the enclosure 100 even if the front
panel 1102 is in the closed position. Therefore, if the switchboard with the enclosure 100 is
sandwiched between two other switchboards, which makes it hard if not impossible to place
the front panel 116 at the open position, the front panel 116 can be removed in order for the
worker to access the electronic devices installed in the enclosure 100. In one embodiment of
the present invention, the movement limiter 302 is a bolt which is inserted into a hole 304
provided on the fourth side panel 1102. In one embodiment of the present invention, the hole
304 includes a thread to fasten the bolt into the hole 304. The bolt can be screwed into the
hole 304 of the fourth side panel 1102 with a portion of the bolt projecting from the fourth
panel 1102. This portion of the bolt limits the sliding of the second part 1144 of the
engagement member 114 relative to the first part 1142 of the engagement member 114.         On
the other hand, if the bolt is removed from the hole 304 by a screwdriver, the second part
1144 (particularly, the elongate pin 1148) of the engagement member 114 can be slid out of
the first part 1142 (particularly, the elongate hollow member 1146) of the engagement
member 114. This allows the removal of the front panel 116 from the enclosure 100.
[043] In the example shown in Figure 3, the fourth side panel 1102 is the horizontal top
panel when in use, and thus the front panel 116 horizontally slides along the direction of the
front edge 112 of the fourth side panel 1102. Therefore, the movement limiter 302 that is
detachably connected to the fourth side panel 1102 limits the horizontal sliding of the front
panel 116. In another embodiment, the fourth side panel 1102 is a vertical side panel when in
use, and the front panel 116 vertically slides along the direction of the front edge 112 of the

                                                 9
fourth side panel 1102, Therefore, the movement limiter 302 that is detachably connected to
the fourth side panel 1102 limits the vertical sliding of the front panel 116.
[044] Additionally, the hole 304 is located on the fourth side panel 1102 at a position where
if the bolt is screwed into the fourth side panel 1102 by a worker using a screwdriver, the bolt
disables the disengagement of the second part 1144 of the engagement member 114 from the
first part 1142 of the engagement member 114. That is, the hole 304 is located near the
engagement member 114 such that the bolt limits the sliding movement of the first part 1142
with respect to the second part 1144 of the engagement member 114. Thus, the bolt is
provided to prevent the detachment of the two parts that is first part 1142 and second part
1144 of the engagement member 114. As the engagement member 114 is connected between
the front panel 116 and the fourth side panel 1102, thus the bolt limits the sliding movement
of the front panel 116 with respect to the fourth side panel 1102 and thus prevents the
removal of the front panel 116 from the enclosure 100. If the bolt is removed from the fourth
side panel 1102 by for example a worker using a screwdriver, the front panel 116 can be
removed from the enclosure 100 by sliding the front panel 116 along the direction of the front
edge 112 of the fourth side panel 1102 even if the front panel 116 is in the closed position.
[0451 Further, the enclosure 100 further includes a support base 304. The support base 304
is secured to the back panel 102, particularly on the inner surface of the back panel 102, as
shown in Figure 3. Moreover, the support base 304 includes a first section 3042 of a first
height and a second section 3044 of a second height. As exemplarily shown in Figure 3, the
height of the first section 3042 is greater than the height of the second section 3044. Also, the
difference in height of the first section 3042 and the second section 3044 is provided to allow
electronic devices of different heights to be installed on it. As the electronic devices, such as
switches, sockets, and circuit breakers, are available in different sizes, the different heights of
sections of the support base 304 allow the electronic devices to be substantially flush with
each other in height. For example, a socket with a less height is installed on the higher first
section 3042, and a circuit breaker with a greater height is installed on the lower section
3044. This enables the enclosure 100 to accommodate the electrical devices in a neat manner
to facilitate access to and inspection and maintenance of the electronic devices.
[046] Figure 4 illustrates an exploded view of an enclosure 100 in accordance with an
embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Figure 4, the enclosure 100 further
comprises a first support member 402 and a second support member 404. The first support

                                                10
member 402 is installed on the first side panel 1042 and the second support member 404 is
installed on the second side panel 1062. Particularly, the first support member 402 and the
second support member 404 are fixed on the internal surface of the first side panel 1042 and
the second side panel 1062 respectively.
[047]   The enclosure 100 further includes a separation panel 406. The separation panel 406
rests on the first support member 402 and second support member 404 such that the
separation panel 406 is between the first side panel 1042 and the second side panel 1062.
Further, the separation panel 406 is detachably connected to the first support member 402 and
the second support member 404. The separation panel 406 is connected with the support
members 402 and 404 using for example a nut-bolt combination, a snap fit mechanism. Also,
the separation panel 406 is fixed at a predefined distance from the back panel 102 such that
the electronic devices can be installed between the separation panel 406 and support base
304. Further, the separation panel 406 includes at least one handle 4062 fixed on the
separation panel 406. The at least one handle 4062 facilitates the installation of the separation
panel 406 on the first support member 402 and second support member 404 and removal of
