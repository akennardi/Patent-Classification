     DEVICES, SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR MEDICAMENT DELIVERY
                                       Background
[10011      The invention relates generally to a medical device, and more particularly to an
medicament delivery device for automatically injecting a medicament into a body of a
patient.
[10021      Exposure to certain substances, such as, for example, peanuts, shellfish, bee
venom, certain drugs, toxins, and the like, can cause allergic reactions in some individuals.
Such allergic reactions can, at times, lead to anaphylactic shock, which can cause a sharp
drop in blood pressure, hives, and/or severe airway constriction. Accordingly, responding
rapidly to mitigate the effects from such exposures can prevent injury and/or death. For
example, in certain situations, an injection of epinephrine (i.e., adrenaline) can provide
substantial and/or complete relief from the allergic reaction.       In other situations, for
example, an injection of an antidote to a toxin can greatly reduce and/or eliminate the
harm potentially caused by the exposure.
[10031      Because emergency medical facilities may not available when an individual is
suffering from an allergic reaction, some individuals carry an auto-injector to rapidly self
administer a medicament in response to an allergic reaction. Some known auto-injectors
are cylindrical in shape and include a spring loaded needle to automatically penetrate the
user's skin and inject the medicament.       Such known auto-injectors can be bulky and
conspicuous, which can make carrying them inconvenient and undesirable.            Moreover,
some known auto-injectors do not have a retractable needle and, as such, cause a sharps
hazard when injection is complete.
110041      Some known auto-injectors include a locking cap at the proximal end of the
auto-injector to prevent inadvertent actuation and a needle cover at the distal end of the
auto-injector. Such a configuration can, at times, cause a user to become confused as to
which end of the auto-injector is the "needle end" (i.e., the distal end) and which end of
the auto-injector is the "actuation end" (i.e., the proximal end).        As such, in some
situations, a user may mistakenly actuate the known auto-injector away from the intended
injection site. Such an error can result, for example, in the auto-injector being actuated
into the user's thumb and/or finger.

   WO 2007/126851                                                       PCT/US2007/007626
                                             2
11005]      Thus, a need exists for an auto-injector that can be more conveniently carried
by a user and does not present a sharps hazard upon completion of the injection.
Furthermore, a need exists for an auto-injector that can be actuated from its distal end.
[1006]      To actuate such a medicament delivery device, however, the user may be
required to execute a series of operations.     For example, to actuate some known auto
injectors, the user must remove a protective cap, remove a locking device, place the auto
injector in a proper position against the body and then press a button to actuate the auto
injector.   Failure to complete these operations properly can result in an incomplete
injection and/or injection into an undesired location of the body. In certain instances, for
example, users who have become confused in the operation of some known auto-injectors
have inadvertently injected the medicament into their thumb by improperly positioning the
auto-injector.
[10071      The likelihood of improper use of known medicament delivery devices can be
compounded by the nature of the user and/or the circumstances under which such devices
are used. For example, many users are not trained medical professionals and may have
never been trained in the operation of such devices. Moreover, in certain situations, the
user may not be the patient, and may therefore have no experience with the medicament
delivery device.     Similarly, because some known medicament delivery devices are
configured to be used relatively infrequently in response to an allergic reaction or the like,
even those users familiar with the device and/or who have been trained may not be well
practiced at operating the device.       Finally, such devices are often used during an
emergency situation, during which even experienced and/or trained users may be subject
to confusion, panic and/or the physiological effects of the condition requiring treatment.
[10081       Some known medicament delivery devices include printed instructions to
inform the user of the steps required to properly deliver the medicament. Such printed
instructions, however, can be inadequate for the class of users and/or the situations
described above. Moreover, because some known medicament delivery devices, such as,
for example, auto-injectors, pen injectors, inhalers or the like, can be compact, such
printed instructions may be too small to read and comprehend during an emergency
situation.

 WO 2007/126851                                                      PCT/US2007/007626
                                          3
[10091      Some known medicament delivery devices include and electronic system to
assist the user in setting the proper dosage and/or maintaining a compliance log. Such
known medicament delivery devices and the accompanying electronic systems can be
large and therefore not conveniently carried by the user.          Moreover, such known
medicament     delivery   devices  and the   accompanying     electronic  systems can be
complicated and/or expensive to manufacture.
[1010]      Thus, a need exists for a medicament delivery device and/or a medicament
container that can be conveniently carried by a user, that provides instructions that can be
easily understood by an untrained user in any type of situation, and that can be
inexpensively manufactured.
[10111      Some known medicament delivery devices are associated with simulated
medicament delivery devices (e.g., "trainers") to provide a method for users to practice
using the medicament delivery device without being exposed to the medicament or
needles typically contained therein.      Such simulated medicament delivery devices,
however, can also include inadequate use instructions as described above.         Moreover,
some known simulated medicament delivery devices can be difficult to reset for
subsequent use.
[1012]      Thus, a need exists for a simulated medicament delivery device that provides
instructions that can be easily understood by an untrained user in any type of situation.
Additionally, a need exists for a simulated medicament delivery device that can be easily
reset for subsequent use.
                                        Summary
[1013]      Apparatuses and methods for automatic medicament injection are described
herein.   In one embodiment, an apparatus includes a housing, a medicament container
disposed within the housing and an actuator. The actuator is configured to be disposed
within the housing and to move the medicament container within the housing.             The
actuator includes a release member and an energy storage member. The energy storage
member has a first position and a second position. When in the first position, the energy
storage member has a first potential energy.     When in the second position the energy
storage member has a second potential energy less than the first potential energy. The
energy storage member is configured to convert a portion of the first potential energy into
                                             I

   WO 2007/126851                                                       PCT/US2007/007626

  kinetic energy when it moves from its first position to its second position to move the
  medicament container within the housing. The energy storage member has a longitudinal
  axis offset from a longitudinal axis of the medicament container. The release member is
  configured to selectively deploy the energy storage member from its first position to its
  second position.
  [10141       In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a label configured to be coupled
  to a medicament delivery device. The label includes a first surface and a second surface.
  The first surface is configured to be coupled to an outer surface of the medicament
  delivery device. The second surface includes a textual indicia. The label further includes
  an electronic circuit system configured to output an electronic signal.
  [10151      In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a simulated medicament delivery
  device and an electronic circuit system coupled to the simulated medicament delivery
  device.   The electronic circuit system is configured to output an electronic output
  associated with a use of the simulated medicament delivery device.
  [1016]      In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a container defining an internal
  region configured to contain multiple medicament delivery devices, such as, for example,
 pen injectors, auto-injectors, inhalers or the like.   The container includes an electronic
 circuit system configured to output a first electronic output associated with a first
 medicament delivery device contained within the internal region when the first
 medicament delivery device is removed from the internal region of the container. The
 electronic circuit system is further configured to output a second electronic output
 associated with a second medicament delivery device contained within the internal region
 when the second medicament delivery device is removed from the internal region of the
 container. The second electronic output is different than the first electronic output. At
 least one of the first electronic output or the second electronic output is associated with a
use instruction of the first medicament delivery device and/or the second- medicament
delivery device.
 [1017]      Because emergency medical facilities may not be available when an individual
is suffering from a medical condition, some individuals carry an auto-injector to rapidly
self-administer a medicament in response to such medical conditions. Some known auto
injectors are cylindrical in shape and include vial containing a liquid medicament and a

  WO 2007/126851                                                       PCT/US2007/007626
                                             5
 spring loaded needle to automatically penetrate the user's skin and inject the medicament.
 The storage of certain medicaments in a liquid form, however, can result in a shorter shelf
 life and/or an unstable medicament. Accordingly, some known auto-injectors include a
 vial containing a first medicament and a medicament stored separately. Such auto
 injectors are often referred to as "wet / dry" auto-injectors, because one medicament is
 often a liquid (e.g., water) and the other medicament is often a solid (e.g., glucagon
 powder). In use, the first medicament and the second medicament must be mixed prior to
 injection.
 [10181      Some known wet / dry auto-injectors, however, require that the user manually
 actuate a mixing mechanism that must be used prior to injection. Such configurations can,
 however, result in incomplete mixing and/or injection occurring without mixing.
 Moreover, such configurations can be complicated, making them difficult for a user to
 operate during an emergency situation.
 [1019]      Some    known     wet/dry   auto-injectors employ     a  single   mechanism  to
 automatically mix and inject the medicaments contained therein.         Because the mixing
 operation is not independent from the injection operation in such configurations, however,
the medicament can be injected prior to the completion of the mixing operation and/or
prior to the auto-injector being properly positioned for the injection operation.
 [10201     Thus, a need exists for an auto-injector that can separately store two or more
medicaments and that can automatically mix and inject the medicaments in two distinct
operations.

[1138]      A status of a system 1000 can be determined via status indicator 1400, which
can provide a view, such as via a UV blocking, photo-sensitive, and/or translucent
window, into an interior of housing 1100. Viewable through the window can be a status
of medicament carried by housing 1100, a location of a needle and/or injection apparatus
for the medicament, and/or an activation status of system 1000. For example, if the
medicament has aged to the point of discoloration, which aging might or might not render
the medication useless, harmful, etc., status indicator 1400 can allow that situation to be
determined. In some embodiments, gas can escape housing 1100 via status indicator 1400
and/or another opening in housing 1100.
 [1139]      Some embodiments of system 1000 can provide a compact medicament
delivery mechanism that can efficiently and/or rapidly deliver a prescribed dose. The
length (L) and width (W) of system 1000 can be similar to that of a credit card, and the
 thickness (T) can be less than one inch. Thus, some embodiments of system 1000 can
 provide a conveniently carried, easy-to-use, easy to activate drug delivery apparatus that
 can require little to no training to safely carry, use, and/or dispose of.
 [11401      To assist a user in positioning system 1000 in a correct orientation for
 injection, system 1000 and/or housing 1100 can provide various tactile clues. For
 example, a top 1110 of housing 1100 can be rounded, and a bottom 1120 of actuation bar
  1300 of housing 1100 can be flat. Other tactile clues are also possible, such as bulges,
 ribs, grooves, gaps, roughened surfaces, indentations, etc.

 system 1000 of FIG. 4 in second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth operative positions,
 respectively.
  [11421     System 1000 can comprise a housing 1100, handheld portion 1800, actuation
  guard 1200, and/or actuation bar 1300. System 1000 can comprise system actuator 2000,
  gas reservoirs 3000, medicament actuator 4000, medicament storage assembly 5000,
  medicament carrier 9000, needle assembly 6000, use indicator 7000, and/or gas vent
  mechanism 8000, etc.

   WO 2007/126851                                                       PCT/US2007/007626
                                             18
contents of a compress gas container. For example, system actuator 2000 can comprise a
compressed gas container 2400, which initially can contain a compressed gas 2500, an
actuating portion of which can be released from container 2400 by penetration of a gas
port 2600 via a point of a puncturer 2700. Upon removal and/or relocation of actuation
guard 1200, actuation bar 1300 can be moved closer to and/or in contact with handheld
portion 1800.     Upon removal and/or relocation of actuation guard 1200, gas container
2400 can be brought into contact with puncturer 2700 via extension of a pre-compressed
                                                                                           can
spring 2300 and/or movement of an actuation stick 2200. Thus, actuation guard 1200
prevent accidental activation of system 1000 and/or unintended discharge of an actuating
portion of the contents 2500 of gas container 2400.
 [11441       Once gas port 2600 has been punctured, an actuating portion of compressed gas
2500 can escape from container 2400 and flow via gas reservoirs 3000, such as gas
channel 3100. The flowing gas can meet and/or apply gas pressure to medicament
 actuator 4000, which can comprise a pusher 4100, which can travel within a sleeve 1500
 defined by walls 1520. Sleeve 1500 can be constructed of metal, stainless steel,
 aluminum, plastic, polycarbonate, etc. Seals 4200, such as o-rings, can resist gas leakage,
 such as past pusher 4100 and/or out of housing 1100. Thus, pusher 4100 can function as a
 piston traveling within a cylinder, although it is not necessarily required that the cross
 sectional shape of sleeve 1500 be round.
 [11451       Medicament actuator 4000 can interface with medicament storage assembly
 5000. For example, medicament actuator 4000 can comprise a plurality of plungers 4300,
 each of which can be capped with a piston 4400 which can sealingly slide and/or move
 within a corresponding vial 5100 containing a liquid medicament 5200. For example, in
 response to pressure applied by an actuating portion of the contents 2500 of compressed
 gas container 2400, pusher 4100 can cause plungers 4300 and/or pistons 4400 to
  simultaneously move. The number of corresponding sets of plungers 4300, pistons 4400,
  and/or vials 5100 can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or more. Pistons 4400 can be constructed of a
  resilient, durable, and/or sealing material, such as a rubber. Each plunger 4300 from the
  plurality of plungers can define a longitudinal axis, the longitudinal axes (e.g., axes 4310,
  4320, 4330, 4340) of the plurality of plungers can be parallel, non-coaxial, and/or co
  planar.

   WO 2007/126851                                                        PCT/US2007/007626

  111461      Each vial 5100 from the plurality of vials can be substantially cylindrical with a
  substantially round and/or substantially elliptical cross-sectional shape. Thus, each vial
  5100 can define a longitudinal axis, the longitudinal axes of the plurality of vials can be
  parallel, non-coaxial, and/or co-planar. The longitudinal axis of each vial can be co-axial
  with the longitudinal axis of its corresponding plunger.
  [11471      Each vial can be capped at one end with a frangible seal 5300, which can be
 burst when piston 4400 generates sufficient pressure upon medicament 5200, thereby
 allowing at least a portion of medicament 5200 to flow out of vial 5100 and into
 medicament carrier 9000. Thus, the plurality of vials can be fluidly coupleable to the
 actuating portion of the contents 2500 of gas container 2400.
 [11481       Medicament carrier 9000 can hold each of vials 5100 and can travel within
 sleeve 1500. Medicament carrier 9000 can comprise a plurality of channels 9200 adapted
 to receive medicament 5200 as it exits its respective vial 5100, and direct medicament
 5200 to a common conduit 9300. Medicament carrier 9000 can interface with needle
 assembly 6000 and/or use indicator 7000.
 [1149]       From common conduit 9300, medicament 5200 can enter needle assembly
6000, such as into a single needle 6100 via which medicament can approach needle tip
6200. As medicament actuator 4000 and/or medicament carrier 9000 are driven toward
actuator bar 1300, needle tip 6200 can penetrate an end 6400 of needle sheath 6300 and
exit actuator bar 1300 at needle port 1340.
[11501        Referring to FIG. 5, upon movement of actuation bar 1300 closer to handheld
portion 1800, sheath seat 1330 can come in contact with sheath tip 6400, thereby causing
sheath 6300 to buckle and/or crumble.          As actuator bar 1300 comes in contact with
handheld portion 1800, bar stop 1320 can approach medicament carrier stop 9400, while
carrier spring 1600 is compressed.
111511       Referring to FIG. 6, as at least a portion of contents 2500 of gas container 2400
escapes, it can flow through channel 3100.            The gas, which can still be relatively
pressurized, can begin to accumulate behind pusher 4100 to form an expanding gas
chamber 3200 and to cause medicament actuator 4000, medicament storage assembly
5000, and medicament carrier 9000 to slide together within sleeve 1500. As medicament
actuator 4000, medicament storage assembly 5000, and medicament carrier 9000 slide

    WO 2007/126851                                                        PCT/US2007/007626
                                               20
    closer to actuator bar 1300, spring 1600 becomes increasingly compressed between bar
   stop 1320 and medicament carrier stop 9400. As medicament actuator 4000, medicament
   storage assembly 5000, and medicament carrier 9000 slide closer
                                                                           to actuator bar 1300,
   needle tip 6200 can extend further from actuator bar 1300 and sheath 6300 can become
   further compressed and/or deformed. At its ultimate extension point, needle tip 6200 can
   extend from housing 1100 from approximately 0.25 millimeters to approximately
                                                                                               20
   millimeters, including all values and subranges therebetween, such as up to approximately
   2 millimeters, greater than approximately 5 millimeters, from approximately
                                                                                            5.13
  millimeters to approximately 9.98 millimeters, etc.
   [11521      Referring to FIG. 7, as gas chamber 3200 continues to expand, medicament
  carrier 9000 can be driven until medicament carrier stop 9400 contacts actuator bar stop
   1300 thereby resisting further travel of medicament carrier 9000. At that point, additional
  expansion of gas chamber 3200 can cause medicament actuator 4000, pusher 4100,
  plungers 4300, and/or pistons 4400 to initiate travel with respect to medicament storage
  assembly 5000, thereby generating an expulsion pressure in vials 5100, and/or thereby
  rupturing frangible seals 5300 and allowing medicament 5200 to enter medicament carrier
  9000, and begin flowing through medicament channels 9200, medicament conduit
                                                                                           9300,
  needle 6100, and/or out needle tip 6200 and into a patient. Alternatively, frangible
                                                                                           seals
  5300 can be replaced and/or augmented by a frangible seal located at or near
                                                                                          where
 medicament conduit 9300 couples to needle 6100. Frangible seals 5300 can
                                                                                              be
 constructed of a thin, taught, resilient, durable, and/or sealing material potentially having
                                                                                                a
 predetermined yield strength, such as a rubber, such as chromo butyl rubber, and/or
                                                                                            of a
 relatively brittle material potentially having a predetermined yield strength, such
                                                                                              as
 ceramic, certain plastics, such as polystyrene, etc.
 [1153]       As medicament carrier stop 9400 contacts actuator bar stop 1320, medicament
 carrier hooks 9600 can engage with engagement receivers 7100 in use indicator 7000.
 [11541       Referring to FIG. 8, as gas chamber 3200 continues to expand, medicament
actuator 4000, pusher 4100, plungers 4300, and/or pistons 4400 can continue moving
                                                                                           until
they complete their travel within medicament storage assembly 5000, thereby expelling
                                                                                               a

4400 can continue moving until they complete their travel with respect to medicament
carrier 9000, thereby causing gas release actuator 9700 to engage with gas relief valve
8200. Engagement of gas release actuator 9700 with gas relief valve 8200 can cause gas
within gas chamber 3200 to exit gas chamber 3200, discharge away from pistons 4400,
and/or exhaust from system 1000 and/or housing 1100, such as via status indicator 1400
and/or a gas escape port located on housing 1100).
[1155]      Referring to FIG. 8 and FIG. 9, as sufficient gas is vented from gas chamber
3200, the pressure applied by the gas in gas chamber 3200 can decrease until the force
applied by the gas on medicament actuator 4000 is less than the force of compressed
spring 1600.    Thus, spring(s) 1600 can begin to expand, thereby moving medicament
carrier 9000, vial assembly 5000, and medicament actuator 4000 away from actuator bar
1300 and helping to exhaust gas from gas chamber 3200. As medicament carrier 9000
moves, use indicator 7000 can travel with it, due to the engaged relationship of
medicament carrier hooks 9600 and engagement receivers 7100 and/or engagement
catches 7200 in use indicator 7000. As use indicator 7000 moves away from actuation bar
1300, sheath 6300 can travel with it, thereby creating a gap between sheath tip 6400 and
needle port 1340, and thereby exposing a previously non-visible colored portion 1350 of
actuation bar 1300 and/or providing an indication that system 1000 has been used (and
likely substantially exhausted of its medicament), thereby discouraging any further
attempts to use system 1000.
[1156]      As medicament carrier 9000 moves away from actuator bar 1300, needle 6100
can retract into sheath 6300 which un-buckles and/or un-deforms towards its original
shape. Eventually, needle 6100 can retract completely within the boundaries of housing
1100, thereby tending to prevent accidental needle sticks after the initial injection and/or
potentially reducing and/or eliminating a sharps hazard.
[1157]      In some embodiments, system actuator 2000 can comprise a finger triggered,
twistable, pivotable, and/or lever-operated mechanism.      For example, system actuator
2000 can comprise a twistable handle that can screw into gas port 2600.             In some
embodiments, system actuator 2000 can be a finger trigger located on a side of the
housing.

[1158]      FIG. 10 is a flowchart of an embodiment of a method 10000 for operating a
medicament delivery apparatus. At activity 10100, an actuation lock for the apparatus is
released.   At activity 10200, an actuating portion of the contents of a compressed gas
container are released.   At activity 10300, via pressure provided by the released gas, a
needle is extended from the apparatus.     At activity 10400, via pressure provided by the
released gas, a piston applies pressure to a medicament stored in one of a plurality of vials.
At activity 10500, a frangible seal containing the medicament in the vial is burst. At
activity 10600, the medicament flows from the vial, through the needle, and into a patient
At activity 10700, once a predetermined dose is expelled and/or injected, the needle is
withdrawn from the patient and/or retracted into the pre-use bounds of the apparatus. At
activity 10800, the apparatus is rendered unusable for additional injections and/or
indicated as previously utilized.
 [11591      FIG. 11 is a perspective view of an embodiment of system 1000, showing
 actuation guard 1200 removed from housing 1100, so that actuation guard 1200 no longer
 separates actuator bar 1300 from handheld portion 1800. Actuation guard 1200 can
 comprise a grippable portion 1220 that can be gripped by a user to pull actuation guard
 1200 away from housing 1100, thereby allowing system 1000 to be activated, such as via
 slapping actuator bar 1300 against a thigh of the user. Actuation guard 1200 can comprise
 an actuation stick separator portion 1240, that can keep separate actuation stick prongs
 2240 when actuation guard 1200 is installed on housing 1100. Actuation guard 1200 can
 comprise a guard portion 1260 that can separate actuator bar 1300 from handheld portion
 1800 when system 1000 is not in use and/or when system 1000 has not been used.
 111601      FIG. 12 is a perspective cross-sectional view taken along line B-B of FIG. 11,
 and FIG. 13 is a perspective view of an embodiment of actuation stick 2200. Referring to
 FIGS. 12 and 13, system 1000 can comprise housing 1100, actuation bar 1300, and system
 actuator 2000, which can comprise prong squeezer 1390, actuation stick 2200, prong
 retainer 2100, spring 2300, upper spring retainer 2260, gas container 2400, gas port 2600,
 and/or puncturer 2700. When actuation bar 1300 is pressed firmly against a user's body,
 such as via slapping housing actuation bar against the user's thigh, buttocks, and/or arm,
 prong squeezer 1390 can urge prong tips 2220 of prongs 2240 of actuation stick 2200
 toward one another. Note that prong tips 2200 can have a triangular, wedge, angular,
  and/or frusto-conical shape. As prongs tips 2220 slide along the angled V-groove of prong
  squeezer 1390, prong catches 2230 can substantially lose contact with prong retainer 2100.

   This can allow compressed spring 2300 to rapidly urge actuation stick 2200 and gas
   container 2400 toward puncturer 2700, which can penetrate gas port 2600, thereby
   allowing gas to escape from gas container 2400. Although any of many different types of
   gas containers can be utilized, an example of a suitable gas container can be obtained from
   Leland Limited, Inc. of South Plainfield, NJ.
   [11611     FIG. 14 is a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of gas venting mechanism
   8000 of system 1000 taken along line A-A of FIG. 3. System 1000 can comprise handheld
  portion 1800, actuator bar 1300, sleeve 1500.      As pistons 4440 near the limit of their
  travels, medicament 5200 can be expelled along medicament path 5900, which can extend
  past frangible seal 5300, through medicament channels 9200, medicament conduit 9300,
  and needle 6100, and into the body of a user, such as subcutaneously, intramuscularly,
  and/or at a depth of from approximately 0.25 millimeters to approximately 20 millimeters,
  including all values and subranges therebetween, such as up to 2 millimeters, greater than
  5 millimeters, etc.
  [11621      As pistons 4440 near the limit of their travels, engagement of gas release
  actuator 9700 with gas relief valve 8200 can cause compressed spring 8300 to move valve
 arm such that o-ring 8400 is urged away from its seat 8500. This movement can reveal a
 passage 8600, via which gas can exit gas chamber 3200 along gas exhaust path 8900,
 which can extend between sleeve inner walls 1520 and outer walls 9100 of medicament
 carrier 9000.    Eventually, gas exhaust path 8900 can extend between handheld portion
  1800 and actuator bar 1300. Likewise, an alternative embodiment of valve 8200, made of
 rubber or any other resilient material, can be placed across seat 8500 to provide a seal that,
 once gas release actuator 9700 interacts with valve 8200, allows valve 8200 to bend or
 flap upwards away from seat 8500, causing the gas to escape via passage 8600.
 [11631      FIGS. 15 and 16 are schematic illustrations of an auto-injector 2002 according
to an embodiment of the invention in a first configuration and a second configuration,
respectively. The auto-injector 2002 includes a housing 2110 that contains a medicament
container 2262, an energy storage member 2410, a release member 2540 and an injection
member 2212. The medicament container 2262, which can be, for example, a pre-filled
cartridge, a vial, an ampule or the like, is movably disposed within the housing 2110. The
medicament container 2262 contains a medicament 2268, such
                                                                            as, for example,
epinephrine. As illustrated, the medicament container 2262 can be moved, as indicated by

 WO 2007/126851                                                        PCT/US2007/007626

arrow B in FIG. 16, along its longitudinal axis Lm between a first position (FIG. 15) and a
second position (FIG. 16).       When the medicament container 2262 is in its first (or
retracted) position, the medicament container 2262 is spaced apart from the injection
member 2212.       When the medicament container 2262 is in the second (or advanced)
position, the medicament container 2262 is placed in fluid communication with the
injection member 2212.      In this manner, when the medicament container 2262 is in the
second (or advanced) position, the medicament 2268 can be conveyed via the injection
member 2212 from the medicament container 2262 into a body of a patient. The injection
member 2212 can be, for example, a needle, a nozzle or the like.
[1164]       The energy storage member 2410, which can be any suitable device for storing
energy, such as, for example, a spring, a battery, a compressed gas cylinder or the like, is
also movably disposed within the housing 2110. As shown, the energy storage member
2410 defines a longitudinal axis Le that is offset from the longitudinal axis Lm of the
medicament container 2262. The energy storage member 2410 can be moved, as indicated
by arrow A in FIG. 16, within the housing 2110 along its longitudinal axis Le between a
first position (FIG. 15) and a second position (FIG. 16). When the energy storage member
2410 is in its first position, the energy storage member 2410 has a first potential energy.
When the energy storage member 2410 is in its second position, the energy storage
member 2410 has a second potential energy that is less than the first potential energy.
When the energy storage member 2410 moves from its first position to its second position,
it converts at least a portion of its first potential energy into kinetic energy to move the
medicament container 2262 between its first position and its second position.
[11651       Said another way, the movement of the energy storage member 2410 from its
first position to its second position results in the production of a force that acts upon the
medicament container 2262 to move the medicament container 2262 between its first
position and its second position. The non-coaxial relationship between the longitudinal
axis Lm of the medicament container 2262 and the longitudinal axis Le of the energy
storage member 2410 allows the medicament container 2262 and the energy storage
member 2410 to be arranged within the housing 2110 in any number of different
configurations. In this manner, the auto-injector 2002 can have any number of different
sizes and shapes, such as, for example, a substantially rectangular shape.

  [1166]      The release member 2540 is disposed within the housing 2110 and is
  configured to selectively deploy the energy storage member 2410 from its first position to
  its second position. The release member 2540 can be any suitable mechanism for moving
  the energy storage member 2410, such as, for example, a mechanical linkage, a spring
  loaded rod or the like. In this manner, a user can actuate the auto-injector by manipulating
  a portion of the release member 2540.
  [11671      FIG. 17 is a perspective view of an auto-injector 3002 according to an
 embodiment of the invention in a first configuration. The auto-injector 3002 includes a
 housing 3110 having a proximal end portion 3112 and a distal end portion 3114. The
 distal end portion 3114 of the housing 3110 includes a protrusion 3142 to help a user grasp
 and retain the housing 3110 when using the auto-injector 3002.         Said another way, the
 protrusion 3142 is configured to prevent the auto-injector 3002 from slipping from the
 user's grasp during use. A base 3520 is movably coupled to the distal end portion 3114 of
 the housing 3110. A needle guard assembly 3810 is removably coupled to the base 3520.
 Similarly, a safety lock 3710 is removably coupled to the base 3520.              To inject a
 medicament into the body, the distal end portion 3114 of the housing is oriented towards
 the user such that the base 3520 is in contact with the portion of the body where the
 injection is to be made. The base 3520 is then moved towards the proximal end 3112 of
 the housing 3110 to actuate the auto-injector 3002.       The housing 3110 also includes a
transparent status window 3118 (see FIG. 36) to allow a user to determine the status of the
 auto-injector 3002 or the medicament contained therein.
 [11681      FIG. 18 is a perspective view of the auto-injector 3002 showing the housing
3110 in phantom lines so that the components contained within the housing 3110 can be
more clearly seen. For clarity, FIG. 18 shows the auto-injector 3002 without the needle
guard assembly 3810 and the safety lock 3710. Similarly, FIG. 19 is a front view of the
auto-injector 3002 showing the housing 3110 in phantom lines. The auto-injector 3002
includes a medicament injector 3210 and a movable member 3312 engaged with the
medicament injector 3210, each of which are disposed within the housing 3110. The auto
injector 3002 also includes a system actuator 3510, a compressed gas container 3412 and a
gas release mechanism 3612.
111691       The medicament injector 3210 includes a carrier 3250 that is movable within
the housing 3110, a medicament container 3262 and a needle 3212. The medicament

   container 3262 is coupled to the carrier 3250. The needle 3212 is disposed within a needle
   hub portion 3223 (see FIG. 22) of the carrier to allow the needle 3212 to be placed in fluid
   communication with the medicament container 3262 during an injection event.
   [11701     The movable member 3312 includes a proximal end portion 3316 and a distal
   end portion 3318. The proximal end portion 3316 includes a surface 3322 that, together
   with the housing 3110, defines a gas chamber 3120. Said another way, the surface
                                                                                          3322

   disposed within the medicament container 3262. In use, the movable member 3312
                                                                                        moves
   towards the distal end portion 3114 of the housing 3110, as indicated by arrow

   response to a force produced by a pressurized gas on the surface 3322 of the movable
   member 3312. As a result, the movable member 3312 and the medicament injector
                                                                                          3250

  needle 3212 from the housing 3110. The movable member 3312 then continues
                                                                                      to move
  within the medicament container 3262 to expel a medicament from the medicament
  container 3262 through the needle 3212.
  [1171]      The auto-injector 3002 is actuated by the system actuator 3510, which is
  configured to move the compressed gas container 3412 into contact with the gas
                                                                                       release
  mechanism 3612. The gas release mechanism 3612 punctures a portion of the compressed
  gas container 3412 to release the pressurized gas contained therein into the gas
                                                                                     chamber
  3120 defined by the housing 3110.
  [1172]       The system actuator 3510 includes a rod 3540, a spring 3560 and a spring
 retainer 3570. The rod 3540 has a proximal end portion 3542 and a distal end
                                                                                       portion
 3544. The proximal end portion 3542 of the rod 3540 is coupled to the compressed

 container 3412.    The distal end portion 3544 of the rod 3540 is coupled to the spring
 retainer 3570 by two projections 3548, which can be moved inwardly towards each
                                                                                         other

 [11731      The spring 3560 is disposed about the rod 3540 in a compressed state such that
the spring 3560 is retained by the proximal end portion 3542 of the rod 3540

  3120 (see FIG. 31). Fourth, the pressurized gas produces a force that causes
  member 3312 and the medicament injector 3210 to move distally within the housing 3110
                                                                      causes the needle 3212 to

medicament container 3262, thereby expelling the predicament through the needle 3212
(see FIG. 44). This operation can be referred to as the "injection operation."        Seventh,
upon completion of the injection, the pressurized gas is released from the gas chamber
3120, thereby allowing the medicament injector 3210 and the movable member 3312 to be
moved proximally within the housing. This operation can be referred to as the "retraction
operation" (see FIG. 45). A detailed description of the components contained in the auto
injector 3002 and how they cooperate to perform each of these operations is discussed
below.
[11771      Prior to use, the auto-injector 3002 must first be enabled by first removing the
needle guard 3810 and then removing the safety lock 3710. As illustrated by arrow G in
FIG. 20, the needle guard 3810 is removed by pulling it distally. Similarly, as illustrated
by arrow H in FIG. 21, the safety lock 3710 is removed by pulling it substantially normal
to the longitudinal axis Le of the compressed gas container 3412. Said another way, the
safety lock 3710 is removed by moving it in a direction substantially normal to the
direction that the needle guard 3810 is moved. As described in more detail herein, the
needle guard 3810 and the safety lock 3710 are cooperatively arranged to prevent the
safety lock 3710 from being removed before the needle guard 3810 has been removed.
Such an arrangement prevents the auto-injector 3002 from being actuated while the needle
guard 3810 is in place.
 [1178]      As illustrated in FIG. 22, the needle guard 3810 includes a sheath 3820 and a
sheath retainer 3840. The sheath 3820 has a proximal end portion 3822 and a distal end
portion 3824 and defines an opening 3826 configured to receive a portion of the needle
3212 when the needle guard 3810 is in a first (or installed) position. The sheath 3820
 further defines a recessed portion 3828 within the opening 3826 that engages a
 corresponding protrusion 3238 defined by an outer surface 3236 of the needle hub 3223.
 In this manner, when the needle guard 3810 is in its first position, the sheath 3820 is
removably coupled to the needle hub 3223.       In some embodiments, the recessed portion
 3828 and the protrusion 3238 form a seal that is resistant to microbial penetration.
 [1179]     The sheath retainer 3840 has a proximal portion 3842 and a distal portion 3844.
The proximal portion 3842 of the sheath retainer 3840 includes a protrusion 3856 that
 engages a corresponding recess 3526 in the base 3520 (see FIG. 28) to removably couple
 the sheath retainer 3840 to the base 3520. The distal portion 3844 of the sheath retainer

 3840 defines an opening 3846 through which the distal end portion 3824 of the sheath
 3820 is disposed. The distal portion 3844 of the sheath retainer 3840 includes a series of
 retaining tabs 3852 that engage the distal end portion 3824 of the sheath 3820 to couple
 the sheath 3820 to the sheath retainer 3840. In this manner, when the sheath retainer 3840
 is moved distally away from the base 3520 into a second (or removed) position, as shown
 in FIG. 20, the sheath 3820 is removed from the needle 3412. Moreover, this arrangement
 allows the sheath 3820 to be disposed about the needle 3412 independently from when the
 sheath retainer 3840 is coupled to the sheath 3820. As such, the two-piece construction of
 the needle guard provides flexibility during manufacturing. The distal portion 3844 of the
 sheath retainer 3840 also includes a protrusion 3848 to aid the user when grasping the
needle guard 3810.
 [11801      When the needle guard 3810 is in its first position, the sheath retainer 3840 is
 disposed within a recess 3720 defined by one of the extended portions 3716 of the safety
lock 3710 (see FIG. 25).      This arrangement prevents the safety lock 3710 from being
removed when the needle guard 3810 is in its first position, which in turn, prevents the
auto-injector 3002 from being actuated when the needle guard 3810 is in its first position.
 [11811      The outer surface of the sheath retainer 3840 includes an indicia 3850 to
instruct the user in operating the auto-injector 3002. As shown in FIG. 21, the indicia
3850 includes a numeral to indicate the order of operation and an arrow to indicate the
direction in which the needle guard 3810 should be moved. In some embodiments, the
indicia 3850 can include different colors, detailed instructions or any other suitable indicia
to instruct the user. In other embodiments, the indicia 3850 can protrude from the sheath
retainer 3840 to aid the user when grasping the needle guard 3810.
[11821      In some embodiments, the sheath 3820 can be constructed from any suitable
material, such as, for example polypropylene, rubber or any other elastomer.          In some
embodiments, the sheath 3820 can be constructed from a rigid material to reduce the
likelihood of needle sticks during the manufacturing process. In other embodiments, the
sheath 3820 can be constructed from a flexible material.
[1183]      After the needle guard 3810 is removed, the user must then remove the safety
lock 3710, as indicated in FIG. 21.     As shown in FIG. 25, the safety lock 3710 is a U
shaped member having a first end 3712 and a second end 3714. The second end 3714 of

  WO 2007/126851                                                       PCT/US2007/007626
                                            30
the safety lock 3710 includes two extended portions 3716, each of which includes an
inwardly facing protrusion 3718.       When the safety lock 3710 is in its first (or locked)
position, the extended portions 3716 extend around a portion of the base 3520 to space the
base 3520 apart from the distal end portion 3114 of the housing 3110. As shown in FIG.
26, the protrusions 3718 are configured engage a portion of the base 3520 to removably
couple the safety lock 3710 in its first position.
 [11841      One of the extended portions 3716 defines a recess 3720 that receives the
sheath retainer 3840 when the needle guard 3810 is in its first position, as discussed above.
Although only one extended portion 3716 is shown as including a recess 3720, in some
embodiments both extended portions 3716 can include a recess 3720 to receive the sheath
retainer 3840. In other embodiments, the safety lock 3710 can be engaged with the needle
 guard 3810 to prevent movement of the safety lock 3710 when the needle guard 3810 is in
 place in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, the sheath retainer can
 include protrusions that are received within corresponding openings defined by the safety
 lock.   In other embodiments, the safety lock can include protrusions that are received
 within corresponding openings defined by the sheath retainer.
 [11851       The first end 3712 of the safety lock 3710 includes a locking protrusion 3722
 that extends inwardly.     As shown in FIG. 26, when the safety lock 3710 is in its first
 position, the locking protrusion 3722 extends between the projections 3548 of the rod
 3540 and obstructs the opening 3522 of the base 3520. In this manner, when the safety
 lock 3710 is in its first position, the base 3520 cannot be moved proximally to allow the
 projections 3548 to be received within the opening 3522. The arrangement of the locking
 protrusion 3722 also prevents the projections 3548 from being moved inwardly towards
 each other.    Accordingly, when the safety lock 3710 is in its first position, the auto
 injector 3002 cannot be actuated.
  [11861      The outer surface 3724 of the first end 3712 of the safety lock 3710 includes a
 series of ridges 3726 to allow the user to more easily grip the safety lock 3710. The outer
 surface 3724 of the first end 3712 of the safety lock 3710 also includes an indicia 3728 to
 instruct the user in operating the auto-injector 3002.    As shown in FIG. 25, the indicia
 3728 includes a numeral to indicate the order of operation and an arrow to indicate the
 direction in which the safety lock 3710 should be moved. In some embodiments, the
 indicia 3728 can include different colors, detailed instructions or any other suitable indicia

  WO 2007/126851                                                      PCT/US2007/007626
                                           31
 to instruct the user. In other embodiments, the indidia 3728 can protrude from the safety
 lock 3710 to aid the user when grasping the safety lock 3710.
 [1187]      After being enabled, the auto-injector 3002 can then be actuated by moving the
 base 3520 proximally towards the housing 3110, as indicated by arrow I in FIG. 27. As
 shown in FIGS. 28 and 36, the base 3520 defines two openings 3536 that receive
 corresponding attachment protrusions 3150 disposed on the distal end portion 3114 of the
 housing 3110. In this manner, the-movement and/or alignment of the-base 3520 relative to
 the housing 3110 is guided by the attachment protrusions 3150 and the openings 3536 (see
FIG. 36).
 [1188]      Each attachment protrusion 3150 is secured within its corresponding opening
 3536 by a lock washer 3534. The lock washers 3534 each define an opening 3535 that
receives a portion of the attachment protrusion 3150. The lock washers 3534 are disposed
within slots 3533 defined by the base 3520 so that the openings 3535 are aligned with the
 attachment protrusions 3150. The openings 3535 are configured to allow the lock washers
 3534 to move proximally relative to the attachment protrusions 3150, but to prevent
movement of the lock washers 3534 distally relative to the attachment protrusions 3150.
In this manner, when the attachment protrusions 3150 are disposed within the openings
3535 of the lock washers 3534, the base 3520 becomes fixedly coupled to the housing
3110. Moreover, after the base 3520 is moved proximally relative to the housing 3110,
the lock washers 3534 prevent the base 3520 from returning to its initial position. Said
another way, the arrangement of the lock washers 3534 prevents the base 3520 from being
"kicked back" after the auto-injector 3002 has been actuated.
 [1189]      The base 3520 also defines a needle opening 3532, a recess 3526 and two
retraction spring pockets 3531. The needle opening 3532 receives a portion of the needle
guard 3810 when the needle guard is in its first position. Additionally, when the auto
injector is in its third configuration (see FIG. 37), the needle 3212 extends through the
needle opening 3532. As described above, the recess 3526 receives the corresponding
protrusion 3856 on the sheath retainer 3840 to removably couple the needle guard 3810 to
the base 3520. As will be described in more detail herein, the retraction spring pockets
3531 receive a portion of the retraction springs 3350.

  WO 2007/126851                                                      PCT/US2007/007626

 [11901     As shown in FIG. 28, the base 3520 includes two opposing tapered surfaces
 3524 that define an opening 3522 configured to receive a corresponding tapered surface
 3550 of the projections 3548 when the base is moved proximally towards the housing
 3110. When the projections 3548 are received within the tapered opening 3522, they are
 moved together as indicated by arrows J in FIG. 27.          The inward movement of the
 projections 3548 causes the rod 3540 to become disengaged from the spring retainer 3570,
 thereby allowing the rod 3540 to be moved proximally along its longitudinal axis as the
 spring 3560 expands.      A more detailed description of the components included in the
 system actuator 3510 is provided below with reference to FIGS. 29 and 30.
 [11911     The system actuator 3510 includes a rod 3540, a spring 3560 disposed about
 the rod 3540 and a spring retainer 3570. As described in more detail herein, the spring
retainer 3570 retains both the spring 3560 and the rod 3540. The spring retainer 3570
includes a first surface 3572, a second surface 3574 and a series of outwardly extending
engagement tabs 3576.        The spring retainer 3570 is disposed within the gas container
opening 3124 defined by the housing 3110 (see FIG. 36) such that the engagement tabs
3576 engage the interior surface 3123 of the housing 3110 to produce an interference fit.
In this manner, the spring retainer 3570 is fixedly disposed within the housing 3110.
 [11921       The rod 3540 has a proximal end portion 3542 and a distal end portion 3544.
The distal end portion 3544 of the rod 3540 includes two extensions 3552 disposed apart
from each other to define an opening 3554 therebetween. Each extension 3552 includes a
projection 3548 having a tapered surface 3550 and an engagement surface 3549. When
the rod 3540 is in its first (or engaged) position, the engagement surfaces 3549 engage the
second surface 3574 of the spring retainer 3570 to prevent the rod 3540 from moving
proximally along its longitudinal axis. As described above, when the base 3520 is moved
proximally towards the housing 3110, the tapered surfaces 3550 of the projections 3548
cooperate with the corresponding tapered surfaces 3524 of the base 3520 to move the
extensions 3552 inwardly towards each other. The inward motion of the extensions 3552
causes the engagement surfaces 3549 to become disengaged from the second surface 3574
of the spring retainer 3570, thereby allowing the rod 3540 to move between its first
position to a second (or actuated) position.
[11931      The proximal end portion 3542 of the rod 3540 includes a retention portion
3545 having a first surface 3547 and a second surface 3546. The first surface 3547 of the

  WO 2007/126851                                                      PCT/US2007/007626
                                            33
 retention portion 3545 engages the distal portion 3416 of the compressed gas container
 3412.    The second surface 3546 of the retention portion 3545 engages a proximal end
 3562 of the spring 3560.      Similarly, the first surface 3572 of the spring retainer 3570
 engages a distal end 3564 of the spring 3560. In this manner, when the rod 3540 is in its
 first position, the spring 3560 can be compressed between the spring retainer 3570 and the
 retention portion 3545 of the rod 3540. Accordingly, when the rod 3540 is disengaged
 from the spring retainer 3570, the force imparted by the spring 3560 on the retention
 portion 3545 of the rod 3540 causes the rod 3540 to move proximally into its second
 position.
 [1194]       The proximal end portion 3542 of the rod 3540 is coupled to the compressed
 gas container 3412 by a connector 3580, which is secured to the distal end portion 3416 of
 the compressed gas container 3412 by a securing member 3588.           The connector 3580
 includes a proximal end portion 3582 and a distal end portion 3584. The distal end portion
 3584 of the connector 3580 is disposed within the opening 3554 defined between the
 extensions 3552.     In this manner, the connector 3580 is retained by the proximal end
portion 3542 of the rod 3540. As will be described in more detail, the distal end portion
 3584 of the connector 3580 includes locking tabs 3587.
 [11951       The proximal end portion 3582 of the connector 3580 includes engagement
portions 3586 that engage the distal end portion 3416 of the compressed gas container
3412. The engagement portions 3586 are coupled to the compressed gas container 3412
by the securing member 3588, which can be, for example, a shrink wrap, an elastic band
or the like.      In other embodiments, the engagement portions 3586 can produce an
interference fit with the compressed gas container 3412, thereby eliminating the need for a
securing member 3588.
[11961        Because the rod 3540 is coupled to the compressed gas container 3412, when
the rod 3540 is moved from its first (engaged) position to its second (actuated) position,
the compressed gas container 3412 is moved proximally within the housing 3110 into
engagement with the gas release mechanism 3612. FIG. 31 shows the auto-injector in a
second configuration, in which the compressed gas container 3412 is engaged with the gas
release mechanism 3612.         When in the second configuration, the compressed gas
contained within the compressed gas container 3412 is released to actuate the medicament

injector 3210. A more detailed description of the gas release process is provided below
with reference to FIGS. 32 through 36.
[11971      FIG. 32 shows an exploded view of the system actuator 3510, the compressed
gas container 3412 and the gas release mechanism 3612, each of which are disposed
within the gas container opening 3124 defined by the housing 3110 (see FIG. 36). As
shown, the compressed gas container 3412, the system actuator 3510 and the gas release
mechanism 3612 are arranged substantially coaxial with each other.          As previously
discussed, when the auto-injector 3002 is actuated, the compressed gas container 3412 is
moved proximally within the gas container opening 3124 defined by the housing 3110, as
indicated by the arrow K in FIG. 32, until the proximal end 3414 of the compressed gas
container 3412 engages the gas release mechanism 3612.
[11981      As shown in FIGS. 33 and 34, the gas release mechanism 3612 includes a cap
3630 and a puncturing element 3620 coupled to and disposed within the cap 3630. The
puncturing element has a proximal end 3622 and a distal end 3624. The distal end 3624 of
the puncturing element 3620 defines a sharp point 3626 configured to puncture the
proximal end 3414 of the compressed gas container 3412. The puncturing element 3620
defines an opening 3627 extending from its distal end 3624 to its proximal end 3622.
[11991      The cap 3630 has a proximal end 3632, an outer surface 3635 and an inner
surface 3636.    The inner surface 3636 of the cap 3630 defines an opening 3634 that
receives the proximal end 3414 of the compressed gas container 3412 when the auto
injector 3002 is in its second configuration.   The proximal end 3632 of the cap 3630
defines an opening 3638 therethrough and a channel 3640 in fluid communication with the
opening 3638.     The opening 3638 receives the proximal end 3622 of the puncturing
element 3620 to couple the puncturing element 3620 to the cap 3630. The puncturing
element 3620 is disposed within the cap 3630 such that when the compressed gas
container 3412 is moved into the opening 3634, the distal end 3624 of the puncturing
element 3620 punctures the proximal end 3414 of the compressed gas container 3412.
 [12001     The cap 3630 is disposed within the gas container opening 3124 such that the
outer surface 3635 of the cap 3630 engages the inner surface 3123 of the housing 3110. In
some embodiments, the outer surface 3635 of the cap 3630 can be sized to produce an
interference fit with the inner surface 3123 of the housing 3110. In other embodiments,

                                         35
the cap 3630 can be fixedly coupled within the gas container opening 3124 using an
adhesive or any other suitable attachment mechanism.
[1201]      The cap 3630 is oriented within the gas container opening 3124 so that the
channel 3640 is aligned with and in fluid communication with the gas passageway 3126
defined by the housing 3110.      Moreover, when oriented in this manner, the protrusion
3642 on the proximal end 3632 of the cap 3630 obstructs a portion of the gas passageway
3126, which can be manufactured as a through-hole, to fluidically isolate the gas
passageway 3126 from an area outside of the housing 3110. After the proximal end 3414
of the compressed gas container 3412 has been punctured, pressurized gas flows from the
compressed gas container 3412 into the gas passageway 3126 through the opening 3627
defined by the puncturing element 3620 and the channel 3640 defined by the proximal end
3632 of the cap 3630.
 [1202]     The inner surface 3636 of the cap 3630 is configured to hermetically seal the
proximal end 3414 of the compressed gas container 3412 within the opening 3638. This
arrangement prevents pressurized gas from leaking around the compressed gas container
3412 to an area outside of the housing 3110 after the proximal end 3414 of the compressed
gas container 3412 has been punctured. In some embodiments, the inner surface 3636 is
sized to produce an interference fit with the compressed gas container 3412.      In other
embodiments, the cap 3630 includes a separate sealing member, such as, for example, an
o-ring, to seal the proximal end 3414 of the compressed gas container 3412 within the
opening 3638.
 [12031     After the compressed gas container 3412 is moved into engagement with the
gas release mechanism 3612, the position of the compressed gas container 3412 within the
gas container opening 3124 is maintained by the locking tabs 3587 on the connector 3580.
As shown in FIG. 29, each locking tab 3587 includes a pointed portion that is angled
outwardly from the connector 3580. This arrangement allows the connector 3580 to move
proximally within the gas container opening 3124 of the housing 3110, but prevents the
 connector 3580 from moving distally within the gas container opening 3124 of the housing
 3110.   Said another way, the arrangement of the locking tabs 3587 prevents the
 compressed gas container 3412 from being "kicked back" when exposed to the force
produced by the pressurized gas as the pressurized gas is released.

[1204]      As previously discussed, the pressurized gas released from the compressed gas
container 3412 produces a force on the boundary of the gas chamber 3120, including the
surface 3322 of the movable member 3312. This force causes the movable member 3312
and the medicament injector 3210 move together distally within the housing 3110, as
shown by arrow L, placing the auto-injector 3002 in a third configuration, as shown in
FIG. 37.    When in the third configuration, the distal end 3214 of the needle 3212 is
disposed through the opening 3532 defined by the base 3520 to an area outside of the
auto-injector 3002. Moreover, as shown in FIG. 38, when the auto-injector 3002 is in the
third configuration, the proximal end 3216 of the needle 3212 remains spaced apart from
the distal end 3266 of the medicament container 3210, ensuring that the needle 3212
remains fluidically isolated from the medicament container 3210.       In this manner, the
needle 3212 can be inserted into a patient as the auto-injector 3002 moves between its
second configuration (FIG. 31) and its third configuration (FIG. 37) without injecting the
medicament until after insertion is completed.       A more detailed description of the
medicament injector 3210 and the movable member 3312 is provided below with
reference to FIGS. 37 through 42.
[1205]      As previously described, the medicament injector 3210 includes a carrier 3250,
a medicament container 3262 and a needle 3212. The carrier 3250 has a lower portion
3222 and an upper portion 3252. The lower portion 3222 of the carrier 3250 includes a
needle hub 3223, which contains the needle 3212. The lower portion 3222 of the carrier
3250 also defines an opening 3224 configured to receive a distal portion 3266 the
medicament container 3262.      As shown in FIG. 39, the needle 3212 is coupled to the
needle hub 3223 such that the proximal end 3216 of the needle 3212 is disposed within the
opening 3224 and the distal end 3214 of the needle 3212 extends distally outside of the
needle hub 3223.
[1206]      The inner surface 3228 of the lower portion 3222 defining the opening 3224
includes a protrusion 3226. The protrusion 3226 is configured to engage a corresponding
recess 3272 defined by a sealing cap 3270 disposed at the distal portion 3266 of the
medicament container 3262 (see FIG. 42) to secure the medicament container 3262 within
the opening 3224 such that the proximal end 3216 of the needle 3212 is spaced apart from
the distal end 3266 of the medicament container 3210. The protrusion 3226 and the recess
3272 are configured such that the protrusion 3226 will become disengaged from the recess
3272 when the force applied exceeds a predetermined value.          Said another way, the

  protrusion 3226 and the recess 3272 collectively form a removable snap-fit that allows the
  medicament container 3262 to be moved within the opening 3224 when the force applied
  to the medicament container     3262 exceeds a predetermined value.     This arrangement
  ensures that the needle 3212 remains fluidically isolated from the medicament container
  3262 during the insertion operation.
  112071      The outer surface 3236 of the lower portion 3222 includes a protrusion 3238.
  As previously described, the protrusion 3238 is configured to engage a corresponding
  recess portion 3828 within the opening 3826 of the sheath 3820 (see FIG. 23) to
  removably couple the sheath 3820 to the needle hub 3223.
  [1208]      The lower portion 3222 of the carrier 3250 also defines two retraction spring
 pockets 3242 each receiving the proximal end 3352 of a retraction spring 3350.           As
 previously discussed, the distal end 3354 of each retraction spring 3350 is retained within
 the retraction spring pockets 3531 defined by the base 3520. As shown in FIG. 38, when
 the carrier 3250 moves distally within the housing 3110, the retraction springs 3350 are
 compressed and therefore bias the carrier 3250 towards the proximal portion 3112 of the
 housing 3110.
 [1209]      The upper portion 3252 of the carrier 3250 defines an opening 3256 configured
 to receive a proximal portion 3264 of the medicament container 3262 and includes two
 valve actuators 3254.    As described in more detail herein, the valve actuators 3254 are
 configured to engage a gas relief valve 3328 to allow the pressurized gas contained within
 the gas chamber 3120 to escape when the injection event is complete.
 [1210]      The upper portion 3252 of the carrier 3250 defines four gas relief passageways
 3258.    Similarly, the lower portion 3222 of the carrier 3250 defines four gas relief
passageways 3244. When the pressurized gas is released from the gas chamber 3120, the
gas relief passageways 3258, 3244 provide a fluid path to allow the pressurized gas to
flow from the gas chamber 3120 to an area outside of the housing 3110.
[1211]       As described above, the movable member 3312 includes a proximal end
portion 3316 and a distal end portion 3318. The distal end portion 3318 includes a piston
3324 disposed within the proximal portion 3264 of the medicament container 3262, such
that the piston engages a plunger 3284 contained within the medicament container 3262,
as shown in FIG. 42.

 WO 2007/126851                                                      PCT/US2007/007626

[1212]      The proximal end portion 3316 includes a surface 3322 that defines a portion
of a boundary of the gas chamber 3120. As shown in FIG. 41, the proximal end portion
3316 defines two openings 3326 therethrough, each of which are in fluid communication
between the gas chamber 3120 and the interior of the housing 3110 outside the gas
chamber 3120. The proximal end portion 3316 further defines a slot 3330 that receives a
gas relief valve 3328, which can be, for example, a flexible rubber member. The gas relief
valve 3328 is positioned within the slot 3330 and adjacent the openings 3326 to selectively
allow fluid communication between the gas chamber 3120 and the area outside the gas
chamber 3120 through the openings 3326. The operation of the gas relief valve 3328 is
discussed in more detail herein.
[12131      The proximal end portion 3316 of the movable member 3312 also includes a
seal 3314 that engages a portion the inner surface 3122 of the housing 3110 (see FIG. 36)
to fluidically isolate the gas chamber 3120. Although the seal 3314 is shown as being an
o-ring seal, in some embodiments, the seal need not be a separate component, but can
rather be a portion of the proximal end portion 3316 of the movable member 3312.
 [1214]      When the needle insertion operation is completed, the lower portion 3222 of
the carrier 3250 engages the base 3520, preventing further distal movement of the carrier
3250 within the housing. Because the distal motion of the carrier 3250 is opposed, the
force exerted by the pressurized gas on the surface 3322 of the movable member 3312
increases until the protrusion 3226 of the lower portion 3222 of the carrier 3250 and the
recess 3272 defined by sealing cap 3270 of the medicament container 3262 become
disengaged. Accordingly, the medicament container 3262 to moves distally relative to the
carrier 3250, placing the auto-injector 3002 in a fourth configuration, as shown in FIG. 43.
When moving between the third configuration (FIG. 38) and the fourth configuration
(FIG. 43), the proximal end 3216 of the needle 3212 pierces the sealing cap 3270 and the
liner 3271 disposed at the distal portion 3266 of the medicament container 3262. As such,
when in the fourth configuration, the proximal end 3216 of the needle 3212 is in fluid
communication with the medicament container 3262, thereby allowing the medicament to
be injected.
 [12151      Once the needle 3212 is in fluid communication with the medicament container
 3262, the force from the pressurized gas causes the piston 3324 of the movable member
 3312 to move the plunger 3284 within the medicament container 3262, as shown by arrow

 WO 2007/126851                                                         PCT/US2007/007626

M, thereby expelling the medicament through the needle 3212. The piston 3324 and the
plunger 3284 move a predetermined distance within the medicament container 3262,
placing the auto-injector 3002 in a fifth configuration, as shown in FIG. 44. When the
auto-injector 3002 is in the fifth configuration, the injection of medicament is complete.
[12161      When the auto-injector 3002 is in its fifth configuration, proximal portion 3316
of the movable member 3312 is in contact with the upper portion 3252 of the carrier 3250,
thereby preventing further movement of the piston 3324 within the medicament container
3262. In this manner, the distance through which the piston 3324 travels, and therefore
the amount of medicament injected, can be controlled.
[1217]      Additionally, when the auto-injector 3002 is in its fifth configuration, the valve
actuators 3254 are disposed within the openings 3326 such that the valve actuators 3254
displace the gas relief valve 3328. Accordingly, the pressurized gas contained within the
gas chamber 3120 can flow from the gas chamber 3120 to the area within the housing
3310 outside of the gas chamber 3310.              As previously discussed, the gas relief
passageways 3258, 3244 provide a fluid path to allow the pressurized gas to flow from the
gas chamber 3120, through the opening 3532 defined by the base 3520 and to an area
outside of the housing 3110.
[1218]      When the pressurized gas flows out of the gas chamber 3120, the pressure
exerted on the surface 3322 of the movable member 3312 decreases. Accordingly, the
force exerted by the retraction springs 3350 is sufficient to move the medicament injector
3210 and the movable member 3312 proximally within the housing 3110, as shown by
arrow N, into a sixth (or retracted) configuration as shown in FIG. 45.           Because the
medicament injector 3210 and the movable member 3312 move together, the valve
actuators 3254 remain disposed within the openings 3326 as the auto-injector 3002 moves
into the sixth configuration. In this manner, the gas relief valve 3328 remains displaced
and the openings 3326 remain in fluid communication with the gas chamber 3120 and the
area within the housing 3310 outside of the gas chamber 3310 independent of the position
of the movable member 3312. Such an arrangement ensures that all of the pressurized gas
flows out of the gas chamber 3120, thereby ensuring that the medicament injector 3210
and the movable member 3312 return to the sixth configuration and do not oscillate
between the sixth configuration and the fifth configuration, which could lead to the needle
3212 not being fully retracted into the housing 3110.

112231      Although the base 3520 of the auto-injector 3002 has been shown and
described covering almost the entire distal end portion 3114 of the housing 3110, in some
embodiments, a base configured to actuate the auto-injector can be disposed about only a
portion of the distal end of the housing.     For example, in some embodiments, an auto
injector can include a button extending from the distal end portion of the housing
configured to engage and release the system actuator.
[12241       Although the rod 3540 is shown and described as being an elongated member
that is released by being elastically deformed, in some embodiments, a rod can be of any
suitable shape and in any suitable orientation within the housing.      Moreover, in some
embodiments, a rod can be released by being plastically deformed. For example, in some
embodiments, a rod can be disposed along an axis that is offset from the longitudinal axis
of the energy storage member. In some embodiments, the rod can be configured to break
upon actuation.
 [12251      Although the gas release mechanism 3612 is shown and described as including
a puncturing element 3620 to puncture a portion of the compressed gas container 3262, the
gas release mechanism 3612 need not include a puncturing element 3620. For example, in
some embodiments, the gas release mechanism can include an actuator configured to
actuate a valve that controls the flow of gas out of the compressed gas container. For
example, in some embodiments, a compressed gas container can include a spring loaded
check ball and the gas release mechanism can include an actuator configured to engage
and depress the check ball to release pressurized gas from the compressed gas container.
 [12261      Although the distance through which the piston 3324 travels, and therefore the
amount of medicament injected, is shown and described as being controlled by
configuring the movable member 3312 such that it is in contact with the upper portion
3252 of the carrier 3250 when the auto-injector 3002 is in its fifth configuration, in other
 embodiments, any suitable method of controlling the piston travel can be employed. For
 example, in some embodiments, piston travel can be limited by including a protrusion
within the medicament container, such as a necked portion, that limits the motion of the
piston within the medicament container. In other embodiments, the housing can include a
protrusion to limit the motion of the movable member. In yet other embodiments, the
 valve actuator can be configured to actuate the gas relief valve when the piston has moved
 a predetermined distance within the medicament container. In yet other embodiments, a

combination of each of the above methods for controlling the piston travel can be
employed.
112271       Although the auto-injector 3002 is shown and described as having six different
configurations that are different from each other, in some embodiments, certain
configuration of an auto-injector can be the same as another configuration. For example,
in some embodiments, a "pre-actuation configuration can be the same as a "retracted"
configuration. In other embodiments, any of the functions described above can be
accomplished when an auto-injector is moved between any number of different
configurations.
 [12281      Although the auto-injector 3002 is shown and described as including a
compressed gas cylinder 3412, in other embodiments an auto-injector can include any
 suitable energy storage member. For example, in some embodiments, an auto-injector can
 include a mechanical energy storage member, such as a spring, an electrical energy storage
 member, such as a battery or a capacitor, a chemical energy storage member, such as a
 container containing two substances that can react to produce energy, a magnetic energy
 storage member or the like. Similarly, although the auto-injector 3002 is shown and
 described as including a gas release mechanism 3612, in other embodiments an auto
 injector can include any suitable energy release mechanism.           Such energy release
 mechanism can include, for example, an electrical circuit, a mechanical spring retainer, a
 fluid control valve or the like.

 112461      FIGS. 46 and 47 are a perspective view and a partial cutaway front view,
respectively, of an auto-injector 7002 according to an embodiment of the invention. The
 auto-injector 7002 is similar to the auto-injectors described in U.S. Patent Application
 Serial Number 11/562,061, entitled "Devices, Systems and Methods for Medicament
 Delivery," filed November 21, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference in its
 entirety.  Accordingly, only an overview of the mechanical components and related
 operation of the auto-injector 7002 is included below.
 112471       The auto-injector 7002 includes a housing 7110 that defines a gas chamber
 7120. The housing 7110 has a proximal end portion 7112 and a distal end portion 7114.
 A base 7520 is movably coupled to the distal end portion 7114 of the housing 7110. A
 safety lock 7710 is removably coupled to the base 7520. As discussed in more detail
 herein, when the safety lock 7710 is coupled to the base 7520, the auto-injector 7002
 cannot be actuated. When the safety lock 7710 is removed from the base 7520, the base
 7520 can be moved relative to the housing 7110, thereby actuating the auto-injector 7002.
 Accordingly, to inject a medicament into the body, the distal end portion 7114 of the
 housing 7110 is oriented towards the user such that the base 7520 is in contact with the
 portion of the body where the injection is to be made.       The base 7520 is then moved
 towards the proximal end 7112 of the housing 7110 to actuate the auto-injector 7002.
  112481     The auto-injector 7002 includes a medicament injector 7210 and a system
 actuator 7510 disposed non-coaxially within the housing 7110. The medicament injector
 7210 includes multiple medicament vials 7262, a plunger 7284 movably disposed within
 each medicament vial 7262, a movable member 7312 engaged with each plunger 7284 and
 a needle 7212. Retraction springs 7350 located within a portion of the base 7520 and the
 housing 7110 can push the needle 7212 back within the housing 7110 after injection. The
 system actuator 7510 includes a compressed spring 7560, a compressed gas cylinder 7412,
  and a puncturing mechanism 7612 to dispel the contents of the compressed gas cylinder
  7412.

[1249]      In use, when the auto-injector 7002 is actuated, the puncturing mechanism
7612 punctures the compressed gas cylinder 7412 allowing a pressurized gas to flow into
the gas chamber 7120.      In response to a force produced by the pressurized gas on the
movable member 7312, the movable member 7312 moves distally within the housing
7110. As a result, the needle 7212 is extended through the housing 7110. The movement
of the movable member 7312 also causes the plungers 7284 to move within the vials 7262,
thereby expelling a medicament from the vials 7262.
[1250]      The auto-injector 7002 includes an electronic circuit system 7920 to provide a
predetermined sequence of electronic outputs during the use of the auto-injector 7002.
The electronic circuit system 7920 is powered by a battery (not shown in FIGS. 46 and 47)
and includes a processor (not shown in FIGS. 46 and 47), a start button 7970, two switches
7972A and 7972B, a proximity sensor 7974, two visual output devices 7958A and 7958B
and an audio output device 7956. The components of the electronic circuit system 7920
are operatively coupled by any suitable mechanism, such as, for example, a printed circuit
board (not shown in FIGS. 46 and 47) having conductive traces.
[1251]      The start button 7970 is disposed on the proximal end of the housing 7110 and
can be manually actuated by the user to begin the sequence of electronic outputs. The first
switch 7972A is disposed on the distal portion 7114 of the housing 7110 adjacent the base
7520 and the locking member 7710. The locking member 7710 is configured to engage
the first switch 7972A such that when the locking member 7710 is removed, as shown in
FIG. 46, the first switch 7972A changes states. In this manner, removal of the locking
member 7710 can trigger the processor to output a predetermined electronic output.
[12521      Similarly, the second switch 7972B is disposed on the housing 7110 adjacent
the medicament injector 7210. The medicament injector 7210 is configured to engage the
second switch 7972B such that when the medicament injector 7210 is moved distally
within the housing 7110 the second switch 7972B changes states.         In this manner, the
processor can be prompted to output a predetermined electronic output based on the
position of the medicament injector 7210.
[1253]      The proximity sensor 7974 is disposed on the base 7520 and is configured to
produce an output when the base 7520 engages the body. The proximity sensor can be, for
example, a temperature sensor, an optical sensor or the like. In this manner, the processor

                                            50
 can be prompted to output a predetermined electronic output when the base 7520 is
 positioned against the body.
 [12541       The first visual output device 7958A is disposed on the locking member 7710.
 Similarly, the second visual output device 7958B is disposed on the outer surface 7111 of
 the housing 7110.       The visual output devices 7958A and 7958B are in electronic
 communication with the processor and are configured to produce an output in response to
 an electronic signal output by the processor. The visual output devices 7958A and 7958B
 can be any suitable visual indicia, such as, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), liquid-crystal
 display (LCD) screens, optical polymers, fiber optic components or the like. In some
 embodiments, the visual output devices 7958A and 7958B can be coupled to the housing
 7110 and/or the locking member 7710 by a label 7910.
 [12551      The audio output device 7956 is disposed within the housing 7110 such that it
 can project sound outside of the housing 7110. The audio output device 7956 can be any
 suitable device for producing sound, such as a micro-speaker a piezo-electric transducer or
 the like. Such sound output can include, for example, an alarm, a series of beeps, recorded
 speech or the like. The audio output device 7956 is in electronic communication with the
processor and is configured to produce an output in response to an electronic signal output
by the processor.
 [1256]     In use, the user activates the electronic circuit system by pushing the start
button 7970 to activate the processor, thereby causing the processor to output a
predetermined sequence of electronic outputs.      In some embodiments, the start button
7970 can activate the processor by providing an input to the processor.              In other
embodiments, the start button 7970 can activate the processor by placing the battery (not
shown in FIGS. 46 and 47) in electronic communication with the processor.
112571      In some embodiments, upon activation, the processor can output an electronic
signal to the audio output device 7956 thereby producing a first electronic output
instructing the user in how to use the auto-injector 7002. Such a message can state, for
example,' "please remove the safety tab."       Additionally, the first visual output device
7958A can produce a flashing light to further indicate to the user where the locking
member 7710 is located.        The processor can be configured to repeat the first audible

  period.
  [1258]      When the user removes the locking member 7710, the first switch 7972A
  changes states thereby triggering the processor to output an electronic output providing a
  second instruction to the user. The second instruction can be, for example, an audible
  speech output instructing the user to "please place the base of the device on the outer
  portion of your thigh." The-first visual output device 7958A can produce a lighted output
  during this audible instruction, thereby visually indicating where the base 7520 is located
  and/or what portion of the base 7520 should be placed on the thigh.
  [1259]       When the user places the base 7520 against the body, the proximity sensor
  1974 provides an input to the processor, thereby triggering the processor to output an
  electronic output providing a third instruction to the user. The third instruction can be, for
 example, an audible speech output instructing the user to "push down on the top of the
 device to activate the injector."
 [12601      When the injection is completed, the medicament injector 7210 is configured to
 engage the second switch 7972B, thereby triggering the processor to output an electronic
 output providing a fourth instruction to the user. Such a post-use instruction can be, for
 example, an audible speech output instructing the user to seek further medical attention,
providing instructions for the safe disposal of the auto-injector 7002 or the like.
 [1261]      FIG. 48 is a schematic illustration of the electronic circuit system 7920 of the
auto-injector 7002. The electronic circuit system 7920 includes a processor 7950
operatively coupled to a memory device 7954. The memory device 7954 can be
configured to store processor-readable code 7955 instructing the processor 7950 to
perform the functions described above. In some embodiments, the processor-readable
code 7955 can be modified and/or updated as circumstances dictate. The electronic circuit
system 1920 includes an input/output device 7952 configured to receive electronic inputs
from the switches 7972A and 7972B, the proximity sensor 7974 and/or the start button
7970. The input/output device 7952 is also configured to provide electronic signals to the
various output devices, such as the visual output devices 7958A and 7958B and the audio
output device 7956.

[12621       The electronic circuit system 7920 also includes a network interface 7953
configured to couple the electronic circuit system 7920 to a communications network.
Such an arrangement can be used, for example, to download replacement processor
readable code 7955 from a central network (not shown) to the memory device 7954. The
network interface 7953 can also be configured to transmit information from the electronic
circuit system 7920 to a central network, the user's home computer, the user's cell phone
or the like.
[1263]       FIG. 49 is a schematic illustration of a medical device 8002 according to an
embodiment of the invention. The medical device 8002, which can be, for example, a
medicament delivery device such as an auto-injector, a pen injector, an inhaler, a
transdermal delivery system or the like, includes a housing 8110 and a label 8910. The
label 8910 is coupled to an outer surface 8111 of the housing 8110.         The label 8910
includes a first surface 8912, a second surface 8914 and an electronic circuit system 8920.
The first surface 8912 is configured to engage the outer surface 8111 of the housing 8110
to couple the label 8910 to the housing 8110. In some embodiments, the first surface 8912
can include an adhesive to fixedly couple the label 8910 to the housing 8110. The second
surface 8914 includes a textual indicia 8916. The textual indicia 8916 can include, for
example, a description of the medicament delivery device, a source of the medicament
delivery device and/or an instruction associated with the use of the medicament delivery
device. Although the first surface 8912 is shown as being opposite the second surface
8914, in other embodiments, the first surface 8912 and the second surface 8914 can be
adjacent each other and/or co-planar.
[12641       The electronic circuit system 8920 is configured to output an electronic signal.
As discussed in more detail herein, the electronic circuit system 8920 can include many
components, such as, for example, a processor, a switch, a visual output device and/or an
audio output device.     The electronic signal can be, for example, an electronic signal
communicated to an output device, such as, for example, a visual output device, an audio
output device, a haptic output device or the like. In some embodiments, the electronic
signal can be associated with an aspect of the medical device 8002, such as an instruction
associated with an initial use of the medical device 8002.          For example, in some
embodiments, the electronic circuit system 8920 can output a text message to a display
screen (not shown) disposed on the medical device 8002 instructing the user in the use of
the medical device 8002. In other embodiments, the electronic circuit system 8920 can

second surface 8914 of the label 8910, in other embodiments, the electronic circuit system
can be disposed on the first surface 8912 of the label 8910. In yet other embodiments, the
electronic circuit system 8920 can be disposed between the first surface 8912 and the
second .surface 8914 of the label 8910. In yet other embodiments, the label 8910 can
include multiple discrete layers coupled together, within which portions of the electronic
circuit system can be disposed.
                                                                                        to an
 112661      FIG. 50 is a perspective view of an auto-injector 4002 according
 embodiment of the invention. The auto-injector 4002 is similar to the auto-injectors
 described in U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 11/562,061, entitled "Devices,
                                                                             2006, which is
 Systems and Methods for Medicament Delivery," filed November 21,
 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Accordingly, the mechanical components
 and operation of the auto-injector 4002 are not described in detail herein.
 [12671      The auto-injector 4002 includes a housing 4110 having a proximal end portion
 4112 and a distal end portion 4114. The distal end portion 4114 of the housing 4110
 includes a protrusion 4142 to help a user grasp and retain the housing 4110 when using the
 auto-injector 4002. Said another way, the protrusion 4142 is configured to prevent the
  auto-injector 4002 from slipping from the user's grasp during use. A base 4520 is
  movably coupled to the distal end portion 4114 of the housing 4110. A needle guard
  assembly 4810 is removably coupled to the base 4520. Similarly, a safety lock 4710 is
  removably coupled to the base 4520. To inject a medicament into the body, the distal end
                                                                                   4520 is in
  portion 4114 of the housing is oriented towards the user such that the base
  contact with the portion of the body where the injection is to be made. The base 4520 is
  then moved towards the proximal end 4112 of the housing 4110 to actuate the auto
  injector 4002.
  [1268]      The auto-injector 4002 includes a label 4910 coupled to an outer surface 4111
  of the housing 4110. The label 4910 includes an outer layer 4911, an intermediate layer
  4980 and an electronic circuit system 4920 (see FIGS. 52 - 54). FIG. 51 is a front view of
  the auto-injector 4002 showing the outer layer 4911 of the label 4910 in phantom lines so

    WO 2007/126851                                                       PCT/US2007/007626
                                              54
that the intermediate layer 4980 and an electronic circuit system 4920 can be more clearly
seen. As shown in FIGS. 52 - 54, the outer layer 4911, which, in some embodiments, can
be constructed from paper, has a first surface 4912 and a second surface 4914 opposite the
first surface 4912. Multiple indicia 4916 are disposed on the first surface 4912. The
indicia 4916 include a textual indicia 4916A and two symbolic indicia 4916B. The textual
 indicia 4916B can be written text describing the medicament delivery device, indicating a
 source of the medicament delivery device and/or instructing a user in the use of the
medicament delivery device.         The symbolic indicia 4916B can include, for example,
 arrows, pointers, trademarks, symbols describing the use of the medicament delivery
 device or the like. The label 4910 is coupled to the outer surface 4111 of the housing 4110
 such that the portion of the first surface 4912 including the indicia 4916 is visible.
 [12691      A portion of the second surface 4914 of the outer layer 4911 can be coupled to
 the outer surface 4111 of the housing 4110 by any suitable method. For example, in some
 embodiments, the second surface 4914 of the outer layer 4911 includes an adhesive
 configured to bond the outer layer 4911 to the outer surface 4111 of the housing 4110.
 Other portions of the second surface 4914 of the outer layer 4911 are adjacent the
 intermediate layer 4980 and portions of the electronic circuit system 4920. In this manner,
  the outer layer 4911 of the label 4910 retains the intermediate, or spacer, layer 4980 and
  the electronic circuit system 4920 in a predetermined position against the outer surface
  4111 of the housing 4110.
  [1270]      The outer layer 4911 of the label 4910 includes multiple openings 4917
  adjacent the audio output device 4956.        In this manner, sound waves produced by the
  audio output device 4956 can be transmitted to an area outside of the housing 4110.
  Similarly, the outer layer 4911 of the label 4910 includes openings 4918 adjacent the light
  emitting diodes (LEDs) 4958A and 4958B to allow the user to see the visual output. In
  some embodiments, the outer layer 4911 of the label 4910 can include a transparent
  portion adjacent the LEDs 4958A and 4958B to allow the user to see the visual output.
   [12711     The electronic circuit system 4920 includes a printed circuit board 4922 upon
  which a microprocessor 4950, two LEDs 4958A and 4958B, two switches 4972A and
  4972B and various electronic components 4951, such as, for example, resistors, capacitors
  and diodes, are mounted. The electronic circuit system 4920 also includes an audio output
  device 4956, such as, for example, a micro-speaker, coupled to the outer surface 4111 of

  WO 2007/126851                                                       PCT/US2007/007626
                                             55
the housing 4110 adjacent the printed circuit board 4922. The printed circuit board 4922
includes a substrate 4924 upon which a series of electrical conductors 4934, such as for
example, copper traces, are etched.        The substrate 4924 can be constructed from any
material having suitable electrical properties, mechanical properties and flexibility, such
as, for example Mylar@, Kapton@ or impregnated paper.
 [12721      A mask layer (not shown) is disposed over the substrate 4924 to electrically
isolate selected -portions of the electrical conductors-4934 from adjacent components, The
electrical conductors 4934 operatively couple the above-mentioned circuit components in
a predetermined arrangement. In this manner, the electronic circuit system 4920 can be
configured to output, via the LEDs 4958A and 4958B and/or the audio output device
4956, a predetermined sequence of electronic outputs during the use of the auto-injector
4002.
 [12731      Power is supplied to the electronic circuit system 4920 by two batteries 4962
 connected in series. The batteries can be, for example, three volt, "watch-style" lithium
 batteries. As shown in FIG. 54, each of the batteries 4962 has a first surface 4964 and a
 second surface 4966 opposite the first surface. The first surface 4964 can be, for example,
 an electrically negative terminal. Similarly, the second surface 4966 can be an electrically
 positive terminal. As discussed in more detail herein, the batteries 4962 are positioned
 such that a first electrical contact portion 4936 of the printed circuit board 4922 can be
 placed in contact with the first surface 4964 of the battery 4962 and a second electrical
 contact portion 4938 of the printed circuit board 4922 can be placed in contact with the
 second surface 4966 of the battery 4962.         In this manner, the batteries 4962 can be
 operatively coupled to the electronic circuit system 4920.
  [1274]     As shown in FIGS. 52 and 54, a battery isolation tab 4860 is movably disposed
 between the first electrical contact portion 4936 of the printed circuit board 4922 and the
 first surface 4964 of one of the batteries 4962.      The battery isolation tab 4860 can be
 constructed from any electrically isolative material, such as, for example, Mylar. As
 discussed in more detail herein, in this manner, the batteries 4962 can be selectively
 placed in electronic communication with the electronic circuit system 4920.
  [1275]     The intermediate, or spacer, layer 4980 is disposed between the outer layer
  4911 and the electronic circuit system 4920.         The intermediate layer 4980 includes

   WO 2007/126851                                                      PCT/US2007/007626
                                              56
  openings (not shown) within which various components of the electronic circuit system,
  such as, for example, the batteries 4962 are disposed. The intermediate layer 4980 is sized
  to maintain a predetermined spacing between the various components included in the label
  4910. The intermediate layer can be constructed from any suitable material, such as, for
  example, flexible foam having an adhesive surface, polycarbonate or the like.
  [1276]      FIG. 55 is a front view of the electronic circuit system 4920 showing the
  arrangement of the various components (i.e., the microprocessor 4950, LEDs 4958A and
 4958B, switches 4972A and 4972B, audio output device 4956 or the like). FIG. 56 is a
  schematic illustration of the electronic circuit system 4920.
  [1277]     The operation of the auto-injector 4002 and the electronic circuit system 4920
 is now discussed with reference to FIGS. 57 - 59. The actuation of the electronic circuit
 system 4920 includes several operations that are incorporated into the standard procedures
 for using the auto-injector 4002. In this manner, the user can actuate the electronic circuit
 system 4920 without completing any additional operations.
 [1278]      Prior to use, the auto-injector 4002 is first enabled by removing the needle
 guard 4810 and the safety lock 4710 (see FIGS. 57 and 58). As illustrated by arrow AA in
 FIG. 57, the needle guard 4810 is removed by moving it distally. The needle guard 4810
 includes a sheath retainer 4840 and a sheath 4820.         The sheath 4820 is configured to
 receive a portion of the needle (not shown) when the needle guard 4810 is in a first (or
 installed) position. The sheath retainer 4840 is coupled to the sheath 4820 such that when
 the sheath retainer 4840 is moved distally away from the base 4520 into a second (or
removed) position, the sheath 4820 is removed from the needle.
 [12791      The sheath retainer 4840 includes an actuator 4864 that is received by an
opening 4862 in the isolation tab 4860. Accordingly, when the sheath retainer 4840 is
moved distally away from the base 4520, the isolation tab 4860 is removed from the area
between the first electrical contact portion 4936 of the printed circuit board 4922 and the
first surface 4964 of one of the batteries 4962. In this manner, the batteries 4962 can be
operatively coupled to the electronic circuit system 4920 when the needle guard 4810 is
removed, thereby actuating the electronic circuit system 4920.
112801       When actuated, the electronic circuit system 4920 can output one or more
predetermined electronic outputs. For example, in some embodiments, the processor 4950

  WO 2007/126851                                                         PCT/US2007/007626
                                             57
 can output an electronic signal associated with recorded speech to the audible output
 device 4956. Such an electronic signal can be, for example, associated with a .WAV file
 that contains a recorded instruction instructing the user in the operation of the auto-injector
 4002.    Such an instruction can state, for example, "remove the blue safety tab near the
 base of the auto-injector." The processor can simultaneously output an electronic signal to
 the first LED 4958A, thereby causing the first LED 4958A, which is located near the
 safety lock 4710, to flash a particular color. In this manner, the electronic circuit system
 4920 can provide both audible and visual instructions to assist the user in the initial
 operation of the auto-injector 4002.
 [12811        In other embodiments, the electronic circuit system 4920 can output an
 electronic output associated with a description and/or status of the auto-injector 4002
 and/or the medicament contained therein. For example, in some embodiments, electronic
circuit system 4920 can output an audible message indicating the type of medicament
contained in the auto-injector, the expiration date of the medicament, the dosage of the
medicament or the like.
 [1282]       As illustrated by arrow BB in FIG. 58, the safety lock 4710 is removed by
moving it substantially normal to the longitudinal axis of the housing 4110. The safety
lock 4710 has a first end 4712 and a second end 4714. When the safety lock 4710 is in its
first (or locked) position, the second end 4714 extends around a portion of the base 4520
to space the base 4520 apart from the distal end portion 4114 of the housing 4110.
Additionally, the first end 4714 includes a locking protrusion (not shown) that obstructs
portions of the system actuator (not shown) further preventing the base 4520 from being
moved proximally towards the housing 4110. Accordingly, when the safety lock 4710 is
in its first position, the auto-injector 4002 cannot be actuated.
[1283]        In some embodiments, the safety lock 4710 includes an actuator 4732 that
actuates the electronic circuit 4920 to trigger a predetermined output or sequence of
outputs when the safety lock 4710 is moved from the first position to a second (or
unlocked) position, as shown in FIG. 58. More particularly, as shown in FIGS. 55, 60 and
61, the actuator 4732 includes a protrusion 4730 that is received within a first opening
4928A defined by an actuation portion 4926 of the substrate 4924 when the safety lock
4710 is in the first position.       The boundary 4929 of the first opening 4928A has a
discontinuous shape, such as, for example, a teardrop shape, that includes a stress

                                                            electronically couples the components
 electrical conductor 4934 that, as discussed above,
                                                        The electrical conductor 4934 includes a
 included in the electronic circuit -system 4920.

 first switch 4972A, which can be, for example
                                                              is moved from the first position to the
 conductor 4934. In use, when the safety lock 4710
                                                                                     parallel to a plane
  second position, the actuator 4732 moves in a direction substantially
                                                          of the substrate 4924. The movement of

    electronic outputs. For example, in some embodiments,

     4920 can output an audible message further instructing
                                                              for example, "Place the base of the auto-

  injector against the patient's thigh.    To complete the injection, press the base firmly
  against the patient's thigh."   In some embodiments, the processor can simultaneously
  output an electronic signal to the second LED 4958B, thereby causing the second LED
  4958B, which is located near the base 4520, to flash a particular color. In this manner, the
  electronic circuit system 4920 can provide both audible and visual instructions to assist the
  user in the placement and actuation of the auto-injector 4002. In some embodiments, the
  electronic circuit system 4920 can be configured to repeat the instructions after a
  predetermined time period has elapsed.
  112871      After the auto-injector 4002 is enabled and placed against the body of the
 patient, the auto-injector 4002 is actuated by moving the base 4520 proximally towards the
 housing 4110, as illustrated by arrow CC in FIG. 59. The base 4520 includes an actuator
 4538 that actuates the electronic circuit 4920 to trigger a predetermined output or sequence
 of outputs when the base 4520 is moved from a first position to a second position, as
 shown in FIG. 58. The actuator 4538 includes a protrusion 4539 that is received within a
 second opening 4928B (see FIG. 55) defined by the substrate 4924 when the base 4520 is
 in the first position. The configuration and operation of the protrusion 4539, the second
 opening 4928B and the second switch 4972B are similar to the configuration and
 operation of the protrusion 4730, the first opening 4928A and the first switch 4972A, and
 are therefore not described in detail.
 [12881       When the actuator 4538 actuates the electronic circuit system 4920, the
 electronic circuit system 4920 can output one or more predetermined electronic outputs.
For example, in some embodiments, the processor 4950 can output an electronic signal
associated with recorded speech to the audible output device 4956. Such an electronic
signal can be, for example, associated with a recorded message notifying the user that the
injection is complete, instructing the user on post-injection disposal and safety
                                                                                   procedures,
instructing the user on post-injection medical treatment or the like. Such a status message
can state, for example, "The injection is now complete. Please seek further medical
attention from a doctor."     The processor can also simultaneously output an electronic
signal to the first LED 4958A, thereby causing the first LED 4958A to stop
                                                                                      flashing,
change color or the like, to provide a visual indication that the injection is complete.
[1289]       As described above, the batteries 4962 are positioned such that the first
electrical contact portions 4936 of the printed circuit board 4922 can be placed in contact

with the first surface 4964 of each battery 4962 and the second electrical contact portion
4938 of the printed circuit board 4922 can be placed in contact with the second surface
4966 of each battery 4962.       As shown in FIGS. 55 and 62, the first electrical contact
portions 4936 each include a pair of electrical contacts 4937 that are operatively coupled
to the electronic circuit system 4920. Similarly, the second electrical contact portion 4938
includes a pair of electrical contacts 4939 that is operatively coupled to the electronic
circuit system 4920.
[12901       The first electrical contact portions 4936 and the second electrical contact
portion 4938 are monolithically constructed from the printed circuit board 4922. FIGS. 62
- 65 are perspective views showing the printed circuit board 4922 in various stages of
manufacture.     FIG. 66 is a flow chart illustrating a method 5000 for manufacturing a
flexible printed circuit board according to an embodiment of the invention. The illustrated
method includes disposing a copper layer on the top surface 4925 of the flexible substrate
 4924 and etching the desired series of electrical conductors (not shown in FIGS. 62-65) at
 5002.   A mask layer (not shown) is disposed on portions of the top layer 4925 of the
 substrate 4924 to electrically isolate selected portions of the electrical conductors from
 adjacent components at 5004. During this operation, the electrical contacts 4937, 4939 are
 constructed.
 [12911      The printed circuit board 4922 is then populated with the microprocessor,
 switches, output devices and/or other electronic components to form the electronic circuit
 system 4920 at 5006. For clarity, the circuit components are not shown in FIGS. 62 - 65.
 After the printed circuit board 4922 is populated, the portion of the flexible substrate 4924
 forming the second electrical contact portion 4938 is separated from the remainder of the
 substrate 4924 at 5008. As shown in FIG. 62, during this operation, a portion 4923 of the
 boundary between the second electrical contact portion 4938 and the remainder of the
 substrate 4924 is left intact.
 [12921       As shown by the arrow EE in FIG. 63, the second electrical contact portion
 4938 is then moved upwardly away from the remainder of the substrate 4924 at 5010. In
 this manner, the second electrical contact portion 4938 is spaced apart from the first
 electrical contact portions 4936. As shown by the arrow FF in FIG. 64, the portion of the
 second electrical contact portion 4938 containing the electrical contacts 4939 is then
 folded so that the electrical contacts 4939 on the second electrical contact portion 4938 are

facing the electrical contacts 4937 on the first electrical contact portions 4936, at 5012. In
this manner, opposing electrical contacts 4937, 4939 are constructed on the printed circuit
board 4922 without disposing electrical conductors on and/or etching multiple surfaces of
the printed circuit board 4922.
 [12931       The batteries 4962 are then disposed between the first electrical contact
                                                                                     not shown
portions 4936 and the second electrical contact portion 4938 at 5014. Although
in-FIG. 64, -in some embodiments, a battery isolation tab of the type discussed above can
 be disposed between one of the batteries and the printed circuit board 4922. Once the
 batteries 4962 are in place, the top layer 4911 of the label 4910 is disposed about the
                                                                                           4962
 printed circuit board 4922 (see FIG. 65) to maintain the position of the batteries
 within the printed circuit board 4922, at 5016. The label assembly 4910 is then coupled to
 the outer surface of the housing (not shown) at 5018. The label 4910 is coupled to the
 housing with sufficient tension and/or stretch to maintain the electrical contacts 4937 in
  electrical communication with the first surface 4964 of each battery 4962 and to maintain
  the electrical contacts 4939 in electrical communication with the second surface 4966 of
  each battery 4962.     In this manner, the batteries 4962 can be held in place in a printed
  circuit board 4922 devoid of springs, clips or other rigid members.
   112941      As described above, the audio output device 4956, can include, for example, a
  micro-speaker. In some embodiments, for example, the audio output device 4956 can
  include an RS-151 IA micro-speaker manufactured by Regal Electronics, Inc.
   [1295]      Similarly, the microprocessor 4950 can be a commercially-available processing
   device dedicated to performing one or more specific tasks. For example, in some
   embodiments, the microprocessor 4950 can be a commercially-available microprocessor,
   such as the Sonix SNC 12060 voice synthesizer. Alternatively, the microprocessor 4950
   can be an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a combination of ASICs, which
   are designed to perform one or more specific functions. In yet other embodiments, the
   microprocessor 4950 can be an analog or digital circuit, or a combination of multiple
   circuits.

   In some embodiments, the electronic circuit system
                                                             is placed on the outer surface of the

  WO 2007/126851                                                     PCT/US2007/007626
                                          63
intravenous (IV) bag or the like. The illustrated method includes assembling the medical
device, 5062.    The medical device is then sterilized using any suitable sterilization
process, 5064. In some embodiments, for example, such as those embodiments in which
the medicament is epinephrine, the medical device can be sterilized by exposure to
ethylene oxide (EtO) gas. In other embodiments, the medical device can be sterilized by
exposure to gamma radiation.      In yet other embodiments, the medical device can be
sterilized by exposure to heat, such as for example, by placing the medicament delivery
device into an autoclave.
[13001      In parallel with the manufacture of the medical device, the illustrated method
includes constructing an electronic circuit system of the type shown and described above,
5066.    The electronic circuit system is then coupled to a label, 5068, to form a label
assembly.    Because the circuit construction is done apart from the manufacture of the
medicament delivery device, it is not subjected the sterilization process, which, in some
instances, may damage the circuit components.
 [13011     The illustrated method then includes placing the label assembly on the outer
surface of the medical device, 5070.     The label assembly is then coupled to the outer
surface of the medical device, 5072.    In some embodiments, the label assembly can be
coupled to the medicament delivery device by an adhesive, an elastic fastener, a shrink
wrap or any other suitable method.
[1302]      While various embodiments of the invention are described herein, it should be
understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation.
Where methods described above indicate certain events occurring in certain order, the
ordering of certain events may be modified. Additionally, certain of the events may be
performed concurrently in a parallel process when possible, as well as performed
sequentially as described above.
 [1303]     For example, although the first surface 4912 of the top layer 4911 of the label
4910 is shown and described as being opposite the second surface 4914 of the top layer
4911 of the label 4910, in other embodiments, the first surface 4912 and the second
surface 4914 can be adjacent each other and/or co-planar.       Similarly, although the top
layer 4911 of the label 4910 is shown and described as covering substantially all of the

   WO 2007/126851                                                     PCT/US2007/007626
                                              64
housing 4110, in some embodiments, the top layer 4911 of the label 4910 can cover only a
portion of the housing.
[13041      Although the label 4910 is shown and described as including a top layer 4911,
an intermediate layer 4980 and a printed circuit board 4922, in some embodiments, the
layers comprising the label 4910 can be arranged in any suitable order. For example, in
some embodiments, a multi-layered label can include a printed circuit board as an
intermediate layer.     In other embodiments, a multi-layered label can include a printed
circuit board as the outer layer. Moreover, in yet other embodiments, the label need not
include multiple layers. For example, in some embodiments, a label can include a single
layer that includes an electronic circuit system and textual indicia.
 [1305]      Although the indicia 4916 are shown and described as being visible (e.g.,
textual indicia and/or symbolic indicia), in some embodiments, a label can include indicia
that are haptic. For example, in some embodiments a label can include Braille. In other
 embodiments, a label can include indicia having a distinct feel, such as for example, a
 particularly rough or smooth surface.
 [13061      Although the electronic circuit system 4920 is shown and described as
 including a printed circuit board 4922 having a flexible substrate 4924, in other
 embodiments, an electronic circuit system can include a rigid printed circuit board. In yet
 other embodiments, an electronic circuit system can include a printed circuit board having
 a substrate having at least a rigid portion.
  [1307]      Moreover, in some embodiments, an electronic circuit system need not include
 a printed circuit board. For example, in some embodiments, an electronic circuit system
  can include electronic components operatively coupled by any suitable method other than
 by a printed circuit board.
  [1308]      Similarly, although the components included in the electronic circuit system
  4920 (e.g., the microprocessor 4950, the LEDs 4958A and 4958B or the like) are shown
  and described as being operatively coupled by electrical conductors 4934, in other
  embodiments, the components can be operatively coupled without being physically
  connected.    For example, in some embodiments, at least a portion of the components
  included   in an electronic circuit system can be inductively        coupled.     In other

     WO 2007/126851                                                       PCT/US2007/007626
                                              65
    embodiments, at least a portion of the components included in an electronic circuit system
   can be evanescently coupled.
    [13091     Although the switches 4972A and 4972B are shown and described as being
   "tear-through" switches that are monolithically formed from the electrical conductors
   4934, in other embodiments, a switch can be formed separately from the electrical
   conductors 4934.     For example, in some embodiments, an electrical circuit system can
   include a series of first electrical conductors having a first set of characteristics (e.g., the
   width, height, material from which the conductor is fabricated or the like) and a switch
   constructed from a second electrical conductor having a second set of characteristics
  different than the first set of characteristics.  In other embodiments, a switch can be a
  separate component, such as, for example, a microswitch, that is mounted to the printed
  circuit board. In yet other embodiments, an electrical circuit system can include a "pop
  out" switch that includes a biasing member to bias the switch in a predetermined state. In
  yet other embodiments, an electrical circuit system can include a switch that is disposed at
  a location other than on a printed circuit board.
  [1310]       Similarly, although the switches 4972A and 4972B are shown and described as
 being irreversibly movable from a first state to a second state, in other embodiments, a
 switch can be reversibly movable between a first state and a second state. Moreover, in
 yet other embodiments, a switch can have more than two distinct states.
  [1311]      Although the actuators 4732, 4539 are shown and described as being
 configured to move in a direction substantially parallel to the surface of the substrate 4924,
 in other embodiments, an actuator can be configured to actuate an electronic circuit system
 by moving in any direction. For example, in some embodiments a circuit actuator can be
 moved in a direction substantially normal to a portion of an electronic circuit system.
 [1312]       Similarly, although the actuators 4732, 4539 are shown and described as
 actuating the switches 4972A and 4972B by tearing and/or deforming a portion of the
 substrate 4924, in other embodiments, a switch can be moved from a first state to a second
 state without deforming the substrate. For example, in some embodiments, an electronic
 circuit system can include a printed circuit board having a substrate and a frangible switch
tab disposed on the substrate. An electrical conductor and/or a switch can be disposed on
the frangible switch tab, such that when the switch tab is removed from the substrate the

   WO 2007/126851                                                          PCT/US2007/007626
                                              66
  switch is moved from a first state to a second state. In this manner, the switch can be
  actuated without tearing and/or deforming a portion of the substrate.
  [1313]       Although the actuators 4732, 4539 are shown and described as being included
 on the safety lock 4710 and the base 4520, respectively, in other embodiments, the
 actuators can be included on any component of a medicament delivery device. For
 example, in some embodiments, an auto-injector can include a start button having an
 actuator configured to actuate an electronic circuit system. In other embodiments, an auto
 injector can include a movable member configured to move a medicament container
 and/or a needle within a housing of the auto-injector, the movable member including an
 actuator configured to actuate an electronic circuit system.
 [13141        Although the safety lock 4710 is shown and described as being removed from
 the housing 4110 of the auto-injector 4002 when in its second position, in other
 embodiments, a safety lock can remain coupled to the housing of an auto-injector when in
 its second position. For example, in some embodiments, a safety lock can be moved from
 its first position to its second position by rotating a portion of the safety lock.
 [13151        Certain components of the auto-injector 4002 are shown and described as being
 coupled together via protrusions and mating openings. The protrusions and/or openings
 can be disposed on any of the components to be coupled together and need not be limited
to only a certain component. For example, the safety lock 4710 is shown and described as
including an actuator 4732 having a protrusion 4730 configured to be received within an
opening 4928A defined by the substrate 4924. In some embodiments, however, the
protrusions can be disposed on the substrate 4924 and the mating openings can be defined
by the actuator 4732. In other embodiments, such components can be coupled together in
any suitable way, which need not include protrusions and mating openings. For example,
in some embodiments, an actuator can be operatively coupled to an actuation portion of a
substrate via mating shoulders, clips, adhesive or the like.
11316]        Similarly, although certain components of the auto-injector 4002 are shown
and described as being constructed from multiple separate components, in some
embodiments, such components can be monolithically constructed. For example, the
needle guard 4810 and the battery isolation tab 4860 are shown and described as being

   WO 2007/126851                                                    PCT/US2007/007626
                                              67
  constructed separately and then coupled together. In other embodiments, a needle guard
  and a battery isolation tab can be constructed monolithically.
  [13171      Although the electronic circuit systems are shown and described herein as
  including a proximity sensor, in other embodiments, an electronic circuit system can
  include any suitable sensor for providing feedback to the electronic circuit system. For
 example, in some embodiments, the electronic circuit system can include a pressure sensor
 configured to sense the internal gas pressure within a gas-powered auto-injector. In this
 manner, the electronic circuit system can output an instruction and/or a status message
 when the internal gas pressure crosses a predetermined threshold. For example, in some
 embodiments, when the internal gas pressure rapidly increases, the electronic circuit
 system can output a message, such as, for example, "Internal gas chamber has been
 successfully punctured - injection is in process."
 [13181       Similarly, in some embodiments, the electronic circuit system can include a
 temperature sensor configured to sense the temperature of the medicament contained
 within the medicament delivery device. In this manner, the electronic circuit system can
 output an instruction and/or a status message when the medicament is too cold for
effective delivery. For example, in some embodiments, when the medicament is too cold
for effective delivery (this may occur, for example, if the medicament delivery device has
been left outside overnight), the electronic circuit system can output a message, such as,
for example, "Medicament is too cold - please briskly rub the auto-injector between your
hands."
[13191       Although the batteries 4962 are shown and described as having a first surface
4964 (an electrically negative terminal) and a second surface 4966 (an electrically positive
terminal) opposite the first surface, in other embodiments the batteries can include a first
surface and a second surface that are adjacent each other and/or co-planar. In other
embodiments, an electronic circuit system can be powered by a battery having any shape
and/or any number of surfaces. In yet other embodiments, an electronic circuit system can
be powered by any suitable energy storage device, such as, for example, a capacitor, solar
cell, spring actuated generator, or the like.
[1320]       Although the medicament delivery devices have been shown and described
above as being primarily single-use medical injectors, in some embodiments a

   WO 2007/126851                                                    PCT/US2007/007626
                                           68
 medicament delivery device can include any suitable device for delivering one or more
 doses of a medicament into a patient's body.       For example, in some embodiments, a
 medicament delivery device can be a pen injector containing multiple doses of a chronic
 care medicament, such as, for example, insulin. In such embodiments, an electronic
 circuit system can output instructions associated with not only an initial use of the
 medicament delivery device, but also associated with repeated uses, dosage monitoring or
 the like. In other embodiments, a medicament delivery device can include a transdermal
 medicament delivery device, an inhaler or a nasal medicament delivery device.
  [13211     FIGS. 69 and 70 show an inhaler 6002 according to an embodiment of the
 invention. The inhaler 6002 includes a housing 6110 and a medicament container 6262
 movably disposed within the housing 6110. The medicament container 6262 includes a
 metering mechanism (not shown in FIGS. 69 and 70) configured to discharge a
 predetermined volume of medicament when the inhaler 6002 is actuated.
 [1322]      The housing 6110 has a proximal end portion 6112 and a distal end portion
 6114. An label 6910, which includes at least a portion of an electronic circuit system
 6920, is disposed on an outer surface 6111 of the housing 6110. As described above, a
 portion of the label 6910 can include a textual indicia 6916.     Similar to the electronic
 circuit systems shown and described above, the electronic circuit system 6920 is
 configured to output at least one electronic signal associated with the user of the inhaler
 6002.    The electronic circuit system 6920 includes a microprocessor (not shown), a
microspeaker 6956 and an LED 6958. The electronic circuit system 6920 also includes a
motion sensor 6976, the function of which is discussed in more detail below.
 [1323]      The distal end portion 6114 of the housing 6110 includes a mouthpiece 6212
about which a protective cap 6710 is disposed. Prior to use, the inhaler 6002 is first
enabled by removing the protective cap 6710, as shown by the arrow GG in FIG. 70. The
protective cap 6710 includes an actuator 6732 that actuates the electronic circuit system
6920 to trigger a predetermined output or sequence of outputs when the protective cap
6710 is removed. In some embodiments, the actuator 6732 can include a protrusion that is
received by an actuation portion of the electronic circuit system 6920, in a similar manner
as described above. In other embodiments, the actuator 6732 can be configured to engage
a microswitch that can be repeatedly moved between a first state and a second state.

   WO 2007/126851                                                     PCT/US2007/007626
                                           69
[1324]       When actuated, the electronic circuit system 6920 can output one or more
predetermined electronic outputs.     For example, in some embodiments, the electronic
circuit system 6920 can output an audible message via the microspeaker 6956 instructing
the user to "vigorously shake the inhaler for five seconds."            The processor can
simultaneously enable the motion sensor 6976.
[13251       Upon receiving a predetermined input from the motion sensor 6976, which can
be any sensor suitable for detecting the rapid motion of the inhaler 6002, the processor can
then send an electronic signal to produce a second audible message. Such a message can
state, for example, "the inhaler is now sufficiently shaken and is ready for use." In some
embodiments, the electronic circuit system 6920 can also output an instruction associated
with the correct placement of the inhaler 6002. For example, the electronic circuit system
6920 can output an audible message stating "please place the mouthpiece in your mouth
 and firmly press down on the medicament container." The electronic circuit system 6920
 can also simultaneously output a signal to the LED 6958 to provide a visual indication of
 where the mouthpiece 6212 is located.
 [1326]      After the inhaler 6002 is enabled and placed within the mouth of the patient,
 the inhaler 6002 is actuated by moving the medicament container 6262 distally within
 housing 6110, as illustrated by arrow HH in FIG. 70.           In some embodiments, the
 medicament container 6262 can include an actuator (not shown) that actuates the
 electronic circuit 6920, in a manner similar to those described above, to trigger a
 predetermined output or sequence of outputs.      For example, in some embodiments, the
 processor can output an electronic signal associated with recorded speech to the
 microspeaker 6956.      Such an electronic signal can be, for example, associated with a
 recorded message notifying the user that the injection is complete, instructing the user on
 post-injection procedures, instructing the user on post-injection medical treatment or the
 like. Such a status message can state, for example, "The injection is now complete."
  [13271     In other embodiments, a medicament delivery device can include a transdennal
 medicament delivery device, such as for example, a medicament patch.                In such
 embodiments, an electronic circuit system can be configured, for example, to output
 instructions associated with the enablement, placement and/or removal of the transdermal
 medicament delivery device.     For example, in some embodiments, the electronic circuit

      WO 2007/126851                                                          PCT/US2007/007626
                                              70
     system can be actuated by removing a protective barrier that seals the portion
                                                                                       of the device
    that contacts the skin.
     [13281     Although the medical devices are shown and described
                                                                                   above as being
    medicament delivery devices, such as, for example,
                                                          medical injectors, inhalers or the like,
    in other embodiments, a medical device can include
                                                           a medicament container, such as, for
    example, a pill bottle, a blister pack or the like. In yet
                                                                   other embodiments, a medical
    device can include a container configured -to contain
                                                              one or more medicament delivery
   devices. For example, FIGS. 71 - 73 are schematic
                                                           illustrations of a medical device 100
   according to an embodiment of the invention
                                                          in a first configuration, a second
   configuration and a third configuration, respectively.
                                                             The medical device 100 includes a
   container 110 including an electronic circuit system
                                                            130 and defining an internal region
   112. The internal region 112 is configured to contain
                                                              one or more medicament delivery
   devices. Disposed within the internal region 112
                                                        are at least a first medicament delivery
   device 150 and a second medicament delivery device
                                                            152. The first medicament delivery
   device 150 and/or the second medicament delivery
                                                              device 152 can be any suitable
  medicament delivery device, such as, for example,
                                                           an auto-injector, a pen injector, an
  inhaler or the like.
  [1329]       As shown in FIG. 72, the electronic circuit system 130
                                                                          is configured to output a
  first electronic output OPI when the first medicament
                                                               delivery device 150 is removed
 from the internal region 112 of the container 110,
                                                           as indicated by the arrow A. As
 discussed in more detail herein, the first electronic
                                                        output OPI can be associated with an
 identification of the first medicament delivery device
                                                           150, an identification of a physical
 condition and/or an instruction for using the first
                                                           medicament delivery device 150.
 Moreover, the first electronic output OPI can include
                                                             a visual output, an audible output
 and/or a haptic output. For example, in some embodiments,

 can be associated with an audible message instructing

    [13301      Similarly, as shown in FIG. 73, the electronic circuit system 130 is configured
   to output a second electronic output OP2 when the second medicament delivery device
    152 is removed from the internal region 112 of the container 110, as indicated by the
   arrow B. The second electronic output OP2, which is different than the first electronic
   output OPI, can include a visual output, an audible output and/or a haptic output.
   Moreover, as with the first electronic output OPI, the second electronic output OP2 can be
   associated with at least one of an identification of the second medicament delivery device
   152, an identification of a physical condition and/or an instruction for using the second
  medicament delivery device 152. In this manner, the electronic circuit system 130 can
  provide the user with information about the particular medicament delivery device that has
  been removed from the container 110.
   [1331]       Although the second electronic output OP2 is described as being different than
  the first electronic output OPI, in some embodiments, the second electronic output OP2
  can be the same as the first electronic output OPI. In some embodiments, for example, the
  second electronic output OP2 can include the same information as previously output via
  the first electronic output OPI along with additional information. In this manner, the
  second electronic output OP2 can confirm the instructions and/or information provided by
  the first electronic output OP I.
  [13321       The container 110 can be any container suitable for containing a plurality of
 medicament delivery devices. For example, in some embodiments, the container 110 can
 be a box-like structure that includes a lid or cover that can be repeatedly opened and
 closed to selectively expose the internal region 112 of the container 110 to an area outside
 the container 110. In other embodiments, the container 110 can include a frangible
 portion that can be irreversibly moved to expose the internal region 112 of the container
 110 to allow access to the first medicament delivery device 150 and/or the second
medicament delivery device 152.
 [1333]        The container 110 can be either portable or permanently installed at a particular
location. For example, in some embodiments, the container 110 can be configured to be
moved by the user. For example, in such embodiments, a user may carry the container
110 to events, such as picnics, field trips, children's camps or the like, where the
likelihood of use increases. In other embodiments, the container 110 can be removably
coupled to a mounting area within a building, such as a restaurant, airport and/or shopping

                                                                       situation, the user can locate
      the container 110 and move it to the area in which the
                                                                  emergency situation is occurring.
      In yet other embodiments, the container 110 can be
                                                               permanently coupled to a wall of a
     building.
     [13341      The container 110 can be constructed from any suitable
                                                                               material, such as, for
     example, plastic, metal alloys, insulative foam, fabric
                                                                 or any combination thereof. In
     some embodiments, for example, the container 110
                                                           can include a hard, plastic outer casing
     and an insulative, shock-absorbing inner liner. In
                                                           some embodiments, the container 110
     can be constructed from a waterproof material and/or
                                                              can be configured to float. In some
    embodiments, the container 110 can be constructed
                                                            from a material configured to prevent
    light from reaching the interior region 112 of the container.
                                                                      In this manner, the container
    can prevent the medicaments contained therein from
                                                                 being exposed to light that can
    impact the chemical structure and/or stability of the
                                                           medicament.
    [13351      Although the container 110 is shown and described
                                                                        above as containing a first
    medicament delivery device 150 and a second medicament

   include medicament delivery devices of different
                                                          sizes and/or shapes. For example, in
   some embodiments, a container can be configured
                                                          to include a medical injector having a
   long, narrow shape and an inhaler having a wider shape.
   [13361       FIGS. 74 - 76 are schematic illustrations of a medical
                                                                           device 200 according to
  one such embodiment of the invention in a first configuration,
                                                                       a second configuration and
  a third configuration, respectively. The medical
                                                          device 200 includes a container 210
  including an electronic circuit system 230 and defining
                                                                   an internal region 212. The
  internal region 212 includes a first retainer 214
                                                        and a second retainer 216. The first
 retainer 214 retains a first medicament delivery device
                                                              250 within the internal region 212
 of the container. Similarly, the second retainer 216
                                                          retains a second medicament delivery
 device 252 within the internal region 212 of the container.
 [1337]        The electronic circuit system 230 includes a first
                                                                     switch 236 associated    with
the first retainer 214 and a second switch 237 associated
                                                              with the second retainer 216.    The
first switch 236 is configured move between a first
                                                         state (e.g., closed) and a second    state
(e.g., opened) when the first medicament delivery
                                                         device 250 is removed from the       first

retainer 214.   Similarly, the second switch 237 is configured move between a first state
and a second state when the second medicament delivery device 252 is removed from the
second retainer 216.      In this manner, the electronic circuit system 230 can output
electronic outputs based on the state of the first switch 236 and/or the second switch 237.
11338]      More particularly, as shown in FIG. 75, the electronic circuit system 230 is
configured to output a first electronic output OP3, of the type described above, when the
first medicament delivery device 250 is removed from the first retainer 214, as indicated
by the arrow C.     Similarly, as shown in FIG. 76, the electronic circuit system 230 is
configured to output a second electronic output OP4, of the type described above, when
the second medicament delivery device 252 is removed from the second retainer 216, as
indicated by the arrow D.        Said another way, the electronic circuit system 230 is
configured to output the first electronic output OP3 in response to the first switch 236
moving between its first state and its second state. Similarly, the electronic circuit system
230 is configured to output the second electronic output OP4 in response to the second
switch 237 moving between its first state and its second state.
[1339]       The first retainer 214 can be any structure that cooperates with the first
medicament delivery device 250 to retain the first medicament delivery device 250 within
the internal region 212 of the container 210. Similarly, the second retainer 216 can be any
structure that cooperates with the second medicament delivery device 252 to retain the
second medicament delivery device 252 within the internal region 212 of the container
210. In some embodiments, for example, the first retainer 214 can be a recessed portion
(not shown in FIGS. 74-76) of the internal region 212 having a shape to receive at least a
portion of the first medicament delivery device 250.         Such a recess can include, for
example, an edge, a contour or a ridge that forms an interference fit with a portion of the
first medicament delivery device 250 when the first medicament delivery device 250 is
received within the first retainer 214. In other embodiments, for example, the first retainer
214 and/or the second retainer 216 can be a clip configured to engage a portion of the first
medicament delivery device 250 and/or the second medicament delivery device 252,
respectively, to retain the first medicament delivery device 250 and/or the second
medicament delivery device 252 in the internal region 212. In yet other embodiments, the
first retainer 214 and/or the second retainer 216 can be an elastic member, such as an
elastic band configured to engage a portion of the first medicament delivery device 250
and/or the second medicament delivery device 252. In yet other embodiments, the first

 WO 2007/126851                                                       PCT/US2007/007626
                                            74
retainer 214 and/or the second retainer 216 can include a frangible member, such as a
removable plastic covering configured to retain the first medicament delivery device 250
and/or the second medicament delivery device 252 in the internal region 212.
[13401       In some embodiments, the first retainer 214 can be uniquely associated with the
first medicament delivery device 250 and/or the second retainer 214 can be uniquely
associated with the second medicament delivery device 252.         In this manner, the first
medicament delivery device 250 can only be associated with the first switch 236 and the
second medicament delivery device 252 can only be associated with the second switch
237. Said another way, such an arrangement prevents second medicament delivery 252
from inadvertently being retained by the first retainer 214, which could result in the
electronic circuit system 230 outputting the first electronic output OP3 when the second
medicament delivery device 252 is removed from the container 210 or vice-versa.
Moreover, by using the first retainer 214 and the second retainer 216, the internal region
212 can be adapted to contain a variety of different medicament delivery devices having
different sizes, shapes and/or characteristics. For example, in those embodiments in which
the first retainer 214 is a recessed portion of the internal region 212, the shape of the
recess can be uniquely associated with a shape of the first medicament delivery device
250, thereby preventing the second medicament delivery device 252 from being received
within the first retainer 214. Similarly, in some embodiments, the second retainer 216 can
be a recessed portion of the internal region 212, of the type described above, having a
shape to receive at least a portion of the second medicament delivery device 252.
[13411       Although the retainers are described above as cooperating with the medicament
delivery devices to retain the medicament delivery devices within the internal region 212
of the container 210, in some embodiments, the first retainer 214 and/or the second
retainer 216 can perform additional functions.     For example, in some embodiments, the
first retainer 214 can electronically couple an electronic circuit system (not shown in
FIGS. 74-76) disposed on the first medicament delivery device 250 to the electronic
circuit system 230. The electronic circuit system included in the first medicament delivery
device 250 can be of the type shown and described above with reference FIGS. 46-70.
Similarly, the second retainer 216 can electronically couple an electronic circuit system
(not shown in FIGS. 74-76) disposed on the second medicament delivery device 252 to the
electronic circuit system 230. In this manner, the first retainer 214 and/or the second
retainer 216 can be used as a battery charging port, a data exchange port or the like.

   [13421      FIG. 77 is a schematic illustration of a inedical device 300 according to an
   embodiment of the invention. Because the medical device 300 is similar in many respects
   to the medical devices shown and described above, the medical device 300 is shown in
   only one configuration. The medical device 300 includes a container 310 including an
   electronic circuit system 330 and defining an internal region 312. The internal region 312
  includes a first medicament delivery device 350 and a second medicament delivery device
  352 of the types described above.
   113431     The electronic circuit system 330 is configured to output a first electronic
  output (not shown in FIG. 77), of the type described above, when the first medicament
  delivery device 350 is removed from the internal region 312 of the container 310.
  Similarly the electronic circuit system 330 is configured to output a second electronic
  output (not shown in FIG. 77), of the type described above, when the second medicament
  delivery device 352 is removed from the internal region 312 of the container 310.
  [1344]      Moreover, as shown in FIG. 77, the first medicament delivery device 350
 includes a label 354, such as, for example, a radio frequency identification
                                                                               ("RFID") tag,
 configured to output a signal S that can be received by the electronic circuit system
                                                                                          330.
 In some embodiments, the signal S can indicate the position of the first medicament
 delivery device 350 (e.g., whether the first medicament delivery device 350 is outside
                                                                                            the
 internal region 312).      In other embodiments, the signal S can include information
 characterizing the first medicament delivery device 350.            For example, in some
 embodiments, the signal S can be associated with the contents of the first medicament
 delivery device 350 (e.g., the amount and type of medicament contained therein),
                                                                                             an
 expiration date of the first medicament delivery device 350, a dosage of the

 medicament delivery device 350 and/or a use instruction associated with the
                                                                                          first
 medicament delivery device 350. In this manner, the electronic circuit system 330
                                                                                           can
receive the signal S and produce the first electronic output (not shown in FIG.
                                                                                       77) to
include information contained within the signal S. Said another way, this arrangement
allows the electronic circuit system 330 to produce an electronic output that is unique

the medicament delivery devices contained within the container 310.

  example, in some embodiments, the memory device 434 can include d read only memory
  (ROM) component and a random access memory (RAM) component. The memory device
  432 can also include other types of memory suitable for storing data in a form retrievable
  by the processor 432, for example, electronically-programmable read only memory
  (EPROM), erasable electronically-programmable read only memory (EEPROM) and/or
  flash memory.
  [13561      Although the medical devices shown and described herein include one
  electronic circuit system, in some embodiments, a medical device can include multiple
  electronic circuit systems configured to perform the functions described herein.
  [1357]      Although    the containers shown and described        above include multiple
 medicament delivery devices, in some embodiments, a container can include only one
 medicament delivery device. For example, FIGS. 79 - 81 show a medical device 500
 including a container 510 that contains a medicament delivery device 550, such as, for
 example a pen injector or an auto-injector. As described above, the container 510 defines
 an internal region 512 in which the medicament delivery device 550 is contained. The
 container includes an electronic circuit system 530 configured to produce one or more
 electronic outputs of the type described above. More particularly, the electronic circuit
 system 530 includes a speaker 544 and an LCD screen 542.
 [13581      The container 510 also includes a movable portion 518, such as, for example, a
 hinged lid, that has a first position (see FIG. 79) and a second position (see FIGS. 80
 81).   When the movable portion 518 is in the first position, the movable portion 518
 covers the internal region 512 of the container 510. Conversely, when the movable
portion 518 is in the second position, at least a portion of the internal region 512 of the
container 510 is exposed. Said another way, when the movable portion 518 is in the
second position, the medicament delivery device 550 can be removed from the internal
region 512 of the container 510.
[1359]       The electronic circuit system 530 is operatively coupled to a first switch 536
and a second switch 537. The first switch 536 is configured to move between a first state
(e.g., closed) and a second state (e.g., opened) when the movable portion 518 moves
between its first position and its second position, as indicated by arrow E in FIG. 80. The

    embodiments the movable member 518 can be a frangible cover that provides a
   tamperproof seal, a sanitary seal, or the like.
    [1362]      Although the containers are shown and described above as being rigid, box-like
   containers, in other embodiments, a container can have any suitable shape and/or
   flexibility. For example, in some embodiments, a container can be a flexible, pouch-like
   container. Such a container can be more easily carried in certain circumstances, such as,
   for example at outdoor events (e.g., children's camps, concerts, picnics or the like). In
   other embodiments, a container can be a tube configured to contain all or a portion of a
  medicament delivery device. For example, FIGS. 82 - 84 show a medical device 600
   including a tube-shaped container 610 and a retainer 618. The container 610 defines an
  internal region 612 (see FIG. 84) in which at least a portion of a medicament delivery
  device 650 can be contained.
   [1363]       The retainer 618, which can be, for example, a mating tube-shaped lid, is
  movably coupled to the container 610 to retain the medicament delivery device 650 within
  the internal region 612. Said another way, the retainer 618 has a first position (FIG. 82)
  and a second position (FIG. 58). When the retainer 618 is in the first position, the retainer
  618 prevents the medicament delivery device 650 from being removed from the internal
 region 612 of the container 610. When the retainer 618 is in the second position, the
 medicament delivery device 650 can be removed from the internal region 612 of the
 container 610.
 [1364]        The medical device 600 includes an electronic circuit system 630 coupled to
 the container 610. The electronic circuit system 630 includes a speaker 644 and a light
 emitting diode (LED) 642 for providing an electronic output associated with the use of the
medicament delivery device 650, as described herein. In some embodiments, the
electronic circuit system can be, for example, a flexible circuit included in a label coupled
to anouter surface of the container 610, similar to the electronic circuit systems described
above with reference to FIGS. 46 - 70.
[13651         The electronic circuit system 630 is configured to output a first electronic
output via the LED 642 and/or the speaker 644 when the retainer 618 is moved relative to
the container 610, as indicated by arrows G and/or G' in FIG. 83. As described above, the
first electronic output can be associated with an identification of the medicament delivery

device 650, an identification of a physical condition and/or an instruction for using the
medicament delivery device 650. For example, in some embodiments, the first electronic
output can be associated with an audible message instructing a user in the use of the
medicament delivery device 650. Such an audible message can state, for example, "You
have activated an interactive auto-injector containing DOSE mg of Epinephrine. Please
remove the top of the container by twisting and pulling as indicated by the flashing arrow.
After removing the top of the container, please remove the auto-injector from the
container by firmly pulling on the exposed end of the auto-injector."
[13661       The electronic circuit system 630 can be prompted to output the first electronic
output by a switch 636 configured to change states when the retainer 618 is moved relative
to the container 610. The switch 636 can be any suitable electronic switch having at least
two states. For example, in some embodiments, the switch 636 can be a single-use "tear
through" switch, as described above with reference to FIGS. 46 - 70.                In other
embodiments, a switch can be a multi-use switch, such as a microswitch.
[1367]       Similarly, the electronic circuit system 630 is configured to output a second
electronic output via the LED 642 and/or the speaker 644 when the medicament delivery
device 650 is removed from the internal region 612 defined by the container 610, as
shown by arrow H in FIG. 84. The second electronic output can be associated with an
identification of the medicament delivery device 650, an identification of a physical
condition and/or an instruction for using the medicament delivery device 650.             For
example, in some embodiments, the second electronic output can be an audible message
stating, "To activate the auto-injector, first remove the needle guard. The needle guard is
at the bottom of the auto-injector and contains the number one inside of an arrow pointing
downward. Remove the needle guard by pulling in the direction of the arrow."
[13681       As shown in FIG. 84, the medicament delivery device 650 includes a label 654
containing information associated with the medicament delivery device 650 arranged in a
machine-readable format. The electronic circuit system 630 is configured to receive (e.g.,
"read") the information contained in the label 654 and include at least a portion of the
information in the first electronic output and/or the second electronic output.        In this
manner, the electronic circuit system 630 can be configured to produce an electronic
output that is unique to the medicament delivery device 650 contained within the container
610. This arrangement allows the container 610 to be reused with any number of different

                                          83
medicament delivery devices 650. Moreover, this arrangement allows the container 610 to
track the usage of a chronic-care medicament delivery devices.       For example, in some
embodiments, the electronic circuit system 630 can track each use of the medicament
delivery device 650 and log such information on the label 654.
[1369]      The label 654 can be any device suitable for containing information associated
with the medicament delivery device 650 in a machine-readable format. For example, in
some embodiments, the label 654 can include a bar code portion containing information
associated with the medicament delivery device 650. In other embodiments, the label 654
can include a magnetic strip containing information associated with the medicament
delivery device 650.   In yet other embodiments, the label 654 can include a passive RFID
tag containing information associated with the medicament delivery device 650. In yet
other embodiments, the label 654 can include an active RFID tag containing information
associated with the medicament delivery device 650.
 [13701     Although the retainer 618 is shown as covering the internal region 612 defined
by the container 610, in some embodiments, the retainer 618 can allow access to the
internal region 612 while still retaining the medicament delivery device 650 within the
internal region 612. For example, in some embodiments, the retainer 618 can be a clip, a
strap or the like.
 [13711     Although the medicament delivery device 650 is shown in FIGS. 82 - 83 as
being disposed entirely within the container 610 and the retainer 618, in some
embodiments, only a portion of the medicament delivery device 650 is disposed within the
container 610 and/or the retainer 618. For example, in some embodiments, a container can
be a sleeve configured to be disposed about a portion of a medicament delivery device,
such as a chronic care pen injector. The retainer can function to retain the pen injector
within the sleeve and/or to prevent the pen injector from being actuated (e.g., the retainer
can act as a locking member). In use, the user can activate the electronic circuit system by
depressing a start button disposed on the container. Alternatively, in some embodiments,
the electronic circuit system can be activated by removing the retainer from the pen
injector and/or the container. In yet other embodiments, the electronic circuit system can
be activated by moving the pen injector relative to the container (i.e., twisting the pen
injector within the container). Upon activation, the electronic circuit system then "reads"

more components of the simulated medicament delivery device 102.
[1375]      In some embodiments, the user can activate the electronic circuit system 170
by pushing the start button 171, which prompts the electronic circuit system 170 to output
at least the electronic output OP10. In some embodiments, for example, when the start
button 171 is actuated, the electronic circuit system 170 can output a predetermined
sequence of electronic outputs. As described above, in some embodiments, the start
button 171 can activate the electronic circuit system 170 by providing an input to a
processor (not shown in FIG. 85). In other embodiments, the start button 171 can activate
the electronic circuit system 170 by placing a battery (not shown in FIG. 85) in electronic
communication with a portion of the electronic circuit system 170.
 [13761      The simulated medicament delivery device 102 can simulate the actual
medicament delivery device in any number of ways. For example, in some embodiments,
 the simulated medicament delivery device 102 can have a shape corresponding to a shape
 of the actual medicament delivery device, a size corresponding to a size of the actual
 medicament delivery device and/or a weight corresponding to a weight of the actual
 medicament delivery device. Moreover, in some embodiments, the simulated medicament
 delivery device 102 can include components that correspond to the components of the
 actual medicament delivery device. In this manner, the simulated medicament delivery
 device 102 can simulate the look, feel and sounds of the actual medicament delivery
 device. For example, in some embodiments, the simulated medicament delivery device
  102 can include external components (e.g., a housing, a needle guard, a sterile cover, a
 safety lock or the like) that correspond to external components of the actual medicament
 delivery device.    In some embodiments, the simulated medicament delivery device 102
  can include internal components (e.g., an actuation mechanism, a spring, a compressed gas
  source, a medicament container or the like) that correspond to internal components of the
  actual medicament delivery device.
  [13771     In some embodiments, however, the simulated medicament delivery device 102
  can be devoid of a medicament and/or those components that cause the medicament to be
  delivered (e.g., a needle, a nozzle or the like). In this manner, the simulated medicament
  delivery device 102 can be used to train a user in the use of the actual medicament

   medicament delivery devices.        For example, in some embodiments, the simulated
   medicament delivery device 102 can simulate
                                                   a medical injector, such as an auto-injector,

    [13841      To activate the electronic circuit system 270, the user first pushes the start
    button 271. As described above, when actuated, the electronic circuit
                                                                                   system 270 can
    output one or more electronic outputs. For example, in some embodiments, an electronic
   output can be associated with an audio and/or a visual output used to describe
                                                                                         the features

   example, in some embodiments, the first LED 272A, the output of which is shaped
                                                                                               as the
   numeral "1," can output a flashing light of a first color while the

                                                                                      can output a
  flashing light of a second color different than the first color while the
                                                                                       speaker 274
  simultaneously outputs a recorded voice message stating "the simulated
                                                                                     safety lock is

  manner, the electronic circuit system 270 can provide both audible and visual
                                                                                        instructions

  113851       In some embodiments, the electronic circuit system 270 can output at least
                                                                                                 one

  first state and a second state. For example, similar to the needle guard
                                                                                   assembly 4810
  shown and described above with reference to FIG. 57, the simulated
                                                                                     needle guard
  assembly 286 can include an actuator configured to actuate a switch contained
                                                                                          within the
 electronic circuit system 270. The switch can be any suitable switch of the
                                                                                      types shown
 and described above. For example, in some embodiments, a switch can
                                                                                       be a "tear
 through" switch configured to move irreversibly from a first state to a
                                                                                 second state. In
 other embodiments, a switch can be a microswitch configured to repeatedly
                                                                                    move between
 a first state and a second state. In this manner, the electronic circuit system
                                                                                   270 can output
 instructions when the user moves the simulated needle guard assembly 286
                                                                                    relative to the
housing 285. Such instructions can state, for example, "You have

lock as indicated by the flashing arrow." In a similar manner, the simulated

can be electronically coupled together by any suitable
                                                          mechanism, such as, for example a

[13901      As described above, to activate the electronic circuit system 370, the user
pushes the start button 371.   When actuated, the electronic circuit system 370 can output
one or more electronic outputs. For example, in some embodiments, the first visual output
device 372A can output a flashing light while the speaker 374 simultaneously outputs a
recorded voice message stating "Please remove the simulated needle guard, which is at the
end of the injector as indicated by the flashing light."
[1391]       As illustrated by arrow KK in FIG. 88, the simulated needle guard 386 is
removed by moving it along the longitudinal axis of the housing 385. When the simulated
needle guard 386 is removed, the portion of the electronic circuit system 370 that includes
the first visual output device 372A is no longer electronically coupled to the remainder of
the electronic circuit system 370.       Accordingly, the first visual output device 372A
becomes deactivated when the simulated needle guard 386 is removed.           Moreover, the
terminals 375 of the electronic conductors 379 can form a portion of a switch, such that
when the simulated needle guard 386 is removed, the switch changes from a first state to a
 second state, thereby prompting the electronic circuit system 370 to output an additional
 electronic output.   For example, in some embodiments, the speaker 374 can output a
recorded voice message stating "Please place the simulated auto-injector against your
 thigh. Do not tilt the simulated auto-injector. When in the proper position, please press
 firmly against the thigh before actuating the auto-injector."
 [13921      In addition to prompting the electronic circuit system 370 to output additional
 visual and/or audible outputs, the removal of the simulated needle guard 386 can also
 activate the position sensor (not shown in FIGS. 87 - 91). The position sensor can be any
 suitable sensor for sensing a position, location and/or orientation of the simulated auto
 injector 302. For example, in some embodiments, the position sensor can be configured to
 sense the angle 0 between the longitudinal axis of the housing 385 and the surface of the
 target T (see FIG. 89). In other embodiments, the position sensor can be configured to
 sense the absolute angle of the longitudinal axis of the housing based on gravity. In yet
 other embodiments, the position sensor can be capacitance sensor, a temperature sensor,
 an optical sensor or any other suitable sensor for determining when the distal end 393 of
 the simulated medicament delivery device 302 is in contact with the target T.        In this
 manner, the position sensor can provide feedback to the user to ensure that the simulated
 medicament delivery device 302 is correctly positioned relative to the target T.

    the force and/or pressure between the target T and the
                                                                simulated safety lock 387. In this
    manner, the force sensor 377 can provide feedback

  of the types shown and described above with reference to FIGS. 48 and 78. The memory
  device 473 can be configured to store processor-readable code 405 instructing the
  processor 478 to perform the functions described herein. In some embodiments, the
  processor-readable code 405 can be modified and/or updated as circumstances dictate.
  [1400]      The electronic circuit system 470 includes an input/output device 477
  configured to receive electronic inputs from a switch 475 and/or a sensor 476, as described
  above. In some embodiments, the input/output device 477 can receive inputs from any
  suitable device, such as an RFID tag (as described above), the user's voice (e.g., through a
 microphone), a start button 471 or the like. The input/output device 477 is also configured
 to output electronic signals to various output devices, such as, for example, a visual output
 device 472, an audio output device 474, a haptic output device 494, an olfactory output
 device 495, a taste output device 496, a wireless receiver (e.g., an RFID tag, a cellular
 phone system or the like) and/or a wired receiver (e.g., a wired network):
 [14011      The visual output device 472 can be any suitable device for producing visual
 indicia, such as, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), liquid-crystal display (LCD)
                                                                                       screens,
 optical polymers, fiber optic components or the like. In this manner, the electronic circuit
 system 470 can simulate a particular visual feature of a medicament delivery device, such
 as, for example, a change in the color of a status window.
 [1402]      Similarly, the audio output device 474 can be any suitable device for producing
sound, such as a micro-speaker, a piezo-electric transducer or the like. Such audible
output can include, for example, an alarm, a series of beeps, recorded speech or the like.
In this manner, the electronic circuit system 470 can simulate a particular audible feature
of a medicament delivery device, such as, for example, a series of clicks associated with
the actuation of the medicament delivery device and/or the delivery of the medicament.
11403]       The haptic output device 494 can be any suitable device for producing a haptic
output, such as a vibrator, a piezo-electric device, a heater, a cooler or the like. In this
manner, the electronic circuit system 470 can simulate a particular feel of a medicament
delivery device.    For example, in some embodiments, a simulated medicament delivery
device can be configured to simulate a transdermal medicament delivery device by
simulating the thermal feel of a medicament delivery area against the skin. In other

                                                                                     for producing a
    scent output. In this manner, the electronic circuit system
                                                                    470 can simulate a particular
    smell associated with a medicament delivery device.
                                                             For example, in some embodiments,
    a simulated medicament delivery device can be configured
                                                                        to simulate an inhaler by
    simulating the smell of a medicament as it is being delivered orally.
    [1405]       Similarly, the taste output device 495 can be any suitable device
                                                                                       for producing
    a simulated taste. In this manner, the electronic circuit

   particular taste associated with a medicament delivery device.

   embodiments, a simulated medicament delivery device can

   inhaler by simulating the taste of a medicament as it is being
                                                                    delivered orally.
   [1406]       In some embodiments, the electronic circuit system 470 can
                                                                                  include a network

 an embodiment of the invention. The medical device 501

     electronic circuit system 570A can receive (e.g.,
                                                            "read") the information contained in the
     label 506 and include at least a portion of the
                                                        information in the electronic output OP 11.
     In this manner, as described above, the first
                                                            electronic circuit system 570A can be

    device -504 contained within the container 503.
                                                            For example, in some embodiments, the
    electronic output OPI 1 can notify a user when

    medicament delivery device 502.
    11409]      Similarly, the second electronic circuit system
                                                                       570B can output an electronic
   output OP12, of the type described above, when
                                                         a user presses a start button (not shown in
   FIG. 93), when the simulated medicament
                                                     delivery device 502 is removed from the
   container 503 or the like. Moreover, similar
                                                     to the function of the first electronic circuit
   system 570A, the second electronic circuit system
                                                            570B can also receive (e.g., "read") the
   information contained in the label 506 and include
                                                             at least a portion of the information in
  the electronic output OP12. For example,
                                                   in some embodiments, the electronic output
  OPl 1 can notify a user of a status (e.g., the
                                                      dosage, expiration date or the like) of the
  medicament delivery device 504.
  114101       In some embodiments, the second electronic circuit
                                                                           system 570B can output a
  signal S12 that can be received by the first
                                                      electronic circuit system 570A. In some
 embodiments, the signal S12 can indicate that
                                                      the simulated medicament delivery device
 502 has been removed from the container 503.
                                                       In other embodiments, the signal S12 can
 include information associated with the use of
                                                      the simulated medicament delivery device
 502 and/or the medicament delivery device 504.
                                                         For example, in some embodiments, the
 signal S12 can be associated with an identification
                                                            of the simulated medicament delivery
device 502, an identification of certain components
                                                             of the simulated medicament delivery
device 502 and/or a status of the simulated medicament
                                                                  delivery device 502, as described
above. In this manner, the first electronic circuit
                                                        system 570A can receive the signal S12
and produce the electronic output OPl 1 to include
                                                          information contained within the signal
S12. Said another way, this arrangement allows
                                                        the first electronic circuit system 570A
and the second electronic circuit system 570B
                                                  to cooperatively output the electronic output

 WO 2007/126851                                                       PCT/US2007/007626

OP 11. For example, in some embodiments, the simulated medicament delivery device 502
can output a signal S12 that prompts the first electronic circuit system 570A to augment
the electronic output OP 12 (e.g., by displaying an output on a larger LCD screen or the
like) previously output by the simulated medicament delivery device 502.
[14111      Similarly, in some embodiments, the first electronic circuit system 570A can
output a signal S1 I that can be received by the second electronic circuit system 570B. In
some embodiments, the signal S1I can include, for example, updated use instructions that
have been received by the first electronic circuit system 570A (e.g., via a wireless
network). As described above, the second electronic circuit system 570B can receive the
signal S11 and produce the electronic output OP12 to include information contained
within the signal S11.    This arrangement allows the first electronic circuit system 570A
and the second electronic circuit system 570B to cooperatively to produce the electronic
output OP12.
[14121       Although the first electronic circuit system 570A and the second electronic
circuit system 570B are each shown and described as being configured to output at least an
electronic output (e.g., OP11 and OP12, respectively) and a signal (e.g., S11 and S12,
respectively), the use of separate terms is made for clarity.      Accordingly, there is no
distinction between signals and electronic outputs.
[14131      Although the medicament delivery device 504 is shown and described as
including a label 506 containing information associated with the medicament delivery
device 504 in a machine-readable format, in some embodiments, the medicament delivery
device can include its own electronic circuit system. In such embodiments, the electronic
circuit system of the medicament delivery device can cooperate with the first electronic
circuit system 570A and/or the second electronic circuit system 570B to produce various
electronic outputs, as described above.
[1414]       In some embodiments the medical device 501 can include a simulated target
(not shown in FIG. 93) to simulate a portion of a body for use with the simulated
medicament delivery device 502.       In some embodiments, the simulated target can be a
skin pad that simulates a portion of a thigh or an arm.         In other embodiments, the
simulated target can be a strap or band that is placed around a portion of the user's body to
provide a target for use with the simulated medicament delivery device 502 and/or the

   own electronic circuit system. In such embodiments, for example, the simulated target
                                                                                                  can
   include one or more LEDs to provide a visual indication of a location for

   medicament, a force sensor to sense the force and/or pressure between the simulated

   and the simulated medicament delivery device 502, or the like.

   electronic circuit system and/or securing an electronic circuit system to an outer

output a sequence of electronic outputs in response to such an input.
 embodiments, for example, when a medicament delivery device is removed from a
 container, an electronic circuit system disposed on the medicament delivery device and/or
 container can output a predetermined sequence of use instructions over a predetermined
 time period.     For example, upon removing the medicament delivery device, the first
 instruction can be an audible output indicating the type of medicament delivery device
 removed. After a predetermined time period, the electronic circuit system can then output
  a second instruction, which can be a visual output instructing the user in how to diagnose
  the patient and/or prepare the patient for the medicament. In a similar manner, the
  electronic circuit system can provide additional outputs to instruct the user in the use of
  the medicament delivery device. Moreover, in some embodiments, the electronic circuit
                                                                                             as

  for example, the disposal of the medicament delivery device, instructions for follow-up
  treatment or the like.

   114191      Although the electronic circuit systems are shown and described above
   outputting recorded speech in English, in other embodiments, the electronic circuit system
   can output recorded speech in any language. In yet other embodiments, the electronic

   114201      For example, although electronic circuit systems are shown and
   above as outputting one or more outputs directed towards a single, immediate user, in
   some embodiments, an electronic circuit system can output multiple outputs directed
   towards multiple different classes of users. For example, in some embodiments, an
   electronic circuit system can output a first electronic output to the immediate user and
   second electronic output to a remotely located emergency response team. In such

  embodiments, the second electronic output can be, for example, a phone call, a page, an e
  mail or the like. For example, in some embodiments, the second electronic output can be
  an e-mail to the parents and/or caregivers of a child. Moreover, such a second electronic
  output can be transmitted either wirelessly or through a wired network.
  [14211      Although the electronic circuit systems are shown and described above as
 outputting one or more outputs in response to one or more switches, in other embodiments
 an electronic circuit system_ can output an electronic output in response to any number of
 different inputs. For example, in some embodiments, an electronic circuit system can
 output an electronic output based on input from the user provided via a keyboard, a touch
 screen, a microphone or any other suitable input device. In this manner, the electronic
 outputs can be produced in response to direct feedback from the user.

   11/562,061, entitled "Devices, Systems and Methods for Medicament Delivery," filed
  November 21, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some
  embodiments, a safety mechanism 10710 can be modified to eliminate the sliding selectors
  from being prematurely pushed upwards.
  [1433]       FIG. 97 depicts an apparatus and method for injecting lyophilized medications,
  and/or powdered biologics that could need to be reconstituted pre-injection. FIG. 97
  shows an auto-injector 11002 including a mechanism to mix and/or create an injectable
  medicament from two or more separate aforementioned substances. The auto-injector
  11002 includes multiple vials 11262 that could have two substances in each vial 11262
  separated by a pierceable membrane 11274 and/or other frangible piece. The vials 11262
 in this embodiment can have one wet substance (such as sterilized water) and one dry
 substance (such as glucagon powder).
  [14341      The user can take off the safety tab 11710 which can prevent the user from
 accidental injection and/or pre-mature activation of the device. Once the safety tab 11710
 is removed, the user can twist and/or rotate the twisting portion 11162 at the top of the
 housing 11110. By rotating this top portion 11162, the rods 11380 attached to this portion
 (which can be threaded rods) can move downward. The rods 11380 can be located in the
 vials 11262 and/or through the pusher bar 11312.        The rods 11380 can have a sharp
 piercing portion on the distal end which can aid in puncturing the aforementioned
 pierceable membrane 11274 that can separate the substances in the vial 11262. Once the
 piercing rod 11380 punctures the frangible seal and/or pierceable membrane 11274, the
 substances can mix together to form one medicament. The user can also shake the entire
housing 11110 in order to aid in this mixing process. Accordingly, this embodiment can
comprise a compact auto-injector 11002 that can have the ability to mix two or more
medicaments in either a liquid or powder form to create one injectable medicament. The
device also can comprise a needle protection system 11840.
[1435]       An exemplary delivery system can comprise a housing, plurality of vials, a
plunger for each vial, a mixing activation mechanism, an activation chamber or vial, single
needle or needle cannula, and/or a medicament or medicaments stored within each vial.
Pre-injection, two or more medicaments can be stored separately in a vial and/or storage
compartment and can communicate with each other once the mixing activation mechanism
is initialized. The mixing activation mechanism could comprise a button, trigger, threaded

    compartment to mix with each other. This communication
                                                                      may occur by shaking the
   device and/or may occur automatically with the mixing

  syringe, a medical injector, an auto-injector or the like.
                                                                     The medical device 12002
  includes a housing 12110 that contains a medicament container
                                                                         12262. The medicament
  container 12262 has a proximal end portion 12264 and a
                                                                distal end portion 12266. The
 medicament container 12262 includes a first plunger 12284
                                                                 and a second plunger 12282.
 [14371        As shown in FIG. 98, when the medical device 12002
                                                                                   is in the first
 configuration, the first plunger 12284 is disposed in a first
                                                                position within the medicament
 container 12262. The second plunger 12282 is disposed in
                                                                   a second position within the
 medicament container 12262. The second position is spaced
                                                                    apart from the first position
 by a first distance D1. In this manner, a first medicament
                                                              containing portion 12283 having
 a volume VI is defined between the first plunger 12284
                                                               and the second plunger 12282.
 Similarly, a second medicament containing portion 12285
                                                                having a volume V2 is defined
between the second plunger 12282 and the distal end portion
                                                                      12266 of the medicament
container 12262. In some embodiments, the medicament
                                                                    container 12262 can be a
cartridge, a vial, an ampule, or the like that is filled with

example, in some embodiments, the first medicament
                                                               containing portion 12283 can
include a liquid medicament 12268, such as a water,

powder. Similarly, in some embodiments, the first medicament
                                                                       containing portion 12283

   WO 2007/126851                                                      PCT/US2007/007626
                                             105
can include a liquid medicament 12268 that is devoid of a gas (e.g., stored in a vacuum)
and/or the second medicament containing portion 12285 can include a solid medicament
12269 that is devoid of a gas (e.g., stored in a vacuum).
114381       As shown in FIG. 99, when the medical device 12002 is in the second
configuration, the first plunger 12284 remains disposed in the first position within the
medicament container 12262. The second plunger 12282 is disposed in a third position
within the medicament container 12262. The third position -is spaced apart from the first
position by a second distance D2 that is less than the first distance D1. Said another way,
when the medical device 12002 is in the second configuration, the volume V2' of the
second medicament containing portion 12285 is greater than the volume V2 when the
medicament container 12262 is in the first configuration. Similarly, because the first
plunger 12284 remains disposed in the first position, the total volume of the medicament
 container 12262 when the medical device 12002 is in the first configuration (VI + V2) is
 the same as the total volume of the medicament container 12262 when the medical device
 12002 is in the second configuration (V1' + V2'). Said another way, the area between the
 first plunger 12284 and the distal end portion 12266 defines a constant volume when the
 second plunger 12282 moves from its first position to its second position
 114391       In some embodiments, when the medical device 12002 is moved from the first
 configuration to the second configuration, as indicated by the arrow AA in FIG. 99, a
 portion of the first medicament 12268 contained in the first medicament containing
 portion 12283 can be conveyed to the second medicament containing portion 12285, as
  indicated by the arrow BB in FIG. 99. Said another way, when the second plunger 12282
 moves towards the proximal end 12264 of the medicament container 12262, a portion of
  the contents of the first medicament containing portion 12283 can be conveyed to the
  second medicament containing portion 12285. In this manner, the medical device 12002
  can combine and/or mix the first medicament 12268 with the second medicament 12269
  contained in the second medicament containing portion 12285 to produce a mixture
  suitable for delivery via the medical device 12002.
  [14401       In some embodiments, the first medicament containing portion 12283 can be
  fluidically isolated from the second medicament containing portion 12285 when the
  medical device 12002 is in the first configuration. The first medicament containing
  portion 12283 can be in fluid communication with the second medicament containing

 WO 2007/126851                                                        PCT/US2007/007626

portion 12285 when the medical device 12002 is moving from the first configuration to
the second configuration. In some embodiments, for example, the second plunger 12282
can form a fluid-tight seal within the medicament container 12262 when the medicament
container 12262 is in the first configuration.      The second plunger 12282 and/or the
medicament container 12262 can further be configured to allow fluid communication
between the first medicament containing portion 12283 and the second medicament
containing portion 12285 when the second plunger 12282 is moving from its first position
to its second position. In this manner, the medical device 12002 can be configured to store
the first medicament 12268 (e.g., a liquid medicament) separately from the second
medicament 12269 (e.g., a lyophilized powder) until such time as the first medicament
 12268 and the second medicament 12269 are combined and/or mixed in preparation for
delivery into the body.
[14411      As shown in FIG. 100, when the medical device 12002 is in the third
configuration, the first plunger 12284 remains disposed in the first position within the
medicament container 12262. The second plunger 12282 is disposed in a fourth position
within the medicament container 12262. The fourth position is spaced apart from the first
position by a third distance D3 that is less than the second distance D2. Moreover, when
the second plunger 12282 is in the fourth position, a portion of the second plunger 12282
is in contact with a portion of the first plunger 12284. In some embodiments, when the
second plunger 12282 is in the fourth position, it engages the first plunger 12284 such that
there is no space between the first plunger 12284 and the second plunger 12282 (i.e., D3 is
zero). Said another way, when the medical device 12002 is in the third configuration, the
volume V1"     of the first medicament containing portion 12283 is substantially zero.
Moreover, the volume V2"         of the second medicament containing portion 12285 is
substantially equal to the total volume of the medicament container          12262 when the
medical device 12002 is in the first configuration (V1 + V2). In this manner, when the
medical device 12002 is in the third configuration, substantially all of the first medicament
12268 and substantially all of the second medicament 12269 are contained within the
second medicament containing portion 12285.          The first medicament 12268 and the
second medicament 12269 can be contained within the second medicament containing
portion 12285 in any suitable form.       For example, in some embodiments, when the
medical device 12002 is in the third configuration, the first medicament 12268 and the

     container 12262. The second plunger 12282 is disposed in
                                                                         a sixth position within the
    medicament container 12262, such that a portion of the second

[1444]      FIGS. 102 - 104 depict an apparatus for injecting lyophilized medications,
and/or powdered biologics that could need to be reconstituted pre-injection. FIGS. 102
 104 show an auto-injector 13002 to mix and/or create an injectable medicament from two
or more separate aforementioned substances. FIGS. 105 - 107 depict a single vial 13262
that could have two substances in the vial 13262 separated by a plunger 13282 and/or
other frangible piece that may be located in the auto-injector 13002 shown in FIGS. 102
 104. The vial 13262 in this embodiment can contain one wet substance (such as sterilized
water) and one dry substance (such as glucagon powder).
[1445]      To mix the substances, the user can push a button or trigger 13468 at the side
of the housing 13110 to initiate the reconstitution and mixing of the two substances. By
pushing this button or trigger 13468 , a spring 13436 can be activated and forced toward
the proximal end 13112 of the housing 13110. This spring 13436 can be attached to a
solid member 13362 which can be attached to a member 13380 connected to the plunger
 13282 or membrane in the vial 13262. As the spring 13436 is forced upward, the solid
member 13362 and therefore plunger/membrane 13282 can be forced upward toward the
proximal end 13264 of the vial 13262. This force can cause the wet substance to bypass
the plunger/membrane 13282, moving down toward the distal end 13266 of the vial 13262
and can thereby cause the wet substance to mix with the dry substance forming the new
injectable medicament. The user can shake the entire housing 13110 in order to aid in this
mixing process. The user can then take off the safety tab 13710 located at the base of the
auto-injector 13002 and operate the auto-injector 13002.
[14461      Some embodiments can include a method for reconstitution with an auto
injector.  Some embodiments can comprise a compact auto-injector that can have the
ability to mix two or more medicaments in either a liquid or powder form to create one
injectable medicament. Some embodiments can use a secondary activation mechanism in
order to effectively mix the two substances to form one injectable medicament.         The
device can comprise a needle protection system.
[1447]      An exemplary delivery system can comprise a housing, vial or plurality of
vials, plunger for each vial, a mixing activation mechanism, an activation chamber or vial,
single needle or needle cannula, and/or a medicament or medicaments stored within each
vial.  Pre-injection, two or more medicaments can be stored separately in a vial and/or

storage compartment and can communicate with each other once the mixing activation
mechanism is initialized.
[14481      The mixing activation mechanism could comprise a button, trigger, plunger,
spring and or some other member or combination of members that, once activated, can
cause the two or more medicaments to interact with each other to form one injectable
medicament.
[14491       The mixing mechanism can comprise a membrane, piece, plunger and/or
portion that can be manipulated pre-injection by the user using the aforementioned mixing
activation mechanism in order to allow the separate substances to fluidly communicate
with each other.     For instance, the mixing activation mechanism can activate a spring
 attached to solid member that is attached to a plunger in one vial. This plunger can be
 separating two substances (one wet and one dry) within one vial by being placed in
 between the two substances. The activated spring can push the solid member and plunger
 upwards toward the proximal end of the aforementioned vial, which can force the wet part
 past the plunger to interact with the dry part, forming the newly mixed injectable
 medicament.
                                                                                              or
 114501      The delivery system can further encompass the mixed medicament vial
 plurality of mixed medicament vials in fluid communication with a reservoir that can
 contain a single needle or needle cannula at the distal end. The needle can be protected by
 some sheath/ shield.
  [14511      The housing can further comprise a passage that is in fluid communication with
                                                                                               or
 the proximal end of the plunger such that when the spring(s) is activated from the distal
  proximal end, a force can be applied through the passage on the plunger at the proximal
  end allowing for the plunger(s), vial(s), reservoir, and/or needle to travel towards the distal
  end of the housing. The force provided can be caused by a spring, bar, contents from a gas
  cylinder, and/or other force mechanism. The plunger can slideably travel through the vial
  towards the distal end to allow for the appropriate dose of medicament to be delivered.
                                                                                          and/or
  Upon exit of the desired contents of the vial, the entire needle, reservoir, vial,
  plunger assembly can retract towards the proximal end of housing by some means such as
  a wire, spring, o-ring, and/or rubber membrane and/or a needle protection portion slides
  over the needle following delivery of the medicament.

  medicament contained therein.
  [14531      To inject a medicament into the body, the safety cover 14452 is moved towards
  the proximal end portion 14112 of the housing 14110 to uncover the mixing
                                                                                      actuator

  14468 is received within the mixing spring opening 14191 defined by the housing 14110,
  as shown in FIG. 111. The mixing actuator button 14468 defines two openings 14474 that
  receive the rod 14478, as shown in FIG. 111. In this manner, when the mixing actuator
  button 14468 is moved inwardly as shown by arrow BBB in FIG. 128, the retaining rod
   14478 moves with the mixing actuator button 14468. Accordingly, as described in more

    [14611     As shown in FIG. 114, the proximal cover 14162 includes a top portion 14171
   and the slide track 14180. As previously described, an outer surface 14184 of the slide
   track 14180 has a shape that corresponds to a shape of the safety cover 14452. An inner
   surface 14185 of the slide track 14180, together with the side surface 14196 of the housing
    14110 define the grooves 14197 within which the safety cover 14452 is slidably disposed.

   14186 that extend distally from the spring pocket 14170 defined by the interior surface
   14166 of the top portion 14171 of the proximal cover 14162. Accordingly, the elongated
  protrusions 14186 partially enclose the safety cover spring 14464.
   [14621      The slide track 14180 has a proximal end portion 14181 and a distal end
  portion 14182. The slide track 14180 defines a longitudinal groove 14188 that extends
  from the proximal end portion 14181 to the distal end portion 14182. The groove 14188
  has a shape corresponding to and slightly larger than the cross-sectional shape of the
  retaining rod 14478. In this manner, the proximal end portion 14479 of the retaining rod
  14478 can be received within the groove 14188.
  [14631      The distal end portion 14182 of the slide track 14180 also includes a distal
  surface 14183 adjacent the groove 14188. As described above, when the auto-injector

  14166 defining an opening 14164 that receives a puncturing element 14620. The opening
 14164 is positioned such that the puncturing element             14620 is aligned with the
 compressed gas container 14412.         In some embodiments, for example, a longitudinal
 center line of the opening 14164 is coaxial with a longitudinal axis LE defined by the
compressed gas container 14412. Although the opening 14164 is shown as being a blind
hole, in other embodiments, the opening 14164 can be a through hole.

detail herein, the recess 14168 of the top portion 14171, the surface 14122 defining the
injector opening 14190 (see FIG. 111) and the proximal end surface 14322 of the movable
member 14312 (see FIG. 126) collectively define a gas chamber 14120.

   engages a gas release valve 14328 to maintain the gas release valve 14328 in a closed
   position. Moreover, when the auto-injector 14002 is in the first configuration, the

  [1468]       Although shown and described as being monolithically formed, in some
 embodiments, the top portion 14171 and the slide track 14180 can be formed separately
 and joined together to form the proximal cover 14162. Similarly, in some embodiments
 the proximal cover 14162 and the housing 14110 can be joined together by any suitable

second end 14364 thereof. The inner portion 14367 of the spring clip 14362 also includes
an angled surface 14372 extending distally from the point 14373, an engagement surface
 14370 and a curved surface 14371. In use, the angled surface 14372 engages the surface
 14194 of the-housing 14110- that defines the mixing spring opening 14191 (see FIG. 111),
 thereby causing the inner portion 14367 to bend outwardly (as indicated by the arrow CCC
 in FIGS. 118 and 128). In this manner, the engagement surface 14370 of the spring clip
 14362 can be disengaged from the corresponding engagement surface 14386 of the
 medicament mixer 14360, thereby decoupling the medicament mixer 14360 from the
 mixing spring 14436.
                                                                                       has a

  and 126, the proximal end portion 14389 of the plunger engagement portion 14388 is
  disposed through an opening 14317 defined by a side wall 14315 of the movable member
  14312 and within a lumen 14319 defined by the side wall 14315 of the movable member
  14312. The plunger engagement portion 14388 is also disposed through an opening 14321
  defined at the distal end portion 14318 of the movable member 14312 such that the distal
  end portion 14390 of the plunger engagement portion 14388 is disposed through an

  opening defined by the first plunger 14284 and into the medicament container 14262.
   shown in FIG. 125, the second plunger 14282 is coupled to the distal end portion 14390 of
   the plunger engagement portion 14388 by a plunger coupling 14392.
   114761     The junction portion 14394 of the medicament mixer 14360 is disposed
   between the proximal end portion 14383 of the spring engagement portion 14382 and the
   proximal end portion 14389 of the plunger engagement portion 14388. The junction
   portion 14394 defines an opening 14395 within which a pin 14396 is movably disposed.
   As described in more detail herein, when the injection operation is completed, the pin
    14396 actuates a gas release valve 14328 (see e.g., FIGS. 116 and 132) to allow the
   pressurized gas within the gas chamber 14120 to escape.

   [14771      This arrangement of the medicament mixer 14360 and the movable member
   14312 allows the medicament mixer 14360 to move with the movable member 14312,
   relative to the movable member 14312 and/or independently from the movable member
   14312. This arrangement of the medicament mixer 14360 and the movable member
   14312 also allows the medicament mixer 14360 to move in a first
                                                                               direction (e.g.,
  proximally) when the movable member 14312 is moving in a second direction opposite
  the first direction (e.g., distally). In this manner, as described in more detail herein, the
  medicament mixer 14360 can combine and/or mix the different medicaments contained in
  the medicament container 14262 to produce a mixture suitable for delivery via the auto
  injector 14002.
  [1478]       When the medicament and/or medicaments contained within the medicament
 container 14262 are suitably mixed, the auto-injector 14002 can be actuated by the system
 actuator 14510, which is configured to move the compressed gas container 14412 into
 engagement with a puncturing element 14620. As shown in FIGS. 109 and 120 - 124, the
 injection actuator 14510 include a base 14520, a retaining rod 14540, a spring 14560 and
 an actuation safety lock 14710.
 [1479]       Prior to actuation, the spring 14560 is disposed about the retaining rod 14540
 in a compressed configuration, such that the spring 14560 is retained by a proximal end
 portion 14542 of the retaining rod 14540 and a retention shoulder 14570 defined within
 the gas container opening 14124 of the housing 14110. In this manner, the retaining
                                                                                            rod
 14540 is spring-loaded such that when a distal end portion 14544 of the rod 14540
                                                                                              is
 decoupled from the retention shoulder 14570, the force of the spring 14560 causes the
retaining rod 14540, and therefore the compressed gas container 14412, to move
proximally within the housing 14110 along the longitudinal axis LE of the compressed gas
container 14412.
[14801        The distal end portion 14544 of the retaining rod 14540 includes two
extensions 14552 disposed apart from each other to define an opening 14554
therebetween. Each extension 14552 includes a projection 14548 having a tapered surface
14550 and an engagement surface 14549. As shown in FIG. 124, when the retaining
                                                                                           rod
14540 is in its first (or engaged) position, the engagement surfaces 14549 engage a distal
surface 14574 of a retention shoulder 14570 defined within the gas container opening
14124 defined by the housing 14110. Accordingly, when the retaining rod 14540 is in its

 WO 2007/126851                                                       PCT/US2007/007626

first position, the retaining rod 14540 is prevented from moving proximally along the
longitudinal axis LE. As described in more detail herein, when the base 14520 is moved
proximally towards the housing 14110 to actuate the auto-injector 14002, the tapered
surfaces 14550 of the projections 14548 cooperate with corresponding tapered surfaces
14524 defined by the base 14520 to move the extensions 14552 inwardly towards each
other. The inward motion of the extensions 14552 causes the engagement surfaces 14549
to become disengaged from the distal surface 14574 of the retention shoulder 14570,
thereby allowing the retaining rod 14540 to move between its first position (FIG. 1 10) and
a second (or actuated) position (FIG. 130).
[1481]       The proximal end portion 14542 of the retaining rod 14540 includes a retention
portion 14545 having a first surface 14547 and a second surface 14546. The first surface
 14547 of the retention portion 14545 engages the distal portion 14416 of the compressed
gas container 14412. The second surface 14546 of the retention portion 14545 engages a
proximal end 14562 of the spring 14560. A distal end 14564 of the spring 14560 engages
a proximal surface 14572 of the retention shoulder 14570. In this manner, when the
retaining rod 14540 is in its first position, the spring 14560 is compressed between the
retention shoulder 14570 and the retention portion 14545 of the retaining rod 14540.
Accordingly, when the retaining rod 14540 is disengaged from the retention shoulder
14570, the force imparted by the spring 14560 on the retention portion 14545 of the
retaining rod 14540 causes the retaining rod 14540 to move proximally along the
longitudinal axis LE into its second position (see e.g., FIG. 124 and 129).
114821       As shown in FIG. 121, the base 14520 includes a proximal portion 14521 and a
distal portion 14529. The distal portion 14529 of the base 14520 is movably coupled to
the distal end portion 14114 of the housing 14110 by two mounting screws 14174, as
shown in FIG. 109. The distal portion 14529 of the base 14520 defines two openings
14536 that receive the mounting screws 14174. In this manner, the movement and/or
alignment of the base 14520 relative to the housing 14110 is guided by the mounting
screws 14174 and the openings 14536.
[14831       The distal portion 14529 of the base 14520 also defines a needle opening
14532 and a retraction spring pocket 14531 within the needle opening 14532. When the
auto-injector 14002 is in its fourth configuration (see FIG. 130), the needle 14212 extends

    retraction spring 14350 is retained within the retraction spring pocket 14531.
     [14841      The distal portion 14529 of the base 14520 defines a proximally facing
    projection 14523 that defines a top opening 14523 and two side openings 14525.

125, the first plunger 14284 is disposed in a first position within proximal end portion
14264 of the medicament container 14262. The second plunger 14282 is disposed in a
second position distally from the first plunger 14284 such a first medicament containing
portion 14283 having a volume VI is defined between the first plunger 14284 and the
second plunger 14282. Similarly, a second medicament containing portion 14285 having
a volume V2 is defined between the second plunger 14282 and the frangible seal 14270.
In some embodiments, the medicament container 14262 can include a first medicament
14268 (e.g., water) within the first medicament containing portion 14283 and a second
medicament 14269 (e.g., a lyophilized powder) within the second medicament containing
portion 14285.
[14951      The first plunger 14284 forms a fluid-tight seal when disposed within the
medicament container 14262. Accordingly, when the first plunger 14284 moves within
the medicament container 14262, the portions within the medicament container 14262
distally disposed from the first plunger 14284 (e.g., the first medicament containing
portion 14283 and/or the second medicament containing portion 14285) remain fluidically
isolated from the portions within the medicament container 14262 proximally disposed
from the first plunger 14284.
 [1496]      The second plunger 14282 also forms a fluid-tight seal when stationary within
the medicament container 14262. However, when the second plunger 14282 moves within
the medicament container 14262, the flexible portions 14277 of the second plunger 14282
 can deform thereby allowing the portions within the medicament container 14262 distally
disposed from the first plunger 14284 (e.g., the second medicament containing portion
 14285) to be in fluid communication with       portions within the medicament container
 14262 proximally disposed from the first plunger 14284 (e.g., the first medicament
 containing portion 14283).
 [1497]      The needle 14212 is coupled to the distal end portion 14266 of the medicament
 container 14262 such that a lumen 14217 defined by the needle 14212 is in fluid
 communication with a portion of the medicament container disposed distally from the
 frangible seal 14270.   Accordingly, when the frangible seal 14270 is broken, the first
 medicament containing portion 12283 and/or the second medicament containing portion
  12285 are in fluid communication with the lumen 14217 defined by the needle 14212.

[14981      As shown in FIGS. 126 and 127, the movable member 14312 includes a
proximal end portion 14316 and a distal end portion 14318. The distal end portion 14318
of the movable member 14312 is disposed within the proximal portion 14264 of the
medicament container 14262 such that the distal end portion 14318 engages the first
plunger 14284. The movable member 14312 includes a side wall 14315 that extends
longitudinally from the proximal end portion 14316 to the distal end portion 14318. The
side wall 14315 defines a lumen 14319 and an opening 14317. As described above with
reference to FIGS. 116 and 117, the-plunger engagement portion 14388 of the medicament
mixer 14360 is disposed through the opening 14317 and within the lumen 14319. The
distal end portion 14318 of the movable member 14312 also defines an opening 14321
through which the plunger engagement portion 14388 is disposed.
 [14991     The proximal end portion 14316 of the movable member 14312 includes a
surface 14322 that, together with the interior surface 14166 of the proximal cover 14162
(see FIG. 114) and the surface 14122 defining the injector opening 14190 (see FIG. 111),
defines a gas chamber 14120. Said another way, the surface 14322 defines a portion of a
boundary of the gas chamber 14120.
 [15001     The proximal end portion 14316 of the movable member 14312 also includes a
seal 14314 that engages a portion the inner surface 14122 of the housing 14110 (see FIG.
 130) to fluidically isolate the gas chamber 14120. Although the seal 14314 is shown as
being an o-ring seal, in some embodiments, the seal need not be a separate component, but
can rather be a portion of the proximal end portion 14316 of the movable member 14312.
 [15011      As shown in FIGS. 126 and 127, the proximal end portion 14316 of the
movable member 14312 defines an opening 14326 therethrough which is in fluid
 communication between the gas chamber 14120 and the interior of the housing 14110
 outside the gas chamber 14120. The proximal end portion 14316 further defines two slots
 14330 that receive a gas relief valve 14328, which can be, for example, a flexible rubber
 member. The gas relief valve 14328 is positioned within the slots 14330 and adjacent the
 opening 14326 to selectively allow fluid communication between the gas chamber 14120
 and the area outside the gas chamber 14120 through the opening 14326.
 [1502]      As described in more detail herein, when the injection actuator 14510 is
 actuated, the movable member 14312 moves towards the distal end portion 14114 of the

 WO 2007/126851                                                       PCT/US2007/007626

housing 14110, in response to a force produced by a pressurized gas on the surface 14322
of the movable member 14312. As a result, the medicament container 14262 is moved
towards the distal end portion 14114 of the housing 14110, thereby exposing the needle
 14212 from the housing 14110. The movable member 14312 then continues to move
within the medicament container 14262 break the frangible seal 14270 and expel a
medicament from the medicament container 14262 through the needle 14212.
[15031      As discussed above, the use and actuation of the .auto-injector 14002 includes
several discrete operations, as shown in FIGS. 110 and 128 - 132. Although FIGS. 110
and 128 - 132 show the same components of the auto-injector 14002, certain reference
numerals are omitted in some of the figures for clarity. First, the mixing actuator 14450 is
enabled by moving the safety cover 14452 proximally to expose the mixing actuator
button 14468 (see FIG. 128).       Second, the medicament mixer 14360 is actuated by
pressing the mixing actuator button 14468 inward (see FIG. 128). When the medicament
mixer 14360 is actuated, the force from the mixing spring 14436 causes the medicament
mixer 14360 to move proximally within the housing 14110.            Accordingly, the second
plunger 14282 moves proximally within the medicament container 14262 to mix and/or
combine the first medicament 14268 and the second medicament 14269.
[1504]      Upon completion of the mixing operation, the medicament injector 14210 is
enabled by removing the safety lock 14710 (see FIG. 129).          The medicament injector
 14210 is then actuated by moving the base 14520 proximally towards the housing 14110.
When the medicament injector 14210 is actuated, the compressed gas container 14412 is
moved into engagement with the puncturing member 14620, which causes the pressurized
gas to be released into the gas chamber 14120 (see FIG. 130).           The pressurized gas
produces a force that causes the movable member 14312 and the medicament container
 14262 to move distally within the housing 14110 to extend the needle 14212 from distal
end portion 14114 of the housing 14110 and the base 14520 (see FIG. 130).               This
operation can be referred to as the "needle insertion" operation. When the medicament
container 14262 has completed its distal movement (i.e., the needle insertion operation is
complete), the force from the movable member 14312 on the first plunger 14284 causes
the frangible seal 14270 to break, thereby placing the second medicament containing
portion 14285 in fluid communication with the needle 14212. Accordingly, the movable
member 14312 moves within the medicament container 14262, thereby expelling the
mixed medicament through the needle 14212 (see FIG. 131).            This operation can be

     gas is released from the gas chamber 14120, thereby allowing the medicament

[15151      After the auto-injector 14002 is in the second configuration (FIG. 128), in
some embodiments, the user can enhance the mixing, for example, by shaking the auto
injector 14002. Because the mixing process occurs at a substantially constant volume, the
pressure within the first medicament containing portion 14283 and the second medicament
containing portion 14285 remains substantially constant throughout the mixing process.
Additionally, the medicament mixer 14360 is actuated independently from and using a
separate energy storage member (e.g., the mixing spring 14436) from the medicament
injector 14210;     This arrangement-can prevent premature breaking of the frangible seal
 14270 which can result in the medicament being injected before the auto-injector 14002 is
actuated. Moreover, because the mixing process occurs at a substantially constant volume,
in some embodiments, the first medicament containing portion 14283 and/or the second
medicament containing portion 14285 can be devoid of a gas (e.g., the first medicament
 14268 and/or the second medicament 14269 can be stored in a vacuum).
 [1516]      Similarly, because the first plunger 14284 remains substantially in the first
 position within the medicament container 14262 when the second plunger 14282 moves
 proximally within the medicament container 14262 from the second position to the third
 position, the flow rate of the first medicament 14268 into the second medicament
 containing portion 14285 is dependent only on the velocity of the second plunger 14282
 when moving between the second position and the third position. Accordingly, the flow
 rate of the first medicament 14268 can be adjusted by adjusting the velocity of the second
 plunger 14282 when moving between the second position and the third position. For
 example, in some embodiments, a high flow rate may be desired to enhance mixing (e.g.,
 by creating a turbulent flow of first medicament 14268 into the second medicament
 containing portion 14285). The velocity of the second plunger 14282 can be adjusted, for
 example, by increasing the stiffness (i.e., the spring constant) of the mixing spring 14436.
  [15171     The mixing safety lock 14766 (see FIG. 118) moves proximally within the
 housing along with the spring clip 14362 when the mixing spring 14436 moves from its
  compressed     configuration  (FIG.  110)    to its  expanded    configuration   (FIG.   128).
 Accordingly, when the auto-injector 14002 is in the second configuration (FIG. 128), the
  protrusions 14766 extending from the distal end portion 14764 of the mixing safety lock
  14760 are moved outside of the openings 14719 defined by the inwardly facing
  protrusions 14718 of the actuation safety lock 14710 (see FIG. 120). In this manner, when

 WO 2007/126851                                                       PCT/US2007/007626
                                           129
the auto-injector 14002 is in the second configuration, the actuation safety lock 14710 can
be removed.
115181      During the mixing operation, when the spring clip 14362 moves proximally
within the housing 14110 from a first (i.e., distal) position to a second (i.e., proximal)
position. When the spring clip 14362 moves from its first position to its second position,
the angled surface 14372 of the spring clip 14362 engages the surface 14194 of the
housing 14110, thereby causing the inner portion 14367 to bend outwardly, as indicated by
the arrow CCC in FIG. 128, when the spring clip 14362 moves proximally. Accordingly,
when the spring clip 14362 is in its second position, as shown in FIG. 128, the engagement
surface 14370 of the spring clip 14362 is disengaged from the engagement surface 14386
of the medicament mixer 14360, thereby decoupling the medicament mixer 14360 from
the mixing spring 14436.      The curved surface 14371 (see FIG. 119) of the clip 14362
improves the ease with which the medicament mixer 14360 is decoupled from the mixing
spring 14436.      Said another way, the curved surface 14371 helps to prevent the
engagement surface 14370 of the spring clip 14362 from becoming bound with the
engagement surface 14386 of the medicament mixer 14360 (e.g., by burrs, surface
roughness or the like). In this manner, when the medicament mixer 14360 moves distally
within the housing during the needle insertion and/or injection operations, the mixing
spring 14436 is not compressed. Moreover, when the spring clip 14362 is in its second
position, the point 14373 at the second end 14364 of the spring clip 14362 is received
within the opening 14475 of the mixing actuator button 14468 (see FIG. 113).
[15191      FIG. 129 shows the auto-injector 14002 in a third configuration, in which the
injection actuator 14510 of the auto-injector 14002 has been actuated. Before the injection
actuator 14510 can be actuated, the actuation safety lock 14710 must be removed.         As
shown by the arrow GGG in FIG. 129, the actuation safety lock 14710 is removed by
pulling it substantially normal to the longitudinal axis LE of the compressed gas container
14412. When the actuation safety lock 14710 is removed, the locking protrusion 14722
(see FIG. 120) is removed from the area between the projections 14548 of the retaining
rod 14540 and the opening 14522 defined by the base 14520.
[1520]      After the actuation safety lock 14710 is removed, the base 14520 can be moved
proximally, as shown by the arrow HHH in FIG. 129, to actuate the medicament injector
14210. When the base 14520 is moved proximally towards the housing 14110, the tapered

  completed.    Said another way, the needle insertion operation is distinct from the
  medicament injection operation.
  [1524]     When the auto-injector 14002 is moving between the third configuration (FIG.
   129) and the fourth configuration (FIG. 130), a portion of the spring clip 14362 moves
  within the longitudinal opening 14385 of the spring engagement portion 14382 of the
  medicament mixer 14360 (see FIG. 116). In this manner, the medicament injector 14210
  can move distally within the housing without compressing the mixing spring 14436.
  [1525]     During the needle insertion operation, the volume V2' of the second
 medicament containing portion 14285 and the volume VI' of the first medicament
 containing portion 14283 remain substantially constant. In this manner, the needle
 insertion operation is independent from the medicament injection operation. As shown in
 FIG. 130, when the needle insertion operation is completed, the retraction spring 14350 is
 fully compressed, preventing further distal movement of the medicament container 14262
 within the housing 14110. Because the distal motion of the medicament container 14262
 is opposed, the force exerted by the pressurized gas on the surface 14322 of the movable
 member 14312 increases until the frangible seal 14270 breaks, thereby placing the lumen
 14217 of the needle 14212 is in fluid communication with the second medicament
 containing portion 14285 of the medicament container 14262.
 [1526]      Once the needle 14212 is in fluid communication with the medicament
 container 14262, the force from the pressurized gas causes the movable member 14312 to
collectively move the first plunger 14284 and the second plunger 14282 within the
medicament container 14262, as shown by arrow KKK in FIG. 131, thereby expelling the
medicament through the needle 14212.            The movable member 14312 moves a
predetermined distance within the medicament container 14262, at which point the pin
 14396 (see FIG. 115) contacts the proximal portion 14264 of the medicament container
14262.     The continued distal movement of the movable member 14212 and the
medicament mixer 14360 moves the pin 14396 proximally within the opening 14395, as
shown by the arrow LLL in FIG. 131.        In this manner, the pin 14396 actuates the gas
release valve 14328 to allow the pressurized gas within the gas chamber 14120 to escape
via the opening 14326 in the movable member 14312.

    [15271     When the pressurized gas flows out of the gas chamber 14120, the pressure
    exerted on the surface 14322 of the movable member 14312 decreases.

   force exerted by the retraction springs 14350 is sufficient to move the medicament
                                                                                           injector

 [1529]       FIG. 133 is a flow chart of a method 15002 according to an embodiment

invention. The method 15002 includes moving a mixing plunger
                                                                         within a medicament
container toward a proximal end of the medicament container,
                                                                      15004.        As described
above, the medicament container includes the mixing plunger and
                                                                         an injection plunger.
The injection plunger is disposed at the proximal end of the medicament
                                                                                 container. The
mixing plunger is disposed within the medicament container between
                                                                             a distal end of the
medicament container and the injection plunger. In this
                                                                    manner, the medicament
container can define a first medicament containing portion between
                                                                         the injection plunger
and the mixing plunger. Similarly, the medicament container
                                                                        can define a second
medicament containing portion between the mixing plunger a distal
                                                                            end portion of the
medicament container.

  WO 2007/126851                                                       PCT/US2007/007626

 [1530]      The injection plunger is then moved within the medicament container toward a
 distal end of the medicament container to expel a medicament contained within the
 medicament container, 15010.
 115311      In some embodiments, the first medicament containing portion and the second
 medicament containing portion are placed in fluid communication when the mixing
 plunger moves, thereby allowing a substance contained in the first medicament containing
 portion to be conveyed into the second medicament containing portion. For example, in
 some embodiments, the first medicament containing portion can include a liquid substance
 and the    second medicament       containing portion   can include     a solid substance.
 Accordingly, when the mixing plunger moves, the solid substance can be mixed and/or
 combined with the liquid substance to produce the medicament.
 [1532]      In some embodiments, the mixing plunger can be moved without moving the
 injection plunger.   In this manner, as described above, the total volume of the first
 medicament containing portion and the second medicament containing portion remains
 constant when the mixing plunger is moved.        Accordingly, a first medicament and a
 second medicament can be mixed at a substantially constant volume and/or a substantially
constant pressure.
 [15331     In some embodiments, the mixing plunger can be moved by actuating a first
energy storage member, such as, for example, a spring, an electronic actuator, a magnetic
actuator, a pneumatic actuator (e.g., a compressed gas container) and/or a hydraulic
actuator.   Similarly, the injection plunger can be moved by actuating a second energy
storage member different than the first energy storage member.
[1534]      In some embodiments, the method 15002 can optionally include moving the
medicament container within a housing of a medical injector, 15006. In this manner, as
described above, a needle can be disposed from a distal end of the housing. Similarly, in
some embodiments, the method 15002 can optionally include placing the needle in fluid
communication with the medicament container, 15008.            In this manner, the mixing
operation (e.g., operation 15004) and the insertion operation (e.g., operation 15006) can be
done independently from the injection operation (15010).
[15351      In some embodiments, the method 15002 can optionally include retracting the
needle into the housing, 15012.

[15361      Although the auto-injectors are shown and described above as including a
mixing plunger configured to move proximally within a medicament container, in some
embodiments, an auto-injector can include a mixing plunger configured to move either
proximally or distally within a medicament container. For example, FIGS. 134 - 136 are
schematic illustrations of a medical device 16002 according to an embodiment of the
invention in a first configuration, a second configuration and a third configuration,
respectively.   The medical device 16002 can be any suitable device for delivering a
medicament into a body, such as for example, -a syringe, a medical injector, an auto
injector or the like. The medical device 16002 includes a housing 16110 that contains a
medicament container 16262, a first energy storage member 16412 and a second energy
storage member 16436.
[15371      The medicament container 16262 has a proximal end portion 16264 and a
distal end portion 16266. The medicament container 16262 includes a first plunger 16284
and a second plunger 16282. As shown in FIG. 134, when the medical device 16002 is in
the first configuration, the first plunger 16284 is disposed in a first position within the
medicament container 16262. The second plunger 16282 is disposed in a second position
within the medicament container 16262. The second position is spaced apart from the first
position such that a first medicament containing portion 16283 is defined between the first
plunger 16284 and the second plunger 16282. Similarly, a second medicament containing
portion 16285 is defined between the second plunger 16282 and the distal end portion
16266 of the medicament container 16262. As described above, in some embodiments,
the first medicament containing portion 16283 can include a liquid medicament 16268,
such as a water, and the second medicament containing portion 16285 can include a
second medicament 16269, such as a lyophilized powder.
[15381      The first energy storage member 16412 is operatively coupled to the first
plunger 16284 by a first movable member 16312. Although the first movable member
16312 is shown as being physically coupled to the first energy storage member 16412 and
the first plunger 16284, in some embodiments, the first movable member 16312 can be
electronically coupled to the first energy storage member 16412 and/or the first plunger
16284. Similarly, the second energy storage member 16436 is operatively coupled to the
second plunger 16282 by a second movable member 16360.               Although the second
movable member 16360 is shown as being physically coupled to the second energy
storage member 16436 and the second plunger 16282, in some embodiments, the second

  movable member 16360 can be electronically coupled to the second energy storage
  member 16436 and/or the second plunger 16282.
  [1539]      The first energy storage member 16412 and/or the second energy storage
  member 16436 can be any suitable energy storage member configured to produce a force
  when moved between a first configuration (FIG. 134) and a second configuration (FIGS.
  135 and 136). The first energy storage member 16412 and/or the second energy storage
  member 16436 can be, for example, a mechanical energy storage member (e.g., a spring),
  an electrical energy storage member (e.g., a battery or a capacitor), a chemical energy
  storage member (e.g., a container containing two substances that can react to produce
  energy), a magnetic energy storage member or the like. In some embodiments, the first
 energy storage member 16412 can be of a different type than the second energy storage
 member 16436.
  [1540]      As shown in FIG. 135, when the medical device 16002 is in the second
 configuration, the second energy storage member 16436 is in a second configuration.
 Accordingly, the second energy storage member 16436 produces a force to move the
 second plunger 16282 within the medicament container 16262, as shown by the arrow
 NNN in FIG. 135. When the medical device 16002 is in the second configuration, the
 second plunger 16282 can be moved either proximally or distally within the medicament
 container.
 [1541]      In some embodiments, the first medicament containing portion 16283 can be
fluidically isolated from the second medicament containing portion 16285 when the
medical device 16002 is in the first configuration.      The first medicament containing
portion 16283 can be in fluid communication with the second medicament containing
portion 16285 when the medical device 16002 is moving from the first configuration to
the second configuration, as shown by the arrow 000 in FIG. 135. Accordingly, as
described above, the medical device 16002 can combine and/or mix the first medicament
16268 with the second medicament 16269 contained in the second medicament containing
portion 16285 to produce a mixture suitable for delivery via the medical device 16002.
[1542]       As shown in FIG. 136, when the medical device 16002 is in the third
configuration, the first energy storage member 16412 is in a second configuration.
Accordingly, the first energy storage member 16412 produces a force to move the first

configuration, the first plunger 16284 and the second plunger 16282 are collectively
moved distally within the medicament container 16262.            In this manner, the first
medicament 16268 and the second medicament 16269 can be collectively expelled from
the distal end portion 16266 of the medicament container 16262 (e.g., via a needle).
 [15431     _Because the auto-injector 16002 includes-a first energy storage member 16412
and a second energy storage member 16436 different from the first energy storage
member, the first plunger 16284 and the second plunger 16282 can be moved
independently from each other. For example, in some embodiments, the second plunger
 16282 can be repeatedly moved proximally and distally within the medicament container
 16262 to mix the first medicament 16268 and the second medicament 16269. In other
embodiments, the second plunger 16282 can move in a first direction (e.g., proximally)
when the first plunger 16284 is moving in a second direction opposite the first direction
(e.g., distally) to mix the first medicament 16268 and the second medicament 16269. This
arrangement ensures that the mixing operation and the injection operations are distinct
from each other.
 [15441      Although the auto-injectors are shown and described above as including
different energy storage members, in some embodiments an auto-injector can include one
energy storage member configured to independently move a mixing plunger and an
injection plunger. For example, FIG. 137 is a schematic illustration of a medical device
 17002 according to an embodiment of the invention. The medical device 17002 includes a
housing 17110 that contains a medicament container 17262 and an energy storage member
 17412, such as, for example, a compressed gas container.
 [15451       The medicament container 17262 has a proximal end portion 17264 and a
distal end portion 17266. The medicament container 17262 includes a first plunger 17284
and a second plunger 17282. As described above, when the medical device 17002 is in its
initial configuration, the first plunger 17284 and the second plunger 17282 are arranged
within the medicament container to define a first medicament containing portion 17283
and a second medicament containing portion 17285.            As described above, in some
embodiments, the first medicament containing portion 17283 can include a liquid

    WO 2007/126851                                                       PCT/US2007/007626
                                             137
    medicament 17268 and the second medicament containing portion 17285 can include a
    solid medicament 17269 (e.g., a lyophilized powder).
    [1546]      The energy storage member 17412 is operatively coupled to the first plunger
    17284 by a first movable member 17312. Similarly, the energy storage member 17412 is
    operatively coupled to the second plunger 17282 by a second movable member 17360. A
    switch 17413 is operatively disposed between the first movable member 17312, the second
   movable member 14360 and the energy storage member 17412. In use, the switch, which
   can be a valve, a mechanical linkage, an electronic switch or the like, selectively transmits
   the force produced by the energy storage member 17412 to the first movable member
   17312 and the second movable member 14360. In this manner, the first plunger 17284
   and the second plunger 17282 can be moved independently from each other by the energy
   storage member 17412.
   [1547]      For example, in some embodiments, the second plunger 17282 can be moved
  proximally within the medicament container 17262 to mix the first medicament 16268 and
  the second medicament 16269. When the second movable member 17360 reaches a
  predetermined point, the second movable member 17360 can actuate the switch
                                                                                         17413,
  thereby operatively disconnecting the energy storage member 17412 from the second
 movable member 17360 and operatively coupling the energy storage member 17412 to the
 first movable member 17312. As described above, this arrangement ensures that the
 mixing operation and the injection operations are distinct from each other.
 [15481       While various embodiments of the invention have been described above, it
 should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not
 limitation. Where methods described above indicate certain events occurring in certain
order, the ordering of certain events may be modified. Additionally, certain of the events
may be performed concurrently in a parallel process when possible, as well as performed
sequentially as described above.
[1549]        Although various embodiments have been described as having particular
features and/or combinations of components, other embodiments are possible having a
combination of any features and/or components from any of embodiments where
appropriate. For example, in some embodiments, an auto-injector can include multiple
medicament selectors and a medicament mixer. In this manner, a user can first select the

 WO 2007/126851                                                   PCT/US2007/007626
                                        138
type and/or amount of a first medicament and the type and/or amount of a second
medicament to be mixed to produce an injectable medicament.
[1550]     Certain components of the auto-injector 14002 are shown and described as
being coupled together via protrusions and mating recesses.      The protrusions and/or
recesses can be disposed on any of the components to be coupled together and need not be
limited to only a certain component.    For example, the actuation safety lock 14710 is
shown as defining two openings 14719 that receive corresponding protrusions 14766
extending from the distal end portion 14764 of the mixing safety lock 14760. In some
embodiments, however, the protrusions can be disposed on the actuation safety lock and
the mating openings can be defined by the mixing safety lock. In other embodiments, two
or more components can be coupled together in any suitable way, which need not include
protrusions and mating recesses.     For example, in some embodiments, two or more
components can be coupled together via mating shoulders, clips, adhesive and the like.
[1551]     Similarly, although certain components of the auto-injector 14002 are shown
and described as being constructed from multiple separate components, in some
embodiments, such components can be monolithically constructed.        For example, the
proximal cover 14162 is shown and described as including a spring clip 14362 and a
mixing actuator safety lock 14760 that are constructed separately and then coupled
together. In other embodiments, a spring clip and a mixing actuator safety lock can be
constructed monolithically.
[15521     Although the second plunger 14282 is shown and described as being coupled to
the medicament mixer 14360 by a plunger coupling 14392 that is disposed within the
second plunger 14282, in other embodiments the second plunger 14282 can be coupled to
the medicament mixer 14360 by any suitable means. For example, in some embodiments,
a second plunger can be coupled to a medicament mixer by an adhesive.            In other
embodiments, a second plunger can be pivotably coupled to a medicament mixer by a ball
and socket joint.   In yet other embodiments, a second plunger can be coupled to a
medicament mixer by a plunger coupling that engages the distal surface of the second
plunger.
[1553]     Although the medicament containers shown and described above include two
plunger and two medicament containing portions, in some embodiments, a medicament

  WO 2007/126851                                                      PCT/US2007/007626
                                           139
container can include more than two plungers and/or more than two medicament
containing portions.     For example, in some embodiments a medicament container can
include a first medicament containing portion configured to contain a first medicament, a
second medicament containing portion configured to store contain a second medicament
and mixing portion configured to receive and mix the first medicament and the second
medicament when the mixing actuator is actuated.
[1554]        Although the rod 14540 is shown and described as being an elongated member
that is released by being elastically deformed, in some embodiments, a rod can be of any
suitable shape and in any suitable orientation within the housing. Moreover, in some
embodiments, a rod can be released by being plastically deformed. For example, in some
embodiments, a rod can be disposed along an axis that is offset from the longitudinal axis
of the energy storage member. In some embodiments, the rod can be configured to break
upon actuation.
 [1555]       Although the spring clip 14362 is shown and described above as being
deformable to decouple the medicament mixer 14360 from mixing spring 14436 after the
 auto-injector 14002 is in the second configuration (FIG. 128), in other embodiments, the
medicament mixer 14360 can be decoupled from the mixing spring 14436 in any suitable
manner.      For example, in some embodiments, the medicament mixer 14360 can be
 coupled to the mixing spring 14436 by a frangible clip configured to break when the auto
 injector is in the second configuration.
 [1556]       Although the auto-injector 14002 is shown and described above without
 reference to a needle guard, in other embodiments an -auto-injector can include any
 suitable needle guard. For example, in some embodiments, an auto-injector can include a
 rigid needle guard. In other embodiments, an auto-injector can include a flexible needle
 guard.    In other embodiments, an auto-injector can include a needle guard that also
 functions as a mixing actuator safety cover (e.g., removal of the needle guard also enables
 the mixing actuator). Such needle guards can be made of any suitable material, such as,
 for example, polypropylene, rubber or any other elastomer.
 [1557]       Although the auto-injector 14002 is shown and described as including a
 puncturing element 14620 to puncture a portion of the compressed gas container 14412, in
 other embodiments any suitable gas release mechanism can be used. For example, in

  WO 2007/126851                                                    PCT/US2007/007626
                                           140
some embodiments, a gas release mechanism can include an actuator configured to actuate
a valve that controls the flow of gas out of the compressed gas container. In some
embodiments, a compressed gas container can include a spring loaded check ball and the
gas release mechanism can include an actuator configured to engage and depress the check
ball to release pressurized gas from the compressed gas container.
[15581       Although the auto-injector 14002 is shown and described as including a
compressed gas cylinder 14412, in other embodiments an-auto-injector can include any
suitable energy storage member. For example, in some embodiments, an auto-injector can
include a mechanical energy storage member, such as a spring, an electrical energy storage
member, such as a battery or a capacitor, a chemical energy storage member, such as a
container containing two substances that can react to produce energy, a magnetic energy
storage member or the like. Similarly, although the auto-injector 14002 is shown and
described as including a mixing spring 14436, in other embodiments an auto-injector can
include any suitable energy storage member to move the medicament mixer.
 [15591      Although the auto-injector 14002 has been shown and described having a
housing 14110 having a substantially rectangular shape, in some embodiments, an auto
injector can have a housing having any shape. In some embodiments, for example, an
auto-injector can have a substantially cylindrical shape. In other embodiments, for
example, the auto-injector can have an irregular and/or asymmetrical shape.
 [15601      Although the auto-injectors are shown and described above as including a
mixing plunger that moves within a medicament container to combine and/or mix a first
 medicament and a second medicament, in some embodiments, the user can shake the auto
 injector to enhance the mixing process.       In other embodiments, an auto-injector can
 include an agitator to enhance the mixing process. For example, FIGS. 138 and 139 show
 a medicament container 18262 according to an embodiment of the invention in a first
 configuration and a second configuration, respectively. The medicament container 18262
 includes a proximal end portion 18264 and a distal end portion 18266. The medicament
 container 18262 includes a first plunger 18284, a second plunger 18282 and an agitator
 18299.
 [15611      The second plunger 18282 is disposed distally from the first plunger 18284.
 The first plunger 18284 and the second plunger 18282 are each movably disposed within

 WO 2007/126851                                                         PCT/US2007/007626
                                           141
 the medicament container 18262. The agitator, which can be, for example, a flexible wire,
 an elastic member or the like, is coupled to the second plunger 18282.
 [1562]      As shown in FIG. 138, when the medical device 18002 is in the first
 configuration, the first plunger 18284 is disposed in a first position within the medicament
 container 18262. The second plunger 18282 is disposed in a second position within the
 medicament container 18262. The second position is spaced apart from the first position
 such that a first medicament containing portion- 18283 is defined between the first plunger
 18284 and the second plunger 18282. Similarly, a second medicament containing portion
 18285 is defined between the second plunger 18282 and the distal end portion 18266 of
the medicament container 18262.
 [15631      As described above, when the second plunger 18282 moves within the
medicament container 18262, the first medicament containing portion 18283 is placed in
fluid communication with the second medicament containing portion 18285. Accordingly,
when the second plunger 18282 moves, the contents of the first medicament containing
portion 18283 can be mixed with the contents of the second medicament containing
portion 18285.
 [1564]      When the medicament container 18262 moves from the first configuration
(FIG. 138) to the second configuration (FIG. 139), the agitator moves from its retracted
position to an expanded position. In this manner, the agitator can enhance the mixing of
the medicaments contained in the medicament container 18262.
[15651       Although the agitator 18299 is described as a flexible member, in other
embodiments, an agitator can include any suitable mechanism for enhancing the mixing of
medicaments within the medicament container. For example, in some embodiments, an
agitator can include angled flow passages within the second plunger to produce a swirl
effect when the first medicament containing portion is placed in fluid communication with
the second medicament containing portion. In other embodiments, fluid communication
between the first medicament containing portion and the second medicament containing
portion can be established by a channel within a side wall of the medicament container. In
such embodiments, the channel can be a spiral channel to produce a turbulent flow to
enhance the mixing of medicaments within the medicament container.

  WO 2007/126851                                                     PCT/US2007/007626
                                          142
 [1566]      Although the auto-injector 14002 is shown and described as mixing the
medicaments contained therein at a substantially constant volume, which can allow the
first medicament containing portion 14283 and/or the second medicament containing
portion 14285 to be devoid of a gas, in other embodiments, the first medicament
 containing portion 14283 and/or the second medicament containing portion 14285 can
contain a gas (e.g., air). In such embodiments, an auto-injector can include an air purge
valve to purge the air contained within the medicament after the medicament is mixed, but
before the medicament is injected. Such an air purge valve can be operatively coupled to
the actuation safety lock and/or the medicament mixer.
 [15671     Although the auto-injector 14002 is shown and described as being devoid of an
electronic circuit system, in other embodiments, an auto-injector can include an electronic
circuit system configured to output an electronic output. Such an electronic circuit system
can be an electronic circuit system of the types shown and described in U.S. Patent
Application    Serial No.    11/671,025,  entitled "Devices,   Systems and Methods       for
Medicament Delivery," filed February 5, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference
in its entirety.    For example, in some embodiments, an auto-injector can include a
electronic circuit system configured to sense the status of the medicaments contained
therein (e.g., unmixed, partially mixed, fully mixed, or the like) and output an electronic
output in response to such status. In other embodiments, an auto-injector can include an
electronic circuit system configured to output an instruction associated with the mixing
operation as described herein.
[1568]      Although the medical device are shown and described above as being
medicament      delivery  device including a medicament       and/or a needle,    in other
embodiments, a medical device can be a simulated medicament delivery device. In some
embodiments, for example, a simulated auto-injector can correspond to an actual auto
injector (e.g., auto-injector 14002) and can be used, for example, to train a user in the
operation of the corresponding actual auto-injector.
[15691      In some embodiments,        a simulated  auto-injector can be devoid       of a
medicament and/or those components that cause the medicament to be delivered (e.g., a
needle). In this manner, the simulated auto-injector can be used to train a user in the use
of the actual medicament delivery device without exposing the user to a needle and/or a
medicament. Moreover, the simulated auto-injector can have features to identify it as a

 WO 2007/126851                                                      PCT/US2007/007626
                                         143
training device to prevent a user from mistakenly believing that the simulated auto-injector
can be used to deliver a medicament.       Examples of such simulated auto-injectors are
described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/679,331, entitled "Medical Injector
Simulation Device," filed February 27, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference in
its entirety.
