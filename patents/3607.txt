                                    ABSTRACT
               FLUID DISPENSER WITH INCREASED STABILITY
A dispenser with increased stability includes a pillar tube (12) extending from
the stem-spring chamber assembly (208, 212) at the top of the fluid reservoir
(216) to the bottom surface (217) of the fluid reservoir (216). The pillar tube (12)
transmits the force that the user employs to dispense fluid from the hand of the
user to a pressure sensitive attachment device (202) at the bottom surface
(217) of the fluid reservoir (216).

 [0001]         For prosecution in the United States, this international
application is a Continuation-in-Part Application of Non-Provisional U.S.
Patent Application No. 13/420,447, filed 14 March 2012, which in turn claims

STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH AND
 DEVELOPMENT
 [0002]         The invention described in this patent application was not the
subject of federally sponsored research or development.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0003]          The present invention pertains to fluid dispensers; more
particularly, the present invention pertains to those fluid dispensers typically
located on the edge of a sink and typically providing a user with small
amounts of liquid soap, other liquids, lotion, or an atomized or mist spray.
BACKGROUND ART
[0004]          An analysis of the forces on a dispenser typically found on the
edge of a sink reveals that the action of placing manual force on the top of the
dispenser to dispense a small amount of fluid will cause the dispenser to tip
over or to move over the surface on which the dispenser rests, unless the
user happens to be exerting a force that is vertically above the center of
gravity of the dispenser.
                                         1

 (0005]          The numerous parts included in the top portion of such a
 dispenser create its high center of gravity, thus producing a dispenser
 instability that makes the dispenser liable to tip over when the hand of the
 user is placed thereon.
 (0006]          Furthermore, dispensers that are close to being empty are less
 stable and more prone to being tipped over or moving over the surfaces upon
 which they rest when the force from a user's hand is exerted on them.
 (0007]          Some dispensers are relatively tall compared to the diameters of
 their bottom surfaces. Such dispensers also tend to tip over when the force of
 a user's hand is exerted on them to dispense a small amount of fluid.
 (0008]          While liquid is contained in a dispenser, it is not unusual for a
 small amount of dispensed liquid to either seep underneath or flow around the
 bottom surface of the dispenser. This small amount of dispensed liquid will
 make the surface upon which the dispenser rests slippery. The resulting
 effect is that the frictional forces that prevent the dispenser from moving
 across the surface on which it rests are reduced.
 (0009]          Several attempts to prevent a dispenser from tipping over or
sliding over the surface on which it rests have been made. These attempts
include shaping a dispenser to have a relatively large bottom surface;
constructing the bottom portion of the dispenser from a relatively heavy
material; making the entire dispenser from a relatively heavy material; placing
the dispenser within a stable basket or wire frame; or, some combination of
the foregoing. These attempts to solve the problem of instability of a
dispenser generally prevent the dispenser from tipping over or moving over
                                            2

the surface on which it rests by causing the dispenser to have a lower center
 of gravity and/or greater total mass.
 [0010]        Another common way of keeping a dispenser, particularly a
pump dispenser for liquid soap, from tipping over or moving over the surface
on which it rests has been to attach a suction cup to the bottom surface of the
dispenser. However, after an individual has endeavored to create a suction
connection of the suction cup to the surface on which the pump dispenser
 rests through the application of firm downward force on the main pump
dispenser structure, it takes only a short period of time for air to seep
underneath the edge of the suction cup. This seepage causes the suction
connection of the suction cup to the surface on which it rests to first weaken
and then to be lost entirely.
 [0011]        The period of time between uses of a pump dispenser having a
suction cup thereon is typically long enough to cause the suction connection
associated with the previous use of the pump dispenser to weaken or even be
lost. Once the suction connection is lost or weakened, for sufficient stability
the user must begin the next use of the dispenser by re-establishing or
reinforcing the suction connection.
[0012]         However, users of dispensers typically do not re-establish,
reinforce, or even check the suction connection at the bottom of a dispenser
prior to every use of the dispenser.
[0013]         It has been found that after the suction connection from the prior
use of the dispenser has been either lost or weakened, the first downward
stroke in the next use of the dispenser has the potential to cause the
dispenser to tip over or move over the surface on which it rests even when a
                                         3

 suction cup is attached to the bottom of the dispenser. The first downward
stroke in the use of a dispenser after the suction connection has been lost or
weakened does not reliably transmit force to the top of the suction cup at the
bottom of the dispenser in away that strongly and immediately re-establishes
or reinforces a suction connection, for reasons that will be explained below.
[0014]          The inability of the suction cup to reliably prevent a dispenser
from tipping over or sliding over as it is begun to be used is likely a significant
 reason that many manufacturers have apparently decided to stop attaching
suction cups to the bottom surfaces of their dispensers.
 [0015]         U.S. Pat. No. 2,736,468 to Hills, entitled "Liquid Soap
Dispenser," describes a convenient way of applying force to the top of a
suction cup attached to a dispenser to re-establish a suction connection. In
this reference, the fluid reservoir of the dispenser is shown as being attached
to a vertical surface. Therefore, the suction cup is attached to a side surface
of the fluid reservoir. To put force on the suction cup to establish a suction
connection, the user presses on the side surface of the fluid reservoir at the
location that is opposite to the attachment point of the suction cup. Two
inward, beam-like projections are affixed to the inner surface of the fluid
reservoir, at the attachment point of the suction cup and at the location that is
opposite to the attachment point of the suction cup. When the user presses
on the side surface of the fluid reservoir at the location that is opposite to the
attachment point of the suction cup, the projection located where the user
exerts force comes into contact with the projection located at the suction cup.
The suction cup is therefore depressed and the suction connection of the fluid
reservoir of the dispenser to the vertical surface is re-established.
                                           4

 [0016]        Although the invention in U.S. Pat. No. 2,736,468 provides an
 easier way of reestablishing a suction connection than having to grasp and
 push on a main dispenser structure, it still does not offer a solution to the
 greater problem of needing to actively re-establish or reinforce a lost or
weakened suction connection prior to each use of a dispenser.
 [0017]         U.S. Pat. No. 3,159,317 to Mini, also entitled "Liquid Soap
 Dispenser," does not discuss the stability of the dispenser it introduces-other
than describing a suction cup located at the bottom of the dispenser for "fixing
the container in place"-but the configuration of the dispenser does seem to
 permit a direct transmission of force from its actuation button to its suction
 cup, and this transmission of force appears to correspond to a re-establishing
or reinforcing of a weakened or lost suction connection whenever the user
pushes downwardly on the actuation button. However, the dispenser design
that was disclosed by Mini has certain problems. To begin with, the dispenser
includes an internal chamber positioned on the dispenser base. Because this
chamber is located at such a low position but is the part of the Mini dispenser
from which fluid enters the faucet of the dispenser and is then dispensed to
the user, the faucet emerges from a low position on the dispenser and
consequently provides relatively little room for one of the user's hands to be
positioned underneath it. Another undesirable aspect of the Mini design is
that the potential frictional and inertial effects mentioned by Mini in the context
of dispenser actuation suggest that there is a possible limit to the speed with
which the user can push downwardly on the actuation button while still
maintaining a fixed distance between the two pistons within the chamber of
the Mini dispenser, the maintenance of which is essential to the specified
                                           5

 metering function of the dispenser. Finally, a critical problem with this
dispenser is that it is designed to begin to dispense fluid by gravity only after
the actuation button has been moved a particular initial distance downwardly,
and is designed to actually begin to expel fluid only when the actuation button
has been moved yet further downwardly and a spring within the chamber has
thus begun to be compressed. Due to the need to move the actuation button
downwardly through a significant distance to even begin fluid dispensation, as
well as the possible need to limit the speed with which the actuation button is
moved, dispensation of fluid with the Mini dispenser can only occur with a
conspicuous time delay relative to the initial application of force by the user.
 Use of the Mini design for dispenser stability therefore does not seem to be
any more convenient than simply remembering to apply a firm downward
force on the main structure of a typical pump dispenser that has a suction cup
attached to its bottom surface. Accordingly, the need remains in the art for a
fluid dispenser that does not require an active re-establishment or
reinforcement of the suction connection of the dispenser to the surface on
which the dispenser rests prior to each use of the dispenser, and that
furthermore closely links the process of re-establishing or reinforcing suction
and the process of actually dispensing fluid.
 DISCLOSURE
[0018]         The disclosed invention provides a construction for a dispenser
that links the action of dispensing fluid from a dispenser to the re
establishment or reinforcement of the attachment of the dispenser to the
surface on which it rests.
                                          6

 [0019]        The disclosed construction for a dispenser involves the
placement of a force-sensitive attachment device, such as a suction cup, at
the bottom of a dispenser. The disclosed construction of a dispenser also
includes a spring chamber assembly at the top of the dispenser. The spring
chamber assembly receives force from the hand of the user and enables a
small quantity of fluid from within the fluid reservoir to be dispensed.
 Extending downwardly from the spring chamber assembly through the fluid
reservoir is an internal pillar tube. It is the internal pillar tube within the fluid
reservoir that transmits mechanical force to the force-sensitive attachment
device located on the bottom of the dispenser.
[0020]         Thus, the force exerted by the user on the top of the dispenser
not only dispenses a small quantity of fluid but .also quickly and firmly re
establishes or reinforces the attachment of the bottom of the dispenser to the
surface on which the dispenser rests.

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION
[0033)         Three types of dispensers will be used to exhibit embodiments
of the disclosed invention. The first of these dispensers will be a pump
                                          8

dispenser, where the force from the user's hand is used to dispense a small
amount of fluid. The second type of dispenser to be shown will be an aerosol
dispenser, where pressure from within the fluid reservoir propels fluid out of
the dispenser in the form of droplets as a result of a force on the dispenser
from the user's hand. The third type of dispenser to be shown will be a
Misto@-type dispenser, named in reference to the Misto@ Gourmet Olive Oil
Sprayer manufactured by Misto International LLC of Bethel, Connecticut,
 USA, where several applications of force to a slide pump from the user's hand
are required to pressurize the dispenser. The pressure within the dispenser
established by the user is then used to propel fluid from within the fluid
 reservoir in the form of droplets as a result of an additional force on the
dispenser from the user's hand.
 [0034]         To provide a better understanding of the first embodiment of the
disclosed invention to be shown, i.e., an embodiment of the disclosed
invention in a pump dispenser, the components of the basic construction of a
typical prior-art pump dispenser 200 with a suction cup 202 attached to its
bottom surface are shown in Figure 1.
[0035]          A description of the operation of the prior-art dispenser 200, as
well as a description of its associated force transmission, will be given below
to make it easier to explain how the first embodiment of the disclosed
invention to be shown utilizes the force exerted by the hand of the user on the
top of a pump dispenser to both dispense fluid and to re-establish or reinforce
the suction connection of the suction cup 202 at the bottom of the pump
dispenser to the surface 206 on which the dispenser rests.
                                         9

  [0036)          Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the fluid 204
 dispensed by the prior-art pump dispenser 200 may be a liquid or a flowable
  semi-solid or a gas. The fluid 204 dispensed from the pump dispenser 200
  exits the nozzle 220 as a stream, as droplets, as a mist, or as foam.
  [0037)          Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the cap 214
 shown.on the neck 215 at the top of the fluid reservoir 216 of the typical prior
 art pump dispenser 200 is, typically, able to be removably fastened to the
  neck 215 through the presence of threads interior to the cap 214 and exterior
 to the neck 215. Such threads are not shown in Figure 1. Those of ordinary
 skill in the art will also understand the basic physics associated with the
 suction connection of the suction cup 202 at the bottom of the prior-art
-dispenser 200 to the surface 206 on which the dispenser rests. Specifically,
 some downward force exerted on the dispenser 200 is transmitted to the top
 205 of the suction cup 202. This force expels air out from underneath the
 suction cup 202, thereby creating a volume of relatively low air pressure
 underneath the suction cup 202, and for this force to more effectively expel air
 out from underneath the suction cup 202 the surface 206 upon which the
 dispenser 200 rests must be a relatively hard, flat, and immobile surface such
 as a bathroom sink or a kitchen counter. Air at atmospheric pressure above
 the suction cup 202 pushes downwardly on the suction cup 202 and this
 results in the suction connection of the suction cup 202 to the surface 206
 upon which the dispenser 200 rests. As previously indicated, air will seep
 under the edge 203 of the suction cup 202. Eventually, the air pressure
 underneath the suction cup 202 will return to atmospheric pressure. Such
                                            10

return to atmospheric pressure first weakens the suction connection and then
causes the suction connection to be lost.
[0038]         To operate the prior-art pump dispenser 200 shown in Figure 1,
the user pushes downwardly on a surface at the rear portion 219 of the nozzle
220. This force causes the stem 208 to move downwardly. This downward
movement of the stem 208 is transmitted to the top 209 of the spring 210
within the spring chamber assembly 212. Since the spring chamber assembly
212 is firmly affixed to the cap 214 on the neck 215 at the top of the fluid
reservoir 216, the bottom 211 of the spring 210 encounters a resistance from
the piece 221 connecting the bottom 211 of the spring 210 with the bottom
213 of the spring chamber assembly 212. The result is that the spring 210
within the spring chamber assembly 212 is compressed. The volume within
the spring chamber assembly 212 available to contain fluid is reduced.
Because of the presence of the lower ball check valve 218, fluid 204 in the
spring chamber assembly 212 is expelled upwardly through the upper ball
check valve 222 and through the stem 208, and then dispensed into the hand
of the user through the nozzle 220. When the user releases downward
pressure on the stem 208, the stored energy within the spring 210 returns the
spring 210 to its uncompressed, relaxed state, thereby providing the stem 208
with an automatic upstroke. The volume of the spring chamber assembly 212
available to contain fluid 204 returns to its initial volume. Due to the presence
of the upper ball check valve 222, the pocket of relatively low air pressure that
has transiently formed within the spring chamber assembly 212 ultimately
causes fluid 204 within the fluid reservoir 216 to be sucked through the
opening 226 at the bottom of the fluid intake tube 224 into the spring chamber
                                         11

 assembly 212. The dispenser 200 is now ready for another downstroke to be
 applied to the stem 208.
 [0039]          The path of transmission of downward force from the user to the
top of the suction cup 202 that is associated with operation of the prior-art
 pump dispenser 200 shown in Figure 1 can be seen to be:
                  User 7stem 208      -> spring 21 Owithin spring chamber
         assembly 212-        bottom 213 of spring chamber assembly 212
         + cap 214 of fluid reservoir 216 - neck 215 of fluid reservoir
         216+ side surfaces of fluid reservoir 216+ bottom surface 217
         of fluid reservoir 216+ top 205 of suction cup 202
 [0040]           In the prior-art pump dispenser 200, the exertion of pressure on
the top 205 of the suction cup 202 is delayed after the application of force
from the user's hand to dispense fluid. Furthermore, by the time the force
from the user's hand reaches the top 205 of the suction cup 202, the pressure
exerted on the top 205 of the suction cup 202 has been significantly
attenuated with respect to the pressure that would have been exerted on the
top 205 of the suction cup 202 had the user somehow applied his or her
downward force directly to the top 205 of the suction cup 202. Users of prior
art pump dispensers, such as the prior-art dispenser 200 described through
 Figure 1, will understand that a strong, reliable suction connection to the
surface around a sink or to a kitchen counter is difficult to obtain from the
action of dispensing fluid from a pump dispenser.
[0041]           The preferred embodiment 10 of the disclosed invention is
illustrated in Figure 2. All unlabeled components are understood to have the
same names and numbers that they had in association with Figure 1.
                                            12

 [0042]        The operation of the embodiment 10 of the disclosed invention
in a pump dispenser begins the same way as that of the prior-art pump
dispenser 200 depicted in Figure 1. Specifically, an individual pushes
downwardly on a surface 219 at the rear of the nozzle 220. This downward
force goes to the top of the stem 208. The whole stem 208 is moved
downwardly. This downward movement of the stem 208 causes the top 209
of the spring 210 within the spring chamber assembly 212 to be pushed
downwardly. The bottom 211 of the spring 210 meets resistance from the
piece 221 connecting the bottom 211 of the spring 210 with the bottom 213 of
the spring chamber assembly 212. However, in contrast to the prior-art pump
dispenser 200 shown in Figure 1, according to embodiment 10 of the present
invention this resistance is not a result of the spring chamber assembly 212
being attached to the cap 214 on the neck 215 of the fluid reservoir 216.
[0043]         According to the construction of the pump dispenser 10 of the
present invention shown in Figure 2, the spring chamber assembly 212 has
been intentionally detached from the cap 214. The bottom 213 of the spring
chamber assembly 212 is resistant to movement because a pillar tube 12 is
placed underneath, and attached to, the spring chamber assembly 212. The
pillar tube 12 shown in Figure 2 takes the place of the fluid intake tube 224
used in the prior-art fluid dispenser 200 shown in Figure 1. The bottom of the
pillar tube 12 of the pump dispenser embodiment 10 is closed by the use of a
solid disk 11, and the reasons for the use of this solid disk 11 will be given
below.
[0044]         The solid disk 11 of the pillar tube 12 rests on the inside of the
bottom surface 217 of the fluid reservoir 216 prior to the user dispensing fluid
                                         13

from the pump dispenser 10. The downward movement of the pillar tube 12 is
 prevented by the bottom surface 217 of the fluid reservoir 216. This
 resistance to movement caused by the contact between the solid disk 11 of
the pillar tube 12 and the bottom surface 217 of the fluid reservoir 216 causes
the spring 210 within the spring chamber assembly 212 to be compressed.
[0045)           The remainder of the operation of the pump dispenser 10
depicted in Figure 2 is just as described with respect to the pump dispenser
200 depicted in Figure 1, except that the release of stored energy from the
spring 210 as it relaxes within the spring chamber assembly 212 is ultimately
associated with fluid 204 from the fluid reservoir 216 being sucked into the
spring chamber assembly 212 via the pillar tube 12 as opposed to being
sucked into the spring chamber assembly 212 through the fluid intake tube
224 as in the prior-art embodiment 200 shown in Figure 1. Fluid entry into the
pillar tube 12 in Figure 2 is through one or more holes 16, 18, 20, 22 formed in
the wall 13 of the pillar tube 12 as opposed to through a single opening 226 at
the lower end of fluid intake tube 224 as shown in Figure 1.
[0046)           The path of transmission of the downward force exerted by the
hand of the user to the top 205 of the suction cup 202 that is associated with
the operation of the disclosed pump dispenser embodiment 10 with increased
stability of the current invention can now be seen to be:
                 User-> stem 208-> spring 210 within spring chamber
         assembly 212-) bottom 213 of spring chamber assembly2l 2
         -  pillartube12-> bottom surface 217offluid reservoir216->
         top 205 of suction cup 202
                                         14

 [0047]         According to embodiment 10 of the disclosed invention, the
force exerted by the user is delivered from the spring chamber assembly 212
directly to the bottom surface 217 of the fluid reservoir 216 by the pillar tube
 12. The force is therefore transmitted along a straight downward vector to the
top 205 of the suction cup 202. This path for transmission of force to the top
205 of the suction cup 202 minimizes the delay in the exertion of pressure on
the top 205 of the suction cup 202 after the application of force from the user's
hand to the top of the pump dispenser 10. This path for transmission of force
to the top 205 of the suction cup 202 also causes the force exerted on the top
205 of the suction cup 202 to be minimally attenuated with respect to the force
that would have been exerted on the top 205 of the suction cup 202 had the
user somehow applied his or her force directly to the top 205 of the suction
cup 202.
 [0048)        The establishment of a suction connection by the act of starting
the dispensing of fluid with the inventive construction of the pump dispenser
10 illustrated in Figure 2 is therefore faster and stronger than the
establishment of a suction connection with the prior-art pump dispenser 200
shown in Figure 1.
[0049)          It may be observed that the pillar tube 12 shown in Figure 2
serves three major functions. First, the pillar tube 12 helps to directly transmit
the force applied by the user's hand to dispense fluid to the top 205 of the
suction cup 202. As explained above, this direct transmission of force is the
basis for the stability of the embodiment 10 during fluid dispensation. Second,
the pillar tube 12 draws fluid from the fluid reservoir 216 as the fluid intake
tube 224 of the prior-art dispenser 200 would normally do. Third, given that
                                          15

the spring chamber assembly 212 is detached from the cap 214 on the neck
 215 of the fluid reservoir 216, the pillar tube 12 helps to hold the spring
 chamber assembly 212 in position within the fluid reservoir 216.
 [0050]         A substantially cylindrical ring 24 is shown surrounding and
affixed to the outer surface of the spring chamber assembly 212 in Figure 2.
The substantially cylindrical ring 24 shown in Figure 2 ensures that the pillar
tube 12 attached to the bottom 213 of the spring chamber assembly 212 will
always be oriented in a substantially vertical direction within the fluid reservoir
216, and those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that this substantially
vertical orientation of the pillar tube 12 allows the whole bottom rim of the
pillar tube 12 to transmit force to the bottom surface 217 of the fluid reservoir
216 and therefore enables the pillar tube 12 to more effectively expel air out
from underneath the suction cup 202. The substantially cylindrical ring 24
illustrated in Figure 2 keeps the pillar tube 12 oriented in a substantially
vertical direction by preventing the entire stem 208-spring chamber assembly
212-pillar tube 12 combination from being tilted from a vertical axis. Such
tilting from a vertical axis would most likely happen when the stem 208-spring
chamber assembly 212-pillar tube 12 combination along with the cap 214
the top of which encircles the stem 208-is reconnected to the neck 215 of
the fluid reservoir 216 after having been temporarily removed from the fluid
reservoir216forthe purpose of refilling thefluid reservoir 216 with fluid 204.
[0051]          As was stated above, the bottom of the pillartube 12 in the
embodiment 1Oshown in Figure2 disclosed bythe attachment of solid disk
11. Closing the bottom of the pillar tube 12 allows for an even distribution of
the force transmitted from the bottom of the pillar tube 12 to the bottom
                                          16

surface 217 of the fluid reservoir 216 and, hence, to the top 205 of the suction
cup 202. The result is a stronger suction connection of the suction cup 202 to
the surface 206 on which the pump dispenser embodiment 10 of the present
invention rests because more air is expelled from underneath the suction cup
 202. Furthermore, this even distribution of force reduces localized stress on
the pillar tube 12, localized stress on the bottom surface 217 of the fluid
reservoir 216, and localized stress on the suction cup 202. Such reduction of
localized stress increases the service life of those respective components.
[0052]         Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the fluid
flow rate associated with the dispensation of fluid from a dispenser is in part a
function of the precise means by which fluid is drawn from the fluid reservoir
of the dispenser.
 [0053]         If the flow rate of the fluid dispensed using an embodiment of
the disclosed invention needs to be changed, other designs for the pillar tube
12 are possible.
[0054]          Figure 3A and Figure 3B illustrate two possible variations to the
design of the pillar tube 12 shown in Figure 2.
[0055]         A first variation in the design of the pillar tube 12, shown in
Figure 3A, is a pillar tube 32 that includes two mini-tubes 34, 36. The mini
tubes 34, 36 emerge at an approximately 450 downward angle from the
central portion 38 of the pillar tube 32. The open ends 40, 42 of the two mini
tubes 34, 36 provide for the entry of fluid 204 being sucked into the pillar tube
32 from the fluid reservoir 216.
[0056]         A second variation in the design of the pillar tube 12 is the pillar
tube 52 shown in Figure 3B. A fluid intake tube 54 includes an opening 56 at
                                            17

 its lower end. The solid disk 60 is attached to the bottoms of two or more
 columns 58 that are in turn attached to the outside surface of the fluid intake
tube 54. The solid disk 60 rests on the bottom surface 217 of the fluid
 reservoir 216.
 (0057]          In the variation shown in Figure 3B, each column 58 acts as a
 structural member for the transmission of downward force to the suction cup
 202 at the bottom surface of the fluid reservoir 216. The columns 58
 collectively serve the force-transmitting function of the single, larger-diameter
 pillar tube 12 shown in Figure 2. The columns 58 transmit force to the top 205
 of the suction cup 202 when the user of the pump dispenser 10 pushes down
 on the nozzle 220 and stem 208 of the dispenser 10.
 (0058]         Portions of the pillar tube structures illustrated in Figure 2,
 Figure 3A, and Figure 3B could be combined into a single pillar tube structure.
For example, a pillar tube structure could be built with holes, projecting mini
tubes beneath these holes, and attached slender columns leading down to a
solid disk with no holes. Also, it is understood that all holes shown for fluid
entry in Figure 2 and in the variations of the design of the pillar tube 12 shown
in Figure 3A and in Figure 3B can be altered considerably with regard to their
shapes, numbers, and positions.
(0059]          An increase in the force transmitted to the top 205 of the suction
cup 202 from a downward stroke on the dispenser stem 208 will likely lead to
better evacuation of the air located beneath the suction cup 202, and,
consequently, a stronger suction connection of the suction cup 202 to the
surface 206 on which the pump dispenser embodiment 10 of the current
invention is resting.
                                          18

 [0060]         If there is a need for an even stronger suction connection than
that associated with the pump dispenser 10 depicted in Figure 2, Figures 4A,
4B, 4C, and 4D illustrate four variations to the suction cup and the area on
the bottom surface 217 of the fluid reservoir 216 immediately above the
 suction cup 202 that will lead to an increase in the force transmitted to the top
 205 of the suction cup 202 from a downward stroke on the stem 208.
 [0061]        Shown in Figure 4A is a first variation for the construction of the
 bottom surface of the fluid reservoir 216. In this variation, a section of flexible
 material 72 having greater flexibility than the side walls of the fluid reservoir
 216 forms the bottom surface of the fluid reservoir 216.
 [0062]        Shown in Figure 4B is a second variation for the construction of
the bottom surface of the fluid reservoir 216. Herein, a hole 82 is formed
through the bottom surface 217 of the fluid reservoir 216. The hole 82 is
directly above the suction cup 202. The hole 82 is covered by a flexible, fluid
impermeable membrane 84 that is firmly affixed to either of the interior or the
exterior of the bottom surface 217 of the fluid reservoir 216. The top 205 of
the suction cup 202 is attached to the flexible, fluid-impermeable membrane
84. The height of the suction cup 202 may be increased so that its upper end
penetrates into the volume of the fluid reservoir 216, although the flexible,
fluid-impermeable membrane 84 will, in that case, still lie between the suction
cup 202 and the bottom of the pillar tube 12.
[0063]         In Figure 4A, the solid disk 11 of the pillar tube 12 rests on the
flexible bottom surface 72 of the fluid reservoir 216. In Figure 4B, the solid
disk 11 of the pillar tube 12 rests on the flexible membrane 84. In both of
these variations, the surface immediately above the suction cup 202 will flex
                                          19

 more than in the embodiment shown in Figure 2. This greater flexing of the
surface immediately above the suction cup 202 will result in the transmission
of more force to the top 205 of the suction cup 202 as a result of a downward
stroke of the dispenser stem 208 than would be transmitted by the area of the
 bottom surface 217 of the fluid reservoir 216 immediately above the suction
cup 202 of Figure 2.
 [0064)         A third variation for the construction of the bottom surface of the
fluid reservoir 216, shown in Figure 4C, also involves placement of a hole 82
in the region of the bottom surface 217 of the fluid reservoir 216 that is directly
above the suction cup 202. In the variation shown in Figure 4C, the top of the
suction cup 202 has a greater height than that of the suction cup shown in
Figure 2. The upper end 207 of the suction cup 202 penetrates into the fluid
reservoir 216. A washer-shaped, flexible, fluid-impermeable membrane 94 is
tightly attached to the side of the suction cup 202 to seal the hole formed in
the bottom surface of the fluid reservoir 216. The outer edge of the washer
shaped, flexible, fluid-impermeable membrane 94 is tightly affixed to either the
interior or the exterior of the bottom surface 217 of the fluid reservoir 216 that
surrounds the hole 82.
[0065)          A fourth variation for the construction of the bottom surface of
the fluid reservoir 216, shown in Figure 4D, involves the removal of the entire
bottom surface 217 of the fluid reservoir 216. The bottom surface 217 of the
fluid reservoir 216 is replaced with a large diameter suction cup 102. The
upper edge of the large diameter suction cup 102 has an upward extension
104. The upward extension 104 wraps around, and is tightly attached to, the
lower region of the outside side surface of the fluid reservoir 216.
                                           20

 [0066]         In both of the variations shown in Figure 4C and in Figure 4D,
 the solid disk 11 of the pillar tube 12 rests directly on the top 207 and 227 of
 the suction cup 202 and 102, respectively, before use of the dispenser 10.
 The top of the suction cup 202 and 102 will therefore be likely to receive
 significantly more pressure than the top 205 of the suction cup 202 of Figure 2
 will receive when the pillar tube 12 transmits a downward force from the
 user's hand.
 [0067]         In the variations described through Figures 4A - 4D, it is
 important that the length of the stem 208 situated above the cap 214 prior to
the dispensing of fluid 204 has the proper height and/or that the surface
 immediately above the suction cup 202 has the appropriate stiffness such that
 the deformation of the surface immediately above the suction cup 202 upon
 each downward stroke of the stem 208 js sufficient to achieve a strong suction
 connection and yet not much greater than is necessary to achieve a strong
 suction connection.
 [0068]         Another variation to the embodiment 10 of the disclosed
 invention in a pump dispenser is the fabrication of the solid disk 11 from a
 heavy material. Making the solid disk 11 from a heavy material enables the
effects described in the following paragraph.
 [0069]         First, each downstroke of the stem 208 will exert a greater force
on the top 205 of the suction cup 202, resulting in a stronger suction
connection of the suction cup 202 to the surface 206 on which the pump
dispenser 10 rests, since the force transmitted from the user to the top 205 of
the suction cup 202 will be combined with the force associated with the
increased weight of solid disk 11. Second, making the solid disk 11 from a
                                          21

 heavy material will lower the center of gravity of the pump dispenser 10 along
with increasing the mass of the pump dispenser. Both of these effects of this
 modification will reduce the chance of a downstroke on the stem 208 causing
the pump dispenser to tip over or to move over the surface on which the pump
dispenser rests.
 [0070]          Yet another variation to the embodiment 10 of the disclosed
invention in a pump dispenser is illustrated in Figure 5. This variation may be
applied separately or in combination with what was illustrated in Figure 3 and
in Figure 4. A first piece of ferromagnetic material 92 is either attached to the
solid disk 11 of the pillar tube 12 or is attached to the bottom of the pillar tube
 12 in lieu of a solid disk. A second piece of ferromagnetic material 94 is used
to connect the bottom surface 217 of the fluid reservoir 216 to the top 205 of
the suction cup 202. As shown in Figure 5, the two pieces of ferromagnetic
 material 92, 94 are oriented with opposite polarity. The two pieces of
ferromagnetic material 92, 94 will therefore magnetically repel each other
when the pillar tube 12 experiences a downward force during fluid
dispensation, and this magnetic repulsion will transmit a downward force to
the top 205 of the suction cup 202 that adds to the force transmitted
downwardly from the user's hand to the top 205 of the suction cup 202.
[0071]          Because ferromagnetic materials are relatively heavy, the
combined weight of the two pieces of ferromagnetic material 92, 94 will also
add to the force transmitted by the user to the top 205 of the suction cup 202
when the user pushes downwardly on the nozzle 220 and stem 208.
Furthermore, the weight of both pieces of ferromagnetic material 92, 94 will
lower the center of gravity of the pump dispenser 10 and increase its overall
                                          22

  mass, thus further reducing the chance of the dispenser turning over or
 moving over the surface on which it rests when the user begins to dispense
 fluid.
 [0072]         Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that there are
 many additional ways to link the stem at the top of a dispenser with the
 suction cup at the bottom of the dispenser so that the force exerted by the
 user on the top of the dispenser not only dispenses fluid but also re
 establishes or reinforces the suction connection of the suction cup at the
 bottom of the dispenser to the surface upon which the dispenser rests.
 [0073]         The disclosed invention can also be applied to aerosol
 dispensers, such as those used as air fresheners. This is because household
 aerosol dispensers include several of the basic structural features found in
 prior-art pump dispensers such as the one shown in Figure 1, e.g., a fluid
 outlet, a spring chamber assembly, and a fluid intake tube.
 [0074]         Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that while the
structure of aerosol dispensers has similarities to that of the prior-art pump
dispenser shown in Figure 1, the means by which fluid is expelled from an
aerosol dispenser is very different from the way fluid is expelled from a pump
dispenser. In an aerosol dispenser the fluid reservoir is pressurized with a
propellant gas. A downward stroke on the dispenser stem moves the stem
such that an open path is created between the pressurized fluid reservoir and
the outside air. Fluid is both pushed from the pressurized fluid reservoir into
the fluid intake tube and is expelled outwardly through the fluid outlet as
droplets (i.e., sprayed out) by the gas pressure within the pressurized fluid
reservoir. The change in the volume of the spring chamber assembly able to
                                          23

 contain fluid plays a relatively insignificant role in expelling fluid from within
the pressurized fluid reservoir. Also, ball check valves, such as those shown
in Figure 1, are generally not used in an aerosol dispenser.
 [0075]         Although the words "droplets" and "spray" were used in the
 preceding paragraph, it is understood that fluid expelled from an aerosol
dispenser could be dispensed as foam as well as in the form of a spray.
 [0076]         Figure 6 shows an embodiment 250 of the disclosed invention in
 an aerosol dispenser.
 [0077]        As may be seen in Figure 6, the spring chamber assembly 262
 is detached from the top surface 253 of the fluid reservoir 254.
 [0078]        A substantially cylindrical ring 260 is surrounding and affixed to
the spring chamber assembly 262 and ensures that the entire stem 256
spring chamber assembly 262-pillar tube 12 combination will always be
oriented in a substantially vertical direction within the fluid reservoir 254.
[0079]         When the hand of the user exerts a downward force on the top
251 of the aerosol dispenser 250, a path for the passage of fluid from within
the pressurized fluid reservoir 254 to the fluid outlet 264 is opened.
[0080]         The downward force from the hand of the user is transmitted to
the stem 256 and then to the bottom 263 of the spring chamber assembly
262. Then, the pillar tube 12 transmits this force to the bottom surface 255 of
the fluid reservoir 254 and the bottom surface 255 of the fluid reservoir 254
transmits this force to the top 205 of the suction cup 202. Consistent with the
structural similarities between this aerosol dispenser embodiment 250 and the
pump dispenser embodiment 10 of the disclosed invention that was shown in
Figure 2, the path for the transmission of downward force in the aerosol
                                           24

 dispenser 250 from the user to the top 205 of the suction cup 202 is seen to
 be the same as the path of transmission of downward force previously
 described for the pump dispenser 10 shown in Figure 2.
 [0081]         As will be described below, the disclosed invention can also be
applied to Misto@-type dispensers. The process of fluid dispensation for
Misto@-type dispensers is similar to that for aerosol dispensers. The key
difference between a Misto@-type dispenser and an aerosol dispenser is that
a Misto@-type dispenser does not retain a pressurized propellant gas to expel
droplets of fluid. Rather, for Misto@-type dispensers, the pressurized gas
generally used to expel droplets of fluid is air that has been mechanically
pressurized by the user prior to fluid dispensation through use of a slide pump
assembly included as a part of each Misto@-type dispenser. With this
absence of a pressurized propellant gas within a Misto@-type dispenser, the
fluid reservoir of a Misto@-type dispenser can be refilled with fluid in the same
way that pump dispensers are refilled with fluid, that is, by temporary removal
of the components that fit into the fluid reservoir of the dispenser.
 [0082]         Figure 7A and Figure 7B illustrate an embodiment 300 of the
disclosed invention in a Misto@-type dispenser. The specific shape of the
pillar tube 302 attached to the bottom 313 of the spring chamber assembly
312 and to the bottom 315 of the slide pump assembly 314 will enable
increased stability of this embodiment both during the actual dispensation of
fluid contained within the fluid reservoir 322 of the Misto@-type dispenser and
during the mechanical generation of the pressure needed to propel fluid from
the Misto@-type dispenser 300 with the slide pump assembly 314. Further
enabling the increased stability of this embodiment 300 is the use of a
                                          25

washer-shaped, flexible rubber piece 310 whose inner edge surrounds and is
 affixed to the exterior of the slide pump assembly 314 and whose outer edge
 is affixed to a substantially circular and flat ring 316 that in turn is firmly but
 removably attached to a notch 318 at the top of the fluid reservoir 322. The
 use of this washer-shaped, flexible rubber piece 310 will add to the increased
 stability of the embodiment 300 both during fluid dispensation and during
 pressure generation because the rubber piece 310 will permit more downward
force to be transmitted to the pillar tube 302 upon a downward stroke of the
 stem 324 for fluid dispensation and upon a downward stroke of the plunger
 304 of the slide pump assembly 314 for pressure generation than would be
the case if the connection between the exterior of the slide pump assembly
314 and the substantially circular and flat ring 316 were a rigid connection.
Finally, the spokes 320, which attach the spring chamber assembly 312 to the
interior of the slide pump assembly 314 and which will be recognized by those
of ordinary skill in the art as already appearing in prior-art Misto@-type
dispensers, yet further enable the increased stability of this embodiment 300
both during fluid dispensation and during pressure generation because they
ensure that the stem 324-spring chamber assembly 312-pillar tube 302
combination of the embodiment 300 is always positioned in a substantially
vertical orientation. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the
illustration of the embodiment 300 in Figure 7 omits the depiction of at least
two features that are generally found in all Misto@-type dispensers. One
feature omitted from Figure 7 is a mechanism to mix air pressurized through
use of the slide pump assembly 314 with fluid to be dispensed. A second
feature omitted from Figure 7 is a mechanism that allows the substantially
                                           26

 circular and flat ring 316 to be firmly attached to the notch 318, to prevent the
 leakage of pressurized air from in between the ring 316 and the notch 318,
and yet also allows the ring 316 to be removable from the notch 318 so that
the user is able to pull out all of the components that fit into the fluid reservoir
for the purpose of a fluid refill. The depiction of these two omitted features is
 not needed to understand the enablement of increased stability in the Misto@
type dispenser 300.
 [0083)         For dispensation of fluid from the Misto@-type dispenser 300 by
the user, force is transmitted from the user's hand at the top 301 of the
embodiment 300 to the stem 324 and is then transmitted to the bottom 313 of
the spring chamber assembly 312. This downward force is then conveyed by
the pillar tube 302 to the bottom surface 323 of the fluid reservoir 322, and the
bottom surface 323 of the fluid reservoir 322 then transmits that force to the
top 309 of the suction cup 306 that is positioned on the bottom of the Misto@
type dispenser 300.
 [0084)          Furthermore, if the user ensures that the bottom 305 of the
plunger 304 of the slide pump assembly 314 makes contact with the bottom
315 of the slide pump assembly 314 as the plunger 304 is being rapidly
moved up and down by the user to generate the pressure needed to dispense
fluid from the Misto@-type dispenser 300, then the force from the contact
between the bottom 305 of the plunger 304 and the bottom 315 of the slide
pump assembly 314 will be transmitted downwardly to the ledge 308 of the
pillar tube 302, the pillar tube 302 will _then transmit that force to the bottom
surface 323 of the fluid reservoir 322, and the bottom surface 323 of the fluid
reservoir 322 will then convey that force to the top 309 of the suction cup 306.
                                           27

 Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that increased dispenser
 stability will be more quickly attained during use of the slide pump assembly
 314 if the first movement of the plunger 304 made in the process of pressure
 generation is a downward stroke that establishes contact between the bottom
 305 of the plunger 304 and the bottom 315 of the slide pump assembly 314.
 [0085]          Application of the embodiment 300 of the disclosed invention
 may enable the manufacture of a Misto@-type air freshener dispenser that is
 both very convenient to use and safe.
 [0086]           Specifically, the fluid reservoir 322 of the dispenser 300 could be
 filled with a fragrant, propellant-free, non-toxic oil. A user could pump the
 plunger 304 of the slide pump assembly 314 two or three times with one hand
 and then, with the same hand, depress the top 301 of the dispenser 300 and
 spray out the fragrant, non-toxic oil. Application of this embodiment 300
would allow the user to keep the air freshener stationary throughout the use of
the plunger 304 and throughout the actual dispensation of the fragrant, non
toxic oil.
 [0087]           Embodiments of the disclosed invention have described the
direct transmission of fluid-dispensing force applied to a dispenser to the top
of a suction cup located on the bottom of the dispenser. It is this application
of a fluid-dispensing force that re-establishes or reinforces the suction at the
bottom of the dispenser as soon as the dispenser has begun to be used,
thereby significantly increasing dispenser stability. The disclosed invention
may be more broadly generalized to include any linking of the dispensing of
fluid with an increased stability of the dispenser, and the embodiments
presented herein could be modified as disclosed in the following paragraphs.
                                             28

 [0088)          The top of the spring within the spring chamber assembly could
be pulled down by a means other than by a simple downward motion of the
stem that is attached to the top of the spring. For example, the top of the
spring could be pulled down by the movement of an outside lever. From a
more general perspective, the word "direct" can be interpreted in a relative
sense with respect to the above description of the disclosed invention as
involving a "direct" transmission of force from a user to the top of the suction
cup of a given dispenser, i.e., the word "direct" can be taken to mean a
mechanical pathway for the transmission of force that is more direct than the
usual force transmission along the sides of the fluid reservoir of a prior-art
dispenser. Accordingly, the initial force imparted by the user to dispense fluid
could be in any direction and the exact path of force transmission from the
user to the top of the suction cup could vary among different types of
dispensers. Also, the disclosed invention should not be taken to preclude the
use of simple means for the amplification of mechanical force during the
transmission of force from the user to the top of the suction cup.
[0089)           Furthermore, the disclosed invention could be applied to those
dispensers for which a spring is not involved in dispensing fluid.
[0090)          The spring chamber assembly-plus-stem and the pillar tube
could be separated from each other, with the resulting lower and upper
portions reconnected to each other with a spring. Such reconnection of the
spring chamber assembly-plus-stem and pillar tube with a spring could be
helpful if the insertion of additional springs into the stem-spring chamber
assembly-pillar tube combination might reduce wear on the main spring within
the spring chamber assembly-plus-stem.
                                           29

 [0091]          The pillar tube could have either a narrower or wider diameter
 than the diameter of the top of the suction cup, provided that sufficient air can
 still be forced out from underneath the suction cup at the beginning of the
 dispensing of fluid. Changing the dimensions of the pillar tube may be
 necessary because the dimensions of the pillar tube may be restricted for
 reasons of cost or strength or for achievement of an adequate rate of fluid
 flow from the fluid reservoir. It is understood that a pillar tube with a relatively
narrow diameter would have to be able to withstand the compression force
associated with being repeatedly pressed toward a relatively immovable
surface at its lower end. Also, those of ordinary skill in the art will know that
even if the solid disk previously shown as closing the bottom of the pillar tube
were made to be very flat or made to be hollow, and even if the disk were
made to be hollow and the top surface of the disk were additionally removed,
the disk could still help to evenly transmit force from the bottom of the pillar
tube to the top of the suction cup. Furthermore, those of ordinary skill in the
art will understand that this disk would not be necessary in the first place if the
distribution of force transmitted from the edge of the lower end of the pillar
tube directly to the bottom surface of the fluid reservoir could be shown to
result in the application of a sufficiently well-distributed force to the top of the
suction cup, and consequently a sufficiently strong suction connection of the
suction cup to the surface on which the dispenser rests.
[0092]          The presence of the pillar tube within the fluid reservoir does not
preclude the simultaneous presence of a standard fluid intake tube placed in
its standard location, and therefore located within the pillar tube. Fluid could
flow from within the fluid reservoir into the pillar tube through its holes, be
                                           30

 drawn into the opening of the standard fluid intake tube, and then be drawn
 into the spring chamber assembly-plus-stem.
 [0093)          In both pump and aerosol dispensers, the spring chamber
 assembly does not have to be detached from the cap or from the top surface
 of the fluid reservoir if, in response to a downward force from the user's hand,
the cap or the top surface of the fluid reservoir is flexible enough to allow a
 sufficient downward movement of the spring chamber assembly and a
 corresponding sufficient transmission of force to the top of the suction cup.
 [0094)          In both pump and aerosol dispensers, the substantially cylindrical
 ring does not have to be directly affixed to the outer surface of the spring
 chamber assembly-plus-stem.         Specifically, there could be a gap between the
 substantially cylindrical ring and the spring chamber assembly-plus-stem, with
the substantially cylindrical ring possibly held in place around
the spring chamber assembly-plus-stem by spokes or by an extension arising
from the outer surface of the spring chamber assembly-plus-stem. The
substantially cylindrical ring does not have to have a perfectly circular-shaped
cross section. The substantially cylindrical ring could even be attached to a
portion of the pillar tube instead of or in addition to the spring chamber
assembly-plus-stem. The important feature of the substantially cylindrical ring
is that it has some presence at the opening of the fluid reservoir, and that its
presence keeps the stem-spring chamber assembly-pillar tube combination in
a substantially vertical orientation.
[0095)          A substantially cylindrical ring need not be used at all. Instead,
the spring chamber assembly-plus-stem and the opening at the top of the fluid
reservoir could each inherently have dimensions such that the stem-spring
                                            31

chamber assembly-pillar tube combination can only be oriented substantially
vertically whenever the stem-spring chamber assembly-pillar tube
combination is returned to the fluid reservoir after a temporary removal.
Alternatively, a relatively shallow depression could be made in the bottom
surface of the fluid reservoir so that the lower end of the pillar tube fits into the
shallow depression. Such a structure would force the stem-spring chamber
assembly-pillar tube combination to be oriented in a substantially vertical
direction. If a shallow depression is formed in the bottom surface -of the fluid
reservoir, the user would guide the pillar tube into the corresponding
depression every time the stem-spring chamber assembly-pillar tube
combination is removed and returned to the dispenser.
[0096]          Yet another alternative to the use of a substantially cylindrical
ring includes affixing the bottom of the pillar tube to the bottom surface of the
fluid reservoir or to the top of the suction cup in cases where the bottom of the
pillar tube rests directly on the suction cup prior to use of the dispenser. The
stem-spring chamber assembly-pillar tube combination could then be
designed to be separable to make it possible to remove some upper portion of
the stem-spring chamber assembly-pillar tube combination to be able to refill
the fluid reservoir.
[0097]         A design in which portions of the stem-spring chamber
assembly-pillar tube combination are able to be separated would only be
acceptable if, after the user completes a refill, rejoins the separated portions
of the stem-spring chamber assembly-pillar tube combination, and then
causes fluid to again flow upwardly within the stem-spring chamber assembly
pillar tube combination, no air is able fo leak into the stem-spring chamber
                                          32

assembly-pillar tube combination at the region at which the portions of the
stem-spring chamber assembly-pillar tube combination are able to be
separated.
 [0098)       The suction cup could be replaced with a hook-and-loop
fastener attachment system in cases where the bottom surface of the fluid
reservoir is made to be flat. In this scenario, one part of a hook-and-loop
fastener attachment system could be affixed to the location at the bottom
surface of the dispenser where the suction cup used to be and another part of
the hook-and-loop fastener attachment system could be affixed to the surface
on which the dispenser rests such that the two parts of the hook-and-loop
fastener attachment system stick to one another. Force transmitted when the
user dispenses fluid would re-establish or reinforce the connection between
the two parts of the hook-and-loop fastener attachment system and
consequently provide stability to the dispenser.
[0099)        The suction cup at the bottom surface of the fluid reservoir could
be made to be removable from the bottom surface if desired. For example,
the suction cup could be designed to fit tightly into an upwardly projecting
pocket at the bottom surface of the fluid reservoir. Such tight interfitment
would enable temporary detachment of the suction cup from the bottom
surface of the fluid reservoir as needed. Those of ordinary skill in the art will
understand that other attachments that have been described within the above
descriptions of embodiments of the disclosed invention could generally be
achieved through interfitments.
[00100)       The transmission of force could be substantially horizontal as
opposed to being substantially vertical. For example, a dispenser including
                                        33

the disclosed invention could be rotated so that fluid dispensation reinforces a
 suction connection of the suction cup of the dispenser to a wall instead of to a
 horizontal flat surface such as a bathroom sink or kitchen counter. The fluid
 reservoir of such a dispenser would probably have to have a relatively
 restricted dimension perpendicular to the plane of the wall to prevent
gravitational torque from interfering with the suction connection of the
dispenser to the wall.
 [00101]        A pump dispenser including the disclosed invention could be a
foam dispenser. Such a foam-dispensing dispenser would include a means of
 mixing air into the fluid to be dispensed and then homogenizing the resulting
foam.
 [00102]       In addition to dispensing liquids, semi-solids, or liquids mixed
within a propelling gas, a dispenser including the disclosed invention could
dispense solids, gases, solids mixed within a propelling gas, or a mixture of
solids and liquids that is mixed within a propelling gas. The dispenser could
dispense any combination of flowable fluids.
 [00103]        Application of the disclosed invention to pump dispensers would
enable the dispensing of small solids, such as ice cream sprinkles, which
could be drawn into the nozzle within a stream of air. Application of the
disclosed invention to aerosol dispensers would be appropriate for dispensing
pressurized gas in cases where no separate propellant is needed.
ADVANTAGES
[00104]         Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the direct
transmission of the force applied to dispense fluid located within the fluid
reservoir of a dispenser to the top of a suction cup that is affixed to the bottom
                                           34

of the dispenser significantly reduces the probability that the dispenser will tip
over or move across the surface on which it rests. A pump dispenser
including the disclosed invention will therefore maintain its same location from
use to use. Maintaining a pump dispenser in the same location from use to
use will decrease the probability of dispensed fluid getting underneath the
suction cup of the dispenser, which in turn will help to maintain the
effectiveness of the suction cup, and will also enable its repetitive use in low
light conditions by users with difficulty seeing.
[00105]         The disclosed invention prevents the inconvenience of a plastic
pump dispenser falling into a bathroom or kitchen sink or onto a shower floor.
Further, the disclosed invention can prevent the destruction of a breakable
dispenser and the possible danger of being injured when a glass, ceramic, or
porcelain dispenser shatters after falling onto a floor or other hard surface.
[00106]         It has also been found that the present invention enables those
individuals with a reduced reach or with reduced motor skills to avoid tipping a
fluid dispenser over or moving the dispenser to where it is not easily used.
Such individuals may include children reaching up to activate a fluid
dispenser, elderly individuals with arthritis, individuals having nerve or
muscular diseases that limit range of movement, individuals with paraplegia,
and individuals with cerebral palsy.
[00107]         The relatively large surface area of the fluid reservoir of a
dispenser can make it a repository for bacteria and viruses. Thus, those of
ordinary skill in the art will see that the disclosed invention will lead to better
hygiene because the users of a soap dispenser will no longer each have to
apply a firm downward pressure on the fluid reservoir to ensure dispenser
                                           35

 stability prior to the cleaning of their hands. Those of ordinary skill in the art
 will also see that hygiene will be improved from the significantly reduced
 chance of a dispenser falling into a sink or onto the floor.
 (00108]          Health care practitioners will particularly value the improvement
 in hygiene that will be realized from use of the disclosed invention. As they
 typically have to wash their hands numerous times each day, health care
 practitioners will also be likely to appreciate the time savings that will result
 from their no longer having to return their soap dispenser to its upright
 position or pick up their soap dispenser from the sink or from the floor.
 (00109]          Users of boats or recreational vehicles, in which surfaces do not
 remain stable, will appreciate the significantly increased hygiene and
convenience associated with a dispenser not falling into the sink or onto the
floor due to the motion of the boat or recreational vehicle.
 (00110]         The design of the fluid reservoir of prior-art fluid dispensers does
 not have to be modified to enable use of the disclosed invention, and those
 modifications to the bottom of prior-art fluid reservoirs that are associated with
some embodiments of the disclosed invention would be very straightforward
to make. Changes that would have to be made to a prior-art dispenser to
allow for use of the disclosed invention would be relatively easy to implement.
The pillar tube and substantially cylindrical ring could likely be made from
inexpensive recyclable plastic. The reduction of the tendency of a plastic
dispenser to fall down during use would allow manufacturers to make fluid
reservoirs with plastic that is less robust than the plastic that is normally used
to add weight to a dispenser for stability. The opportunity to reduce the
amount of plastic used to manufacture a particular line of pump dispensers
                                           36

will save money for manufacturers and will benefit the environment as well by
 reducing the amount of energy used for the production of those plastic
 dispensers.
 [00111]         If a downward stroke applied to a dispenser will cause the
dispenser to produce a light, a sound such as music, or a verbal message
when dispensing fluid, then the dispenser will need a pressure- or movement
sensitive element to activate the light, sound, or verbal message. Through
use of the disclosed invention, a pressure- or movement-sensitive element
could be positioned in between the suction cup and the bottom surface of the
dispenser and the force transmitted to the top of the suction cup when the
user pushes on the top of the dispenser to dispense fluid could be used to
activate this element. With this positioning of a pressure- or movement
sensitive element, the possibility of the element malfunctioning from exposure
to fluid will be reduced.
[00112]          If the fluid reservoir of a dispenser and the fluid that it contains
are transparent or translucent, then the pillar tube will always be visible to the
user of a dispenser that includes the disclosed invention. In such a case, the
pillar tube could be made to have some decorative appeal. Those of ordinary
skill in the art can see that the decorative appeal of the pillar tube could be
achieved through constructing the pillar tube with a pleasant color pattern or
with an interesting overall shape, such as a pillar from classical architecture, a
rocket, a character that children like, and so on. The decorative appeal of the
pillar tube might also include bubbles that emerge out of the holes in the pillar
tube.

disclosure. Such additional embodiments shall fall within the scope and
meaning of the appended claims and their legal equivalents.
