                                               FIELD
 5 [00011        Aspects of the present invention relate to a method in connection with a
   radiosonde. In particular, aspects of the invention relate to error compensation for humidity
   measurement in a radiosonde. Further, aspects of the invention relate to a system
   comprising a radiosonde and a ground station. Furthermore, aspects of the invention relate
   to a computer readable medium having stored thereon a set of computer implementable
10 instructions. Additionally, aspects of the invention relate to a computer program.
                                           BACKGROUND
   [0002]        A radiosonde is a weather observation device, which is attached to a gas
   balloon, measures atmospheric parameters, and sends the measurement information
15 typically to a ground station. Measured or calculated parameters typically include ambient
   temperature, pressure, and humidity, as well wind speed and direction, at various altitudes.
   [0003]         The radiosonde is carried upwards through the atmosphere by a gas balloon,
   whereby the atmosphere to be measured and also the environmental conditions of the
   measurement arrangement change dynamically. Certain embodiments of the invention are
20 also suitable for dropsondes. A dropsonde is a weather observation device like a
   radiosonde, but instead of being lifted by a gas balloon it is dropped from an airborne
   system, typically an aircraft, Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), or a driftballoon.
   [0004]         Meteorological   measurements      are performed     by the   sensors   of the
   radiosonde. The atmospheric profile obtained by a radiosonde is particularly important as
25 input for numerical weather forecasting models and climate research. There are also
   military radiosonde applications e.g. for weather forecasting and ballistic preparation.
   [0005]        Document US 7,358,862 B2 discloses, for example, a radiosonde system, a
   radiosonde system receiver and a signal processing method for use in a radiosonde system.
   The radiosonde system comprises at least one radiosonde with means for acquisition of

                                                 2
   position and/or weather data and means for downstream transmission of the data over a
   radio-frequency path, signal capture means for reception of the weather and/or position
   data, and receiver means for processing the received signals.
   [0006]        One of the key parameters to be measured by radiosondes is the water vapour
 5 concentration, measured either as relative humidity, or as dew point temperature. One of
   the objectives of this humidity measurement is, for example, detection of clouds and their
   altitude. Typically, the temperature range during the measurement cycle is very large and
   may be, for example, in the range between +40 ['C] and -80 ['C].
   [00071        The measurements may be complicated by, inter alia, the large range of each
10 measured variable, and rain, temperature, freezing, condensation, and oversaturation.
   Measuring errors may also be caused by slowness of the radiosonde sensors, and by
   radiative heat exchange occurring in the atmosphere.
   [0008]        Recent developments      in climate    research and in traditional weather
   forecasting have set even more strict accuracy requirements for humidity measurements.
15 Low temperature combined with low water vapour concentration in the stratosphere, or
   high water vapour concentration in the upper troposphere make the measuring environment
   extremely challenging. Humidity also varies quickly in relation to time and altitude.
   [0009]        Document US 2008/0072669 Al describes a method for correcting humidity
   measurement results of a radiosonde for errors resulting from radiative heat exchange.
20 Humidity is measured by the humidity sensor in the radiosonde. An error correction table
   or function is used to estimate the error caused by radiative heat exchange as a function of
   one or more parameters affecting sensor heat balance, such as solar radiation intensity,
   solar elevation angle, balloon ascent rate, and air density. Alternatively, a correction table
   or correction function is used to estimate the temperature of the humidity sensor, and a
25 corrected humidity value is calculated based on both the measured humidity and the
   estimated humidity sensor temperature.
   [0010]         Document WO 2014/128348 Al discloses a method and a radiosonde.
   According to the method, at least temperature and relative humidity of the atmosphere are
   measured by a radiosonde. The humidity measurement is performed continuously in an
30 elevated temperature in order to make the measurement faster, and both the elevated
   temperature and the ambient air temperature are measured simultaneously. These three

                                                 3
   measurements are used to determine the corrected atmospheric humidity. This method
   eliminates the need for radiation error correction presented in document US 2008/0072669
   Al.
   [0011]         In radiosondes the most commonly used humidity sensor type is a capacitive
 5 thin film sensor. The signal of a capacitive humidity sensors changes as water is absorbed
   into the insulating polymer film changing the permittivity of the polymer. The amount of
   water absorbed is approximately proportional to the relative humidity at the temperature of
   the sensor, i.e., to the proportion of the partial pressure of water vapor to the sensor
   temperature dependent saturation vapor pressure. In a molecular scale, the amount of water
10 absorbed into the polymer depends on the amount of suitable binding sites available for
   water molecules which depends also on the amount of other gases absorbed into the
   polymer. Therefore, at a given partial pressure of water vapor, water absorption into a
   given polymer is dependent on sensor temperature, gas pressure, and gas composition. In
   the rest of this document, the error caused by ignoring some of the dependencies is called
15 absorption model error.
   [0012]         As part of the radiosonde manufacturing process each radiosonde sensor is
   individually characterized     for measurement      errors. For cost reasons,    the   error
   characterization is typically made near normal pressure, i.e. 1013.15 [hPa], at different
   temperatures. Due to the characterization conditions the absorption model error is typically
20 reduced to an insignificant level at the relevant temperature range near normal pressure.
   Furthermore, in air at room temperature the absorption model error is typically
   insignificantly small at pressure range from normal pressure to full vacuum. This explains
   why the absorption model error of humidity measurement has been undetected in
   radiosondes.
25 [0013]         However, measurements in low pressure conditions indicate that the
   absorption model error of a capacitive polymer based sensors grows rapidly at low
   temperatures, becoming noticeable below -20 ['C] and significant at the lower end of
   radiosonde temperature range at between about -60 ['C] and -80 ['C]. Corrections larger
   than 0.5 [% RH] can be considered relevant in radiosounding data.
30 [0014]         Carrying out individual radiosonde error characterization for the humidity
   measurement at low pressures and temperatures is however extremely time consuming and
   expensive.

                                                  4
   [0015]         Therefore, there is need for an error compensation for humidity measurement
   which takes in account the low pressure and temperature encountered during sounding.
                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

   [0020]         According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
   system comprising a radiosonde and a ground station, and wherein the radiosonde
10 comprises means for measuring a relative humidity, the radiosonde comprises means for

   corresponding to a feature from the preceding bulleted list laid out in connection with the
20 first aspect.
   [0022]         According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a

   the humidity value decreases when pressure decreases.
   [0023]         Various embodiments of the third aspect may comprise at least one feature
   corresponding to a feature from the preceding bulleted list laid out in connection with the

                                                  7
   [00241        According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a

   [0026]         Considerable advantages are obtained by means of the embodiments of the
   invention. Certain embodiments of the invention provide a method and system for
   correcting the humidity measurement results of a radiosonde. The measured humidity
10 value can be compensated with a function depending on measured humidity, humidity
   sensor temperature and pressure.
   [00271         The needed absorption model error compensation is a material property of
   the polymer material used in the humidity sensor. The measured relative humidity can be
   compensated with a standard function that does not depend on measurements carried out
15 for individual radiosondes at low pressure and low temperature.
   [0028]         The measurement errors caused by absorption model error are large, up to 10
   [% RH] at -80 [ 0 C]. As conditions during sounding are variable, the introduction of
   explicit absorption model error compensation improves measurement accuracy and
   consistency.    Frequently   occurring   erroneous  oversaturation   humidity readings   in
20 tropopause on tropic latitude can be eliminated by using this compensation. Some
   persistent errors such as high bias after tropopause are also explained by this phenomenon
   and can be eliminated as well.

                                         EMBODIMENTS
   [0034]        Certain embodiments of the present invention relate to a method in
10 connection with a radiosonde, which method comprises steps for measuring at least
   pressure and humidity of the atmosphere at several altitudes, measuring or estimating a
   temperature of the humidity sensor, and measuring relative humidity by a capacitor having
   a polymer insulator, and wherein the relative humidity value is corrected based on a
   correction factor, which is a function of pressure, humidity sensor temperature and relative
15 humidity such that the humidity value decreases when pressure decreases. By means of the
   embodiments of the invention, error caused by low pressure and low temperature can be
   corrected.
   [00351        In FIGURE 1 a flow chart of the method according to an embodiment of the
   present invention is illustrated. The method in connection with a radiosonde comprises
20 measuring a humidity of the atmosphere at several different altitudes in the atmosphere.
   Further, the method comprises measuring a pressure at several different altitudes in the
   atmosphere. Alternatively, the pressure may be estimated from an altitude of the
   radiosonde. For example, the pressure may be calculated from an altitude (i.e. a height) of
   the radiosonde obtained from GPS or other satellite navigation system. Furthermore, the
25 method comprises measuring or estimating a temperature of a humidity sensor.
   Additionally, the method comprises measuring a relative humidity by a capacitor with a
   polymer insulator. According to the method, a correction factor is determined based at
   least partly or only on the pressure, the humidity sensor temperature, and the relative
   humidity. Correcting the relative humidity value is performed based on the correction
30 factor such that the humidity value decreases when pressure decreases. The obtained

                                                  9
   corrected humidity value may be used either directly in the radiosonde or may be
   communicated to a ground station where it is used.
   [00361        According to a certain embodiment, a volume resistivity of the polymer used
   is advantageously in a range between 1.0*106 [Ohm/m] and 1.0*1018 [Ohm/m], a relative
 5 permittivity of the polymer used is advantageously in a range between 2 and 6, and a
   relative change of the sensor capacitance is in a range between 5 [%] and 50 [%] as the
   sensor is exposed to a step change of relative humidity from 0 [RH%] to 100 [RH%].
   [00371        In FIGURE 2 a flow chart of the method according to another embodiment of
   the present invention is illustrated. After launching a radiosonde, at least a humidity of the
10 atmosphere and a humidity sensor temperature are measured at several different altitudes
   in the atmosphere. Additionally, a pressure is measured at several different altitudes in the
   atmosphere or calculated from an altitude of the radiosonde. In the latter case, the pressure
   may be considered as GPS-altitude derived pressure. Further, the relative humidity is
   measured by a capacitor having a polymer insulator. Subsequently, the measurement
15 results are transmitted to a ground station and the relative humidity value correction is
   made for the signal received at the ground station.
   [00381        According to certain embodiments, post processing of radiosounding data
   may take place by using a computing device such as a regular workstation computer.
   Generally, processing of data may be also performed for archived data.
20 [0039]        In FIGURE 3 a flow chart of the method according to an embodiment of the
   present invention is illustrated. The method in connection with a radiosonde comprises
   measuring a humidity of the atmosphere at several different altitudes in the atmosphere.
   Further, the method comprises measuring a pressure at several different altitudes in the
   atmosphere. Alternatively, the pressure may be estimated from an altitude of the
25 radiosonde. For example, the pressure may be calculated from an altitude of the radiosonde
   obtained from GPS or other satellite navigation system. Furthermore, the method
   comprises measuring or estimating a temperature of a humidity sensor. Additionally, the
   method comprises measuring a relative humidity by a capacitor with a polymer insulator.
   The relative humidity value          (RH) is corrected      based on a correction factor
30 (RHcorrection), which is a function of pressure, humidity sensor temperature, and relative
   humidity, such that the humidity value decreases when pressure decreases.

   [00401           The correction is based on the following formulas:
            RH final    =  RH - RHcorrection(P,T,RH)

            RH is measured relative humidity before correction [%]
            RHcorrection is correction for pressure and temperature induced error [%]
            P is pressure [hPa]
            PO is normal air pressure, i.e. 10 13,2 [hPa]
10          T is estimated or measured humidity sensor temperature ['C]
            Cik and   bi are polymer-specific parameters, with indices i and k running from 0 to
            3, determined through measurements against calibrated references.
   [0041]          According to certain embodiments, the correction formulas given above can
   be modified for dewpoint for polymer sensors with dewpoint calibration using laws of
15 physics.
   [0042]           Correction takes place at a pressure below normal air pressure. Correction of
   the relative humidity value (RH) may take place in the radiosonde or at a ground station
   after transmitting the measurement results to the ground station. Typically, at least one of
   the radiosonde and the ground station comprises a computer readable medium having
20 stored thereon a set of computer implementable instructions capable of causing a
   processor, in connection with the radiosonde or the ground station, to correct the measured
   relative humidity value. Alternatively, post processing of data may take place by a
   computing device.

25 at different altitudes is illustrated. In the diagram the temperature, the measured relative
   humidity, the corrected relative humidity, and the difference between the measured relative
   humidity and the corrected relative humidity are shown. It can be clearly seen that a
   maximum measurement error occurs in the range between 16000 [m] and 18000 [m] above
   the sea level.
