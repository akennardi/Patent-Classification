        The disclosure provides multimeric oligonucleotide compounds, comprising two or
more target- specific oligonucleotides (e.g., antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)), each being
resistant to cleavage, and linked together by a cleavable linker. In particular, two or more
linked target- specific oligonucleotides, each to a different target, allows concomitant
inhibition of multiple genes' expression levels, while exhibiting favorable pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic properties. Methods of making and uses of the described compounds
are also provided.

                     MULTIMERIC OLIGONUCLEOTIDE COMPOUNDS
                                     RELATED APPLICATION
         [0001]    This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119 to U.S. provisional
patent application, U.S.S.N. 61/534,561, filed September 14, 2011, entitled "Multimeric
Antisense Oligonucleotides," the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
This is a divisional of Australian patent application No. 2012308320, the entire contents of
which are incorporated herein by reference.
                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         [0002]    This invention relates to oligonucleotide reagents, oligonucleotide therapeutics,
and methods of making and using thereof.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
         [0003]    The development of oligonucleotides into clinical medicines and their use as
basic research tools is an ongoing endeavor. For example, the use of antisense oligonucleotides
for gene silencing was described as early as 1978. Since this time other oligonucleotide based
approaches have emerged for regulating gene expression, including RNA interference,
microRNAs, and, recently, targeted inhibition or inactivation of long non-coding RNAs.
         [0004]    Although natural phosphodiester-backbone oligonucleotides are taken up by
cells efficiently, they are highly susceptible to nuclease degradation in plasma, which limits their
effectiveness as therapeutics in some cases. In some instances, therefore, it is advantageous to
limit or control the extent to which oligonucleotides are degraded by nucleases. In this regard, a
number of modified nucleotides (e.g., LNAs) and backbone modifications (e.g.,
phosphorothioates, methylphosphonates) have been reported that improve stability in some
instances. Nonetheless, it remains as current objective in oligonucleotide based research and
development to obtain oligonucleotides having favorable pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic properties.
                                 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
         [0005]    According to some aspects of the invention, multimeric oligonucleotide
compounds are provided that are useful for regulating gene expression and function. Some

     WO 2013/040429                                                            PCT/US2012/055535
aspects of the invention are based on the discovery that relatively high levels of a monomeric
oligonucleotides can be achieved in a target tissue or cell when monomeric units are connected
by a cleavable linker (e.g., an endonuclease-sensitive linker) and administered as a multimer. In
some embodiments, the properties of a linker are selected to modulate the pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic properties of the multimeric oligonucleotide compounds. For example, in
some embodiments, linker properties can be tuned to control the extent to which monomeric
units are released in a particular tissue-type or cell-type to be targeted.
         [0006]   In some embodiments, an advantage of using multimers is that it allows
simultaneous knockdown of multiple targets, while exploiting the pharmacokinetic and/or
pharmacodynamic advantages of the administered oligonucleotide. In some embodiments, a
sequence-specific concomitant knockdown of two or more targets may be achieved with a
heteromultimer containing targeting oligonucleotides directed against several target gene
combinations.
         [0007]   In some embodiments, multimeric oligonucleotides compounds provided herein
comprise two or more targeting oligonucleotides linked together by a cleavable linker. In some
embodiments, each targeting oligonucleotide has a region complementary to a target region of a
genomic target sequence. In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotides hybridize to a
target nucleic acid encoded by a genomic target sequence and inhibit the function and/or effect
degradation of the target nucleic acid. The target nucleic acid may be, for example, a long non
coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA, or mRNA.
         [0008]   In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotide is an antisense
oligonucleotide (ASO), siRNA (e.g., a single stranded siRNA), miRNA sponge, or anti
microRNA antisense oligonucleotide (AMO). In some embodiments, the targeting
oligonucleotide binds specifically to a target nucleic acid in a cell and brings about degradation
of the target nucleic acid. In some embodiments, the degradation is mediated by RNAse H. In
some embodiments, the degradation is mediated by an RNAi pathway. In some embodiments,
the targeting oligonucleotide binds specifically to its target nucleic acid in a cell and inhibits the
function of the target nucleic acid. For example, in some embodiments, the targeting
oligonucleotide binds to a target lncRNA and inhibits interaction of the IncRNA with one or
more interacting proteins (e.g., a subunit of Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2)).
         [0009]   According to some aspects of the invention, compounds are provided that
comprise the general formula: X-L-[X-L];-X, in which i is an integer from 0 to 9, the value of
which indicates the number of units of [X-L]; present in the compound, in which each X is

         [0029]    In some embodiments, multimeric oligonucleotide compounds are provided that
comprise two or more targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs), each having a nuclease-resistant
modified backbone, wherein the targeting oligonucleotides are linked to each other by one or
more degradable linkers. In some embodiments, the backbone contains inter-nucleoside
linkages. In some embodiments, the individual linked targeting oligonucleotides, contained in a
compound, may be directed to the same target, or to multiple targets. The multimeric
compounds can be homodimers, homotrimers, etc., heterodimers, heterotrimers, etc. They can
be linear, branched, or circular.
         [0030]    In some embodiments, the invention is based, in part, on the discovery that
multimeric oligonucleotide compounds (e.g., a 14-mer ASO linked to another 14-mer ASO)
show significantly higher levels of the corresponding monomeric oligonucleotide compounds in
the liver when the monomer units are connected by a rapidly degradable linker (e.g., a nuclease
sensitive linker or a disulfide linker), as opposed to a linker that is nuclease-resistant and,
therefore, slowly degradable. Unexpectedly, the detected liver levels of the dimer-derived
monomeric units were five to ten times higher than that of the corresponding monomers
administered in the monomeric form. The increased delivery to the liver was also associated
with a more effective target mRNA knockdown after 14 days of dosing in mice. The invention is
therefore, in part, based on the realization that the type and properties of the linker can thus be
used to modulate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the dimer antisense
molecules. In some embodiments, rapidly degradable linkers are referred as "cleavable" (such

as, e.g., a nuclease-sensitive, phosphodiester, linkage or a linker comprising a disulfide bond),
while more stable linkages, such as, e.g., nuclease-resistant phosphorothioates, as referred to as
"noncleavable."

targets ASOs are directed to hepatic targets, including but not limited to ApoC3 and ApoB.
          [0032]   In some embodiments, targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs) contain 12 to 16
nucleotide bases, wherein one or more targeting oligonucleotides are gapmers. Targeting
oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs), including gapmers, can comprise a 2' modification in the sugar
residues (e.g., locked-nucleic acid (LNA) modification), 2'-O-methyl and 2'-fluoro
modification, and/or a nucleotide modification such as G-clamp, 5-propynyl, and 5-octadienyl
pyrimidine.
          [0033]   The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, comprising
compounds of the invention along with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. In certain
embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is characterized by one or more of the following
properties when administered in vivo:
          (a)    increased concentration in the liver and reduced clearance by kidneys as
compared to respective monomeric targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs);
          (b)    longer duration of target knockdown as compared to respective monomeric
targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs); and
          (c)    lower effective concentrations as compared to respective monomeric targeting
oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs) and/or the same multimeric oligonucleotide compound, wherein
the cleavable linker is substituted with a noncleavable linker.
          [0034]   The invention further provides methods of inhibiting mRNA levels of one or
more targets, comprising administering to a cell or a subject the compound of the invention in an
amount effective to inhibit the expression of the target(s). In some embodiments, the methods
provide a therapeutically effective knockdown of the target(s) persists for two weeks or longer
following the administration. The method can be used with targets that are associated with a
metabolic disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other conditions.

                            BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES
        [0036]   Figure 1A shows a schematic representation of an exemplary construct, in
which two 14-mer gapmers (e.g., 3LNA-8DNA-3LNA as illustrated) are connected via a linker
(represented light shaded circles). Figure 1B shows examples of various configurations of
dimers and multimers (homopolymers or heteropolymers). Figures IC and iD show details of
the chemical structures of certain multimeric ASOs.
        [0037]   Figure 2 demonstrates in vitro stability of dimers in plasmas and their
degradation in liver homogenates, as determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LC-MS). Figures 2A and 2B demonstrate slow degradation of both ApoC3 ASO monomer
(SEQ ID NO: 1, designated as per Example 2(E)) and cleavable ApoC3-ApoC3 ASO dimers
(SEQ ID NO:2 and SEQ ID NO:4) in murine and monkey plasmas respectively. Figure 2C
demonstrates efficient cleavage into monomers of the cleavable ApoC3-ApoC3 ASO dimers
(SEQ ID NO:2 and SEQ ID NO:4) and the relative stability ApoC3 ASO monomer (SEQ ID
NO: 1) in mouse liver homogenate. Figure 2D shows cleavable SEQ ID NO: 18) and
noncleavable SEQ ID NO: 19) ApoB-ApoB ASO homodimers incubated in murine plasma or
liver homogenate, demonstrating stability of both types of molecules in plasma, and a more
efficient cleavage into monomers of the cleavable version in the liver homogenate.
        [0038]   Figure 3 addresses various aspects of linker designs in homodimers. For the
results shown in Figures 3A, 3B and 3D, Hep3B cells were treated at various concentrations
(0.001, 0.006, 0.03, 0.2, 0.8, 4.0, 20 and 100 nM) of the indicated oligonucleotides formulated
with a lipotransfection agent. mRNA content and cell viability was determined 48 hours after
treatment. For the results shown in Figures 3C and 3E - 3K, Hep3B cells were treated at eight
concentrations (0.1, 0.6, 3.0, 20, 80, 400, 2000 and 10,000 nM) of the indicated oligonucleotides
without any transfection agent ("gymnotic delivery"). mRNA content and cell viability were
determined after 8 days of treatment. In all cases, the graphs depict percentage effect relative to
a non-specific oligonucleotide (negative control).
        [0039]   Figure 4 addresses various aspects of the design of various heterodimers (di
and trimers). For the results shown in Figure 4A, Hep3B cells were treated at various
concentrations (0.001, 0.006, 0.03, 0.2, 0.8, 4.0, 20 and 100 nM) of the indicated
oligonucleotides formulated with a lipotransfection agent. mRNA content and cell viability were

determined 48 hours after treatment. For the results shown in Figures 4B-4M, Hep3B cells were
treated at eight concentrations (0.1, 0.6, 3.0, 20, 80, 400, 2000 and 10,000 nM) of the indicated
oligonucleotides without any transfection agent ("gymnotic delivery"). mRNA content and cell
viability were determined after 8 days of treatment. In all cases, the graphs depict percentage
effect relative to a non-specific oligonucleotide (negative control).
         [0040]   Figures 5A-5C demonstrate that under the conditions tested, the time course of
knock-down depended on the type of linker used to connect the two antisense moieties in the
dimeric ASOs. Human ApoC3 transgenic mice were administered a single subcutaneous dose of
homodimers SEQ ID NO:5 or 3 (which are disulphide-linked homodimers of the same
monomer) at 10 mg/kg, or vehicle. Figure 5A demonstrates an associated increased reduction of
the liver ApoC3 mRNA levels in human ApoC3 transgenic mice following treatment with the
endonuclease-sensitive, phosphodiester-linked, homodimers (SEQ ID NO:4 and SEQ ID NO:2).
Homodimers SEQ ID NO:4 and 2 exhibited an increased reduction of liver ApoC3 mRNA
levels compared to the monomer (SEQ ID NO: 1) after 14 days.
         [0041]   Figures 5B and 5C show ApoC3 protein knockdown 7 days (Figure 5B) and
14 days (Figure 5C) after a single 10 mg/kg dose of the SEQ ID NO: 1 monomer and dimeric
LNA gapmers SEQ ID NO:2 - SEQ ID NO:5 in human ApoC3 transgenic mice. The figures
demonstrate increased duration in the reduction of serum ApoC3 protein levels in human ApoC3
transgenic mice following treatment with the endonuclease-sensitive phosphodiester-linked
homodimers, SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:4 and SEQ ID NO:2. Homodimers SEQ ID NO:4 and
SEQ ID NO:2 exhibited a reduction of serum ApoC3 levels similar to monomer SEQ ID NO: 1
after 7 days, but in contrast to the monomer, the reduction the reduction in target gene
expression in cells treated with the cleavable dimers (SEQ ID NO:2 or 4) was sustained and, as a
result, increased compared to SEQ ID NO: 1 after 14 days.
         [0042]   Figures 6A-6C show illustrative LC-MS results for samples extracted from
liver for the following ASOs respectively SEQ ID NO:2 (Figure 6A), SEQ ID NO:3 (Figure
6B), and SEQ ID NO:4 (Figure 6C). "IS" designates an internal standard.
         [0043]   Figures 7A and 7B illustrate that SEQ ID NO: 21, an ApoC3/ApoB
heterodimer ASO with an endonuclease sensitive phosphodiester linker, significantly down
regulated liver expression of both target mRNAs [i.e, human APOC3 (Figure 7A) and mouse
ApoB (Figure 7B)].

decreased miR-122 (10mg/kg dose, mouse liver).
          [0050]   Figures 14A and 14B illustrate that dimer oligonucleotides significantly
decreased miR-122 (50mg/kg dose, mouse liver).
          [0051]   Figures 15 illustrates that dimer oligonucleotides are ~ 5x more active than
monomer (in vivo 7d study).

decreased Malat-1 IncRNA expression.

                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
          [0054]   Multimeric oligonucleotide compounds are provided that are useful for
regulating gene expression and/or function. In general, the multimeric oligonucleotides
compounds provided herein comprise two or more targeting oligonucleotides linked together by
a cleavable linker. The multimeric oligonucleotides are useful for regulating the expression or
function of a wide range of target nucleic acids including, for example, a long non-coding RNA

      WO 2013/040429                                                             PCT/US2012/055535
(incRNA), microRNA, or mRNA. In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotide of the
multimer is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), siRNA (e.g., a single stranded siRNA), miRNA
sponge, or anti-microRNA antisense oligonucleotide (AMO). However, other types of targeting
oligonucleotides may be used.
          A. General structure of multimeric oligonucleotides
          [0055]     Multimeric oligonucleotide compounds are provided that comprise the general
formula: X-L-[X-L];-X, in which i is an integer, the value of which indicates the number of units
of [X-L]; present in the compound, and in which each X is a targeting oligonucleotide and each
L is a linker that links at least two Xs and that is more susceptible to cleavage in a mammalian
extract than each X. In some embodiments, i is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more,
          [0056]     As used herein, the term "mammalian extract" refers to a sample extracted from
a mammalian tissue, cell or subcellular compartment (e.g., an endosome). Generally, a
mammalian extract comprises one or more biomolecules (e.g., enzymes) from the tissue, cell or
subcellular compartment. In some embodiments, a mammalian extract comprises one or more
of a nuclease, peptidase, protease, phosphatase, oxidase, and reductase. The mammalian extract
may be an extract from any tissue, including, for example, kidney, liver, intestinal or tumor
tissue. The mammalian extract may be a cell extract or an extract from a subcellular component,
such as a nuclear extract, or an endosomal extract.
          [0057]     As used herein, the term "cleavage" refers to the the breaking of one or more
chemical bonds in a relatively large molecule in a manner that produces two or more relatively
small molecules. Cleavage in the mammalian extract may be mediated by a nuclease, peptidase,
protease, phosphatase, oxidase, or reductase, for example. In some embodiments, the term
"cleavable," as used herein, refers to rapidly degradable linkers, such as, e.g., phosphodiester
and disulfides, while the term "noncleavable" refer to more stable linkages, such as, e.g.,
nuclease-resistant phosphorothioates (e.g., a racemic mixture of Sp and Rp diastereoisomers, as
used in the Examples below, or a backbone enriched in Sp form). The properties of cleavable
and noncleavable linkers are described in further detail herein.
          [0058]     In one example, the compound has the following general formula:
   X - L - [X - L];- X
       X,       X,
  [X Li        [L  -  X],  . In this formula, i is an integer indicating the number of
                                                                                       units of [X-L];
present in the compound; j and k are independently 0 or 1, the value of which indicates,
respectively, the number of Xj and Xk present in the compound; and 1 and m are integers the
                                                      13

       WO 2013/040429                                                                PCT/US2012/055535
value of which indicate, respectively, the number of units of [X-L], and [L-X]m present in the
compound. In some embodiments, i is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20 or more. In certain
embodiments, 1 and m are independently 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20 or more. In certain
embodiments, at least one of [X-L], and [L-X]m are present in the compound. In some
embodiments, i, j, k, 1, and m are 0. In some embodiments, i is 1, and j, k, 1, and m are 0.
          [0059]   In one example, the compound may have the following general formula:
  X  - L -{   - Lj,- X
                          , in which i is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more.
          [0060]   In another example, the compound may have the following general formula:
  X - L - [X - L]. - X
       X
                          ,inwhich i is0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more.
          [0061]   In another example, the compound may have the following general formula:
  X -L -[X - L L -. X
                       , in which j and k are independently 0 or 1, the value of which indicates,
respectively, the number of Xj and Xk present, and at least one of Xj and Xk are present in the
compound.
          [0062]   Typically, the targeting oligonucleotide has a region of complementarity
comprising at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 15,
or at least 20 contiguous nucleotides complementary to a target region of a genomic target
sequence. The targeting oligonucleotide may have a region of complementarity comprising 4,
5, 6,7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31,
32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 45, or 50 contiguous nucleotides complementary to a target
region of a genomic target sequence. It should be appreciated that, in some embodiments, the
region of complementary may have one or more mismatches compared with the nucleotide
sequence of the target region provided that the targeting oligonucleotide is still capable of
hybridizing with the target region. In some embodiments, the region of complementary has no
mismatches compared with the nucleotide sequence of the target region. It should also be
appreciated that a targeting oligonucleotide may hybridize with a target region through Watson
Crick base pairing, Hoogsteen base pairing, reverse-Hoogsteen binding, or other binding
mechanism. In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotide is an aptamer, e.g., an aptamer
that binds to an intracellular or nuclear protein.
          [0063]   In some multimeric oligonucleotides, for two Xs, a first X and a second X, that
are separated by a single L, the 5'-end of the target region complementary to the first X and the
                                                       14

     WO 2013/040429                                                                PCT/US2012/055535
3'-end of the target region complementary to the second X are not within a distance of 0 to 1, 0
to 2, 0 to 3, 0 to 4, 0 to 5, 0 to 10, 0 to 15, 0 to 20, 0 to 25, 0 to 50, nucleotides in the genomic
target sequence when the target regions complementary to the first X and second X do not
overlap in the genomic target sequence. In some instances the different X's have
complementarity to the same target and in other instances to different target. When the X's have
complementarity to the same target the nucleic acid sequence of the X's may be identical with
one another or overlapping or completely distinct.
         [0064]    In some embodiments, multimeric oligonucleotide compounds comprises
ASOs. The invention provides in some embodiments multimeric oligonucleotide compounds,
comprising two or more target-specific antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), each ASO having a
nuclease-resistant modified backbone, in which the targeting oligonucleotides are linked to each
other by one or more degradable linkers. The term "monomeric" or "monomer," in the context
of targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs), refers to an targeting oligonucleotide that (i) is
directed to a single site or a single contiguous stretch of nucleotides on a target and (ii) is not
covalently linked to the another targeting oligonucleotide directed to the same or another site on
the same or another target. Multimeric oligonucleotide compounds are not monomeric because
they contain targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs) that are covalently linked to each other.
         [0065]    The number of targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs) in a multimeric
oligonucleotide compound of the invention may be two or more, three or more, four or more,
etc. For example, a multimeric oligonucleotide compound may contain 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
or more individual Targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs) directed to one or more targets. The
individual Targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs) can be specific to the same or different
targets. For example, as illustrated in Figure 1A, in some embodiments, the targeting
oligonucleotide is a dimer comprising two targeting oligonucleotides specific to the same target,
or a dimer comprising two targeting oligonucleotides specific to two different targets, or
alternatively, a trimer comprising three targeting oligonucleotides specific to the same target, or
a trimer comprising three targeting oligonucleotides specific three different targets, etc. In some
cases, the individual targeting oligonucleotides can be specific to the same target, yet directed to
distinct target sites on the target, such as two sites on the target sequence that are separated by at
least 10, 20, 50, 100, 300 or more nucleotides. In some embodiments, the target sites can be
directly adjacent to each other and not separated by any intervening sequences.
         [0066]    As shown in Figure 1B, the multimers can be linear or branched or a
combination thereof. For example, two ASO may be connected head-to-tail (5'-to-3'-linear)
                                                     15

      WO 2013/040429                                                          PCT/US2012/055535
(type A) or as in type B, tail-to-tail (3'-to-3'-branched); the ASOs could also be connected head
to-head (5'-to-5'-branched). Similarly, three or more antisense molecules can be connected
(examples C, D, E in Figure 1B). In an alternative embodiment, the multimer can be in the form
of a circular nucleic acid.
B.          Targeting oligonucleotides
         [0067]   In some embodiments, multimeric oligonucleotides provided herein comprise
two or more targeting oligonucleotides linked together by a cleavable linker. In some
embodiments, each targeting oligonucleotide has a region complementary to a target region of a
genomic target sequence. In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotide is an antisense
oligonucleotide (ASO), siRNA (e.g., a single stranded siRNA), miRNA sponge, or anti
microRNA antisense oligonucleotide (AMO). In some embodiments, the targeting
oligonucleotide binds specifically to a target RNA in a cell and brings about degradation of the
RNA. In some embodiments, the degradation is mediated by RNAse H. In some embodiments,
the degradation is mediated by an RNAi pathway. It should be appreciated that unless otherwise
apparent from context "a targeting oligonucleotide" or "the targeting oligonucleotide" as
referred to herein, generally means at least one of the targeting oligonucleotides present in a
multimeric compound. Similarly, it should be appreciated that unless otherwise apparent from
context "a linker" or "the linker," as referred to herein, generally means at least one of the
linkers present in a multimeric compound.
         [0068]   As used herein, the term "genomic target sequence" refers to a nucleotide
sequence of clinical, therapeutic or research interest in a genome (e.g., a mammalian genome,
e.g., a human or mouse genome). Typically, a genomic target sequence is a sequence of a
genome that comprises a gene coding or regulatory region, or that is present within a gene
coding or regulatory region. In some embodiments, a genomic target sequence is a sequence
that encodes at least a portion of a gene. The gene may be an non-coding RNA gene or a protein
coding gene. The non-coding RNA gene may be a long non-coding RNA gene or an miRNA
gene, for example. The product of the gene may be an RNA or protein that mediates gene
expression through an epigenetic mechanism. In other embodiments, a genomic target sequence
is a sequence positioned in a regulatory region of one or more genes, such as a promoter,
enhancer, silencer region, locus control region and other functional region of a genome.
         [0069]   In some embodiments, the genomic target sequence is present in the sense
strand of a gene. The sense strand or coding strand is the segment of double stranded DNA
                                                   16

      WO 2013/040429                                                         PCT/US2012/055535
running from 5' - 3' that is complementary to the antisense strand or template strand of a gene.
The sense strand is the strand of DNA that has the same sequence as the RNA transcribed from
the gene (e.g., mRNA, IncRNA, or miRNA), which takes the antisense strand as its template
during transcription.
         [0070]   The "target region" of a genomic target sequence is a sequence of nucleotides
that consitutes a hybridization site of a targeting oligonucleotide. The actual target
oligonucleotide may hybridize with the genomic target itself (e.g., a promoter element) or an
nucleic acid encoded by the genomic target sequence or containing the genomic target sequence
(e.g., an lncRNA, miRNA, or mRNA). In some embodiments, the target region encodes a site
on a transcribed RNA, and hybridization of a targeting oligonucleotide to the site results in
inactivation or degradation of the transcribed RNA. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the
targeting oligonucleotides hybridize to a transcribed RNA encoded by a genomic target
sequence and inhibit the function and/or effect degradation of the transcribed RNA. The RNA
may be, for example, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA, or mRNA.
         [0071]   It should be appreciated that multimeric oligonucleotides compounds provided
herein may comprise two or more targeting oligonucleotides that are each complementary to the
same or different genomic target sequences, and thus that may regulate the same or different
genes. In some embodiments, the genomic target sequences is present in the sense strand of
different genes. In some embodiments, the genomic target sequences is present in the sense
strand of the same gene.
         [0072]   In some embodiments, the genomic target sequence of at least one targeting
oligonucleotide is or comprises the sequence of a PRC-2 associated region. As used herein, the
term "PRC2-associated region" refers to a region of a nucleic acid that comprises or encodes a
sequence of nucleotides that interact directly or indirectly with a component of PRC2. A PRC2
associated region may be present in a RNA (e.g., a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)) that
interacts with a PRC2. A PRC2-associated region may be present in a DNA that encodes an
RNA that interacts with PRC2.
         [0073]   In some embodiments, a PRC2-associated region is a region of an RNA that
crosslinks to a component of PRC2 in response to in situ ultraviolet irradiation of a cell that
expresses the RNA, or a region of genomic DNA that encodes that RNA region. In some
embodiments, a PRC2-associated region is a region of an RNA that immunoprecipitates with an
antibody that targets a component of PRC2, or a region of genomic DNA that encodes that RNA
region. In some embodiments, a PRC2-associated region is a region of an RNA that
immunoprecipitates with an antibody that binds specifically to SUZ12, EED, EZH2 or RBBP4

         [0074]   In some embodiments, a PRC2-associated region is a region of an RNA that is
protected from nucleases (e.g., RNases) in an RNA-immunoprecipitation assay that employs an
antibody that targets a component of PRC2, or a region of genomic DNA that encodes that
protected RNA region. In some embodiments, a PRC2-associated region is a region of an RNA
that is protected from nucleases (e.g., RNases) in an RNA-immunoprecipitation assay that
employs an antibody that targets SUZ12, EED, EZH2 or RBBP4, or a region of genomic DNA
that encodes that protected RNA region.
         [0075]   In some embodiments, a PRC2-associated region is a region of an RNA within
which occur a relatively high frequency of sequence reads in a sequencing reaction of products
of an RNA-immunoprecipitation assay that employs an antibody that targets a component of
PRC2, or a region of genomic DNA that encodes that RNA region. In some embodiments, a
PRC2-associated region is a region of an RNA within which occur a relatively high frequency of
sequence reads in a sequencing reaction of products of an RNA-immunoprecipitation assay that
employs an antibody that binds specifically to SUZ12, EED, EZH2 or RBBP4, or a region of
genomic DNA that encodes that protected RNA region. In such embodiments, the PRC2
associated region may be referred to as a "peak."
         [0076]   In some embodiments, a PRC2-associated region comprises a sequence of 40 to
60 nucleotides that interact with PRC2 complex. In some embodiments, a PRC2-associated
region comprises a sequence of 40 to 60 nucleotides that encode an RNA that interacts with
PRC2. In some embodiments, a PRC2-associated region comprises a sequence of up to 5kb in
length that comprises a sequence (e.g., of 40 to 60 nucleotides) that interacts with PRC2. In
some embodiments, a PRC2-associated region comprises a sequence of up to 5kb in length
within which an RNA is encoded that has a sequence (e.g., of 40 to 60 nucleotides) that is
known to interact with PRC2. In some embodiments, a PRC2-associated region comprises a
sequence of about 4kb in length that comprise a sequence (e.g., of 40 to 60 nucleotides) that
interacts with PRC2. In some embodiments, a PRC2-associated region comprises a sequence of
about 4kb in length within which an RNA is encoded that includes a sequence (e.g., of 40 to 60

         [0078]   In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotides interfere with the binding
of and function of PRC2 by preventing recruitment of PRC2 to a specific chromosomal locus
through lncRNAs. For example, in some embodiments, administration of multimeric
oligonucleotide compounds comprising targeting oligonucleotides designed to specifically bind
a PRC2-associated region of a lncRNA can stably displace not only the IncRNA, but also the
PRC2 that binds to the IncRNA, from binding chromatin. Further, IncRNA can recruit PRC2 in
a cis fashion, repressing gene expression at or near the specific chromosomal locus from which
the IncRNA was transcribed.       Thus, in some embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein
may be used to inhibit cis mediated gene repression by lncRNAs.
         [0079]   In some embodiments, targeting oligonucleotides may comprise at least one
ribonucleotide, at least one deoxyribonucleotide, and/or at least one bridged nucleotide. In some

acid (LNA) nucleotide, a constrained ethyl (cEt) nucleotide, or an ethylene bridged nucleic acid
(ENA) nucleotide. Examples of such nucleotides are disclosed herein and known in the art. In
some embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises a nucleotide analog disclosed in one of the
following United States Patent or Patent Application Publications: US 7,399,845, US 7,741,457,

The oligonucleotide may consist entirely of 2' O-methyl nucleotides.
         [0080]   The targeting oligonucleotide may contain one or more nucleotide analogues.
For example, the targeting oligonucleotide may have at least one nucleotide analogue that results
in an increase in Tm of the oligonucleotide in a range of 10 C, 2 'C, 3C, 4 'C, or 5'C compared
with an oligonucleotide that does not have the at least one nucleotide analogue. The targeting
oligonucleotide may have a plurality of nucleotide analogues that results in a total increase in Tm
of the oligonucleotide in a range of 2 'C, 3 'C, 4 'C, 5 'C, 6 'C, 7 'C, 8 'C, 9 'C, 10 'C, 15 'C,

deoxyribonucleotide.
         [0083]   The targeting oligonucleotide may comprise deoxyribonucleotides flanked by at
least one bridged nucleotide (e.g., a LNA nucleotide, cEt nucleotide, ENA nucleotide) on each
of the 5' and 3' ends of the deoxyribonucleotides.     The oligonucleotide may comprise
deoxyribonucleotides flanked by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or more bridged nucleotides (e.g., LNA

         [0086]   In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotides are chimeric
oligonucleotides that contain two or more chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least
one nucleotide. These oligonucleotides typically contain at least one region of modified
nucleotides that confers one or more beneficial properties (such as, for example, increased
nuclease resistance, increased uptake into cells, increased binding affinity for the target) and a
region that is a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA:DNA or RNA:RNA hybrids.
Chimeric targeting oligonucleotides of the invention may be formed as composite structures of
two or more oligonucleotides, modified oligonucleotides, oligonucleosides and/or
oligonucleotide mimetics as described above. Such compounds have also been referred to in the
art as hybrids or gapmers. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of
such hybrid structures comprise, but are not limited to, US patent nos. 5,013,830; 5,149,797; 5,
220,007; 5,256,775; 5,366,878; 5,403,711; 5,491,133; 5,565,350; 5,623,065; 5,652,355;

         [0087]   In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotide comprises at least one
nucleotide modified at the 2' position of the sugar, most preferably a 2'-O-alkyl, 2'-O-alkyl-O
alkyl or 2'-fluoro-modified nucleotide. In other preferred embodiments, RNA modifications
include 2'-fluoro, 2'-amino and 2' O-methyl modifications on the ribose of pyrimidines, abasic
residues or an inverted base at the 3' end of the RNA. Such modifications are routinely
incorporated into oligonucleotides and these oligonucleotides have been shown to have a higher
Tm (i.e., higher target binding affinity) than 2'-deoxyoligonucleotides against a given target.
         [0088]   A number of nucleotide and nucleoside modifications have been shown to make
the oligonucleotide into which they are incorporated more resistant to nuclease digestion than a
native oligodeoxynucleotide; these modified oligos survive intact for a longer time than
unmodified oligonucleotides, in some experimental or therapeutics contexts. Specific examples
of modified oligonucleotides include those comprising modified backbones, for example,
phosphorothioates, phosphotriesters, methyl phosphonates, short chain alkyl or cycloalkyl
intersugar linkages or short chain heteroatomic or heterocyclic intersugar linkages. Most
preferred are oligonucleotides with phosphorothioate backbones and those with heteroatom
backbones, particularly CH 2 -NH-0-CH 2 , CH,-N(CH 3)~O-CH 2 (known as a
methylene(methylimino) or MMI backbone, CH 2 --O--N (CH 3 )-CH 2 , CH 2 -N (CH 3)-N (CH 3 )

         [0092]   Modified oligonucleotides are also known that include oligonucleotides that are
based on or constructed from arabinonucleotide or modified arabinonucleotide residues.
Arabinonucleosides are stereoisomers of ribonucleosides, differing only in the configuration at
the 2T-position of the sugar ring. In some embodiments, a 2'-arabino modification is 2'-F
arabino. In some embodiments, the modified oligonucleotide is 2'-fluoro-D-arabinonucleic acid

includes 2'-methoxyethoxy [2'-0-CH 2CH 2OCH 3, also known as 2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl)] (Martin
et al, HeIv. Chim. Acta, 1995, 78, 486). Other preferred modifications include 2'-methoxy (2'-0
CH 3 ), 2'-propoxy (2'-OCH 2 CH 2CH 3) and 2'-fluoro (2'-F). Similar modifications may also be
made at other positions on the oligonucleotide, particularly the Y position of the sugar on the 3'
terminal nucleotide and the 5' position of 5' terminal nucleotide. Oligonucleotides may also
have sugar mimetics such as cyclobutyls in place of the pentofuranosyl group.
         [00106] Targeting oligonucleotides can also include, additionally or alternatively,
nucleobase (often referred to in the art simply as "base") modifications or substitutions. As used
herein, "unmodified" or "natural" nucleobases include adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T),
cytosine (C) and uracil (U). Modified nucleobases include nucleobases found only infrequently
or transiently in natural nucleic acids, e.g., hypoxanthine, 6-methyladenine, 5-Me pyrimidines,
particularly 5-methylcytosine (also referred to as 5-methyl-2' deoxycytosine and often referred
to in the art as 5-Me-C), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (HMC), glycosyl HMC and gentobiosyl
HMC, isocytosine, pseudoisocytosine, as well as synthetic nucleobases, e.g., 2-aminoadenine, 2
(methylamino)adenine, 2- (imidazolylalkyl)adenine, 2- (aminoalklyamino)adenine or other
heterosubstituted alkyladenines, 2-thiouracil, 2-thiothymine, 5-bromouracil, 5

15:4513 (1987)). A "universal" base known in the art, e.g., inosine, can also be included. 5-Me
C substitutions have been shown to increase nucleic acid duplex stability by 0.6-1.2'C.
(Sanghvi, in Crooke, and Lebleu, eds., Antisense Research and Applications, CRC Press, Boca
Raton, 1993, pp. 276-278) and may be used as base substitutions. It should be appreciated that
one or more modified bases may be present in a region of complementarity of a targeting
oligonucleotide.

        [00107] It is not necessary for all positions in a given oligonucleotide to be uniformly
modified, and in fact more than one of the modifications described herein may be incorporated
in a single oligonucleotide or even at within a single nucleoside within an oligonucleotide.
        [00108] In some embodiments, both a sugar and an internucleoside linkage, i.e., the
backbone, of the nucleotide units are replaced with novel groups. The base units are maintained
for hybridization with an appropriate nucleic acid target compound. One such oligomeric
compound, an oligonucleotide mimetic that has been shown to have excellent hybridization
properties, is referred to as a peptide nucleic acid (PNA). In PNA compounds, the sugar
backbone of an oligonucleotide is replaced with an amide containing backbone, for example, an
aminoethylglycine backbone. The nucleobases are retained and are bound directly or indirectly
to aza nitrogen atoms of the amide portion of the backbone. Representative United States
patents that teach the preparation of PNA compounds include, but are not limited to, US patent
nos. 5,539,082; 5,714,331; and 5,719,262, each of which is herein incorporated by reference.
Further teaching of PNA compounds can be found in Nielsen et al, Science, 1991, 254, 1497
1500.

disclosed by Sanghvi, Chapter 15, Antisense Research and Applications," pages 289- 302,
Crooke, and Lebleu, eds., CRC Press, 1993. Certain of these nucleobases are particularly useful
for increasing the binding affinity of the oligomeric compounds of the invention. These include
5-substituted pyrimidines, 6-azapyrimidines and N-2, N-6 and 0-6 substituted purines,
comprising 2-aminopropyladenine, 5-propynyluracil and 5- propynylcytosine. 5-methylcytosine
substitutions have been shown to increase nucleic acid duplex stability by 0.6-1.2<0>C
(Sanghvi, et al., eds, "Antisense Research and Applications," CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1993, pp.
276-278) and are presently preferred base substitutions, even more particularly when combined
with 2'-O-methoxyethyl sugar modifications. Modified nucleobases are described in US patent

C.          Antisense-based targeting oligonucleotides
        [00118] In illustrative embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotides are targeting
oligonucleotides that contain locked nucleic acid 3-8-3 gapmers which have a phosphorothioate
backbone. However, in general, the chemistry of the oligonucleotide is not limited to LNA (2'
O,4'-C-methylene-bridged nucleic acids described, e.g., in PCT patent application WO
98/39352), LNA gapmers, or the phosphorothioate backbone, and can be expected to work with
any chemistry for which the target knock-down using a monomeric ASO is effective. Such
chemistries include, for instance, 2'-0,4'-C-ethylene-bridged nucleic acids (ENA; European
patent No. EP 1152009), hexitol nucleic acids (HNA; WO 93/25565 and WO 97/30064), fluoro
HNA, 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-13-D-arabino nucleic acids (FANA; EP 1088066), 2'-modified
analogs such as 2'-0-methyl (2'-OMe) and 2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl) (MOE) modified nucleic
acids, CeNA (EP 1210347 and EP 1244667) as well as phosphate-modified analogs such as
phosphoroamidate, morpholinos, base-modified analogs, such as G-clamps (WO 99/24452) and
5-alkynyl-pyrimidines. Examples of LNA other gapmers are described in PCT patent
applications published as WO 01/25248, WO 01/48190, WO 2003/085110, WO 2004/046160,
WO 2008/113832, WO 2005/023825 and WO 2007/14651; examples of FANA/DNA/FANA
gapmers are described in EP 1315807; examples of 2'-OMe/FANA/2'-OMe gapmers are
described in US patent No. 6,673,611.
                                                30

      WO 2013/040429                                                          PCT/US2012/055535
         [00119] The backbone may be stabilized by other modifications, for example,
methylphosphonate or other chemistries. The antisense oligonucleotides of this invention can
work via an RNase H mechanism, but can also work by steric blocking only, which also
includes transcriptional gene silencing and transcriptional gene activation (see, e.g., Hawkins et
al., 2009, Nucl. Acids Res., 37(9):2984-2995 and Schwartz et al., 2008, Nature Struct. Mol.
Biol., 15:842-848). The dimer/multimer approach can also be combined with any modification
which increases the delivery into cells, including lipophilic modifications, conjugates to cell
surface receptors or ligands (e.g., folate), aptamers, etc. For example, to exploit the RNAse H
mechanism, DNA:mRNA or gapmer:RNA duplexes need to be formed to permit RNAse to bind
to the substrate. However, in the case of steric blocking, RNA:RNA, RNA:2'-O-methyl-RNA,
RNA:PNA or RNA:LNA duplexes (without a DNA gap) may be used. Thus, the ASO chemistry
may be adjusted based on the intended use. Any chemistry suitable for the antisense
oligonucleotides should be applicable to the dimer/multimer approach of the invention (for the
state-of-the-art chemistries, see, e.g., Bennett and Swaize, 2009, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol.,
50:259-293; Yokota at al., 2010, Arch. Neurol., 66:32-38; Aboul-Fadl, 2005, Curr. Med. Chem.,
12:2193-2214; Kurreck, 2003, Eur. J. Biochem., 270:1628-1644).
         [00120] In some illustrative embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotides are 14
nucleotide long, but could be generally longer or shorter. For example, the targeting
oligonucleotide could be 8-50-nucleotide long, or 10-40, 10-25, 8-20, 10-25, 12-25, 12-20, 12
16, 12-15, 12-14, 12-13, 13-16, 13-15, or 13-14 nucleotides long. In some embodiments,
targeting oligonucleotides are so-called tiny LNAs, containing as few as 8 or fewer nucleotides
(see, e.g., Obad et al. (2011) Nature Genetics, 43:37 1).
         [00121] Further, in some embodiments, a targeting oligonucleotide (e.g., ASO)
comprises at least 7 contiguous nucleotides complementary to the target sequence. In further
embodiments, targeting oligonucleotide (e.g., ASO) comprises at least 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, or 40 contiguous nucleotides complementary to
a target sequence. Due to specificities and isoform variations, ASO may additionally comprise 1,
2, 3 or more non-complementary nucleotides, either within the contiguous sequences or flanking
them. In some embodiments, at least one or all of the targeting oligonucleotides are gapmers. In
other embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs) are X-N-Y gapmers, wherein at
X or Y contains 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more modified nucleotides, e.g., LNA, ENA, FANA, G-clamp,
and N is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 deoxynucleotides with non-modified sugars. For example, ASO

can be a 3-8-3, 2-10-2, 3-9-2, 2-9-3, 2-8-2, 3-7-2, 2-7-3 gapmer or another type of gapmer or
mixmer.
D.      Linkers
        [00122] The term "linker" generally refers to a chemical moiety that is capable of
covalently linking two or more targeting oligonucleotides, in which at least one bond comprised
within the linker is capable of being cleaved (e.g., in a biological context, such as in a
mammalian extract, such as an endosomal extract), such that at least two targeting
oligonucleotides are no longer covalently linked to one another after bond cleavage. It will be
appreciated that a provided linker may include a region that is non-cleavable, as long as the
linker also comprises at least one bond that is cleavable.
        [00123] In some embodiments, the linker comprises a polypeptide that is more
susceptible to cleavage by an endopeptidase in the mammalian extract than the targeting
oligonucleotides. The endopeptidase may be a trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, thermolysin,
pepsin, or endopeptidase V8. The endopeptidase may be a cathepsin B, cathepsin D, cathepsin
L, cathepsin C, papain, cathepsin S or endosomal acidic insulinase. For example, the linker
comprise a peptide having an amino acid sequence selected from: ALAL (SEQ ID NO: 125),
APISFFELG (SEQ ID NO: 126), FL, GFN, R/KXX, GRWHTVGLRWE (SEQ ID NO: 127),
YL, GF, and FF, in which X is any amino acid.
        [00124] In some embodiments, the linker comprises the formula -(CH 2)nS-S(CH 2),-,
wherein n and m are independently integers from 0 to 10.
        [00125] For example, the linker of a multimeric oligonucleotide may comprise an
oligonucleotide that is more susceptible to cleavage by an endonuclease in the mammalian
extract than the targeting oligonucleotides. The linker may have a nucleotide sequence
comprising from 1 to 10 thymidines or uridines. The linker may have a nucleotide sequence
comprising deoxyribonucleotides linked through phosphodiester intemucleotide linkages. The
linker may have a nucleotide sequence comprising from 1 to 10 thymidines linked through
phosphodiester intemucleotide linkages. The linker may have a nucleotide sequence comprising
from 1 to 10 uridines linked through phosphorothioate intemucleotide linkages. The linker may
have the formula:

have a nucleotide sequence comprising from 1 to 10 thymidines or uridines.
         [00127] In some embodiments, the linker does not comprise an oligonucleotide having a
self-complementary nucleotide sequence. In some embodiments, the linker does not comprise
an oligonucleotide having a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a region of the
genomic target sequence that is contiguous with two flanking target regions. In some
embodiments, the linker does not comprise an oligonucleotide having a self-complementary
nucleotide sequence and does not comprise an oligonucleotide having a nucleotide sequence that
is complementary to a region of the genomic target sequence that is contiguous with two
flanking target regions of the particular linker. In some embodiments, the at least one L is a
linker that does not comprise an oligonucleotide having an abasic site.
         [00128] In other embodiments, multimeric oligonucleotide compounds are provided that
comprise at least two targeting oligonucleotides each of which is linked to one or two other
targeting oligonucleotides through a linker. In some embodiments, at least one linker is 2-fold,
3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold or more sensitive to enzymatic cleavage in the presence of a
mammalian extract than at least two targeting oligonucleotides. It should be appreciated that
different linkers can be designed to be cleaved at different rates and/or by different enzymes in
compounds comprising two or more linkers. Similarly different linkers can be designed to be
sensitive to cleavage in different tissues, cells or subcellular compartments in compounds
comprising two or more linkers. This can advantageously permit compounds to have targeting
oligonucleotides that are released from compounds at different rates, by different enzymes, or in
different tissues, cells or subcellular compartments thereby controlling release of the monomeric
oligonucleotides to a desired in vivo location or at a desired time following administration.
         [00129] In some embodiments, the invention also provides ASO multimers comprising
targeting oligonucleotides having nuclease-resistant backbone (e.g., phosphorothioate), wherein
the targeting oligonucleotides are linked to each other by one or more cleavable linkers.
         [00130] In certain embodiments, linkers are stable in plasma, blood or serum which are
richer in exonucleases, and less stable in the intracellular environments which are relatively rich
in endonucleases. The intracellular stability of linkers can be assessed in vitro or in vivo as
                                                   33

     WO 2013/040429                                                             PCT/US2012/055535
described in the Examples. In some embodiments, a linker is considered "non-cleavable" if the
linker's half-life is at least 24, or 28, 32, 36, 48, 72, 96 hours or longer under the conditions
described here, such as in liver homogenates. Conversely, in some embodiments, a linker is
considered "cleavable" if the half-life of the linker is at most 10, or 8, 6, 5 hours or shorter.
         [00131] In some embodiments, the linker is a nuclease-cleavable oligonucleotide linker.
In some embodiments, the nuclease-cleavable linker contains one or more phosphodiester bonds
in the oligonucleotide backbone. For example, the linker may contain a single phosphodiester
bridge or 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more phosphodiester linkages, for example as a string of 1-10
deoxynucleotides, e.g., dT, or ribonucleotides, e.g., rU, in the case of RNA linkers. In the case of
dT or other DNA nucleotides dN in the linker, in certain embodiments the cleavable linker
contains one or more phosphodiester linkages. In other embodiments, in the case of rU or other
RNA nucleotides rN, the cleavable linker may consist of phosphorothioate linkages only. In
contrast to phosphorothioate-linked deoxynucleotides, which are only cleaved slowly by
nucleases (thus termed "noncleavable"), phosphorothioate-linked rU undergoes relatively rapid
cleavage by ribonucleases and therefore is considered cleavable herein. It is also possible to
combine dN and rN into the linker region, which are connected by phosphodiester or
phosphorothioate linkages. In other embodiments, the linker can also contain chemically
modified nucleotides, which are still cleavable by nucleases, such as, e.g., 2'-O-modified
analogs. In particular, 2'-O-methyl or 2'-fluoro nucleotides can be combined with each other or
with dN or rN nucleotides. Generally, in the case of nucleotide linkers, the linker is a part of the
multimer that is usually not complementary to a target, although it could be. This is because the
linker is generally cleaved prior to targeting oligonucleotides action on the target, and therefore,
the linker identity with respect to a target is inconsequential. Accordingly, in some
embodiments, a linker is an (oligo)nucleotide linker that is not complementary to any of the
targets against which the targeting oligonucleotides are designed.
         [00132] In some embodiments, the cleavable linker is oligonucleotide linker that
contains a continuous stretch of deliberately introduced Rp phosphorothioate stereoisomers (e.g.,
4, 5, 6, 7 or longer stretches). The Rp stereoisoform, unlike Sp isoform, is known to be
susceptible to nuclease cleavage (Krieg et al., 2003, Oligonucleotides, 13:491-499). Such a
linker would not include a racemic mix of PS linkages oligonucleotides since the mixed linkages
are relatively stable and are not likely to contain long stretches of the Rp stereoisomers, and
therefore, considered "non-cleavable" herein. Thus, in some embodiments, a linker comprises a
stretch of 4, 5, 6, 7 or more phosphorothioated nucleotides, wherein the stretch does not contain
                                                    34

      WO 2013/040429                                                        PCT/US2012/055535
a substantial amount or any of the Sp stereoisoform. The amount could be considered substantial
if it exceeds 10% on per-mole basis.
         [00133] In some embodiments, the linker is a non-nucleotide linker, for example, a
single phosphodiester bridge. Another example of such cleavable linkers is a chemical group
comprising a disulfide bond, for example, -(CH 2)nS-S(CH 2),n-, wherein n and m are integers
from 0 to 10. In illustrative embodiments, n=m=6. Additional example of non-nucleotide linkers
are described below.
         [00134] The cleavable linkers may be present in other linear or branched multimers. For
example in some branched embodiments, the cleavable linker comprises a "doubler," "trebler,"
or another branching chemical group with multiple "arms" that link phosphodiester linked
nucleotides, as for example, illustrated in Figures IC and ID and Formulas IV, V, and VIII. In
some linear embodiments, cleavable linkers can be incorporated as shown in Formulas I and II.
         [00135] The linker can be designed so as to undergo a chemical or enzymatic cleavage
reaction. Chemical reactions involve, for example, cleavage in acidic environment (e.g.,
endosomes), reductive cleavage (e.g., cytosolic cleavage) or oxidative cleavage (e.g., in liver
microsomes). The cleavage reaction can also be initiated by a rearrangement reaction.
Enzymatic reactions can include reactions mediated by nucleases, peptidases, proteases,
phosphatases, oxidases, reductases, etc. For example, a linker can be pH-sensitive, cathepsin
sensitive, or predominantly cleaved in endosomes and/or cytosol.
         [00136] In some embodiments, the linker comprises a peptide. In certain embodiments,
the linker comprises a peptide which includes a sequence that is cleavable by an endopeptidase.
In addition to the cleavable peptide sequence, the linker may comprise additional amino acid
residues and/or non-peptide chemical moieties, such as an alkyl chain. In certain embodiments,
the linker comprises Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu (SEQ ID NO.: 125), which is a substrate for cathepsin B.
See, for example, the maleimidocaproyl-Arg-Arg-Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu (SEQ ID NO.: 136) linkers
described in Schmid et al, Bioconjugate Chem 2007, 18, 702-716. In certain embodiments, a
cathepsin B-cleavable linker is cleaved in tumor cells. In certain embodiments, the linker
comprises Ala-Pro-Ile-Ser-Phe-Phe-Glu-Leu-Gly (SEQ ID NO.: 126), which is a substrate for
cathepsins D, L, and B (see, for example, Fischer et al, Chembiochem 2006, 7, 1428-1434). In
certain embodiments, a cathepsin-cleavable linker is cleaved in HeLA cells. In some
embodiments, the linker comprises Phe-Lys, which is a substrate for cathepsin B. For example,
in certain embodiments, the linker comprises Phe-Lys-p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). See, e.g.,
the maleimidocaproyl-Phe-Lys-PABA linker described in Walker et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem.
Lett. 2002, 12, 217-219. In certain embodiments, the linker comprises Gly-Phe-2

naphthylamide, which is a substrate for cathepsin C (see, for example, Berg et al. Biochem. J.
1994, 300, 229-235). In certain embodiments, a cathepsin C-cleavable linker is cleaved in
hepatocytes, In some embodiments, the linker comprises a cathepsin S cleavage site. For
example, in some embodiments, the linker comprises Gly-Arg-Trp-His-Thr-Val-Gly-Leu-Arg
Trp-Glu (SEQ ID NO.: 127), Gly-Arg-Trp-Pro-Pro-Met-Gly-Leu-Pro-Trp-Glu (SEQ ID NO.:
137), or Gly-Arg-Trp-His-Pro-Met-Gly-Ala-Pro-Trp-Glu (SEQ ID NO.: 138), for example, as
described in Lutzner et al, J. Biol. Chem. 2008, 283, 36185-36194. In certain embodiments, a
cathepsin S-cleavable linker is cleaved in antigen presenting cells. In some embodiments, the
linker comprises a papain cleavage site. Papain typically cleaves a peptide having the sequence
-R/K-X-X (see Chapman et al, Annu. Rev. Physiol 1997, 59, 63-88). In certain embodiments, a
papain-cleavable linker is cleaved in endosomes. In some embodiments, the linker comprises an
endosomal acidic insulinase cleavage site. For example, in some embodiments, the linker
comprises Tyr-Leu, Gly-Phe, or Phe-Phe (see, e.g., Authier et al, FEBS Lett. 1996, 389, 55-60).
In certain embodiments, an endosomal acidic insulinase-cleavable linker is cleaved in hepatic
cells.
         [00137] In some embodiments, the linker is pH sensitive. In certain embodiments, the
linker comprises a low pH-labile bond. As used herein, a low-pH labile bond is a bond that is
selectively broken under acidic conditions (pH < 7). Such bonds may also be termed
endosomally labile bonds, because cell endosomes and lysosomes have a pH less than 7. For
example, in certain embodiments, the linker comprises an amine, an imine, an ester, a benzoic
imine, an amino ester, a diortho ester, a polyphosphoester, a polyphosphazene, an acetal, a vinyl
ether, a hydrazone, an azidomethyl-methylmaleic anhydride, a thiopropionate, a masked
endosomolytic agent or a citraconyl group.
         [00138] In certain embodiments, the linker comprises a low pH-labile bond selected
from the following: ketals that are labile in acidic environments (e.g., pH less than 7, greater
than about 4) to form a diol and a ketone; acetals that are labile in acidic environments (e.g., pH
less than 7, greater than about 4) to form a diol and an aldehyde; imines or iminiums that are
labile in acidic environments (e.g., pH less than 7, greater than about 4) to form an amine and an
aldehyde or a ketone; silicon-oxygen-carbon linkages that are labile under acidic condition;
silicon-nitrogne (silazane) linkages; silicon-carbon linkages (e.g., arylsilanes, vinylsilanes, and
allylsilanes); maleamates (amide bonds synthesized from maleic anhydride derivatives and
amines); ortho esters; hydrazones; activated carboxylic acid derivatives (e.g., esters, amides)
designed to undergo acid catalyzed hydrolysis); or vinyl ethers. Further examples may be found
in International Patent Appln. Pub. No. WO 2008/022309, entitled POLYCONJUGATES FOR

IN VIVO DELIVERY OF POLYNUCLEOTIDES, the contents of which are incorporated herein
by reference.
         [00139] Organosilanes (e.g., silyl ethers, silyl enol ethers) are used as oxygen protecting
groups in organic synthesis. Silicon-oxygen-carbon linkages are susceptible to hydrolysis under
acidic conditions to form silanols and an alcohol (or enol). The substitution on both the silicon
atom and the alcohol carbon can affect the rate of hydrolysis due to steric and electronic effects.
This allows for the possibility of tuning the rate of hydrolysis of the silicon-oxygen-carbon
linkage by changing the substitution on either the organosilane, the alcohol, or both the
organosilane and alcohol. In addition, charged or reactive groups, such as amines or carboxylate,
may be attached to the silicon atom, which confers the labile compound with charge and/or
reactivity.
         [00140] Hydrolysis of a silazane leads to the formation of a silanol and an amine.
Silazanes are inherently more susceptible to hydrolysis than is the silicon-oxygen-carbon
linkage, however, the rate of hydrolysis is increased under acidic conditions. The substitution on
both the silicon atom and the amine can affect the rate of hydrolysis due to steric and electronic
effects. This allows for the possibility of tuning the rate of hydrolysis of the silazane by
changing the substitution on either the silicon or the amine.
         [00141] Another example of a pH labile bond is an acid labile enol ether bond. The rate
at which this labile bond is cleaved depends on the structures of the carbonyl compound formed
and the alcohol released. For example analogs of ethyl isopropenyl ether, which may be
synthesized from j-haloethers, generally have shorter half lives than analogs of ethyl
cyclohexenyl ether, which may be synthesized from phenol ethers
         [00142] Reaction of an anhydride with an amine forms an amide and an acid. Typically,
the reverse reaction (formation of an anhydride and amine) is very slow and energetically
unfavorable. However, if the anhydride is a cyclic anhydride, reaction with an amine yields a
molecule in which the amide and the acid are in the same molecule, an amide acid. The presence
of both reactive groups (the amide and the carboxylic acid) in the same molecule accelerates the
reverse reaction. In certain embodiments, the linker comprises maleamic acid. Cleavage of the
amide acid to form an amine and an anhydride is pH-dependent, and is greatly accelerated at
acidic pH. This pH-dependent reactivity can be exploited to form reversible pH-sensitive bonds
and linkers. Cis-aconitic acid has been used as such a pH-sensitive linker molecule. The y
carboxylate is first coupled to a molecule. In a second step, either the a or 0 carboxylate is
coupled to a second molecule to form a pH-sensitive coupling of the two molecules.

In some embodiments, the linker comprises a low pH-labile traceless click linker. For example,
in certain embodiments, the linker comprises azidomethyl-methylmaleic anhydride (see Maier et

Indira Chandran et al, Cancer Lett. 2012 316, 151-6). In some embodiments, the linker
comprises a low pH-labile P-thiopropionate linker (see, e.g., Dan et al, Langmuir 2011, 27, 612
7). In some embodiments, the linker comprises a low pH-labile ester (see, for example, Zhu et
al, Bioconjug. Chem. 2010, 21, 2119-27). In some embodiments, the linker comprises a low
pH-labile ketal (see, e.g., Abraham et al, J. Biomater. Sci. Polym. Ed. 2011, 22, 1001-22) or
acetal (see, e.g., Liu et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 1500). In some embodiments, the
linker comprises a low pH-labile 4-(4'-acetylphenoxy)butanoic acid linker (see, e.g., DiJoseph et
al, Blood 2004, 103, 1807-14). In some embodiments, the linker comprises a low pH-labile cis
aconityl linker (see, e.g., Haas et al, J. Drug Target 2002, 10, 81-9; Ahmad et al, Anticancer Res.

Endosomolytic polymers are polymers that, in response to a change in pH, are able to cause

For example, for certain targets, which are expressed in multiple tissues, only the knock-down in
liver may be desirable, as knock-down in other organs may lead to undesired side effects. Thus,
linkers susceptible to liver-specific enzymes, such as pyrrolase (TPO) and glucose-6
phosphatase (G-6-Pase), can be engineered, so as to limit the antisense effect to the liver mainly.
Alternatively, linkers not susceptible to liver enzymes but susceptible to kidney-specific
enzymes, such as gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, can be engineered, so that the antisense effect
is limited to the kidneys mainly. Analogously, intestine-specific peptidases cleaving Phe-Ala
and Leu-Ala could be considered for orally administered multimeric targeting oligonucleotides.
Similarly, by placing an enzyme recognition site into the linker, which is recognized by an
enzyme over-expressed in tumors, such as plasmin (e.g., PHEA-D-Val-Leu-Lys recognition
site), tumor-specific knock-down should be feasible. By selecting the right enzyme recognition
site in the linker, specific cleavage and knock-down should be achievable in many organs. In
addition, the linker can also contain a targeting signal, such as N-acetyl galactosamine for liver
targeting, or folate, vitamin A or RGD-peptide in the case of tumor or activated macrophage
targeting. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the cleavable linker is organ- or tissue-specific,
for example, liver-specific, kidney-specific, intestine-specific, etc.
         [00147] The targeting oligonucleotides can be linked through any part of the individual
targeting oligonucleotide, e.g., via the phosphate, the sugar (e.g., ribose, deoxyribose), or the
nucleobase. In certain embodiments, when linking two oligonucleotides together, the linker can
be attached e.g. to the 5'-end of the first oligonucleotide and the 3'-end of the second nucleotide,
to the 5'-end of the first oligonucleotide and the 5'end of the second nucleotide, to the 3'-end of
the first oligonucleotide and the 3'-end of the second nucleotide. In other embodiments, when
linking two oligonucleotides together, the linker can attach internal residues of each
oligonucleotides, e.g., via a modified nucleobase. One of ordinary skill in the art will
understand that many such permutations are available for multimers.
         [00148] The linkers described herein can also be used to attach other moieties to an
oligonucleotide. Such moieties include lipophilic moieties, targeting moieties (e.g., a ligand of a
cell surface receptor), and tags (e.g., a fluorescent moiety for imaging or an affinity tag such as
biotin).

        [00149] In certain embodiments, the linker is attached to an oligonucleotide via click
chemistry (for a review of using click chemistry with DNA, see El-Sagheer et al, Chem. Soc.
Rev. 2010, 39, 1388-1405). The term "click chemistry" is used to describe any facile reaction
that occurs in high yields, under mild conditions, and in the presence of diverse functional
groups, but it is most commonly used to refer to a [3+2] azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction.
Such reactions are generally catalyzed by Cu and proceed in the presence of functional groups
typically encountered in biological molecules. In some embodiments, an unnatural base is
introduced into the oligonucleotide, wherein the base is modified to comprise an alkyne or azide.

E.       Targets and Uses
         [00159] The disclosure provides a method of inhibiting target expression levels of one or
more targets, comprising administering to a cell or a subject the compounds of the invention in
an amount effective to inhibit the expression of the target(s). In certain embodiments, the target
                                                    44

     WO 2013/040429                                                             PCT/US2012/055535
is an mRNA. In other embodiments, the target could be a microRNA, as described above. In
such cases, the individual targeting oligonucleotides may be referred to as "antagomiRs." In
other embodiments, the target can be a non-coding RNA naturally expressed in the cells.
         [00160] The subjects treated according to the methods of the invention can be animals,
including humans, primates, and rodents. Cells can be present in vitro, or treated ex vivo. In
some cases, ex vivo treated cells are re-administered to the subject.
         [00161] The invention also encompasses dual and multiple target antisense inhibitors, in
particular those to treat liver diseases, metabolic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory
diseases, neurological diseases, viral, bacterial, parasitic, or prion infections and cancer. In
particular, it includes the use of dimeric antisense inhibitors to inhibit liver targets (also referred
to as "hepatic targets"), such as ApoB and ApoC3 dual inhibition. Since knock-down of ApoB
has been reported to lead to undesired lipid deposition in the liver, the simultaneous knock-down
of ApoC3 can decrease this side effect.
         [00162] In cancer, the simultaneous knock-down of two targets can lead to synergistic
anti-tumor effects. In particular, combination of targets with different mechanisms of action and
signaling pathways should be of interest, e.g., a combination of cytostatic mechanism with anti
metastatic mechanism.
         [00163] By selecting appropriate sequences against various cancer or tumor related
targets, the present invention is also suitable for cancer treatment. Thus, it is possible to use
multimeric oligonucleotides compounds of the invention that comprise targeting
oligonucleotides which are directed 1) against targets responsible for the differentiation,
development, or growth of cancers, such as: oncoproteins or transcription factors, e.g., c-myc,
N-myc, c-myb, c-fos, c-fos/jun, PCNA, p120, EJ-ras, c-Ha-ras, N-ras, rrg, bcl-2, bcl-x, bcl-w,
cdc-2, c-raf-1, c-mos, c-src, c-abl, c-ets; 2) against cellular receptors, such as EGF receptor, Her
2, c-erbA, VEGF receptor (KDR-1), retinoid receptors; 3) against protein kinases, c-fms, Tie-2,
c-raf-1 kinase, PKC-alpha, protein kinase A (RI alpha); 4) against growth or angiogenic factors,
such as bFGF, VEGF, EGF, HB-EGF, PDGF and TGF-; 5) against cytokines, such as IL-10,
against cell cycle proteins, such as cyclin-E; 6) against tumor proteins, such as MAT-8; or 7)
against inhibitors of tumor suppressor genes such as MDM-2. Also of use are antisense or
directed against 8) components of spindle formation, such as eg5 and PLK1, or 9) against targets
to suppress metastasis, such as CXCR4. Of use are antisense sequences directed against 10)

factors which suppress apoptosis, such as survivin, stat3 and hdm2, or which suppress the
expression of multiple drug resistance genes, such as MDR1 (P-glycoprotein).
        [00164] The dimer/multimer can also degrade or antagonize microRNA (miRNA) which
are single-stranded RNA molecules of about 21-23 nucleotides in length regulating gene
expression. miRNAs are encoded by genes that are transcribed from DNA but not translated into
protein (non-coding RNA); instead they are processed from primary transcripts known as pri
miRNA to short stem-loop structures called pre-miRNA and finally to functional miRNA.
Mature miRNA molecules are partially complementary to one or more messenger RNA
(mRNA) molecules, and their main function is to down-regulate gene expression. It appears that
many miRNA sequences discovered in the human genome contribute to the development of
cancer. Some miRNAs are significantly deregulated in cancer. Further, miRNA which is over
expressed (e.g., TGF- 02 receptor, RB1 and PLAG1) leading to tumor growth can be down
regulated using antisense approaches as described before. An miRNA expression signature of
human solid tumors defining cancer gene targets was reported, for example, by Volinia et al.,
PNAS, 2006, 103, 2257-6 1.
        [00165] Further provided are pharmaceutical compositions, comprising a compound of
the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Methods of formulating
and administering oligonucleotides to a cell or a subject are known in the art (see, e.g., Hardee,

Antisense Oligonucleotides. Antisense Drug Technology (2nd Edition) 2008, 217-236.

pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic properties. For example, in some case, a
therapeutically effective knockdown of the target(s) persists for two weeks or longer following
the administration. In some embodiments, the compositions of the invention are characterized by
one or more of the following properties when administered in vivo:
        (d)     increased concentration in the liver (or other tissues) and reduced clearance by
kidneys as compared to respective monomeric targeting oligonucleotides;

F.       Routes of Delivery
         [00167] A composition that includes a multimeric oligonucleotide compound can be
delivered to a subject by a variety of routes. Exemplary routes include: intravenous, intradermal,
topical, rectal, parenteral, anal, intravaginal, intranasal, pulmonary, ocular. The term
"therapeutically effective amount" is the amount of multimeric oligonucleotide compound
present in the composition that is needed to provide the desired level of target gene modulation
(e.g., inhibition or activation) in the subject to be treated to give the anticipated physiological
response. The term "physiologically effective amount" is that amount delivered to a subject to
give the desired palliative or curative effect. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier"
means that the carrier can be administered to a subject with no significant adverse toxicological
effects to the subject.
         [00168] The multimeric oligonucleotide compound molecules of the invention can be
incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such compositions
typically include one or more species of multimeric oligonucleotide compounds and a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language "pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier" is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and
antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with
pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active
substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is
incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated.
Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.
         [00169] The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered
in a number of ways depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon
the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including ophthalmic, vaginal, rectal,
intranasal, transdermal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous drip,
subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection, or intrathecal or intraventricular
administration.

     WO 2013/040429                                                           PCT/US2012/055535
         [00170] The route and site of administration may be chosen to enhance targeting. For
example, to target muscle cells, intramuscular injection into the muscles of interest would be a
logical choice. Lung cells might be targeted by administering the multimeric oligonucleotide
compound in aerosol form. The vascular endothelial cells could be targeted by coating a balloon
catheter with the multimeric oligonucleotide compound and mechanically introducing the
oligonucleotide.
         [00171] Topical administration refers to the delivery to a subject by contacting the
formulation directly to a surface of the subject. The most common form of topical delivery is to
the skin, but a composition disclosed herein can also be directly applied to other surfaces of the
body, e.g., to the eye, a mucous membrane, to surfaces of a body cavity or to an internal surface.
As mentioned above, the most common topical delivery is to the skin. The term encompasses
several routes of administration including, but not limited to, topical and transdermal. These
modes of administration typically include penetration of the skin's permeability barrier and
efficient delivery to the target tissue or stratum. Topical administration can be used as a means
to penetrate the epidermis and dermis and ultimately achieve systemic delivery of the
composition. Topical administration can also be used as a means to selectively deliver
oligonucleotides to the epidermis or dermis of a subject, or to specific strata thereof, or to an
underlying tissue.
         [00172] Formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches,
ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional
pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary
or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful.
         [00173] Transdermal delivery is a valuable route for the administration of lipid soluble
therapeutics. The dermis is more permeable than the epidermis and therefore absorption is much
more rapid through abraded, burned or denuded skin. Inflammation and other physiologic
conditions that increase blood flow to the skin also enhance transdermal adsorption. Absorption
via this route may be enhanced by the use of an oily vehicle (inunction) or through the use of
one or more penetration enhancers. Other effective ways to deliver a composition disclosed
herein via the transdermal route include hydration of the skin and the use of controlled release
topical patches. The transdermal route provides a potentially effective means to deliver a
composition disclosed herein for systemic and/or local therapy. In addition, iontophoresis
(transfer of ionic solutes through biological membranes under the influence of an electric field),
phonophoresis or sonophoresis (use of ultrasound to enhance the absorption of various
                                                  48

      WO 2013/040429                                                          PCT/US2012/055535
therapeutic agents across biological membranes, notably the skin and the cornea), and
optimization of vehicle characteristics relative to dose position and retention at the site of
administration may be useful methods for enhancing the transport of topically applied
compositions across skin and mucosal sites.
         [00174] Both the oral and nasal membranes offer advantages over other routes of
administration. For example, oligonucleotides administered through these membranes may have
a rapid onset of action, provide therapeutic plasma levels, avoid first pass effect of hepatic
metabolism, and avoid exposure of the oligonucleotides to the hostile gastrointestinal (GI)
environment. Additional advantages include easy access to the membrane sites so that the
oligonucleotide can be applied, localized and removed easily.
         [00175] In oral delivery, compositions can be targeted to a surface of the oral cavity,
e.g., to sublingual mucosa which includes the membrane of ventral surface of the tongue and the
floor of the mouth or the buccal mucosa which constitutes the lining of the cheek. The
sublingual mucosa is relatively permeable thus giving rapid absorption and acceptable
bioavailability of many agents. Further, the sublingual mucosa is convenient, acceptable and
easily accessible.
         [00176] A pharmaceutical composition of multimeric oligonucleotide compound may
also be administered to the buccal cavity of a human being by spraying into the cavity, without
inhalation, from a metered dose spray dispenser, a mixed micellar pharmaceutical formulation as
described above and a propellant. In one embodiment, the dispenser is first shaken prior to
spraying the pharmaceutical formulation and propellant into the buccal cavity.
         [00177] Compositions for oral administration include powders or granules, suspensions
or solutions in water, syrups, slurries, emulsions, elixirs or non-aqueous media, tablets, capsules,
lozenges, or troches. In the case of tablets, carriers that can be used include lactose, sodium
citrate and salts of phosphoric acid. Various disintegrants such as starch, and lubricating agents
such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc, are commonly used in tablets. For
oral administration in capsule form, useful diluents are lactose and high molecular weight
polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the nucleic acid
compositions can be combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain
sweetening and/or flavoring agents can be added.
         [00178] Parenteral administration includes intravenous drip, subcutaneous,
intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection, intrathecal or intraventricular administration. In some
                                                 49

     WO 2013/040429                                                           PCT/US2012/055535
embodiments, parental administration involves administration directly to the site of disease (e.g.
injection into a tumor).
         [00179] Formulations for parenteral administration may include sterile aqueous
solutions which may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives. Intraventricular
injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir.
For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled to render the
preparation isotonic.
         [00180] Any of the multimeric oligonucleotide compounds described herein can be
administered to ocular tissue. For example, the compositions can be applied to the surface of the
eye or nearby tissue, e.g., the inside of the eyelid. For ocular administration, ointments or
droppable liquids may be delivered by ocular delivery systems known to the art such as
applicators or eye droppers. Such compositions can include mucomimetics such as hyaluronic
acid, chondroitin sulfate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or poly(vinyl alcohol), preservatives
such as sorbic acid, EDTA or benzylchronium chloride, and the usual quantities of diluents
and/or carriers. The multimeric oligonucleotide compound can also be administered to the
interior of the eye, and can be introduced by a needle or other delivery device which can
introduce it to a selected area or structure.
         [00181] Pulmonary delivery compositions can be delivered by inhalation by the patient
of a dispersion so that the composition, preferably multimeric oligonucleotide compounds,
within the dispersion can reach the lung where it can be readily absorbed through the alveolar
region directly into blood circulation. Pulmonary delivery can be effective both for systemic
delivery and for localized delivery to treat diseases of the lungs.
         [00182] Pulmonary delivery can be achieved by different approaches, including the use
of nebulized, aerosolized, micellular and dry powder-based formulations. Delivery can be
achieved with liquid nebulizers, aerosol-based inhalers, and dry powder dispersion devices.
Metered-dose devices are preferred. One of the benefits of using an atomizer or inhaler is that
the potential for contamination is minimized because the devices are self-contained. Dry
powder dispersion devices, for example, deliver agents that may be readily formulated as dry
powders. A multimeric oligonucleotide compound may be stably stored as lyophilized or spray
dried powders by itself or in combination with suitable powder carriers. The delivery of a
composition for inhalation can be mediated by a dosing timing element which can include a
timer, a dose counter, time measuring device, or a time indicator which when incorporated into
                                                  50

     WO 2013/040429                                                           PCT/US2012/055535
the device enables dose tracking, compliance monitoring, and/or dose triggering to a patient
during administration of the aerosol medicament.
         [00183] The term "powder" means a composition that consists of finely dispersed solid
particles that are free flowing and capable of being readily dispersed in an inhalation device and
subsequently inhaled by a subject so that the particles reach the lungs to permit penetration into
the alveoli. Thus, the powder is said to be "respirable." Preferably the average particle size is
less than about 10 pm in diameter preferably with a relatively uniform spheroidal shape
distribution. More preferably the diameter is less than about 7.5 p m and most preferably less
than about 5.0 p m. Usually the particle size distribution is between about 0.1 p m and about 5 p
m in diameter, particularly about 0.3 p m to about 5 p m.
         [00184] The term "dry" means that the composition has a moisture content below about
10% by weight (% w) water, usually below about 5% w and preferably less it than about 3% w.
A dry composition can be such that the particles are readily dispersible in an inhalation device to
form an aerosol.
         [00185] The types of pharmaceutical excipients that are useful as carrier include
stabilizers such as human serum albumin (HSA), bulking agents such as carbohydrates, amino
acids and polypeptides; pH adjusters or buffers; salts such as sodium chloride; and the like.
These carriers may be in a crystalline or amorphous form or may be a mixture of the two.
         [00186] Suitable pH adjusters or buffers include organic salts prepared from organic
acids and bases, such as sodium citrate, sodium ascorbate, and the like; sodium citrate is
preferred. Pulmonary administration of a micellar multimeric oligonucleotide compound
formulation may be achieved through metered dose spray devices with propellants such as
tetrafluoroethane, heptafluoroethane, dimethylfluoropropane, tetrafluoropropane, butane,
isobutane, dimethyl ether and other non-CFC and CFC propellants.
         [00187]         Exemplary devices include devices which are introduced into the
vasculature, e.g., devices inserted into the lumen of a vascular tissue, or which devices
themselves form a part of the vasculature, including stents, catheters, heart valves, and other
vascular devices. These devices, e.g., catheters or stents, can be placed in the vasculature of the
lung, heart, or leg.
         [00188] Other devices include non-vascular devices, e.g., devices implanted in the
peritoneum, or in organ or glandular tissue, e.g., artificial organs. The device can release a
                                                 51

      WO 2013/040429                                                           PCT/US2012/055535
therapeutic substance in addition to a multimeric oligonucleotide compound, e.g., a device can
release insulin.
        [00189] In one embodiment, unit doses or measured doses of a composition that
includes multimeric oligonucleotide compound are dispensed by an implanted device. The
device can include a sensor that monitors a parameter within a subject. For example, the device
can include pump, e.g., and, optionally, associated electronics.
        [00190] Tissue, e.g., cells or organs can be treated with a multimeric oligonucleotide
compound, ex vivo and then administered or implanted in a subject. The tissue can be
autologous, allogeneic, or xenogeneic tissue. E.g., tissue can be treated to reduce graft v. host
disease . In other embodiments, the tissue is allogeneic and the tissue is treated to treat a disorder
characterized by unwanted gene expression in that tissue. E.g., tissue, e.g., hematopoietic cells,
e.g., bone marrow hematopoietic cells, can be treated to inhibit unwanted cell proliferation.
Introduction of treated tissue, whether autologous or transplant, can be combined with other
therapies. In some implementations, the multimeric oligonucleotide compound treated cells are
insulated from other cells, e.g., by a semi-permeable porous barrier that prevents the cells from
leaving the implant, but enables molecules from the body to reach the cells and molecules
produced by the cells to enter the body. In one embodiment, the porous barrier is formed from
alginate.
        [00191] In one embodiment, a contraceptive device is coated with or contains a
multimeric oligonucleotide compound. Exemplary devices include condoms, diaphragms, IUD
(implantable uterine devices, sponges, vaginal sheaths, and birth control devices.
G.      Dosage
        [00192] In one aspect, the invention features a method of administering a multimeric
oligonucleotide compound to a subject (e.g., a human subject). In one embodiment, the unit
dose is between about 10 mg and 25 mg per kg of bodyweight. In one embodiment, the unit
dose is between about 1 mg and 100 mg per kg of bodyweight. In one embodiment, the unit
dose is between about 0.1 mg and 500 mg per kg of bodyweight. In some embodiments, the unit
dose is more than 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 mg per kg of
bodyweight.
        [00193] The defined amount can be an amount effective to treat or prevent a disease or
disorder, e.g., a disease or disorder associated with a particular target gene. The unit dose, for
                                                 52

     WO 2013/040429                                                              PCT/US2012/055535
example, can be administered by injection (e.g., intravenous or intramuscular), an inhaled dose,
or a topical application.
         [00194] In some embodiments, the unit dose is administered daily. In some
embodiments, less frequently than once a day, e.g., less than every 2, 4, 8 or 30 days. In another
embodiment, the unit dose is not administered with a frequency (e.g., not a regular frequency).
For example, the unit dose may be administered a single time. In some embodiments, the unit
dose is administered more than once a day, e.g., once an hour, two hours, four hours, eight
hours, twelve hours, etc.
         [00195] In one embodiment, a subject is administered an initial dose and one or more
maintenance doses of a multimeric oligonucleotide compound. The maintenance dose or doses
are generally lower than the initial dose, e.g., one-half less of the initial dose. A maintenance
regimen can include treating the subject with a dose or doses ranging from 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg
of body weight per day, e.g., 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, or 0.0001 mg per kg of bodyweight per
day. The maintenance doses may be administered no more than once every 1, 5, 10, or 30 days.
Further, the treatment regimen may last for a period of time which will vary depending upon the
nature of the particular disease, its severity and the overall condition of the patient. In some
embodiments the dosage may be delivered no more than once per day, e.g., no more than once
per 24, 36, 48, or more hours, e.g., no more than once for every 5 or 8 days. Following
treatment, the patient can be monitored for changes in his condition and for alleviation of the
symptoms of the disease state. The dosage of the oligonucleotide may either be increased in the
event the patient does not respond significantly to current dosage levels, or the dose may be
decreased if an alleviation of the symptoms of the disease state is observed, if the disease state
has been ablated, or if undesired side-effects are observed.
         [00196] The effective dose can be administered in a single dose or in two or more doses,
as desired or considered appropriate under the specific circumstances. If desired to facilitate
repeated or frequent infusions, implantation of a delivery device, e.g., a pump, semi-permanent
stent (e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracisternal or intracapsular), or reservoir may be
advisable.
         [00197] Following successful treatment, it may be desirable to have the patient undergo
maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the disease state, wherein the compound of the
invention is administered in maintenance doses, ranging from 0.000 1 mg to 100 mg per kg of
body weight.
                                                   53

     WO 2013/040429                                                            PCT/US2012/055535
         [00198] The concentration of the multimeric oligonucleotide compound is an amount
sufficient to be effective in treating or preventing a disorder or to regulate a physiological
condition in humans. The concentration or amount of multimeric oligonucleotide compound
administered will depend on the parameters determined for the agent and the method of
administration, e.g. nasal, buccal, pulmonary. For example, nasal formulations may tend to
require much lower concentrations of some ingredients in order to avoid irritation or burning of
the nasal passages. It is sometimes desirable to dilute an oral formulation up to 10-100 times in
order to provide a suitable nasal formulation.
         [00199] Certain factors may influence the dosage required to effectively treat a subject,
including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the
general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a
subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a multimeric oligonucleotide compound can
include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. It will also be
appreciated that the effective dosage of a multimeric oligonucleotide compound used for
treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment. For example, the
subject can be monitored after administering a multimeric oligonucleotide compound. Based on
information from the monitoring, an additional amount of the multimeric oligonucleotide
compound can be administered.
         [00200] Dosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the disease condition to
be treated, with the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months, or until a
cure is effected or a diminution of disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can be
calculated from measurements of target gene expression levels in the body of the patient.
Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies and
repetition rates. Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of individual
compounds, and can generally be estimated based on EC50s found to be effective in in vitro and
in vivo animal models. In some embodiments, the animal models include transgenic animals
that express a human target gene. In another embodiment, the composition for testing includes a
multimeric oligonucleotide compound that is complementary, at least in an internal region, to a
sequence that is conserved between target gene in the animal model and the target gene in a
human.
         [00201] In one embodiment, the administration of the multimeric oligonucleotide
compound is parenteral, e.g. intravenous (e.g., as a bolus or as a diffusible infusion),
intradermal, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intrathecal, intraventricular, intracranial,
                                                  54

subcutaneous, transmucosal, buccal, sublingual, endoscopic, rectal, oral, vaginal, topical,
pulmonary, intranasal, urethral or ocular. Administration can be provided by the subject or by
another person, e.g., a health care provider. The composition can be provided in measured doses
or in a dispenser which delivers a metered dose. Selected modes of delivery are discussed in
more detail below.
H.      Kits
         [00202] In certain aspects of the invention, kits are provided, comprising a container
housing a composition comprising a multimeric oligonucleotide compound. In some
embodiments, the composition is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a multimeric
oligonucleotide compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments,
the individual components of the pharmaceutical composition may be provided in one container.
Alternatively, it may be desirable to provide the components of the pharmaceutical composition
separately in two or more containers, e.g., one container for multimeric oligonucleotide
compounds, and at least another for a carrier compound. The kit may be packaged in a number
of different configurations such as one or more containers in a single box. The different
components can be combined, e.g., according to instructions provided with the kit. The
components can be combined according to a method described herein, e.g., to prepare and
administer a pharmaceutical composition. The kit can also include a delivery device.
         [00203] The following examples provide illustrative embodiments of the invention. One
of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the numerous modifications and variations that may be
performed without altering the spirit or scope of the present invention. Such modifications and
variations are encompassed within the scope of the invention. The Examples do not in any way
limit the invention.

Example 1:      Design of Antisense Oligonucleotides
        [00204] Antisense oligonucleotides against ApoC3, ApoB, Hif-lalpha, survivin and
B2M were either selected using a series of bioinformatics filters and computational design
algorithms or were derived from the literature. They were selected to be 13, 14 or more
nucleotides in length and tested using one or multiple chemical modification design patterns (for
example, 3LNAs-8DNAs-3LNAs). The list of all targeting oligonucleotide sequences is given in
Table 1 and specific chemical modification patterns are explicitly specified when data is
presented. Factors taken into account during the design include species homology, alignment to
multiple human transcripts, off-target matches, SNPs, exon-exon boundaries, coverage of the
transcript, and statistical models of efficacy and polyA regions. For species homology human,
rat, mouse and macaque sequences were considered. For off-target matches, putative sequences
were searched against the human transcriptome and perfect matches were identified along with
compounds that had only 1 or 2 mismatches. Preference was given to compounds with no
perfect off-target matches, but compounds were selected with 1 or 2 mismatches if the
compound met many of the other criteria. Statistical classification models were derived from
existing in-house projects for other targeting oligonucleotide projects. These models were
applied to the potential ASOs and preference given to those classified as active. Known SNPs,
exon-exon boundaries and polyA regions were also avoided in the design when possible. Other
ASO design features are also well known in the art, such as avoidance of immune stimulatory
sequences such as CpG motifs, avoidance of poly G regions, and avoidance of toxic sequences
such as certain poly-pyrimidine motifs.
        [00205] Figures 1A and lB show schematic representation of exemplary
dimeric/multimeric constructs. Specifically, in Figure 1A, two 14-mer gapmers (e.g., 3LNA
8DNA-3LNA) are connected via a cleavable linker, which can be cleaved by enzymes, such as
nucleases, peptidases or by reduction or oxidation. It could also be a linker which is cleaved by a
pH shift within the cells (e.g. acidic pH in endosomes). The two antisense gapmers can be
identical (homo-dimer), which leads to suppression of a single target mRNA1. However, the two
antisense gapmers can also have different sequences (hetero-dimer) which are complementary to
two or more different targets and which will lead to inhibition of two targets (mRNA 1 and
mRNA2) or trimers or tetramers, etc., specific to 3, 4, or more different targets.

Example 2: Synthesis of Antisense Oligonucleotides
(A) General Procedure for Oligomer Synthesis
        [00206] All oligonucleotides were synthesized using standard phosphoramidite
protocols (Beaucage, S.L.; Caruthers, M.H. "Deoxynucleoside phosphoramidites - A new class
of key intermediates for deoxypolynucleotide synthesis". Tetrahedron Lett., 1981, 22:1859) on a
MerMade 192 oligonucleotide synthesizer (BioAutomation) or Oligopilot 10 synthesizer (GE) at
200 to 1000 nmole scales employing standard CPG supports (BioSearch) or Glen UnySupport
(Glen Research). The DNA, 2'-OMe, 2'-F, and G-clamp monomers were obtained from
ChemGenes Corporation or Glen Research, and the LNA monomers were obtained from other
commercially available sources. All phosphoramidites other than DNA were coupled with
extended coupling times (e.g. 8 to 15 min for RNA, LNA, 2'-O-Methyl, 2'-Fluoro, 5-Propynyl
and G-Clamps). After the synthesis, the oligonucleotides were cleaved from the support and
deprotected using AMA (a 50:50 mixture of ammonium hydroxide and aqueous methylamine) at
65 C for one hour or using aqueous ammonium hydroxide at 55 'C for 8 hours. The crude
DMTr-on oligonucleotides were purified via DMTr-selective cartridge purification techniques
and if necessary further purified via RP HPLC and desalted via cartridge-based
methods. Alternatively, they were purified using ion exchange chromatography. The final
oligonucleotides were characterized using LC-MS.
        [00207] A C Technologies Solo VP Slope (Bridgewater, NJ) reader equipped with
"Quick Slope" software was used to determine the concentration of oligonucleotides. Fifty l of
sample was required for the measurement in a micro quartz vessel. The instrument measured the
change in absorbance at varying path lengths, utilizing Beer's Law to determine final
concentrations. Extinction coefficients were calculated using the nearest neighbor model.
(B) Synthesis of linear dimers and trimers
        [00208] The synthesis of linear dimers and trimers was completed by linear addition of
all monomers until the full length sequence was obtained on solid support. First, ASO 1 was
completely synthesized followed by addition of the cleavable or noncleavable linker X (e.g., tri
thymidyl, tetra-thymidyl, tetra-uridyl, disulfide, etc.) and finally either ASO 1 ("homo"-dimer)
or an ASO with another sequence ASO 2 ("hetero"-dimer) and optionally directed against
another target mRNA was added. The ASO synthesized first is connected to the linker X via its
5'-end whereas the finally synthesized ASO is connected via 3'. This might lead to 3'- and 5'

(D) Synthesis of branched trimers
         [00218] For the synthesis of trimers with two different ASO molecules, the first ASO1 is
synthesized by linear addition of all monomers until the full length sequence of ASO1 was
obtained on solid support. Then, the cleavable (or noncleavable) linker X (tetrathymidyl,
tetrauridyl, disulfide etc.) is synthesized followed by addition of the doubler using a symmetric
doubler phosphoramidite (Glen Research, 10-1920) the solid phase synthesis of the linker X and
ASO 1 was performed in parallel as indicated in the figure below.
         [00219] After removal of the DMT protecting groups of the symmetric doubler, two
ASO2 molecules are synthesized simultaneously from 3' to 5' direction using standard
phosphoramidite chemistry. This results in a trimer consisting of two ASO2 molecules having
two free 5'-ends and one ASO1 molecule having one free 3'-end of the structure shown in
Figure ID.
         [00220] For the synthesis of branched trimers consisting of three different ASO1, ASO2
and ASO3 molecules, the non-symmetric brancher phosphoramidite is coupled after first
synthesis of ASO1, followed by sequential synthesis of ASO2 and ASO3. The non-symmetrical
phosphoramidite structure is shown in Formula IX. The resulting trimer has the structure show
in Figure ID.

Example 3:        Dimer Stability in Plasma and Cleavage in Liver Homogenates
          [00226] Stability measurements were performed using 4 different oligonucleotides
(including dimers and the monomer, SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, 3, 4).
          [00227] Briefly, oligos were incubated in 95 % plasma of mouse or monkey and in 5 %
liver homogenate at a concentration of 30 pM and at 37 'C. Samples for measurement were
taken after 0, 7, 24 and 48 h of incubation. Samples were subjected to a phenol/chloroform
extraction and analyzed using LC-MS.
          [00228] In detail, stock solutions with a final concentration of 600 PM and a final
volume of 100 p1 have been prepared of all oligonucleotides. Twelve pieces of approximately 50
mg of liver from CD 1 mouse (female, Charles River) were added to individual Lysing matrix
tubes. A calculated volume of 1x PBS to give a final concentration of 5 % liver (W/W) was
added to each of the twelve tubes. All samples were homogenized using a BioRad Fast prep
System. The resulting homogenate solutions were combined to give about 12 ml of 5 % liver
homogenate in 1x PBS which was subsequently used for incubation.
          [00229] Plasmas used were a Na-Citrate plasma from female NMRI mice (Charles
River) and K-EDTA plasma from male Cynomolgous monkeys (Seralab International).
          [00230] Four samples of each oligo were prepared representing each individual
incubation time point (0, 7, 24 and 48 h) in mouse and monkey plasma and in mouse liver

homogenate, respectively. In addition, a blank sample and a recovery sample were prepared of
each oligo and incubation matrix. Generally, plasma samples were prepared by adding 5 I of
the 600 pM oligo stock solution to 95 p1 of mouse or monkey plasma, respectively, with a final
oligo concentration of 30 pM. Recovery samples were prepared by adding 5 P1 of water to 95 P1
of plasma. Blank samples are oligo in water with a final concentration of 100 PM. Liver samples
and recoveries were prepared in the same way except that liver homogenate in PBS was used
instead of plasma.
         [00231] All samples and recoveries were incubated at 37 'C. Samples were cooled to
room temperature after 0, 7, 24 and 48 h and was subjected to phenol/chloroform purification.
To that end, 370 p1 of ammonium hydroxide (15 %), 10 p1 dithiothreitol (DTT, 1 M, Sigma Cat.
No. 43816) and 800 p1 premixed phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (Sigma P2069) was added
to each sample. Samples were then vortexed for 10 min at a maximum vortex speed and
incubated at 4 'C for 20 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 3500 RFC for 20 min at 4 'C
and 400 p1 of the aqueous layer were removed and dried in a lyophilizer.
         [00232] The dried samples were dissolved in water (100     l). The recovery samples were
dissolved in water (95 l) and spiked with 5 l of the respective oligo stock solution (600 PM).
         [00233] Samples were analyzed by LC-MS (Agilent 1200, Bruker Esquire 3000) using a
Waters Acquity UPLC OST C18 column (1.7 pm, 2.1x50) with HFIP/TEA/water (385 mM
1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol, 14.4 mM triethylamine in water) as buffer A and methanol as
buffer B at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min and a column temperature of 60 'C. The following gradient
was used: 3 min at 5% B, 5-15 % B in 2.5 min (10%/min), 15-23 % B in 5.5 min, 23-30 % B in
3 min, 30-100 % B in 0.5 min, 5 min at 100 % B, 100-5 % B in 0.5 min, 5 min at 5 % B.
         [00234] Samples were analyzed in 96-well plate format. A standard curve with 8
standards (5, 10, 15, 20, 50, 75, 90, 100 pg/ml; 25 pg/ml IS), standard 0 (0 pg/ml; 25 Pg/ml IS)
and three recovery samples (20, 50, 100 pg/ml; 25 pg/ml IS) were prepared for each oligo.
Samples related to one oligo were analyzed together on the same plate.
         [00235] Standards were prepared as follows. A piece of approximately 50 mg of tissue
was cut from the respective organ tissue, weighted and placed into the respective well of a 2.2
ml 96-deepwell plate (VWR 732-0585). Two steel balls (5 mm diameter, KGM Kugelfabrik
GmbH, part No. 1.3541) were placed into each well and 500 p1 homogenization buffer (vide
infra), 20 p1 DTT (1 M, Sigma 43816), 50 p1 of proteinase K solution (Qiagen, 19133) was
added. Furthermore, 10 p1 working solution analyte and 10 p1 working solution internal standard
was added into each well of the standards to give the corresponding final concentrations of (5,
10, 15, 20, 50, 75, 90, 100 pg/ml; 25 pg/ml IS (Internal Standard)). Standard 0 and recovered

         [00236] Samples were processed as follows. A piece of approximately 50 mg of tissue
was cut from the respective organ tissue, weighed and placed into the respective well of a 96
deepwell plate. Two steel balls were placed into each well and 500 PI homogenization buffer
20 p1 DTT (1 M), 50 p1 of proteinase K solution was added. The plate was sealed with STAR
lab foils (StarLab E 2796 3070) and samples were homogenized using a Qiagen Tissue Lyzer 3x
30 s at 17 Hz. Subsequently, the plate was incubated in a water bath for 2 hours at 55 'C
followed by transfer of the samples to a new 96-deepwell plate using an automated liquid
handling system (TomTec Quadra 3). After the addition of 200 P1 ammonium hydroxide (25 %)
and 500 p1 phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) the plate was vortexed using a
Multitubevortex for 5 min. Subsequently, the plate was incubated for 10 min at 4 'C and
centrifuged at 4 'C for another 10 min at 3500 RCF. The plate was then passed to the TomTec
system which was used to remove the aqueous layer. The remaining organic layer was washed
by adding 500 p1 water. The aqueous phase was again removed using the TomTec system. The
aqueous phases were combined, 50 p1 HCl (1 N), 500 p1 SAX Load High buffer (see below) and
300 p1 acetonitrile were added, and the resulting solution was mixed thoroughly by up-and
down pipetting using the TomTec system. The program "SPE extraction of tissue samples
100416" was used for the subsequent solid-phase extraction procedure.

of dimer in liver homogenates as determined by LC-MS. Figures 2A and 2B demonstrate slow
degradation of both ApoC3 ASO monomer (SEQ ID NO: 1, designated as per Example 2(E)) and
cleavable ApoC3-ApoC3 ASO dimers (SEQ ID NO:2 and SEQ ID NO:4) in murine and
monkey plasmas respectively. Figure 2C demonstrates efficient degradation of the cleavable
ApoC3-ApoC3 ASO dimers (SEQ ID NO:2 and SEQ ID NO:4) and the relative stability
ApoC3 ASO monomer (SEQ ID NO: 1) in mouse liver homogenate. Figure 2D shows cleavable
SEQ ID NO: 18) and noncleavable SEQ ID NO: 19) ApoB-ApoB ASO homodimers incubated in
murine plasma or liver homogenate, demonstrating stability of both types of molecules in
plasma, and a more efficient degradation of the cleavable version in the liver homogenate.

Cell Culture Protocol
         [00239] Human hepatocarcinoma cells (Hep3B) were acquired from the "Deutsche
Sammlung von Mirkoorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH" (DSMZ). For the KD studies, 3.000
10.000 cells/well were seeded (1-3 days prior to treatment) into 96 multi-titer plates yielding 70
80% confluence on the day of treatment. For assays using lipotransfection delivery techniques,
cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of ASO formulated with 0.3 I
Lipofectamine 2000 (L2k) for 48 hr in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (Lonza, Verviers,
Belgium) with L-glutamine (2 mM).
Knock-Down Analysis Protocol
         [00240] Following the treatment period mRNA levels of target and reference (a
housekeeping gene) mRNA was determined by the Quanti Gene Assay (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufactures standard protocol. Prior to lysis, cell viability
was analyzed by Cell Titer Blue Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Inactive, scrambled,

     WO 2013/040429                                                        PCT/US2012/055535
ASO was used as negative control and reference (SEQ ID NO:3 1). The QuantiGene 2.0 assay
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was utilized to measure the expression level of target genes in
Hep3B cells before and after the incubation with the ASOs . Human ApoB/ApoC3 probes and
housekeeping gene PPIB probes were purchased from Affymetrix. Standard assay procedures
were carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations. On the day of harvesting,
200 I/well of lysis buffer (with 1:100 protease K) was added to the cells. A total of 60 I of
lysate was used for human ApoC3 probes, while 20 p1 lysate was used for human ApoB and
PPIB probes respectively. Assay plates were read on the GloRunner Microplate Luminometer
(Promega Corp, Sunnyvale, CA). The data were normalized against housekeeping gene PPIB.
Transfection Protocol
         [00241] Hep3B cells were treated with 8 consecutive concentrations (0.001, 0.006, 0.03,
0.2, 0.8, 4.0, 20 and 100 nM) of oligonucleotide were formulated with the Lipotransfection
agent. mRNA content and cell viability were determined after 48 hr of treatment.
         [00242] The results of the above experiments are presented in Figure 3A. All
homodimers derived from the human sequence show knockdown. Homodimers with thiol (S-S)
bridges (SEQ ID NOs:2 and 4) showed increased cytotoxicity. At the same time, the homodimer
made from the murine ApoC3 ortholog (SEQ ID NO:6) was ineffective
Example 5:       In Vitro Comparisons of Cleavable vs. Noncleavable Linker Designs With
ApoC3 Homodimers (Figures 3B, 3C, 3J, 3K)
         [00243] Cell were treated and analyzed as described in Example 4. For "gymnotic
delivery," the cells were not transfected with the ASO, but instead were incubated with indicated
concentrations of unformulated ASO in MEM with high glucose (6 g/l; Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) without L-glutamine for 8 days. The results are presented in Figures 3B, 3C, 3J and
3K.
         [00244] When using lipotransfection techniques, the ApoC3 homodimers with more
easily cleavable linkers (Figure 3B, SEQ ID NOs: 15 and 17) showed a higher knock-down
activity than their less cleavable counterpart (Figure 3B, SEQ ID NO: 16). The same effect was
seen with gymnotic delivery (Figure 3C). Figure 3J shows that the knock-down activity from
the ApoC3 homodimer (SEQ ID NO: 15) is better compared to the same sequence used as
monomer (SEQ ID NO:30). Figure 3K shows that the ApoC3 homodimer, if connected via a
metabolically unstable linker (SEQ ID NO: 15), is much more effective than its counterpart
                                                 88

connected by a stable linker (SEQ ID NO: 16).
Example 6:      In Vitro Tests Of Cleavable Vs. Noncleavable Linker Designs With ApoB
Homodimers (Figures 3D, 3E, 3H, 31)
         [00245] Cell culture, knock-down analysis and transfection procedures were performed
as described in Example 5. The results are presented in Figures 3D, 3E, 3H and 31. In
lipotransfection assays, the ApoB homodimers with easily cleavable linkers (Figure 3D,
SEQ ID NOs: 18, 20) showed a higher knock-down activity than their metabolic more stable
analog (Figure 3D, SEQ ID NO: 19). The same effect was seen with gymnotic delivery (Figure
3E). Figure 3H shows that the knock-down activity from the ApoB homodimer
(SEQ ID NO:18) is better compared to the same sequence used as a monomer (SEQ ID NO:13).
Figure 31 shows that the ApoB homodimer, if connected via a metabolically unstable linker
(SEQ ID NO: 18), is much more effective than its counterpart connected by a stable linker
(SEQ ID NO:19).
Example 7:      In Vitro Tests of Cleavable Linkers of Different Lengths With ApoB
Homodimers (Figure 3F, 3G)
         [00246] Cell culture, knock-down analysis and transfection procedures were performed
as described in Example 5. The results are presented in Figures 3F and 3G. For Figure 3F,
increasing numbers of DNA-phosphodiester linkages (ranging from one (SEQ ID NO:44) to
eight (SEQ ID NO:49)) were used to link the ApoB ASO sequences. The increasing the length
of the linker did not have a significant effect on the knockdown activity of the homodimer.
Figure 3G demonstrates that using RNA-phosphorothioate linkers of different lengths (from one
(SEQ ID NO:51) to four (SEQ ID NO:54)) also did not produce a significant impact on the
knockdown activity of the homodimer.

ApoB/ApoC3 ASO Heterodimers Using Lipotransfection and Gymnotic delivery (Figures
4A and 4B)
         [00247] Cell culture, knock-down analysis and transfection procedures were performed
as described in Example 5. The results are presented in Figures 4A and 4B, wherein the
                                                 89

monomers for ApoC3 (SEQ ID NO:30) and ApoB (SEQ ID NO: 13) show specific knock-down
of the target mRNA, the ApoC3/ApoB heterodimers (SEQ ID NOs:21 and 22) show an intrinsic
knock-down potential for both targets, independent of the transfection method used (Figure 4A
- lipotransfection; Figure 4B - gymnotic delivery).
Example 9:      In Vitro Activity Assessment By Gymnotic Delivery For Knock-Down
Activity Of Cleavable ApoB/ApoC3 Heterodimers With Various Chemical Modifications
(Figures 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F, 4G, 4H, 41, and 4J)
         [00248] Cell culture, knock-down analysis and transfection procedures were performed
as described in Example 5. The results are presented in Figures 4C and 4D. In Figure 4C, all
ApoC3/ApoB heterodimers with different modifications (e.g., 2'-OMe, 2'F, 5-Prop.) showed a
comparable knock-down activity toward both targets. Figure 4D shows that also 5-propynyl
modifications (SEQ ID NOs:41 and 42) and different amounts of LNA motifs (SEQ ID NO:40)
do not change the overall knock-down activity. However, using a G-clamp modification for the
ApoB ASO sequence (SEQ ID NO:38) decreases the knock-down potential for ApoB mRNA.
Figures 4F-J depict the individual heterodimers versus the monomers used for the design. In
Figure 4E, the heterodimer (SEQ ID NO:33) assembled from SEQ ID NO: 13 and
SEQ ID NO:55 increases in knock-down activity toward both targets. In Figure 4F, the
heterodimer (SEQ ID NO:34) assembled from SEQ ID NO: 13 and SEQ ID NO:56 increased in
potency in lower concentration only for the ApoB target. In Figure 4G, the heterodimer
(SEQ ID NO:35) assembled from SEQ ID NO:13 and SEQ ID NO:57 increased in potency in
lower concentrations for ApoB, while losing activity for ApoC3. In Figure 4H, the heterodimer
(SEQ ID NO:36) assembled from SEQ ID NO:13 and SEQ ID NO:58 increased in knock-down
potency in lower concentrations for ApoB, while losing activity for ApoC3. In Figure 41, the
heterodimer (SEQ ID NO:39) assembled from SEQ ID NO: 13 and SEQ ID NO: 1 increased in
potency in lower concentrations for ApoB, while showing a strong increase in knock-down
activity for ApoC3. In Figure 4J, the heterodimer SEQ ID NO:21 assembled from
SEQ ID NO: 13 and SEQ ID NO:30 showed no modification of knock-down for ApoB, while
ApoC3 knock-down activity decreased.

        [00249] Cell culture, knock-down analysis and transfection procedures were performed

        [00251] Cell culture, knock-down analysis and transfection procedures were performed
as described in Example 5. The diagram in Figure 4M depicts that the assembled HIF
lalpha/ApoB/ApoC3 heterotrimer (SEQ ID NO:26) inherits the individual knock-down
potentials of all parent sequences (SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO:27, SEQ ID NO:30). A decrease
in activity was observed for ApoC3 and ApoB.
Example 13: Comparison of Dimer and Monomer Activity In Vivo
        [00252] Acute in vivo activity assessments were performed in male and female human
ApoC3 transgenic mice (Jackson Labs Stock 905918, B6; CBA Tg (APOC3) 3707Bres/J),
which are on a C57BL/6 background and express the human apoC3 gene including the human
promoter. Male (22-30 g) and female mice (20-25 g) employed in this study were 10 weeks old
and fed regular chow diet.
        [00253] ApoC3 ASO homodimers (SEQ ID NOs:4, 5, 2, or 3) or ApoC3 ASO monomer
SEQ ID NO: 1 were formulated in sterile PBS pH7.0 (Gibco) for each dose immediately before

subcutaneous (sc) injection. Animals were administered equal volumes (100          1d)of the
homodimers or monomer via sc route between the shoulder blades. A control group was treated
using equal volumes of PBS in parallel. Each treatment group consisted of 3 male and 4 female
transgenic mice.
        [00254] Mouse blood was collected at Day 0 and Day 7 via submandibular puncture
(50-75    1il),as well as at study termination (Day 14) by cardiac puncture, post-euthanasia. Blood
was collected in serum separator tubes at room temperature and allowed to clot for 30 minutes.
Tubes were spun at 1000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature and serum above separator layer
was collected and immediately aliquotted and frozen at -80 'C for future analysis. ApoC3
protein was determined using an ELISA (Wang et al., J. Lipid Res., 2011, 52(6):1265-7 1).
        [00255] Effects on ApoC3 expression in the liver were also assessed at study
termination (Day 14) and baseline ApoC3 mRNA levels were determined from a group of mice
euthanized on Day 0 of the study. Liver lobes were excised immediately after euthanasia and
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was subsequently isolated and ApoC3 mRNA expression
was determined using the Affymetrix bDNA kit (QuantiGene, Affymetrix). The ApoC3 mRNA
expression was normalized to mouse GAPDH, a housekeeper gene, and reported as percent
ApoC3 knockdown (KD) when compared to a PBS-treated control group.
        [00256] The results of the in vivo studies are shown in Figures 5A-C, which
demonstrate that under the conditions tested, the time course of knock-down depended on the
type of linker used to connect the two antisense moieties in the dimeric antisense ODN. Figure
5A demonstrates an associated increased reduction of liver ApoC3 mRNA levels in human
ApoC3 transgenic mice following treatment with the endonuclease-sensitive phosphodiester
linked homodimers (SEQ ID NO:4 and SEQ ID NO:2). Human ApoC3 transgenic mice were
administered a single subcutaneous dose of homodimers SEQ ID NO:5 or 3, which are
disulphide-linked homodimers of the same monomer (each at 10 mg/kg), or vehicle.
SEQ ID NO:4 and 2 exhibited an increased reduction of liver ApoC3 mRNA levels compared to
the monomer (SEQ ID NO: 1) after 14 days. Figures 5B and 5C show ApoC3 protein knock
down 7 days (Figure 5B) and 14 days (Figure 5C) after a single 10 mg/kg dose of the monomer
and dimeric LNA gapmers (SEQ ID NO:4 and 3) in human ApoC3 transgenic mice. The 3'3'
phosphodiester-linked dimer with a total of eight phosphodiester linkages (SEQ ID NO:4) shows
the fastest onset of knockdown after a single 10 mg/kg dose. This demonstrates that the
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties can be modulated by selecting a desirable linker.

Example 14: Biodistribution of Dimers
         [00257] In a separate in vivo experiment, the bio-distribution of three dimers
SEQ ID NOs:4, 2 and 3 was investigated in mice. The cleavage products were analyzed by
capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) which was performed on a PACE/MDQ system (Beckman
Coulter) equipped with the Karat 7.0 software (Beckman Coulter). Further parts were: eCAP
DNA capillary, neutral, 21 cm, 100 pm I.D. (Beckman # 477477); ssDNA 100 R gel (Beckman
# 477621); buffer: Tris/boric acid/EDTA buffer containing 7 M urea (Beckman # 338481). The
cleavage products were further characterized using LC-ESI-TOF experiments which were
performed on a Bruker Esquire 6000 and an Agilent 1200 HPLC system, together with Waters
ACQUITY UPLC OST C18 1.7 [tm (part # 186003949) column. Tissue homogenization was
done with a Multi-Tube Vortexer (VWR) and Lysing Matrix D (MP Biomedicals). Plate shaking
was done using a VarioMag monoshaker. Deep-well plates were from VWR (2.2 ml, cat. No.
732-0585) and were sealed with Clear seal diamond foil (Thermo, cat. No. 732-4890) prior to
tissue homogenization and were resealed for phenol/chloroform-extraction using Re-Seal (3M
Empore 98-0604-0472-4 adhesive). Acetonitrile was purchased from Merck.
Phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, P2069-100ML) and dithiothreitol (DTT, cat. No.
43816) were from Sigma, Proteinase K was from Qiagen (cat. No. 19133), Slide-A-lyzer (200

Plasma and liver homogenate stability experiments
        [00258] Stock solutions with a final concentration of 600 pM and a final volume of 100
pL have been prepared of all oligonucleotides.
        [00259] Twelve pieces of approximately 50 mg of liver from CD1 mouse (female,
Charles River) were added to individual Lysing matrix tubes. A calculated volume of 1x PBS to
give a final concentration of 5 % liver (W/W) was added to each of the twelve tubes. All
samples were homogenized using a Biorad Fast prep System. The resulting homogenate
solutions were combined to give about 12 ml of 5 % liver homogenate in 1x PBS which was
subsequently used for incubation.
        [00260] Plasma was Na-Citrate plasma from female NMRI mouse (Charles River) K
EDTA plasma from male Cynomolgous monkey (Seralab International).
        [00261] Four samples of each oligo were prepared representing each individual
incubation time point (0, 7, 24 and 48 h) in mouse and monkey plasma and in mouse liver
homogenate, respectively. In addition, a blank sample and a recovery sample were prepared of
each oligo and incubation matrix. Generally, plasma samples were prepared by adding 5 I of
the 600 pM oligo stock solution to 95 p1 of mouse or monkey plasma, respectively, with a final
oligo concentration of 30 pM. Recovery samples were prepared by adding 5 P1 of water to 95 P1
of plasma. Blank samples are oligo in water with a final concentration of 100 PM. Liver samples
and recoveries were prepared equally; apart from the fact that liver homogenate in PBS was used
instead of plasma.
Analysis of the study samples
        [00262] Samples were analyzed in 96-well plate format. A standard curve with 8
standards (5, 10, 15, 20, 50, 75, 90, 100 pg/ml; 25 pg/ml IS), a standard 0 (0 pg/ml; 25 Pg/ml
IS) and three recovery samples (20, 50, 100 pg/ml; 25 pg/ml IS) has been prepared for each
oligo. Samples and standards of one particular oligo were analyzed together on the same plate.
        [00263] Standards were prepared as follows. A piece of approximately 50 mg of tissue
was cut from the respective organ tissue, weighted and placed into the respective well of a 2.2
ml 96-deepwell plate (VWR 732-0585). Two steel balls (5 mm diameter, KGM Kugelfabrik
GmbH, part # 1.3541) were placed into each well and 500 p1 homogenization buffer (vide infra),
20 p1 DTT (1 M, Sigma 43816), 50 p1 of proteinase K solution (Qiagen, 19133) was added.
Furthermore, 10 p1 working solution analyte and 10 p1 working solution internal standard was
added into each well of the standards to give the corresponding final concentrations of (5, 10,

15, 20, 50, 75, 90, 100 pg/ml; 25 pg/ml IS). Standard 0 and recoveries were spiked with 10 P1
working solution internal standards only; recoveries were spiked with 10 P1 working solution
analyte after the entire extraction process and prior to analysis.
        [00264] A piece of approximately 50 mg of tissue was cut from the respective organ
tissue, weighted and placed into the respective well of a 96-deepwell plate. Two steel balls were
placed into each well and 500 p1 homogenization buffer 20 p1 DTT (1 M), 50 P1 of proteinase K
solution was added. The plate was sealed with STAR lab foils (StarLab E 2796 3070) and
samples are homogenized using a Qiagen Tissue Lyzer for 3x 30 s at 17 Hz. Subsequently the
plate was incubated in a water bath for 2 h at 55 'C followed by transfer of the samples to a new
96-deepwell plate using an automated liquid-handling system (TomTec Quadra 3). After the
addition of 200 p1 ammonium hydroxide (25 %) and 500 p1 Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl alcohol
(25:24:1) the plate was vortexed using a Multitubevortex for 5 min. Subsequently, the plate was
incubated for 10 min at 4 'C and centrifuged at 4 'C for another 10 min at 3500 RCF. The plate
was then handled to the TomTec System which was used to remove the aqueous layer. The
remaining organic layer was washed by adding 500 p1 water. The aqueous phase was again
removed using the TomTec system. The aqueous phases were combined, 50 P1 HCl (1 N), 500
p1 SAX Load High buffer (vide infra) and 300 p1 acetonitrile was added and the resulting
solution was mixed thoroughly by up and down pipetting using the TomTec system. ('The
program "SPE extraction of tissue samples 100416" was used for the subsequent solid-phase
extraction procedure).
        [00265] Briefly: VARIAN Bond Elute 96 square-well SAX 100 mg (Cat. No.
A39608 IC) were equilibrated with acetonitrile, water and SAX load buffer (see below), samples
were load and washed with SAX load buffer. The samples were eluted with SAX elute buffer
(vide infra) and subsequently diluted with SAX/RP dilution buffer (vide infra). WATERS Oasis
HLB LP 96-well Plate 60 pm 60 mg (Part No.: 186000679) were equilibrated with acetonitrile,
water and SAX dilution buffer (vide infra). The samples were load and the cartridge washed

        [00266] Freeze the elution plate for 1 h at -80 'C and lyophilize to dryness. The dried
samples are reconstituted in 50 p1 water and dialyzed for 60 min against water using Thermo
Slide-A-Lyzer. The samples were then subjected to CGE analysis on a Beckman Coulter
PACE/MDQ system. The conditions were: (i) Capillary: eCAP DNA, neutral, 21 cm, 100 Pm

        [00267] All samples and recoveries were incubated at 37 'C. A sample of each oligo and
type of matrix was cooled to room temperature after 0, 7, 24 and 48 h and was subjected to
Phenol/Chloroform purification. To this end, 370 p1 of ammonium hydroxide (15 %), 10 p1
dithiothreitole (DTT, 1 M, Sigma 43816) and 800 p1 premixed Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl
alcohol (Sigma P2069) was added to each sample. The sample was vortexed for 10 min at
maximum vortex speed and then incubated at 4 'C for 20 min. Subsequently, the sample was
centrifuged at 3500 RFC for 20 min at 4 'C and 400 p1 of the aqueous layer were removed and
dried in a lyophilizer. The dried samples were dissolved in water (100       l). The recovery samples
were dissolved in water (95    l) and spiked with 5    l of the respective oligo stock solution (600
pM). Samples were analyzed by LC-MS (Agilent 1200, Bruker Esquire 3000) using a Waters
Acquity UPLC OST C18 column (1.7 pm, 2.1x50) with HFIP/TEA/water (385 mM 1,1,1,3,3,3
hexafluoroisopropanol, 14.4 mM triethylamine in water) as buffer A and methanol as buffer B
and a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min at a column temperature of 60 'C. The following gradient was
used: 3 min at 5% B, 5-15% B in 2.5 min (10%/min), 15-23% B in 5.5 min, 23-30% B in 3 min,
30-100% B in 0.5 min, 5 min at 100 % B, 100-5% B in 0.5 min, 5 min at 5 % B.
        [00268] Surprisingly, the levels of dimers in the liver (organ target for ApoB and
ApoC3) and kidney were dramatically increased after a single i.v. bolus injection. It was found
that about 10 to 16% monomeric metabolite of the total dose in liver 24 hours after injection of
the dimers (Table 5), while previously it was known that only 2 to 5% of the total dose of the
monomeric 14-mer (SEQ ID NO: 1)) in mice or monkeys (Table 6) was detected in a separate
study. Accordingly, dimers exhibited significantly higher biodistribution to liver and kidney as
compared to the monomers. Table 5 shows organ-distribution of antisense dimers SEQ ID NO:2,
3 and 4 as percent of total administered dose 24 hrs after a single i.v. bolus injection into mice.

        [00269] The high levels of the monomeric equivalent (peak 1) were very surprising,
since most of the injected dimer was already processed to a monomeric form (left peak 1 with
shortest retention time, as shown in Figure 6). In the case of dimer of SEQ ID NO:2, the intact
dimer was detected at 6.458 min), as well as the monomer and the monomer with an additional
dT (SEQ ID NO: 1 plus dT) from the incomplete cleavage of the linker. The internal standard

(IS) is poly-(dT) 30 phosphorothioate. The dimers SEQ ID NOs:4 and 2 were already completely
converted to the monomeric forms comprising the monomer (SEQ ID NO: 1) and the monomer
plus dT. In case of dimer SEQ ID NO:3 with a disulfide linker, the monomeric cleavage product
was slightly larger than monomer resulting from reductive disulfide cleavage and is indicated as
"#1 plus X" in the figure, where X is a yet unidentified organic radical with the molecular
weight of less 100 Da. It could be hypothesized that that "#1 plus X" results from oxidative
cleavage rather than reductive cleavage of the disulfide bond. If the dimers had been already
cleaved in the serum, the bio-distribution to liver and kidneys should not have increased so
dramatically as compared to monomers. Thus, the stability of the dimers in plasma and in liver
homogenates was investigated. It was demonstrated in Example 3 that plasma stability of the
dimers is relatively high over 48 hours, while the dimers are rapidly cleaved in liver
homogenates. Further cleavage product analysis of samples extracted from the liver homogenate
treatment showed that the dimer is completely converted to the monomeric form. This
observation is compatible with a bio-distribution mechanism, in which dimers are relatively
stable after injection into animal. The dimers distributed more efficiently to the organs like liver
and kidney as opposed to the corresponding monomer. In the organs (e.g., liver and kidney), the
dimer is cleaved to the monomer and can act as a normal antisense oligonucleotide. Since the
dimers are stable in serum (plasma), the linkers can be designed to undergo an organ-specific
cleavage by using appropriate linker chemistry.
Example 15: In Vivo Activity Assessment of a Cleavable ApoC3/ApoB ASO Heterodimer
         [00270] In vivo activity of a heterodimer of a human ApoC3 ASO linked to an ApoB
ASO with a cleavable linker was assessed in male and female human ApoC3 transgenic mice
which were 14-18 weeks old at termination.
         [00271] The ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer (SEQ ID NO: 21) or a non-targeting ASO
(SEQ ID NO: 119) were formulated in sterile saline (pH7.0) immediately before intravenous (iv)
injection via the tail vein. Animals were administered heterodimer (0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg) or
negative control ASO (10 mg/kg) or saline (0 mg/kg) as a vehicle control in a volume of 5
ml/kg.
         [00272] Groups of mice consisted of 2 male and 2 female transgenic mice which were
terminated on days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 29 after treatment administration. After euthanasia by CO 2
inhalation, blood was obtained by cardiac puncture (0.5-1 ml). Livers were dissected, weighed,
and a fragment saved in a labeled histology cassette snap frozen by immersion in liquid
nitrogen. Liver samples were maintained at -80'C for subsequent analyses.

        [00273] Each blood sample was divided in half. Serum was prepared in serum separator
tubes which were allowed to clot for 4 hours on ice. Plasma was prepared in EDTA-containing
tubes which were maintained on ice until processed. Tubes were spun at 10,000 rpm for 5 min
at 4'C and supernatants collected and frozen at -80'C for future analyses.
Quantification of target mRNAs
        [00274] Total liver RNA was isolated in TRIzol reagent (Ambion) from snap frozen
tissue homogenized in Fastprep24 Lysing Matirx D tubes (MP Biomedicals). Trizol-chloroform
extraction was followed by further purification using a column-based method (Qiagen, RNeasy)
as per manufacturer's instruction. Purification included treatment with DNase I for 15 minutes
at room temperature (Qiagen, Rnase-Free Dnase). RNA quantity and purity were evaluated
spectophotometrically by readings at 260 nm and 280 nm (Nanodrop). Liver fragments were
lysed with RLT buffer and QlAshredder columns (Qiagen), and then purified by RNeasy
columns as indicated above.
        [00275] Samples were amplified as per manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Quantitect
Probe RT-PCR kit). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed in a 7900HT Fast
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). All samples were analyzed in triplicate in
Microamp Optical 384well reaction plates (Applied Biosystems) and normalized with Gapdh
signal as the internal control. Primers were Apolipoprotein C-III (Applied Biosystems,
Mm00445670_ml and HsOO163644_ml), Apolipoprotein B (Applied Biosystems,
Mm01545156_ml and HsO1071209_ml), and Mouse GAPDH (Applied Biosystems,
4352932E). Results are expressed as fold induction relative to vehicle-treated samples.
        [00276] Data for each of the target mRNAs were analyzed by two-way ANOVA using
"time" and "treatment" as the variables in GraphPad Prism software. Bonferroni post-hoc tests
were conducted when significant main effects (p < 0.05) were observed.
        [00277] The results of this in vivo experiment are shown in Figures 7A and 7B. The
data demonstrate that SEQ ID NO: 21, an ApoC3/ApoB heterodimer ASO with an endonuclease
sensitive phosphodiester linker, significantly down-regulated liver expression of both target
mRNAs [i.e, human APOC3 (Figure 7A) and mouse ApoB (Figure 7B)]. Target mRNA
knockdown was dependent on both administered dose and time. That is, in animals which
received more ASO construct, a greater target knockdown was observed. The greatest degree of
knockdown for any dose level was observed during the first week post-administration, with
significant effects persisting until 29 days post-administration, the longest time point at which
samples were obtained.

Example 16: In Vivo Comparison of Heterodimer ASOs and Monomers: Effects on Target
mRNAs
          [00278] In vivo activity of three heterodimers of a human ApoC3 ASO linked to an
ApoB ASO, the ApoC3 ASO monomer, the ApoB ASO monomer and the physical combination
of the two monomers was assessed in male human ApoC3 transgenic mice which were 9-18
weeks old at termination.
          [00279] An ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable;
SEQ ID NO: 21), or an ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases
(stable; SEQ ID NO: 59), or an ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with PEG-6 (stable; SEQ
ID NO: 60), or the ApoC3 monomer ASO (SEQ ID NO: 30), or the ApoB monomer ASO (SEQ
ID NO: 13), or the physical combination of the ApoC3 and ApoB monomers (SEQ ID NO: 30
plus SEQ ID NO: 13), or a non-targeting ASO (SEQ ID NO: 119) were formulated in sterile
SALINE (pH7.0) immediately before intravenous (iv) injection via the tail vein. Animals were
administered equal molar amounts of heterodimer (0.3 pMol/kg ~ 3 mg/kg), monomer (0.3
pMol/kg ~ 1.3 mg/kg), co-formulated monomers (0.3 pMol/kg each) or negative control ASO
(0.3 pMol/kg ~ 1.4 mg/kg) or SALINE (0 mg/kg) as a vehicle control at a volume of 5 ml/kg.
          [00280] Groups consisted of 6-7 male transgenic mice which were terminated 3 or 14
days after treatment administration. After euthanasia by CO 2 inhalation, blood was obtained by
cardiac puncture (0.5-1 ml). Livers were dissected, weighed, and a fragment put in a labeled
histology cassette snap frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Whole kidneys were also stored
in labeled histology cassettes and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Liver and kidney samples were
maintained at -80'C for subsequent analyses.
          [00281] Each blood sample was divided in half. Serum was prepared in serum separator
tubes which were allowed to clot for 4 hours on ice. Plasma was prepared in EDTA-containing
tubes which were maintained on ice until processed. Tubes were spun at 10,000 rpm for 5 min
at 4'C and supernatants collected and frozen at -80'C for future analyses.
          [00282] Data for each of the target mRNAs on either Day 3 or Day 14 were analyzed by
one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post-hoc test to determine differences between
treatments using GraphPad Prism software.
          [00283] The effects of these treatments on in vivo target mRNAs in the liver are shown
in Figures 8A and 8B. Data in these figures are plotted as % knockdown of the target mRNAs
with knockdown of mouse apoB mRNA plotted on the x axis and knockdown of human ApoC3
(i.e., the transgene) plotted on the y axis. The data demonstrate that SEQ ID NO: 21, an

superior to all other treatments on both day 3 (Figure 8A) and day 14 (Figure 8B) in the extent
to which it down-regulated liver expression of both target mRNAs.
         [00284] On day 3 (Figure 8A), ApoB mRNA in the liver was significantly decreased by
all treatments, except the ApoC3-targeted ASO monomer (SEQ ID NO: 30) and the negative
control ASO (SEQ ID NO: 119). In general, the effectiveness of constructs given on day 0 to
suppress target mRNAs was weaker 14 days after treatment administration than observed 3 days
post-treatment. Nevertheless, ApoB mRNA in the liver (Figure 8B) was suppressed by all
treatments except the ApoC3-targeted ASO monomer (SEQ ID NO: 30), the ApoC3/ApoB ASO
heterodimer linked with PEG-6 (stable; SEQ ID NO: 60, and the negative control ASO (SEQ ID
NO: 119). Importantly, treatment with SEQ ID NO: 21, an ApoC3/ApoB heterodimer ASO
with an endonuclease sensitive phosphodiester linker resulted in significantly greater
knockdown of liver ApoB mRNA than any other treatment at each of the times at which samples
were taken (Figures 8A and 8B).
         [00285] Qualitatively similar results were observed for knockdown of human ApoC3
mRNA in these human ApoC3 transgenic mice. On Day 3 (Figure 8A), the ApoC3 monomer
(SEQ ID NO: 30), the physical combination of the ApoC3 and Apo B monomers (SEQ ID NO:
30 plus SEQ ID NO: 13), the ApoB monomer (SEQ ID NO: 13), and the ApoC3/ApoB ASO
heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21) significantly decreased
expression of human ApoC3 mRNA. On Day 14 (Figure 8B), only the ApoC3/ApoB ASO
heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21) significantly suppressed
expression of human ApoC3. Similar to its effectiveness in suppressing ApoB, administration
of SEQ ID NO: 21 resulted in significantly greater knockdown of liver human ApoC3 mRNA
expression than any other treatment (Figures 8A and 8B).
Example 17: Tissue Stability of Heterodimer ASOs
         [00286] Hybridization assays were developed (see below) to measure the tissue
concentrations of the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable;
SEQ ID NO: 21), the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases
(stable; SEQ ID NO: 59), and the ApoB monomer ASO (SEQ ID NO: 13) in plasma and
homogenates of liver and kidney. Samples from the experiment described in Example 16 were
measured.

         [00287] Complementary hybridization probes to the hetero-dimeric ASOs were designed
and custom synthesized with LNA-modified phosphodiester backbones (BioSpring GmbH).

The capture probes contained an amino linker (C 12-amino) and Spacer-18s
(hexaethyleneglycole phosphate, PEG-282) at the 5'-end. The detection probes contain Spacer

Tissue sample preparation:
        [00290] Liver and kidney homogenate was prepared from animals treated with
heterodimeric or monomeric ASOs. Tissue samples collected at specified time points were
                                               104

     WO 2013/040429                                                           PCT/US2012/055535
minced and weighed in ready-to-use Lysing Matrix D tubes containing 1.4 mm ceramic spheres
beads (Catalogue# 6913-100, MP Biomedicals). DNase/RNAse free water (Catalogue #
SH30538.02, Thermo) was added to the tube with ratio of 5 or 10 mL per g of tissue. Each tissue
sample was mixed and homogenized using a MP Biomedicals Fast Prep-24 at 4 'C for 20
seconds twice. The tissue homogenate was stored in freezer or kept on ice before analyzed with
the hybridization assay.
Preparation of standards and controls:
         [00291] Standards and assay quality controls (QCs) were prepared in K2 EDTA plasma
or control tissue matrix and diluted serially in 2-fold steps from 100 ng/mL to 0.098 ng/mL. The
QCs were set at 50 ng/mL, 40 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL, 1 ng/mL and 0.4 ng/mL. The standards and
QCs were analyzed by the hybridization assay with the samples.
Hybridization methods with colorimetric detection:
         [00292] DNA-Bind plates (96-well) (Catalogue #2505, Costar) were coated overnight at
4 'C with 100 [tL of 50 nM capture probes in HEPES/1mM Na 2 EDTA buffer. The plates were
then washed three times with wash buffer (Tris Buffer/0. 1% Tween 20) and incubated in
blocking buffer (PBS/3% BSA) for 1-2 hrs. 30 pL of Samples, Standards, and QCs were mixed
with 270 pL of 50 nM detection probe in hybridization buffer (4X SSC/0.5% Sarkosyl) in
Costar cluster tubes and two 100 pL aliquots from the mixture were transferred into 96-well
PCR plate and denatured on the thermocycler for 12.5 minutes at 95 'C. After the samples were
cooled to 40 'C, they were transferred to DNA-Bind plate already coated with capture probe.
The plate was sealed and incubated at 40 'C for two hours. Following the hybridization, Poly
HRP Streptavidin conjugate (Catalogue # N200, Thermo) at 1:10,000 dilution in Poly -HRP
dilution buffer (Catalogue # N500, Thermo) was added. Color development was initiated by
adding SureBlue TMB substrate (Catalogue #52-00-00, KPL) and stopped with stop reagent for
TMB substrate (Catalogue # S5814, Sigma).
Results:
         [00293] The ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable;
SEQ ID NO: 21) or the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases
(stable; SEQ ID NO: 59) were spiked into liver or kidney (n = 2 each) and homogenized as
described above. The homogenate was divided into two aliquots. One of the aliquots was
stored at -80 0C, the other aliquot was placed at 37 0C for 15 hours before storage at -80 0C. The
two aliquots were thawed and analyzed together for the concentration of heterodimeric ASOs
and apoB monomer with the hybridization assay.

     WO 2013/040429                                                         PCT/US2012/055535
        [00294] As shown in Figures 9A and 9B, concentrations of both heterodimers were
lower after overnight incubation at 37 0C, suggesting degradation in tissue at physiological
temperature. The ApoB monomer ASO was detectable as a metabolite in both liver and kidney
samples spiked with the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases
(cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21) and the levels were more than 5 fold higher in samples incubated at
37 0C. After spiking with the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate
bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59), the ApoB monomer ASO was only detectable in liver
homogenates which had been frozen. Taken together, the data suggest that SEQ ID NO: 21 is
degraded to active ApoB monomer (SEQ ID NO: 13) metabolite more readily from the
ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (SEQ ID NO: 21) than from the
ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59).
Example 18: In Vivo Distribution of Heterodimer ASOs and ApoB Monomer ASO
        [00295] In plasma, heterodimer ASOs and the ApoB monomer were measured using the
methods above in 2 pools of 3 individuals each after treatment with the ApoC3/ApoB ASO
heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21), the ApoC3/ApoB ASO
heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59), the ApoB
monomer ASO (SEQ ID NO: 13) or the physical combination of the ApoC3 and ApoB
monomer ASOs (SEQ ID NO: 30 plus SEQ ID NO: 13).            As shown in Figure 10, both
heterodimer ASOs were detected in plasma 3 days post-treatment. ApoB monomer was also
detected 3 days after treatment with the ApoB monomer ASO alone or in physical combination
with the ApoC3 monomer. However, ApoB monomer ASO was detected as a metabolite of the
ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21) 3
days after treatment, but not after administration of the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked
with four phosphothioate bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59), demonstrating that the endonuclease
sensitive linker resulted in enhanced metabolism to active ASO monomers. None of the
analytes were detected in plasma pools taken 14 days after treatment.
        [00296] Differences between heterodimer or monomer concentrations in tissues were
determined statistically by unpaired t-test (heterodimers) or one-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons (monomers) using GraphPad Prism.
        [00297] In the kidney, measured concentrations of all administered constructs and the
ApoB monomer metabolite decrease significantly between 3 and 14 days after administration.
The decline in the concentrations of the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester
bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21) is the most rapid/marked, which is compatible with the
                                                 106

     WO 2013/040429                                                         PCT/US2012/055535
hypothesis that the construct is most vulnerable to metabolism via cleavage of the linker (see
Figures 11A and 11B).       On both day 3 and day 14, levels of the ApoB monomer are lowest
after administration of the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate
bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59) while the levels of intact SEQ ID NO: 59 are the highest of the
constructs measured. Taken together, these observations demonstrate slower metabolism of the
relatively stable phosphothioate linker.
         [00298] In liver, the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases
(cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21) was present at lower concentrations than the ApoC3/ApoB ASO
heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59) after treatment with
the respective constructs (see Figures 12A and 12B), demonstrating that SEQ ID NO: 21 is
metabolized more quickly in liver. Monomer levels that were measured on day 3 and 14 were
significantly lower after administration of the ApoB monomer (SEQ ID NO: 13) either alone or
in physical combination with the ApoC3 monomer than after administration of with either of the
measured heterodimer of ApoC3/ApoB ASOs. On day 3, the concentration of ApoB monomer
present in the liver as a metabolite after heterodimer administration was significantly higher
after administration of the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases
(cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21) than the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four
phosphothioate bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59), substantiating that the linker designed for
cleavage by endonucleases resulted in higher concentration of active monomeric ASO
metabolite within a few days of administration (see Figure 12A). On day 14, the reverse was
observed (see Figure 12B). The concentration of ApoB monomer present in the liver as a
metabolite after heterodimer administration was significantly higher after administration of the
ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59)
than the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO:
21). Since the phosphothioate linked heterodimer also degrades in tissue, albeit at a slower rate,
relatively more monomer is present at this time point. The levels of ApoB monomer, after its
administration or as a metabolite of administered ASO heterodimers is related to target mRNA
knockdown, e.g., the highest levels of ApoB monomer are present after administration of the
ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21) and
the highest level of target mRNA knockdown is also observed in this treatment group (compare
Figures 12A and 12B to Figures 8A and 8B)

          [00299] 15-mer gapmer oligos were designed as single monomers or as homodimers
(30-mers) linked by an oligo-dT linker (4 bases) via cleavable phosphodiester bonds. The oligos
were designed to target either miR- 122 or MALAT- 1 and consisted of three LNA-modified
bases at each end of the monomer with 9 unmodified DNA bases in the center or gap region.
The gapmer design facilitated cleavage of the bound target mRNA by RNAseH resulting in a

Animal care and treatments:
          [00300] Animal experiments were conducted in an Association for the Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) facility under a constant light-dark cycle,
maintained on a standard mouse diet, and allowed ad libitum access to food and water. Mice
were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation. All mouse experiments were approved and conducted in
compliance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
Vivisource Laboratories, Inc. Female C57BL6/J mice were obtained from the Jackson
Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine) and female Balb/C mice obtained from the Charles River
Laboratories. Oligonucleotides were dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and
administered to mice based on body weight by subcutaneous injection. Mice were injected once
per week (MALAT-1) at 50mg/kg or twice per week (MIR-122) at 10mg/kg or 50mg/kg. Mice
were sacrificed after one week and at study termination (four weeks) and liver, kidney and
plasma harvested for further analysis.

RNA isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and miRNEasy columns (Qiagen). RNA concentration
was assessed using RlboGreen plates (Molecular Probes) and a Molecular Dynamics M5
multimodal plate reader. 250 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamers in
a 50ml reaction using High Capacity Multiscribe Reverse Transcriptase. qPCR was carried out
using the equivalent of 12.5ng cDNA in 20pl reaction volumes using MIR122 or MALAT-1
specific TaqMan primers and probes on a Step-One Plus thermocycler. Relative qPCR
expression of individual genes was normalized to the expression of reference genes GusB

miR-122 Study Results
        [00303] Two separate cohorts of C57B16/J mice (short and long dosing arm) were
analyzed. The mice were females and, both cohorts were maintained on regular chow. Both
cohorts were dosed at 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection twice a week (day 1
and 4). Targeting oligonucleotides used were 15 base gapmers with LNA at the ends (3-9-3)
and full phosphorothioate linkage. Animals were euthanized at day 7 (short arm) and day 28
(long arm). Dose Groups were n=5. The following parameters were analyzed in an ex vivo
analysis: ALT, total cholesterol, triglycerides by ELISA.
        [00304] As depicted in Figures 13A and 13B, oligonucleotides targeting miR-122
decreased target miRNA in vivo by 75-90% compared to PBS treated controls. Monomers
exhibited 75% knockdown of miR-122; whereas dimers caused 90% knockdown of miR-122.
        [00305] As depicted in Figures 14A and 14B, 50mg/kg dose of oligonucleotides
targeting miR-122 decreased target miRNA in vivo by 90-95% compared to PBS treated
controls.  Monomers exhibited 90% knockdown of miR-122; whereas dimers caused 95%
knockdown of miR-122. It was noted that monomer at 50mg/kg is equivalent to dimer at
10mg/kg for % miR-122 knockdown.
        [00306] As illustrated in Figure 15, in vivo results show that dimers at 10mg/kg exhibits
similar knockdown as monomer at 50mg/kg. Thus, dimer oligonucleotides are ~ 5x more active
than monomer (in vivo 7d study).

MALAT-1 Study Results
         [00307] Female Balb/c mice which were 7 weeks at shipment were evaluated (N=5).
The mice were dosed at 50mg/kg on Thursday, and takedown was at 5 days post-dose.           Sample
obtained from the mice included tserum, kidney, brain, and liver. Organs with high levels of
MALAT-1 are heart, kidney, brain and minimally found in spleen and skeletal muscle. qRT
PCR was performed to evaluate Malat-1 knockdown. As depicted in Figures 16A-16C, dimer
oligonucleotides robustly decreased Malat-1 IncRNA expression; where the control GusB gene
was unaffected.
