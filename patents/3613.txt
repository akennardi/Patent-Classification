   which are incorporated herein by reference.
   RELATED APPLICATION
 5 This application claims priority to, and the benefits of, U.S. Provisional Application Serial
   No. 61/972,972, filed March 31, 2014. The entire content of which is incorporated by
   reference herein.
   FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
   The present disclosure relates to compounds capable of modulating the activity of histone
10 demethylases (HDMEs), which compounds are useful for the prevention and/or the
   treatment of diseases in which genomic dysregulation is involved in the pathogenesis, such
   as e.g. cancer.
   BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
   The DNA of eukaryotic cells is packaged into chromatin by winding of the DNA around
15 histone proteins to form nucleosomes, the basic unit of chromatin. One of the important
   functions of chromatin is to determine regions of active and silenced transcription by
   changing the ordered chromatin structure. Such changes have profound effects on cellular
   function since they affect fundamental processes as differentiation, proliferation and
   apoptosis, and are often referred collectively to as "epigenetic" since they can lead to
20 heritable changes that do not involve changes in gene sequences (Quina, A.S. et al. (2006),
   Biochem. Pharmacol. 72; 1563-1569).
   These highly controlled chromatin changes are mediated by alterations histone proteins
   associated with DNA in the nucleosome. Most notably, the N-terminal histone tail of
   Histone H3 and histone H4 are subject to such covalent changes, which include changes in
25 methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination. The addition or removal of
   these groups on histones is mediated by specific enzymes, e.g. histone methyl transferases
   and histone demethylases for methyl groups, histone acetyltransferases and histone
   deacetylases for acetyl groups, etc. In the event that the activity or expression of these
   "epigenetic" enzymes is not correctly controlled and regulated it may lead to disease.
30 Cancer, in particular, is an area of high importance in relation to dysregulated epigenetic
   enzyme activity due to the role of epigenetics in cell differentiation, proliferation and
                                                               1

     WO 2015/153498                                                          PCT/US2015/023407
   apoptosis, but epigenetics may also play a role in other diseases like metabolic,
   inflammatory, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore the selective
   modulation of aberrant action of epigenetic enzymes may hold great promise for the
   treatment of human disease (Kelly, T.K. et al. (2010), Nat. Biotechnol. 28; 1069-1078, and
 5 Cloos, P.a.C. et al. (2008), Genes. Dev. 22; 1115-1140).
   Methylation and demethylation of lysine residues on the histone H3 tail constitute important
   epigenetic marks delineating transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin. For example,
   methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9) is usually associated with epigenetically
   silenced chromatin (Fischle, W., et. al. (2003), Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 15, 172-183;
10 Margueron, R., et al. (2005), Curr. Opinion Genet. Dev. 15, 163-176) while methylation of
   lysine 4 on histone 3 is associated with transcriptionally active chromatin. Similarly, the
   lysine 27 histone H3 (H3K27) mark is repressive in its di- and tri-methylated states whereas
   the lysine 36 histone H3 mark is found in association with gene activation (Barski, A. et al.
   (2007), Cell, 129, 823-837; Vakoc, C. et al. (2006) Mol. Cell. Biol. 26, 9185-9195; Wagner,
15 E.J. & Carpenter, P.B. (2012) Nature Mol. Cell Biol 13, 115-126). There are, however,
   many exemptions from these general rules of association between methylation states of
   epigenetic marks and the effect they have on transcription.
   As documented by studies of the SUV39H1 knockout mouse, loss of the tri-methyl variant
   of the H3K9 mark results in chromosomal aberrations and predisposes to cancer (Peters,
20 A.H. et al., Cell 107, 323-337, 2001). The JMJD2C protein (KDM4C, GASCI) has been
   identified as an eraser of the H3K9 mark (a histone demethylase) and may therefore
   promote cancer if its expression and activity is not tightly controlled (Cloos, P. et al. (2006),
   Nature 442, 307-311; Klose, R.J. et al. (2006), Nature 442, 312-316; Liu, G. et al. (2009),
   Oncogene 28, 4491-4500). For example, JMJD2C has been shown to induce transformed
25 phenotypes like growth factor independent growth, anchorage independent growth and
   mammosphere formation, if it is overexpressed in cells (Liu, G. et al. (2009), Oncogene 28,
   4491-4500). These findings are supported by the overexpression of JMJD2C in a range of
   human tumours like squamous cell carcinoma, metastatic lung carcinoma, prostate cancer,
   breast cancer and several others (Yang, Z.Q. et al. (2000) Cancer Res. 60, 4735-4739;

     WO 2015/153498                                                          PCT/US2015/023407
   65, 2542-2546; Liu, G. et al. (2009) Oncogene 28, 4491-4500; Wissmann, M. et al. (2007)
   Nat. Cell Biol. 9, 347-353), indicating the potential importance of JMJD2C as an oncogene.
   The JMJD2A protein (KDM4A, JHDM3A) shows similar properties to JMJD2C. JMJD2A
   shows high sequence identity to JMJD2C in its JmjC catalytic domain, is an eraser of the
 5 H3K9 mark and has also been shown to be overexpressed in prostate cancer (Cloos, P. Et
   al., Nature 442, 307-311, 2006). JMJD2A has been shown to interact with the estrogen
   receptor alpha (ER-alpha) and overexpression of JMJD2A enhances estrogen-dependent
   transcription and the down-regulation of JMJD2A reduced transcription of a seminal ER
   alpha target gene, cyclin D1 (Kawazu et al., (2011) PLoS One 6; Berry et al., (2012) Int J
10 Oncol 41). Additionally, it has been shown that catalytically inactive JMJD2A is
   compromised in its ability to stimulate ER-alpha mediated transcription, suggesting that
   inhibitors of JMJD2A may be beneficial for the treatment of ER-alpha positive breast
   tumours (Berry et al., (2012) Int J Oncol 41).
   Likewise, an eraser of the tri-methyl variant of the H3K4 mark, JARIDIB (KDM5B, PLU1)
15 has also been identified as potential oncogene. In cancer JARIDIB most likely acts as a
   repressor of tumour repressor genes via removal of the H3K4 tri-methylation leading to
   decreased transcriptional activation in the affected chromatin regions. The oncogenic
   potential of JARID 1B is demonstrated by its stimulation of proliferation in cell lines and
   further validated by shRNA knockdown studies of JARID1B expression showing inhibition
20 of proliferation in MCF7 human breast cancer cells, in SW780 and RT4 bladder cancer
   cells, in A549 and LC319 lung cancer cells and in 4T1 mouse tumour cells in vitro and/or in
   mouse xenograft experiments (Yamane K. et al. (2007), Mol. Cell 25, 801-812; Hayami S.
   et al. (2010) Mol. Cancer 9, 59; Catchpole S et al. (2011), Int. J. Oncol. 38, 1267-1277).
   Finally, JARIDIB is overexpressed in prostate cancer and is associated with malignancy
25 and poor prognosis (Xiang Y. et al. (2007) PNAS 104).
   JARID1A (KDM5A, RBP2) is also an eraser of the tri- and di-methyl variant of the H3K4
   mark. JARID1A is overexpressed in gastric cancer (Zeng et al., (2010) Gastroenterology
    138) and its gene is amplified in cervix carcinoma (Hidalgo et al, (2005) BMC Cancer 5). It
   has been suggested that JARID1A is fine-tuning progesterone receptor expression control
30 by estrogens (Stratmann and Haendler (2011) FEBS J 278). Together with JARIDIB,
                                                   3

     WO 2015/153498                                                          PCT/US2015/023407
   JARID1A has been implicated in the maintenance of a slow-growing population of cancer
   cells that are required for continuous tumor growth and that are resistant to cytotoxic and
   targeted therapy (Roesch, et al, (2010) Cell 141; Sharma, et al., (2010) Cell 141). JARID1A
   is required for the tumor initiation and progression in Rb+/- and Menl -defective mice (Lin,
 5 et al., (2011) PNAS 108). Data from Pasini show that JARID1A binds to Polycomb group
   protein target genes which are involved in regulating important cellular processes such as
   embryogenesis, cell proliferation, and stem cell self-renewal through the transcriptional
   repression of genes determining cell fate decisions (Pasini et al., (2008) Genes & Dev 22).
   Additionally, JARID 1A were also shown to binds the PRC2 complex and being regulator of
10 PRC2 target genes (Pasini et al., (2008) Genes & Dev 22).
   Another potential oncogene, an eraser of the di-methyl variant of the H3K36 mark,
   JHDMlB (KDM2B, FBXL10) has been shown to be highly expressed in human cancers
   (Tzatsos A et al. (2009), PNAS 106 (8), 2641-2646; He, J. et al. (2011), Blood 117 (14),
   3869-3880). Knock-down of FBXL1O causes senescence in mouse embryonic fibroblasts
15 (MEFs), which can be rescued by expression of catalytic active (but not catalytic inactive)
   JHDMlB (Pfau, R et al. (2008), PNAS 105(6), 1907-1912; He, J et al. (2008), Nat Struct
   Mol Biol 15, 1169-1175). JHDMlB demethylates H3K36me2 on the tumor-suppressor gene
   Ink4b (p15 1"4b), and thereby silences the expression of this senescence-mediating gene in
   MEFs and in leukemic cells (He, J. et al. (2008), Nat Struct Mol Biol 15, 1169-1175; He, J.
20 et al. (2011), Blood 117 (14), 3869-3880). The catalytic dependency of JHDMlB is further
   shown by He et al. as catalytic activity is required for development of leukemia in a mouse
   AML model.
   Inhibitors of the histone demethylase class of epigenetic enzymes, and in particular the
   potential oncogenes JARIDIB, JARID1A, JMJD2C, JMJD2A, and JHDMlB, would
25 present a novel approach for intervention in cancers and other proliferative diseases. Being
   one of the most devastating diseases, affecting millions of people worldwide, there remains
   a high need for efficacious and specific compounds against cancer.

20 R    substituents together with the intervening -O-CH(-)-O- may form a heterocyclyl
   optionally substituted with one or more R3.
   It is to be understood that it is generally preferred that in the Formula (I), Y is not H when A
   is -CH 2-. Generally speaking, it is believed to be advantageous if the moiety -A-Y has a
   certain "size" with respect to the number of atom (disregarding hydrogen atoms) and/or the
25 molecular weight. Also a limited flexibility of the moiety -A-Y appears to play a certain
   role.
   Hence, it is believed that the moiety -A-Y should preferably consist of at the most 40 heavy
   atoms, such as at the most 30 heavy atoms, or at the most 25 heavy atoms, or at the most 20
   heavy atoms. Preferably, the moiety -A-Y will consist of at least 3, or at least 4, or at least 8

   or at least 10 heavy atoms. In some embodiments, the moiety -A-Y preferably consists of
   3-40 heavy atoms, such as 4-30 heavy atoms, or 4-25 heavy atoms, or 4-20, or 8-30, or 8
   20, or 8-15 heavy atoms. By the term "heavy atom" is meant all atoms in the moiety except
   the hydrogen atom(s).
 5
   Moreover, it is believed that the compounds of Formula (I) should preferably have a
   molecular weight of at least 130, or at least 150, or at least 180, or at least 250, but not more
   than 1,000, or not more than 800, or not more than 500, or not more than 400 and may be
   within any range constructable from these preferred upper and lower limits, such as 130
10  1,000 g/mol, or 150-1,000 g/mol, such as 180-800 g/mol, e.g. 225-600 g/mol or 250-500
   g/mol, or 250 to 400.
   In some embodiments, and in order to introduce a limited flexibility of the moiety -A-Y, the
   moiety includes 1-4 rings, i.e. rings derived from cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, heterocyclyl,
   heteroaryl and/or aryl. In some variant, the moiety -A-Y includes 1-3 cyclic moieties
15 selected from monocylic cycloalkyl, monocyclic heterocyclyl, monocylic heteroaryl,
   dicyclic heteroaryl and monocyclic aryl. Small substituents such as alkyls groups or
   hydroxyl on alkyl chains also reduce flexibility and favor certain conformations.
   It may be preferable that if -A-Y does not include a ring, it includes at least one, for
   instance from I to 3, branches, each of which independently may be of from one heavy
20 atom to six heavy atoms, for instance from one to three heavy atoms, or from one to two
   heavy atoms. It is preferred that -A-Y should contain at least one hetero-atom, preferably
   at least one nitrogen atom or at least one oxygen.

15 Isomers
   The compounds of Formula (I) may exist as geometric isomers (i.e. cis-trans isomers),
   optical isomers or stereoisomers, such as diastereomers, as well as tautomers. Accordingly,
   it should be understood that the definition of compounds of Formula (I) includes each and
   every individual isomers corresponding to the structural formula: Formula (I), including cis
20 trans isomers, stereoisomers and tautomers, as well as racemic mixtures of these and
   pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Hence, the definition of compounds of Formula
   (I) is also intended to encompass all R- and S-isomers of a chemical structure in any ratio,
   e.g. with enrichment (i.e. enantiomeric excess or diastereomeric excess) of one of the
   possible isomers and corresponding smaller ratios of other isomers.
25 Diastereoisomers, i.e. non-superimposable stereochemical isomers, can be separated by
   conventional means such as chromatography, distillation, crystallization or sublimation. The
   optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to
   conventional processes, for example by formation of diastereoisomeric salts by treatment
   with an optically active acid or base. Examples of appropriate acids include, without
30 limitation, tartaric, diacetyltartaric, dibenzoyltartaric, ditoluoyltartaric and camphorsulfonic
                                                    59

   acid. The mixture of diastereomers can be separated by crystallization followed by
   liberation of the optically active bases from these salts. An alternative process for separation
   of optical isomers includes the use of a chiral chromatography column optimally chosen to
   maximize the separation of the enantiomers. Still another available method involves
 5 synthesis of covalent diastereoisomeric molecules by reacting compounds of Formula (I)
   with an optically pure acid in an activated form or an optically pure isocyanate. The
   synthesized diastereoisomers can be separated by conventional means such as
   chromatography, distillation, crystallization or sublimation, and then hydrolyzed to obtain
   the enantiomerically pure compound. The optically active compounds of Formula (I) can
10 likewise be obtained by utilizing optically active starting materials and/or by utilizing a
   chiral catalyst. These isomers may be in the form of a free acid, a free base, an ester or a
   salt. Examples of chiral separation techniques are given in Chiral Separation Techniques, A
   Practical Approach,     2 nd ed. by G. Subramanian, Wiley-VCH, 2001.
   General Synthetic Procedures
15 The compounds of this disclosure are prepared according to the following synthetic plans.
   In all these plans, protecting groups were used as required on peripheral functional groups.
   For  Q = COOH, these acids        can be obtained from hydrolysis of a corresponding alkyl ester.
   These alkyl esters were in turn obtained by a reductive amination of an aldehyde-amine or
20 ketone-amine pair.
   For  Q = CHO, these aldehydes were        obtained by oxidation of the corresponding primary
   alcohol or by reduction of the corresponding alkyl esters (vide supra). These primary
   alcohols were obtained either by reduction of the corresponding alkyl esters (vide supra) or
   by deprotection of the protected alcohol. The primary alcohols were in turn obtained by
25 reductive amination of an aldehyde-amine or ketone-amine pair bearing the alcohol.
   For  Q = CH=NR       , these imines were obtained by reacting the corresponding aldehyde with
   the appropriate primary amine H2NR 12
   For  Q = CHR2NR         R    , these amines by reductive amination of an aldehyde-amine or
   ketone-amine pair bearing the amine or were obtained by reductive amination of the
                                                      60

   aldehydes (vide supra) or ketones with the appropriate amine HNR2 R". The ketones were
   obtained by by reductive amination of an aldehyde-amine or ketone-amine pair bearing the
   ketone or by reaction of the corresponding aldehyde (vide supra) with a Grignard reagent of
   R 20 , followed by oxidation of the resulting secondary alcohol. If R13 is an acyl group, it
 5 may have to be introduced after the reductive amination step.
   For   Q = CH(OR17 )2 , these acetals were obtained by treatment of the aldehydes (vide supra)
   with the alcohol HOR".
   For   Q = W, these capped   heterocycles were obtained by reacting the corresponding
   heterocycles with an electrophilic form of Rio, such as an acid chloride, if Rio is not H.
10 These heterocycles were in turn obtained by reacting the aldehydes (vide supra), with the
   appropriate diamine, aminothiol or aminoalcohol under dehydrating conditions.
   Biological Assays
   Histone lysine demethylase AlphaLISA assays are performed to determine IC 50 values.

15 in vitro of tested enzymes. Assays are performed analogously to the protocol described by
   PerkinElmer (Roy et al. PerkinElmer Technical Note: AlphaLISA #12, Apr. 2011).

   value for endogenous protein, which may be used to demonstrate the ability of compounds
   of the disclosure to inhibit demethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 in a human cell line, such as
20 U2OS. Generally, the cells are incubated with compounds, washed and incubated with a
   methylation specific antibody before imaging. IC 50 values are determined by measurement
   of the H3K4me3 staining.
   Additional histone lysine demethylase immunofluorescence assays are performed to
   demonstrate the ability of the compounds of the disclosure to inhibit the activity of a
25 specific histone lysine demethylases overexpressed in a cell line. Cells ectopically

   determined by changes in the specific methylation state of specific histone lysine residues in
   the cells overexpressing the relevant histone lysine demethylase. Cell proliferation assays
   are performed to determine EC5 0 values, which may be used to demonstrate the ability of
   the compounds of the disclosure to inhibit the proliferation of a human cancer or other cell
 5 line. Generally, cells, such as MCF7 cells, are incubated with compounds for a certain time,
   such as 5 days. EC5 0 values are determined by life cell imaging or by tox assays, such the
   ATPlite 1 Step assay.
   Pharmaceutically acceptable salts
   The compound of Formula (I) may be provided in any form suitable for the intended
10 administration, in particular including pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and
   prodrugs of the compound of Formula (I).
   Pharmaceutically acceptable salts refer to salts of the compounds of Formula (I), which are
   considered to be acceptable for clinical and/or veterinary use. Typical pharmaceutically
   acceptable salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the compounds of Formula (I) a
15 mineral or organic acid or an organic or inorganic base. Such salts are known as acid
   addition salts and base addition salts, respectively. It will be recognized that the particular
   counter-ion or multiple counter-ions forming a part of any salt is not of a critical nature, so
   long as the salt as a whole is pharmaceutically acceptable and as long as the counter-ion
   does not contribute undesired qualities to the salt as a whole. These salts may be prepared
20 by methods known to the skilled person. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, e.g., those
   described and discussed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17. Ed. Alfonso R.
   Gennaro (Ed.), Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, U.S.A., 1985 and more recent
   editions and in Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology.
   Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts include acid addition salts formed
25 with inorganic acids e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, hydroiodic,
   metaphosphoric, or phosphoric acid; and organic acids e.g. succinic, maleic, acetic, fumaric,
   citric, tartaric, benzoic, trifluoroacetic, malic, lactic, formic, propionic, glycolic, gluconic,
   camphorsulfuric, isothionic, mucic, gentisic, isonicotinic, saccharic, glucuronic, furoic,
   glutamic, ascorbic, anthranilic, salicylic, phenylacetic, mandelic, embonic (pamoic),

   arylsulfonic, for example benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, oxalic, methanesulfonic or
   naphthalenesulfonic acid; and base addition salts formed with alkali metals and alkaline
   earth metals and organic bases such as N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine,
   choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine (N-methylglucamine), lysine and
 5 procaine; and internally formed salts.
   Solvates
   The compound of Formula (I) may be provided in dissoluble or indissoluble forms together
   with a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent such as water, ethanol, and the like. Dissoluble
   forms may also include hydrated forms such as the mono-hydrate, the dihydrate, the
10 hemihydrate, the trihydrate, the tetrahydrate, and the like.
   Isotopic variations
   Elemental symbols and element names are used herein to include isotopes of the named
   elements. In particular one, some, or all hydrogens may be deuterium. Radioactive
   isotopes may be used, for instance to facilitate tracing the fate of the compounds or their
15 metabolic products after administration.
   Prodrugs
   The compound of Formula (I) may be provided as a prodrug. The term "prodrug" used
   herein is intended to mean a compound which - upon exposure to certain physiological
   conditions - will liberate the compound of Formula (I) which then will be able to exhibit the
20 desired biological action. A typical example is a labile carbamate of an amine and a further
   example would be a trialkylsilyl ether of an alcohol or a trialkylsilyl ester of an acid, each
   optionally being trimethylsilyl.
   Inhibitory effect
   The inventors have surprisingly found that compounds of Formula (I) as defined herein
25 have an inhibitory effect on the activity of one or more HDMEs. In this respect said one or
   more HDMEs may be any HDME, however preferably the one or more HDMEs are
   selected from the JmjC (Jumonji) family, more preferably said one or more HDME(s) are
   HDME of the human JmjC family and even more preferably are HDME belonging to the
   KDM7, KDM6, KDM5, KDM4, KDM3 or KDM2 families, and most preferably said one or

   more HDME(s) are PHF8, KDM6A, KDM5A, KDM5B, KDM4A, KDM4C, KDM3A,
   KDM2A, and/or KDM2B. The present disclosure also relates to a compound of Formula (I)
   as defined herein in a method for inhibiting HDMEs. The method includes contacting a cell
   with a compound of Formula (I). In a related embodiment, the method further provides that
 5 the compound is present in an amount effective to produce a concentration sufficient to
   inhibit the demethylation of a histone in the cell.
   Thus, preferably in an assay for demethylation of a histone substrate by said HDME, then
   preferred compounds of Formula (I) are compounds capable of reducing or preferably
   inhibiting said demethylation by said HDME. Said histone substrate may be any histone,
10 but preferably is histone H3 or a fragment thereof, even more preferred: a fragment
   comprising K4, K9, K27, or K36 of H3. Preferably, said inhibition is determined as the IC 50
   of said compound of Formula (I) in respect of the said demethylation assay.
   Preferred compounds of Formula (I) which have an IC 50 at or below 1 piM, more preferably
   less than 300 nM, for example less than 100 nM, such as less than 50 nM in respect of
15 demethylation of any of said histone substrates by any of said HDME. Thus very preferred
   compounds of Formula (I) which have an IC 50 at or below 1 piM, more preferably less than
   500 nM, for example less than 100 nM, such as less than 50 nM in respect of demethylation
   of histone H3 methylated at least on one lysine.
   In a preferred embodiment IC 50 is determined as described in Example 2 herein below.
20 Thus, particularly preferred are compounds of Formula (I) which have an IC 50 at or below 1
   piM, more preferably less than 500 nM, for example less than 100 nM, such as less than 50
   nM when said IC 50 is determined as described in and one of the Examples herein below.
   Particularly preferred compounds of Formula (I) are compounds that lead to a decreased
   tumour size and/or decreased number of metastases when tested in a xenograft model
25 (Morton and Houghton, Nature Protocols, 2 (2) 247-250, 2007).

   readily administered in a variety of dosage forms such as tablets, powders, lozenges, syrups,
   suppositories, injectable solutions and the like. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided
   solid such as talc or starch which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component.
   In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding
15 properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.
   The pharmaceutical compositions may be specifically prepared for administration by any
   suitable route such as the oral and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular,
   intrathecal, intravenous and intradermal) route. It will be appreciated that the preferred route
   will depend on the general condition and age of the subject to be treated, the nature of the
20 condition to be treated and the active ingredient chosen.
   Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration include solid dosage forms such as
   capsules, tablets, dragees, pills, lozenges, powders and granules. Where appropriate, they
   can be prepared with coatings such as enteric coatings or they can be prepared so as to

Example 2: Histone lysine demethylase AlphaLISA assays for ICso value determination.
This example demonstrates the ability of compounds of the disclosure to inhibit the activity in
vitro of tested enzymes.
Assays are performed analogously to the protocol described by PerkinElmer (Roy et al.
PerkinElmer Technical Note: AlphaLISA #12, Apr. 2011).
General method
Enzymes (final assay concentration 0.1 - 2.5 nM) are dissolved in enzyme buffer and incubated
for 10 min before 5 gL is added to 5 gL 30%DMSO solutions of compounds in enzyme buffer,
incubated for another 10 minutes, before 5 gL substrate solution is added and the reaction
mixture is incubated at room temperature. 10 gL acceptor beads, suspended Epigenetic Buffer
(Perkin Elmer AL008) from stock, are added and the suspension is incubated in the dark at
room temperature, before 10 gL suspension of streptavidin donor beads (Perkin Elmer
6760002) in Epigenetic Buffer is added. After incubation at room temperature in the dark the
plates are read.

   General method
10 U20S cells are harvested and seeded into multi well plates into media containing
   compound. The media is DMEM containing 5 % FBS and pen/strep. 20 hours after
   incubation of cells with compounds, the cells are washed once in PBS, harvested by fixation
   with formaldehyde 4 % aqueous solution, and washed in PBS. Subsequently, the cells are
   permeabilized in PBS with 0.2 % Triton X-100. Blocking is performed in PBS with 0.2 %
15 Triton X-100 and 5 % FBS. The cells are incubated with aH3K4me3 primary antibody (Cell
   Signaling, #975 1S) in blocking solution over night at 4'C. After incubation with primary
   antibody, the cells are washed with PBS, incubated with secondary antibody (Alexa fluor
   594 goat anti rabbit IgG, Invitrogen, Al 1012) and Hoechst, (Sigma, 33342) in blocking

   This procedure may be used to demonstrate the ability of the compounds of the disclosure
10 to inhibit specific histone lysine demethylases expressed in a human osteosarcoma cell line.
   General method
   U20S cells are seeded 24 hours before transfection. Transfection is performed with Fugene
   HD transfection reagent as recommended by the manufacturer. 6 hours after transfection,
   the cells are harvested and seeded into multi well plates into media containing compound.
15 The media used is DMEM containing 10 % FBS and pen/strep. 20 hours after incubation of
   cells with compounds, the cells are washed in PBS, harvested by fixation with
   formaldehyde 4 % aqueous solution, and washed in PBS. Subsequently, the cells are
   permeabilized in PBS with 0.2 % Triton X-100 for. Blocking is performed in PBS with 0.2
   % Triton X-100 and 5 % FBS. The cells are incubated with primary antibodies in blocking
20 solution over night at 4'C. The primary antibodies used in the assays are HA. 11 (Covance,
   MMS-101P) and an antibody detecting the relevant mark. After incubation with primary
   antibodies, the cells are washed with PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa fluor
   594 goat anti rabbit IgG, Invitrogen, Al 1012; Alexa flour 488 donkey anti mouse IgG,
   Invitrogen, A21202) and Hoechst, (Sigma, 33342) in blocking solution, and washed again
25 with PBS. Finally, PBS is added and high throughput imaging and analysis are performed
   by an IN Cell Analyzer 1000 (GE Healthcare). The robot software analyzed individual cells
   and divided these into HA_ (transfected cells) and HA - (non-transfected cells). The IC 50
   values are based on an average measure of the staining of the mark specified in the table
   below in the transfected cells.

   This procedure may be used to demonstrate the ability of the compounds of the disclosure
   to inhibit the proliferation of a human breast cancer or other cancer cell line.
   General method
   MCF7 cells or other cancer cell line cells are seeded in multi well plates at a density
 5 optimized to give approximately 90% confluent cells at the time of harvest. Cells are
   incubated for 24 hours before addition of compound. Compounds are diluted in complete
   medium and added to the plates in duplicates. The final concentration of DMSO is
   maximum 0.5 %. Complete medium used is DMEM with GlutaMAX containing 10 % FBS
   and pen/strep.
10  120 hours after addition of compounds, the plates are harvested and analyzed by ATPlite 1
   Step (Perkin Elmer, cat no 6016739) according to the manufacturers' recommendation.
