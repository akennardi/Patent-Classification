                                      ABSTRACT
          A vehicle cab suspension is provided with a body having a mounting
  member positioned at least partially within the body. One or more resilient
  members connect the body to the mounting member and are placed in a
5 compressed condition between the body and the mounting member when the
  vehicle cab suspension is in an unloaded condition. The body may be formed of
  first and second body pieces, each of which may be provided with upper and/or
  lower projections to restrict movement of the resilient members during use.

                                        DESCRIPTION
   TECHNICAL FIELD
           The present subject matter relates to suspension systems for controlling
   movement of a vehicle cab with respect to the associated vehicle frame.
15
   BACKGROUND
           Applications calling for the use of heavy duty vehicles commonly result in
   significant vibrations and impacts applied to the vehicle. Suspension systems
   seek to prevent impact- or vibration-based damage to the vehicle, while providing
20 a smoother ride. However, additional consideration is needed to improve the
   comfort of a driver or passenger in the vehicle cab by isolating the driver or
   passenger from the vibrations and impacts. To that end, a number of vehicle cab
   suspension systems have been proposed. Examples of known vehicle cab
   suspension systems are described in greater detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,074,535
25 to Colford; 6,695,294 to Miller et al.; and 7,926,836 to Noble et al. and U.S. Patent
   Application Publication Nos. 2008/0136135 to Maciak and 2008/0157565 to
   Bakshi, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
                                          SUMMARY
30         There are several aspects of the present subject matter which may be
   embodied separately or together in the devices and systems described and
   claimed below. These aspects may be employed alone or in combination with
   other aspects of the subject matter described herein, and the description of these
   aspects together is not intended to preclude the use of these aspects separately
35 or the claiming of such aspects separately or in different combinations as set forth
                                              -1-

   in the claims appended hereto.
           In one aspect, a vehicle cab suspension comprises a body, with a mounting
   member positioned at least partially within the body. A resilient member connects
   the body to the mounting member and is placed in a compressed condition
 5 between the body and the mounting member when the vehicle cab suspension is
   in an unloaded condition.
           In another aspect, a vehicle cab suspension comprises a body, with a
   mounting member positioned at least partially within the body. A plurality of
   resilient members connect the body to the mounting member, with the body
10 including at least one lower projection positioned below the resilient members and
   configured to restrict movement of at least one of the resilient members during
   use.
           In yet another aspect, a vehicle cab suspension comprises a body, with a
   mounting member positioned at least partially within the body. A plurality of
15 resilient members connect the body to the mounting member, with the body
   including at least one upper projection positioned above the resilient members
   and configured to restrict movement of at least one of the resilient members
   during use.

           DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS
           The embodiments disclosed herein are for the purpose of providing a
10 description of the present subject matter, and it is understood that the subject
   matter may be embodied in various other forms and combinations not shown in
   detail. Therefore, specific embodiments and features disclosed herein are not to
   be interpreted as limiting the subject matter as defined in the accompanying
   claims.
15         Figs. 1-4 show selected components of a vehicle cab suspension 10
   incorporating aspects of the present disclosure. The vehicle cab suspension 10
   includes a body 12 which, in the illustrated embodiment, is comprised of a first
   body piece 14 and a second body piece 16 (Figs. 5-8). In other embodiments, the
   body 12 may be provided with a single-piece construction. The body 12 defines
20 an open interior in which at least a portion of a mounting member 18 (Figs. 9-12)
   may be positioned or received. The illustrated mounting member 18 is connected
   to the body 12 by plurality of resilient members (Fig. 4). In the illustrated
   embodiment, in which the body 12 is comprised of first and second body pieces
   14 and 16, the first body piece 14 is connected to the mounting member 18 by a
25 first resilient member 20 and the second body piece 16 is connected to the
   mounting member 18 by a second resilient member 22.
           A portion of the vehicle cab suspension 10 is connected to a portion of a
   vehicle frame 24, while another portion of the vehicle cab suspension 10 is
   connected to a portion of a vehicle cab (not illustrated) to dampen vibrations and
30 impacts transmitted to the vehicle cab from the vehicle frame 24. In the illustrated
   embodiment, the body 12 is connected to the vehicle frame 24 (Figs. 1-4) and the
   mounting member 18 is connected to a portion of the vehicle cab. In other
   embodiments, the mounting member 18 may be connected to the vehicle frame
                                              -3-

   24, with the body 12 being connected to the vehicle cab.
           Figs. 5-8 illustrate a first or second body piece 14, 16, as the first and
   second body pieces 14 and 16 may be substantially identical. However, it is also
   within the scope of the present disclosure for the first and second body pieces to
 5 be differently configured. The first and second body pieces 14 and 16 and the
   individual portions thereof may be made from a variety of materials. In one
   embodiment, the first and second body pieces 14 and 16 are comprised of a
   relatively rigid material, which may be a metallic material, such as (but not limited
   to) an aluminum material. The first and second body pieces 14 and 16 may each
10 be formed as integrated members (e.g., by a casting process) or may have a
   composite construction, formed from a plurality of elements (e.g., by fabricating a
   body piece by welding or otherwise securing various plates and/or elements
   together). It is also within the scope of the present disclosure for the first and
   second body pieces 14 and 16 to be combined in the form of an integrated, single
15 piece body 12 of the vehicle cab suspension 10.
           The illustrated body piece 14, 16 of Figs. 5-8 has a generally horizontal
   portion or wall 26 and a generally vertical portion or wall 28. As used herein,
   terms of direction (e.g., horizontal, vertical, upper, lower, etc.) refer to the
   orientation of the vehicle cab suspension 10 when secured to a vehicle frame 24,
20 as shown in Fig. 1. In one embodiment, the generally horizontal portion 26 and
   the generally vertical portion 28 may meet at or adjacent to a lateral or side edge
   of the generally horizontal portion 26 and at or adjacent to a bottom or lower edge
   of the generally vertical portion 28, thereby forming a generally L-shaped profile or
   cross-section (Fig. 7). Other configurations may also be employed without
25 departing from the scope of the present disclosure.
           The outer surfaces 30 and 32 of the generally horizontal portion 26 and the
   generally vertical portion 28 may be generally flat or planar. Such a configuration
   may be advantageous for securing the body 12 to the vehicle frame 24 or the
   vehicle cab. For example, if the generally vertical portion 28 of one or both of the
30 body pieces 14, 16 is to be connected to the vehicle frame 24 (as in Figs. 1-4) or
   the vehicle cab, the outer surface 32 of the generally vertical portion 28 may be
   generally flat or planar for a better fit to a generally flat or planar portion of the
   vehicle frame 24 or the vehicle cab. Similarly, if the generally horizontal portion
                                                -4-

   26 of one or both of the body pieces 14, 16 is to be connected to the vehicle frame
   24 or the vehicle cab, the outer surface 30 of the generally horizontal portion 26
   may be generally flat or planar for a better fit to a generally flat or planar portion of
   the vehicle frame 24 or the vehicle cab. In another embodiment, the outer
 5 surface(s) of the body piece(s) may be contoured or non-planar or otherwise
   include one or more features configured to cooperate with the portion of the
   vehicle frame or vehicle cab to which the body is to be secured.
            One or both of the inner surfaces 34 and 36 of the generally horizontal
   portion 26 and/or the generally vertical portion 28 of one or both of the body
10 pieces 14 and 16 may include a projection. In the illustrated embodiment, the
   generally vertical portion 28 of each body piece 14, 16 includes an inner surface
   34 with an upper projection 38 extending therefrom and positioned above the
   resilient members 20 and 22. In the illustrated embodiment, each body piece 14,
   16 includes a lower projection 40 extending from the inner surfaces 34 and 36 of
15 the generally horizontal and generally vertical portions 26 and 28 at the location
   where the generally horizontal and generally vertical portions 26 and 28 meet,
   below the resilient members 20 and 22. In other embodiments, one of the body
   pieces (or one side of the body) may have only one projection, with the other body
   piece (or other side of the body) having one, two, or no projections. In other
20 embodiments, one of the body pieces (or one side of the body) may have upper
   and lower projections, with the other body piece (or other side of the body) having
   one or no projections.
            Fig. 4 illustrates a pair of substantially identical upper projections 38.
   However, if the body 12 is provided with two upper projections, it is also within the
25 scope of the present disclosure for the upper projections to be differently
   configured. The illustrated upper projections 38 have an upper or top surface 42
   and a lower or bottom surface 44. The upper surface 42 may be variously
   configured, but it may be advantageous for the upper surface 42 to be configured
   so as not to come into contact with or otherwise interfere with movement of the
30 mounting member 18 during use of the vehicle cab suspension 10. In the
   illustrated embodiment, the upper surface 42 is provided as a generally planar
   inclined or angled surface, with a maximum elevation at an outer end and a
   minimum elevation at an inner end. Other configurations of the upper surface of
                                                -5-

   the upper projection may also be practiced without departing from the scope of the
   present disclosure.
           The lower surface 44 of the upper projection 38 is configured to restrict
   movement and/or deformation of the associated resilient member (i.e., the first
 5 resilient member 20 if the upper projection 38 is associated with the first body
   piece 14 or the second resilient member 22 if the upper projection 38 is
   associated with the second body piece 16) during use. The lower surface 44 of
   the upper projection 38 is preferably configured to allow for some upward
   movement or deformation of the associated resilient member prior to the resilient
10 member contacting the upper projection 38. Accordingly, the upper projection 38
   may be configured and oriented to establish a gap or space between the lower
   surface 44 and the associated resilient member 20, 22.
           The performance of the vehicle cab suspension 10 is affected by the
   amount or percentage of the resilient member upper surface 46 (Fig. 4) in contact
15 with the lower surface 44 of the upper projection 38 at a given upward deformation
   of the resilient member from its original configuration. An inner end 48 of each
   resilient member 20, 22 is connected to the mounting member 18, while an outer
   end 50 of each resilient member 20, 22 is connected to the associated body
   portion 14, 16. Moving the mounting member 18 upwardly a given distance with
20 respect to the body 12 causes the attached resilient members 20 and 22 to
   deform a given amount to follow the motion of the mounting member 18.
   Depending on the location of the upper projections 38 with respect to the resilient
   members 20 and 22 and the configuration of the lower surface 44 of the upper
   projections 38, a different amount or percentage of the upper surface 46 of the
25 resilient members 20 and 22 will come into contact with the lower surface 44 of
   the upper projections 38. For example, in one configuration, approximately 5% of
   the upper surface 46 of the resilient member 20, 22 may come into contact with
   the lower surface 44 of the associated upper projection 38 upon a given upward
   deformation whereas, in other configurations, the same deformation may instead
30 cause approximately 3% or 7% of the resilient member upper surface 46 to come
   into contact with the upper projection 38. It will be understood by those of
   ordinary skill in the art that the amount or percentage of contact between the
   resilient member 20, 22 and the upper projection 38 is a factor in the amount
                                              -6-

   and/or type of motion or deformation restriction provided by the upper projection
   38. The configuration of the gap or space between the upper projection 38 and
   the associated resilient member 20, 22 may be designed so as to control the
   contact therebetween. For example, the distance between the lower surface 44 of
 5 the upper projection 38 and the upper surface 46 of the associated resilient
   member 20, 22 may be either generally uniform or non-uniform. By controlling the
   configuration of the gap, it is possible to tune the performance of the vehicle cab
   suspension 10 to the desired specifications.
            In addition to the amount or percentage of contact between the resilient
10 member and the projection, there are other factors to consider and control,
   depending on the preferred performance of the vehicle cab suspension 10. For
   example, the location of the contact (e.g., whether there is contact at a generally
   outer location or at a generally inner location or at a generally central location) can
   modify the motion or deformation restriction provided by the projection. Further,
15 the degree which the contact percentage changes upon additional or less
   displacement or deformation (e.g., whether an additional quarter inch of upward
   deformation of the resilient member results in the contact percentage changing
   from approximately 5% to 6% or from approximately 5% to 7%) can also modify
   the motion or deformation restriction provided by the projection. All of these
20 factors may be controlled by varying the configuration of the gap and the
   configuration and/or composition of the upper projection 38 and/or the associated
   resilient member 20, 22.
            In the illustrated embodiment, the lower surfaces 44 of the upper
   projections 38 have a different contour or configuration than the upper surfaces 46
25 of the resilient members 20 and 22, causing there to be a non-uniform gap or
   separation or distance therebetween. In the illustrated embodiment, the upper
   surfaces 46 of the resilient members 20 and 22 are provided as generally planar
   inclined or angled surfaces in an unloaded condition (i.e., without a vehicle cab
   being supported by the vehicle cab suspension 10), with a maximum elevation at
30 an inner end 48 (which is connected to the mounting member 18) and a minimum
   elevation at an outer end 50 (which is connected to the body 12). In contrast, the
   illustrated upper projections 38 have outwardly curved or convex lower surfaces
   44, resulting in a non-uniform distance between the lower surfaces 44 of the upper
                                              -7-

   projections 38 and the upper surface 46 of the associated resilient member 20,
   22. The exact distance between the upper projections 38 and the resilient
   members 20 and 22 at the different points between the outer and inner ends of
   the gaps therebetween depends on the particular configuration of the lower
 5 surfaces 44 of the upper projections 38 and the upper surfaces 46 of the resilient
   members 20 and 22.
            In addition to showing two substantially identical upper projections 38, Fig.
   4 also illustrates a pair of substantially identical lower projections 40. However, if
   the body 12 is provided with a pair of lower projections, it is also within the scope
10 of the present disclosure for the lower projections to be differently configured. The
   illustrated lower projections 40 are shown as being in association with both the
   generally horizontal and generally vertical portions 26 and 28 of the associated
   body piece 14, 16. However, it is within the scope of the present disclosure for a
   lower projection to be associated with only one of the inner surfaces 34, 36 of the
15 body. For example, in one embodiment, a lower projection may extend from the
   generally vertical portion of the body, while being spaced away from the generally
   horizontal portion of the body. In another embodiment, a lower projection may
   extend from the generally horizontal portion of the body, while being spaced away
   from the generally vertical portion of the body. However, it may be preferred for
20 the lower projections to be associated with both the generally vertical and
   generally horizontal portions of the body or a body piece, as in the illustrated
   embodiment, for improved stability and strength.
            The lower projection 40 includes an upper or top surface 52, which may be
   variously configured. The upper surface 52 of the lower projection 40 is
25 configured to restrict movement and/or deformation of the associated resilient
   member (i.e., the first resilient member 20 if the lower projection 40 is associated
   with the first body piece 14 or the second resilient member 22 if the lower
   projection 40 is associated with the second body piece 16) during use. The upper
   surface 52 of the lower projection 40 is preferably configured to allow for some
30 downward movement or deformation of the associated resilient member prior to
   the resilient member contacting the lower projection 40. Accordingly, the lower
   projection 40 may be configured and oriented to establish a gap or space between
   the upper surface 52 and the associated resilient member 20, 22.
                                               -8-

           As is the case with the upper projection 38, the performance of the vehicle
   cab suspension 10 is affected by the amount or percentage of the resilient
   member in contact with the upper surface 52 of the lower projection 40 at a given
   downward deformation of the resilient member from its original configuration. For
 5 example, if upon deforming downwardly a given distance, approximately 5% of a
   lower surface 54 of the resilient member 20, 22 is in contact with the upper
   surface 52 of the lower projection 40, the lower projection 40 will provide a
   different motion or deformation restriction than if approximately 3% or 7% of the
   resilient member lower surface 54 is in contact with the lower projection 40. The
10 configuration of the gap or space between the lower projection 40 and the
   associated resilient member 20, 22 may be designed so as to control the contact
   therebetween. For example, the distance between the upper surface 52 of the
   lower projection 40 and the lower surface 54 of the associated resilient member
   20, 22 may be either generally uniform or non-uniform. By controlling the
15 configuration of the gap, it is possible to tune the performance of the vehicle cab
   suspension 10 to the desired specifications.
           As described above with respect to the upper projection 38, other design
   factors of the lower projections 40 and the resilient member 20 and 22 also affect
   the performance of the vehicle cab suspension 10. For example, the location of
20 the contact therebetween (e.g., whether there is contact at a generally outer
   location or at a generally inward location or at a generally central location) can
   modify the motion or deformation restriction provided by the lower projection.
   Further, the degree which the contact percentage changes upon additional or less
   displacement or deformation (e.g., whether an additional quarter inch of
25 downward deformation of the resilient member results in the contact percentage
   changing from approximately 5% to 6% or from approximately 5% to 7%) can also
   modify the motion or deformation restriction provided by the lower projection. All
   of these factors may be controlled by varying the configuration of the gap and the
   configuration and/or composition of the lower projection 40 and/or the associated
30 resilient member 20, 22.
           In the illustrated embodiment, the upper surfaces 52 of the lower projection
   40 have a different contour or configuration than the lower surfaces 54 of the
   resilient members 20 and 22, causing there to be a non-uniform gap or separation
                                              -9-

   or distance therebetween. In the illustrated embodiment, the lower surfaces 54 of
   the resilient members 20 and 22 are provided as generally planar inclined or
   angled surfaces in an unloaded condition (i.e., without a vehicle cab being
   supported by the vehicle cab suspension 10), with a maximum elevation at an
 5 inner end 48 (which is connected to the mounting member 18) and a minimum
   elevation at an outer end 50 (which is connected to the body 12). In contrast, the
   illustrated lower projections 40 have outwardly curved or convex upper surfaces
   52, resulting in a non-uniform distance between the upper surfaces 52 of the lower
   projections 40 and the lower surfaces 54 of the resilient members 20 and 22. The
10 exact distance between the lower projections 40 and the resilient members 20 and
   22 at the different points between the outer and inner ends of the gap
   therebetween depends on the particular configuration of the upper surfaces 52 of
   the lower projections 40 and the lower surfaces 54 of the resilient members 20
   and 22.
15          In the illustrated embodiment, the distance between the resilient members
   20 and 22 and the lower projections 40 is different than the distance between the
   resilient members 20 and 22 and the upper projections 38 when the vehicle cab
   suspension 10 is in an unloaded condition. This may have the effect of allowing a
   different amount of vertical displacement or deformation of the resilient members
20 20 and 22 prior to them coming into contact with the upper versus the lower
   projections. In other embodiments, the resilient members 20 and 22 may be
   approximately equidistant from the upper and lower projections 20 and 22 when
   the vehicle cab suspension 10 is in an unloaded condition.
            The distance between the resilient members 20 and 22 and the projections
25 38 and 40 depends on a number of factors, including the location and
   configuration of the projections 38 and 40, as described above, as well as the
   location and configuration of the resilient members 20 and 22. For example, in
   the illustrated embodiment, each resilient member 20, 22 is configured with an
   inner end surface 48 (which may be substantially vertical) connected to the
30 mounting member 18 and an outer end surface 50 (which may be substantially
   vertical) connected to the body 12 (Fig. 4). In the illustrated embodiment, the
   ends 48 and 50 of the resilient members 20 and 22 are positioned at different
   elevations when the vehicle cab suspension 10 is in an unloaded condition. In
                                             -10-

   particular, the outer end 50 of each resilient member 20, 22 is positioned at a
   lower elevation than the inner end 48 when the vehicle cab suspension 10 is in an
   unloaded condition. In the illustrated embodiment, this configuration is achieved
   by providing resilient members 20 and 22 having a cross-section or profile which
 5 defines a generally rhomboidal shape when the vehicle cab suspension 10 is in an
   unloaded condition. Such an angled or inclined configuration may be
   advantageous because, upon loading the vehicle cab suspension 10 with a
   vehicle cab, the mounting member 18 will be downwardly displaced and the
   resilient members 20 and 22 downwardly deformed, thereby placing the resilient
10 members 20 and 22 in a more horizontal configuration that may be better suited
   for dampening both upward and downward applied forces and impacts.
           The load applied to the vehicle cab suspension 10 (and, hence, the resilient
   members 20 and 22) by a vehicle cab in a loaded condition varies depending on
   the nature of the vehicle cab. For example, a heavier cab will apply a greater
15 force than a lighter cab, thereby causing a greater downward deformation of the
   resilient members 20 and 22 and a greater downward displacement of the
   mounting member 18. Thus, if the resilient members are intended to have a
   generally inclined or angled configuration in an unloaded condition and a generally
   horizontal configuration in a loaded condition, it may be advantageous to consider
20 the nature of the vehicle cab during the design process to ensure that the resilient
   members assume the desired inclination when the vehicle cab is connected to the
   vehicle cab suspension.
           While a preferred configuration is illustrated, it is also within the scope of
   the present disclosure for the resilient members to have other configurations. For
25 example, the resilient members may be configured such that their ends are
   positioned at approximately the same elevation when the vehicle cab suspension
   is in an unloaded condition. The resilient members may also have non
   rhomboidal cross-sections or profiles. Furthermore, although it may be preferable
   for the resilient members to be substantially identical and connected to the other
30 components of the vehicle cab suspension in the same way, it is also within the
   scope of the present disclosure for at least one resilient member to have a
   different configuration and be connected to the associated body piece and
   mounting member differently than another resilient member.
                                             -11-

            In the illustrated embodiment, the resilient members 20 and 22 are
   positioned closer to the upper projections 38 than to the lower projections 40
   when the vehicle cab suspension 10 is in an unloaded condition. In other
   embodiments, the resilient members may be positioned closer to the lower
 5 projections than to the upper projections or approximately equidistant from the
   upper and lower projections when the vehicle cab suspension is in an unloaded
   condition. However, the illustrated configuration may be preferred because, upon
   loading the vehicle cab suspension 10 with a vehicle cab, the mounting member
   18 will be downwardly displaced and the resilient members 20 and 22 downwardly
10 deformed, thereby placing the resilient members 20 and 20 into a more centered
   location with respect to the upper and lower projections 38 and 40. The load
   applied to the vehicle cab suspension 10 (and, hence, the resilient members 20
   and 22) by a vehicle cab in a loaded condition varies depending on the nature of
   the vehicle cab. For example, a heavier cab will apply a greater force than a
15 lighter cab, thereby causing a greater downward displacement of the mounting
   member 18 and greater downward deformation of the resilient members 20 and
   22. Thus, it may be advantageous to consider the nature of the vehicle cab when
   designing the vehicle cab suspension 10 to ensure that the resilient members 20
   and 22 and the mounting member 22 are positioned at the preferred height when
20 the vehicle cab is connected to the vehicle cab suspension 10.
            According to one aspect of the present disclosure, the vehicle cab
   suspension 10 is configured such that the resilient members 20 and 22 are always
   in a compressed condition, regardless of whether the vehicle cab suspension 10
   itself is in a loaded or an unloaded condition. Stated differently, the non
25 compressed width or length of each resilient member 20, 22 (i.e., the distance
   between the inner and outer ends 48 and 50) is greater than the distance between
   the surfaces to which the ends 48 and 50 of the resilient members 20 and 22 are
   connected. Thus, the uncompressed width or length of the first resilient member
   20 is greater than the distance between the generally vertical portion 28 of the first
30 body piece 14 and the mounting member 18, such that the first resilient member
   20 must be compressed to fit in that space. Similarly, the uncompressed width or
   length of the second resilient member 22 is greater than the distance between the
   generally vertical portion 28 of the second body piece 16 and the mounting
                                             -12-

   member 18, such that the second resilient member 22 must be compressed to fit
   in that space.
            The manner in which the resilient members 20 and 22 are placed into a
   compressed condition may vary according to the configuration of the vehicle cab
 5 suspension 10. In one method of assembling a vehicle cab suspension 10 having
   a body 12 comprised of first and second body pieces 14 and 16, the internal
   components of the vehicle cab suspension 10 (i.e., the resilient members 20 and
   22 and the mounting member 18) may be connected together and to the body
   pieces 14 and 16, as appropriate, with the resilient members 20 and 22 in a non
10 compressed condition. Thereafter, the body pieces 14 and 16 may be brought
   together and secured to each other, thereby placing the resilient members 20 and
   22 in a compressed condition.
            In another embodiment, the first and second body pieces 14 and 16 may
   be replaced by an integrated, single-piece body 12. If a single-piece body 12 is
15 provided, the resilient members 20 and 22 may be maintained in a compressed
   condition prior to and during placement of them into the interior of the body 12.
   Alternatively, the resilient members 20 and 22 may be placed into the interior of
   the body 12 in an uncompressed condition and then compressed by a mechanism
   applying a compressive force from within the interior of the body 22. In the
20 interest of simplifying the assembly process, it may be preferable to provide the
   vehicle cab suspension 10 with two body pieces 14 and 16, rather than a single
   piece body 16, because compressing the resilient members 20 and 22 by external
   means (e.g., as a part of connecting the body pieces 14 and 16 together) may be
   easier than compressing them prior to or after insertion into a single-piece body
25 12.
            If the vehicle cab suspension 10 is provided with two body pieces 14 and
   16 instead of a single-piece body, the two body pieces 14 and 16 may be
   connected by any of a variety of means, such as the use of mechanical fasteners
   or a welding procedure or an adhesion process or an interference or friction fit.
30 Non-permanent fixation methods (e.g., the use of mechanical fasteners) may be
   preferable to permanent fixation methods (e.g., welding) for purposes of
   disassembling and servicing the vehicle cab suspension 10, if need be. In the
   illustrated embodiment, the body pieces 14 and 16 are connected by mechanical
                                             -13-

   fasteners 56 (Figs. 1-4), with the generally vertical portions 28 including one or
   more holes or apertures 58 configured to accommodate the mechanical fasteners
   56 (Figs. 5-8). If other means are employed to connect the body pieces 14 and 16
   (e.g., a welding or adhesion process or an interference or friction fit), the holes 58
 5 may be omitted and/or replaced with other features configured to cooperate with
   the selected connection means.
           The vehicle cab suspension 10 may further include one or more spacer
   plates 60, an exemplary one of which is illustrated in greater detail in Figs. 13 and
   14. In the illustrated embodiment, two spacer plates 60 are provided, with one
10 positioned at or adjacent to a leading end 62 of the body pieces 14 and 16 and the
   other positioned at or adjacent to a trailing end 64 of the body pieces 14 and 16
   (Fig. 1). The illustrated spacer plates 60 determine the separation between the
   generally vertical portions 28 of the body pieces 14 and 16. Accordingly, it may
   be preferred to select spacer plates 60 having a width (in the direction between
15 the vertical portions 28 of the body pieces 14 and 16) that is less than the
   combined width of the resilient members 20 and 22 in their uncompressed
   condition. Selecting spacer plates 60 with such a width ensures that the resilient
   members 20 and 22 are in a compressed condition when the vertical portions 28
   of the body pieces 14 and 16 are tightened against the spacer plates 60, In other
20 embodiments, more or fewer than two spacer plates 60 may be provided. Each
   spacer plate 60 may be configured to extend between the generally vertical
   portions 28 of the first and second body pieces 14 and 16, thereby providing the
   body 12 formed by the body pieces 14 and 16 with additional stiffness and
   strength and further serving to prevent debris from entering into the interior of the
25 vehicle cab suspension 10.
           If the body pieces 14 and 16 are connected by mechanical fasteners, the
   spacer plate 60 may include features adapted to receive or accommodate the
   fasteners. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the body pieces 14 and 16
   are connected by a total of four mechanical fasteners 56, with two mechanical
30 fasteners 56 located at or adjacent to the leading end 62 of the body pieces 14
   and 16 and two mechanical fasteners 56 located at or adjacent to the trailing end
   64 of the body pieces 14 and 16. In this case, the two spacer plates 60 include
   upper and lower grooves or channels 66 (Figs. 13 and 14) for receiving the
                                              -14-

   fasteners 56. If the body pieces 14 and 16 are connected by differently configured
   fasteners or other means, the spacer plates employed therewith may be differently
   configured from those illustrated in Figs. 13 and 14 to better cooperate with the
   connection means.
 5         The mounting member 18 of the vehicle cab suspension 10 is illustrated in
   greater detail in Figs. 9-12. The mounting member 18 has an upper or top end 68
   and a lower or bottom end 70 connected by a midsection 72. In the illustrated
   embodiment, the mounting member 18 has a generally T-shaped cross-section or
   profile (Fig. 11), with a relatively wide upper end 68, a lower end 70 that is
10 narrower than the upper end 68, and a midsection 72 that is narrower than the
   lower end 70. It may be advantageous for the lower end 70 to be relatively wide
   to act as a positive stop when the mounting member 18 moves in an upward
   vertical direction. In particular, a head-on collision may tend to cause the vehicle
   cab to pivot forward, thereby moving the mounting member 18 (which is secured
15 to the cab) to move upwardly with respect to the remainder of the vehicle cab
   suspension 10. In combination with the presence of the inner ends 48 of the
   resilient members 20 and 22, a relatively wide lower end 70 is unable to pass
   through the gap between the upper projections 38 at a given upward force,
   thereby acting as a positive stop in the event of a head-on collision, By adjusting
20 the width of the lower end 70 and/or the durometer of the resilient members 20
   and 22, the upward force that the vehicle cab suspension 10 is capable of
   resisting may be adjusted to the needs of the particular vehicle into which the
   vehicle cab suspension 10 is to be incorporated. In other embodiments, the
   mounting member may be differently configured, for example, having a lower end
25 with substantially the same width as the upper end or a greater width than the
   upper end. It is also within the scope of the present disclosure for the midsection
   to be as wide or wider than either or both of the upper and lower ends.
           In the illustrated embodiment, the upper end 68 of the mounting member
   18 is configured to be attached to a portion of a vehicle cab. The upper end 68 of
30 the mounting member 18 is shown as being generally flat or planar, which may be
   advantageous when connecting the mounting member 18 to a flat or planar
   portion of the vehicle cab, but the upper end of the mounting member may be
   differently configured to better mate with the corresponding portion of the vehicle
                                              -15-

   cab. The upper end 68 of the mounting member 18 may include other features for
   better securing the mounting member 18 to the vehicle cab. For example, in the
   illustrated embodiment, the upper end 68 of the mounting member 18 is provided
   with a plurality of openings or holes 74 extending therethrough for receiving
 5 mechanical fasteners to secure the mounting member 18 to the vehicle cab.
   Other means may be employed for securing the mounting member 18 to the
   vehicle cab (e.g., a welding operation), but it may be preferable for the mounting
   member 18 to be removably secured to the vehicle cab to allow the vehicle cab
   suspension 10 to be removed from the vehicle cab for servicing.
10          The midsection 72 of the mounting member 18 is configured for attachment
   of the inner ends 48 of the resilient members 20 and 22, as shown in Fig. 4. In
   one embodiment, the lateral sides of the midsection 72 include a pocket or
   indentation 76 configured to receive at least a portion of the inner end 48 of the
   associated resilient member 20, 22. Similarly, the inner surfaces 36 of the
15 generally vertical portions 28 of the body pieces 14 and 16 may include a pocket
   or indentation 78 (Figs. 5-8) configured to receive at least a portion of the outer
   end 50 of the associated resilient member 20, 22.
            The ends 48 and 50 of the resilient members 20 and 22 may be configured
   to be attached to the mounting member 18 and body 12 by any of a number of
20 means. For example, the resilient members 20 and 22 may be configured to be
   secured within the pockets 76 and 78 (if provided) by a press fit or friction fit,
   which simplifies installation and removal of the resilient members 20 and 22. In
   other embodiments, the resilient members 20 and 22 may be more permanently
   secured to the mounting member 18 and/or the body 12, such as by an adhesion
25 process or by otherwise forming a material bond between the resilient member 20,
   22 and the mounting member 18 or body 12 (e.g., a metal-to-rubber bond if the
   resilient members 20 and 22 are comprised of a rubber material). It is also within
   the scope of the present disclosure for the resilient members 20 and 22 to be
   connected to the mounting member 18 and body 12 by different means, for
30 example, by securing the resilient members 20 and 22 to the mounting member
   18 by permanent means and to the body 12 by non-permanent means.
            The nature of the resilient members 20 and 22 may affect the means by
   which they are attached to the mounting member 18 and the body 12. For
                                             -16-

   example, if the resilient members 20 and 22 are substantially entirely comprised of
   an elastomeric material, such as rubber, or at least have ends 48 and 50
   comprised of an elastomeric material, the means by which they are attached to
   the mounting member 18 and the body 12 may be different from what would be
 5 preferred or possible if one or both of the ends 48 and 50 of the resilient members
   20 and 22 are instead formed from a relatively rigid material (e.g., a metal plate).
   Hence, the present disclosure is not limited to a particular means of connecting
   the resilient members 20 and 22 to the mounting member 18 and the body 12.
           As for the lower end 70 of the mounting member 18, it is oriented to face
10 the bottom of the body 12 or the generally horizontal portions 26 of the body
   pieces 14 and 16, but to not come into contact therewith during use. As described
   in greater detail above, the resilient members 20 and 22 are configured to come
   into contact with the lower projections 40 upon sufficient downward deformation of
   the resilient members 20 and 22 and downward movement of the mounting
15 member 18. The mounting member 18 is preferably formed from a relatively rigid
   material (such as a metallic material), so the vehicle cab suspension 10 is
   configured to avoid the mounting member 18 "bottoming out" by the lower end 70
   coming into metal-to-metal contact with the bottom of the body 12 or the generally
   horizontal portions 26 of the body pieces 14 and 16. If the mounting member 18
20 "bottoms out," the metal-to-metal contact between the mounting member 18 and
   the body 12 results in a rigid (i.e., non-resilient) connection between the vehicle
   frame 24 (which is rigidly secured to the body 12) and the vehicle cab (which is
   rigidly secured to the mounting member 18). Avoiding a rigid connection is an
   aspect of the present disclosure because, in such a situation, all of the impacts
25 and vibrations experienced by the vehicle frame 24 are directly transferred to the
   vehicle cab, rather than being dissipated or absorbed. Accordingly, the lower end
   70 of the mounting member 18 is preferably configured so as to not come into
   contact with the body 12 under even extreme loading conditions.
           Designing the vehicle cab suspension 10 to avoid "bottoming out" depends
30 on a number of factors, including the location and configuration of the lower
   projections 40 and the resilient members 20 and 22, as described in greater detail
   above. Additionally, the lower end 70 of the mounting member 18 is less likely to
   come into contact with the body 12 if it is positioned relatively close to the location
                                              -17-

   at which the resilient members 20 and 22 connect to the midsection 72. For
   example, Fig. 4 shows that the resilient members 20 and 22 are connected to the
   midsection 72 at a location relatively close to the lower end 70 of the mounting
   member 18. In comparison, if the lower end 70 of the mounting member 18 was
 5 positioned twice as far away from resilient member 20 and 22, it would be closer
   to the bottom of the body 12 and, thus, more likely to come into contact therewith
   in extreme loading conditions.
           In one manner of associating the vehicle cab suspension 10 to a vehicle,
   the vehicle cab suspension 10 is assembled and secured to the vehicle frame 24
10 and vehicle cab. Alternatively, rather than being fully assembled and then
   secured to the vehicle frame 24 and vehicle cab, the vehicle cab suspension 10
   may be only partially assembled at the time it is secured to the vehicle frame 24
   and/or the vehicle cab. While only one vehicle cab suspension 10 is illustrated, it
   should be understood that a plurality of vehicle cab suspensions 10 may be
15 connected to the vehicle cab and the vehicle frame 24. If two or more vehicle cab
   suspensions are used, they may either be identical or differently configured. In
   one example, if a front end of the vehicle cab is connected by a hinge or pivot to
   the vehicle frame 24, it may be advantageous to employ two vehicle cab
   suspension 10, with one positioned at or adjacent to each rear corner of the
20 vehicle cab to connect the rear of the vehicle cab to the vehicle frame 24. Using a
   plurality of vehicle cab suspensions may be preferred to using a single vehicle cab
   suspension, as the load is distributed amongst them (thereby decreasing the load
   on any individual vehicle cab suspension) and a multiple suspension system may
   have improved balance. However, it should also be understood that there may be
25 circumstances in which it would be advantageous to employ a single vehicle cab
   suspension instead of a plurality of vehicle cab suspensions.
           With the vehicle cab loaded onto the vehicle cab suspension 10, the
   vehicle cab suspension 10 moves from an unloaded condition (Fig. 4) to a loaded
   condition in which the mounting member 18 is at a lower elevation due to the
30 weight of the vehicle cab. The resilient members 20 and 22 are downwardly
   deformed, with their outer ends 50 remaining in place at the location at which they
   are secured to the body 12, and with the inner ends 48 at a lower elevation to
   correspond to the position of the mounting member 18 (to which the inner ends 48
                                             -18-

   are attached). Generally speaking, the mounting member 18 continues to move
   downwardly until the resistive force of the resilient members 20 and 22 matches
   the weight of the vehicle cab. In a preferred embodiment, the vehicle cab
   suspension 10 is configured such that, in a loaded condition, the resilient
 5 members 20 and 22 assume a more horizontal orientation, with the lower end 70
   of the mounting member 18 spaced away from the bottom of the body 12.
           During use, the vehicle frame 24 experiences shocks, impacts, and
   vibrations that are transmitted to the body 12 of the vehicle cab suspension 10.
   The forces experienced by the body 12 are transmitted to the mounting member
10 18 by the resilient members 20 and 22. The resilient members 20 and 22 absorb
   a portion of the forces, rather than transmitting them on a 1:1 basis, as a rigid
   interconnection would, such that the forces experienced by the mounting member
   18 amount to a modified, lesser version of the forces experienced by the vehicle
   frame 24. The forces experienced by the mounting member 18 are directly
15 transmitted to the vehicle cab, such that the forces experienced by the vehicle cab
   are less extreme than the original forces experienced by the vehicle frame 24.
           As forces are transmitted to the mounting member 18, it moves upwardly
   and downwardly with the deforming resilient members 20 and 22. Upon a
   sufficiently large force, the resilient members 20 and 22 may be brought into
20 contact with the upper projections 38 or the lower projections 40. The contact
   between the resilient members 20 and 22 and the projections 38, 40 limits the
   total range of vertical travel available to the mounting member 18 (and, hence, the
   vehicle cab) with respect to the body 12 and vehicle frame 24. In a preferred
   embodiment, the separation between the lower end 70 of the mounting member
25 18 and the bottom of the body 12 is greater than the separation between the
   resilient members 20 and 22 and the lower projections 40, such that the resilient
   members 20 and 22 come into contact with the lower projections 40 prior to the
   mounting member 18 coming into contact with the bottom of the body 12. Most
   preferably, the separation between the lower end 70 of the mounting member 18
30 and the bottom of the body 12 is sufficiently great (and the other design and
   environmental factors that affect the downward travel of the mounting member 18
   are adequately accounted for) such that the two will not come into contact during
   use, even upon extreme shocks to the vehicle frame 24. By such a configuration,
                                              -19-

   the vehicle cab suspension 10 avoids "bottoming out" and directly transmitting
   forces between the vehicle frame 24 and the vehicle cab.
           It will be understood that the embodiments described above are illustrative
   of some of the applications of the principles of the present subject matter.
