Technical Field
 [0001]          The  present      invention        relates     to a  system and a
method for performing processing to invoice a gas fee.
Background Art
 [0002]          It is known that LP gas has been supplied by gas
imported from gas-producing countries and gas as a byproduct
of domestic process of petroleum oil                    products.    An import base
for storing       LP gas transferred       from gas-producing countries by
a tanker and a petroleum oil purification base are called as
a primary base.          LP gas are loaded from the primary base to
domestic vessels or tank lorries                and is      shipped to a secondary
base that     is   located at a coast or an inland and that               functions
as  a   stopping      base     for   LP gas     transportation.         The LP   gas
                                         - 1 --

transported to the secondary base is                          transported to an LP gas
filling station at each location (i.e., a delivery base) and
is filled into a gas cylinder                    (gas bomb) at a delivery base.
 [0003]          The gas cylinders filled                  at   the respective filling
stations are delivered by a deliveryman to a customer's home
 (e.g.,     a  standard home, collective housing, or office).                              An
empty gas cylinder of the customer's home is                           exchanged with a
filled      gas cylinder and the empty gas cylinder is                       collected     to
a filling      station.         Each filling         station       has a fixed delivery
area responsible for a deliveryman.                            A  deliveryman receives
delivery slips           corresponding to 2 to 10 days showing delivery
destinations          to which gas cylinders                   should be delivered to
customer's homes within the delivery area.
 [0004]          A delivery slip          is   prepared by a delivery manager.
First,      with     regard     to  each      customer,          the  amount     of    LP gas
remaining in the gas cylinder is predicted based on the past
gas     usage,      the     meter   indication           of     the  gas    meter      of the
customer's home, and the actually-delivered                          number.       Then,  the
next      delivery       due    date   of     gas     cylinder(s)        is   determined.
Integration        is   carried   out for all        customers within the delivery
area responsible for the deliveryman to determine the delivery
amount of gas cylinders corresponding to 2 to 10 days.
 [0005]          After the deliveryman exchanges the gas cylinder
with the new one by the deliveryman based on the delivery slip,
the deliveryman writes, into a delivery slip, the respective
items of a date of exchange,             the meter indication             of the exchange
date, the cylinder number, and the safety                         inspection.        When the
                                              - 2 --

daily delivery operation is completed, the delivery slip is
submitted to the delivery manager.             The delivery slip    returned
to the delivery manager is checked for an incomplete form by
the delivery manager and is           subsequently stored as data used
to calculate the next delivery due date.                A  system has been
suggested to provide an efficient delivery of gas cylinders
under a system as described above            (see Patent Publication 1).
 [0006]        As disclosed in      Patent Publication 1,      a system gas
for   an efficient      cylinder delivery        has  been  conventionally
provided.      However,   there have been no system that          can charge
a gas fee based on the execution of a gas meter reading together
with an unpaid gas fee for which a fixed period has already passed
since the previous invoice.
 [0007]         Generally,   it   has been known to charge a gas fee by
a handy terminal not including a communication function.                  In
this case however, it was required to check whether there is
an unpaid gas fee or not by using a computer terminal other than
the   handy    terminal   to    inquire   of   a  server  for   the payment
situation at the time.           Furthermore, even when the computer
terminal is      used for an inquiry, the payment situation          must be
always updated.        Therefore,      if the    inquiry timing does not
concur with the       charge timing, wrong charge details may be
issued.

Description of Embodiments
                                               6--

 [0014]      The   following      section        will       describe    briefly      the
configuration     of a   system      in    this     embodiment.         This    system
performs a gas meter reading together with a gas fee invoicing
operation.
 [0015]      Fig.      1   illustrates            a     network      configuration
according to one embodiment of the                   invention.        In Fig. 1, a
delivery server      (invoice issuing           system) 101 is        configured to
be communicatively connected, via a network 102,                     to a plurality
of payment computers 103a and 103b,                  - - -,  103n.   This delivery
server 101 is   configured to be communicatively connected,                          via
a network 104, to aplurality         of mobile terminals (communication
terminals) 105a, 105b,        ---  ,    105n.       In the description common
to the respective plurality          of payment computers 103a to 103n,
the respective payment computers will                  be simply referred          to as
a  payment computer      103.      In     the    description        common      to   the
respective plurality       of plurality          of mobile terminals 105a to
105n,   the respective mobile terminals will                   be simply referred
to as a mobile terminal 105.
 [0016]      The payment computer 103 is,                 for example,     a computer
for performing a gas fee payment for example and includes a CPU
and a storage apparatus       (not shown) for example.                 This payment
computer 103 is    connected to a delivery server 101 and notifies
the delivery server 101 of the payment situation determined
based on whether the payment is               made or not for example.               The
payment types include, for example, the payment using a bill
at  a convenience store     or a post office,             an automatic bank debit
                                        - 7 --

through a bank account, the payment by a credit card, or an
on-line electronic payment.
 [0017]         The mobile terminal 105 is          a terminal that          is  used
by a meter reader to confirm the meter indication                  of a gas meter
attached to a piece of supply equipment including a gas cylinder
and that     includes, for example,      CPU, memory, an input apparatus,
and     a   display  apparatus.        The    meter    reader      collects       the
indication      data including the meter indication            of the gas meter
via the mobile terminal 105 to send the data to the delivery
server 101.
 [0018]
 [Delivery server configuration]
          Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a configuration
example of the delivery server 101.              In   Fig.  2,    a case will      be
described in      which a single computer system is            used.        However,
there also may be a case in which the delivery server 101 is
configured as a part       of a multi-functional         distributed           system
composed of a plurality of computer systems.
 [0019]         As shown in   Fig.  2,    the delivery server 101 has:               a
CPU 301,      a system bus 302,    a RAM 303,      an input apparatus 304,
an output apparatus 305,       a communication control apparatus 306,
and a storage apparatus          (management unit) 307.
 [0020]         The CPU 301 is connected to the respective components
via the system bus 302          to perform processing to transfer a
control signal or data and to perform the execution of various
pieces of softwares for the operation of the entire delivery
server 101 and calculation processing for example.
                                       - 8 --

 [0021]          The RAM 303 includes a work area to temporarily store
data and a software program.
 [0022]          The      storage      apparatus        307  is  configured        by  a
non-volatile         storage medium such as ROM or HDD and includes a
program storage region that               stores     a software program and a data
storage region that           stores     data of continuously-stored data or
processing result data for example. For example, a software
program for example is             read out from the program storage region
of the storage apparatus 307 to the work area of the RAM 303
and the software program is               carried      out by the CPU 301,     thereby
allowing the CPU 301 of this              embodiment to realize        the functions
of the respective parts             31 to 35 (which will      be described later).
 [0023]          The CPU 301 includes, as shown in              Fig. 2,  a receiving
unit    31,  a calculation       unit   32, a payment situation         confirmation
unit 33,       an issuing unit 34,             and a transmission unit 35.
 [0024]          The     receiving      unit      31   receives    from   the    mobile
terminal 105 a gas meter reading processing request for a meter
reading       target.         In     this     embodiment,      the    meter    reading
processing request is performed using indication                      data including
the meter indication            showing a gas usage based on a gas cylinder
and the meter reading date for example.                        The details of the
indication data will be described later.
 [0025]          The calculation          unit     32 performs the meter reading
processing         depending         on    the     above-described       request      to
calculate       the gas fee of a customer based on the meter reading
of the present month.

 [0026]          The calculation           unit      32 performs the meter reading
processing by performing, for example,                         the calculation          of   { (the
meter indication          of the present meter reading date)                     -  (the meter
indication       of the previous meter reading date)} to calculate
the gas usage in          a period from the previous meter reading date
to the present meter reading date.                          After the calculation of
the gas usage,          the calculation            unit     32 calculates,         based on a
predetermined         calculating           formula         (e.g.,     (basic      fee)+(unit
fee) x (gas usage) ) , the gas fee of a customer based on the meter
reading of the present month.                    Specifically,          the gas fee of the
customer based on the meter reading of the present month is,
for example,       the gas fee for the gas usage in                      a period from the
previous meter reading date to the present meter reading date.
The above-described method of calculating the gas fee is not
limited      to the above-described example and can be performed from
various points of view.
 [0027]         The payment situation               confirmation unit          33 confirms,
based       on  the     payment      situation           of     the   storage        apparatus
 (management unit)         307 for managing the gas fee payment situation
of the customer, the gas fee payment situation                          prior   to the meter
reading of the present month for the customer calculated                                   by the
calculation        unit     32     based     on     the     request        received       by    the
receiving unit        31.     The payment situation                managed by the storage
apparatus 307 will be described in detail later.

the payment situation                confirmation unit                 33 reads the unpaid gas
fee from the storage apparatus 307.
 [0029]            The    issuing          unit      34     issues          invoice    information
including the gas fee based on the meter reading of the present
month calculated              by the calculation                 unit      32 and the unpaid gas
fee read by the payment situation confirmation unit 33.
 [0030]            The     transmission              unit       35     sends,     to    the  mobile
terminal 105,         the invoice information issued by the issuing unit
34.       The invoice information includes the gas fee based on the
meter reading of the present month for example and the details
thereof will be described later.
 [0031]            Fig.      3    illustrates             a    configuration           example   of
customer information d30 stored in                               the storage apparatus 307
of the delivery server 101.                         As shown in Fig. 3, the storage
apparatus 307 stores               therein        a "customer ID" d31for identifying
a customer,         a   "meter number" d32 for identifying                            a gas meter,
and a "gas cylinder capacity" d33 for example.
 [0032]            Fig.      4A    and      Fig.       4B     illustrate          an   example   of
information including the customer payment situation                                      stored in
the storage apparatus 307 of the delivery server 101.                                       Fig. 4A
illustrates         a table     storing         the gas fee payment situation.                 Fig.
4B     illustrates          a   table        storing         the      gas     appliance     payment
situation.
 [0033]            The table       d40A of Fig. 4A stores                    the above-described
"customer ID" d41,             the "meter reading month" d42,                        the "gas fee"
d43,      and the "payment             situation"            d44.        In   one example of the
table       d40A of Fig. 4A, a customer having the customer ID "A001"
                                                     11 =

is set to have "3500 yen" as a gas fee corresponding to the
present month of "January" and a record is                provided to show that
this     gas fee is     already "paid".      By this    configuration, whether
each customer has paid each gas fee based on the meter reading
of the present month is managed.
 [0034]         The table       d50 of Fig.   4B stores    the above-described
"customer ID"d51, the "gas appliance cost" d52, and the "payment
situation"      d53.      The gas appliances include,        for example,       a gas
cooking appliance, a gas heater, and a gas fan heater.
 [0035]          In   one example of the table          of Fig.   4B,   a customer
having the customer ID "A001" is              set    to have the gas appliance
cost of "3600" yen and a record is                provided to show that          this
cost       is "unpaid" .         Thus,  the    gas    appliance    cost      payment
situation      including the customer payment situation               is  managed.
 [0036]         The "payment situations" d44 and d53 in the table
of Fig. 4A or Fig. 4B are set to be "paid" when the delivery
server 101 receives notification              from the payment computer 103.
Specifically, the payment computer 103 sends to the delivery
server 101,       after     performing the payment of the gas fee or the
gas appliance cost, information for notifying                 the payment (e.g.,
the customer ID,           the payment date,      the meter reading month of
the paid gas fee,          or the gas appliance cost) .         As a result,       the
delivery       server        101   changes    the     corresponding       "payment
situations" d44 and d53 in the tables d40 and d50 of Fig. 4A
or Fig. 4B        from "unpaid" to       "paid".

          Next, the        following section will describe a method of
invoicing a gas fee when a gas meter reading is                   performed.      Fig.
5 is    a flowchart illustrating         an example of the entire          operation
of the delivery server 101.               Fig.   6 illustrates        an example of
the indication data of the gas meter.                       Fig. 7 illustrates a
configuration example of a plurality                   of pieces of indication
data stored in the storage apparatus 307 of the distribution
server 101.           Fig.    8 illustrates an example of an invoice.
 [0038]           In Fig. 5,     when the mobile terminal 105 firstly            sends
a gas meter reading processing                 request for a meter reading
target       to the delivery server 101,         then the request is        received
by the CPU 301           (receiving unit     31)  of the delivery server 101
 (S101).        This request is      performed,     as shown in       Fig.  6,   using
indication        data including a meter reading slip               ID d61,    an area
code d62, a meter reader ID d63,                 a meter reading date d64, a
customer ID d65,            a meter number d66,    and a meter indication           d67
for example.
 [0039]           In   this    embodiment,   the gas meter is         attached with
a   QR     code      (readable     information     code) .       Thus,   the    mobile
terminal 105 can read the QR code to acquire the respective
pieces of indication             data except for      the meter indication          and
the meter reading date.              The meter indication          shown in     Fig.  6
is   acquired based on an input operation of a meter reader for
example and the meter reading date is a date on which the QR
code        is read for example.
 [0040]           When the CPU 301 (receiving unit             31)  of the delivery
server 101 receives from the mobile terminal 105 the request
                                           13=

using the indication                  data on the meter reading date,             then the
CPU 301 stores           the indication           data in   the storage apparatus 307.
This storage example is                    shown in      Fig.  7.   As shown in     Fig.   7,
the database d70 of the storage apparatus 307 stores                          a plurality
of pieces of indication data received by the CPU 301.
 [0041]             Upon receiving the above-described request,                     the CPU
301     (calculation            unit   32)   of the delivery server 101 performs
meter reading processing depending on the request to calculate
the gas fee of the customer based on the meter reading of the
present month              (S102).
 [0042]              In  this      meter reading processing,           the gas usage is
calculated based on the indication data on the present meter
reading date            (e.g.,       March 30)      used in    the request in     S101 and
the indication            data used in        the request received on the previous
meter reading date (e.g.,                   February 28).         The storage apparatus
307 stores the indication data on the previous meter reading
date      (Fig.     7) .    Thus,     the CPU 301 reads the indication              data on
the previous meter reading date from the storage apparatus 307.
 [0043]             The meter reading processing in                  S102 is   performed,
for example,            by performing {(the meter indication                  included in
the indication data of the present meter reading date)-(the
meter indication               included in the indication           data of the previous
meter reading date)} to calculate                         the gas usage corresponding
to a period from the previous meter reading date to the present
meter reading              date.        Based      on   the   gas  usage,    the   CPU    301
calculates          the gas fee of the customer based on the meter reading
of the present month.                   In   this     embodiment,    the gas fee of the
                                                    14-

customer based on the meter reading of the present month is                       set
to be an amount calculated,           for example,      based on a formula of
 (basic fee )+(unit fee)x(gas usage)               (e.g.,     5000yen).
 [0044]         Furthermore,    in  S103 of Fig.     5,  the CPU 301 (payment
situation      confirmation    unit     33)   of  the delivery          server    101
refers     to the table   of Fig. 4A for example to determine whether
the customer has an unpaid fee or not.               With reference to Fig.
4A,     the customer having the customer ID A001 has an unpaid gas
fee      corresponding     to two     months.      Thus,     this     customer      is
determined as having an unpaid fee               ("Yes"    in     S103) .  In   this
case, the CPU 301 reads from the table of Fig. 4A the unpaid
fee corresponding to the customer ID                (e.g.,     4000yen)     (S104).
 [0045]         Furthermore,    in  the processing to determine whether
there is anunpaid fee in S103,         the CPU301 (thepayment situation
confirmation unit 33) also may refer to the table of Fig. 4B
for example to determine whether the customer has an unpaid fee
 (or an unpaid gas appliance cost) or not.                  With reference to
Fig. 4B,     the customer having the customer ID A001 has an unpaid
gas appliance cost of         3600yen.       Thus, the CPU 301 reads the
unpaid cost (e.g.,        3600 yen)    from the table       of Fig.     4B (S104).
When there is     no unpaid fee in        the determination in          S103   ("No"
in S103,      then the processing proceeds from S103 to S105.
 [0046]         Next,   the CPU 301 (issuing unit         34)     of the delivery
server issues the invoice information including the gas fee
calculated in S102 based on the meter reading of the present
month (e.g.,      5000yen) and the unpaid fee read in S104                    (e.g.,
4000yen).       Furtheremore,      in   this   embodiment,          since  the    gas
                                       -15=

appliance cost of 3600yen is unpaid for example, the CPU 301
causes       the   invoice        information         to    include       this       unpaid    gas
appliance cost.
 [0047]           Then,     the CPU 301 (transmission unit                    35)     sends this
invoice information to the mobile terminal 105                                    (S106).
 [0048]           When       the     mobile         terminal        105        receives        the
above-described invoice information,                           the mobile terminal 105
instructs       a printer        (not shown) for example to print                     an invoice
based on this         information          (S107).        As a result,          the printer       1
is   caused,      as illustrated          in   Fig.     8,   to print       the invoice 200
including the gas usage notice 201 showing the meter reading
details and the gas fee payment slip 202.                              In the example of
the meter reading details               201 of Fig. 8,          the total       billed    amount
dl(=d2+d3) is printed that is obtained by adding the gas fee
dl corresponding to the gas usage (in                      this   embodiment,          the total
of dl=the gas fee corresponding to the meter reading of the
present month (e.g.,              500Oyen) +the unpaid gas fee corresponding
to the previous month meter reading (e.g., 4000yen))                                     and the
unpaid gas appliance cost d2                      (e.g.,      5000yen)).
 [0049]           In the example of the gas fee bill 202 of Fig. 8,
the gas fee bill          202 includes the above-described billed                         amount
dl and a barcode 203 and is                printed       based on a format to enable
the     payment      based       on  previously-specified                 payment        methods
 (payment at       a convenience store              or at     a post office).            In  this
case, the previously-specified payment methods are stored in
the storage apparatus 307 to be associated with the customer
ID.       In  the processing           of    S105     of    Fig.    5  to      issue     invoice
                                               -16-

information, the CPU 301 reads the payment method corresponding
to the customer ID to issue invoice information including the
payment method.        As described above, an operation is               performed
to issue an invoice regarding the gas fee or the gas appliance.
 [0050]        As described above, during the gas meter reading,
the delivery server 101 of this           embodiment sends,          to the mobile
terminal 105,       the invoice information including the present
month meter reading and the unpaid gas fee.                       Thus, the meter
reading operation and the invoicing operation can be performed
simultaneously,         thus  achieving         an  efficient        operation      to
invoice a gas fee including an unpaid gas fee.
 [0051]        Furthermore,    since the invoice information includes
an unpaid gas appliance cost also, an invoicing operation to
customers can be carried out more efficiently.
 [0052]      As described above, an embodiment has been described.
However,    a specific     data structure         for example is       not limited
to the embodiment and also may be changed.                  For example,     in  S104
of Fig.  5,   an example was shown in            which an unpaid fee is          read
when such an unpaid fee exists.            However,      another configuration
also may be used in which an unpaid fee is read only when an
unpaid period is       longer than a predetermined period (e.g.,                   one
week has passed since the payment deadline).
 [0053]        A  case    was  described         in  which      the   invoice      200
included     the   meter    reading     details      201      and  the  bill     202.
However, the invoice 200 may be printed in arbitrary layout,
format, and contents so long as customers can be notified of
the gas fee charge details        generated during a gas meter reading
                                       -17=

that    include the gas fee based on the meter reading of the present
month and the unpaid gas fee.             For example,       the meter reading
details     201 and the bill    202 may be printed         separately so that
only the bill 202 is handled as the              invoice 200.
Modification Example 1
         Description has not provided above for replacement                      of a
gas meter.      However, at the time of meter reading processing
after     the replacement of the gas meter,            a situation       for a gas
fee payment may be determined and then information for charging
an unpaid fee may be provided.
         Next, explanation will     be provided for an exemplary action
of the server 101      for achievement of the above process.
         Firstly, with reference to Figs. 9 and 10,                  explanation
will     be provided   for    data   processed      within       the  server      101
 (master data of a gas meter and data on caloric                value of a gas).
         Fig. 9 illustrates an exemplary table d90 with caloric
value of a gas type to be described below.                    The table d90 is
stored by the storage apparatus 307.
         In the example of the table       d90,  as shown in        Fig.  9,  items
such as a meter number d91,        caloric    value d92,        and so forth      are
associated with each other.           The meter number d91 of Fig.               9 is
identical to the meter number d32 of Fig. 3.
         Caloric value of a supplied gas         (e.g.,     Kcal/m 3 ) is    set   as
a value of the caloric       value d92.      A gas type such as Liquefied
Petroleum      Gas   (LPG)    or   Liquefied      Natural         Gas    (LNG)     is
distinguishable according to the caloric value of the gas.
                                      -18=

           Fig.   10     illustrates          an   exemplary       table     d100    of  fees
classified        according to the caloric                  value.      The table     d100 is
stored by the storage apparatus                        307.
           As shown in Fig. 10,               caloric value d101 and a fee d102
stored in       the table           d100 are associated with each other.                   The
caloric      value d101 of Fig.              10 is  identical      to the caloric       value
d92 of Fig.         9.      Examples of a fee to be set                 as a value of the
fee d102 include a basic fee and a unit fee.
           Next, withreference toFigs.                 2, 4A, 5,     8 toi0, explanation
will     be providedfor the process performed after                       the replacement
of a gas meter described above.
           For example,          when the caloric          value of a gas is          changed
and the type of              the gas is changed from "LPG" to "LNG, " the
customer's gas meter should be replaced.                          That is,     the gas meter
for "LPG"       (existing          one) is    replaced with a gas meter for "LNG"
 (new one).        In   this       case,   in  the process of Fig.          5,   the CPU 301
receives a meter reading processing request of the gas meter
for      "LNG"    on     a    meter      reading      date     (step     S101) .     In  this
modification example,                 the CPU 301 also uses indication              data d60
of Fig. 6,      and receives information relating                     to the new gas meter
for      "LNG" from the mobile terminal                       105.     In this     case,   the
indication         data        d60    of    Fig.    6   includes       a   "meter    number"
corresponding to the gas meter for "LNG. "                          The CPU 301 receives
information on the gas meter for                          "LNG" installed after the
replacement          (for example, a slip ID d61,                   an area code d62, a
meter reader d63,               a meter reading date d64,              a customer ID d65,
a meter number d66, a meter indication d67 and so forth).
                                                -19=

           Next,     the CPU 301 calculate            a gas fee in        the same manner
as     in   the     processing         in   step   S102     of   Fig.    5  by using     the
indication          data of the gas meter for "LNG".                 In the modification
as an example, the caloric value of the gas used after the
replacement of the existing gas meter is different from that
of the new one.              The CPU 301 reads fee data corresponding to
the caloric          value of the gas type "LNG"               from the table       d100 of
Fig.      10 before the calculation.                In this     case, firstly,      the CPU
301 determines, for instance, the gas usage in a period from
the replacement of a gas meter to the present meter reading date
based on formula             (1)    of (the meter indication              included in    the
indication          data of the new gas meter for which the request has
been received in             S101)      -  (the meter indication           of the new gas
meter at       the time of replacement) .               It   should be noted that        the
meter       indication        of     the    new   gas   meter     at    the   time   of  the
replacement is           stored in        the storage apparatus 307 in             advance.
The CPU 301 reads the meter indication,                        and then refers        to the
table d90 of Fig. 9 to identify the caloric value of the gas
type       "LNG" corresponding to               the meter number.              The CPU 301
refers       to the table        d100 of Fig.      10 to determine a gas fee based
on meter reading processing of the new gas meter by using a fee
corresponding to the caloric                   value of the gas type "LNG. "             For
example,        the gas fee is        determined based on formula (2)             of (basic
fee for the caloric              value of "LNG")        + (unit      fee for the caloric
value of         "LNG")    x   (gas usage determined based on formula                    (1)
above).
           Furthermore,          in    Fig.    5,   the     CPU   301     determines     the
                                               =20=

customer payment situation at the time of the meter reading
processing       of   the      gas   meter       for    "LPG"   used     before      the
replacement       based      on    information         related    to   the     payment
situation      d44 of the gas fee ("paid" or "unpaid")                  in   the table
d40A of Fig.      4A (step S103).          When the customer has an unpaid
fee, the CPU 301 reads the gas fee at               the time of the meter reading
processing of the gas meter for "LPG"                     (step S104) .     Next,    the
CPU 301 generates, as information for charging the customer,
the gas fee applied on the present meter reading date when the
gas meter for "LNG" is          used (the processing result             of S102)     and
the gas fee read in          step S104 at        the time of the meter reading
processing of the gas meter for "LPG"                   (step S105) .      The CPU 301
outputs the information to the mobile terminal 105 (step S106).
This allows the mobile terminal 105 to receive the information
from the server 101 and print               the information as shown in              the
example of Fig.        8.
          By performing such a process,               information for use in         gas
fee payment can be provided, for instance, at the time of a
monthly gas meter reading, even if an existing gas meter is
replaced with a new gas meter which handles a different gas
caloric value.
