  VARIABLE HYDRAULIC PRESSURE RELIEF SYSTEMS AND METHODS
                        FOR A MATERIAL HANDLING VEHICLE
CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]       The present application is based on, claims priority to, and incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety, United States Provisional Patent Application No. 62/446,973, filed on
January 17, 2017, and entitled "Variable Hydraulic Pressure Relief Systems and Methods for a
Material Handling Vehicle."
STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH
[0002]       Not Applicable.
BACKGROUND
[0003]       The present invention relates generally       to hydraulic lift systems and, more
specifically, to hydraulic pressure relief systems and methods on material handling vehicles
(MHVs).
[0004]       Hydraulic relief systems on MHVs typically utilize various pressure relief systems to
ensure that the hydraulic fluid doesn't build to a pressure above a predetermined pressure. This
predetermined pressure can be calculated based on physical properties (e.g., buckling force,
maximum operating pressure, etc.) of the hydraulic components on the MHV (e.g., pistons,
valves, fluid paths, etc.).
[0005]       In a MHV, for example, a hydraulic lift system may be used to raise and lower a fork
assembly that is holding a load. Typically, these hydraulic lift systems are provided with a range
of predetermined pressures that correspond to how much load the fork assembly can support at a
given height, or fork elevation.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006]       The present invention provides a hydraulic control system for a material handling
vehicle including one or more hydraulic actuators configured to raise and lower a fork assembly
attached to a mast of the material handling vehicle. The hydraulic control system provides multi
stage pressure relief.
[0007]       In one aspect, the present invention provides a hydraulic control system for a material
handling vehicle.     The material handling vehicle includes a pump having a pump outlet, a
QB\50260465.1

reservoir, one or more hydraulic actuators, and a controller.         The pump outlet is in fluid
communication with a supply passage and the reservoir is in fluid communication with a return
passage. The one or more hydraulic actuators are configured to raise and lower a fork assembly
attached to a mast of the material handling vehicle. The hydraulic control system comprises a
high pressure relief valve, a low pressure relief valve, and a low pressure control valve. The high
pressure relief valve is configured to provide fluid communication from the supply passage to the
reservoir when a pressure upstream of the high pressure relief valve exceeds a high pressure
threshold.    The low pressure relief valve is arranged on a low pressure relief line, the low
pressure relief line connected between the supply passage and the return passage upstream of the
high pressure relief valve.      The low pressure relief valve is configured to provide fluid
communication from the supply passage to the reservoir when a pressure upstream of the low
pressure relief valve exceeds a low pressure threshold.         The low pressure control valve is
arranged on the low pressure relief line upstream of the low pressure relief valve, the low
pressure   control valve moveable       between     a control   valve open position where      fluid
communication is provided from the supply passage to the low pressure relief valve and a control
valve closed position where fluid communication is inhibited from the supply passage to the low
pressure control valve. The low pressure threshold is less than the high pressure threshold and
the low pressure control valve is moveable between the control valve open position and the
control valve closed position when the fork assembly reaches a predetermined elevated height.
[0008]       In another aspect, the present invention provides a hydraulic control system for a
material handling vehicle. The material handling vehicle includes a pump having a pump outlet,
a reservoir, one or more hydraulic actuators, and a controller.        The pump outlet is in fluid
communication with a supply passage and the reservoir is in fluid communication with a return
passage. The one or more hydraulic actuators are configured to raise and lower a fork assembly
attached to a mast of the material handling vehicle. The controller is in communication with a
height sensor configured to measure a height of the fork assembly. The hydraulic control system
comprises a variable pressure relief valve configured to provide fluid communication from the
supply passage to the reservoir when a pressure upstream of the variable pressure relief valve
exceeds a variable pressure threshold.     The variable pressure threshold is set by the controller
based on a height of the fork assembly.

following description. In the description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which
form a part hereof, and in which there is shown by way of illustration a preferred embodiment of

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0026]        The use of the terms "downstream" and "upstream" herein are terms that indicate
direction relative to the flow of a fluid. The term "downstream" corresponds to the direction of
fluid flow, while the term "upstream" refers to the direction opposite or against the direction of
fluid flow.
[0027]       It is also to be appreciated that material handling vehicles (MHVs) are designed in a
variety of configurations to perform a variety of tasks. Although the MHV described herein is
shown by way of example as a reach truck, it will be apparent to those of skill in the art that the
present invention is not limited to vehicles of this type, and can also be provided in various other
types of MHV configurations, including for example, orderpickers, swing reach vehicles, and
any other lift vehicles. The various pressure relief configurations are suitable for both driver
controlled, pedestrian controlled and remotely controlled MHVs.
[0028]       The various hydraulic components of hydraulic lift systems of MHVs are sized to
withstand a predetermined load, or pressure, at a specified height. Once the MHV's required
capabilities are determined, the various hydraulic components can be sized appropriately.
Typically, various lift ratings are provided, each corresponding to how high the material
handling vehicles fork assembly can be raised under different loading situations.
[0029]       Current single-stage hydraulic pressure relief systems on MHVs are generally set to
relieve system pressure at slightly above a predetermined hydraulic pressure that can be exerted
on the system. This predetermined hydraulic pressure typically corresponds to a predetermined
load at a fork height that is below a maximum fork height. Manufacturers size the various
                                                   -4
QB\50260465. 1

Attorney Docket No. 780139.00884
hydraulic components to withstand worst-case scenarios, which arise from the single-stage relief
capabilities of the hydraulic system. This can cause component sizing increases that ultimately
result in higher costs. It may be desirable to improve the hydraulic pressure relief systems on
MHVs to allow for multi-stage hydraulic pressure relief that can provide a lower pressure relief
threshold at higher elevations.        This can allow for the manufacturer to provide hydraulic
components that are sized for intended uses, and are thereby less costly to produce.
[0030]       Fig. 1 illustrates an MHV 100 in the form of a reach truck according to one non
limiting example of the present disclosure. The MHV 100 can include a base 102, a telescoping
mast 104, one or more hydraulic actuators 106, and a fork assembly 108. The telescoping mast
104 can be coupled to the hydraulic actuators 106 such that the hydraulic actuators 106 can
selectively extend or retract the telescoping mast 104. The fork assembly 108 can be coupled to
the telescoping mast 104 so that when the telescoping mast 104 is extended or retracted, the fork
assembly 108 can also be raised or lowered. The fork assembly 108 can further include one or
more forks 110 on which various loads (not shown) can be manipulated or carried by the MHV
100.
[0031]       Fig. 2 illustrates a current hydraulic circuit 200 with a single-stage relief system that
can be used to control the hydraulic actuator 106 of the MHV 100. It should be appreciated that
the current hydraulic circuit 200 can also be used to control other hydraulic components on the
MHV 100.
[0032]       The current hydraulic circuit 200 can include a motor 204, a hydraulic pump 206, and
a reservoir tank 208. The motor 204 can drive the hydraulic pump 206 to draw fluid from the
reservoir tank 208 and furnish the fluid under increased pressure at a pump outlet 209.           The
pump outlet 209 can be in fluid communication with a supply passage 212. A first control valve
214, a second control valve 216, and a pressure sensor 217 can be arranged on the supply
passage 212 with the first control valve 214 arranged upstream of the second control valve 216
and the pressure sensor 217 arranged downstream of the second control valve 216. A return
passage 215 can provide fluid communication from a location downstream of the second control
valve 216 to the reservoir tank 208. The first and second control valves 214 and 216 and the
pressure sensor 217 can be in electrical communication with a controller 218.
[0033]       During operation, the controller 218 can be configured to selectively actuate the first
control valve 214 and/or the second control valve 216 to direct fluid flow between the hydraulic
actuators 106, the supply passage 212, and the reservoir tank 208.             In some non-limiting
examples, the hydraulic actuators 106 can be in the form of a piston-cylinder arrangement. It is
                                                  -5
QB\50260465. 1

Attorney Docket No. 780139.00884
known in the art that lift cylinders can include a head side and a rod side. The first and second
control valves 214 and 216 can be selectively actuated to either direct pressurized fluid from the
hydraulic pump 206 to the head side or the rod side, with the other of the two sides connected to
the reservoir tank 208. This selective actuation can determine whether the hydraulic actuators
 106 extend or retract.
[0034]       A variable orifice 220 can be arranged on the return passage 215 at a location
upstream of the reservoir tank 208. The variable orifice 220 can be configured to build pressure
at a location downstream of the hydraulic actuators 106 and upstream of the reservoir tank 208
on the return passage 215 to ensure the hydraulic actuators 106 retract at a predetermined rate.
[0035]       A pressure relief line 222 can provide fluid communication from the supply passage
212 at a location upstream of the first control valve 214 to the return passage 215 at a location
downstream of the variable orifice 220.       A pressure relief valve 224 can be arranged on the
pressure relief line 222. The pressure relief valve 224 can be biased into a first position where
fluid communication is inhibited across the pressure relief valve 224 from the supply passage
212 to the return passage 215. The pressure relief valve 224 can be biased into a second position
when a pressure upstream of the pressure relief valve 224 is greater than a pressure relief
threshold 302 (Fig. 3).   In the second position, the pressure relief valve 224 can provide fluid
communication from the supply passage 212 to the return passage 215, thereby relieving the
pressure applied to the components of the current hydraulic circuit 200.
[0036]       Fig. 3 shows a graph 300 illustrating a relationship between the pressure relief
threshold 302 of the pressure relief valve 224 and a predetermined system pressure 304 of the
hydraulic circuit 200 as a function of elevated height of the fork assembly 108.                   The
predetermined system pressure 304 corresponds to the pressure within the supply passage 212,
when the MHV 100 is lifting a predetermined load capacity for a given elevated height of the
fork assembly 108. As illustrated, the predetermined system pressure 304 initially increases to
an uppermost predetermined system pressure 306 and then decreases at higher elevations. Due
to the single-stage nature (i.e., one, constant relief pressure) of the current hydraulic circuit 200,
the pressure relief threshold 302 of the pressure relief valve 224 stays constant, at slightly above
the uppermost predetermined system pressure 306 for all elevated heights of the fork assembly
108.
[0037]       Fig. 4 shows one embodiment of a hydraulic circuit 400 similar to the current
hydraulic circuit 200, with similar parts labeled with like numbers in the 400 series, which can be
used with the MHV 100 of Fig. 1. The hydraulic circuit 400 includes a controller 418 in
                                                 -6

communication with height sensor 444, which can sense an elevation height of fork assembly
 108, and an additional circuit component 446, which can comprise a multitude of varying
elements that can be implemented to allow for multi-stage or variable pressure relief, as will be
described below.
[00381       Fig. 5 shows one embodiment of a selective low pressure relief system 500 that can
be implemented into the hydraulic circuit 400 of Fig. 4 as the additional circuit component 446.
The selective low pressure relief system 500 can provide fluid communication between the
supply passage 412 and the return passage 415, to allow for dual-stage pressure relief. The
selective low pressure relief system 500 can include a relief control valve 502 and a low pressure
relief valve 504. The relief control valve 502 can be arranged upstream of the low pressure relief
valve 504 and can be selectively moveable by the controller 418 between an open position and a
closed position. In the open position, the relief control valve 502 can be configured to permit
fluid flow from the supply passage 412 to the low pressure relief valve 504. In the closed
position, the relief control valve 502 can be configured to inhibit fluid flow from the supply
passage 412 to the low pressure relief valve 504. The relief control valve 502 can be actuated
between the open and closed positions by a solenoid 506.             The solenoid 506 can be in
communication with the controller 418.        The low pressure relief valve 504 can have a low
pressure relief threshold setting 706 that is lower than a pressure relief threshold setting 702 of
the pressure relief valve 424, as will be described with reference to Fig. 7.
[0039]       Fig. 6 illustrates one non-limiting example of steps for switching between a high
pressure setting and a low pressure setting while using the hydraulic circuit 400 of Fig. 4 with the
selective low pressure relief system 500 implemented as the additional circuit component 446.
During operation, the controller 418 can measure, at step 600, the elevation height of the fork
assembly 108 using the height sensor 444. After measuring the elevation height at step 600, the
controller 418 can determine, at step 602, if the elevation height is above a threshold elevation
height 708 (shown in Fig. 7). If the controller 418 determines that the elevation height is above
the threshold elevation height 708, the controller 418 can actuate the relief control valve 502 to
the open position, at step 604. By actuating the relief control valve 502 to the open position,
fluid communication can be provided from the supply passage 412 to the low pressure relief
valve 504. Thus, once the hydraulic pressure in the supply passage 412 upstream of the first
control valve 414 exceeds the low pressure relief threshold setting 706 of the low pressure relief
valve 504, the low pressure relief valve 504 will open up and provide fluid communication from
the supply passage 412 to the return passage 415, thereby relieving the hydraulic pressure within
                                                 -7
QB\50260465. 1

Attorney Docket No. 780139.00884
the supply passage 412. If the controller 418 alternatively determines that the elevation height is
not above the threshold elevation height 708, the controller 418 can instead actuate the relief
control valve 502 to the closed position, at step 606, or if the relief control valve 502 is already
in the closed position, it can maintain the relief control valve 502 in this position. With the relief
control valve 502 in the closed position, the hydraulic fluid cannot enter the selective low
pressure relief system 500. Therefore, the hydraulic pressure in the supply passage 412 cannot
be relieved until it reaches the pressure relief threshold setting 702 of the pressure relief valve
424 within the pressure relief line 422.
[00401       Fig. 7 shows a graph 700 illustrating the relationship between the pressure relief
threshold setting 702, the low pressure relief threshold setting 706, and a predetermined system
pressure 704 of the hydraulic circuit 400 as a function of elevation height of the fork assembly
108.    The predetermined system pressure 704 is similar to the predetermined system pressure
304 of graph 300. However, with this dual-stage pressure relief provided by the selective low
pressure relief system 500, the pressure relief threshold setting 702 drops to the low pressure
relief threshold setting 706 once the fork assembly exceeds the threshold elevation height 708.
This can aid in preventing the heaviest loads from exceeding the threshold elevation height 708
and, thereby, the various hydraulic components may be sized accordingly.
[0041]       Fig. 8 shows one embodiment of a selective low pressure relief system 800 that can
be implemented into the hydraulic circuit 400 of Fig. 4 as the additional circuit component 446.
The selective low pressure relief system 800 can provide fluid communication between the
supply passage 412 and the return passage 415, to allow for multi-stage pressure relief. The
selective low pressure relief system 800 can include a first relief fluid path 808 including a first
relief control valve 810 and a first low pressure relief valve 812 similar to the relief control valve
502 and the low pressure relief valve 504 of the selective low pressure relief system 500. The
selective low pressure relief system 800 can further include a second relief fluid path 814
arranged parallel to the first relief fluid path 808 and including a second relief control valve 816
and a second low pressure relief valve 818. The first low pressure relief valve 812 can have a
first low pressure relief threshold setting 1010 that is lower than the pressure relief threshold
setting 702 of the pressure relief valve 424, as will be described below with reference to Fig. 10.
The second low pressure relief valve 818 can have a second low pressure relief threshold setting
 1012 that is lower than the first low pressure relief threshold setting 1010, as will also be
described below with reference to Fig. 10. The first and second relief control valves 810, 816
can be selectively moveable between open and closed positions similar to the relief control valve
                                                  -8

502 of the selective low pressure relief system 500. Additionally, the first and second relief
control valves 810, 816 can be actuated between their respective open and closed positions by
first and second solenoids 820, 822 respectively.      Furthermore, the first and second solenoids
820, 822 can also be in communication with the controller 418.
[00421        Fig. 9 illustrates one non-limiting example of the steps for switching between a high
pressure setting, a middle pressure setting, and a low pressure setting while using the hydraulic
circuit 400 of Fig. 4 with the selective low pressure relief system 800 implemented as the
additional circuit component 446. During operation, the controller 418 can measure, at step 900,
the elevation height of the fork assembly 108 using the height sensor 444. After measuring the
elevation height at step 900, the controller 418 can determine, at step 902, if the elevation height
is above a first threshold elevation height 1014 (shown in Fig. 10).           If the controller 418
determines that the elevation height is not above the first threshold elevation height 1014, the
controller 418 can actuate the first and second relief control valves 810, 816 to their closed
positions, at step 904, or maintain the first and second relief control valves 810, 816 in the closed
positions. By actuating or maintaining the first and second relief control valves 810, 816 in their
closed positions, hydraulic fluid cannot enter the first or second relief fluid paths 808, 814 of the
selective low pressure relief system 800. Therefore, the hydraulic pressure in the supply passage
412 cannot be relieved until it meets or exceeds the pressure relief threshold setting 702 of the
pressure relief valve 424 within the pressure relief fluid path 420, as described above.
[0043]       Alternatively, if the controller 418 determines that the elevation height is above the
first threshold elevation height 1014, the controller 418 can actuate the first relief control valve
810 to the open position, at step 906. By actuating the first relief control valve 810 to the open
position, fluid communication can be provided from the supply passage 512 to the first low
pressure relief valve 812. Thus, once the hydraulic pressure in the supply passage 412 upstream
of the first control valve 414 exceeds the first low pressure relief threshold setting 1010 of the
first low pressure relief valve 812, the first low pressure relief valve 812 will open and provide
fluid communication from the supply passage 412 to the return passage 415, thereby relieving
the hydraulic pressure within the supply passage 412.        After actuating the first relief control
valve 810 to the open position, the controller 418 can then determine if the elevation height is
above a second threshold elevation height 1016 (shown in Fig. 10), at step 908. If the controller
418 determines that the elevation height is above the second threshold elevation height 1016, the
controller 418 can actuate the second relief control valve 816 to the open position, at step 910.
Similarly, by actuating the second relief control valve 816 to the open position, fluid
                                                  -9

Attorney Docket No. 780139.00884
communication can be provided from the supply passage 412 to the second low pressure relief
valve 818.    Thus, once the hydraulic pressure in the supply passage 412 upstream of the first
control valve 414 exceeds the second low pressure relief threshold setting 1012 of the second
low pressure relief valve 818, the second low pressure relief valve 818 will open up and provide
fluid communication from the supply passage 412 to the return passage 412. If the controller
418 alternatively determines that the elevation height is not above the second threshold elevation
height 1016, the controller 418 can instead actuate the second relief control valve 816 to the
closed position or maintain the second relief control valve 816 in the closed position, at step 912.
By actuating or maintaining the second relief control valve 816 to or in the closed position, the
hydraulic fluid cannot enter the second relief fluid path 814. Therefore, the hydraulic pressure in
the supply passage 412 will not be relieved until it meets or exceeds the first low pressure relief
threshold setting 1010 of the first low pressure relief valve 812, as described above.
[0044]       Fig. 10 shows a graph 1000 illustrating the relationship between the pressure relief
threshold setting 702 of the pressure relief valve 424, the first and second low pressure relief
threshold settings 1010, 1012, and the predetermined system pressure 704 of the hydraulic circuit
400 as a function of elevation height of the fork assembly 108.          The predetermined system
pressure 704 is again similar to the predetermined system pressure 304 of graph 300. With the
multi-stage pressure relief, the pressure relief threshold setting 702 drops to the first low pressure
relief threshold setting 1010 once the hydraulic actuator 106 exceeds the first threshold elevation
height 1014. The first low pressure relief threshold setting 1010 then drops to the second low
pressure relief threshold setting 1012 once the hydraulic actuator 106 exceeds the second
threshold elevation height 1016.      This can further aid in preventing the heaviest loads from
exceeding the threshold elevation heights 1014, 1016 and, thereby, the various hydraulic
components may be sized accordingly.
[0045]       Fig. 11 shows one embodiment of a variable pressure relief system 1100 that can be
implemented into the hydraulic circuit of Fig. 4 as the additional circuit component 446. The
variable pressure relief system 1100 can provide fluid communication between the supply
passage 412 and the return passage 415, to allow for variable pressure relief. The variable
pressure relief system 1100 can include a variable pressure relief fluid path 1124 including a
variable pressure relief valve 1126. The variable pressure relief valve 1126 can be operated by a
solenoid 1134 that is in communication with the controller 418. The variable pressure relief
valve 1126 can have a variable pressure relief threshold setting 1302 (illustrated in Fig. 13),
which can be variably set by actuating the solenoid 1134 to various positions to provide various

pressure thresholds based on the predetermined capacities at varying elevations, as will be
described below.
[0046]       Fig. 12 illustrates one non-limiting example of the steps for adjusting between
pressure thresholds while using the hydraulic circuit 400 of Fig. 4 with the variable pressure
relief system 1100 implemented as the additional circuit component 446. During operation, the
controller 418 can measure, at step 1200, the elevation height of the fork assembly 108 using the
height sensor 444. After measuring the elevation height at step 1200, the controller 418 can
determine, at step 1202, if the elevation height is above a first threshold elevation height 1314
(shown in Fig. 13), similar to the first threshold elevation height 1014 of Fig. 10.          If the
controller 418 determines that the elevation height is not above the first threshold elevation
height 1314, the controller 418 can actuate the solenoid 1134 to a first location to provide a first
pressure threshold 1306, at step 1204. If the controller 418 determines that the elevation height
is above the first threshold elevation height 1314, the controller 418 can then determine, at step
 1206, if the elevation height is above a second threshold elevation height 1316, similar to the
second threshold elevation height 1016 of Fig. 10.        If the controller 418 determines that the
elevation height is not above the second threshold elevation height 1316, the controller 418 can
actuate the solenoid 1134 to a second location to provide a second pressure threshold 1308, at
step 1208.     If the controller 418 determines that the elevation height is above the second
threshold elevation height 1316, the controller 418 can then determine, at step 1210, if the
elevation height is above a third threshold elevation height 1318.            If the controller 418
determines that the elevation height is not above the third threshold elevation height 1318, the
controller 418 can actuate the solenoid 1134 to a third location to provide a third pressure
threshold 1310, at step 1212. If the controller 418 determines that the elevation height is above
the third threshold elevation height 1318, the controller 418 can determine, at step 1214, if the
elevation height is above a fourth threshold elevation height 1320.           If the controller 418
determines that the elevation height is not above the fourth threshold elevation height 1320, the
controller 418 can actuate the solenoid 1134 to a fourth location to provide a fourth pressure
threshold 1312, at step 1216. If the controller 418 determines that the elevation height is above
the fourth threshold elevation height 1320, the controller 418 can actuate the solenoid 1134 to a
fifth location to provide a firth pressure threshold 1313, at step 1218.
[0047]       Fig. 13 shows a graph 1300 illustrating the relationship between the variable pressure
relief threshold setting 1302 and the predetermined system pressure 704 of the hydraulic circuit
400 versus various elevation heights. Again, the predetermined system pressure 704 is similar to
QB\50260465.1

Attorney Docket No. 780139.00884
the predetermined system pressure 304 of graph 300.         With the variable pressure relief, the
variable pressure relief threshold setting 1302 follows the predetermined system pressure 704 by
comparing the measured elevation height to the predetermined threshold elevation heights and
correspondingly adjusting the variable pressure relief threshold setting 1302 to the first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth pressure thresholds 1306, 1308, 1310, 1312, 1313 at the first, second,
third, and fourth elevation heights 1314, 1316, 1318, 1320.        This automatic adjustment can
further aid in allowing the various hydraulic components to be sized accordingly. It should be
appreciated that the number of pressure thresholds and corresponding elevations heights shown
in Fig. 13 is not meant to be limiting in any way and, in other non-limiting examples, more or
less than five may be provided.
[0048]       Fig. 14 illustrates another non-limiting example of the steps for adjusting between
pressure thresholds while using the hydraulic circuit 400 of Fig. 4 with the variable pressure
relief system 1100 implemented as the additional circuit component 446. During operation, the
controller 418 can measure, at step 1400, the elevation height of the fork assembly 108 using the
height sensor 444.     Simultaneously, or consecutively, the controller 418 can measure, at step
1402, a system pressure 1504 using the pressure sensor 417.          The controller 418 can then
determine, by comparing the measured elevation height and system pressure to preset values
corresponding to the various lift ratings, if the system pressure is above the predetermined
system pressure 704 for the elevation height, at step 1404. If the controller 418 determines that
the system pressure is higher than the predetermined system pressure 704 at step 1404, the
controller 418 can actuate the solenoid 1134 to a location to provide a pressure threshold
corresponding to the predetermined system pressure 704, at step 1406.        If the controller 418
determines, at step 1404, that the system pressure is lower than the predetermined system
pressure 704, the controller 418 can actuate the solenoid 1134 to a location to provide a
proportional pressure relief threshold setting 1502 that is slightly higher than the system
pressure, at step 1408.
[0049]       Fig. 15 shows a graph 1500 illustrating the relationship between the proportional
pressure relief threshold setting 1502, the predetermined system pressure 704, and an exemplary
system pressure 1504 versus various elevation heights. While the exemplary system pressure
1504 remains below the predetermined system pressure 704, the proportional pressure relief
threshold setting 1502 remains slightly above the system pressure 1504.          When the system
pressure 1504 exceeds the predetermined system pressure 704, the proportional pressure relief
threshold setting 1502 is set at the predetermined system pressure 704.
