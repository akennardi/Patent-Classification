                                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0021]        The disclosure is illustrated by way of example and not by way of
   limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which like reference
   numerals indicate similar elements.
10 [0022]       Referring to FIGS. 1-5, the nut cracker 100 in accordance with an
   exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure includes a main member 10, a
   gear cutter member 20, a clamping member 30, a stopping switch member 40 and a
   handle 50.     The gear cutter member 20 includes a gear cutter 22 rotatably
   connected to a first portion 10a of the main member 10.     The clamping member 30
15 includes a clamping bar 32 rotatably connected to a second portion l0b of the main
   member 10 and the stopping switch member 40 is also connected to the second
   portion 10b of the main member 10.       The first portion 10a and the second portion
   10b are opposite to each other.     A first handle portion 52 is extended downward
   from the second portion 1Gb of the main member 10 and connected to the clamping
20 bar 32 to cooperatively form the handle 50.       The clamping bar 32 can drive the
                                               6

   gear cutter 22 move when the handle 50 moves back and forth between a first state
   and a second state under an external force.     In the first state, a distance between
   the first handle portion 52 and the clamping bar 32 is minimum and the clamping
   bar 32 is meshed with the gear cutter 22, while in the second state, a distance
 5 between the first handle portion 52 and the clamping bar 32 is maximum and the
   clamping bar 32 is meshed with the stopping switch member 40 to prevent the gear
   cutter 22 from backing off.
   [0023]        Because the handle 50 can move back and forth between the first state
   and the second state by the external force so that the stopping switch member 40
10 can prevent the gear cutter 22 from backing off during use of the nut cracker 100,
   thereby the gear cutter 22 can apply a litter force on a nut to open it, which can
   avoid a problem of crushing the nut pulp due to excessive force.
   [0024]        Referring to FIG. 3 and FIG. 8, in an exemplary embodiment of the
   present disclosure, the clamping bar 32 includes a plurality of first teeth 320 at a
15 head portion thereof and the gear cutter 22 includes a plurality of second teeth 220
   at a bottom thereof.   In this way, the clamping bar 32 can drive the gear cutter 22
   move by the first tooth 320 meshing with a corresponding second tooth 220.          At
   the same time, a moving travel of the gear cutter 22 is proportional to a length of
   the second tooth 220, that is to say, the movement of the gear cutter 22 is
20 determined by the length of the plurality of second teeth 220.     When a last tooth of
                                              7

   the plurality of second teeth 220 is meshed with the corresponding first tooth 320,
   the gear cutter 22 can't further move, thereby preventing the gear cutter 22 from
   pressing against the nut again and avoiding nut pulp from being crushed by the gear
   cutter 22.
 5 [0025]        Referring to FIGS. 1-5, the clamping member 30 further includes a
   clamping shaft 34 connected to the second portion l0b of the main member 10 for

   recess 14 is a waist-shaped configuration, thereby the clamping shaft 34 can slide in
15 the receiving recess 14 so that the clamping bar 32 can mesh with or separate from
   the gear cutter 22.
   [0028]        In an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, resetting of the
   clamping bar 32 is meant that the clamping bar 32 can move from the first state to
   the second state under the action of the clamping spring 36.    That is, the distance
20 between the clamping bar 32 and the first handle portion 52 is maximum.
                                             8

   triangles is formed by connecting lines of the first locating post 71, the clamping
   shaft 34 and the first receiving groove 324.     The pair of triangles is respectively
10 formed between an outer surface of a corresponding main body 12 and a first
   receiving groove 324.
   [0037]         Because the triangle is formed by connecting lines of the first locating
   post 71, the clamping shaft 34 and the first receiving groove 324, thereby the
   clamping spring 36 can be firmly fixed.
15 [0038]         Referring to FIGS. 1-4, the nut cracker 100 further includes a
   receiving room 70 surrounded by the main member 10 and the gear cutter member
   20 for receiving a nut therein.    A volume of the receiving room 70 can change to
   open a shell of the nut when the handle 50 moves back and forth between the first
   state and the second state.
20 [0039]         In an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the volume of
                                              10

   the receiving room 70 can be changed according to a size of the nut.         So, the nut
   cracker 100 of the present disclosure can be applied to different nuts.     The present
   disclosure can open all kinds of nuts with only one nut cracker 100 at home,
   thereby greatly improving the convenience of use.
 5 [0040]        Furthermore, the minimum volume of the receiving room 70 of the
   present disclosure is greater than that of a user's finger.  That is to say, users can't
   accidentally injure their fingers when they use the nut cracker 100 of the present

20 of the handle 50 is defined as a closed state, while the second state of the handle 50
                                                15

   is defined as an opening state.      That is, the handle 50 can move between the
   opening state and the closed state.
   [0059]        In the course of use, the movement of the gear cutter 22 of the present
   disclosure is realized through opening and closing the handle 50, that is, it is
 5 achieved the purpose of energy saving through the principle of lever.
   [0060]        In use, the clamping spring 36 not only can reset the clamping bar 32,
   but also can drive the clamping bar 32 mesh with the gear cutter 22.    That is to say,
   the clamping spring 36 simultaneously has two functions: one function is to reset
   the clamping bar 32 and drive the handle 50 move between the opening state and
10 the closed state, the other function is to drive the clamping bar 32 mesh with the
   gear cutter 22 for achieving the purpose of cutting the nut shell.
   [0061]        The nut cracker 100 of the present disclosure is mainly used for crust
   breaking of macadamia nuts and other nuts, with a diameter of the nut between 4
   16- 4 32mm.     Of course, the nut cracker 100 of the present disclosure is also
