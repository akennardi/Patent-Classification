Provisional Patent Application No. 61/181,606, filed on 27 May 2009; each of which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]        Immune globulin products from human plasma were first used in 1952 to treat
immune deficiency. Initially, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of IgG were the
methods of choice. For injecting larger amounts of IgG necessary for effective treatment of
various diseases, however, the intravenous administrable products with lower concentrated IgG
(50mg/mL) were developed. Usually intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), contains the pooled
immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunoglobulins from the plasma of more than a thousand blood
donors. Typically containing more than 95% unmodified IgG, which has intact Fc-dependent
effector functions, and only trace amounts of immunoglobulin A (IgA) or immunoglobulin M
(IgM), IVIGs are sterile, purified IgG products primarily used in treating three main categories
of medical conditions: 1. immune deficiencies such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia,
hypogammaglobulinemia (primary immune deficiencies), and acquired compromised immunity
conditions (secondary immune deficiencies), featuring low antibody levels; 2. inflammatory
and autoimmune diseases; and 3. acute infections.
[0003]        A number of IVIG commercial suppliers provide a variety of IVIG products.
Compared to the older lyophilized IVIG products containing only 50mg/mL protein in the
solution after re-dissolving, the latest developments are 100mg/mL ready-for-use sterile, liquid
preparation of highly purified and concentrated human IgG antibodies. Since IgG products such
as IVIGs are manufactured from pooled human plasma, pathogen contamination (especially
viruses known to cause various diseases in human) from donor blood is a serious concern in the
production process. Another important consideration in IgG products is their stability during
storage, especially as ready-for-use preparations. Compared to IVIG, subcutaneously
administrable immunoglobulin preparations have the advantages of
                                                  1

   home-care treatment possibility and less side effects. To reduce the disadvantage of the small
   injection volume per site, a higher concentrated IgG (e.g., containing 200mg/mL instead of
    100mg/mL) would be a clear advantage.
   [00041     In the fourth installment of a series of seminal papers published on the preparation
 5 and properties of serum and plasma proteins, Cohn et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1946, 68(3):
   459-475) first described a methods for the alcohol fractionation of plasma proteins (method
   6), which allows for the isolation of a fraction enriched in IgG from human plasma. Several
   years later, Oncley et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1949, 71(2): 541-550) expanded upon the Cohn
   methods by publishing a method (method 9) that resulted in the isolation of a purer IgG
10 preparation.
    [0005]    These methods, while laying the foundation for an entire industry of plasma derived
   blood factors, were unable to provide IgG preparations having sufficiently high
    concentrations for the treatment of several immune-related diseases, including Kawasaki
    syndrome, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and primary immune deficiencies. As such,
15  additional methodologies employing various techniques, such as ion exchange
    chromatography, were developed to provide higher purity and higher concentration IgG
    formulations. Hoppe et al. (Munch Med Wochenschr 1967 (34): 1749-1752) and Falksveden
    (Swedish Patent No. 348942) and Falksveden and Lundblad (Methods ofPlasma Protein
    Fractionation1980) were among the first to employ ion exchange chromatography for this
20  purpose.
    [00061     Various modem methods employ a precipitation step, such as caprylate precipitation
    (Lebing et al., Vox Sang 2003 (84):193-201) and Cohn Fraction (I+)II+III ethanol
    precipitation (Tanaka et al., Braz JMed Biol Res 2000 (33)37-30) coupled to column
    chromatography. Most recently, Teschner et al. (Vox Sang, 2007 (92):42-55) have described
25  a method for production of a 10% IVIG product in which cryo-precipitate is first removed
    from pooled plasma and then a modified Cohn-Oncley cold ethanol fractionation is
    performed, followed by S/D treatment of the intermediate, ion exchange chromatography,
    nanofiltration, and optionally ultrafiltration/diafiltration.
     [0007]    However, despite the improved purity, safety, and yield afforded by these IgG
30  manufacturing methods, highly concentrated IgG preparations suitable for subcutaneous
     and/or intramuscular administration are still needed. The present invention fulfills these
     other needs and describes the manufacturing method of a stable, highly purified, virus
     inactivated, ready-to-use product with high concentration of IgG.

                              BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   [00081     In one aspect, the present invention provides an aqueous composition comprising
   more than about 180 grams of protein per liter of the composition, and at least 95% of the
 5 protein is IgG, such as human IgG. In some embodiments, the composition is produced by a
   process leading to a product suitable for subcutaneous and intravenous administration, and
   can be treated at elevated temperature in the final container to inactivate viruses regardless
   which concentration is adjusted between a concentration range of 10 to 22% of protein. In
   some cases, the protein concentration in the composition is at or about 20% (w/v). In other
10 cases, the composition may further comprise about 0.1-0.3 M glycine. The composition of
   this invention may have varying pH, such as about 3-6, or about 4-6.
   [0009]     In another aspect, this invention provides a method for preparing a composition of
   concentrated IgG from plasma with the improvement comprising the steps of: (1)
   concentrating protein in a plasma preparation to at or about 5% (w/v) by ultrafiltration; and
15 (2) further concentrating the protein in the preparation to at or about 20% (w/v) by
   diafiltration. At least 95% of the protein referred to in the composition is IgG, such as human
   IgG. In some embodiments, step (1) is performed using an ultrafiltration membrane with a
   nominal molecular weight cut off (NMWCO) of 100 kDa or less. In other embodiments, step
   (2) is performed against a diafiltration buffer of glycine with a pH of 4.2 ± 0.1. The
20 diafiltration buffer in some cases has 0.25 M glycine and a pH of 4.0. In some particular
   embodiments, the protein concentration after step (2) is higher than 20% (w/v) and is
   subsequently adjusted to at or about 20% (w/v) with a diafiltration buffer.

                    obtaining a filtrate by filtration;
 5          (8)     mixing a detergent and cold alcohol with the filtrate of (7) and
                    obtaining a precipitate by centrifugation;
            (9)     dissolving the precipitate in an aqueous solution comprising a solvent
                    or detergent and maintaining the solution for at least 60 minutes;
            (10)    passing the solution after (9) through a cation exchange
10                  chromatography column and eluting proteins absorbed on the column
                    in an eluate;
            (11)    passing the eluate from (10) through an anion exchange
                    chromatography column to generate an effluent;
            (12)    passing the effluent through a nanofilter to generate a nanofiltrate;
15          (13)    passing the nanofiltrate through an ultrafiltration membrane to generate
                     an ultrafiltrate;
             (14)    diafiltrating the ultrafiltrate against a diafiltration buffer to generate a
                     solution having a protein concentration of at or about 20% (w/v); and
             (15)    sterilizing the solution from (14) by filtering the solution through a
20                   filter of 0.2 pm or less, thereby obtaining a composition of
                     concentrated IgG.
                                                                                                  0
   [0011]      In some embodiments, step (2) is performed at a temperature of about -2 to 0 C; or
   the mixture of step (2) is mixed for at least 15 minutes and then maintained for at least 2
   hours at a temperature of about -2 to 00 C. In some embodiments, step (4) is mixed for at least
25 15 minutes and then maintained for at least 8 hours at a temperature of at or about -7'C. In
   some embodiments, the suspension of step (6) is stirred for about 40-160 minutes at a
   temperature of about 2*C to 8*C and a pH of at or about 5.0; or the silicon dioxide in step (7)
   is at a concentration of 40g/kg of the suspension of step (6) and the mixing is performed at a
   temperature of about 2 to 84C for at least about 50 minutes. In some embodiments, step (8) is

   a pH of 6.4 ± 0.2 and conductivity of about 1.5 to 2.5 mS/cm prior to step (11). In some
   embodiments, the effluent of step (11) is passed through a filter of 0.2 tm or smaller pore
 5 size prior to step (12). In some embodiments, the ultrafiltrate of step (13) has a protein
   concentration of at or about 5 ± 1%(w/v). In other embodiments, the ultrafiltration
   membrane of step (13) has a nominal molecular weight cut off (NMWCO) of 50 kDa or less.
   In some embodiments, the diafiltration buffer of step (14) is a 0.25 M glycine solution with a

                             BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
    [0015]     Figure 1 is a graphic illustration of the new ultrafiltration/diafiltration system.
30                                             DEFINITIONS
    [0016]     An "antibody"refers to a polypeptide substantially encoded by an immunoglobulin
    gene or immunoglobulin genes, or fragments thereof, which specifically bind and recognize

   an analyte (antigen). The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda,
   alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad
   immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda.
   Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the
 5 immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE, respectively.
   [00171      An exemplary immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit is composed of two pairs
   of polypeptide chains, each pair having one "light" (about 25 kD) and one "heavy" chain
   (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to
    110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable
10 light chain (VL) and variable heavy chain (VH) refer to these light and heavy chains
   respectively.
    [0018]     The term "ultrafiltration (UF)" encompasses a variety of membrane filtration
   methods in which hydrostatic pressure forces a liquid against a semi-permeable membrane.
   Suspended solids and solutes of high molecular weight are retained, while water and low
15 molecular weight solutes pass through the membrane. This separation process is often used
   for purifying and concentrating macromolecular (103 - 106 Da) solutions, especially protein
   solutions. A number of ultrafiltration membranes are available depending on the size of the
   molecules they retain. Ultrafiltration is typically characterized by a membrane pore size
   between 1 and 1000 kDa and operating pressures between 0.01 and 10 bar, and is particularly
20 useful for separating colloids like proteins from small molecules like sugars and salts.
    [00191      The term "diafiltration" is performed with the same membranes as ultrafiltration and
    is a tangential flow filtration. During diafiltration, buffer is introduced into the recycle tank
   while filtrate is removed from the unit operation. In processes where the product is in the
    retentate (for example IgG), diafiltration washes components out of the product pool into the
25  filtrate, thereby exchanging buffers and reducing the concentration of undesirable species.
    [00201      As used herein, the word "about" denotes an approximate range of plus or
    minusl0% from a specified value. For instance, the language "about 20%" encompasses a
    range of 18-22%.
    [00211      The term "mixing" describes an act of causing equal distribution of two or more
30  distinct compounds or substances in a solution or suspension by any form of agitation.
    Complete equal distribution of all ingredients in a solution or suspension is not required as a
    result of "mixing" as the term is used in this application.

   [0022]    In this application, the term "solvent" encompasses any liquid substance capable of
   dissolving or dispersing one or more other substances. A solvent may be inorganic in nature,
   such as water, or it may be an organic liquid, such as ethanol, acetone, methyl acetate, ethyl
   acetate, hexane, petrol ether, etc. As used in the term "solvent detergent treatment," solvent
 5 denotes an organic solvent (e.g., tri-N-butyl phosphate), which is part of the solvent detergent
   mixture used to inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses in solution.
   [0023]    The term "detergent" is used in this application interchangeably with the term
   "surfactant" or "surface acting agent." Surfactants are typically organic compounds that are
   amphiphilic, i.e., containing both hydrophobic groups ("tails") and hydrophilic groups
10 ("heads"), which render surfactants soluble in both organic solvents and water. A surfactant
   can be classified by the presence of formally charged groups in its head. A non-ionic
   surfactant has no charge groups in its head, whereas an ionic surfactant carries a net charge in
   its head. A zwitterionic surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups.
   Some examples of common surfactants include: Anionic (based on sulfate, sulfonate or
15 carboxylate anions): perfluorooctanoate (PFOA or PFO), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS),
   sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), ammonium lauryl sulfate, and other alkyl sulfate salts, sodium
   laureth sulfate (also known as sodium lauryl ether sulfate, or SLES), alkyl benzene sulfonate;
   cationic (based on quaternary ammonium cations): cetyl trimethylammonium bromide
   (CTAB) a.k.a. hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, and other alkyltrimethylammonium
20 salts, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA), benzalkonium
   chloride (BAC), benzethonium chloride (BZT); Long chain fatty acids and their salts:
   including caprylate, caprylic acid, heptanoat, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, nanoic acid,
   decanoic acid, and the like; Zwitterionic (amphoteric): dodecyl betaine; cocamidopropyl
   betaine; coco ampho glycinate; nonionic: alkyl poly(ethylene oxide), alkylphenol
25 poly(ethylene oxide), copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(propylene oxide)
   (commercially known as Poloxamers or Poloxamines), alkyl polyglucosides, including octyl
   glucoside, decyl maltoside, fatty alcohols (e.g., cetyl alcohol and oleyl alcohol), cocamide
   MEA, cocamide DEA, polysorbates (Tween 20, Tween 80, etc.), Triton detergents, and
   dodecyl dimethylamine oxide.
30  [00241    As used herein, the term "Intravenous IgG" or "IVIG" treatment refers generally to a
   therapeutic method of intravenously, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly administering a
    composition of IgG immunoglubulins to a patient for treating a number of conditions such as
    immune deficiencies, inflammatory diseases, and autoimmune diseases. The IgG
    immunoglobulins are typically pooled and prepared from plasma. Whole antibodies or
                                                     7

   fragments can be used. IgG immunoglobulins can be formulated in higher concentrations
   (e.g., greater than 10%) for subcutaneous administration, or formulated for intramuscular
   administration. This is particularly common for specialty IgG preparations which are
   prepared with higher than average titres for specific antigens (e.g., Rho D factor, pertussis
 5 toxin, tetanus toxin, botulism toxin, rabies, etc.). For ease of discussion, such subcutaneously
   or intramuscularly formulated IgG compositions are also included in the term "IVIG" in this
   application.
   [00251     By "therapeutically effective amount or dose" or "sufficient/effective amount or
   dose," it is meant a dose that produces effects for which it is administered. The exact dose
10 will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art
   using known techniques (see, e.g., Lieberman,PharmaceuticalDosage Forms (vols. 1-3,
    1992); Lloyd, The Art, Science and Technology ofPharmaceuticalCompounding (1999);
   Pickar, Dosage Calculations (1999); and Remington: The Science and Practiceof Pharmacy,
   20th Edition, 2003, Gennaro, Ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins; the disclosures of which
15 are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties for all purposes).).
                          DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
    [00261    As routinely practiced in modem medicine, sterilized preparations of concentrated
   immunoglobulins (especially IgGs) are used for treating medical conditions that fall into
20 three main classes: immune deficiencies, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and acute
    infections. One commonly used IgG product, intravenous immunoglobulin or IVIG, is
    formulated for intravenous administration, for example, at a 10% concentration.
    Concentrated immunoglobulins may also be formulated for subcutaneous or intramuscular
    administration, for example at or about a 20% concentration.
25  [0027]    In one aspect, the present invention relates to a new and improved method for
    producing highly purified and highly concentrated immunoglobulin compositions from
    pooled plasma. Compared to the previously used IgG purification and concentration
    methods, the inventors have incorporated ultrafiltration and formulation steps, which result in
    higher IgG concentration without significant IgG loss and maintain low pH in the final
30  formulation. Typically, the products have a protein concentration of at least 18%
    weight/volume (w/v), of which vast majority (typically no less than 95%) is IgG, and a pH in
    the range of pH 3-6, which facilitates inactivation of pathogens such as viruses that may be
    present in the plasma. Due to their high IgG concentration and therefore reduced volume in
     administration, the products of this invention are suitable for subcutaneous and/or

    intramuscular administration. In some embodiments, the IgG products have a viscosity no
    greater than 18 mPascal-second and may therefore be suitable for intravenous administration
    as well. Due to the possibility to combine quality attributes for intravenous products with the
    required high concentration for subcutaneous and intramuscular products, simple dilution can
 5  also enable intravenous administration. A further advantage of the IgG composition of this
    invention is that they possess excellent stability during storage.
    [00281     In certain aspects, the present invention provides methods for preparing a highly
    concentrated IgG preparation with a final protein concentrations of greater than about 17%
    and an IgG purity of at least about 95%. In certain embodiments, the preparation has an
10  extended stability and is formulated for intravenous , subcutaneous, and/or intramuscular
    administration.
     [0029]    In another aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions and
    formulations of IgG compositions prepared according to the improved manufacturing
    methodologies provided herein. In certain embodiments, these compositions and
15  formulations provide improved properties as compared to other IVIG compositions currently
    on the market. For example, in certain embodiments, the compositions and formulations
    provided herein are stable for an extended period of time. In another embodiment,
     compositions and formulations provided herein have a higher IgG concentration as compared
     to other IVIG compositions currently on the market. In yet other embodiments, compositions
20   and formulations provided herein have a higher IgG concentration and are stable for an
     extended period of time.
     [0030]     In yet another aspect, the present invention provides method for treating immune
     deficiencies, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and acute infections comprising the
     administration of an IgG composition prepared using the improved methods provided herein.
25   I.      Producing a Concentrated, Purified IgG Preparation
      [00311    IVIG compositions comprising whole antibodies have been described for the
     treatment of certain autoimmune conditions. (See, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication US
     2002/0114802, US 2003/0099635, and US 2002/0098182.) The IVIG compositions
     disclosed in these references include polyclonal antibodies.
 30   [0032]    Generally, immunoglobulin preparations according to the present invention can be
     prepared from any suitable starting materials, for example, recovered plasma or source
     plasma. In a typical example, blood or plasma is collected from healthy donors. Usually, the
                                                       9

   blood is collected from the same species of animal as the subject to which the
   immunoglobulin preparation will be administered (typically referred to as "homologous"
   immunoglobulins). The immunoglobulins are isolated from the blood by suitable procedures,
   such as, for example, precipitation (alcohol fractionation or polyethylene glycol
 5 fractionation), chromatographic methods (ion exchange chromatography, affinity
   chromatography, immunoaffinity chromatography) ultracentrifugation, and electrophoretic
   preparation, and the like. (See, e.g., Cohn et al., J.Am. Chem. Soc. 68:459-75 (1946); Oncley
   et al., J Am. Chem. Soc. 71:541-50 (1949); Barundern et al., Vox Sang. 7:157-74 (1962);

    [00331     Unlike the methods described above, in one aspect the present invention provides
   methods of preparing concentrated IgG compositions that utilize a cryo-poor starting
   material. Generally, the methods provided herein utilize both modified Cohn-Oncley alcohol
    fractionation steps and ion exchange chromatography to provide superior IgG yields, while
15  maintaining the same, if not improved, quality as found in currently available commercial
    IVIG preparations.
    [0034]      In many cases, immunoglobulin is prepared from gamma globulin-containing
    products produced by the alcohol fractionation and/or ion exchange and affinity
    chromatography methods well known to those skilled in the art. Purified Cohn Fraction II is
20  commonly used. The starting Cohn Fraction II paste is typically at or about 95 percent IgG
    and is comprised of the four IgG subtypes. The different subtypes are present in Fraction II
    in approximately the same ratio as they are found in the pooled human plasma from which
    they are obtained. The Fraction II is further purified before formulation into an administrable
    product. For example, the Fraction II paste can be dissolved in a cold purified aqueous
25   alcohol solution and impurities removed via precipitation and filtration. Following the final
     filtration, the immunoglobulin suspension can be dialyzed or diafiltered (e.g., using
    ultrafiltration membranes having a nominal molecular weight limit of less than or equal to
     100,000 daltons) to remove the alcohol. The solution can be concentrated or diluted to obtain
     the desired protein concentration and can be further purified by techniques well known to
30   those skilled in the art.
     [00351      Preparative steps can be used to enrich a particular isotype or subtype of
     immunoglobulin. For example, protein A, protein G or protein H sepharose chromatography
     can be used to enrich a mixture of immunoglobulins for IgG, or for specific IgG subtypes.

   [0036]     As will be described in detail below, the high concentration IgG products of this
   invention are produced by a process having many of the same or similar steps as in the
 5 process of producing IVIG. The additional steps of ultrafiltration/diafiltration using open
   channel membranes with a specifically designed post-wash and formulation near the end the
   production process render the resulting IgG compositions about twice as high in protein
   concentration (200mg/mL) compared to state of the art IVIGs (e.g., GAMMAGARD*
   LIQUID) without affecting yield and storage stability. With most of the commercial
10 available ultrafiltration membranes a concentration of 200mg/mL IgG cannot be reached
   without major protein losses. These membranes will be blocked early and therefore adequate
   post-wash is difficult to achieve. Therefore open channel membrane configurations have to
   be used. Even with open channel membranes, a specifically designed post-wash procedure
   has to be used to obtain the required concentration without significant protein loss (less than
15 2% loss). Even more surprising is the fact that the higher protein concentration of 200mg/mL
   does not effect the virus inactivation capacity of the low pH storage step. The general
   process of producing the high concentration IgG composition includes the following steps:
   A. Separation of Cryoprecipitates
    [00371    The purification process typically starts with thawing previously frozen pooled
20 plasma, already checked for safety and quality considerations. Thawing is typically carried
   out at a temperature no higher than 6'C. Centrifugation or filtration is then performed in the
   cold to separate solid and liquid upon plasma being thawed, usually at the same low
   temperature as thawing. The liquid portion (also referred to as "cryo-poor plasma," after
   cold-insoluble proteins removed by centrifugation or filtration from fresh thawed plasma) is
25 then processed in the next step. Various additional steps can be taken at this juncture for the
   isolation of factor eight inhibitor bypass activity (FEIBA), Factor IX-complex, Factor VII
    concentrate, or Antithrombin III-complex, which are described in detail in Example 1.
   B. Obtain Supernatant of Fractionation I
                                                                                     0
    [0038]    In this step, cyro-poor plasma is typically cooled to at or about 0 ± 1 C, and its pH
30  is adjusted to at or about 7.0. In certain embodiments, the pH is adjusted to between about
    7.0 and about 7.5, preferably between at or about 7.1 and at or about 7.3, most preferably at
    or about 7.2. In one embodiment, the pH is adjusted to at or about 7.0. In another
    embodiment, the pH is adjusted to at or about 7.1. In another embodiment, the pH is adjusted
                                                    11

   to at or about 7.2. In another embodiment, the pH is adjusted to at or about 7.3. In another
   embodiment, the pH is adjusted to at or about 7.4. In another embodiment, the pH is adjusted
   to at or about 7.5. Pre-cooled ethanol is then added while the plasma is being stirred to a
   target concentration of ethanol at 8% v/v. At the same time the temperature is further
 5 lowered to between about -4 and about 00 C, preferably about -2'C, to precipitate
   contaminants such as a 2-macroglobulin,       1A- and 13-globulin, fibrinogen, and Factor VIII.
   Typically, the precipitation event will include a hold time of at least about 1 hour, although
   shorter or longer hold times may also be employed. Subsequently, the supernatant
   (Supernatant I), ideally containing the entirety of the IgG content present in the cryo-poor
10 plasma, is then collected by centrifugation, filtration, or another suitable method.
   C. Precipitate of Fractionation 11+ III
    [0039]    To further enrich the IgG content and purity of the fractionation, Supernatant I is
   subjected to a second precipitation step. Generally, the pH of the solution is adjusted to a pH
   of between about 6.8 and about 7.2, preferably at or about 7.0. Alcohol, preferably ethanol,
15 is then added to the solution while being stirred to a final concentration of between about
   20% and about 25% (v/v). In one embodiment, the final concentration of alcohol is at or
   about 20%. In another embodiment, the final alcohol concentration is at or about 21%. In
   another embodiment, the final alcohol concentration is at or about 22%. In another
   embodiment, the final alcohol concentration is at or about 23%. In another embodiment, the
20  final alcohol concentration is at or about 24%. In another embodiment, the final alcohol
   concentration is at or about 25%. The liquid portion, also referred to as Fraction 11+11I
    supernatant, can be further processed to extract Factor V. The precipitate from this step is
   processed further in the next step. In one embodiment, steps B and C can also be performed
   together.
25  D. Extraction from Fractionations II and III Precipitate
    [0040]    A cold extraction buffer is used to resuspend the Fraction II+III precipitate at a
    typical ratio of 1 part of precipitate in 15 parts of extraction buffer. An exemplary extraction
    buffer contains 5 mM monobasic sodium phosphate and 5 mM acetate, and has a pH at or
    about 4.5 ± 0.2 and conductivity of at or about 0.7 to 0.9 mS/cm. In one embodiment, the
30  conductivity of the extraction buffer is at or about 0.7 mS/cm. In another embodiment, the
    conductivity of the extraction buffer is at or about 0.8 mS/cm. In yet another embodiment,
    the conductivity of the extraction buffer is at or about 0.9 mS/cm. The extraction process is
    performed at a temperature of at or about 2 to 8*C.
                                                      12

   [0041]     Other suitable re-suspension ratios may be used, for example from about 1:8 to
   about 1:30, or from about 1:10 to about 1:20, or from about 1:12 to about 1:18, or from about
   1:13 to about 1:17, or from about 1:14 to about 1:16. In certain embodiments, the re
   suspension ratio may be at or about 1:8, 1:9, 1:10, 1:11, 1:12, 1:13, 1:14, 1:15, 1:16, 1:17,
 5 1:18, 1:19, 1:20, 1:21, 1:22, 1:23, 1:24, 1:25, 1:26, 1:27, 1:28, 1:29, 1:30, or higher.
   [00421     Suitable solutions for the extraction of the II+II precipitate will generally have a pH
   between about 4.0 and about 5.5. In certain embodiments, the solution will have a pH
   between about 4.0 and about 5.0. In another embodiment, the solution will have a pH
   between about 4.5 and about 5.0. In other embodiments, the extraction solution will have a
10 pH of about 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, or 5.5. In one
   embodiment, the pH of the extraction buffer will be at or about 4.5. In another embodiment,
   the pH of the extraction buffer will be at or about 4.6. In another embodiment, the pH of the
   extraction buffer will be at or about 4.7. In another embodiment, the pH of the extraction
   buffer will be at or about 4.8. In another embodiment, the pH of the extraction buffer will be
15 at or about 4.9. In another embodiment, the pH of the extraction buffer will be at or about
   5.0.
   [0043]     The extraction buffer will preferably have a conductivity of from about 0.5 mS-cm'
   to about 2.0 mS-cm'. For example, in certain embodiments, the conductivity of the
   extraction buffer will be at or about 0.5 mS-cm', or at or about 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2,
20  1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, or about 2.0 mS-cm'. One of ordinary skill in the art will
   know how to generate extraction buffers having an appropriate conductivity.
   E. Fumed Silica Treatment and Filtration
    [00441    In some embodiment, fumed silica (e.g., Aerosil 380 or equivalent) is added to the
    suspension from the last step to a concentration of at or about 40g/kg of suspension, or
                                                                                            0
25  equivalent to 1.8g/liter of cryo-poor plasma. Mixing takes place at about 2 to 8 C for at least
    50 to 70 minutes. In some cases, filter aid (e.g., Hyflo-Supper-Cel from World Minerals,
    used at a concentration of at or about 0.5 kg/kg of suspension) is added to facilitate the
    subsequent step of liquid/solid separation by filtration. The extraction buffer is used for post
    washing of the filter press. The filtration process is maintained at a temperature of about 2 to
30  80C.
    F. Fractionation of Precipitate G
    [00451     Filtrate from the last step is then mixed with polysorbate-80 to a concentration of at
    or about 0.2% w/v with stirring for at least 30 minutes at a temperature of about 2'C to 8'C.
                                                      13

   Sodium citrate dehydrate is then mixed into the solution at or about 8g/ liter for another 30
   minutes of stirring at a temperature of about 20 C to 8'C. The solution's pH is then adjusted
   to at or about 7.0 ± 0.1. In certain embodiments, the pH is adjusted with either sodium
   hydroxide or acetic acid. Cold alcohol is then added to the solution to a concentration of at or
 5 about 25% v/v, and a precipitation step similar to Cohn II is performed.
   G. Suspension of Precipitate G
    [0046]    The precipitate from the last step is dissolved and filtered with a depth filter of a
   nominal pore size of 0.2 Am (e.g., Cuno VR06 filter or equivalent) to obtain a clear filtrate.
   In another embodiment, the precipitate is dissolved and then centrifuged to recover a clarified
10 supernatant.
   H. Solvent and Detergent Treatment
    [0047]    The filtrate from the last step is used for the solvent-/detergent treatment. A typical
    solvent/detergent treatment mixture comprises 1.0% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.3% (v/v) Tween
    80, and 0.3% (v/v) TNBP, and the mixture is typically held at a temperature of about 18'C to
15 25'C for at least 60 minutes. Methods for the detergent treatment of plasma derived fractions
    are well known in the art. Generally, any standard non-ionic detergent treatment may be used
    in conjunction with the methods provided herein.
    I. Cation Exchange Chromatography
    [00481    In order to further purify and concentrate IgG from the S/D treated PptG filtrate,
20  cation exchange and/or anion exchange chromatography can be employed. Methods for
    purifying and concentrating IgG using ion exchange chromatography are well known in the
    art. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,886,154 describes a method in which a Fraction II+II
    precipitate is extracted at low pH (between about 3.8 and 4.5), followed by precipitation of
    IgG using caprylic acid, and finally implementation of two anion exchange chromatography
25  steps. U.S. Patent No. 6,069,236 describes a chromatographic IgG purification scheme that
    does not rely on alcohol precipitation at all. PCT Publication No. WO 2005/073252
    describes an IgG purification method involving the extraction of a Fraction 11+111 precipitate,
    caprylic acid treatment, PEG treatment, and a single anion exchange chromatography step.
    U.S. Patent No. 7,186,410 describes an IgG purification method involving the extraction of
30  either a Fraction I+II+III or a Fraction II precipitate followed by a single anion exchange step
    performed at an alkaline pH. U.S. Patent No. 7,553,938 describes a method involving the
    extraction of either a Fraction I+11+III or a Fraction 11+111 precipitate, caprylate treatment,
    and either one or two anion exchange chromatography steps. U.S. Patent No. 6,093,324
                                                      14

   describes a purification method comprising the use of a macroporous anion exchange resin
   operated at a pH between about 6.0 and about 6.6. U.S. Patent No. 6,835,379 describes a
   purification method that relies on cation exchange chromatography in the absence of alcohol
   fractionation.
 5 [0049]      In one embodiment, the solvent/detergent containing protein solution from the last
   step is then passed through a cation exchange column to remove the solvent and detergent.
   After washing out of SD reagents, the absorbed proteins are then eluted with high pH elution
   buffer. In one embodiment, the elution buffer will have a pH of between about 7.5 and about
   9.5. In another embodiment, the elution buffer will have a pH of between about 8.0 and
10 about 9.0. In a preferred embodiment, the elution buffer will have a pH of at or about 8.5
   0.1.
   J. Anion Exchange Chromatography
    [0050]     The eluate from the last step is adjusted to pH 6 and diluted to the appropriate
   conductivity for the following equilibrated anion exchange column. The column flow
15 through during loading and washing is collected for further processing.
   K. Nanofiltration
    [00511      In order to further reduce the viral load of the IgG composition provided herein, the
    anion exchange column effluent may be nanofiltered using a suitable nanofiltration device.
    In certain embodiments, the nanofiltration device will have a mean pore size of between
20  about 15 nm and about 200 rn. Examples of nanofilters suitable for this use include, without
    limitation, DVD, DV 50, DV 20 (Pall), Viresolve NFP, Viresolve NFR (Millipore), Planova
    15N, 20N, 35N, and 75N (Planova). In a specific embodiment, the nanofilter may have a
    mean pore size of between about 15 nm and about 72 nm, or between about 19 nm and about
    35 nm, or of at or about 15 rm, 19mn, 35nm, or 72 rm. In a preferred embodiment, the
25  nanofilter will have a mean pore size of at or about 35 nm, such as an Asahi PLANOVA 35N
    filter or equivalent thereof.
    L. Ultrafiltration and Diafiltration
     [0052]     Subsequent to nanofiltration, the filtrate is further concentrated to a protein
    concentration of 5 ± 1%w/v by ultrafiltration. In some examples, the ultrafiltration is carried
30  out in a cassette with an open channel screen and the ultrafiltration membrane has a nominal
    molecular weight cut off (NMWCO) of 50 kDa or less.
                                                       is

   [0053]     In one embodiment, the nanofiltrate may be concentrated by ultrafiltration to a
   protein concentration of between about 2% and about 10% (w/v). In certain embodiments,
   the ultrafiltration is carried out in a cassette with an open channel screen and the
   ultrafiltration membrane has a nominal molecular weight cut off (NMWCO) of less than
 5 about 100 kDa or less than about 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, or fewer kDa. In a preferred
   embodiment, the ultrafiltration membrane has a NMWCO of no more than 50 kDa.
   [00541     Upon completion of the ultrafiltration step, the concentrate may further be
   concentrated via diafiltration against a solution suitable for intravenous or intramuscular
   administration. In certain embodiments, the diafiltration solution may comprise a stabilizing
10 and/or buffering agent. In a preferred embodiment, the stabilizing and buffering agent is
   glycine at an appropriate concentration, for example between about 0.20 M and about 0.30M,
   or between about 0.22M and about 0.28M, or between about 0.24M and about 0.26 mM, or at
   a concentration of at or about 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, or 3.0. In a
   preferred embodiment, the diafiltration buffer contains at or about 0.25 M glycine.
15 [0055]     In a preferred embodiment, upon completion of the ultrafiltration step, the
   concentrate is diafiltered against a 0.25 M glycine solution with a low pH. Typically, the
   minimum exchange volume is 6 times of the original concentrate volume, and the solution is
   concentrated to a protein concentration of more than 20% w/v. At the end of the diafiltration
   and concentration process, the pH of the solution is typically between 4.4 to 4.9.
20 [00561     Typically, the minimum exchange volume is at least about 3 times the original
   concentrate volume or at least about 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or more times the original concentrate
   volume. The IgG solution may be concentrated to a final protein concentration of between
   about 5% and about 22% (w/v), or between about 10% and about 22% (w/v), or between
   about 15% and about 22% (w/v), or between about 18% and about 22% (w/v), or between
25 about 20% and about 22%, or to a final concentration of at or about 5%, or 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%,
    10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%,20%,21%,22%, or higher. In a
   preferred embodiment, the IgG solution will be concentrated to final protein concentration of
   at or between about 20% and at or between 22%. Typically, at the end of the concentration
   process, the pH of the solution will be between about 4.6 to 5.1.
30 M. Formulation
    [00571    Upon completion of the diafiltration step, the protein concentration of the solution is
   adjusted to with the diafiltration buffer to a final concentration of between about 5% and
   about 20% (w/v), or between about 10% and about 20% (w/v), or between about 15% and
                                                      16

   about 20% (w/v), or between about 18% and about 20% (w/v), or to a final concentration of
   about 5%, or 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, or
   20%. In a preferred embodiment, the final protein concentration of the solution is at or
   between about 19% and at or about 21%. In a preferred embodiment, upon completion of
 5 diafiltration, the protein concentration of the solution is adjusted to just over 20% w/v, e.g., at
   or about 20.4 ± 04% w/v, with the diafiltration buffer.
   N. Further Sterilization
   [00581     The formulated bulk solution is further sterilized by first filtering through a
   membrane filter with an absolute pore size of 0.2 micron or less. Then the solution is
10 aseptically dispensed into final containers for proper sealing, with samples taken for testing.
   The final step is storing the sealed containers at 30 to 32C for an extended time period, e.g.,
   21 to 22 days.
   II.      Concentrated IgG Compositions
   [0059]     In one aspect, the present invention relates to aqueous IgG compositions prepared
15 by the methods provided herein. Generally, the IgG compositions prepared by the novel
   methods described herein will have high IgG content and purity. For example, IgG
   compositions provided herein may have a protein concentration of at least about 15% (w/v)
   and an IgG content of greater than 90% purity. These high purity IgG compositions are
   suitable for therapeutic administration, e.g., for subcutaneous and/or intramuscular
20 administration. In one embodiment, the IgG compositions provided herein are suitable for
   intravenous administration, for example by diluting prior to administration. In one
   embodiment, the concentration of IgG is at or about 20% and is used for subcutaneous or
   intramuscular administration.
                    [0060] In one embodiment, the present invention provides an aqueous IgG
25 composition prepared by a method comprising the steps of:
                    (1)     separating liquid and precipitate from plasma by centrifugation;
                    (2)     mixing pre-cooled ethanol with the liquid from (1) to form a mixture,
   which has an ethanol concentration of at or about 8% (v/v);
                    (3)     separating liquid and precipitate from the mixture of (2) by
30 centrifugation;
                    (4)     adjusting pH and ethanol concentration of the liquid from (3) to at or
   about 7.0 and 20-25% (v/v), respectively, thereby forming a mixture;
                                                    17

                     (5)    separating liquid and precipitate from the mixture of (4) by
   centrifugation;
                     (6)    resuspending the precipitate of (5) with a buffer at a ratio of about 1 to
   15 in weight to form a suspension;
 5                   (7)    mixing silicon dioxide (SiO2) with the suspension from (6) and
   obtaining a filtrate by filtration;
                     (8)    mixing a detergent and cold alcohol with the filtrate of (7) and
   obtaining a precipitate by centrifugation;

   filter of 0.2 ptm or less, thereby obtaining a composition of concentrated IgG.
   [0061]     In one embodiment, the present invention provides aqueous IgG compositions
   comprising a protein concentration of between about 150 g/L and about 250 g/L. In certain
   embodiments, the protein concentration of the IgG composition is between about 175 g/L and
25 about 225 g/L, or between about 200 g/L and about 225 g/L, or any suitable concentration
   within these ranges, for example at or about, 150 g/L, 155 g/L, 160 g/L, 165 g/L, 170 g/L,
   175 g/L, 180 g/L, 185 g/L, 190 g/L, 195 g/L, 200 g/L, 205 g/L, 210 g/L, 215 g/L, 220 g/L,

   the aqueous IgG composition comprises a protein concentration of at or about 200 g/L. In a
30 particularly preferred embodiment, the aqueous IgG composition comprises a protein
   concentration of at or about 204 g/L.
   [00621     The methods provided herein allow for the preparation of IgG compositions having
   very high levels of purity. For example, in one embodiment, at least about 95% of the total
   protein in a composition provided herein will be IgG. In other embodiments, at least about
                                                       1R

   96% of the protein is IgG, or at least about 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, or more of the total
   protein of the composition will be IgG.
   [0063]    Similarly, the methods provided herein allow for the preparation of IgG
   compositions which containing extremely low levels of contaminating agents. For example,
 5 in certain embodiments, IgG compositions are provided that contain less than about 100 mg/L
   IgA. In other embodiments, the IgG composition will contain less than about 50 mg/L IgA,
   preferably less than about 35 mg/L IgA, most preferably less than about 20 mg/L IgA.
   II.     Pharmaceutical Compositions
   [0064]    In another aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions and
10 formulations comprising purified IgG prepared by the methods provided herein. Generally,
   the IgG pharmaceutical compositions and formulations prepared by the novel methods
   described herein will have high IgG content and purity. For example, IgG pharmaceutical
   compositions and formulations provided herein may have a protein concentration of at least
   about 15% (w/v) and an IgG content of greater than 90% purity. These high purity IgG
15 compositions are suitable for therapeutic administration, e.g., for subcutaneous and/or
   intramuscular administration. In one embodiment, the IgG compositions provided herein are
   suitable for intravenous administration, for example by diluting prior to administration. In
   one embodiment, the concentration of IgG is at or about 20% and is used for subcutaneous or
   intramuscular administration.
20 [0065]    In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are prepared
   by formulating an aqueous IgG composition isolated using a method provided herein.
   Generally, the formulated composition will have been subjected to at least one, preferably at
   least two, most preferably at least three, viral inactivation or removal steps. Non-limiting
   examples of viral inactivation or removal steps that may be employed with the methods
25 provided herein include, solvent detergent treatment (Horowitz et al., Blood Coagul
   Fibrinolysis1994 (5 Suppl 3):S21-S28 and Kreil et al., Transfusion 2003 (43):1023-1028,
   both of which are herein expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety for all
   purposes), nanofiltration (Hamamoto et al., Vox Sang 1989 (56)230-236 and Yuasa et al., J
   Gen Virol. 1991 (72 (pt 8)):2021-2024, both of which are herein expressly incorporated by
30 reference in their entirety for all purposes), and low pH incubation at high temperatures
   (Kempf et al., Transfusion 1991 (31)423-427 and Louie et al., Biologicals 1994 (22):13-19).
   [00661     In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical formulations are provided having an IgG
   content of between about 175 g/L IgG and about 225 g/L IgG. Generally, these IVIG
                                                     19

   formulations are prepared by isolating an IgG composition from plasma using a method
   described herein, concentrating the composition, and formulating the concentrated
   composition in a solution suitable for intravenous administration. The IgG compositions may
   be concentrated using any suitable method known to one of skill in the art. In one
 5 embodiment, the composition is concentrated by ultrafiltration/diafiltration. In some
   embodiments, the ultrafiltration device used to concentrate the composition will employ an
   ultrafiltration membrane having a nominal molecular weight cut off (NMWCO) of less than
   about 100 kDa or less than about 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, or fewer kDa. In a preferred
   embodiment, the ultrafiltration membrane has a NMWCO of no more than 50 kDa. Buffer
10 exchange may be achieved using any suitable technique known to one of skill in the art. In a
   specific embodiment, buffer exchange is achieved by diafiltration.
    [0067]    In a specific embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of IgG is provided,
   wherein the IgG composition was purified from plasma using a method comprising the steps

    or detergent and maintaining the solution for at least 60 minutes;
                     (10)    passing the solution after (9) through a cation exchange
     chromatography column and eluting proteins absorbed on the column in an eluate;

                     (11)   passing the eluate from (10) through an anion exchange
   chromatography column to generate an effluent;
                     (12)   passing the effluent through a nanofilter to generate a nanofiltrate;
                     (13)   passing the nanofiltrate through an ultrafiltration membrane to generate
 5 an ultrafiltrate;
                     (14)   diafiltrating the ultrafiltrate against a diafiltration buffer to generate a
   solution having a protein concentration of about 20% (w/v); and
                     (15)   sterilizing the solution from (14) by filtering the solution through a
   filter of 0.2 ym or less, thereby obtaining a composition of concentrated IgG.
10 [0068]     In one embodiment, the present invention provides pharmaceutical IgG
   compositions comprising a protein concentration of between about 150 g/L and about 250
   g/L. In certain embodiments, the protein concentration of the IgG composition is between
   about 175 g/L and about 225 g/L, or between about 200 g/L and about 225 g/L, or any
   suitable concentration within these ranges, for example at or about, 150 g/L, 155 g/L, 160
15 g/L, 165 g/L, 170 g/L, 175 g/L, 180 g/L, 185 g/L, 190 g/L, 195 g/L, 200 g/L, 205 g/L, 210
   g/L, 215 g/L, 220 g/L, 225 g/L, 230 g/L, 235 g/L, 240 g/L, 245 g/L, 250 g/L, or higher. In a
   preferred embodiment, the aqueous IgG composition comprises a protein concentration of at
   or about 200 g/L. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the aqueous IgG composition
   comprises a protein concentration of at or about 204 g/L.
20 [0069]     The methods provided herein allow for the preparation of IgG pharmaceutical
   compositions having very high levels of purity. For example, in one embodiment, at least
   about 95% of the total protein in a composition provided herein will be IgG. In other
   embodiments, at least about 96% of the protein is IgG, or at least about 97%, 98%, 99%,
   99.5%, or more of the total protein of the composition will be IgG.
25  [00701     Similarly, the methods provided herein allow for the preparation of IgG
   pharmaceutical compositions which containing extremely low levels of contaminating agents.
   For example, in certain embodiments, IgG compositions are provided that contain less than
   about 100 mg/L IgA. In other embodiments, the IgG composition will contain less than
   about 50 mg/L IgA, preferably less than about 35 mg/L IgA, most preferably less than about
30 20 mg/L IgA.
    [0071]     The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein will typically comprise one or
   more buffering agents or pH stabilizing agents suitable for intravenous administration. Non
    limiting examples of buffering agents suitable for formulating an IgG composition provided
                                                       2.1

   herein include glycine, citrate, phosphate, acetate, glutamate, tartrate, benzoate, lactate,
   histidine or other amino acids, gluconate, malate, succinate, formate, propionate, carbonate,
   or any combination thereof adjusted to an appropriate pH. Generally, the buffering agent will
   be sufficient to maintain a suitable pH in the formulation for an extended period of time. In a
 5 preferred embodiment, the buffering agent is glycine.
   [00721    In some embodiments, the concentration of buffering agent in the formulation will
   be between about 100 mM and about 400 mM, preferably between about 150 mM and about
   350 mM, more preferably between about 150 mM and about 300 mM, most preferably
   between about 175 mM and about 225 mM. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the
10 concentrated IgG composition will comprise between about 150 mM and about 250 mM
   glycine, most preferably about 200 mM glycine. In another preferred embodiment, the
   concentrated IgG composition will contain at or about 250 mM glycine.
   [0073]    In certain embodiments, the pH of the formulation will be between about 4.1 and
   about 5.6, preferably between about 4.4 and about 5.3, most preferably between about 4.6 and
15 about 5.1. In particular embodiments, the pH of the formulation may be about 4.1, 4.2, 4.3,
   4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, or 5.6.
    [0074]    In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein may
   optionally further comprise an agent for adjusting the osmolarity of the composition. Non
   limiting examples of osmolarity agents include mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol, sucrose, glucose,
20 dextrose, levulose, fructose, lactose, polyethylene glycols, phosphates, sodium chloride,
   potassium chloride, calcium chloride, calcium gluconoglucoheptonate, dimethyl sulfone, and
   the like.
    [0075]    Typically, the formulations provided herein will have osmolarities that are
   comparable to physiologic osmolarity, about 285 to 295 mOsmol/kg (Lacy et al., Drug
25 InformationHandbook - Lexi-Comp 1999:1254. In certain embodiments, the osmolarity of
   the formulation will be between about 200 mOsmol/kg and about 350 mOsmol/kg, preferably
   between about 240 and about 300 mOsmol/kg. In particular embodiments, the osmolarity of

   [0076]     The IgG formulations provided herein are generally stable in liquid form for an
   extended period of time. In certain embodiments, the formulations are stable for at least
   about 3 months at room temperature, or at least about 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
   16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, or 24 months at room temperature. The formulation will also
 5 generally be stable for at least about 18 months under refrigerated conditions (typically
   between about 2*C and about 8'C), or for at least about 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, or 45
   months under refrigerated conditions.
   IV.      Administration of the IgG Preparation
   [00771     As routinely practiced in the modem medicine, sterilized preparations of
10 concentrated immunoglobulins (especially IgGs) are used for treating medical conditions that
   fall into these three main classes: immune deficiencies, inflammatory and autoimmune
   diseases, and acute infections. These IgG preparations may also be useful for treating
   multiple sclerosis (especially relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis or RRMS), Alzheimer's
   disease, and Parkinson's disease. The purified IgG preparation of this invention is suitable
15 for these purposes, as well as other clinically accepted uses of IgG preparations.
   [00781     The FDA has approved the use of IVIG to treat various indications, including
   allogeneic bone marrow transplant, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, idiopathic
   thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), pediatric HIV, primary immunodeficiencies, Kawasaki
   disease, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), and kidney transplant
20 with a high antibody recipient or with an ABO incompatible donor. In certain embodiments,
   the IVIG compositions provided herein are useful for the treatment or management of these
   diseases and conditions.
   [0079]     Furthermore, off-label uses for IVIG are commonly provided to patients for the
   treatment or management of various indications, for example, chronic fatigue syndrome,
25 clostridium difficile colitis, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, Graves' ophthalmopathy,
   Guillain-Barr6 syndrome, muscular dystrophy, inclusion body myositis, Lambert-Eaton
   syndrome, Lupus erythematosus, multifocal motor neuropathy, multiple sclerosis (MS),
   myasthenia gravis, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, Parvovirus B 19 infection,
   pemphigus, post-transfusion purpura, renal transplant rejection, spontaneous
30 Abortion/Miscarriage, stiff person syndrome, opsoclonus Myoclonus, severe sepsis and septic
   shock in critically ill adults, toxic epidermal necrolysis, chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
   multiple myeloma, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, and hypogammaglobulinemia. In certain

   embodiments, the IVIG compositions provided herein are useful for the treatment or
   management of these diseases and conditions.
   [0080]     Finally, experimental use of IVIG for the treatment or management of diseases
   including primary immune deficiency, RRMS, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease
 5 has been proposed (U.S. Patent Application Publication No. U.S. 2009/0148463, which is
   herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). In certain embodiments, the
   IVIG compositions provided herein are useful for the treatment or management of primary
   immune deficiency, RRMS, Alzheimer's disease, or Parkinson's disease. In certain
   embodiments comprising daily administration, an effective amount to be administered to the
10 subject can be determined by a physician with consideration of individual differences in age,
   weight, disease severity, route of administration (e.g., intravenous v. subcutaneous) and
   response to the therapy. In certain embodiments, an immunoglobulin preparation of this
   invention can be administered to a subject at about 5 mg/kilogram to about 2000 mg/kilogram
   each day. In additional embodiments, the immunoglobulin preparation can be administered
15 in amounts of at least about 10 mg/kilogram, at last 15 mg/kilogram, at least 20 mg/kilogram,
    at least 25 mg/kilogram, at least 30 mg/kilogram, or at least 50 mg/kilogram. In additional
    embodiments, the immunoglobulin preparation can be administered to a subject at doses up to
    about 100 mg/kilogram, to about 150 mg/kilogram, to about 200 mg/kilogram, to about 250
   mg/kilogram, to about 300 mg/kilogram, to about 400 mg/kilogram each day. In other
20  embodiments, the doses of the immunoglobulin preparation can be greater or less. Further,
    the immunoglobulin preparations can be administered in one or more doses per day.
    Clinicians familiar with the diseases treated by IgG preparations can determine the
    appropriate dose for a patient according to criteria known in the art.
    [00811     One commonly used IgG product, intravenous immunoglobulin or IVIG, is
25  formulated for intravenous administration. Because the IgG preparation of this invention has
    achieved an exceptionally high immunoglobulin concentration (20% w/v or higher), which
    significantly reduces the volume for a therapeutically effective dose, the composition of the
    present invention are particularly advantageous for subcutaneous and/or intramuscular
    administration to a patient, even though intravenous administration remains an option for
30  administration.
     [00821    The term "effective amount" refers to an amount of an immunoglobulin, particularly
    IgG, preparation that results in an improvement or remediation of a medical condition being
    treated in the subject (e.g., primary immune deficiency, RRMS, Alzheimer's disease,
    Parkinson's disease, etc.). An effective amount to be administered to the subject can be
                                                    1)4

   determined by a physician with consideration of individual differences in age, weight, disease
   severity, route of administration (e.g., intravenous v. subcutaneous) and response to the
   therapy. In certain embodiments, an immunoglobulin preparation of this invention can be
   administered to a subject at about 5 mg/kilogram to about 2000 mg/kilogram each day. In
 5 additional embodiments, the immunoglobulin preparation can be administered in amounts of
   at least about 10 mg/kilogram, at last 15 mg/kilogram, at least 20 mg/kilogram, at least 25
   mg/kilogram, at least 30 mg/kilogram, or at least 50 mg/kilogram. In additional
   embodiments, the immunoglobulin preparation can be administered to a subject at doses up to
   about 100 mg/kilogram, to about 150 mg/kilogram, to about 200 mg/kilogram, to about 250
10 mg/kilogram, to about 300 mg/kilogram, to about 400 mg/kilogram each day. In other
   embodiments, the doses of the immunoglobulin preparation can be greater or less. Further,
   the immunoglobulin preparations can be administered in one or more doses per day.
   Clinicians familiar with the diseases treated by IgG preparations can determine the
    appropriate dose for a patient according to criteria known in the art.
15  [0083]     In certain embodiments, a concentrated IgG preparation can be administered to a
    subject at dose of about 5 mg/kilogram to about 2000 mg/kilogram per administration. In
    certain embodiments, the dose may be at least about 5 mg/kg, or at least about 10 mg/kg, or
    at least about 20 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 70 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg, 90
    mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 125 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg, 175 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg,
20  350 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg, 450 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, 550 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg, 650 mg/kg, 700
    mg/kg, 750 mg/kg, 800 mg/kg, 850 mg/kg, 900 mg/kg, 950 mg/kg, 1000 mg/kg, 1100 mg/kg,
    1200 mg/kg, 1300 mg/kg, 1400 mg/kg, 1500 mg/kg, 1600 mg/kg, 1700 mg/kg, 1800 mg/kg,,
    1900 mg/kg,, or at least about 2000 mg/kg.
    [0084]     In accordance with the present invention, the time needed to complete a course of
25  the treatment can be determined by a physician and may range from as short as one day to
    more than a month. In certain embodiments, a course of treatment can be from 1 to 6
    months.
     [00851    The dosage and frequency of concentrated IgG treatment will depend upon, among
    other factors. the disease or condition being treated and the severity of the disease or
30  condition in the patient. Generally, for primary immune dysfunction a dose of between about
     100 mg/kg and about 400 mg/kg body weight will be administered about every 3 to 4 weeks.
    For neurological and autoimmune diseases, up to 2 g/kg body weight is implemented for
    three to six months over a five day course once a month. This is generally supplemented with
    maintenance therapy comprising the administration of between about 100 mg/kg and about
                                                    1)5

   400 mg/kg body weight about once every 3 to 4 weeks. Generally, a patient will receive a
   dose or treatment about once every 14 to 35days, or about every 21 to 28 days. The
   frequency of treatment will depend upon, among other factors. the disease or condition being
   treated and the severity of the disease or condition in the patient.
 5 [0086]      In a preferred embodiment, a method of treating an immunodeficiency, autoimmune
   disease, or acute infection in a human in need thereof is provided, the method comprising
   administering a pharmaceutical IgG composition of the present invention.
                                                EXAMPLES
    [0087]     The following examples are provided by way of illustration only and not by way of
10 limitation. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of non-critical parameters
   that could be changed or modified to yield essentially the same or similar results.
   Example 1: Stability Study of various IgG Concentrations and Formulations
    1.    Purpose
    [00881     The purpose of this study is to compare the storage stability of the low pH (0.25M
15 glycine pH 4.4 - 4.9 as measured in concentrated solution) at higher protein concentration
   with the neutral pH formulation (22.5g/l glycine, 3g/l NaCl pH 7) as currently used for
    intramuscularly and subcutaneously injectable immunglobulins.
    2.     Experimental Design
    [00891      All runs start with the concentration of the nanofiltrate to 5% protein. A ten times
20  buffer exchange against 0. 15M glycine (lowest glycine concentration investigated) is
    performed followed by the final concentration to a target value above 20% protein. While for
    the first set of experiments a 0.5 m2 polyethersulfone Millipore membrane with molecular
                                                                                                     2
    cut-off of 30K (regular screen) is used, the second set of experiments is done with a 0.5 m
    polyethersulfone Millipore membrane with open screen, which is more suitable for solutions
25  with higher viscosity and the post-wash fractions are concentrated by a second ultra- /
    diafiltration device with a lower membrane surface (0.1     in
                                                                   2
                                                                     , open screen) in order to reduce
    yield losses.
     [0090]     The final containers are either formulated and stored at low pH or the low pH
    storage is done in bulk and afterwards they are formulated at neutral pH prior to storage.

   [0091]       pH: pH was tested with Knick Portamess type 911 XPH equipped with a Mettler
   Toledo LoT405-DPA-SC-S8/120 electrode and a PT 1000 temperature probe.
 5 [0092]       Protein: Protein values were determined using Biuret.
   [0093]       Molecular size distribution was tested by using high performance size exclusion
   chromatography.
   [0094]       ACA titer was tested as described in the European Pharmacopoeia.
   4.      Acceptance Criteria
10 [0095]       The following acceptance criteria are defined:
                -      Molecular size distribution by HPLC:
                                i.      Monomers and Oligo-/ Dimers: > 90%

   [00971    The data clearly show that the low pH formulation has lower aggregates and lower
   ACA-titer after 3 months storage at 28 to 301C. All ACA titers of the pH 7 formulations are

   [0098]     The results at 2 to 8'C confirm the trend seen at 28 to 30'C. The ACA titers are all
   below the limit defined as acceptance criteria although the pH 7.0 formulations seem to have
10 higher values. The protein value does not influence the results of the parameters tested.

   [0101]    The values obtained at 2 to 8'C confirmed the results obtained at 28 to 30'C. The

   [01021    As the approach with two systems, one for the main concentration process and the
   other for the concentration of the post-wash, results in higher yield, this method was judged
   to be more appropriate for large scale manufacturing.
   6.        Conclusion
10 [01031    The following conclusions can be drawn from the results presented in this study:
        "  The low pH formulation gives lower ACA values, lower aggregate and lower
           fragment contents after 3 months storage at 2 to 8 0 C and 28 to 30'C.
        "  After 3 months storage at 28 to 30'C the ACA values of the neutral pH formulations
           are above the acceptance criteria.
15      *  The protein value does not influence the results of the parameters tested.
        *  The concentration method does not influence the stability of the product.
        *  Adequate post-wash can only be obtained with open-screen membranes
   [01041    Based on these conclusions it was decided to produce the new IgG product for
   subcutaneous administration with the low pH formulation, the concentration method using a
20 second smaller device for concentrating the post-wash, an ultra-/diafiltration device with
   open screen membranes and at a protein content of 20% z 2%.
   Example 2: Ultrafiltration and Formulation of SUB 0 NG
   1.         Background
    [01051    This information was gathered during production of scale-up and pre-clinical 20%
25 lots. The process used for manufacturing of 20% lots until the nanofiltrate step was as
   described above. Ultra-/diafiltration was improved to concentrate the solution to 20% (limits:
    18 to 22%). In order to reduce yield loss to a minimum, the post-wash of the ultrafiltration
                                                    79

    device used for diafiltration is concentrated by a second smaller device equipped with the
    same membranes and afterwards added to the bulk solution.
    [0106]      Surprisingly it could be shown that the virus inactivation during low pH storage is
    not influenced by the protein concentration of the solution. Similar virus reduction was
 5  achieved in 10% solution (GAMMAGARD* LIQUID) and in 20 % solution. Therefore low
    pH storage as a virus reduction step was maintained for the 20 % product.
    2.          Process Narrative
    ULTRAFILTRATION
    [01071      The glycine concentration of the nanofiltrate is adjusted to a target of 0.25M. The
10  solution is concentrated to a protein concentration of 6 ± 2 % w/v through ultrafiltration (UF).
    Typically, protein concentration is determined by measurement of AU 280 -320 . An extinction
    coefficient of 14.1 is used. The pH is adjusted to 5.2 ± 0.2. The UF membrane used has a
    Nominal Molecular Weight Cut Off (NMWCO) of 50,000 daltons or less and is especially
    designed for high viscosity products (e.g., V screen from Millipore). For example, Millipore
15  Pellicon Biomax with a NMWCO of 50K daltons or less. Membrane material is
    polyethersulphone.
     [01081     The concentrate is diafiltered against a 0.25M glycine solution, pH 4.2 ± 0.2. The
     minimum exchange volume is 1OX of original concentrate volumes. Throughout the
     ultrafiltration/diafiltration operation, the solution is maintained at 4'C to 20'C.
20   [01091     After diafiltration, the solution is concentrated to a protein concentration of
     minimum 22% w/v. The solution temperature is adjusted to 2'C to 8*C. The protein
     concentration may be determined by UV reading through the use of an extinction coefficient
     value of 14.1
     [01101     In order to recover the complete residual protein in the system, the post-wash of the
25   first bigger ultrafiltration system is done with at least 2 times the dead volume in re
     circulation mode to assure that all protein is washed out. Then the post-wash of the first
     ultrafiltration system is concentrated to a protein concentration of at least 22% w/v with a
     second ultra-/ diafiltration system equipped with the same type of membrane which is
     dimensioned a tenth or less of the first one. The post-wash concentrate is added to the bulk
 30   solution. The second ultrafiltration system is then post-washed. This post-wash is used for
      adjustment of the protein concentration of the final bulk in step 14. The solution temperature
      is adjusted to 2'C to 8'C.
                                                        inh

   FORMULATION
   [01111      The protein concentration is further adjusted to 20.4 ± 0.4% w/v with post-wash of
   the second smaller ultrafiltration system and/or with diafiltration buffer. The pH is adjusted
   to 4.4 to 4.9, if necessary.

   1.    INTRODUCTION
   [0112]      This report describes the pre-clinical production and summarizes the results of
   Baxter's new investigational Immunoglobulin preparation "SUBQ NG, 20%," which is a 20%
   (w/v) liquid polyvalent human Inmunoglobulin preparation for subcutaneous use.
10 [0113]      The manufacturing was done as described in "Detailed Description of the Invention"
   with the concentration method as described above. Fractionation starts with the separation of
   cryo-precipitate. The cryo-poor plasma may then be used for isolation of various crude
   coagulation factors and inhibitors prior to subsequent cold alcohol fractionation. Seven
   pathways are chosen for batch adsorption of crude coagulation factors and inhibitors from the
15 cryo-poor plasma prior to SUBQ NG, 20% purification and are referred to as pathways 1 to 7
   in the following table.

    [0114]     For pre-clinical SUBQ NG, 20% production Cohn starting materials derived from
20 the pathways 1, 3 and 6 were chosen to cover a broad variety of different adsorption options.
   Various adsorption processes are described in Teschner et al., 2007, Vox Sang. 92:42-55;
   Polsler et al., 2008, Vox Sang. 94:184-192; U.S. Patent Nos. 6,395,880 and 5,409,990; and
   Prothrombincomplex: Brummelhuis in Methods of Plasma Protein Fractionation(J.M.
    Curling Editor, Academic Press, 1980).

   [01151     The modified Cohn alcohol fractionation leads to a principal intermediate IgG
   fraction, referred to as Precipitate G, which is further processed to the final product using
   chromatographic purification. The downstream manufacturing comprises cation exchange
   (CM-Sepharose fast flow) and anion exchange chromatography (ANX-Sepharose fast flow)
 5 and includes three independent virus inactivation or removal steps, namely
            -    Solvent/detergent treatment (mixture of 1 %Triton X-100, 0.3 %Tri-N-butyl
                 phosphate and 0.3 % Polysorbate-80),
            -    Nanofiltration (Asahi Planova 35 nm) and
            -    Low pH storage for 3 weeks at elevated temperature.
10
    [0116]     In order to reach a higher protein concentration for subcutaneous application an
   open channel screen has to be used at the ultra-/diafiltration step. Preferably a second ultra
   /diafiltration device is used for the concentration of the post-wash fraction in order to recover
   all protein from the first device.
15  [01171     SUBQ NG, 20% is a liquid formulation of Immunoglobulin G (IgG), of which at
   least 95% of the protein is gamma globulin. The product is isotonic and formulated at low
   pH. At a concentration of 10% protein during the final concentration step the pH is 4.4 to
   4.9. The final pH of the 20% solution will be determined after the results of extended
   stability studies are available. The final solution contains 180 to 220 g protein and as the

   [0118]      At the final bulk level the purity of the preparation is illustrated by the low levels of
   the main impurities, which are well below 0.1% of the total IgG. The molecular size
 5 distribution in the 20% product at this final stage of the process is similar to the one of a
   GAMMAGARD* LIQUID / KIOVIG final container. This indicates that the concentration
   to 20% protein has no negative impact on the integrity of the IgG molecule.
   3.     Additional results from the characterization of the pre-clinical batches
   [0119]      The preliminary final container release criteria were defined on the basis of the
10 requirements from the authorities for subcutaneous human immunoglobulins, the final
   container specifications of the current product for subcutaneous administration and the
   GAMMAGARD* LIQUID / KIOVIG specifications. Additional Quality Control tests were
   performed to evaluate the level of product and/or process related impurities.
   [0120]       Furthermore the characterization of the relevant Antibody Spectrum of the Final
15 Containers was done and compared to the results from the pre-clinical IVIG, 10% TVR lots.

    [0124]       Three final container lots of SUBQ NG 20% were successfully manufactured in the
    200 liter scale. Three adsorption pathways were chosen to cover a broad variety of
    adsorption steps prior to alcohol fractionation, namely:
    -            Option 1, US source plasma without adsorption steps
10  -            Option 3, US source plasma after FEIBA, AT-III adsorption
    -            Option 6, US source plasma after F-IX, F-VII, AT-III adsorption

   [01251    In process parameters monitored during the pre-clinical production and the
   characterization of intermediates and the final product showed that there are no obvious
   differences detectable between the three lots.
   [01261    All final containers meet the product related preliminary specifications regardless
 5 which kind of starting material was chosen.
   Example 4: Storage Study of 20% Preparation
   1.        Introduction
   [01271     SUBQ NG, 20% is a 20% (w/v) liquid polyvalent human Immunoglobulin
   preparation for subcutaneous use. The SUBQ NG, 20% was produced as described above.
10 [0128]     This study summarizes the storage data of 3 preclinical lots and one feasibility lot at
   2 to 8*C and 28 to 30*C (feasibility lot only) for up to 6 months.
   2.         Purpose
    [01291    The purpose of this study is to evaluate the storage stability of Sub Q NG 20% final
   containers at 2 to 8'C and 28 to 30*C.
15 3.         Stability Indicating Parameters
    [0130]    The primary degradation modes are denaturation, aggregation and fragmentation,
   resulting in a change in the molecular size distribution of the sample. Therefore the
   molecular size distribution analysis by High Performance Size Exclusion Chromatography is
   the main stability indicating parameter.
20  4.        Batches Examined and Primary Packaging
    [01311    The stability data presented in this report are made with the pre-clinical lots
    SCO0107NG, SCO0207NG and SCO0307NG as well as with the feasibility lot IgGSC 62/1.
    5.        Results
    [0132]    In the following Table 11 the results of the pre-clinical final containers after storage
25  up to 12 months are shown.

   Example 5: Low pH Treatment for Viral Inactivation
   PURPOSE AND RATIONALE
   Introduction
    [01341     Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 14% - 20%, Triple Virally Reduced
10 (TVR) Solution, in the following called Subcuvia NG Solution, is manufactured from pooled
   human plasma. After mass capture steps to remove coagulation factors/inhibitors,
   purification of Subcuvia NG starts with a modified Cohn alcohol fractionation, leading to a
   principal intermediate precipitate G, followed by a downstream process which contains
   chromatographic purification as well as three distinct virus inactivation / removal steps. In
                                                     317

   the current study, the virus reduction capacity of the low pH storage of the final container
   was investigated in detail.
   [01351     The downstream purification process comprises the following steps: resuspended
   Precipitate G is subjected to Solvent/Detergent (S/D) treatment, cation exchange
 5 chromatography using Carboxymethyl(CM)-Sepharose fast flow and anion exchange
   chromatography using ANX-Sepharose@ fast flow, nanofiltration, ultra-diafiltration, pH
   adjustment, and sterile filtration and filling. After aseptic filling the Subcuvia NG Solution is
   subjected to low pH storage in the final container (for schematic illustration of the
   manufacturing process, see process scheme below).
10 Process Scheme
   [0136]     Process scheme A, shown in figure 2, provides an overview of the downstream part
   of the manufacturing scheme for Subcuvia NG Solution starting with Step 10. The custom
   made intermediate used in the current study is equal to the process step "Final container, Pre
   storage."
15 [0137]     Process scheme B, shown in Figure 2, provides an overview of the downscaled
   process used in the present study including sample drawing for virus titration.
   Purpose
    [0138]    To provide a high safety margin with respect to a potential virus transmission, three
   dedicated virus inactivation/removal steps, which complement each other in their mode of
20 action, are integrated into the manufacturing process of Subcuvia NG Solution:
                * Solvent/Detergent treatment (step 11)
                " Nanofiltration (step 14)
                " Low pH Storage at elevated temperature in the final container (post-aseptic
                    filling)
25  [01391    The capacity and robustness of the storage at low pH and elevated temperature with
   respect to inactivation of viruses was already investigated in the course of a previous study, in
   which IGIV1O% TVR, a product equivalent to Subcuvia NG but adjusted to 10% protein for
   i.v. application, was used. The results obtained from this study demonstrated that all lipid
   enveloped viruses investigated were effectively and robustly inactivated, with Bovine viral
30 diarrhea virus (BVDV) showing the slowest inactivation kinetics. Moreover, it could be
   demonstrated that this process step further contributes to the viral safety of the manufacturing

   process with regard to small non lipid-enveloped DNA viruses. Subcuvia NG and IGIV10%
   TVR are immunoglobulin products, where Subcuvia NG is the variation for subcutaneous
   administration, and IGIV10% TVR is the product variation for i.v. application. Both share
   the same manufacturing process up to the ultrafiltration/diafiltration and formulation steps,
 5 where the only difference is that the protein concentration of Subcuvia NG is adjusted to a
   range of 14% to 20% instead of 10%.
    [01401    Therefore the capacity and robustness of the storage step at low pH and elevated
   temperature in the manufacture of Subcuvia NG (see, The European Agency for the
   Evaluation of Medicinal Products Evaluation of Medicines for Human Use (2001): CPMP
10 Biotechnology Working Party - Note for Guidance on Plasma-Derived Medicinal Products,
   CPMP/BWP/269/95 (rev. 3)) with respect to inactivation of BVDV and MMV was evaluated
   by setting selected critical process parameters to the upper and lower limits specified for the
   manufacturing process (i.e., time, temperature: lower limit; pH: upper limit). In addition, to
    further investigate the robustness of this virus inactivation step, the temperature was reduced
15  for a given time period during the downscaled runs.
    [0141]    As discussed above, the following enveloped and non-enveloped viruses were used.
         *  Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) as a model for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and for
            other small lipid-enveloped RNA viruses.
         " Mice Minute Virus (MMV) as a model for Human Parvovirus B19 (B19V) and for
20          other small non-enveloped DNA viruses.
    [01421    In accordance with the CPMP guideline 268/95 (The European Agency for the
    Evaluation of Medicinal Products Human Medicines Evaluation Unit (1996): CPMP
    Biotechnology Working Party - Note for Guidance on Virus Validation Studies: The Design,
    Contribution and Interpretation of Studies Validating the Inactivation and Removal of
25  Viruses, CPMP/BWP/268/95 (revised)) the study was conducted with a downscaled model of
    the respective manufacturing step. The validity of the results obtained with the scaled-down
    manufacturing step "Storage at low pH and elevated temperature" with regard to virus
    inactivation in the manufacture of Subcuvia NG Solution, was demonstrated by comparison
     of parameters specified for this manufacturing step in the large-scale production process and
30  process parameters of the downscaled model. Additionally, selected biochemical parameters
    were monitored and compared to the respective parameters of the large-scale process.

   Viruses and Cells
   [0143]    BVDV, strain NADL (biologically cloned, ATCC VR-1422), obtained from the
   American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, Maryland) is used. The virus is
   propagated on MDBK cells (ATCC CCL-22), according to standard operating procedures,
 5 and titrated on BT cells (ATCC CRL-1390).
   [0144]     MMV, prototype strain (ATCC VR-1346), was obtained from the American Type
   Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland. The virus was propagated according to standard
   operating procedures and titrated on A9 cells (ATCC CCL-1.4).
   Test item
10 [01451     The following lots of custom-made Subcuvia NG intermediate, before "Storage at
   low pH and elevated temperature", i.e., after manufacturing step aseptic filling, were obtained

   Solutions forpH Measurement
   [0150]    pH was measured both directly and in a diluted solution according to the European
   Pharmacopoeia (EP). For measuring pH according to the EP method, the protein
   concentration was diluted to 1%using a 0.9% NaCl solution.
 5 [0151]    The 0.9% NaCl solution was prepared as follows: 9.0 ± 0.9 g NaCl were dissolved
   in 1000 ml aqua dest. The solution was 0.2 tm filtered, stored at room temperature and used
   within 12 months.
   Cell culture media
   [0152]     Media used for cell culture or virus titration were prepared according to standard
10 operating procedures for BVDV and MMV viral titration.
   Virus Titration Assays
   TCIDso Assay
   [0153]     Samples containing viruses were titrated by TCID50 assays according to standard
   operating procedures. Briefly, serial 2 log dilutions of the samples were prepared in the
15 respective tissue culture medium, and 100 gl of each dilution were added to each of 8 wells
   of a microtiter plate seeded with the respective indicator cell line. The microtiter plates are
   stored in humidified and C0 2 -regulated storage units at a temperature of 36'C + 2'C.
   Evaluation of cytopathic effects is accomplished by visual inspection of the cells under a
   microscope after 7 days of storage.
20  [0154]    Median tissue culture infectious doses (TCID5 o) were calculated according to the
   Poisson distribution and expressed as logio[TCID 5o/mli].
   BVDVBulk Titration
    [01551    Studies were performed on MMV-spiked samples. In order to lower the limit of
    detection for the BVDV spiked samples taken from the Subcuvia NG intermediate after 20
25  and 27 days of low pH storage, these samples were titrated as follows: in addition to the
    standard TCID5 Oassay, samples of the 1:3.16 dilution (0.5 logs) and following two 2 log
    dilutions (the respective cell culture medium is used for dilution) are added to all wells (100
    pl per well) of 96-well microtiter plates seeded with the respective indicator cell line.
    Storage of cells and evaluation of the cytopathic effect of the respective virus are done as
30  described above (TCIDso Assay). The results were calculated as follows: The ratio R Vol of
    the volume titrated in the bulk titration and the volume titrated in the regular TCID 50 assay
                                                     41

   was calculated. The logio of R Vol is subtracted from the virus titer determined in the TCID5 o
   assay, and the result is given as the virus titer determined by bulk titration.
           Example:
             -    A sample is assayed (TCIDso assay) on a microtiterplate in serial 0.5 log
 5                dilutions (all 12 columns) and the wells arefound negativefrom the dilution 0
                  (i.e. undiluted) onwards. Calculationaccordingto the Poisson distribution
                  gives a virus titer of <0.11 logo[TCIDso/ml]. The correspondingtotal volume
                  of the sample assayed is 1.17 ml.
             -    The same sample (dilution 0) is appliedonto all wells of a microtiterplate (bulk
10                titration). Therefore, the total sample volume applied is 9.6 ml
             -     The ratio of volumes is: Rrol = 9.6: 1.17 = 8.21; logio (Rvo) = 0.91.
             -     The calculated virus titer is then < 0.11 - 0.91; i.e. < - 0.80. The upper limit of
                   the virus titer's confidence interval is calculatedidentically.
   Calculation of virus titer when no infectivity is scored in successive kinetic samples
15 [0156]    Where no viral infectivity was detected in successive kinetic samples up until the
   final sample after completion of low pH storage, the volume of all successive negative
   samples used for wells in the TCID50 assay with a clear negative result ass taken into account
   for calculation of the assay detection limit. For this the following formula was used (see also
   Appendix 1):
               Virus titer based on n negative successive kinetic                (n
20                                                                    =<--logio       l/lOxi
                           samples, [logo (TGCID50 /ml)]                    lo   1
   with
           Xi (i = 1, 2, 3, .... n) individual virus titers [logio(TCID 5o/ml)] of n successive negative
   samples
    [0157]    If all negative samples have the same titer, i.e. x, the formula simplifies to:
                    Virus titer based on n negative successive kinetic
25                             samples, [logo (TGCD50 /Ml)]                  < x-og1 0 (n)
    Cytotoxicity
    [01581    The cytotoxicity of process intermediates for the virus indicator cell lines used was
   determined from mock-spiked Subcuvia NG intermediate, i.e. spiked with BT-medium for
   infected cells (5% Horse serum)* instead of virus stock as well as from mock-spiked, pH
30  adjusted (pH 4.9± 0.1) and 0.45 gm filtrated starting material on each cell line for
    determination of cytotoxicity. Samples were assayed like virus-containing samples, i.e. they
                                                       A?

   were serially diluted and Stored with the indicator cell line. After storage, the highest non
   cytotoxic concentration was determined. With regard to variations in these biological
   systems, deviations of      0.5 log steps were considered non-significant when comparing
   cytotoxicity in virus spiked and mock-spiked samples.
 5          *      The composition of the BT-medium for infected cells is as follows: DMEM
                   (containing 4.5 g/l D-Glucose) + 1%(v/v) L-Glutamine (200 mM) + 1% (v/v)
                   Gentamicin Sulphate (10 mg/ml) + 1%(v/v) Sodium Pyruvate + 2% (v/v)
                   Sodium Bicarbonate (7.5%) + 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids + 5% (v/v)
                   Horse serum.
10 Interference
   [0159]     For samples with low virus titers, the influence of the sample matrix on the
   performance of the infectivity assay needs to be assessed. For samples containing high virus
   titers, the relevant part of the dilution series, i.e. the part where virus-positive and virus
   negative wells can be scored, occurs at high sample dilutions. Consequently, the influence of
15 the sample matrix, which is also diluted several logo steps, on the detection of virus
   infectivity can be neglected. The interference with determinations of low viral titers for
   samples containing Subcuvia NG intermediate was measured as follows: Samples were
   drawn from the mock-spiked, pH adjusted (pH 4.9± 0.1) and 0.45gm filtrated starting
   material (Subcuvia NG intermediate), diluted 1:3.16 with the appropriate tissue culture
20 medium and spiked 1:100 with pre-diluted (in appropriate tissue culture medium, i.e. BT
   medium for BT cells/BVDV and A9 medium for A9 cells/MMV) virus stock suspension to a
   nominal titer of 2 or 3 logio[TCID 5 o/ml] and titrated as described above. The titers obtained
   for spiked process intermediates were compared to those of spiked cell culture medium
   controls.
25 Calculation of Virus Reduction Factors
    [0160]     The analysis of the virus inactivation capacity of the process was carried out
   according to CPMP guideline 268/95 [3], using the following formula:
                                              R = log
                                                     -gV 21)2xT2 )
   where,
30           R = virus reduction factor
             V1 = volume of starting material

            Ti = concentration of virus in starting material [TCID 5 o/ml]
            V2 = volume of material after the step
            T2 = concentration of virus after the step [TCID5 o/ml]
   [0161]     The volumes and the titers of each spiked sample before and after treatment were
 5 used to calculate R. Whenever virus was undetectable, the detection limit was taken as the
   virus titer for calculation. According to standard operating procedures, calculations were
   carried out with virus titers (logio[TCID 5 o/ml) given to two decimal places; reduction factors
   were rounded to the first decimal place.
   Determination of Validation Parameters
10 Time, Temperature [ 0 C]
   [0162]     Storage time was measured with timers; the temperature was measured with Pt-100
   sensors and recorded continuously.
   pH-Value
   [0163]     The pH value was determined according to standard operating procedures with a
15 standard laboratory pH meter by direct measurement as well as implementing the method
   specified by the European Pharmacopoeia (EP), i.e. after dilution to 1% protein with 0.9%
   NaCl solution. In the following, pH with suffix (EP) means pH measurement according to
   EP method, whereas "pH" without suffix means direct measurement.
   Determination of Other Parameters
20 Molecular size distribution(MSD)
    [0164]    HPLC-SEC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography - Size Exclusion
   Chromatography) analysis of molecular size distribution was done by the department
   Analytical Biochemistry, Baxter, Vienna, Austria, according to standard operating
   procedures. The HPLC-SEC analysis of all samples of the "scale-up" lots (produced in the
25 department PPDProduct Support, Baxter, Vienna, Austria) were performed according to this
   test. Thus, to assure comparability between the test results of the samples of the mock-spiked
   runs (accumulated in the downscaled process in the course of this study) and the test results
   of the "scale-up" lots, the analysis of MSD of the samples of the mock-spiked runs were done
    according to the same test in the same department.
30  Cellulose Acetate Electrophoresis
                                                     44

   [01651    Cellulose Acetate Electrophoresis (CAE) was performed according to standard
   operating procedures by the department ACV Chemistry, Baxter, Vienna, Austria.
   Rounding
   [0166]    Rounding was performed according to standard practices:
 5     *   Assay results were rounded to the same number of decimal places as specified for the
           respective parameter in the manufacturing process, or as determined by the accuracy

   STUDY DESIGN
    [0167]   In order to investigate the robustness of manufacturing step "Storage at low pH and
25 elevated temperature" of Subcuvia NG with respect to virus inactivation, key parameters for
   the efficacy of virus inactivation were defined as discussed below. Runs were performed
   under conditions suitable to investigate the robustness of virus inactivation by low pH

   storage. A comparison of the conditions for the large-scale process and the downscaled runs
   is given in Table A.
        * Protein concentration: As Subcuvia NG is a developmental product, the protein
           concentration range for the formulated bulk is currently rather broadly defined, i.e.
 5         approximately 14% to 20%, and might be narrowed down later on. Thus, to
           investigate the robustness of the low pH treatment, two runs (run designs) were
           performed at the two extremes of possible protein concentrations. Run design 1 was
           performed at 13.5% protein concentration; Run design 2 was performed at 20.9%
           protein concentration.
10         The protein concentration of the custom-made material was provided by the
           department PPD Product Support. The protein concentration of the custom-made
           material was not determined again, as data were already available from analyses,
           performed after production of the custom-made Subcuvia NG intermediate. Since the
           material, which was used for the down-scaled process, was sterile filtered and stored
15         at 2'C to 8'C until the start of the down-scaled process (i.e., not subjected to any
           freeze/thaw procedure), no change in the protein concentration is anticipated for the
           finally formulated and sterile filtered intermediate.
        " pH-Value: In production, a pH range of 4.4 - 4.9 (direct measurement) is specified
           for the Subcuvia NG final container throughout the low pH storage. To investigate
20         the efficacy and robustness of the low pH treatment under conditions less favorable
           for virus inactivation both runs were performed at the higher limit specified, i.e., a pH
           of 4.9 ± 0.1. The pH was measured after spiking and adjusted to the higher limit, if
           necessary. After the low pH storage for 27 days ± 5 hours, the pH was measured
           again by direct pH-measurement and by the method recommended by the European
25         Pharmacopoeia, i.e., dilution to 1%protein with 0.9% NaCl solution.
        "   Temperature: In the production process the temperature during low pH storage is set
           to 30-32 *C. To investigate the robustness of the low pH storage under conditions
           less favorable for virus inactivation, all downscaled runs were performed at the lower
           limit of the temperature range, i.e., at 30   1FC. To examine the potential impact of
30         temperature fluctuations, the temperature was reduced to 25 ± 10C for .26 hours once
            every week (i.e., decrease in temperature was started during day 0, 7, 14, 20 and day
           27 of storage; numbering of days refers to calendar days, i.e. day 0 is the day on
           which the storage is started). Erroneously, the decrease in temperature to 25 ± VC
                                                    A 6,

           for 6 hours was performed twice per week in the first and in the second week of
           storage, i.e., during day 0 and 4 of storage in the first week and during day 7 and 10 of
           storage in the second week of the low pH treatment.
       .    Time: The storage time is typically in the range of 21 days (required for effective
 5         inactivation of BVDV) to 28 days (upper limit for technical/logistical reasons). To
           investigate the efficacy and robustness of the low pH treatment under conditions less
            favorable for virus inactivation all downscaled runs were performed below the limits
            of the above listed storage time range; i.e. for 20 days ± 4 hours for the short option
            and storage for 27 days ± 5 hours for the longer option. The spiked intermediate was
10          stored at low pH and elevated temperature for 27 days ± 5 hours, but samples for
            virus titration were drawn after 20 days ± 4 hours of storage, in order to investigate
            virus clearance after 3 weeks of storage (see also Table A).
   [0168]     Overall, a total of 4 virus-spiked runs (2 with BVDV, and 2 with MMV) were
   performed to investigate the robustness of the virus inactivation capacity of manufacturing
15 step "Storage at low pH and elevated temperature." Furthermore, two unspiked control runs
   were performed to generate samples for determination of biochemical parameters. In
   addition, two mock-spiked control runs were performed and samples taken from these runs
   were used to investigate potential effects (i.e., cytotoxicity and interference) of process
   intermediates on the virus titration assay.
20 [0169]     To further demonstrate the equivalence of the downscale and the large scale
   processes, the following biochemical analyses were performed on the final product before
   and after low pH storage: molecular size distribution and cellulose acetate electrophoresis.

       Thus, the two down-scaled runs were performed at the two extremes of possible protein
       concentration.
   2   The storage period is not narrower defined yet, as dependent on the outcome of the virus clearance

   3   Both runs were performed for 27 d ± 5 h and samples for virus titration were taken on day 20 of
       storage so that virus inactivation data were also available for the large scale process option of 21 to
       22 days of storage.
   4   The temperature was reduced to 25 ±1 C for - 6 hours once every week (i.e. decrease in
10     temperature was started during day 0, 7, 14, 20 and day 27; numbering of days refers to calendar
       days, i.e. day 0 is the day on which the storage is started) of storage. As discussed in Section 4.1.1
       ("Temperatureprofile"), the decrease in temperature to 25 14C for 6 hours was erroneously
       performed twice per week in the first and in the second week of storage (see also DR1_0407).
   5 Method according to the European Pharmacopoeia.
15 Experimental Procedure
   [0170]      Due to its complexity, the sequence of virus spike, pH adjustments and 0.45 mm
   filtration steps is illustrated in the flow chart found in Figure 3 (thickness of arrows indicates
   relative volumes).
   StartingMaterial
20 [0171]      For Run 1 custom-made material (Lot number IGSC64) with a protein concentration
   of 13.5% was taken. This material was used to perform runs at the lower limit of the possible
   protein concentration, at the upper limit of the pH range (i.e., BVDV: 4.97 and MMV: 4.93)
   and at the lower limit of the temperature range (i.e., at 29.4'C).
   [0172]      For Run 2 custom-made material (Lot number IGSC64) with a protein concentration
25 of 20.9% was taken. This material was used to perform runs at the upper limit of the possible
   protein concentration, at the upper limit of the pH range (i.e., BVDV: 4.92 and MIMV 4.86)
   and at the lower limit of the temperature range (i.e., 29.4'C).
    Virus Spike: BVDV, MMV
                  storage
   [0173] 45.5 ml of each starting material was spiked with 4.5 ml of virus stock suspension,
30 and a 1 ml-sample was drawn after 1 to 2 minutes of stirring. The sample was diluted
   immediately 1:3.16 (i.e., 1 volume of sample plus 2.16 volumes of cell culture medium) with
                                                        AR2

   the respective cell culture medium and titrated. Subsequently, another 3 ml sample was
   drawn and filtered through a 0.45 gm PVDF membrane. One ml of the filtered material was
   diluted immediately 1:3.16 with the respective cell culture medium and titrated.
   Adjustment ofpH
 5 [01741     An aliquot of 35 ml of the virus spiked starting material was adjusted to a pH of 4.9
   ± 0.1 (both runs) using a 0.5 M HCl solution under stirring. The material was then divided
   into two aliquots. One aliquot of 30 ml was used for the "Low pH Storage" and a 5 ml
   aliquot was used for the "temperaturehold control" (see section "Hold Controls").
    [01751    Another aliquot of 10 ml of the virus-spiked starting material was adjusted to a pH
10 of 7.0 ± 0.1 using a 0.5 M NaOH solution, where 5 ml of the pH-adjusted material were used
   for the "pHHold Control".
    [0176]    The remaining 5 ml of the pH adjusted material were used for the "CombinedpH
   and TemperatureHold Control" (see section "Hold Controls").
   Hold Controls
15  [01771     To investigate the mechanism of virus inactivation, i.e. by pH or by temperature,
   three hold controls were stored under different conditions:
    [01781     Each of the 5 ml-aliquots of the virus-spiked and pH adjusted (pH 7.0 ± 0.1) starting
   material were filtered through a 0.45 gm PVDF membrane filter into a cryovial. One aliquot
    was stored at 30     1VC, together with the spiked process material and then kept at this
20  temperature until the end of the process (pHHold Control, "pH HC'). The other aliquot was
    immediately stored at +2'C to +8'C for 27 days ± 5 hours (Combined pH and Temperature
    Hold Control, "c HC").
    [01791     The 5 ml-aliquot of the virus-spiked, pH-adjusted (pH 4.9 ± 0.1) and 0.45 gim
    filtered starting material (see above "Adjustment of pH") was immediately stored at +2*C to
25  +8*C until the end of the process (Temperature Hold Control, "t HC").
    [01801     The minimum volume of all Hold Controls after filtration was always more than 3
    ml, thus, a proper volume for virus titration after the storage period was available.
    Low pH Storage
     [01811    The 30 ml-aliquot of the virus spiked and pH adjusted (pH 4.9 ± 0.1) Subcuvia NG
30  intermediate was filtered through a 0.45 pim PVDF membrane filter into a 50 ml sterile glass

   bottle. The minimum volume of the Subcuvia NG intermediate after filtration was always
   more than 24 ml. Thus, enough volume for virus titration after the storage period was
   available. Subsequently, the temperature was equilibrated to 30 ± 1C under agitating back
   and forth in slow motion using a water bath, with the water bath regulated by a temperature
 5 controlled cryostat via an external temperature sensor. The external temperature sensor and
   an additional Pt 100 electrode were placed into one 50 ml glass bottle equivalent to those
   used for the low pH storage, each of them filled with 30 ml water, which was the maximal
   possible amount of spiked process material after filtration. The temperature was recorded
   continuously. As soon as the material reached a temperature of 290 C, sample taking was
10 initiated. Each sample was immediately diluted 1:3.16 (i.e. 1 volume of sample plus 2.16
   volumes of cell culture medium) with the respective cold cell culture medium (stored at +2'C
   to +8'C) to prevent further inactivation of virus by low pH, and titrated. In all runs the
   Subcuvia NG intermediate was stored under agitation (back and forth in slow motion) at 30
   1 C throughout the whole process for 27 days ± 5 hours, with a reduction of the temperature
15 to 25 ± 1*C for at least six hours (: 6 h) once every week of storage. Erroneously, the
   decrease in temperature to 25 ±1 C for 6 hours was performed twice per week in the first and
   in the second week of storage, i.e. during day 0 and 4 of storage in the first week and during
   day 7 and 10 of storage in the second week of the low pH treatment. For discussion, please
   refer to Section 4.1.1 ("Temperatureprofile ") . Further samples were drawn according to the
20 sampling plan (see Section 3.2), immediately diluted as described above and titrated. After
   completion of the low pH storage at 30'C       1PC, the pH was determined by direct
   measurement and by the method recommended by the European Pharmacopoeia (i.e., dilution
   to 1%protein with 0.9% NaCl solution).
    ControlRun without virus
25  [0182]    Two control runs were performed as described for the virus-spiked runs, where
   unspiked and 0.45 ptm filtrated Subcuvia NG intermediate is processed. The same process
   parameters apply as specified for the virus-spiked Runs 1 and 2, respectively, except that the
   material was not pH adjusted. Samples for determination of biochemical parameters were
   taken according to the sampling plan (see Section 3.2).
30  [01831    The cytotoxicity of the mock-spiked starting material (spiked 0.9:10 with BT
   medium for infected cells *; sample is filtered as described above before titration) and the
   mock-spiked and pH adjusted Subcuvia NG intermediate after 0.45 pim filtration was
    determined. Samples for determination of cytotoxicity were taken according to the sampling
    plan (see Section 3.2).
                                                    <n

            *    The composition of the BT-medium for infected cells is as follows: DMEM
                  (containing 4.5 g/l D-Glucose) + 1% (v/v) L-Glutamine (200 mM) + 1% (v/v)
                  Gentamicin Sulphate (10 mg/ml) + 1% (v/v) Sodium Pyruvate + 2% (v/v)
                  Sodium Bicarbonate (7.5%) + 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids + 5% (v/v)
 5               Horse serum.
   PotentialInterference
   [01841     The interference of the sample matrix for samples containing Subcuvia NG
   intermediate after pH adjustment (pH 4.9 ± 0.1) with the detection of viruses was investigated
   in duplicate for each indicator cell line as follows: a sample of 1 ml, drawn from the mock
10 spiked pH adjusted and 0.45 gm filtered Subcuvia NG intermediate, was diluted 1:3.16 (v/v)
   with the respective cold cell culture medium (stored at +2'C to +8'C). Subsequently, 1.8 ml
   of the diluted material was spiked 1:10 with 0.2 ml of pre-diluted* virus stock suspension to a
   calculated titer of 2.0 and 3.0 log 1o[TCID 50/ml]. After mixing, samples were drawn and
   titrated immediately. As a control, 1.8 ml of the respective cold cell culture medium (stored
15 at +2*C to +8'C) was spiked the very same way with pre-diluted virus stock suspension
   before titration.
            *     The appropriate cell culture medium [BT-medium for BT cells (BVDV), A9
                  medium for A9 cells (MMV)] was used for pre-dilution of virus stock
                  suspensions.

10 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
    [01901    The efficacy and robustness of the storage at low pH and elevated temperature of
   Subcuvia NG as a dedicated inactivation step for both lipid- and non-lipid-enveloped viruses,
   was investigated with BVDV and MMV, using a down-scaled laboratory model of this step.
   Validation parameters and biochemical parameters were defined and measured in the down
15 scaled process, and by comparison of the results with the conditions of the manufacturing
   process the equivalence of the two processes was established.
   Results for Validation and Biochemical Parameters
    Validation Parameters
    [0191]    The validity of the down-scaled procedure was verified by determination of the
20 parameters critical for virus inactivation, i.e., the pH of the process material, the temperature
   during low pH storage and the time of storage.
   pH value before storage at low pH and elevated temperature

   [01921     The pH of the spiked process material was measured and adjusted to 4.9 ± 0.1 in all
   runs, as required and was therefore within the limits specified in the Study Plan. The pH
   values determined after storage are discussed in Section 4.1.2 (Other Process and
   Biochemical Parameters).
 5 Temperatureprofile
    [0193]    To investigate the robustness of the storage step at low pH and elevated temperature
                                                                             0
   against temperature variations, the temperature was decreased from 30 C ±1 C to 25 ±1 C
   for 6 hours once every week of storage. The temperature was always within the ranges
   specified in the Study Plan. However, in the first and in the second week of storage, the
10 decrease in temperature to 25 ±1 C for 6 hours was erroneously performed twice per week,
   i.e., during day 0 and 4 in the first week and during day 7 and 10 in the second week. As this
   incident shifted the run profile to a worse scenario with respect to virus inactivation, the
   robustness of virus inactivation was even more extensively investigated than originally
   intended.
15 Storage Time
    [0194]    The duration of the storage at low pH and at elevated temperature is not specified
    for the manufacturing process of Subcuvia NG. Depending on the outcome of the current
    study, there are several options: one option for the duration of the storage time is 21 to 22
    days; a second option may be approximately 28 days. To investigate the efficacy and
20  robustness of the low pH treatment under conditions less favorable for virus inactivation all
    downscaled runs were performed below the lower limits of the possible storage time; i.e., for
    20 days ± 4 hours for the first option and storage for 27 days ± 5 hours for the second option.
    The spiked intermediate was stored at low pH and elevated temperature for 26 days + 22
    hours (MMV, both runs) and for 27 days + 1 hour (BVDV, both runs). In order to investigate
25  virus clearance after 3 weeks of storage, samples for virus titration were drawn after 20 days
    + 1 hour of storage for MMV and after 20 days + 2 hours for BVDV.
    [0195]    The storage time was within the specified limits for the down-scale, i.e., 20 days + 4
    hours, and 27 days ± 5 hours in all runs, which is below the currently considered lower limits
    of storage time in manufacturing.
30  Other Process and Biochemical Parameters
   pH after low pH storage

   [01961     Following low pH storage, the pH value was measured again directly as well as
   according to the method recommended by the European Pharmacopoeia (EP), i.e., dilution to
   1% protein with 0.9% NaCl solution. The pH measured by direct measurement after the
   treatment was close to the pH value before low pH storage; i.e., the differences ranged from
 5 0.07 to +0.04 (pH after minus pH before storage). The pH measured according to the EP
   method was always 0.2 to 0.3 higher compared to the direct measurement method. This
   slight increase of the pH values when using the EP method is typical for these two different
   methods in determination of the pH. This fact is also considered in the specified limits at
   manufacturing scale, where the limits for the pH after low pH treatment are 4.4 to 4.9 when
10 determined by direct measurement and 4.6 to 5.1 when determined by the EP method.
   Molecular Size Distribution(MSD)
    [0197]    The molecular size distribution (by HPLC analysis) was investigated before and
   after storage for the two unspiked control runs. The test results were compared to three
   "Scale-Up" lots, produced during the developmental stage of Subcuvia NG and to the custom
15 made material IGSC64 (14% as well as 20% protein concentration). Lot IGSC64, which is
   also designated as a "Scale-Up" lot was not subjected to an storage at low pH and elevated
   temperature in manufacture, as not enough material was available for this step. All results
   compared well to each other. Values for Molecular Size Distribution, especially percentage
    of IgG Monomers, were close to those observed in the "Scale Up" runs. For the second
20  control run, where the concentration of IgG monomers after storage was a few percentage
   points lower, it is noted that already the material before storage had a comparatively low
    concentration of IgG monomers, which also applies for the material tested within the "Scale
    Up" process. Thus, the molecular size distribution data support the equivalence of the down
    scale with the large-scale process.
25  Purity of Gammaglobulin
    [0198]    Purity of gammaglobulin (by CA-electrophoresis) of samples from the two unspiked
    control runs were determined and compared to the results obtained from two "Scale-Up" lots
    and from the custom made material IGSC64 (14% as well as 20% protein concentration,
    values only before low pH treatment, for explanation see above). All values determined for
30  the purity of gammaglobulin during the down-scaled process compared well to the results
    obtained for the "Scale Up" lots and were within the assay accuracy (the relative standard
    deviation is 1.5%). These results demonstrate the comparability of the down scaled to the
    manufacturing process.

   Results for Virus Titration
   Cytotoxicity
   101991      Cytotoxicity of intermediates obtained before storage at low pH and elevated
   temperature was investigated in control runs using mock-spiked material adjusted to the
 5 respective pH as described for the virus spiked runs. The mock-spiked process intermediates
   before and after pH adjustment showed only a very weak cytotoxic effect on the cells used in
   all two runs, except in run 2 on the BT cells, where the pH adjusted intermediate showed no
   cytotoxic effect from the 1.0 logo dilution and beyond. No significant differences in
   cytotoxicity were noticed for the virus-spiked runs.
10 Interference Testing
    [02001     Results from interference testing show no significant interference of the sample
   matrix with the detection of low titers of BVDV and MMV: Differences in virus titers
   between the spiked cell culture medium controls and the spiked Subcuvia NG intermediates
   were between -1.0 logio to 0.1 logio, which is within the accuracy of the virus titration assay.
15  Thus, titers obtained during the virus inactivation runs were not distorted by interference
    effects and represent the actual titer of the sample.
    Virus Inactivation
    [02011     Two runs were performed with each of the viruses BVDV and MMV, i.e. run 1 at
    13.5 % protein concentration, and run 2 at 20.9 % protein concentration. Both runs were
20  performed at pH 4.9 ± 0.1 and at 30       1PC, where the temperature was decreased to 25 ± PC
    for a minimum of 6 hours once per week. Comparison of the results of the two runs revealed
    no significant differences in virus inactivation kinetics between the two runs performed at the
    upper and the lower limit of the possible protein concentration of Subcuvia NG.
     [02021    Employing conditions least favorable for virus inactivation, i.e. the lower limits of
25  storage time and temperature, as well as upper limits of pH, significant inactivation of BVDV
    after 20 days ± 4 hours of storage and complete inactivation of all the virus that could be
     spiked into the respective Subcuvia NG intermediate after 27 days ± 5 hours of storage was
     demonstrated for BVDV, irrespective of the conditions investigated. In both runs residual
     infectivity from BVDV could be still be detected on day 20. However, all BVDV was
30   inactivated to below the limit of detection by the end of the 27 day storage. The reduction
     factors for MMV demonstrate a substantial contribution of this process step to the viral safety
     of the product, also with regard to non-lipid enveloped viruses. Individual virus titers and
                                                     5,;A

   reduction factors for the viruses used are discussed in more detail further below. In addition,
   graphical illustrations of the virus inactivation kinetics are given for each virus following the
   respective results-table.
   BVDV
 5  [0203]    BVDV was inactivated nearly to the limit of detection (run 1) or to the limit of
   detection (run 2) by day 20 of storage, providing for reduction factors of 5.3 logio and 5.5
   logo in runs 1 and 2, respectively. After 27 days of storage all BVDV spiked into the
   Subcuvia NG intermediate was inactivated to below the limit of detection for both runs, with
   reduction factors of >6.6 logo and >6.5 logo in runs 1 and 2, respectively. No significant
10 differences could be observed in the inactivation kinetics of the two runs. Both intermediates
   in run 1 (with 13.5% protein concentration)] and run 2 (with 20.9% protein concentration)
    showed comparable inactivation kinetics.
    [0204]    The low pH treatment at elevated temperature demonstrated effective inactivation of
    BVDV after storage for 20 days ± 4 hours, with a calculated mean reduction factor of 5.4
15  logo. After 27 days of storage at low pH and elevated temperature, complete inactivation of
    BVDV to below the limit of detection was achieved, where a mean reduction factor of >6.6
    logo was calculated.
   MMV
    [0205]    For MMV reduction factors of 2.9 logio and 3.1 logo were calculated for run 1 and
20  2, respectively, after 20 days of storage at low pH and elevated temperature. The calculated
    mean reduction factor is 3.0 logo. After 27 days of low pH treatment reduction factors of 3.4
    logo and 3.7 logo were obtained, where the calculated mean reduction factor is 3.6 logo.
    These reduction factors demonstrate a substantial contribution of this process step to the viral
    safety profile of the manufacturing process with regard to Parvoviruses, which are very
25  resistant towards physico-chemical inactivation. The virus inactivation kinetics in both runs
    was biphasic, with faster inactivation during the first 7 days and somewhat slower
    inactivation during the following three weeks.
    Hold Controls
     [0206]    To investigate the mechanism of virus inactivation, i.e., whether mediated by pH or
30  by temperature or by a combination of the two, three hold controls were kept under the
    respective conditions.

                                                                                              0
    [0207]     Titration of the "Combined Hold Control" (pH 7.0 ± 0.1) that were kept at 2 C to
    8C for 27 days ± 5 hours resulted for both viruses investigated in a virus titer comparable
    with the virus spiked starting material, except for MMV in run 2, where a small loss in titer
    (1.6 logio) was observed.
 5  [0208]      Storage at 30    1VC and pH 7.0 ± 0.1 ("pH Hold Control") showed that the lipid
    enveloped virus BVDV was very sensitive to storage at elevated temperature. BVDV was
    inactivated by 4.6 logo in both runs. Also, the non-lipid-enveloped virus MMV was
    inactivated by 3.3 and 3.8 logio, in run 1 and run 2, respectively.
    [0209]      Titration of the "Temperature Hold Controls" (t HC) after a 27 days ± 5 hours
10  storage at low pH and at 2'C to 8'C resulted for both viruses investigated in a virus titer
    comparable with the virus spiked starting material. These results demonstrate that BVDV as
    well as MMV were resistant to storage at low pH in the range of 4.4 to 4.9 at low
    temperature.
     [02101     Taken together, the results of the three Hold Controls suggest that:
15        e   Temperature would be the most significant factor for the inactivation of BVDV, with
              some contribution of the low pH (based on the fact that the control at 30 ± PC and
              neutral pH was substantially, but not completely inactivated after 27 days).
          *   For inactivation of MMV, temperature seemed to be the only relevant factor as the
              virus titers of the low pH kinetic samples after 27 days was virtually identical with the
20            control at neutral pH and 30*C.
     SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
     [0211]     In the course of the present study, a down-scaled model of the storage at low pH and
     elevated temperature in the manufacture of Subcuvia NG was established and its equivalence
     to the manufacturing procedure was demonstrated by determination of several process
25   parameters. In addition, a comparison of biochemical parameters of intermediates from the
     down-scaled model and the manufacturing process further supported the equivalence of both
     processes, indicating that the reduction factors obtained during the down-scale are also valid
      for the large scale. To investigate the robustness with regard to virus inactivation, the impact
      of different protein concentrations of Subcuvia NG was investigated, the pH of the spiked
 30   starting material was adjusted to the upper limit compared to the manufacturing process, and
      the impact of periodic decreases in temperature was investigated. The virus reduction factors
      and the inactivation kinetics obtained in the current study demonstrate that the lipid-

enveloped virus BVDV is effectively and robustly inactivated by storage at low pH and elevated
temperature within 27 days. Also, after storage at low pH and elevated temperature for 20 days a
significant inactivation of BVDV with a mean calculated reduction factor of 5.4 logio was
achieved for BVDV. The calculated mean reduction factors for the parvovirus model MMV, i.e.,
3.0 logo after 20 days of storage and 3.6 logo after 20 days of storage, show that this process
step further contributes to the viral safety of the manufacturing process with regard to small non
lipid-enveloped DNA viruses for high physicochemical resistance [2], for a storage time of 20 as
well as of 27 days.
[0212]        Both protein concentrations investigated showed the same inactivation kinetics for
MMV and BVDV, suggesting that the impact of protein concentration on the virus inactivation
capacity is not significant for concentrated Immunoglobulin solutions and the viruses BVDV and
MMV.
