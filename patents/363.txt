through the valve and an open configuration permitting flow through the valve in
response to pressure within each of the respective enclosed bodies.

     CONTAINERS AND METHODS FOR ISOLATING LIQUIDS PRIOR TO
                                    DISPENSING
                                         Field
[0001]         The present application is a divisional application from Australian
Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, which is a divisional application from
Australian Patent Application No. 2013368335, the entire disclosure of both
applications of which are incorporated herein by reference.
[0002]         Containers and methods for isolating liquids until dispensing are
provided and, in particular, for isolating and dispensing different liquids forming
at least part of a beverage.
                                    Background
[0003]      Concentrated liquids can be used to decrease the size of packaging
needed to supply a desired quantity of end result product. However, some
concentrated liquids may have a shelf life that is less than that desired due to
certain components. For example, an acid, such as citric or malic acid, added to
a liquid concentrate can decrease the shelf life of the liquid concentrate.
[0004]      Various attempts have been made to separate different components
from each other prior to dispensing. Some of those attempts involve providing a
device with a smaller chamber having a wall that is punctured to disperse their
contents into a larger chamber, such as described in U.S. Patent No. 7,017,735.
Other attempts are described in U.S. Patent Appl. Publ. Nos. 2008/0116221;
2009/0236303; 2008/0245683. One drawback of such devices is that the smaller
chamber can undesirably impede dispensing of the combined components.
Indeed, in some instances the smaller chamber is removed after it has been
punctured. This can limit the functionality and convenience of the devices.
Another drawback of such devices is that they are intended to mix all of the two
liquids together at the time of first use. This can be disadvantageous when the
mixed liquids are not intended to be consumed at the time of first use, but rather
over time.
                                           1

[0005]      Yet another problem with concentrated liquids is that they can include
concentrated amounts of dye so that after mixing, the resulting product has the
desired colouring. These dyes can stain surfaces, such as clothes, skin, etc., if
they come into contact with the surfaces.        Due to this, a container storing a
concentrated liquid is undesirable if it allows the liquid concentrate to drip or
otherwise leak from the container in an uncontrolled manner.          One form of
container releases a stream of liquid out of an opening when squeezed by a
user. When this type of container is utilized to store a concentrated liquid, at
least two problems can occur.        First, due to the staining problem discussed
above, if the concentrated liquid is squeezed into a container having a second
liquid therein, undesirable splashing can occur when the stream of concentrated
liquid impacts the liquid in the container. This splashed material can then stain
the surrounding surfaces, as well as the clothes and skin of a user.
[0006]      Additionally, unlike squeeze containers storing more solid contents
where the amount of material being dispensed can be visually assessed, such
as a ketchup or salad dressing bottle, a squeeze container dispensing a liquid
concentrate into another liquid can disadvantageously be hard for a user to
assess how much concentrated liquid has been dispensed in order to achieve
the desired end mixture.        Yet another problem can occur as the level of
concentrated liquid remaining in the container is reduced during repeated uses.
In this situation, the amount of concentrated liquid dispensed using the same
squeeze force can disadvantageously change significantly as the liquid
concentrate level changes within the container.
[0007]      A reference herein to a patent document or any other matter identified
as prior art, is not to be taken as an admission that the document or other matter
was known or that the information it contains was part of the common general
knowledge as at the priority date of any of the claims.
[0008]      Where any or all of the terms "comprise", "comprises", "comprised" or
"comprising" are used in this specification (including the claims) they are to be
interpreted as specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps or
                                            2

components, but not precluding the presence of one or more other features,
integers, steps or components.

                                 Detailed Description
[0034]      Containers configured for isolating a first and second fluid prior to
dispensing and then combining during dispensing are provided, as well as
methods of assembly and dispensing. The container is suitable for multiple
dispenses, and the fluids can be components of a beverage or beverage
concentrate. Advantageously, the first and second fluids are kept separate prior
to dispensing. Also advantageously, preferably only or substantially only the
dispensed portions of the first and second fluids are mixed during dispensing.
That is, not all of the first and second fluids are mixed during a given dispense
cycle. The isolation of the dispensed portions of the first and second fluids until
dispensing can restrict or prevent the ability of one of the fluids to interact with
the other of the fluids. Avoiding such interaction can increase the shelf life of the
filled container, such as when interaction of the fluids could decrease the shelf
life. Such isolation can be achieved while still providing for a container that does
not require complicated steps for dispensing.
                                          7

[0035]       With reference to the first exemplary embodiment of FIGURES 1-8,
the container 10 includes a body 12 with a cap 20 attached to the top.
Positioned beneath the underside of the cap 20 is an insert 30, as illustrated in
FIGURES 5, 7, and 8. The body 12 of container 10 includes a first enclosed
body 11 for storing a first fluid and a second enclosed body 13 for storing a
second fluid. Initially, first and second fluids, and in the exemplary case, first and
second beverage concentrate components, are maintained separately in
isolation in the container 12. However, when it is desirable to dispense a portion
(or all) of the concentrate components, pressure is applied to the outside of the
container 10 and a valve member 50 of the insert 30 is moved from a closed
position to an open position whereby the first and second beverage components
can exit the body 12 and insert 30, respectively, together.
[0036]       More specifically, each of the first and second beverage components
has an associated and separate exit flow path upstream of the valve member 50
when the valve member 50 is in its closed position. When the valve member 50
moves to its open position, portions of the first and second beverage
components can flow through their respective exit flow paths, mix upstream of
the valve member 50 and then pass through the valve member 50 for
dispensing, such as in a jet. The beverage concentrate can be dispensed into,
for example, water or other liquid, to form a beverage. Exemplary beverage
concentrates are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Appi . No. 61/320,155, filed April 1,
2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. It will be
appreciated that the volume ratio between the first and second beverage
components in first and second enclosed bodies 11 and 13 can be between
about 1:1 and 9:1, between about 1:1 and 4:1, or about 2:1. Suitable sizes of the
container, further details of its construction, exemplary beverage concentrates
and the numbers of doses therein are discussed in PCT/US2010/48449, filed
September 10, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[0037]       Turning to details of the first container embodiment 10, and with
reference to FIGURES 1-8, the body 12 is enclosed by a bottom wall 18, an
opposite shoulder 14 at the top portion of the body 12 and a sidewall 16
extending between the shoulder 14 and the bottom wall 18. A neck 15 extends
                                            8

upward from the shoulder 14 opposite the bottom wall 18 and defines a first
body access opening 58a that provides an entrance to and an exit from the first
enclosed body 11 and a second body access opening 58b that provides an
entrance to and an exit from the second enclosed body 13. The first enclosed
body 11 can store the first liquid and the second enclosed body 13 can store the
second liquid.
[0038]       In the illustrated form, the neck 15 includes opposed indents 17 and a
common wall 19, which maintains the first and second liquids separate from one
another as the first and second liquids flow through the neck 15. In the illustrated
form, the wall 19 extends through the neck 15 and from the base of the neck 15
to the bottom wall 18 of the body 12 to keep the first and second liquids
separate along the entire height of the body 12. It is to be appreciated that wall
19 does not have to extend through the entire height of the neck 15, but could
extend through just a portion of the height of the neck 15. It is also to be
appreciated that the wall 19 can provide an additional support structure within
the container body 12 such that the sidewall 16 can be less rigid yet the
container body 12 can maintain its structural integrity when exposed to external
forces during the attachment of the cap 20 or during the storage of the container
10. In the illustrated form, neck 15 and wall 19 provide structures for mounting of
the cap 20 and for supporting some or all of the insert 30, as will be described in
greater detail herein.
[0039]      The cap 20 is attached to the neck 15 of the body 12 of the container
10. The cap 20 includes a top wall 23, as illustrated in FIGURE 4, with a
depending skirt 24 about its periphery. A raised spout 46 defines an opening 48
extending through the top wall 23. In the illustrated form, the spout 46 is
cylindrical, but it is to be appreciated that other suitable shapes may be used for
the spout 46. A lid 26 of the cap 20, which is moveable between open and
closed positions, is configured to cover the spout 46 when the lid is in the closed
position. In the illustrated form, the lid 26 is pivotally connected to the remainder
of the cap 20 by a hinge 21 and can pivot about the hinge 21 from the open
position to the closed position. In one form, the lid 26 can be configured to snap
fit with the remainder of the cap 20. In this form, a recessed portion 22 can be
                                            9

provided along the periphery of the top wall 23 of the cap 20. The recessed
portion 22 is configured to receive the bottom surface 29 of lid 26 to form a snap
fit. In this form, a recessed portion 25 can be also provided in the skirt 24
adjacent the lid 26 when the lid 26 is pivoted to a closed position. The recessed
portion 25 can then facilitate access to a projecting ledge 27 of the lid 26 so that
a user can manipulate the ledge 27 to open the lid 26. In the illustrated form, the
lid 26 is generally dome-shaped, but the lid 26 can be of other suitable shapes.
[0040]       With reference to FIGURES 4 and 5, received within the opening 48
of the spout 46 is the valve member 50. In the illustrated form, the valve member
50 acts as a diaphragm, and has a flexible membrane or plate portion 52 with a
plurality of slits therein, and preferably two intersecting slits forming four
generally triangular flaps, as illustrated in FIGURE 4. So configured, when the
container 10 is squeezed, such as by depressing opposing portions of the
sidewall 16 toward each other, the first and second beverage components
stored in first and second enclosed bodies 11 and 13, respectively, are forced
against the membrane 52 which outwardly displaces the flaps to allow the
components to both mix together upstream of the membrane 52 of valve
member 50 to form a beverage concentrate and exit through a dispensing
aperture 53 in the membrane 52 in a jet. In one aspect, the jet of the beverage
concentrate emitted from the exemplary container 10 preferably combines
velocity and mass flow to impact a target liquid (not shown) within a target
container (not shown) to cause turbulence in the target liquid and create a
generally uniform mixed end product (not shown) without the use the extraneous
utensils or shaking.
[0041]       The lid 26 may further include a stopper 54 projecting from an interior
surface of the lid 26. Preferably, the stopper 54 is sized to snugly fit within the
spout 46, as illustrated in FIGURES 7 and 8, to provide additional protection
against unintended dispensing of the liquid beverage concentrate stored in first
and second enclosed bodies 11 and 13 or other leakage. In the illustrated form,
the stopper 54 can be a hollow, cylindrical projection. An optional inner plug 56
can be disposed within the stopper 54 and project further therefrom, and can
contact the membrane 52 of the valve member 50 disposed in the opening 48 of
                                          10

the spout 46. More specifically, the inner plug 56 can restrict movement of the
flaps of the membrane 52 of the valve member 50 from a concave orientation,
whereby they are closed, to a convex orientation, whereby the flaps are at least
partially open for dispensing.
[0042]      The stopper 54 can be configured to cooperate with the spout 46 to
provide one, two or more audible and/or tactile responses to a user during
closing. For example, sliding movement of the rearward portion of the stopper
54 past the rearward portion of the spout 46 - closer to the hinge 21 - can result
in an audible and tactile response as the lid 26 is moved toward a closed
position. Further movement of the lid 26 toward its closed position can result in a
second audible and tactile response as the forward portion of the stopper 54
slides past a forward portion of the spout 46 - on an opposite side of the
respective rearward portions from the hinge 21. Preferably the second audible
and tactile response occurs just prior to the lid 26 being fully closed. This can
provide audible and/or tactile feedback to the user that the lid 26 is closed.
[0043]      The cap 20 has an outer, generally cylindrical flange 28 depending
from the underside of the top wall 23 that is configured to engage the outer
surface of the neck 15, as shown in FIGURES 7 and 8. The outer surface of the
neck 15 includes, preferably adjacent its open upper end, a downwardly inclined
circumferential ramp 62, as illustrated in FIGURES 6-8. The distal portion of the
outer flange 28 of the cap 20 includes a circumferential, inwardly extending cap
ramp 64, as shown in FIGURES 7 and 8. The ramp 64 of the cap 20 and the
ramp 62 of the neck 15 are configured such that they can more readily be slid
past each other when the cap 20 is pressed downwardly about the neck 15 as
compared to when removal of the cap 20 from the neck 15 is attempted. In this
manner, the cap 20 can be attached to and retained on the neck 15 and hence
the body 12 of the container 10. The use of the term retain does not mean that it
is impossible to move from a given position; rather that there is some force that
must be overcome in order to do so. In order to attach the cap 20 to the neck 15,
the cap ramp 64 slides along the ramp 62 of the neck 15, with the neck 15
and/or the outer flange 28 of the cap 20 flexing away from each other until the
                                         11

ledges formed adjacent the respective ramps 64 and 62 interlock to restrict
outward removal of the cap 20.
[0044]      With reference to FIGURES 5, 7, and 8, the exemplary insert 30 in
the first embodiment comprises a hollow, cylindrical body portion 32 having two
opposed indents 36. Body portion 32 has a top wall 33, an outer flange 34
depending downwardly from the top wall 33, and an upwardly projecting annular
rim or valve seat 37 circumscribing an exit orifice 38, as depicted in FIGURE 5.
In the illustrated form, the insert 30 also includes an inner, generally cylindrical
flange 60 depending from the underside of the top wall 33. The inner flange 60
is disposed inwardly from the outer flange 34, and extends downwardly a shorter
distance from the top wall 33 of the insert 30 than outer flange 34. The spacing
between the inner and outer flanges 60 and 34 is selected so that the
upstanding, generally cylindrical neck 15 of the body 12 of the container 10 is
received therebetween, as shown in FIGURE 8. This provides a more secure fit
between container 12 and insert 30.
[0045]      The insert 30 is configured to be inserted partially into the neck 15 of
the body 12 of the container 10. In particular, when assembled, as depicted in
FIGURES 7 and 8, the inner flange 60 of the insert 30 is disposed at least
partially within the neck 15 of the container 10. After placement of the insert 30,
the cap 20 can be attached to the neck 15 of the body 12 of the container 10.
[0046]      When the insert 30 is inserted into the body 12 of the container 10
and the cap 20 is attached to the neck 15 thereof and the container 10 is in a
non-dispensing configuration, illustrated in FIGURE 8, the valve member 50 is
positioned to engage the projecting rim 37 of the insert 30. This engagement
has several objectives. A first of the objectives is to block the first beverage
component stored in the first enclosed body 11 from exiting the body 12 of the
container 10. A second of the objectives is to also block the second beverage
component stored in the second enclosed body 13 from exiting the body 12 of
the container 10. A third of the objectives is to maintain isolation between the
first and second beverage components stored in the first and second enclosed
bodies 11 and 13.
                                          12

[0047]       With respect to the first and second of the objectives of the
engagement between the projecting rim 37 of the insert 30 and the valve
member 50, the valve member 50 is positioned to block the exit or dispensing
path of the first and second beverage components stored within the first and
second enclosed bodies 11 and 13 from the body 12 of the container 10. In the
illustrated form, as shown in FIGURE 8, the dispensing or exit path of the first
and second beverage components extends from the first and second body
access openings 58a and 58b through the exit orifice 38 of the projecting rim 37
and into a region bounded by the bottom of the spout 46, a portion of the valve
member 50, and the projecting rim 37. The valve member 50 is movable
between a closed position, shown in FIGURE 4, blocking the dispensing path of
the first and second beverage components, and an open position (not shown)
permitting flow of the first and second beverage components through the exit
path. When the valve member 50 is in its closed position, illustrated in FIGURE
4, the slits of the membrane 52 of the valve member 50 are closed and block the
dispensing path of the first and second beverage components. However, when
the valve member 50 is moved to its open position, such as when the body 12 of
the container 10 is squeezed, the valve member 50 shifts to its open position
and the slits of the membrane 52 can open to permit the first and second
beverage components to flow through the dispensing aperture 53 formed
between the slits .
[0048]       In the illustrated form, when the valve member 50 is in the open
position (not shown) , the membrane 52 of the valve member 50 moves away
from the projecting rim 37 of the insert 30 such that a space or chamber (not
shown) is formed therebetween for the first and second beverage components
to flow through and then force the slits of membrane 52 of the valve member 50
to open and then exit past the dispensing aperture 53 between the slits.
[0049]       With respect to the third of the objectives, isolation between the first
and second beverage components is accomplished when the valve member 50
is in the closed position, as illustrated in FIGURES 7 and 8. When the valve
member 50 is moved to its open position (not shown) , such as when the body
12 of the container 10 is squeezed, the first and second beverage components
                                          13

are permitted to mix downstream of the first and second body access openings
58a and 58b and upstream of the valve member 50 before exiting through the
dispensing aperture 53 between the open slits of the membrane 52 of the valve
member 50.
[0050]      With reference to FIGURES 9-11, the exemplary insert 130 in the
second embodiment comprises a hollow, cylindrical body portion 132 having two
opposed indents 136. The body portion 132 has a top wall 133, an outer flange
134 depending downwardly from the top wall or surface 133, and an inner,
generally cylindrical flange 160 depending from the underside of the top wall
133. The inner flange 160 is disposed inwardly from the outer flange 134, and
extends downwardly a shorter distance from the top wall 133 of the insert 130
than outer flange 134. The spacing between the inner and outer flanges 160 and
134 is selected so that the upstanding, generally cylindrical neck 115 of the body
112 of the container 100 is received therebetween, as shown in FIGURE 10.
This provides a more secure fit between container 112 and insert 130.
[0051]      With reference to FIGURE 11, the top wall 133 of the insert 130
includes first and second exit orifices or openings 138a and 138b. Deflectors
137a and 137b extend upward from the top wall 133. Deflectors 137a and 137b
are positioned at least in part over the openings 138a and 138b, respectively,
and are shaped to deflect the flow path of the first and second fluids as they are
being dispensed through the insert 130 and first and second openings 138a and
138b. In the exemplary form, deflectors 137a and 137b are at least in part
curved and generally oriented in a converging orientation to one another, as
shown in FIGURES 10 and 11. The converging orientation redirects the first and
second fluids that flow through the openings 138a and 138b, respectively,
toward one another.
[0052]      The insert 130 is configured to be inserted partially into the neck 115
of the body 112 of the container 100. In particular, when assembled, as depicted
in FIGURE 10, the inner flange 160 of the insert 130 is disposed at least partially
within the neck 115 of the container 100. After placement of the insert 130, the
cap 120 can be attached to the neck 115 of the body 112 of the container 100.
                                        14

[0053]      The cap 120 includes a top wall 123, as illustrated in FIGURES 9 and
10, with a depending skirt 124 about its periphery. A raised spout 146 defines
dispensing apertures 148a and 148b extending through the top wall 123 of the
cap 120, as shown in FIGURES 9 and 10. In the illustrated form, the spout 146
is cylindrical, but it is to be appreciated that other suitable shapes may be used
for the spout 146. Received at least in part within the spout 146 is a common
wall 119a, which maintains the first and second liquids separate from one
another as the first and second liquids flow through the first and second
dispensing channels of the spout 146. In the illustrated form, the wall 119a
extends through the spout 146. With reference to FIGURE 10, one or more ribs
170 project downwardly from the underside of the top wall 123. The top wall 133
of the insert 130 includes one or more grooves 180 sized and shaped to receive
one or more of the ribs 170 and a portion of the common wall 119a, thereby
providing a more secure fit and a tighter seal between the cap 120 and the insert
130.
[0054]      In the illustrated form, as shown in FIGURE 10, the maximum cross
sectional dimension of the container 112 is greater than the maximum cross
sectional dimension of the neck 115, which is greater than the maximum cross
sectional dimension of the spout 146. Accordingly, the wall 119 has a greater
maximum cross-sectional dimension in the body 112 than it does in the neck
115. Similarly, the maximum cross-sectional dimension of the wall 119 in the
neck 115 is greater than the maximum cross-sectional dimension of wall 119a in
the spout 146. Further, as shown in FIGURE 10, body access openings 158a
and 158b have a greater maximum               cross-sectional dimension than the
maximum cross-sectional dimension of the dispensing apertures 148a and
148b, respectively. Further, in the illustrated form shown in FIGURE 10, body
access openings 158a and 158b are offset from the dispensing apertures 148a
and 148b, respectively. In addition, FIGURE 10 shows that the body access
openings 158a and 158b each have a maximum cross-sectional area greater
than the maximum cross-sectional area of each of the exit orifices 138a and
138b, and the central axes of the exit orifices 138a and 138b are closer together
than the central axes of the body access openings 158a and 158b. At least for
these reasons, the deflectors 137a and 137b are oriented to redirect the flow of
                                           15

the first and second liquids inwardly, i.e., toward the wall 119a, as shown in
FIGURE 10.
[0055]      When the container 100 is squeezed, such as by depressing
opposing portions of the sidewall 116 toward each other, the first and second
beverage components stored in the first and second enclosed bodies 111 and
113 are forced out of the first and second body access openings 158a and 158b,
respectively. Upon exit from the first and second body access openings 158a
and 158b, the first and second liquids follow the first and second dispensing
paths, respectively. In particular, the first and second liquids flow into the
entrance and out of the exit of exit orifices 138a and 138b of the insert 130.
Upon exiting from the exit orifices 138a and 138b, the first and second liquids
come into contact with and are redirected by the deflectors 137a and 137b of the
insert. In the illustrated form, as discussed above, and shown in FIGURES 10
and 11, the preferred shape and orientation of the deflectors 137a and 137b are
such that the first and second fluids are redirected generally in the direction
toward one another and toward the wall 119a. The first and second fluids then
enter the spout 146 and flow through the first and second dispensing channels
in the spout 146 while being separated by the wall 119a and exit from the
dispensing apertures 148a and 148b, respectively, in jets. It is to be appreciated
that the jets may be either parallel, converging, or diverging relative to one
another.
[0056]      In the illustrated form, the lid 126 may further include a stopper 154
projecting from an interior surface of the lid 126, as shown in FIGURE 10.
Preferably, the stopper 154 is sized to contact the spout 146 and cover the top
surface 147 of the spout 146, including dispensing apertures 148a and 148b, to
provide additional protection against unintended dispensing of the liquid
beverage concentrate stored in first and second enclosed bodies 111 and 113 or
other leakage. In the illustrated form, the stopper 154 can be a hollow, cylindrical
projection. An optional inner plug 156 can be disposed within the stopper 154
and project further therefrom, and can contact the top surface 147 of the spout
146 and cover just the dispensing apertures 148a and 148b to prevent leakage
therefrom.
                                           16

[0057]      With reference to FIGURES 13-15, the exemplary insert 230 in the
third embodiment comprises a hollow, cylindrical body portion 232 having two
opposed indents 236. Body portion 232 has a top surface or wall 233, an outer
flange 234 depending downwardly from the top wall 233, and an inner, generally
cylindrical flange 260 depending from the underside of the top wall 233. The
inner flange 260 is disposed inwardly from the outer flange 234, and extends
downwardly a shorter distance from the top wall 233 of the insert 230 than outer
flange 234. The spacing between the inner and outer flanges 260 and 234 is
selected so that the upstanding, generally cylindrical neck 215 of the body 212
of the container 200 is received therebetween, as shown in FIGURE 14. This
provides a more secure fit between container 212 and insert 230.
[0058]      With reference to FIGURES 14 and 15, the top wall 233 of the insert
230 includes at least first and second exit orifices 238a and 238b. Valves 237a
and 237b extend upward from the top wall 233 and cover exit orifices 238a and
238b. In the illustrated form, valves 237a and 237b can be duck-bill valves.
Typically, duck-bill valves 237a and 237b are made from a rubber or synthetic
material. In the illustrated embodiment, valves 237a and 237b are oriented
generally parallel to one another and generally perpendicular to the top wall 233
of insert 230 such that the first and second fluids flow through the valves 237a
and 237b in a direction generally parallel to one another. When the valves 237a
and 237b are in their closed position, illustrated in FIGURE 13, the dispensing
apertures 239a and 239b are closed and block the dispensing path of the first
and second beverage components. However, when the valves 237a and 237b
are in their open positions, such as when the body 212 of the container 200 is
squeezed, the valves 237a and 237b can open to permit the first and second
beverage components to flow through the dispensing apertures 239a and 239b
in the valves 237a and 237b.
[0059]      The insert 230 is configured to be inserted partially into the neck 215
of the body 212 of the container 200. In particular, when assembled, as depicted
in FIGURE 14, the inner flange 260 of the insert 230 is disposed at least partially
within the neck 215 of the container 200. After insertion of the insert 230, the
cap 220 can be attached to the neck 215 of the body 212 of the container 200.
                                        17

[0060]       In the illustrated form, the cap 220 includes a top wall 223, as shown
in FIGURES 13 and 14, with a depending skirt 224 about its periphery. In the
illustrated form, as shown in FIGURES 13 and 14, valves 137a and 137b of the
insert 230 extend through the top wall 223 and through the first and second
dispensing channels or openings in the top wall 223. As shown in FIGURE 14,
body access openings 258a and 258b have a greater maximum cross-sectional
dimension than the maximum cross-sectional dimensions of the valves 237a
and 237b, and of the exit orifices 238a and 238b, respectively.
[0061]       When the container 200 is squeezed, such as by depressing
opposing portions of the sidewall 216 toward each other, the first and second
beverage components stored in the first and second enclosed bodies 211 and
213 are forced out of the first and second body access openings 258a and 258b,
respectively. Upon exiting from the first and second body access openings 258a
and 258b, the first and second liquids follow the first and second dispensing
paths, respectively. In particular, the first and second liquids flow into the
entrance and out of the exit of exit orifices 238a and 238b of insert 230. Upon
exiting from the exit orifices 238a and 238b, the first and second fluids then
enter the valves 237a and 237b, flow through the valves 237a and 237b and exit
from the dispensing apertures 239a and 239b, respectively, in jets.
[0062]       In each of the foregoing embodiments, as shown in FIGURES 7, 8,
10, and 14, a gasket 40 is optionally provided between the necks 15, 115, and
130 of the containers 10, 100, and 200, and the inserts 30, 130, and 230. With
reference to FIGURE 12, the gasket 40 includes a generally cylindrical body 42
with opposed indents 47 and has a first opening 43 and a second opening 44
separated by a strip or bridge 45. The gasket 40 is shaped to match the shape
of the necks 15, 115, 215 of the containers 10, 100, and 200, and the shape of
the underside of the inserts 30, 130, and 230. In the illustrated forms, the gasket
40 sits at least in part on the neck of the containers and is at least in part
surrounded by the outer flanges 34, 134, 234 of the inserts 30, 130, and 230.
The gasket 40 increases the seal between the first and second body access
openings 58a, 158a, 258a and 158b, 158b, 258b, and the outer flanges 34, 134,
234 of the inserts 30, 130, and 230.
                                            18

[0063]       In the forms illustrated in FIGURES 1-15, the first enclosed body 11,
111, 211 and the second enclosed body 13, 113, and 213 are positioned side
by-side and are identical mirror images of one another. Also, in the forms
illustrated in FIGURES 1-15, each exemplary container 10, 200, and 300 is a
unitary structure that includes first and second enclosed bodies 11, 111, 211,
13, 113, and 113, respectively. The unitary structure of the exemplary containers
10, 100, and 200 can be formed by blow-molding techniques, or alternatively, by
injection molding.
[0064]       With reference to FIGURES 16 and 17, an alternative exemplary form
of a container 300 configured for isolating a first and second fluid prior to
dispensing and then combining during dispensing is provided. The container 300
is formed by the attachment of two separate first and second enclosed bodies
300a and 300b.
[0065]       With reference to FIGURES 16 and 17, the container 300 comprises
a first enclosed body 300a and a second enclosed body 300b. The first and
second enclosed bodies 300a and 300b are preferably, though not necessarily,
identical and the description of the structure of the first enclosed body 300a
equally applies to the structure of the second enclosed body 300b.
[0066]       With reference to FIGURE 16, the first enclosed body 300a includes
an interior enclosed by a bottom wall 318a, an opposite shoulder 314a at the top
portion of the body 300a, and a sidewall 316a extending between the shoulder
314a and the bottom wall 318a. A neck 315a extends upward from the shoulder
314a opposite the bottom wall 318a and defines a first body access opening
358a that provides an entrance to and an exit from the first enclosed body 300a.
In the illustrated form, the outer surface of the neck 315a of first enclosed body
300a includes a downwardly inclined circumferential ramp 362a, as illustrated in
FIGURE 16, for the use in attachment of a cap as described previously and
additionally described with reference to FIGURES 19 and 21 below.
[0067]       With reference to FIGURE 17, the second enclosed body 300b
includes an interior enclosed by a bottom wall (not shown), an opposite shoulder
314b at the top portion of the body 300b, and a sidewall 316b extending
                                           19

between the shoulder 314b and the bottom wall. A neck 315b extends upward
from the shoulder 314b opposite the bottom wall and defines a second body
access opening 358b that provides an entrance to and an exit from the second
enclosed body 300b. The first and second enclosed bodies 300a and 300b of
container 300 can store the first and second liquids, respectively, separately
from one another until the user desires to dispense the first and second liquids.
[0068]       Sidewall 316a of first enclosed body 300a includes one or more
protuberances 320a and one or more recesses 322a, while sidewall 316b of the
second enclosed body 300b includes one or more recesses and protuberances
(not shown) complementary to protuberances 320a and recesses 322a,
respectively. In the illustrated form, first enclosed body 300a and second
enclosed body 300b are positioned such that one or more protuberances 320a
of the first enclosed body 300a mate with one or more recesses of the second
enclosed body 300b and vice versa, thereby bringing sidewalls 316a and 316b
into contact and securely retaining first and second enclosed bodies 300a and
300b to one another to form the exemplary container 300, as shown in FIGURE
17. The protuberances 320a of first enclosed body 300a and the complementary
recesses of the second enclosed body 300b can alone be sufficient to join the
bodies 300a and 300b. Instead or in addition, adhesives, welding and/or other
interlocking structures may be utilized.
[0069]       The exemplary container 300, like the exemplary containers 10, 100,
200, can be used with any of inserts 30, 130, and 230, and with any of caps 14,
114, 214, and with the gasket 40 described with reference to FIGURES 1- 15.
For example only, a gasket 40 can be inserted into insert 230, insert 230 can be
fitted over the necks 315a and 315b, and the cap 214 with a lid 226 can be
secured to the shoulders 314a and 314b of the first and second enclosed bodies
300a and 300b to cover both necks 315a and 315b. So configured, when the
container 300 is squeezed, such as by depressing opposing portions of the
sidewalls 316a and 316b toward each other, the first and second beverage
components stored in first and second enclosed bodies 300a and 300b,
respectively, are forced through the valves 237a and 237b of the insert 230 and
exit from the dispensing apertures 238a and 238b in jets.
                                         20

[0070]      With reference to FIGURE 18, a cap 120 according to another
exemplary form is shown. The cap 120 is configured for use with the containers
300a and 300b and can be attached to the necks 315a and 315b of the
containers 300a and 300b, as shown in FIGURE 19. Similar to the cap 20
described above, the cap 120 includes a top wall 123 with a depending skirt 124
about its periphery. A raised spout 146 defines an opening 148 extending
through the top wall 123. The cap 120 includes a lid 126 moveable between
open and closed positions and configured to cover the spout 146 when the lid
126 is in the closed position.
[0071]      As shown in FIGURE 19, the lid 126 is pivotally connected to the
remainder of the cap 120 by a hinge 121 and can pivot about the hinge 121 from
the open position to the closed position. In one form, the lid 126 can be
configured to snap fit with the remainder of the cap 120. In this form, a recessed
portion 122 can be provided along the periphery of the top wall 123 of the cap
120. The recessed portion 122 is configured to receive the bottom surface 129
of the lid 126 to form a snap fit. In the illustrated form, the lid 126 is generally
dome-shaped, but the lid 126 can be of other suitable shapes.
[0072]      In the form illustrated in FIGURE 18, the cap 120 has two generally
arc-shaped flanges 128a and 128b depending from the underside of the top wall
123. The flanges 128a and 128b are positioned opposite one another and
configured to engage the outer surface of the necks 315a and 315b of the
containers 300a and 300b, respectively, as described in more detail below.
[0073]      In particular, as shown in FIGURES 18 and 19, the distal portions of
the flanges 128a and 128b of the cap 120 include inwardly extending ramps
164a and 164b, respectively. The outer surfaces of the necks 315a and 315b
include downwardly inclined circumferential ramps 362a and 362b, respectively.
The ramps 164a and 164b of the flanges 128a and 128b of the cap 120 and the
ramps 362a and 362b of the necks 315a and 315b of the containers 300a and
300b are configured such that they can more readily be slid past each other
when the cap 120 is pressed downwardly about the necks 315a and 315b as
compared to when removal of the cap 120 from the necks 315a and 315b is
                                          21

attempted. In this manner, the cap 120 can be attached to and retained on the
necks 315a and 315b and hence each container 300a and 300b. As discussed
above, the use of the term retain does not mean that it is impossible to move
from a given position; rather that there is some force that must be overcome in
order to do so.
[0074]      In order to attach the cap 120 to the necks 315a and 315b, the ramps
164a and 164b of the flanges 128a and 128b slide along the ramps 362a and
362b of the necks 315a and 315b, with the necks 315a and 315b and/or the
flanges 128a and 128b of the cap 120 flexing away from each other until the
ledges formed adjacent the respective ramps 164a and 164b and 362a and
362b interlock with each other as shown in FIGURE 19 to restrict removal of the
cap 120 from the necks 315a and 315b of the containers 300a and 300b.
[0075]      The cap 120 includes an exemplary insert 130 coupled to the cap
120, as shown in FIGURES. 18 and 19. The insert 130 is generally circular and
includes a top wall 133. The insert 130 has a pair of opposed generally arcuate
flanges 134 and 136 depending downwardly from the top wall 133. Interior
facing surfaces of the flanges 134 and 136 include hollow cylindrical projections
135 and 137 configured to permit the pins 125 and 127, which depend
downward from the top wall 123 of the cap 120, to pass therethrough in a friction
fit to removably couple the insert 130 to the cap 120.
[0076]      The insert 130 also includes an upwardly projecting annular rim or
valve seat 137 circumscribing an exit orifice 138, as depicted in FIGURE 19.
Received within the exit orifice 138 of the insert 130 is a flexible valve member
150, which is identical to the valve member 50 described above. As shown in
FIGURE 19, the valve seat 137 is received within the opening 148 of the spout
146.
[0077]      The insert 130 also includes two generally tubular members 138 and
140 depending from the underside of the top wall 133. The tubular members 138
and 140 are configured to be insertable in a friction fit into the openings 358a
and 358b in the necks 315a and 315b of the containers 300a and 300b to
                                         22

couple the insert 130 and the cap 120 to the containers 300a and 300b, as
depicted in FIGURE 19.
[0078]       Sealing rings 142 and 144 are positioned around the tubular
members 138 and 140 proximate the base of each of the tubular members 138
and 140, as depicted in FIGURES 18 and 19. The sealing rings 142 and 144
provide for a substantially water-tight connection between the tubular members
138 and 140 and the interior surfaces of the necks 315a and 315b of the
containers 300a and 300b, respectively. The top wall 133 of the insert 130
includes through holes forming passages 139 and 141 positioned within the
circumference of the tubular members 138 and 140, respectively, as shown in
FIGURE 18. During the dispensing of the contents of the containers 300a and
300b by a user, the passages 139 and 141 of the insert 130 permit the flow of
one or more liquids from the interior of the containers 300a and 300b as
discussed in more detail below.
[0079]       The insert 130 includes four downwardly extending generally arcuate
flanges 146a, 146b, 148a and 148b, as illustrated in FIGURE 18. The flanges
146a, 146b, 148a and 148b extend downwardly a longer distance from the top
wall 133 of the insert 130 than the flanges 134 and 136. The flanges 146a and
146b are located on opposite sides of the tubular member 138 while the flanges
148a and 148b are positioned on opposite sides of the tubular member 140. It is
to be appreciated that the number and position of the flanges 146a, 146b, 148a,
and 148b has been shown by way of example only and any suitable number of
these flanges can be positioned in any suitable arrangement adjacent the
tubular members 138 and 140.
[0080]       The flanges 146a, 146b, 148a, and 148b of the insert 130 are sized
and shaped to at least partially surround the necks 315a and 315b of the
containers 300a and 300b. In particular, when the cap 120 and the containers
300a and 300b are assembled, as shown in FIGURE 19, the tubular members
138 and 140 are disposed at least partially in a friction fit within the necks 315a
and 315b, while the flanges 146a, 146b, 148a, and 148b are disposed at least
partially in a friction fit around the exterior of the necks 315a and 315b. As such,
                                            23

the necks 315a and 315b are at least in part retained between the tubular
members 138 and 140 and the flanges 146a, 146b, 148a, and 148b such that a
secure fit is formed between the cap 120, the insert 130, and the containers
300a and 300b, restricting potential dislodging of the cap 120 from the
containers 300a and 300b during transportation or use by a consumer.
[0081]      The dispensing or exit path of the first and second beverage
components extends from the first and second body access openings 358a and
358b through the passages 139 and 141 and the exit orifice 138 of the
projecting rim 137, and into a region bounded by the bottom of the spout 146, a
portion of the valve member 150, and the projecting rim 137, as shown in
FIGURES 17-19. The valve member 150 of the insert 130 is identical to the
valve member 50 discussed above and is movable between a closed position
shown in FIGURE 19, blocking the dispensing path of the first and second
beverage components, and an open position (not shown) permitting flow of the
first and second beverage components through the exit path.
[0082]      A cap 220 according to yet another exemplary embodiment is shown
in FIGURE 20. Similar to the cap 120, the cap 220 is configured for use with the
containers 300a and 300b and can be attached to the necks 315a and 315b of
the containers 300a and 300b, as shown in FIGURE 21. The cap 220 includes a
top wall 223 with a depending skirt 224 about its periphery. A raised spout 246
defines an opening 248 extending through the top wall 223. The cap 220
includes a lid 226 moveable between open and closed positions and configured
to cover the spout 246 when the lid 226 is in the closed position. The lid 226
illustrated in FIGURE 21 is identical to the lid 126 shown in FIGURE 19 and will
not be separately discussed.
[0083]      The cap 220 has two generally arc-shaped flanges 228a and 228b
depending from the underside of the top wall 223, as depicted in FIGURE 20.
The flanges 228a and 228b of the cap 220 have a shorter length and a smaller
radius of curvature than the flanges 128a and 128b of the cap 120, as shown in
FIGURES 18 and 20. Similar to the flanges 128a and 128b of the cap 120, the
flanges 228a and 228b of the cap 220 are opposite one another and configured
                                         24

to engage the outer surface of the necks 315a and 315b of the containers 300a
and 300b, respectively, as described in more detail below.
[0084]      The distal portions of the flanges 228a and 228b of the cap 220
include inwardly extending ramps 264a and 264b, respectively, as illustrated in
FIGURES 20 and 21. The outer surfaces of the necks 315a and 315b include
downwardly inclined circumferential ramps 362a and 362b, respectively. The
ramps 264a and 264b of the flanges 228a and 228b of the cap 220 and the
ramps 362a and 362b of the necks 315a and 315b of the containers 300a and
300b are configured such that they can more readily be slid past each other
when the cap 220 is pressed downwardly about the necks 315a and 315b as
compared to when removal of the cap 220 from the necks 315a and 315b is
attempted. In this manner, the cap 220 can be attached to and retained on the
necks 315a and 315b of the containers 300a and 300b.
[0085]       In order to attach the cap 220 to the necks 315a and 315b, the ramps
264a and 264b of the flanges 228a and 228b slide along the ramps 362a and
362b of the necks 315a and 315b, with the necks 315a and 315b and/or the
flanges 228a and 228b of the cap 220 flexing away from each other until the
ledges formed adjacent the respective ramps 264a and 264b and 362a and
362b interlock with each other as shown in FIGURE 21 to restrict removal of the
cap 220 from the necks 315a and 315b of the containers 300a and 300b.
[0086]      The cap 220 includes an exemplary insert 230 coupled to the cap
220, as shown in FIGURES 20 and 21. The insert 230 is partially circular but
includes four recessed portions 231 that allow the insert 230 to be positioned at
least partly outside of an area between the arcuate flanges 228a and 228b. The
insert 230 includes a top wall 233 and a pair of opposed generally arcuate
flanges 234 and 236 depending downwardly from the top wall 233. In the
illustrated form, the interior facing surfaces of the flanges 134 and 136 include
hollow cylindrical projections 135 and 137 that permit the pins 225 and 227,
which depend downward from the top wall 223 of the cap 220, to pass
therethrough in a friction fit to removably couple the insert 230 to the cap 220.
                                          25

[0087]      The insert 230 also includes an upwardly projecting annular rim or
valve seat 237 circumscribing an exit orifice 238, as depicted in FIGURE 21.
Received within the exit orifice 238 of the insert 230 is a flexible valve member
250, which is identical to the valve members 50 and 150. The valve seat 237 is
received within the opening 248 of the spout 246, as shown in FIGURE 21.
[0088]      Similar to the insert 130, the insert 230 also includes two generally
tubular members 238 and 240 depending from the underside of the top wall 233.
The tubular members 238 and 240 are configured to be insertable in a friction fit
into the openings 358a and 358b in the necks 315a and 315b of the containers
300a and 300b to couple the insert 230 and the cap 220 to the containers 300a
and 300b, as shown in FIGURE 21.
[0089]      The Sealing rings 242 and 244 are positioned around the tubular
members 238 and 240 proximate the base of each of the tubular members 238
and 240, as illustrated in FIGURES 20 and 21. The sealing rings 242 and 244
provide for a substantially water-tight connection between the tubular members
238 and 240 and the interior surfaces of the necks 315a and 315b of the
containers 300a and 300b, respectively. The top wall 233 of the insert 230
includes through holes forming passages 239 and 241 positioned within the
circumference of the tubular members 238 and 240, respectively, as shown in
FIGURE 20. During the dispensing of the contents of the containers 300a and
300b by a user, the passages 239 and 241 of the insert 230 permit the flow of
one or more liquids from the interior of the containers 300a and 300b as
discussed in more detail below.
[0090]      The insert 230 includes two downwardly extending generally arcuate
flanges 246 and 248, as depicted in FIGURE 20. The flanges 246 and 248
extend downwardly a longer distance from the top wall 233 of the insert 230
than the flanges 234 and 236. The flanges 246 and 248 are located on opposite
sides of the tubular members 238 and 240 relative to the arcuate flanges 228a
and 228b of the cap 220. The flanges 246 and 248 of the cap 220 have a longer
length but a smaller radius of curvature than the flanges 146a, 146b, 148a, and
148b of the cap 120, as shown in FIGURES 18 and 20. It will be appreciated
                                         26

that the size, number, and position of the flanges 246 and 248 has been shown
by way of example only and any suitable number of flanges of suitable sizes can
be positioned in any suitable arrangement adjacent the tubular members 238
and 240.
[0091]      The flanges 246 and 248 of the insert 230 are sized and shaped to at
least partially surround the necks 315a and 315b of the containers 300a and
300b. In particular, when the cap 220 and the containers 300a and 300b are
assembled as shown in FIGURE 21, the tubular members 238 and 240 of the
insert 230 are disposed at least partially in a friction fit within the necks 315a and
315b, while the flanges 228a and 228b of the cap 220 and the flanges 246 and
248 of the insert 230 are disposed at least partially in a friction fit around the
exterior of the necks 315a and 315b.
[0092]      The flanges 228a and 228b of the cap 220 are approximately twice as
long as the flanges 246 and 248 of the insert 230 such that the distal ends of the
flanges 228a and 228b extend below the ramps 362a and 362b, respectively,
while the distal ends of the flanges 246 and 248 are positioned above the ramps
362a and 362b, respectively, as shown in FIGURE 21. The necks 315a and
315b are at least in part retained between the tubular members 238 and 240
and the flanges 228a, 228b, 246 and 248, such that a secure fit is formed
between the cap 220, the insert 230, and the containers 300a and 300b,
restricting potential dislodging of the cap 220 from the containers 300a and 300b
during transportation or use by a consumer.
[0093]      The dispensing or exit path of the first and second beverage
components extends from the first and second body access openings 358a and
358b through the passages 239 and 241 and the exit orifice 238 of the
projecting rim 237, and into a region bounded by the bottom of the spout 246, a
portion of the valve member 250, and the projecting rim 237, as depicted in
FIGURES 20 and 21. The valve member 250 of the insert 230 is identical to the
valve member 50 discussed above and is movable between a closed position
shown in FIGURE 21, blocking the dispensing path of the first and second
                                          27

beverage components, and an open position (not shown) permitting flow of the
first and second beverage components through the exit path.
[0094]      The foregoing containers described herein may have resilient
sidewalls that permit them to be squeezed to dispense the liquid concentrate or
other contents. In particular, the body 12 of the container 10 can be resilient. By
resilient, what is meant that they return to or at least substantially return to their
original configuration when no longer squeezed. Further, the containers may be
optionally provided with structural limiters for limiting displacement of the
sidewall, i.e., the degree to which the sidewalls can be squeezed. This can
advantageously contribute to the consistency of the discharge of contents from
the containers.
[0095]      The drawings and the foregoing descriptions are not intended to
represent the only forms of the containers and methods in regards to the details
of construction, assembly and operation. Changes in form and in proportion of
parts, as well as the substitution of equivalents, are contemplated as
circumstances may suggest or render expedient.
