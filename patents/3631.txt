Description of the Related Art
         The human immune system generally protects the body from damage by foreign
substances and pathogens. One way in which the immune system protects the body is by
producing specialized cells, referred to as T lymphocytes or T-cells. Intercellular interactions
between T-cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) generate T-cell costimulatory signals
that in turn lead to
(14711302 1):GGG

   T-cell responses to antigens. Full T cell activation requires both binding of the
   T-cell receptor (TCR) to antigen-MHC complex present on antigen-presenting
   cells and binding of the receptor CD28 on the surface of the T-cell to the CD86
   and/or CD80 ligands present on antigen-presenting cells, particularly dendritic
 5 cells.
                    CD80 (also known as B7-1) was originally described as a human
   B-cell associated activation antigen and was subsequently found to be a
   receptor for the related T-cell molecules CD28 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte
   associated antigen-4 (CTLA4). In later studies, another counterreceptor for
10 CTLA4 known as CD86 (also known as B7-0 or B7-2) was identified. CD86
   shares about 25% sequence identity with CD80 in its extracellular region.
   While CD80 and CD86 are generally believed to be functionally equivalent in
   their ability to initiate and maintain proliferation of CD4(+) T cells (Vasilevko et
   al. (2002) DNA Cell Biol. 21:137-49), and clinical data with a soluble CTLA4 Ig
15 fusion protein that blocks this activity for both molecules has shown clinical
   benefit (Genovese et al. (2005) NEJM 353:114-1123), there is some evidence
   that specific inhibition of CD86 might be of benefit. For example, engagement
   of CD86 or CD80 has different effects on B cells. Specifically, CD80 has been
   shown to provide a negative signal for the proliferation and igG secretion of
20 both normal B cells and B cell lymphomas, while CD86 enhances the activity of
   B cells (Suvas et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277:7766-7775). There is also some
   evidence that engagement of CD80 on T cells is immunosuppressive (Lang et
   al. (2002) J. Immunol. 168:3786-3792; Taylor et al. (2004) J. Immunol. 172:34
   39; Paust et al. (2004) PNAS 101:10398-10403) and that it may mediate further
25 immunosuppression through PD-Li (CD274) signaling on activated APCs or T
   cells (Butte et al. (2007) Immunity 27:111-122; Keir (2008) Ann. Rev. Immunol.
   26:677-704). Accordingly, inhibition of CD86 in the absence of CD80 inhibition
   may be beneficial in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disease as
   well as B cell lymphomas.
30                  CTLA4 is a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein of the
   immunoglobulin superfamily that is mainly expressed in activated T-cells, with
   some expression also being found in the CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cell (Treg)
   subset. CD86 and CD80 are believed to be the only endogenous ligands for
   CTLA4. CTLA4 has been shown to bind CD86 and CD80 with greater affinity
35 and avidity compared with CD28 (Linsley et al. (1991) J. Exp. Med. 174:561-69;
   Linsley et al. (1994) Immunity 1:793-801), and plays a key role as a negative
                                               2

   regulator of T-cell activation. Specifically, binding of CTLA4 to CD80/CD86
   leads to downregulation of T-cell responses and to the preservation of T-cell
   homeostasis and peripheral tolerance. This is believed to be due to both
   antagonism of CD28-dependent costimulation and directive negative signaling
 5 through the CTLA4 cytoplasmic tail. For a review of CTLA4 structure and
   function, see Teft et al. (2006) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 24:65-97.
                  As mentioned above, a productive immune response requires
   both engagement of TCR and binding of CD28 to CD80 and/or CD86. TCR
   binding in the absence of CD28 binding leads to T cells either undergoing
10 apoptosis or becoming anergic. In addition, CD28 signaling has been shown to
   increase cytokine production by T cells. Specifically, CD28 stimulation has
   been shown to increase production of IL-2, TNFa, lymphotoxin, IFNy and GM
   CSF 5- to 50-fold in activated T cells. Furthermore, induction of lymphokine
   and/or cytokine gene expression by CD28 has been shown to occur even in the
15 presence of the immunosuppressant cyclosporine (Thompson et al. (1989)
   Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 86:1333-1337). CD28 has also been shown to
   promote T cell survival by inducing upregulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL-XL
   (Alegre et al. (2001) Nature Rev. Immunol. 1:220-228).
                  Soluble forms of CTLA4 have been constructed by fusing the
20 variable-like extracellular domain of CTLA4 to immunoglobulin constant
   domains to provide CTLA4-Ig fusion proteins. Soluble CTLA-4-Ig has been
   shown to prevent CD28-dependent costimulation by binding to both CD86 and
   CD80 (Linsley et al. (1991) J. Exp. Med., 174:561-69), and to inhibit
   costimulation of T cells and have beneficial immunosuppression effects in
25 humans (Bruce & Boyce (2007) Ann. Pharmacother. 41:1153-1162). The
   CTLA4-Ig fusion protein abatacept is currently employed for the treatment of
   rheumatoid arthritis in cases of inadequate response to anti-TNFa therapy.
   However, not all patients respond to CTLA4-lg and continued response
   requires frequent drug administration, perhaps in part because blockage of
30 interaction of CD28 with CD86/CD80 is a weak inducer of Tregs and insufficient
   for blocking activated effector T cell responses in a disease milieu.

10 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
                   The present disclosure makes possible the targeting of antigen
   presenting cells (APCs) to alter activity. For example, T-cell activity can be
   modulated by providing multi-specific xceptor fusion proteins that comprise a
   first binding domain that preferentially binds a CD86, and a second binding
15 domain (a heterologous binding domain). In certain embodiments, a multi
   specific xceptor fusion protein comprises a first and second binding domain, a
   first and second linker, and an intervening domain, wherein one end of the
   intervening domain is fused via a linker to the first binding domain that is a
   CD86 binding domain and the other end is fused via a linker to the second
20 binding domain that is an IL-10 agonist, an HLA-G agonist, an HGF agonist, an
   IL-35 agonist, a PD-1 agonist, a BTLA agonist, a LIGHT antagonist, a GITRL
   antagonist or a CD40 antagonist.
                   In certain embodiments, the CD86 binding domain is a CTLA4
   ectodomain, a CD28 ectodomain, or an immunoglobulin variable region binding
25 domain (such as a scFv) specific for CD86 (e.g., from monoclonal antibodies
   3D1 or FUN1). In some embodiments, less than an entire ectodomain is used.
   For example, domains within the CTLA4 ectodomain that bind CD86 and
   prevent binding of CD86 to CD28 can be used. In further embodiments, the
   IL10 agonist is IL10 or a functional region thereof. In further embodiments, the
30 HLA-G agonist is an HLA-G5, an HLA-G1, an HLA-G mutein, or a functional
   region thereof; an ectodomain of an HLA-G5, an HLA-G1 or an HLA-G mutein;
   or an immunoglobulin variable region binding domain (such as a scFv) specific
   for ILT2, ILT4 or KIR2DL4. In still further embodiments, the heterologous
   binding domain is an HGF agonist, such as an HGF or a sub-domain thereof.
35 In another embodiment, the heterologous binding domain is an IL35 agonist,
                                             5

   such as an immunoglobulin variable region binding domain (such as a scFv)
   specific for IL35R or IL35, or a functional region thereof. In further
   embodiments, the LIGHT antagonist is an immunoglobulin variable region
   binding domain (such as a scFv) specific for LIGHT, or a HVEM ectodomain or
 5 a functional region thereof. In further embodiments, the PD-1 agonist is an
   immunoglobulin variable region binding domain (such as a scFv) specific for
   PD-1, or a PD-1 ligand (e.g. PD-L1 or PD-L2) or a functional region thereof. In
   further embodiments, the BTLA agonist is an immunoglobulin-like variable
   region binding domain (such as a scFv) specific for BTLA, or a HVEM
10 ectodomain or a functional region thereof. In certain embodiments, the GITRL
   antagonist is an immunoglobulin-like variable region binding domain (such as a
   scFv) specific for GITRL, or a GITR ectodomain, soluble GITR, or a functional
   region thereof. In certain embodiments, the CD40 antagonist is an
   immunoglobulin-like variable region binding domain (such as a scFv) specific
15 for CD40.
                  Exemplary structures of such multi-specific fusion proteins,
   referred to herein as Xceptor molecules, include N-BD-ID-ED-C, N-ED-ID-BD
   C, N-BD1-ID-BD2-C, and N-ED-ID-ED-C, wherein N- and -C refer to the
   amino- and carboxy terminus, respectively; BD is an immunoglobulin-like or
20 immunoglobulin variable region binding domain; ID is an intervening domain;
   and ED is an extracellular or ectodomain, such as a receptor ligand binding
   domain, ligand, C-type lectin domain, semaphorin or semaphorin-like domain,
   or the like. In some constructs, the ID can comprise an immunoglobulin
   constant region or sub-region disposed between the first and second binding
25 domains. In still further constructs, the BD and ED are each linked to the ID via
   the same or different linker (e.g., a linker comprising one to 50 amino acids),
   such as an immunoglobulin hinge region (made up of, for example, the upper
   and core regions) or functional variant thereof, or a lectin interdomain region or
   functional variant thereof, or a cluster of differentiation (CD) molecule stalk
30 region or functional variant thereof.
                  Prior to setting forth this disclosure in more detail, it may be
   helpful to an understanding thereof to provide definitions of certain terms to be
   used herein. Additional definitions are set forth throughout this disclosure.
                  In the present description, any concentration range, percentage
35 range, ratio range, or integer range is to be understood to include the value of
   any integer within the recited range and, when appropriate, fractions thereof
                                               6

   (such as one tenth and one hundredth of an integer), unless otherwise
   indicated. Also, any number range recited herein relating to any physical
   feature, such as polymer subunits, size or thickness, are to be understood to
   include any integer within the recited range, unless otherwise indicated. As
 5 used herein, "about" or "consisting essentially of' mean ± 20% of the indicated
   range, value, or structure, unless otherwise indicated. It should be understood
   that the terms "a" and "an" as used herein refer to "one or more" of the
   enumerated components. The use of the alternative (e.g., "or") should be
   understood to mean either one, both, or any combination thereof of the
10 alternatives. As used herein, the terms "include" and "comprise" are used
   synonymously. In addition, it should be understood that the individual
   compounds, or groups of compounds, derived from the various combinations of
   the structures and substituents described herein, are disclosed by the present
   application to the same extent as if each compound or group of compounds
15 was set forth individually. Thus, selection of particular structures or particular
   substituents is within the scope of the present disclosure.
                  A "binding domain" or "binding region" according to the present
   disclosure may be, for example, any protein, polypeptide, oligopeptide, or
   peptide that possesses the ability to specifically recognize and bind to a
20 biological molecule (e.g., CD86) or a complex of more than one of the same or
   different molecule or assembly or aggregate, whether stable or transient (e.g.
   CD86/CD28 complex). Such biological molecules include proteins,
   polypeptides, oligopeptides, peptides, amino acids, or derivatives thereof, lipids,
   fatty acids, or derivatives thereof; carbohydrates, saccharides, or derivatives
25 thereof; nucleotides, nucleosides, peptide nucleic acids, nucleic acid molecules,
   or derivatives thereof; glycoproteins, glycopeptides, glycolipids, lipoproteins,
   proteolipids, or derivatives thereof; other biological molecules that may be
   present in, for example, a biological sample; or any combination thereof. A
   binding region includes any naturally occurring, synthetic, semi-synthetic, or
30 recombinantly produced binding partner for a biological molecule or other target
   of interest. A variety of assays are known for identifying binding domains of the
   present disclosure that specifically bind with a particular target, including FACS,
   Western blot, ELISA, or Biacore analysis.
                  Binding domains and fusion proteins thereof of this disclosure can
35 be capable of binding to a desired degree, including "specifically or selectively
   binding" a target while not significantly binding other components present in a
                                             7

   test sample, if they bind a target molecule with an affinity or Ka (i.e., an
   equilibrium association constant of a particular binding interaction with units of
    1/M) of, for example, greater than or equal to about 105 M-1 , 106 M- 1 , 107 M-1,
    108 M-1 , 109 M- 1, 1010 M- 1 , 101 M-1 , 1012 M-1 , or 1013 M-1 . "High affinity" binding
 5 domains refers to those binding domains with a Ka of at least 10 7 M-1 , at least
    108 M-1 , at least 109 M-1 , at least 1010 M-1 , at least 1011 M-, at least 1012 M-1 , at
   least 1013 M-1 , or greater. Alternatively, affinity may be defined as an
   equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of a particular binding interaction with
   units of M (e.g., 10-5 M to 1013 M). Affinities of binding domain polypeptides
10 and fusion proteins according to the present disclosure can be readily
   determined using conventional techniques (see, e.g., Scatchard et al. (1949)
   Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 51:660; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,283,173; 5,468,614, or the
   equivalent).
                    Binding domains of this disclosure can be generated as described
15 herein or by a variety of methods known in the art (see, e.g., US Patent Nos.
   6,291,161; 6,291,158). Sources include antibody gene sequences from various
   species (which can be formatted as antibodies, sFvs, scFvs or Fabs, such as in
   a phage library), including human, camelid (from camels, dromedaries, or
    llamas; Hamers-Casterman et al. (1993) Nature, 363:446 and Nguyen et al.
20 (1998) J. Mol. Biol., 275:413), shark (Roux et al. (1998) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci.
   (USA) 95:11804), fish (Nguyen et al. (2002) Immunogenetics, 54:39), rodent,
   avian, ovine, sequences that encode random peptide libraries or sequences
   that encode an engineered diversity of amino acids in loop regions of
   alternative non-antibody scaffolds, such as fibrinogen domains (see, e.g.,
25 Weisel et al. (1985) Science 230:1388), Kunitz domains (see, e.g., US Patent
    No. 6,423,498), lipocalin domains (see, e.g., WO 2006/095164), V-like domains
   (see, e.g., US Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0065431), C-type lectin
   domains (Zelensky and Gready (2005) FEBS J. 272:6179), mAb 2 or Fcab T M
   (see, e.g., PCT Patent Application Publication Nos. WO 2007/098934; WO
30 2006/072620), or the like. Additionally, traditional strategies for hybridoma
   development using, for example, a synthetic single chain CD86 as an
   immunogen in convenient systems (e.g., mice, HuMAb mouse@, TC mouseTM
   KM-mouse@, llamas, chicken, rats, hamsters, rabbits, etc.) can be used to
   develop binding domains of this disclosure.
35                  Terms understood by those in the art as referring to antibody
   technology are each given the meaning acquired in the art, unless expressly
                                                  8

   defined herein. For example, the terms "VL" and "VH" refer to the variable
   binding region derived from an antibody light and heavy chain, respectively.
   The variable binding regions are made up of discrete, well-defined sub-regions
   known as "complementarity determining regions" (CDRs) and "framework
 5 regions" (FRs). The terms "CL" and "CH" refer to an "immunoglobulin constant
   region," i.e., a constant region derived from an antibody light or heavy chain,
   respectively, with the latter region understood to be further divisible into CH1,
   CH2, CH3  and CH4 constant region domains, depending on the antibody isotype
   (IgA, igD, IgE, IgG, IgM) from which the region was derived. A portion of the
10 constant region domains makes up the Fc region (the "fragment crystallizable"
   region), which contains domains responsible for the effector functions of an
   immunoglobulin, such as ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated
   cytotoxicity), CDC (complement-dependent cytotoxicity) and complement
   fixation, binding to Fc receptors, greater half-life in vivo relative to a polypeptide
15 lacking an Fc region, protein A binding, and perhaps even placental transfer
   (see Capon et al. (1989) Nature, 337:525). Further, a polypeptide containing
   an Fc region allows for dimerization or multimerization of the polypeptide. A
   "hinge region," also referred to herein as a "linker," is an amino acid sequence
   interposed between and connecting the variable binding and constant regions
20 of a single chain of an antibody, which is known in the art as providing flexibility
   in the form of a hinge to antibodies or antibody-like molecules.
                   The domain structure of immunoglobulins is amenable to
   engineering, in that the antigen binding domains and the domains conferring
   effector functions may be exchanged between immunoglobulin classes and
25 subclasses. Immunoglobulin structure and function are reviewed, for example,

                    "Derivative" as used herein refers to a chemically or biologically
   modified version of a compound that is structurally similar to a parent
   compound and (actually or theoretically) derivable from that parent compound.
   Generally, a "derivative" differs from an "analogue" in that a parent compound
 5 may be the starting material to generate a "derivative," whereas the parent
   compound may not necessarily be used as the starting material to generate an
   "analogue." An analogue may have different chemical or physical properties of
   the parent compound. For example, a derivative may be more hydrophilic or it
   may have altered reactivity (e.g., a CDR having an amino acid change that
10 alters its affinity for a target) as compared to the parent compound.
                    The term "biological sample" includes a blood sample, biopsy
   specimen, tissue explant, organ culture, biological fluid (e.g., serum, urine,
   CSF) or any other tissue or cell or other preparation from a subject or a
   biological source. A subject or biological source may, for example, be a human
15 or non-human animal, a primary cell culture or culture adapted cell line
   including genetically engineered cell lines that may contain chromosomally
   integrated or episomal recombinant nucleic acid sequences, somatic cell hybrid
   cell lines, immortalized or immortalizable cell lines, differentiated or
   differentiatable cell lines, transformed cell lines, or the like. In further
20 embodiments of this disclosure, a subject or biological source may be
   suspected of having or being at risk for having a disease, disorder or condition,
   including a malignant disease, disorder or condition or a B cell disorder. In
   certain embodiments, a subject or biological source may be suspected of
   having or being at risk for having a hyperproliferative, inflammatory, or
25 autoimmune disease, and in certain other embodiments of this disclosure the
   subject or biological source may be known to be free of a risk or presence of
   such disease, disorder, or condition.
   CD86 Binding Domains
                    As set forth herein, CD86 comprises a type I membrane protein
30 that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. CD86 is expressed by
   antigen-presenting cells, and is the ligand for the two T-cell proteins CD28 and
   CTLA4. Binding of CD28 with CD28 is a costimulatory signal for activation of
   the T-cell, while binding of CD28 with CTLA4 downregulates T-cell activation
   and reduces the immune response. Alternative splicing results in two transcript
                                              10

   variants encoding different isoforms (Genbank Accessions NP_787058.3 and
   NP_008820.2).
                  A CD86 binding domain of this disclosure can block binding of
   CD86 to CD28 and thereby downregulate T-cell activation. CD86 binding
 5 domains contemplated include a CTLA4 extracellular domain, or sub-domain
   thereof, a CD28 extracellular domain or sub-domain, or a CD86-specific
   antibody-derived binding domain (such as derived from the FUN1 monoclonal
   antibody (see e.g., J Pathol. 1993 Mar;169(3):309-15); or derived from the 3D1
   anti-CD86 monoclonal antibody.
10                In some embodiments, a CD86 binding domain is an extracellular
   domain ("ectodomain") of a human CTLA4 (Genbank Accession NP_005205),
   such as the mature polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 (signal peptide:
   amino acids 1-37). The amino acid sequence of the CTLA4 ectodomain without
   the signal peptide is provided in SEQ ID NO: 410. Applicants note that certain
15 studies have indicated that the mature polypeptide of the CTLA4 ectodomain
   begins at the methionine at position 38 of SEQ ID NO: 1, other studies have
   indicated that the mature polypeptide begins at the alanine at position 37. In
   further embodiments, a CD86 binding domain is an ectodomain of CTLA4 that
   has been mutated in order to have a higher avidity for CD86 than wildtype, or
20 non-mutated, CTLA4 as disclosed, for example, in US Patent Publication No.
   US 2003/0035816. In certain embodiments, the mutated CTLA4 ectodomain
   comprises an alanine or tyrosine at amino acid position 29, and/or a glutamic
   acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine or threonine at
   position 104 of SEQ ID NO:41 0. The amino acid sequence for the A29Y Li 04E
25 CTLA 4 ectodomain variant is provided in SEQ ID NO:41 1. In certain
   embodiments, a CD86 binding domain is a CTLA-4 variable-like domain, such
   as the sequence provided in SEQ ID NO:3, or a CDR of a CTLA-4 variable-like
   domain, such as SEQ ID NO: 4 (CDR1), SEQ ID NO:5, (CDR2) or SEQ ID
   NO:6 (CDR3). Such CDRs are described, for example, in US Patent
30 7,405,288. In alternative embodiments, a CD86 binding domain is an
   extracellular domain ("ectodomain") of a CD28 (Genbank Accession
   NP_006130.1), such as the sequence provided in SEQ ID NO:2. Amino acids
   1-18 of SEQ ID NO:2 are the signal peptide. The amino acid sequence of the
   ectodomain of CD28 without the signal peptide is provided in SEQ ID NO:412.
35                In yet further embodiments, a CD86 binding domain comprises a
   single chain immunoglobulin-like domain, such as a scFv, that is specific for
                                           11

   CD86. In certain embodiments, the CD86 binding domain contains the light
   and heavy variable binding domains from monoclonal antibody FUN1 or 3D1.
   The sequences for the heavy chain, light chain, scFv linker, and CDRs from the
    FUN1 and 3D1 anti-CD86 monoclonal antibodies are set forth in SEQ
 5  NOS:305-313 and 318-326, respectively, which can be used in the xceptor
    molecules of the instant disclosure.
                   In one aspect, a CD86 binding domain or fusion protein thereof of
   this disclosure is specific for CD86 and has an affinity with a dissociation
   constant (Kd) of about 10-3 M to less than about 10-8 M. In certain preferred
10 embodiments, the CD86 binding domain or fusion protein thereof binds CD86
   with an affinity of about 0.3 pM.
                   In an illustrative example, CD86 binding domains of this
   disclosure can be identified using a Fab phage library of fragments (see, e.g.,
    Hoet et al. (2005) Nature Biotechnol. 23:344) by screening for binding to a
15 synthetic or recombinant CD86 (using an amino acid sequence or fragment
   thereof as set forth in GenBank Accession No. NP_787058.3 or NP_008820.2).
    In certain embodiments, a CD86 molecule used to generate a CD86 binding
   domain can further comprise an intervening domain or a dimerization domain,
   as described herein, such as an immunoglobulin Fc domain or fragment
20 thereof.
                   In some embodiments, CD86 binding domains of this disclosure
   comprise VH and VL domains as described herein (e.g., FUN1, 3D1, or
   humanized derivatives thereof). Other exemplary VH and VL domains include
   those described in US Patent 6,827,934. In certain embodiments, the VH and
25 VL domains are human. In further embodiments, there are provided CD86
   binding domains of this disclosure that have a sequence that is at least 90%, at
   least 91 %, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%,
   at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, at least 99.5%, or at least 100%
   identical to the amino acid sequence of one or more light chain variable regions
30 (VL) or to one or more heavy chain variable regions (VH), or both, of SEQ
   NOS:305 and 306, SEQ NOS:318 and 319, or those disclosed in US Patent
   6,827,934 (incorporated herein by reference), wherein each CDR can have
   zero, one, two,or three amino acid changes (i.e., most changes are in the
   framework region(s)).
35                The terms "identical" or "percent identity," in the context of two or
   more polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule sequences, means two or more
                                              12

   sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage
   of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same over a specified region
   (e.g., 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%,
   96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identity), when compared and aligned for
 5 maximum correspondence over a comparison window, or designated region, as
   measured using methods known in the art, such as a sequence comparison
   algorithm, by manual alignment, or by visual inspection. For example, preferred
   algorithms suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence
   similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in
10 Altschul et al. (1977) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389 and Altschul et al. (1990) J.
   Mol. Biol. 215:403, respectively.
                   In any of these or other embodiments described herein where VL
   and VH domains may be desired, the VL and VH domains may be arranged in
   either orientation and may be separated by up to about a 30 amino acid linker
15 as disclosed herein or any amino acid sequence capable of providing a spacer
   function compatible with interaction of the two sub-binding domains. In certain
   embodiments, a linker joining the VH and VL domains comprises an amino acid
   sequence as set forth in any one or more of SEQ ID NOS: 43-166, 244, 307,
   320, 355-379 and 383-398, such as Linker 46 (SEQ ID NO:88), Linker 130
20 (SEQ ID NO:163), Linker 131 (SEQ ID NO:164), Linker 115 (SEQ ID NO:148),
   or the linker provided in SEQ ID NO:244. Multi-specific binding domains will
   have at least two specific sub-binding domains, by analogy to camelid antibody
   organization, or at least four specific sub-binding domains, by analogy to the
   more conventional mammalian antibody organization of paired VH and VL
25 chains.
                   CDRs are defined in various ways in the art, including the Kabat,
   Chothia, AbM, and contact definitions. The Kabat definition is based on
   sequence variability and is the most commonly used definition to predict CDR
   regions (Johnson et al. (2000) Nucleic Acids Res. 28:214). The Chothia
30 definition is based on the location of the structural loop regions (Chothia et al.
   (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901; Chothia et al. (1989) Nature 342:877). The AbM
   definition, a compromise between the Kabat and Chothia definitions, is an
   integral suite of programs for antibody structure modeling produced by the
   Oxford Molecular Group (Martin et al. (1989) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. (USA)
35 86:9268; Rees et al., ABMTM, a computer program for modeling variable
   regions of antibodies, Oxford, UK; Oxford Molecular, Ltd.). An additional
                                             13

   definition, known as the contact definition, has been recently introduced (see
   MacCallum et al. (1996) J. Mol. Biol. 5:732), which is based on analysis of
   available complex crystal structures.
                  By convention, the CDR domains in the heavy chain are referred
 5 to as H1, H2, and H3, which are numbered sequentially in order moving from
   the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus. The CDR-H1 is about ten to 12
   residues in length and starts four residues after a Cys according to the Chothia
   and AbM definitions, or five residues later according to the Kabat definition.
   The H1 can be followed by a Trp, Trp-Val, Trp-lle, or Trp-Ala. The length of H1
10 is approximately ten to 12 residues according to the AbM definition, while the
   Chothia definition excludes the last four residues. The CDR-H2 starts 15
   residues after the end of H1 according to the Kabat and AbM definitions, which
   is generally preceded by sequence Leu-Glu-Trp-Ile-Gly (but a number of
   variations are known) and is generally followed by sequence Lys/Arg
15 Leu/lle/Val/Phe/Thr/Ala-Thr/Ser/le/Ala. According to the Kabat definition, the
   length of H2 is about 16 to 19 residues, while the AbM definition predicts the
   length to be nine to 12 residues. The CDR-H3 usually starts 33 residues after
   the end of H2, is generally preceded by the amino acid sequence Cys-Ala-Arg
   and followed by the amino acid Gly, and has a length that ranges from three to
20 about 25 residues.
                  By convention, CDR regions in the light chain are referred to as
   L1, L2, and L3, which are numbered sequentially in order moving from the
   amino terminus to the carboxy terminus. The CDR-L1 (approximately ten to 17
   residues in length) generally starts at about residue 24 and generally follows a
25 Cys. The residue after the CDR-L1 is always Trp, which begins one of the
   following sequences: Trp-Tyr-Gln, Trp-Leu-Gln, Trp-Phe-Gln, or Trp-Tyr-Leu.
   The CDR-L2 (about seven residues in length) starts about 16 residues after the
   end of LI and will generally follow residues Ile-Tyr, Val-Tyr, Ile-Lys, or Ile-Phe.
   The CDR-L3 usually starts 33 residues after the end of L2 and generally follows
30 a Cys, which is generally followed by the sequence Phe-Gly-XXX-Gly and has a
   length of about seven to 11 residues.
                  Thus, a binding domain of this disclosure can comprise a single
   CDR from a variable region of an anti-CD86 antibody, or it can comprise
   multiple CDRs that can be the same or different. In certain embodiments,
35 binding domains of this disclosure comprise VH and VL domains specific for a
   CD86 comprising framework regions and CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 regions,
                                            14

   wherein (a) the VH domain comprises an amino acid sequence of a heavy chain
   CDR3; or (b) the VL domain comprises an amino acid sequence of a light chain
   CDR3; or (c) the binding domain comprises a VH amino acid sequence of (a)
   and a VL amino acid sequence of (b); or the binding domain comprises a VH
 5 amino acid sequence of (a) and a VL amino acid sequence of (b) and wherein
   the VH and VL are found in the same reference sequence. In further
   embodiments, binding domains of this disclosure comprise VH and VL domains
   specific for an CD86 comprising framework regions and CDR1, CDR2 and
   CDR3 regions, wherein (a) the VH domain comprises an amino acid sequence
10 of a heavy chain CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3; or (b) the VL domain comprises an
   amino acid sequence of a light chain CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3; or (c) the
    binding domain comprises a VH amino acid sequence of (a) and a VL amino
   acid sequence of (b); or the binding domain comprises a VH amino acid
   sequence of (a) and a VL amino acid sequence of (b), wherein the VH and VL
15 amino acid sequences are from the same reference sequence.
                    In any of the embodiments described herein comprising specific
   CDRs, a binding domain can comprise (i) a VH domain having an amino acid
   sequence that is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%,
   97%, 98%, or 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of a VH domain; or (ii) a
20 VL domain having an amino acid sequence that is at least 80%, 85%, 90%,
   91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to the amino
   acid sequence of a VL domain; or (iii) both a VH domain of (i) and a VL domain
   of (ii); or both a VH domain of (i) and a VL domain of (ii) wherein the VH and VL
   are from the same reference sequence, wherein each CDR has up to three
25 amino acid changes (i.e., many of the changes are in the framework region(s)).
                   A CD86 binding domain in xceptor fusion proteins of this
   disclosure may be an immunoglobulin-like domain, such as an immunoglobulin
   scaffold. Immunoglobulin scaffolds contemplated by this disclosure include a
   scFv, a domain antibody, or a heavy chain-only antibody. In a scFv, this
30 disclosure contemplates the heavy and light chain variable regions are joined
    by any linker peptide described herein or known in the art to be compatible with
   joining domains or regions in a binding molecule. Exemplary linkers are linkers
    based on the Gly 4Ser linker motif, such as (Gly 4 Ser)n, where n=1-5. If a binding
   domain of a fusion protein of this disclosure is based on a non-human
35 immunoglobulin or includes non-human CDRs, the binding domain may be
   "humanized" according to methods known in the art.
                                             15

                  Alternatively, a CD86 binding domain of fusion proteins of this
   disclosure may be a scaffold other than an immunoglobulin scaffold. Other
   scaffolds contemplated by this disclosure present the CD86-specific CDR(s) in
   a functional conformation. Other scaffolds contemplated include, but are not
 5 limited an A domain molecule, a fibronectin Ill domain, an anticalin, an ankyrin
   repeat engineered binding molecule, an adnectin, a Kunitz domain or a protein
   AZ domain affibody.
   IL10
                  As noted above, in certain embodiments the present disclosure
10 provides polypeptides containing a binding region or domain that is an IL1 0
   agonist (i.e., can increase IL10 signaling). In some embodiments, the IL10
   agonist binding domain is an IL1 0 or a IL1 OFc, or a functional sub-domain
   thereof. In other embodiments, the IL10 agonist binding domain is a single
   chain binding protein, such as an scFv, that specifically binds to IL10R1 or
15 IL10R2. In some embodiments, the IL10 agonist binding domain is an IL10
   containing a point mutation at position 87 of SEQ ID NO:7, such as from "I"to
   "A" or "S" (referred to herein as 187A or 187S, respectively). The 187 variant
   IL1 0 molecules are known to be less immuno-stimulatory compared to wildtype
   IL10 (Ding et al., J. Exp. Med. 191:213, 2000). Additionally, IL10 normally
20 forms a homodimer with the amino terminal domain of each monomer molecule
   binding to the carboxy terminal domain of the other monomer). In one
   embodiment, the IL10 agonist binding domain is an IL10 molecule having a
   short linker (gggsgg SEQ ID NO:379) that separates the two subdomains of the
   molecule (amino and carboxy end domains) so that these subdomains can form
25 an intramolecular dimer was also examined. These are referred to herein as
   monolL10 molecules.
                   IL10 (Genbank Accession no. NP_000563.1; SEQ ID NO:7) is a
   member of a cytokine superfamily that share an alpha-helical structure. Amino
   acids 1-18 of SEQ ID NO:7 are the signal peptide of the precursor IL1 0 protein.
30 The amino acid sequence of the mature IL10 protein is provided in SEQ ID
   NO:418. Although no empirical evidence exists, it has been suggested that all
   the family members possess six alpha-helices (Fickenscher, H. et al., (2002)
   Trends Immunol. 23: 89). IL1 0 has four cysteines, only one of which is
   conserved among family members. Since IL10 demonstrates a V-shaped fold
35 that contributes to its dimerization, it appears that disulfide bonds are not critical
                                              16

    to this structure. Amino acid identity of family members to IL10 ranges from
    20% (IL-19) to 28% (IL-20) (Dumouter et al., (2002) Eur. Cytokine Netw. 13:5).
                    ILl0 was first described as a Th2 cytokine in mice that inhibited
    IFN-a and GM-CSF cytokine production by Th1 cells (Moore et al., 2001, Annu.
 5  Rev. Immunol. 19:683; Fiorentino et at., (1989) J. Exp. Med. 170: 2081).
    Human IL10 is 178 amino acids in length with an 18 amino acid signal
    sequence and a 160 amino acid mature segment. Its molecular weight is
    approximately 18 kDa (monomer). Human IL10 contains no potential N-linked
    glycosylation site and is not glycosylated (Dumouter et al., (2002) Eur. Cytokine
10  Netw. 13:5; Vieira et al., (1991) Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 88:1172). It
    contains four cysteine residues that form two intrachain disulfide bonds.
    Helices A --> D of one monomer noncovalently interact with helices E and F of
    a second monomer, forming a noncovalent V-shaped homodimer. Functional
    areas have been mapped on the IL10 molecule. In the N-terminus, pre-helix A
15  residues #1-9 are involved in mast cell proliferation, while in the C-terminus,
    helix F residues #152-160 mediate leukocyte secretion and chemotaxis.
                   Cells known to express IL10 include CD8+ T cells, microglia,
    CD14+ (but not CD16+) monocytes, Th2 CD4+ cells (mice), keratinocytes,
    hepatic stellate cells, Th1 and Th2 CD4+ T cells (human), melanoma cells,
20 activated macrophages, NK cells, dendritic cells, B cells (CD5+ and CD19+)
   and eosinophils. On T cells, the initial observation of IL10 inhibition of IFN
   gamma production is now suggested to be an indirect effect mediated by
   accessory cells. Additional effects on T cells, however, include: IL10 induced
   CD8+ T cell chemotaxis, an inhibition of CD4+ T cell chemotaxis towards IL-8,
25 suppression of IL-2 production following activation, an inhibition of T cell
   apoptosis via Bcl-2 up-regulation, and an interruption of T cell proliferation
   following low antigen exposure accompanied by CD28 costimulation (Akdis et
   al., (2001) Immunology 103:131).
                   On B cells, IL1 0 has a number of related, yet distinct functions. In
30 conjunction with TNF-p and CD40L, IL10 induces IgA production in naive
   (IgD+) B cells. It is believed that TGF-P/CD40L promotes class switching while
   IL10 initiates differentiation and growth. When TGF-p is not present, IL10
   cooperates with CD40L in inducing IgG1 and IgG3 (human), and thus may be a
   direct switch factor for IgG subtypes. Interestingly, IL10 has divergent effects
35 on IL-4 induced IgE secretion. If IL10 is present at the time of IL-4 induced
   class switching, it reverses the effect; if it is present after IgE commitment, it
                                             17

   augments IgE secretion. Finally, CD27/CD70 interaction in the presence of
   IL10 promotes plasma cell formation from memory B cells (Agematsu et al.,
   (1998) Blood 91: 173).
                   Mast cells and NK cells are also impacted by IL10. On mast cells,
 5 IL10 induces histamine release while blocking GM-CSF and TNF-a release.
   This effect may be autocrine as IL10 is known to be released by mast cells in
   rat. As evidence of its pleiotrophic nature, IL10 has the opposite effects on NK
   cells. Rather than blocking TNF-a and GM-CSF production, IL10 actually
   promotes this function on NK cells. In addition, it potentiates IL-2 induced NK
10 cell proliferation and facilitates IFN-y secretion in NK cells primed by IL-18. In
   concert with both IL-12 and/or IL-18, IL10 potentiates NK cell cytotoxicity (Cai et
   al., 1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29: 2658).
                   IL10 has a pronounced anti-inflammatory impact on neutrophils.
   It inhibits the secretion of the chemokines MIP-1 a, MIP-1 P and IL-8, and blocks
15 production of the proinflammatory mediators IL-1P and TNF-a. In addition, it
   decreases the ability of neutrophils to produce superoxide, and as a result
   interferes with PMN-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. It also
   blocks IL-8 and fMLP-induced chemotaxis, possibly via CXCR1 (Vicioso et al.,
   (1998) Eur. Cytokine Netw. 9:247).
20                 On dendritic cells (DCs), IL10 generally exhibits
   immunosuppressive effects. It would appear to promote CD14+ macrophage
   differentiation at the expense of DCs. IL10 seems to decrease the ability of
   DCs to stimulate T cells, particularly for Th1 type cells. Relative to MHC-II
   expression, it can be down-regulated, unchanged, or up-regulated (Sharma et
25 al., (1999) J. Immunol. 163:5020). With respect to CD80 and CD86, IL10 will
   either up-regulate or down-regulate its expression. B7-2/CD86 plays a key role
   in T cell activation. For this molecule, IL10 is involved in both up-regulation and
   down-regulation. Perhaps the most significant modulation, however, occurs
   with CD40 (IL10 seems to reduce its expression). At the regional level, IL10
30 may block immunostimulation by inhibiting Langerhans cell migration in
   response to proinflammatory cytokines. Alternatively, IL10 blocks an
   inflammation-induced DC maturation step that normally involves CCRI, CCR2
   and CCR5 down-regulation and CCR7 up-regulation. This blockage, with
   retention of CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, results in a failure of DCs to migrate to
35 regional nodes. The result is an immobile DC that will not stimulate T cells but
                                             18

   will bind (and clear) proinflammatory chemokines without responding to them
   (D-Amico et al., (2000) Nat. Immunol. 1:387).
                   On monocytes, IL1 0 has a number of documented effects. For
   example, IL10 seems to clearly reduce cell surface MHC-1l expression. It also
 5 inhibits IL-12 production following stimulation. While it promotes a monocyte to
   macrophage transition in conjunction with M-CSF, the phenotype of the
   macrophage is not clear (i.e. CD1 6+/cytotoxic vs. CD1 6-). IL1 0 also reduces
   monocyte GM-CSF secretion and IL-8 production, while promoting IL-1ra
   release (Gesser et al., (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:14620).
10 Hyaluronectin, a connective tissue component, is now known to be secreted by
   monocytes in response to IL10. This may have some importance in cell
   migration, particularly tumor cell metastases, where hyaluronectin is known to
   interrupt cell migration through extracellular space (Gesser et al., (1997) Proc.
   Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 94:14620).
15                 Fusion proteins of IL10 with either murine or macaque Fc regions
   (referred to as IL10Fc) have been shown to inhibit macrophage function and
   prolong pancreatic islet xenograft survival (Feng et al. (1999) Transplantation
   68:1775; Asiedu et al. (2007) Cytokine 40:183), as well as reduce septic shock
   in a murine model (Zheng et al. (1995) J. Immunol. 154:5590).
20                 Human IL10R1 is a 90-110 kDa, single-pass type I
   transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed on a limited number of cell types
   (Liu et al., 1994, J. Immunol. 152: 1821). Weak expression being seen in
   pancreas, skeletal muscle, brain, heart, and kidney. Placenta, lung, and liver
   showed intermediate levels. Monocytes, B-cells, large granular lymphocytes,
25 and T-cells express high levels (Liu et al., 1994, J. Immunol. 152: 1821). The
   expressed protein is a 578 amino acid protein that contains a 21 amino acid
   signal peptide, a 215 amino acid extracellular region, a 25 amino acid
   transmembrane segment, and a 317 amino acid cytoplasmic domain. There
   are two FNIII motifs within the extracellular region and a STAT3 docking site
30 plus a JAK1 association region within the cytoplasmic domain (Kotenko et al.,
   2000 Oncogene 19: 2557; Kotenko et al., 1997, EMBO J. 16: 5894). IL1OR1
   binds human IL10 with a Kd of 200 pM.
                  In some embodiments, binding domains of this disclosure
   comprise VL and VH domains specific for an IL10R1 or IL10R2 as described
35 herein. In certain embodiments, the VL and VH domains are human. The VL
   and VH domains may be arranged in either orientation and may be separated by
                                            19

   up to about a 30 amino acid linker as disclosed herein or any other amino acid
   sequence capable of providing a spacer function compatible with interaction of
   the two sub-binding domains. In certain embodiments, a linker joining the VL
   and VH domains comprises an amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID
 5 NOs:43-166, 244, 307, 320, 355-379 and 383-398, such as the linker provided
   in SEQ ID NO:244, Linker 46 (SEQ ID NO:88), Linker 130 (SEQ ID NO:163), or
   Linker 131 (SEQ ID NO:164). Multi-specific binding domains can have at least
   two specific sub-binding domains, by analogy to camelid antibody organization,
   or at least four specific sub-binding domains, by analogy to the more
10 conventional mammalian antibody organization of paired VL and VH chains. In
   further embodiments, binding domains specific for IL10R1 or IL10R2 of this
   disclosure may comprise one or more complementarity determining region
   ("CDR"), or multiple copies of one or more such CDRs, which have been
   obtained, derived, or designed from variable regions of an anti-IL1OR1 or
15 IL1 0R2 scFv or Fab fragment or from heavy or light chain variable regions
   thereof. Thus, a binding domain of this disclosure can comprise a single CDR
   from a variable region of an anti- IL10R1 or IL10R2, or it can comprise multiple
   CDRs that can be the same or different. In certain embodiments, binding
   domains of this disclosure comprise VL and VH domains specific for an IL1 OR1
20 or IL10R2 comprising framework regions and CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 regions.
   HLA-G
                  As noted above, in certain embodiments the present disclosure
   provides polypeptides containing a binding region or domain that is an HLA-G
   agonist (i.e., can increase HLA-G signaling). In some embodiments, the HLA-G
25 agonist binding domain is an HLA-G1 (SEQ ID NO: 14), an HLA-G5 (SEQ ID
   NO: 15) or an HLA-G mutein in which the cysteine at position of 147 of the
   mature protein has been mutated to an alternative amino acid, for example a
   serine. Amino acids 1-24 and 1-23 of HLA-G1 and HLA-G5, respectively,
   represent the signal peptides. In other embodiments, the HLA-G agonist
30 domain is an ectodomain of HLA-G1 or HLA-G5, either with or without a P-2
   microglobulin attached to the N-terminus by a flexible linker. Examples of such
   linkers include those provided in SEQ ID NOs:43-166, 244, 307, 320, 355-379
   and 383-398 and described below. The preparation of soluble HLA-G1 is
   described in US Patent Publication no. US 2004/0044182.
                                           20

                   In yet other embodiments, the HLA-G agonist binding domain is
   an immunoglobulin variable binding domain, or a derivative thereof (e.g., an
   antibody, Fab, scFv, or the like) that specifically binds to ILT2, ILT4 or
    KIR2DL4. Antibodies that are specific for ILT2, ILT4 or KIR2DL4 include, for
 5 example, those described in US Patent Publication no. US 2003/0232051.
                   Human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) is a nonclassical major
    histocompatability complex (MHC) class I molecule that is a heterodimer
   consisting of a heavy chain and a light chain (beta-2 microglobulin), with the
   heavy chain being anchored in the membrane. HLA-G functions as an
10  immunomodulatory molecule that protects fetal tissues from the maternal
   immune system. .While constitutive expression of HLA-G is limited to fetal
   tissues, adult thymic medulla, cornea, pancreatic islets and erythroid and
   endothelial cell precursors, its expression can be induced in cancers,
   transplantation, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory diseases and viral infections.
15 The HLA-G primary transcript generates seven alternative mRNAs that encode
   the membrane-bound protein isoforms HLA-G1, -G2, -G3 and -G4, and the
   soluble protein isoforms HLA-G5, HLA-G6 and HLA-G7, with HLA-G5 being the
   soluble form of the cell surface-bound HLA-G1 protein.
                  While HLA-G does not seem to have significant immune
20 stimulatory functions, it has been shown to bind to inhibitory receptors, namely
    ILT2, ILT4, KIR2DL4 and CD8, and thereby interact with B-cells, T-cells, NK
   cells and antigen-presenting cells. Dimeric forms of HLA-G have an affinity for
    ILT2 that is several orders of magnitude greater than the affinity for ILT4,
   KIR2DL4 or CD8. HLA-G1 has been shown to inhibit the cytolytic function of
25 uterine and peripheral blood NK cells, the antigen-specific cytolytic function of
   cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the alloproliferative response of CD4+ T-cells, the
   proliferation of T-cells and peripheral blood NK cells, and the maturation and
   function of dendritic cells (see, for example, Wiendl et al. (2003) Blood,
    126:176-185). It has been suggested that HLA-G may be useful in reducing
30 inflammatory responses in the CNS associated with multiple sclerosis (Wiendl
   et al. (2005) Blood, 128:2689-2704), and as a therapeutic agent in promoting
   tolerance to grafts in transplantations (Carosella et al. (2008) Blood 111:4862
   4870).
                   In some embodiments, binding domains of this disclosure
35 comprise VL and VH domains specific for a ILT2, ILT4 or KIR2DL4 as described
   herein. In certain embodiments, the VL and     VH  domains are human. The VL
                                             21

   and VH domains may be arranged in either orientation and may be separated by
   up to about a 30 amino acid linker as disclosed herein or any other amino acid
   sequence capable of providing a spacer function compatible with interaction of
   the two sub-binding domains. In certain embodiments, a linker joining the VL
 5 and VH domains comprises an amino acid sequence as set forth in any one or
   more of SEQ ID NOs:43-166, 244, 307, 320, 355-379 and 383-398, such as
   Linker 115 (SEQ ID NO:148), the linker provided in SEQ ID NO:244, Linker 46
   (SEQ ID NO:88), Linker 130 (SEQ ID NO:163), or Linker 131 (SEQ ID NO:164).
   Multi-specific binding domains can have at least two specific sub-binding
10 domains, by analogy to camelid antibody organization, or at least four specific
   sub-binding domains, by analogy to the more conventional mammalian
   antibody organization of paired VL and VH chains.
                   In further embodiments, binding domains specific for ILT2, ILT4 or
   KIR2DL4 of this disclosure may comprise one or more complementarity
15 determining region ("CDR"), or multiple copies of one or more such CDRs,
   which have been obtained, derived, or designed from variable regions of an
   anti- ILT2, -ILT4 or -KIR2DL4 scFv or Fab fragment or from heavy or light chain
   variable regions thereof. Thus, a binding domain of this disclosure can
   comprise a single CDR from a variable region of an anti- ILT2, -ILT4 or
20 KIR2DL4, or it can comprise multiple CDRs that can be the same or different.
   HGF
                   As noted above, in certain embodiments the present disclosure
   provides polypeptides containing a binding region or domain that is an HGF
   agonist (i.e., can increase HGF signaling). In some embodiments, the HGF
25 agonist binding domain is an HGF or a functional sub-domain thereof.
                   Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) regulates cell growth, cell
   motility, and morphogenesis by activating a tyrosine kinase signaling cascade
   after binding to the proto-oncogenic c-Met receptor. HGF influences a number
   of cell types and regulates various biological activities including cytokine
30 production, cell migration, proliferation and survival. HGF is secreted as a
   single inactive polypeptide and is cleaved by serine proteases into a 69-kDa
   alpha-chain and 34-kDa beta-chain. A disulfide bond between the alpha and
   beta chains produces the active, heterodimeric molecule. Alternative splicing of
   the HGF gene gives rise to five different isoforms (isoforms 1-5; Genbank
35 Accessions nos. NP_000592.3, NP_001010931.1, NP_001010932.1,
                                             22

   NP_001010933.1 and NP_001010934.1, respectively; SEQ ID NOs: 18-22;
   amino acids 1-31 of each of these sequences is the signal peptide).
                  HGF is believed to be a key factor in the prevention and
   attenuation of disease progression (Ito et al. (2008) Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol.
 5 146 Suppl 1:82-87). For example, HGF has been shown to be effective in
   suppressing collagen-induced arthritis in mice (Okunishi et al. (2007) JnI.
   Immunol. 179:5504-5513), and to play a protective role in a mouse model of
   allergic airway inflammation (Okunishi et al. (2005) Jnl. Immunol. 175:4745
   4753; Ito et al. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. (2005) 32:268-280).
10                In some embodiments, binding domains of this disclosure
   comprise VL and VH domains specific for HGF as described herein. In certain
   embodiments, the VL and VH domains are human. The VL and VH domains may
   be arranged in either orientation and may be separated by up to about a 30
   amino acid linker as disclosed herein or any other amino acid sequence
15 capable of providing a spacer function compatible with interaction of the two
   sub-binding domains. In certain embodiments, a linker joining the VL and VH
   domains comprises an amino acid sequence as set forth in any one or more of
   SEQ ID NOs:43-166, 244, 307, 320, 355-379 and 383-398, such as the linker
   provided in SEQ ID NO:244, Linker 46 (SEQ ID NO:88), Linker 130 (SEQ ID
20 NO:163), or Linker 131 (SEQ ID NO:164). Multi-specific binding domains can
   have at least two specific sub-binding domains, by analogy to camelid antibody
   organization, or at least four specific sub-binding domains, by analogy to the
   more conventional mammalian antibody organization of paired VL and VH
   chains. In further embodiments, binding domains specific for HGF of this
25 disclosure may comprise one or more complementarity determining region
   ("CDR"), or multiple copies of one or more such CDRs, which have been
   obtained, derived, or designed from variable regions of an anti-HGF scFv or
   Fab fragment or from heavy or light chain variable regions thereof. Thus, a
   binding domain of this disclosure can comprise a single CDR from a variable
30 region of an anti-HGF, or it can comprise multiple CDRs that can be the same
   or different. In certain embodiments, binding domains of this disclosure
   comprise VL and VH domains specific for an HGF comprising framework regions
   and CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 regions.
                                             23

   IL35
                   As noted above, in certain embodiments the present disclosure
   provides polypeptides containing a binding region or domain that is an IL35
   agonist (i.e., can increase IL35 signaling). In some embodiments, the IL35
 5 agonist binding domain is an IL35 (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 25 and 26) or a functional
   sub-domain thereof. In certain embodiments, the IL35 agonist binding domain
   is a single chain polypeptide comprising the sequences of SEQ ID NO: 25 and
   26, or functional sub-domains thereof. Such single chain polypeptides may
   include one or more linkers, including linkers as described herein. In other
10 embodiments, the IL35 agonist binding domain is a single chain
   immunoglobulin variable domain, such as a scFv, specific for IL35R that has
   IL35 agonist activity.
                   IL-35 is a newly described cytokine of the IL-12 cytokine
   subfamily. The heterodimeric molecule is comprised of the IL-12 p35 and the
15 IL-27 Ebi3 subunits. It has recently been shown to be a potent inducer of Treg
   function and capable of altering a TH17 response in a mouse model of arthritis
   (Niedbala et al. (2007) Eur. J. Immunol. 37:3021; Collison et al. (2007) Nature
   450:566). Therefore, combining IL-35 agonism with CD86 inhibition is predicted
   to increase the therapeutic benefit of CD28 inhibition alone.
20                 Regulatory T-cells (TREGS) are a critical sub-population of CD4+
   T cells that are important for maintaining self tolerance and preventing
   autoimmunity, for limiting chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and
   inflammatory bowel disease, and for regulating homeostatic lymphocyte
   expansion. IL35 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that has been shown to
25 suppress immune responses by stimulating expansion of regulatory T cells and
   suppression of Th1 7 cell development (Collison et al. (2007) Nature 450:566-9).
   IL35 is a heterodimer formed from Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EB13;
   SEQ ID NO: 25; signal peptide: amino acids 1-20) and the p35subunit of IL12
   (SEQ ID NO: 26; signal peptide: amino acids 1-56) (Devergne et al. (1997)
30 Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 94:12041-12046; US Patent 5,830,451; US Patent
   Publication no. US 2007/0299026). It has been shown to have a therapeutic
   effect equivalent to that of EnbrelTM in a murine collagen-induced arthritis model
   (Niedbala et al. (2007) Eur. J. Immunol. 37:3021-3029), and has thus been
   proposed as a therapeutic agent against clinical rheumatoid arthritis.
35                 In some embodiments, binding domains of this disclosure
   comprise VL and VH domains specific for an IL35R as described herein. In
                                            24

   certain embodiments, the VL and VH domains are human. The VL and VH
   domains may be arranged in either orientation and may be separated by up to
   about a 30 amino acid linker as disclosed herein or any other amino acid
   sequence capable of providing a spacer function compatible with interaction of
 5 the two sub-binding domains. In certain embodiments, a linker joining the VL
   and VH domains comprises an amino acid sequence as set forth in any one or
   more of SEQ ID NOs:43-166, 244, 307, 320, 355-379 and 383-398, such as the
   linker provided in SEQ ID NO:244, Linker 46 (SEQ ID NO:88), Linker 130 (SEQ
   ID NO:163), or Linker 131 (SEQ ID NO:164). Multi-specific binding domains
10 can have at least two specific sub-binding domains, by analogy to camelid
   antibody organization, or at least four specific sub-binding domains, by analogy
   to the more conventional mammalian antibody organization of paired VL and VH
   chains. In further embodiments, binding domains specific for IL35R of this
   disclosure may comprise one or more complementarity determining region
15 ("CDR"), or multiple copies of one or more such CDRs, which have been
   obtained, derived, or designed from variable regions of an anti-IL35R scFv or
   Fab fragment or from heavy or light chain variable regions thereof. Thus, a
   binding domain of this disclosure can comprise a single CDR from a variable
   region of an anti-IL35R, or it can comprise multiple CDRs that can be the same
20 or different. In certain embodiments, binding domains of this disclosure
   comprise VL and VH domains specific for an IL-35R comprising framework
   regions and CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 regions.
   LIGHT
                  As noted above, in certain embodiments the present disclosure
25 provides polypeptides containing a binding region or domain that is a LIGHT
   antagonist (i.e., can inhibit LIGHT signaling). In some embodiments, the LIGHT
   antagonist binding domain is an HVEM ectodomain (also referred to as sHVEM;
   SEQ ID NO: 29; signal peptide: amino acids 1-38) or a functional sub-domain
   thereof. In other embodiments, the LIGHT antagonist binding domain is a
30 single chain immunoglobulin-like variable domain, such as a scFv, specific for
   LIGHT. In certain embodiments, the LIGHT antagonist domain is a single chain
   immunoglobulin-like variable domain comprising VH and VL domains as
   described in PCT Patent Publication no. WO 08/027338.
                  LIGHT is a member of the TNF superfamily that is expressed on
35 activated T lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes and immature dendritic
                                            25

   cells. Two distinct isoforms of LIGHT have been reported (Genbank Accession
   nos. NP_003798.2 and NP_742011.1). LIGHT has been shown to regulate T
   cell immune responses by signaling through the herpes virus entry mediator
   (HVEM) and the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTpR). Both HVEM and LTpR bind
 5 LIGHT with high affinity, with expression of HVEM being detected in T cells, B
   cells, natural killer cells and endothelial cells, and LTpR being expressed in
   monocytes and stromal cells but not T cells and B cells. LIGHT has been
   shown to be a co-stimulatory molecule for CD28-independent T cell activation
   and to preferentially induce IFN-y and GM-CSF production. Blockade of LIGHT
10 by in vivo administration of LTpR-Ig fusion protein or anti-LIGHT antibodies
   results in decreased T cell-mediated immune responses and ameliorates graft
   versus-host disease in a murine model (Tamada et al. (2000) Nat. Med. 6:283
   9). Constitutive expression of LIGHT leads to tissue destruction and
   autoimmune-like disease syndromes (Granger & Rickert (2003) Cytokine
15 Growth Factor Rev. 14:289-96).
                  In some embodiments, binding domains of this disclosure
   comprise VL and VH domains specific for LIGHT as described herein. In certain
   embodiments, the VL and VH domains are human. The VL and VH domains may
   be arranged in either orientation and may be separated by up to about a 30
20 amino acid linker as disclosed herein or any other amino acid sequence
   capable of providing a spacer function compatible with interaction of the two
   sub-binding domains. In certain embodiments, a linker joining the VL and VH
   domains comprises an amino acid sequence as set forth in any one or more of
   SEQ ID NOs:43-166, 244, 307, 320, 355-379 and 383-398, such as the linker
25  provided in SEQ ID NO:244, Linker 46 (SEQ ID NO:88), Linker 130 (SEQ ID
    NO:163), or Linker 131 (SEQ ID NO:164). Multi-specific binding domains can
    have at least two specific sub-binding domains, by analogy to camelid antibody
   organization, or at least four specific sub-binding domains, by analogy to the
    more conventional mammalian antibody organization of paired VL and VH
30 chains.
                   In further embodiments, binding domains specific for LIGHT of
   this disclosure may comprise one or more complementarity determining region
    ("CDR"), or multiple copies of one or more such CDRs, which have been
   obtained, derived, or designed from variable regions of an anti-LIGHT scFv or
35  Fab fragment or from heavy or light chain variable regions thereof. Thus, a
    binding domain of this disclosure can comprise a single CDR from a variable
                                              26

   region of an anti-LIGHT, or it can comprise multiple CDRs that can be the same
   or different. In certain embodiments, binding domains of this disclosure
   comprise VL and VH domains specific for a LIGHT comprising framework
   regions and CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 regions.
 5 PD-1
                   As noted above, in certain embodiments the present disclosure
   provides polypeptides containing a binding region or domain that is a PD-1
   agonist (i.e., can increase PD-1 signaling). In some embodiments, the PD-1
   agonist binding domain is a PD1-L1 (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 32; signal peptide: amino
10 acids 1-18), a PD1-L2 (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 33; signal peptide: amino acids 1-19),
   or a functional sub-domain thereof. In other embodiments, the PD-1 agonist
   binding domain is a single chain immunoglobulin-like variable domain, such as
   a scFv, specific for PD-1. Antibodies specific for PD-1 include, for example,
   those described in US Patent Publication No. US 2006/0210567.
15                 PD-1 (Genbank Accession NP_005009.1) is a member of the
   CD28/CTLA4 family that is expressed on activated T cells, B cells and myeloid
   cells. PD-1 contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. PD-1
   functions by binding to programmed death-1 ligand 1 (PD1-L1; also known as
   CD274) and programmed death-1 ligand 2 (PD1-L2). Human PD-L1 and PD
20 L2 are expressed on both immature and mature dendritic cells, IFNy-treated
   monocytes and follicular dendritic cells. Mice deficient in PD-1 show a variety
   of autoimmune pathologies, demonstrating that PD-1 is a negative regulator of
   the immune response (Nishimura & Honjo (2001) Trends Immunol. 2:265;
   Nishimura et al. (1999) Immunity 11:141). Binding of PD-1 to PD1-L1 and PD1
25 L2 has been shown to result in down-regulation of T cell activation (Freeman et
   al. (2000) J. Exp. Med. 192:1027; Latchman et al. (2001) Nat. Immunol. 2:261;
   Carter et al. (2002) Eur. J. Immunol. 32:634).
                   In some embodiments, binding domains of this disclosure
   comprise VL and VH domains specific for a PD-1 as described herein. In certain
30 embodiments, the VL and VH domains are human. The VL and VH domains may
   be arranged in either orientation and may be separated by up to about a 30
   amino acid linker as disclosed herein or any other amino acid sequence
   capable of providing a spacer function compatible with interaction of the two
   sub-binding domains. In certain embodiments, a linker joining the VL and VH
35 domains comprises an amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NOs:43
                                            27

   166, 244, 307, 320, 355-379 and 383-398, such as the linker provided in SEQ
   ID NO:244, Linker 46 (SEQ ID NO:88), Linker 130 (SEQ ID NO:163), or Linker
   131 (SEQ ID NO:164). Multi-specific binding domains can have at least two
   specific sub-binding domains, by analogy to camelid antibody organization, or
 5 at least four specific sub-binding domains, by analogy to the more conventional
   mammalian antibody organization of paired VL and VH chains.
                   In further embodiments, binding domains specific for PD-1 of this
   disclosure may comprise one or more complementarity determining region
   ("CDR"), or multiple copies of one or more such CDRs, which have been
10 obtained, derived, or designed from variable regions of an anti-PD-1 scFv or
   Fab fragment or from heavy or light chain variable regions thereof. Thus, a
   binding domain of this disclosure can comprise a single CDR from a variable
   region of an anti-PD-1, or it can comprise multiple CDRs that can be the same
   or different.
15 BTLA
                  As noted above, in certain embodiments the present disclosure
   provides polypeptides containing a binding region or domain that is a BTLA
   agonist (i.e., can increase BTLA signaling). In some embodiments, the BTLA
   agonist binding domain is a HVEM ectodomain (also referred to as sHVEM;
20 SEQ ID NO: 29; signal peptide: amino acids 1-38) or a functional sub-domain
   thereof (e.g. amino acids 54-78 of SEQ ID NO: 29). In other embodiments, the
   BTLA agonist binding domain is a single chain immunoglobulin-like variable
   domain, such as a scFv, specific for BTLA. Agonist antibodies specific for
   BTLA are described, for example, in Krieg et al. (2005) J. Immunol. 175:6420
25 6472.
                   BTLA (Genbank Accession nos. NP_001078826.1 and
   NP_861445.3; isoforms 2 and 1, respectively) is a cell surface protein that is a
   member of the immunoglobulin family and is expressed on B-cells, T-cells and
   antigen presenting cells. The ligand for BTLA is herpes virus entry mediator
30 (HVEM), which is a member of the tumor-necrosis factor receptor family and
   also acts as a ligand for LIGHT (Sedy et al. (2005) Nat. Immunol. 6:90-98). A
   binding site for BTLA has been identified in CRD1 of HVEM (amino acids 54-78
   of SEQ ID NO: 29; PCT Patent Publication no. WO 2006/063067). This site is
   distinct from that occupied by LIGHT but overlaps the gD binding site of HVEM.
35 While binding of HVEM to LIGHT induces a strong immune response, binding
                                           28

   of HVEM to BTLA results in negative regulation of T cell responses (Murphy et
   al. (2006) Nat. Rev. Immunol. 6:671-681). It has been indicated that binding of
   BTLA to HVEM activates tyrosine phosphorylation of BTLA thereby inducing
   association with the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 (Gavrieli
 5 et al. (2003) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 312:1236), although some data
   question whether SHP recruitment is responsible for the negative regulatory
   activity of BTLA (Chemnitz et al. (2006) J. Immunol. 176:6603-6614).
                  Soluble HVEM has been shown to inhibit anti-CD3-induced
   proliferation of CD4+ T cells, with this effect being reversed by anti-BTLA
10 antibodies (Gonzalez et al. (2005) Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 102:1116-1121).
   Similarly, an agonistic anti-BTLA monoclonal antibody was shown to inhibit anti
   CD3-mediated CD4+ T-cell proliferation and cytokine production (Krieg et al.
   (2005) J. Immunol. 175:6420-6472). Mice lacking an intact BTLA gene show
   an increased sensitivity to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,
15 (Watanabe et al. (2003) Nat. Immunol. 4:670-679) and prolonged airway
   inflammation (Deppong et al. (2006) J. Immunol. 176:3909-3913).
                  In some embodiments, binding domains of this disclosure
   comprise VL and VH domains specific for a BTLA as described herein. In
   certain embodiments, the VL and VH domains are human. The VL and VH
20 domains may be arranged in either orientation and may be separated by up to
   about a 30 amino acid linker as disclosed herein or any other amino acid
   sequence capable of providing a spacer function compatible with interaction of
   the two sub-binding domains. In certain embodiments, a linker joining the VL
   and VH domains comprises an amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID
25 NOs:43-166, 244, 307, 320, 355-379 and 383-398, such as the linker provided
   in SEQ ID NO:244, Linker 46 (SEQ ID NO:88), Linker 130 (SEQ ID NO:163), or
   Linker 131 (SEQ ID NO:164). Multi-specific binding domains can have at least
   two specific sub-binding domains, by analogy to camelid antibody organization,
   or at least four specific sub-binding domains, by analogy to the more
30 conventional mammalian antibody organization of paired VL and VH chains.
                  In further embodiments, binding domains specific for BTLA of this
   disclosure may comprise one or more complementarity determining region
   ("CDR"), or multiple copies of one or more such CDRs, which have been
   obtained, derived, or designed from variable regions of an anti-BTLA scFv or
35 Fab fragment or from heavy or light chain variable regions thereof. Thus, a
   binding domain of this disclosure can comprise a single CDR from a variable
                                             29

   region of an anti-BTLA, or it can comprise multiple CDRs that can be the same
   or different.
   GITRL
                  As noted above, in certain embodiments the present disclosure
 5 provides polypeptides containing a binding region or domain that is a GITRL
   antagonist (i.e., can inhibit GITRL signaling). In some embodiments, the GITRL
   antagonist binding domain is a GITR ectodomain (also referred to as sGITR;
   SEQ ID NO: 39 and 40; signal peptides: amino acids 1-25 for each of these
   sequences) or a functional sub-domain thereof. In other embodiments, the
10 GITRL antagonist binding domain is a single chain immunoglobulin-like variable
   domain, such as a scFv, specific for GITRL. Antagonistic antibodies against
   GITRL are described, for example, in US Patent Publication No. 2005/0014224.
                  Glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR; also
   known as AITR), a type I transmembrane protein, is a member of the TNF
15 receptor superfamily (Nocentini et al. (2007) Eur. J Immunol. 37:1165-69).
   GITR plays an important role in the regulation of T cell proliferation and TCR
   mediated apoptosis. GITR expression is upregulated on T cells, with a high
   level of GITR being constitutive expressed on CD4*CD25* regulatory T cells
   (Kwon et al. (2003) Exp. Mol. Med. 35:8-16), with expression also occurring on
20 macrophages, B cells and NK cells (Liu et al. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283:8202
   8210). GITR's cognate ligand, GITRL is constitutively expressed on antigen
   presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and B cells. Binding of GITR to GITRL
   has been shown to render CD4*CD25- effector T cells resistant to the inhibitory
   effects of CD4*CD25* regulatory T cells. GITR activation by either GITRL or an
25 agonistic antibody has been shown to increase TCR-induced T cell proliferation
   and cytokine production, and to rescue T cells from anti-CD3-induced apoptosis
   (Nocentini et al. (1997) Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 94:6216-6221). In addition,
   binding of GITR to GITRL can inhibit T regulatory cells and/or render effector T
   cells more resistant to T regulatory cell-mediated suppression (Kanamaru et al.
30 (2004) J. Immunol. 172:7306-7314).
                  Studies have shown that administration of anti-GITR mAb during
   the induction phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis significantly
   enhances the severity of clinical disease as well as increasing CNS
   inflammation and autoreactive T cell responses (Kohm et al. (2004) J. Immunol.
35  172:4686-4690). In addition, activation of GITR signaling exacerbates both
                                            30

   murine asthma and collagen-induced arthritis (Patel et al. (2005) Eur. J.,
   Immunol. 35:3581-90).
                  In some embodiments, binding domains of this disclosure
   comprise VL and VH domains specific for GITRL as described herein. In certain
 5 embodiments, the VL and VH domains are human. The VL and VH domains may
   be arranged in either orientation and may be separated by up to about a 30
   amino acid linker as disclosed herein or any other amino acid sequence
   capable of providing a spacer function compatible with interaction of the two
   sub-binding domains. In certain embodiments, a linker joining the VL and VH
10 domains comprises an amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NOs:43
   166, 244, 307, 320, 355-379 and 383-398, such as the linker provided in SEQ
   ID NO:244, Linker 46 (SEQ ID NO:88), Linker 130 (SEQ ID NO:163), or Linker
   131 (SEQ ID NO:164). Multi-specific binding domains can have at least two
   specific sub-binding domains, by analogy to camelid antibody organization, or
15 at least four specific sub-binding domains, by analogy to the more conventional
   mammalian antibody organization of paired VL and VH chains.
                  In further embodiments, binding domains specific for GITRL of
   this disclosure may comprise one or more complementarity determining region
   ("CDR"), or multiple copies of one or more such CDRs, which have been
20 obtained, derived, or designed from variable regions of an anti-GITRL scFv or
   Fab fragment or from heavy or light chain variable regions thereof. Thus, a
   binding domain of this disclosure can comprise a single CDR from a variable
   region of an anti-GITRL, or it can comprise multiple CDRs that can be the same
   or different. In certain embodiments, binding domains of this disclosure
25 comprise VL and VH domains specific for a GITRL comprising framework
   regions and CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 regions.
   CD40
                  As noted above, in certain embodiments the present disclosure
   provides polypeptides containing a binding region or domain that is a CD40
30 antagonist (i.e., can inhibit CD40 signaling). In some embodiments, the CD40
   antagonist binding domain is a single chain immunoglobulin-like variable
   domain, such as a scFv, specific for CD40. Antagonistic antibodies against
   CD40 are described, for example in US Patent Publication no. US
   2008/0057070, and US Patents 5,874,082 and 6,838,261.
                                           31

                   CD40 is a 55 kDa cell-surface antigen found on the surface of
   normal and neoplastic B cells, dendritic cells, antigen presenting cells,
   endothelial cells, monocytic cells and epithelial cells. CD40 expression on
   antigen presenting cells plays an important co-stimulatory role in the action of
 5 T-helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Expression of the CD40 ligand (CD40L,
   also known as CD1 54) is upregulated on T cells during a normal immune
   response. Binding of T cell expressed CD40L to B cell expressed CD40 leads
   to B cell proliferation and differentiation, antibody production, isotope switching
   and B-cell memory generation. A human anti-CD40 antagonistic antibody has
10 been shown to have antileukemia activity on human chronic lymphocytic
   leukemia cells (Luqman et al. (2008) Blood 112:711-720).
                   In some embodiments, binding domains of this disclosure
   comprise VL and VH domains specific for CD40 as described, for example, in
   US Patent Publication no. US 2008/0057070. In certain embodiments, the VL
15 and VH domains are human. The VL and VH domains may be arranged in either
   orientation and may be separated by up to about a 30 amino acid linker as
   disclosed herein or any other amino acid sequence capable of providing a
   spacer function compatible with interaction of the two sub-binding domains. In
   certain embodiments, a linker joining the VL and VH domains comprises an
20 amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NOs:43-166, 244, 307, 320, 355
   379 and 383-398, such as the linker provided in SEQ ID NO:244, Linker 46
   (SEQ ID NO:88), Linker 130 (SEQ ID NO:163), or Linker 131 (SEQ ID NO:164).
   Multi-specific binding domains can have at least two specific sub-binding
   domains, by analogy to camelid antibody organization, or at least four specific
25 sub-binding domains, by analogy to the more conventional mammalian
   antibody organization of paired VL and VH chains.
                   In further embodiments, binding domains specific for CD40 of this
   disclosure may comprise one or more complementarity determining region
   ("CDR"), or multiple copies of one or more such CDRs, which have been
30 obtained, derived, or designed from variable regions of an anti-CD40 scFv or
   Fab fragment or from heavy or light chain variable regions thereof. Thus, a
   binding domain of this disclosure can comprise a single CDR from a variable
   region of an anti-CD40, or it can comprise multiple CDRs that can be the same
   or different. In certain embodiments, binding domains of this disclosure
35 comprise VL and VH domains specific for a CD40 comprising framework regions
                                              32

   and CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 regions as described, for example, in US Patent
   Publication no. US 2008/0057070.
   Multi-Specific Fusion Proteins
                  The present disclosure provides multi-specific fusion proteins
 5 comprising a domain that binds to a CD86 ("CD86 binding domain") and a
   domain that binds a molecule other than a CD86 ("heterologous binding
   domain"). In certain embodiments, the heterologous binding domain is an IL-10
   agonist, an HLA-G agonist, an HGF agonist, an IL-35 agonist, a PD-1 agonist, a
   BTLA agonist, a LIGHT antagonist, a GITRL antagonist or a CD40 antagonist.
10                In certain embodiments, the heterologous binding domain is an
   IL10 agonist, such as IL10, IL1 Fc or a single chain binding domain that
   specifically binds to IL OR1 or IL1OR2. In certain embodiments, the
   heterologous binding domain is an HLA-G agonist, such as an HLA-G1, an
   HLA-G5, an HLA-G mutein, or a functional region thereof (such as an
15 ectodomain), or a single chain binding domain that specifically binds to ILT2,
   ILT4 or KIR2DL4. In certain embodiments, the heterologous binding domain is
   an HGF agonist, such as an HGF or a sub-domain thereof. In certain
   embodiments, the heterologous binding domain is an IL35 agonist, such as an
   IL35 or a sub-domain thereof, a single chain IL35 or subdomain thereof, or a
20 single chain immunoglobulin-like variable domain specific for IL35R and having
   IL35 agonist activity. In certain embodiments, the heterologous binding domain
   is a LIGHT antagonist, such as a HVEM ectodomain or a sub-domain thereof,
   or a single chain immunoglobulin-like variable domain specific for LIGHT. In
   certain embodiments, the heterologous binding domain is a PD-1 agonist, such
25 as a PD1 -L1, PD1 -L2 or a sub-domain thereof, or a single chain
   immunoglobulin-like variable domain specific for PD-1. In certain embodiments,
   the heterologous binding domain is a BTLA agonist, such as a HVEM
   ectodomain or a sub-domain thereof, or a single chain immunoglobulin-like
   variable domain specific for BTLA. In certain embodiments, the heterologous
30 binding domain is a GITRL antagonist, such as a GITR ectodomain or a sub
   domain thereof, or a single chain immunoglobulin-like variable domain specific
   for GITRL. In certain embodiments, the heterologous binding domain is a
   CD40 antagonist, such as a single chain immunoglobulin-like variable domain
   specific for CD40.
                                           33

                   Generally, the fusion proteins of the present invention make use
   of mature proteins that do not include the leader peptide (signal peptide).
   Accordingly, while certain sequences provided herein for binding domain
   proteins (such as for CTLA4, CD28, HLA-G1 and HLA-G5 and others described
 5 herein) include the leader peptide, the skilled person would readily understand
   how to determine the mature protein sequence from sequences including a
   signal peptide. In certain embodiments, it may be useful to include the leader
   sequence.
                   It is contemplated that a CD86 binding domain may be at the
10 amino-terminus and the heterologous binding domain at the carboxy-terminus
   of a fusion protein. In certain embodiments, the xceptor molecule is as set forth
   in SEQ ID NO:9, 13, 17, 24, 28, 31, 35, 42, 171, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 187,
   189, 191, 193, 219, 221, 223, 237, 262, 302, 330, 336, 338, 340, or 400. It is
   also contemplated that the heterologous binding domain may be at the amino
15 terminus and the CD86 binding domain may be at the carboxy-terminus. In
   certain embodiments, the xceptor molecule is as set forth in SEQ ID NO:183,
   185,199,201,203,205,207,211,213,254,258,266,276,350,352,or354.
   As set forth herein, the binding domains of this disclosure may be fused to each
   end of an intervening domain (e.g., an immunoglobulin constant region or sub
20 region thereof). Furthermore, the two or more binding domains may be each
   joined to an intervening domain via a linker, as described herein.
                   As used herein, an "intervening domain" refers to an amino acid
   sequence that simply functions as a scaffold for one or more binding domains
   so that the fusion protein will exist primarily (e.g., 50% or more of a population
25 of fusion proteins) or substantially (e.g., 90% or more of a population of fusion
   proteins) as a single chain polypeptide in a composition. For example, certain
   intervening domains can have a structural function (e.g., spacing, flexibility,
   rigidity) or biological function (e.g., an increased half-life in plasma, such as in
   human blood). Exemplary intervening domains that can increase half-life of the
30 fusion proteins of this disclosure in plasma include albumin, transferrin, a
   scaffold domain that binds a serum protein, or the like, or fragments thereof.
                   In certain embodiments, the intervening domain contained in a
   multi-specific fusion protein of this disclosure is a "dimerization domain," which
   refers to an amino acid sequence that is capable of promoting the association
35 of at least two single chain polypeptides or proteins via non-covalent or
   covalent interactions, such as by hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions,
                                               34

   Van der Waal's forces, disulfide bonds, hydrophobic interactions, or the like, or
   any combination thereof. Exemplary dimerization domains include
   immunoglobulin heavy chain constant regions or sub-regions. It should be
   understood that a dimerization domain can promote the formation of dimers or
 5 higher order multimer complexes (such as trimers, tetramers, pentamers,
   hexamers, septamers, octamers, etc.).
                   A "constant sub-region" is a term defined herein to refer to a
   peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence that corresponds to or is derived from
   part or all of one or more constant region domains, but not all constant region
10 domains of a source antibody. In a preferred embodiment, the constant sub
   region is an IgG CH2CH3, preferably an IgG1 CH2CH3. In some
   embodiments, the constant region domains of a fusion protein of this disclosure
   may lack or have minimal effector functions of antibody-dependent cell
   mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement activation and complement
15 dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), while retaining the ability to bind some Fc
   receptors (such as FcRn binding) and retaining a relatively long half life in vivo.
   In certain embodiments, a binding domain of this disclosure is fused to a human
   IgG1 constant region or sub-region, wherein the IgG1 constant region or sub
   region has one or more of the following amino acids mutated: leucine at
20 position 234 (L234), leucine at position 235 (L235), glycine at position 237
   (G237), glutamate at position 318 (E318), lysine at position 320 (K320), lysine
   at position 322 (K322), or any combination thereof (numbering according to
   Kabat). For example, any one or more of these amino acids can be changed to
   alanine. In a further embodiment, an IgG1 Fc domain has each of L234, L235,
25 G237, E318, K320, and K322 (according to EU numbering) mutated to an
   alanine (i.e., L234A, L235A, G237A, E318A, K320A, and K322A, respectively),
   and optionally an N297A mutation as well (i.e., essentially eliminating
   glycosylation of the CH2 domain).
                   Methods are known in the art for making mutations inside or
30 outside an Fc domain that can alter Fc interactions with Fc receptors (CD16,
   CD32, CD64, CD89, FcER1, FcRn) or with the complement component C1 q
   (see, e.g., US Patent No. 5,624,821; Presta (2002) Curr. Pharma. Biotechnol.
   3:237). Particular embodiments of this disclosure include compositions
   comprising immunoglobulin or fusion proteins that have a constant region or
35 sub-region from human IgG wherein binding to FcRn and protein A are
   preserved and wherein the Fc domain no longer interacts or minimally interacts
                                            35

   with other Fc receptors or C1 q. For example, a binding domain of this
   disclosure can be fused to a human IgG1 constant region or sub-region wherein
   the asparagine at position 297 (N297 under the Kabat numbering) has been
   mutated to another amino acid to reduce or eliminate glycosylation at this site
 5 and, therefore, abrogate efficient Fc binding to FcyR and C1q. Another
   exemplary mutation is a P331S, which diminishes C1q binding but does not
   affect Fc binding.
                  In further embodiments, an immunoglobulin Fc region may have
   an altered glycosylation pattern relative to an immunoglobulin reference
10 sequence. For example, any of a variety of genetic techniques may be
   employed to alter one or more particular amino acid residues that form a
   glycosylation site (see Co et al. (1993) Mol. Immunol. 30:1361; Jacquemon et
   al. (2006) J. Thromb. Haemost. 4:1047; Schuster et al. (2005) Cancer Res.
   65:7934; Warnock et al. (2005) Biotechnol. Bioeng. 92:831), such as N297 of
15 the CH2 domain (EU numbering). Alternatively, the host cells producing fusion
   proteins of this disclosure may be engineered to produce an altered
   glycosylation pattern. One method known in the art, for example, provides
   altered glycosylation in the form of bisected, non-fucosylated variants that
   increase ADCC. The variants result from expression in a host cell containing
20 an oligosaccharide-modifying enzyme. Alternatively, the Potelligent technology
   of BioWa/Kyowa Hakko is contemplated to reduce the fucose content of
   glycosylated molecules according to this disclosure. In one known method, a
   CHO host cell for recombinant immunoglobulin production is provided that
   modifies the glycosylation pattern of the immunoglobulin Fc region, through
25 production of GDP-fucose.
                  Alternatively, chemical techniques are used to alter the
   glycosylation pattern of fusion proteins of this disclosure. For example, a
   variety of glycosidase and/or mannosidase inhibitors provide one or more of
   desired effects of increasing ADCC activity, increasing Fc receptor binding, and
30 altering glycosylation pattern. In certain embodiments, cells expressing a
   multispecific fusion protein of the instant disclosure (containing a CD86
   antagonist domain linked to an IL-10 agonist, an HLA-G agonist, an HGF
   agonist, an IL-35 agonist, a PD-1 agonist, a BTLA agonist, a LIGHT antagonist,
   a GITRL antagonist or a CD40 antagonist) are grown in a culture medium
35 comprising a carbohydrate modifier at a concentration that increases the ADCC
   of immunoglycoprotein molecules produced by said host cell, wherein said
                                            36

   carbohydrate modifier is at a concentration of less than 800 pM. In a preferred
   embodiment, the cells expressing these multispecific fusion proteins are grown
    in a culture medium comprising castanospermine or kifunensine, more
    preferably castanospermine at a concentration of 100-800 pM, such as 100 pM,
 5 200 pM, 300 pM, 400 pM, 500 pM, 600 pM, 700 pM, or 800 pM. Methods for
   altering glycosylation with a carbohydrate modifier such as castanospermine
   are provided in US Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0041756 or PCT
    Publication No. WO 2008/052030.
                    In another embodiment, the immunoglobulin Fc region may have
10 amino acid modifications that affect binding to effector cell Fc receptors. These
    modifications can be made using any technique known in the art, such as the
   approach disclosed in Presta et al. (2001) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 30:487. In
   another approach, the Xencor XmAbTM technology is available to engineer
   constant sub-regions corresponding to Fc domains to enhance cell killing
15 effector function (see Lazar et al. (2006) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. (USA)
    103:4005). Using this approach, for example, one can generate constant sub
    regions with improved specificity and binding for FCyR, thereby enhancing cell
    killing effector function.
                    In still further embodiments, a constant region or sub-region can
20 optionally increase plasma half-life or placental transfer in comparison to a
   corresponding fusion protein lacking such an intervening domain. In certain
   embodiments, the extended plasma half-life of a fusion protein of this disclosure
   is at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least ten, at least 12,
   at least 18, at least 20, at least 24, at least 30, at least 36, at least 40, at least
25 48 hours, at least several days, at least a week, at least two weeks, at least
   several weeks, at least a month, at least two months, at least several months,
   or more in a human.
                    A constant sub-region may include part or all of any of the
   following domains: a CH2 domain, a CH3 domain (IgA, IgD, IgG, IgE, or IgM),
30 and a CH4 domain (IgE or IgM). A constant sub-region as defined herein,
   therefore, can refer to a polypeptide that corresponds to a portion of an
   immunoglobulin constant region. The constant sub-region may comprise a CH2
   domain and a CH3 domain derived from the same, or different,
   immunoglobulins, antibody isotypes, or allelic variants. In some embodiments,
35 the CH3 domain is truncated and comprises a carboxy-terminal sequence listed
   in US Patent Application No. 12/041,590 (which is a CIP of
                                               37

   PCT/US2007/071052) as SEQ ID NOS:366-371. In certain embodiments, a
   constant sub-region of a polypeptide of this disclosure has a CH2 domain and
   CH3   domain, which may optionally have an amino-terminal linker, a carboxy
   terminal linker, or a linker at both ends.
 5                A "linker" is a peptide that joins or links other peptides or
   polypeptides, such as a linker of about 2 to about 150 amino acids. In fusion
   proteins of this disclosure, a linker can join an intervening domain (e.g., an
   immunoglobulin-derived constant sub-region) to a binding domain or a linker
   can join two variable regions of a binding domain, or two regions within a single
10 chain polypeptide formed from a heterodimeric molecule, such as EB3 (SEQ
   ID NO: 25) and the p35subunit of IL12 (SEQ ID NO: 26) of IL35. For example,
   a linker can be an amino acid sequence obtained, derived, or designed from an
   antibody hinge region sequence, a sequence linking a binding domain to a
   receptor, or a sequence linking a binding domain to a cell surface
15 transmembrane region or membrane anchor. In some embodiments, a linker
   can have at least one cysteine capable of participating in at least one disulfide
   bond under physiological conditions or other standard peptide conditions (e.g.,
   peptide purification conditions, conditions for peptide storage). In certain
   embodiments, a linker corresponding or similar to an immunoglobulin hinge
20 peptide retains a cysteine that corresponds to the hinge cysteine disposed
   toward the amino-terminus of that hinge. In further embodiments, a linker is
   from an IgG1 or IgG2A hinge and has one cysteine or two cysteines
   corresponding to hinge cysteines. In certain embodiments, one or more
   disulfide bonds are formed as inter-chain disulfide bonds between intervening
25 domains. In other embodiments, fusion proteins of this disclosure can have an
   intervening domain fused directly to a binding domain (i.e., absent a linker or
   hinge). In some embodiments, the intervening domain is a dimerization
   domain, such as an IgG1 CH2CH3 Fc portion.
                  The intervening or dimerization domain of multi-specific fusion
30 proteins of this disclosure may be connected to one or more terminal binding
   domains by a peptide linker. In addition to providing a spacing function, a linker
   can provide flexibility or rigidity suitable for properly orienting the one or more
   binding domains of a fusion protein, both within the fusion protein and between
   or among the fusion proteins and their target(s). Further, a linker can support
35 expression of a full-length fusion protein and stability of the purified protein both
   in vitro and in vivo following administration to a subject in need thereof, such as
                                               38

   a human, and is preferably non-immunogenic or poorly immunogenic in those
   same subjects. In certain embodiments, a linker of an intervening or a
   dimerization domain of multi-specific fusion proteins of this disclosure may
   comprise part or all of a human immunoglobulin hinge.
 5                Additionally, a binding domain may comprise a VH and a VL
   domain, and these variable region domains may be combined by a linker.
   Exemplary variable region binding domain linkers include those belonging to
   the (GlynSer) family, such as (Gly 3Ser)n(Gly 4Ser)1 , (Gly 3Ser)1(Gly 4Ser)n,
   (Gly 3Ser)n(Gly 4Ser)n, or (Gly 4Ser)n, wherein n is an integer of 1 to 5 (see, e.g.,
10 Linkers 22, 29, 46, 89, 90, 116, 130, and 131 corresponding to SEQ ID
   NOS:64, 71, 88, 131, 132, 149, 163 and 164, respectively) . In preferred
   embodiments, these (Gly 4Ser)-based linkers are used to link variable domains
   and are not used to link a binding domain (e.g., scFv) to an intervening domain
   (e.g., an IgG CH2CH3).
15                Exemplary linkers that can be used to join an intervening domain
   (e.g., an immunoglobulin-derived constant sub-region) to a binding domain or a
   linker that can join two variable regions of a binding domain are listed in SEQ ID
   NOS:43-166, 244, 307, 320, 355-379 and 383-398.
                  Linkers contemplated in this disclosure include, for example,
20 peptides derived from any inter-domain region of an immunoglobulin
   superfamily member (e.g., an antibody hinge region) or a stalk region of C-type
   lectins, a family of type II membrane proteins. These linkers range in length
   from about two to about 150 amino acids, or about two to about 40 amino acids,
   or about eight to about 20 amino acids, preferably about ten to about 60 amino
25 acids, more preferably about 10 to about 30 amino acids, and most preferably
   about 15 to about 25 amino acids. For example, Linker 1 is two amino acids in
   length and Linker 116 is 36 amino acids in length (Linkers 1-133 are provided in
   SEQ ID NOS:43-166, respectively; additional exemplary linkers are provided in
   SEQ ID NOS:244, 307, 320, 355-379, and 383-398).
30                Beyond general length considerations, a linker suitable for use in
   the fusion proteins of this disclosure includes an antibody hinge region selected
   from an IgG hinge, IgA hinge, IgD hinge, IgE hinge, or variants thereof. In
   certain embodiments, a linker may be an antibody hinge region (upper and core
   region) selected from human IgG1, human IgG2, human IgG3, human IgG4, or
35 fragments or variants thereof. As used herein, a linker that is an
   "immunoglobulin hinge region" refers to the amino acids found between the
                                             39

   carboxyl end of CH1 and the amino terminal end of CH2 (for IgG, IgA, and IgD)
   or the amino terminal end of CH3 (for IgE and IgM). A "wild type
   immunoglobulin hinge region," as used herein, refers to a naturally occurring
   amino acid sequence interposed between and connecting the CH1 and CH2
 5 regions (for igG, IgA, and igD) or interposed between and connecting the CH2
   and CH3 regions (for IgE and igM) found in the heavy chain of an antibody. In
   preferred embodiments, the wild type immunoglobulin hinge region sequences
   are human.
                  According to crystallographic studies, an IgG hinge domain can
10 be functionally and structurally subdivided into three regions: the upper hinge
   region, the core or middle hinge region, and the lower hinge region (Shin et al.
   (1992) Immunological Reviews 130:87). Exemplary upper hinge regions
   include EPKSCDKTHT (SEQ ID NO:383) as found in IgG1, ERKCCVE (SEQ ID
   NO:384) as found in IgG2, ELKTPLGDTTHT (SEQ ID NO:385) or
15 EPKSCDTPPP (SEQ ID NO:386) as found in IgG3, and ESKYGPP (SEQ ID
   NO:387) as found in IgG4. Exemplary middle hinge regions include CPPCP
   (SEQ ID NO:398) as found in IgG1 and IgG2, CPRCP (SEQ ID NO:388) as
   found in IgG3, and CPSCP (SEQ ID NO:389) as found in IgG4. While IgG1,
   IgG2, and IgG4 antibodies each appear to have a single upper and middle
20 hinge, IgG3 has four in tandem - one of ELKTPLGDTTHTCPRCP (SEQ ID
   NO:390) and three of EPKSCDTPPPCPRCP (SEQ ID NO:391).
                  IgA and lgD antibodies appear to lack an IgG-like core region, and
   IgD appears to have two upper hinge regions in tandem (see SEQ ID NOS:392
   and 393). Exemplary wild type upper hinge regions found in IgAl and IgA2
25 antibodies are set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 394 and 395, respectively.
                  IgE and IgM antibodies, in contrast, instead of a typical hinge
   region have a CH2 region with hinge-like properties. Exemplary wild-type CH2
   upper hinge-like sequences of IgE and IgM are set forth in SEQ ID NO:396
   (VCSRDFTPPT VKILQSSSDG GGHFPPTIQL LCLVSGYTPG TINITWLEDG

   QATGFSPRQI QVSWLREGKQ VGSGVTTDQV QAEAKESGPT TYKVTSTLTI
   KESDWLGQSM FTCRVDHRGL TFQQNASSMC VP), respectively.
                  An "altered wild type immunoglobulin hinge region" or "altered
35 immunoglobulin hinge region" refers to (a) a wild type immunoglobulin hinge
   region with up to 30% amino acid changes (e.g., up to 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, or
                                            40

   5% amino acid substitutions or deletions), (b) a portion of a wild type
   immunoglobulin hinge region that is at least 10 amino acids (e.g., at least 12,
   13, 14 or 15 amino acids) in length with up to 30% amino acid changes (e.g., up
   to 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, or 5% amino acid substitutions or deletions), or (c) a
 5 portion of a wild type immunoglobulin hinge region that comprises the core
   hinge region (which portion may be 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15, or
   at least 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 amino acids in length). In
   certain embodiments, one or more cysteine residues in a wild type
   immunoglobulin hinge region may be substituted by one or more other amino
10 acid residues (e.g., one or more serine residues). An altered immunoglobulin
   hinge region may alternatively or additionally have a proline residue of a wild
   type immunoglobulin hinge region substituted by another amino acid residue
   (e.g., a serine residue).
                   Alternative hinge and linker sequences that can be used as
15 connecting regions may be crafted from portions of cell surface receptors that
   connect IgV-like or IgC-like domains. Regions between IgV-like domains where
   the cell surface receptor contains multiple IgV-like domains in tandem and
   between IgC-like domains where the cell surface receptor contains multiple
   tandem IgC-like regions could also be used as connecting regions or linker
20 peptides. In certain embodiments, hinge and linker sequences are from five to
   60 amino acids long, and may be primarily flexible, but may also provide more
   rigid characteristics, and may contain primarily an a-helical structure with
   minimal p-sheet structure. Preferably, sequences are stable in plasma and
   serum and are resistant to proteolytic cleavage. In some embodiments,
25 sequences may contain a naturally occurring or added motif such as CPPC
   (SEQ ID NO:422) that confers the capacity to form a disulfide bond or multiple
   disulfide bonds to stabilize the C-terminus of the molecule. In other
   embodiments, sequences may contain one or more glycosylation sites.
   Examples of hinge and linker sequences include interdomain regions between
30 the IgV-like and IgC-like or between the IgC-like or IgV-like domains of CD2,
   CD4, CD22, CD33, CD48, CD58, CD66, CD80, CD86, CD96, CD150, CD166,
   and CD244. Alternative hinges may also be crafted from disulfide-containing
   regions of Type II receptors from non-immunoglobulin superfamily members
   such as CD69, CD72, and CD161.
35                 In certain embodiments, a linker of the present invention
   comprises a scorpion linker. Scorpion linkers include peptides derived from
                                               41

   interdomain regions of an immunoglobulin superfamily member, e.g., hinge-like
   peptides derived from immunoglobulin hinge regions, such as IgG1, IgG2,
   IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgE hinge regions. In certain embodiments, a hinge-like
   scorpion linker will retain at least one cysteine capable of forming an interchain
 5 disulfide bond under physiological conditions. Scorpion linkers derived from
   IgG1 may have 1 cysteine or two cysteines, and may retain the cysteine
   corresponding to an N-terminal hinge cysteine of wild-type IgG1. Non-hinge
   like peptides are also contemplated as scorpion linkers, provided that such
   peptides provide sufficient spacing and flexibility to provide a single-chain
10 protein capable of forming two binding domains, one located towards each
   protein terminus (N and C) relative to a more centrally located constant sub
   region domain. Exemplary non-hinge-like scorpion linkers include peptides
   from the stalk region of C-type lectin stalk regions of Type Il membrane
   proteins, such as the stalk regions of CD69, CD72, CD94, NKG2A and NKG2D.
15 In some embodiments, the scorpion linker comprises a sequence selected from
   the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs:355-359 and 365.
                  In some embodiments, a linker has a single cysteine residue for
   formation of an interchain disulfide bond. In other embodiments, a linker has
   two cysteine residues for formation of interchain disulfide bonds. In further
20 embodiments, a linker is derived from an immunoglobulin interdomain region
   (e.g., an antibody hinge region) or a Type II C-type lectin stalk region (derived
   from a Type II membrane protein; see, e.g., exemplary lectin stalk region
   sequences set forth in of PCT Application Publication No. WO 2007/146968,
   such as SEQ ID NOS:111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131,
25 133,135,149,151,153,155,157,159,161,163,165,167,169,231,233,235,
   237,239,241,243,245,247,249,251,253,255,257,259,261,263,265,267,
   269, 271, 273, 275, 277, 279, 281, 287, 289, 297, 305, 307, 309-311, 313-331,
   346, 373-377, 380, or 381 from that publication, which sequences are
   incorporated herein by reference).
30                In one aspect, exemplary multi-specific fusion proteins containing
   a CD86 binding domain as described herein will also contain at least one
   additional binding region or domain that is specific for a target other than a
   CD86 (a "heterologous binding domain"). For example, a multi-specific fusion
   protein of this disclosure has a CD86 binding domain linked by an intervening
35 domain to a binding domain that is an IL-10 agonist, an HLA-G agonist, an HGF
   agonist, an IL-35 agonist, a PD-1 agonist, a BTLA agonist, a LIGHT antagonist,
                                             42

   a GITRL antagonist or a CD40 antagonist. In certain embodiments, a multi
   specific fusion protein comprises a first and second binding domain, a first and
   second linker, and an intervening domain, wherein one end of the intervening
   domain is fused via the first linker to a first binding domain that is a CD86
 5 binding domain (e.g., a CTLA4 ectodomain, a CD28 ectodomain, an anti-CD86)
   and at the other end is fused via the second linker to a different binding domain
   that is an IL-10 agonist, an HLA-G agonist, an HGF agonist, an IL-35 agonist, a
   PD-1 agonist, a BTLA agonist, a LIGHT antagonist, a GITRL antagonist or a
   CD40 antagonist.
10                In certain embodiments, the first linker and second linker of a
   multi-specific fusion protein of this disclosure are each independently selected
   from, for example, Linkers 1-133 as provided in SEQ ID NOS:43-166 and the
   linkers provided in SEQ ID NOS:244, 307, 320, 355-379 and 383-398. For
   example, the first or second linker can be any one of Linkers 47, 58, 126-131
15 (SEQ ID NOS:89, 100, and 159-164, respectively), or the linkers provided in
   SEQ ID NO:244 or 355-379, or any combination thereof. In further examples,
   one linker is Linker 47 (SEQ ID NO:89) or Linker 132 (SEQ ID NO:165) and the
   other linker is the linker provided in SEQ ID NO:355, or Linker 127 (SEQ ID
    NO:160) or one linker is Linker 58 (SEQ ID NO:100) or Linker 133 (SEQ ID
20  NO:166) and the other linker is Linker 126 (SEQ ID NO:159), or one linker is
   Linker 58 (SEQ ID NO:100) or Linker 133 (SEQ ID NO:166) and the other linker
   is Linker 127 (SEQ ID NO:160), or one linker is Linker 58 (SEQ ID NO:100) or
   Linker 133 (SEQ ID NO:166) and the other linker is Linker 128 (SEQ ID
    NO:161), or one linker is Linker 58 (SEQ ID NO:100) or Linker 133 (SEQ ID
25  NO:166) and the other linker is Linker 129 (SEQ ID NO:162). In further
   examples, binding domains of this disclosure that comprise VH and VL domains,
   such as those specific for CD86, can have a further (third) linker between the
   VH and VL domains, such as the linker provided in SEQ ID NO:244, SEQ ID
    NO:89, Linker 46 (SEQ ID NO:88), Linker 130 (SEQ ID NO:163), or Linker 131
30 (SEQ ID NO:164). In any of these embodiments, the linkers may be flanked by
   one to five additional amino acids internally (e.g., Linker 131 has an alanine
   internal to the (G4 S) core sequence), on either end (e.g., Linker 130 has a
   serine on the amino-end of the (G4 S) core sequence) or on both ends (e.g.,
   Linker 120 has two amino acids (asparagine-tyrosine) on one end and three
35 amino acids (glycine-asparagine-serine) one the other end of the (G4 S) core
   sequence), which may simply be a result of creating such a recombinant
                                             43

   molecule (e.g., use of a particular restriction enzyme site to join nucleic acid
   molecules may result in the insertion of one to several amino acids), and for
   purposes of this disclosure may be considered a part of any particular linker
   core sequence.
 5                In further embodiments, the intervening domain of a multi-specific
   fusion protein of this disclosure is comprised of an immunoglobulin constant
   region or sub-region, wherein the intervening domain is disposed between a
   CD86 binding domain and a binding domain that is an IL-10 agonist, an HLA-G
   agonist, an HGF agonist, an IL-35 agonist, a PD-1 agonist, a BTLA agonist, a
10 LIGHT antagonist, a GITRL antagonist or a CD40 antagonist. In certain
   embodiments, the intervening domain of a multi-specific fusion protein of this
   disclosure has a CD86 binding domain at the amino-terminus and a binding
   domain that is an IL-10 agonist, an HLA-G agonist, an HGF agonist, an IL-35
   agonist, a PD-1 agonist, a BTLA agonist, a LIGHT antagonist, a GITRL
15 antagonist or a CD40 antagonist at the carboxy-terminus. In other
   embodiments, the intervening domain of a multi-specific fusion protein of this
   disclosure has a binding domain that is an IL-10 agonist, an HLA-G agonist, an
   HGF agonist, an IL-35 agonist, a PD-1 agonist, a BTLA agonist, a LIGHT
   antagonist, a GITRL antagonist or a CD40 antagonist at the amino-terminus
20 and a CD86 binding domain at the carboxy-terminus.
                  In further embodiments, the immunoglobulin constant region sub
   region includes CH2 and CH3 domains of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). In
   related embodiments, the IgG1 CH2 and CH3 domains have one or more of the
   following amino acids mutated (i.e., have a different amino acid at that position):
25 leucine at position 234 (L234), leucine at position 235 (L235), glycine at position
   237 (G237), glutamate at position 318 (E318), lysine at position 320 (K320),
   lysine at position 322 (K322), or any combination thereof (numbering according
   to Kabat). For example, any one of these amino acids can be changed to
   alanine. In a further embodiment, according to Kabat numbering, the CH2
30 domain has each of L234, L235, and G237 mutated to an alanine (i.e., L234A,
   L235A, and G237A, respectively), and the IgG1 CH3 domain has each of E318,
   K320, and K322 mutated to an alanine (i.e., E318A, K320A, and K322A,
   respectively).
                  In certain embodiments, a multi-specific fusion protein of this
35 disclosure may comprise a small modular immunopharmaceutical" (SMIPTM).           In
   this regard, the term SMIPTM refers to a highly modular compound class having
                                             44

   enhanced drug properties over monoclonal and recombinant antibodies. SMIPs
   comprise a single polypeptide chain including a target-specific binding domain,
   based, for example, upon an antibody variable domain, in combination with a
   variable FC region that permits the specific recruitment of a desired class of
 5 effector cells (such as, e.g., macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells) and/or
   recruitment of complement-mediated killing. Depending upon the choice of
   target and hinge regions, SMIPs can signal or block signaling via cell surface
   receptors. As used herein, engineered fusion proteins, termed "small modular
   immunopharmaceutical" or "SMIPTM products", are as described in US Patent
10 Publication Nos. 2003/133939, 2003/0118592, and 2005/0136049, and
   International Patent Publications W002/056910, W02005/037989, and
   W02005/017148.
                   In some embodiments, a multi-specific fusion protein may
   comprise a PIMS molecule such as those described in US Patent Publication
15 No. 2009/0148447 and International Patent Publication W02009/023386.
                   In certain embodiments, the muti-specific fusion proteins of the
   invention can be engineered with different front and back end affinities in order
   to target specific cell types. For example, use of an anti-CD86 binding domain
   (e.g., 3D1, FUN1, or humanized variants thereof) that has a higher affinity for
20 CD86 than an engineered IL10 agonist (e.g., having an 187A or 187S mutation,
   or a monolL10 structure) has for huIL1OR1, and combining such molecules in
   an xceptor molecule of this disclcosure can be used to favor targeting to a
   specific cell type of interest, such as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In this
   regard, fusion proteins can be made that have higher or lower affinity for CD86
25 or higher or lower affinity for any of the heterologous target proteins described
   herein, depending on the desired cell type to target. In preferred embodiments,
   the CD86 antagonist binding domain preferentially targets the multi-target
   specific xceptor molecule to APCs by having a greater affinity for CD86 than the
   heterologous binding domain has for its binding partner.
30                 In some embodiments, a multi-specific fusion protein of this
   disclosure has a CD86 binding domain that comprises a CTLA4 extracellular
   domain or sub-domain, a CD28 extracellular domain or sub-domain, or a
   CD86-specific antibody-derived binding domain. In certain embodiments, a
   CD86-specific antibody-derived binding domain is derived from the FUN1
35 monoclonal antibody (see e.g., J Pathol. 1993 Mar;169(3):309-15); or derived
   from the 3D1 anti-CD86 monoclonal antibody. In certain embodiments, a CD86
                                             45

   binding domain is a sCTLA4, such as the mature polypeptide sequence of SEQ
   ID NO:1. In certain embodiments, the CD86 binding domain is a sCTLA4, such
   as the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 or a variable-like domain of CTLA4, such as
   SEQ ID NO:3, or a sub-domain thereof. In other embodiments, a CD86 binding
 5 domain is a sCD28, such as the mature polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:2
   (signal peptide: amino acids 1-18). In still further embodiments, the CD86
   binding domain comprises light and heavy chain variable domains from FUN1
   (e.g., SEQ ID NOS:305 and 306) or 3D1 (e.g., SEQ ID NOS:318 and 319),
   preferably in the form of an scFv.
10                 In further embodiments, a multi-specific fusion protein of this
   disclosure has a CD86 binding domain and a heterologous binding domain that
   is an IL-10 agonist, an HLA-G agonist, an HGF agonist, an IL-35 agonist, a PD
   1 agonist, a BTLA agonist, a LIGHT antagonist, a GITRL antagonist or a CD40
   antagonist (see e.g., the amino acid sequences of heterologous binding
15 domains provided in SEQ ID NOS:7, 14, 15, 18-22, 25, 26, 29, 32, 33, 36, 39
   and 40).
                  Exemplary structures of such multi-specific fusion proteins,
   referred to herein as Xceptor molecules, include N-BD1-ID-BD2-C, N-BD2-ID
   BD1-C, wherein N and C represent the amino-terminus and carboxy-terminus,
20 respectively; BD1 is a CD86 binding domain, such as an immunoglobulin-like or
   immunoglobulin variable region binding domain, or an ectodomain; X is an
   intervening domain, and BD2 is binding domain that is an IL-10 agonist, an
   HLA-G agonist, an HGF agonist, an IL-35 agonist, a PD-1 agonist, a BTLA
   agonist, a LIGHT antagonist, a GITRL antagonist or a CD40 antagonist. In
25 some constructs, X can comprise an immunoglobulin constant region or
   sub-region disposed between the first and second binding domains. In some
   embodiments, a multi-specific fusion protein of this disclosure has an
   intervening domain (X) comprising, from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus, a
   structure as follows: -L1 -X-L2-, wherein Li and L2 are each independently a
30 linker comprising from two to about 150 amino acids; and X is an
   immunoglobulin constant region or sub-region. In further embodiments, the
   multi-specific fusion protein will have an intervening domain that is albumin,
   transferrin, or another serum protein binding protein, wherein the fusion protein
   remains primarily or substantially as a single chain polypeptide in a
35 composition.

   Making Multi-Specific Fusion Proteins
                  To efficiently produce any of the binding domain polypeptides or
   fusion proteins described herein, a leader peptide is used to facilitate secretion
20 of expressed polypeptides and fusion proteins. Using any of the conventional
   leader peptides (signal sequences) is expected to direct nascently expressed
   polypeptides or fusion proteins into a secretory pathway and to result in
   cleavage of the leader peptide from the mature polypeptide or fusion protein at
   or near the junction between the leader peptide and the polypeptide or fusion
25 protein. A particular leader peptide will be chosen based on considerations
   known in the art, such as using sequences encoded by polynucleotides that
   allow the easy inclusion of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites at the
   beginning or end of the coding sequence for the leader peptide to facilitate
   molecular engineering, provided that such introduced sequences specify amino
30 acids that either do not interfere unacceptably with any desired processing of
   the leader peptide from the nascently expressed protein or do not interfere
   unacceptably with any desired function of a polypeptide or fusion protein
   molecule if the leader peptide is not cleaved during maturation of the
   polypeptides or fusion proteins. Exemplary leader peptides of this disclosure
35 include natural leader sequences (i.e., those expressed with the native protein)
                                            48

   or use of heterologous leader sequences, such as
   H3N-MDFQVQlFSFLLISASVIMSRG(X)n-CO 2H, wherein X is any amino acid
   and n is zero to three (SEQ ID NOS:167, 419, 420, and 421) or
   H3N-MEAPAQLLFLLLLWLPDTTG-CO 2 H (SEQ ID NO:168).
 5                As noted herein, variants and derivatives of binding domains,
   such as ectodomains, light and heavy variable regions, and CDRs described
   herein, are contemplated. In one example, insertion variants are provided
   wherein one or more amino acid residues supplement a specific binding agent
   amino acid sequence. Insertions may be located at either or both termini of the
10 protein, or may be positioned within internal regions of the specific binding
   agent amino acid sequence. Variant products of this disclosure also include
   mature specific binding agent products, i.e., specific binding agent products
   wherein a leader or signal sequence is removed, and the resulting protein
   having additional amino terminal residues. The additional amino terminal
15 residues may be derived from another protein, or may include one or more
   residues that are not identifiable as being derived from a specific protein.
   Polypeptides with an additional methionine residue at position -1 are
   contemplated, as are polypeptides of this disclosure with additional methionine
   and lysine residues at positions -2 and -1. Variants having additional Met, Met
20 Lys, or Lys residues (or one or more basic residues in general) are particularly
   useful for enhanced recombinant protein production in bacterial host cells.
                  As used herein, "amino acids" refer to a natural (those occurring
   in nature) amino acid, a substituted natural amino acid, a non-natural amino
   acid, a substituted non-natural amino acid, or any combination thereof. The
25 designations for natural amino acids are herein set forth as either the standard
   one- or three-letter code. Natural polar amino acids include asparagine (Asp or
   N) and glutamine (Gin or Q); as well as basic amino acids such as arginine (Arg
   or R), lysine (Lys or K), histidine (His or H), and derivatives thereof; and acidic
   amino acids such as aspartic acid (Asp or D) and glutamic acid (Glu or E), and
30 derivatives thereof. Natural hydrophobic amino acids include tryptophan (Trp or
   W), phenylalanine (Phe or F), isoleucine (lie or I), leucine (Leu or L), methionine
   (Met or M), valine (Val or V), and derivatives thereof; as well as other non-polar
   amino acids such as glycine (Gly or G), alanine (Ala or A), proline (Pro or P),
   and derivatives thereof. Natural amino acids of intermediate polarity include
35 serine (Ser or S), threonine (Thr or T), tyrosine (Tyr or Y), cysteine (Cys or C),
                                             49

   and derivatives thereof. Unless specified otherwise, any amino acid described
   herein may be in either the D- or L-configuration.
                 Substitution variants include those fusion proteins wherein one or
   more amino acid residues in an amino acid sequence are removed and
 5 replaced with alternative residues. In some embodiments, the substitutions are
   conservative in nature; however, this disclosure embraces substitutions that are
   also non-conservative. Amino acids can be classified according to physical
   properties and contribution to secondary and tertiary protein structure. A
   conservative substitution is recognized in the art as a substitution of one amino
10 acid for another amino acid that has similar properties. Exemplary conservative
   substitutions are set out in Table 1 (see WO 97/09433, page 10, published
   March 13, 1997), immediately below.

                  Variants or derivatives can also have additional amino acid
   residues which arise from use of specific expression systems. For example,
 5 use of commercially available vectors that express a desired polypeptide as
   part of a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion product provides the desired
   polypeptide having an additional glycine residue at position -1 after cleavage of
   the GST component from the desired polypeptide. Variants which result from
   expression in other vector systems are also contemplated, including those
10 wherein histidine tags are incorporated into the amino acid sequence, generally
   at the carboxy and/or amino terminus of the sequence.
                  Deletion variants are also contemplated wherein one or more
   amino acid residues in a binding domain of this disclosure are removed.
   Deletions can be effected at one or both termini of the fusion protein, or from
15 removal of one or more residues within the amino acid sequence.
                  In certain illustrative embodiments, fusion proteins of this
   disclosure are glycosylated, the pattern of glycosylation being dependent upon
   a variety of factors including the host cell in which the protein is expressed (if
   prepared in recombinant host cells) and the culture conditions.
20                This disclosure also provides derivatives of fusion proteins.
   Derivatives include specific binding domain polypeptides bearing modifications
   other than insertion, deletion, or substitution of amino acid residues. In certain
   embodiments, the modifications are covalent in nature, and include for
                                             51

   example, chemical bonding with polymers, lipids, other organic, and inorganic
   moieties. Derivatives of this disclosure may be prepared to increase circulating
   half-life of a specific binding domain polypeptide, or may be designed to
   improve targeting capacity for the polypeptide to desired cells, tissues, or
 5 organs.
                   This disclosure further embraces fusion proteins that are
   covalently modified or derivatized to include one or more water-soluble polymer
   attachments such as polyethylene glycol, polyoxyethylene glycol, or
   polypropylene glycol, as described U.S. Patent Nos: 4,640,835; 4,496,689;
10 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192 and 4,179,337. Still other useful polymers
   known in the art include monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, dextran, cellulose,
   and other carbohydrate-based polymers, poly-(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)
   polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol homopolymers, a polypropylene
   oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymer, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol) and
15 polyvinyl alcohol, as well as mixtures of these polymers. Particularly preferred
   are polyethylene glycol (PEG)-derivatized proteins. Water-soluble polymers
   may be bonded at specific positions, for example at the amino terminus of the
   proteins and polypeptides according to this disclosure, or randomly attached to
   one or more side chains of the polypeptide. The use of PEG for improving
20 therapeutic capacities is described in US Patent No. 6,133,426.
                   A particular embodiment of this disclosure is an immunoglobulin
   or an Fc fusion protein. Such a fusion protein can have a long half-life, e.g.,
   several hours, a day or more, or even a week or more, especially if the Fc
   domain is capable of interacting with FcRn, the neonatal Fc receptor. The
25 binding site for FcRn in an Fc domain is also the site at which the bacterial
   proteins A and G bind. The tight binding between these proteins can be used
   as a means to purify antibodies or fusion proteins of this disclosure by, for
   example, employing protein A or protein G affinity chromatography during
   protein purification.
30                 Protein purification techniques are well known to those of skill in
   the art. These techniques involve, at one level, the crude fractionation of the
   polypeptide and non-polypeptide fractions. Further purification using
   chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques to achieve partial or complete
   purification (or purification to homogeneity) is frequently desired. Analytical
35 methods particularly suited to the preparation of a pure fusion protein are ion
   exchange chromatography; exclusion chromatography; polyacrylamide gel
                                              52

   electrophoresis; and isoelectric focusing. Particularly efficient methods of
   purifying peptides are fast protein liquid chromatography and HPLC.
                   Certain aspects of the present disclosure concern the purification,
   and in particular embodiments, the substantial purification, of a fusion protein.
 5 The term "purified fusion protein" as used herein, is intended to refer to a
   composition, isolatable from other components, wherein the fusion protein is
   purified to any degree relative to its naturally obtainable state. A purified fusion
   protein therefore also refers to a fusion protein, free from the environment in
   which it may naturally occur.
10                 Generally, "purified" will refer to a fusion protein composition that
   has been subjected to fractionation to remove various other components, and
   which composition substantially retains its expressed biological activity. Where
   the term "substantially purified" is used, this designation refers to a fusion
   binding protein composition in which the fusion protein forms the major
15 component of the composition, such as constituting about 50%, about 60%,
   about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95%, about 99% or more of the
   protein, by weight, in the composition.
                   Various methods for quantifying the degree of purification are
   known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. These
20 include, for example, determining the specific binding activity of an active
   fraction, or assessing the amount of fusion protein in a fraction by SDS/PAGE
   analysis. A preferred method for assessing the purity of a protein fraction is to
   calculate the binding activity of the fraction, to compare it to the binding activity
   of the initial extract, and to thus calculate the degree of purification, herein
25 assessed by a "-fold purification number." The actual units used to represent
   the amount of binding activity will, of course, be dependent upon the particular
   assay technique chosen to follow the purification and whether or not the
   expressed fusion protein exhibits a detectable binding activity.
                   Various techniques suitable for use in protein purification are well
30 known to those of skill in the art. These include, for example, precipitation with
   ammonium sulfate, PEG, antibodies and the like, or by heat denaturation,
   followed by centrifugation; chromatography steps such as ion exchange, gel
   filtration, reverse phase, hydroxylapatite, and affinity chromatography;
   isoelectric focusing; gel electrophoresis; and combinations of these and other
35 techniques. As is generally known in the art, it is believed that the order of
   conducting the various purification steps may be changed, or that certain steps
                                               53

   may be omitted, and still result in a suitable method for the preparation of a
   substantially purified protein.
                  There is no general requirement that the fusion protein always be
   provided in its most purified state. Indeed, it is contemplated that less
 5 substantially purified proteins will have utility in certain embodiments. Partial
   purification may be accomplished by using fewer purification steps in
   combination, or by utilizing different forms of the same general purification
   scheme. For example, it is appreciated that a cation-exchange column
   chromatography performed utilizing an HPLC apparatus will generally result in
10 greater purification than the same technique utilizing a low pressure
   chromatography system. Methods exhibiting a lower degree of relative
   purification may have advantages in total recovery of protein product, or in
   maintaining binding activity of an expressed protein.
                  It is known that the migration of a polypeptide can vary,
15 sometimes significantly, with different conditions of SDS/PAGE (Capaldi et al.
   (1977) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 76:425). It will therefore be appreciated
   that under differing electrophoresis conditions, the apparent molecular weights
   of purified or partially purified fusion protein expression products may vary.
   Polynucleotides, Expression Vectors, and Host Cells
20                This disclosure provides polynucleotides (isolated or purified or
   pure polynucleotides) encoding the multi-specific fusion protein of this
   disclosure, vectors (including cloning vectors and expression vectors)
   comprising such polynucleotides, and cells (e.g., host cells) transformed or
   transfected with a polynucleotide or vector according to this disclosure.
25                In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide (DNA or RNA) encoding
   a binding domain of this disclosure, or a multi-specific fusion protein containing
   one or more such binding domains is contemplated. Expression cassettes
   encoding multi-specific fusion protein constructs are provided in the examples
   appended hereto.
30                The present disclosure also relates to vectors that include a
   polynucleotide of this disclosure and, in particular, to recombinant expression
   constructs. In one embodiment, this disclosure contemplates a vector
   comprising a polynucleotide encoding a multi-specific fusion protein containing
   a CD86 binding domain and an IL-10 agonist, an HLA-G agonist, an HGF
35 agonist, an IL-35 agonist, a PD-1 agonist, a BTLA agonist, a LIGHT antagonist,
                                              54

   a GITRL antagonist or a CD40 antagonist domain of this disclosure, along with
   other polynucleotide sequences that cause or facilitate transcription, translation,
   and processing of such multi-specific fusion protein-encoding sequences.
                  Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with
 5 prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts are described, for example, in Sambrook et
   al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring
   Harbor, NY, (1989). Exemplary cloning/expression vectors include cloning
   vectors, shuttle vectors, and expression constructs, that may be based on
   plasmids, phagemids, phasmids, cosmids, viruses, artificial chromosomes, or
10 any nucleic acid vehicle known in the art suitable for amplification, transfer,
   and/or expression of a polynucleotide contained therein
                  As used herein, "vector" means a nucleic acid molecule capable
   of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. Exemplary
   vectors include plasmids, yeast artificial chromosomes, and viral genomes.
15 Certain vectors can autonomously replicate in a host cell, while other vectors
   can be integrated into the genome of a host cell and thereby are replicated with
   the host genome. In addition, certain vectors are referred to herein as
   "recombinant expression vectors" (or simply, "expression vectors"), which
   contain nucleic acid sequences that are operatively linked to an expression
20 control sequence and, therefore, are capable of directing the expression of
   those sequences.
                  In certain embodiments, expression constructs are derived from
   plasmid vectors. Illustrative constructs include modified pNASS vector
   (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), which has nucleic acid sequences encoding an
25 ampicillin resistance gene, a polyadenylation signal and a T7 promoter site;
   pDEF38 and pNEF38 (CMC ICOS Biologics, Inc.), which have a CHEF1
   promoter; and pD18 (Lonza), which has a CMV promoter. Other suitable
   mammalian expression vectors are well known (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., 1995;
   Sambrook et al., supra; see also, e.g., catalogs from Invitrogen, San Diego, CA;
30 Novagen, Madison, WI; Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). Useful constructs may be
   prepared that include a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-encoding sequence
   under suitable regulatory control, for promoting enhanced production levels of
   the fusion proteins, which levels result from gene amplification following
   application of an appropriate selection agent (e.g., methotrexate).
35                Generally, recombinant expression vectors will include origins of
   replication and selectable markers permitting transformation of the host cell,
                                            55

   and a promoter derived from a highly-expressed gene to direct transcription of a
   downstream structural sequence, as described above. A vector in operable
   linkage with a polynucleotide according to this disclosure yields a cloning or
   expression construct. Exemplary cloning/expression constructs contain at least
 5 one expression control element, e.g., a promoter, operably linked to a
   polynucleotide of this disclosure. Additional expression control elements, such
   as enhancers, factor-specific binding sites, terminators, and ribosome binding
   sites are also contemplated in the vectors and cloning/expression constructs
   according to this disclosure. The heterologous structural sequence of the
10 polynucleotide according to this disclosure is assembled in appropriate phase
   with translation initiation and termination sequences. Thus, for example, the
   fusion protein-encoding nucleic acids as provided herein may be included in
   any one of a variety of expression vector constructs as a recombinant
   expression construct for expressing such a protein in a host cell.
15                 The appropriate DNA sequence(s) may be inserted into a vector,
   for example, by a variety of procedures. In general, a DNA sequence is
   inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease cleavage site(s) by
   procedures known in the art. Standard techniques for cloning, DNA isolation,
   amplification and purification, for enzymatic reactions involving DNA ligase,
20 DNA polymerase, restriction endonucleases and the like, and various
   separation techniques are contemplated. A number of standard techniques are
   described, for example, in Ausubel et al. (Current Protocols in Molecular
   Biology, Greene PubL. Assoc. Inc. & John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Boston, MA,
    1993); Sambrook et al. (Molecular Cloning, Second Ed., Cold Spring Harbor
25 Laboratory, Plainview, NY, 1989); Maniatis et al. (Molecular Cloning, Cold
   Spring Harbor Laboratory, Plainview, NY, 1982); Glover (Ed.) (DNA Cloning
   Vol. I and II, IRL Press, Oxford, UK, 1985); Hames and Higgins (Eds.) (Nucleic
   Acid Hybridization, IRL Press, Oxford, UK, 1985); and elsewhere.
                   The DNA sequence in the expression vector is operatively linked
30 to at least one appropriate expression control sequence (e.g., a constitutive
    promoter or a regulated promoter) to direct mRNA synthesis. Representative
   examples of such expression control sequences include promoters of
   eukaryotic cells or their viruses, as described above. Promoter regions can be
   selected from any desired gene using CAT (chloramphenicol transferase)
35 vectors or other vectors with selectable markers. Eukaryotic promoters include
    CMV immediate early, HSV thymidine kinase, early and late SV40, LTRs from
                                             56

   retrovirus, and mouse metallothionein-. Selection of the appropriate vector and
   promoter is well within the level of ordinary skill in the art, and preparation of
   certain particularly preferred recombinant expression constructs comprising at
   least one promoter or regulated promoter operably linked to a nucleic acid
 5 encoding a protein or polypeptide according to this disclosure is described
   herein.
                  Variants of the polynucleotides of this disclosure are also
   contemplated. Variant polynucleotides are at least 90%, and preferably 95%,
   99%, or 99.9% identical to one of the polynucleotides of defined sequence as
10 described herein, or that hybridizes to one of those polynucleotides of defined
   sequence under stringent hybridization conditions of 0.01 5M sodium chloride,
   0.001 5M sodium citrate at about 65-681C or 0.01 5M sodium chloride, 0.001 5M
   sodium citrate, and 50% formamide at about 420C. The polynucleotide variants
   retain the capacity to encode a binding domain or fusion protein thereof having
15 the functionality described herein.
                  The term "stringent" is used to refer to conditions that are
   commonly understood in the art as stringent. Hybridization stringency is
   principally determined by temperature, ionic strength, and the concentration of
   denaturing agents such as formamide. Examples of stringent conditions for
20 hybridization and washing are 0.015M sodium chloride, 0.0015M sodium citrate
   at about 65-68'C or 0.01 5M sodium chloride, 0.001 5M sodium citrate, and 50%
   formamide at about 420C (see Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A
   Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring
   Harbor, N.Y., 1989).
25                More stringent conditions (such as higher temperature, lower ionic
   strength, higher formamide, or other denaturing agent) may also be used;
   however, the rate of hybridization will be affected. In instances wherein
   hybridization of deoxyoligonucleotides is concerned, additional exemplary
   stringent hybridization conditions include washing in 6x SSC, 0.05% sodium
30 pyrophosphate at 37'C (for 14-base oligonucleotides), 480C (for 17-base
   oligonucleotides), 550C (for 20-base oligonucleotides), and 600C (for 23-base
   oligonucleotides).
                  A further aspect of this disclosure provides a host cell transformed
   or transfected with, or otherwise containing, any of the polynucleotides or
35 vector/expression constructs of this disclosure. The polynucleotides or
   cloning/expression constructs of this disclosure are introduced into suitable
                                             57

   cells using any method known in the art, including transformation, transfection
   and transduction. Host cells include the cells of a subject undergoing ex vivo
   cell therapy including, for example, ex vivo gene therapy. Eukaryotic host cells
   contemplated as an aspect of this disclosure when harboring a polynucleotide,
 5 vector, or protein according to this disclosure include, in addition to a subject's
   own cells (e.g., a human patient's own cells), VERO cells, HeLa cells, Chinese
   hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines (including modified CHO cells capable of
   modifying the glycosylation pattern of expressed multivalent binding molecules,
   see US Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0115614), COS cells (such as
10 COS-7), W138, BHK, HepG2, 3T3, RIN, MDCK, A549, PC12, K562, HEK293
   cells, HepG2 cells, N cells, 3T3 cells, Spodoptera frugiperda cells (e.g., Sf9
   cells), Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, and any other eukaryotic cell known in
   the art to be useful in expressing, and optionally isolating, a protein or peptide
   according to this disclosure. Also contemplated are prokaryotic cells, including
15 Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium, a Streptomycete, or
   any prokaryotic cell known in the art to be suitable for expressing, and
   optionally isolating, a protein or peptide according to this disclosure. In isolating
   protein or peptide from prokaryotic cells, in particular, it is contemplated that
   techniques known in the art for extracting protein from inclusion bodies may be
20 used. The selection of an appropriate host is within the scope of those skilled
   in the art from the teachings herein. Host cells that glycosylate the fusion
   proteins of this disclosure are contemplated.
                   The term "recombinant host cell" (or simply "host cell") refers to a
   cell containing a recombinant expression vector. It should be understood that
25 such terms are intended to refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the
   progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding
   generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny
   may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the
   scope of the term "host cell" as used herein.
30                 Recombinant host cells can be cultured in a conventional nutrient
   medium modified as appropriate for activating promoters, selecting
   transformants, or amplifying particular genes. The culture conditions for
   particular host cells selected for expression, such as temperature, pH and the
   like, will be readily apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan. Various
35 mammalian cell culture systems can also be employed to express recombinant
   protein. Examples of mammalian expression systems include the COS-7 lines
                                             58

   of monkey kidney fibroblasts, described by Gluzman (1981) Cell 23:175, and
   other cell lines capable of expressing a compatible vector, for example, the
   C127, 3T3, CHO, HeLa and BHK cell lines. Mammalian expression vectors will
   comprise an origin of replication, a suitable promoter and, optionally, enhancer,
 5 and also any necessary ribosome binding sites, polyadenylation site, splice
   donor and acceptor sites, transcriptional termination sequences, and 5'-flanking
   nontranscribed sequences, for example, as described herein regarding the
   preparation of multivalent binding protein expression constructs. DNA
   sequences derived from the SV40 splice, and polyadenylation sites may be
10 used to provide the required nontranscribed genetic elements. Introduction of
   the construct into the host cell can be effected by a variety of methods with
   which those skilled in the art will be familiar, including calcium phosphate
   transfection, DEAE-Dextran-mediated transfection, or electroporation (Davis et
   al. (1986) Basic Methods in Molecular Biology).
15                In one embodiment, a host cell is transduced by a recombinant
   viral construct directing the expression of a protein or polypeptide according to
   this disclosure. The transduced host cell produces viral particles containing
   expressed protein or polypeptide derived from portions of a host cell membrane
   incorporated by the viral particles during viral budding.
20 Compositions and Methods of Use
                  To treat human or non-human mammals suffering a disease state
   associated with CD86, IL-10, HLA-G, IL-35, PD-1, BTLA, LIGHT, GITRL or
   CD40 dysregulation, a multi-specific fusion protein of this disclosure is
   administered to the subject in an amount that is effective to ameliorate
25 symptoms of the disease state following a course of one or more
   administrations. Being polypeptides, the multi-specific fusion proteins of this
   disclosure can be suspended or dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable
   diluent, optionally including a stabilizer of other pharmaceutically acceptable
   excipients, which can be used for intravenous administration by injection or
30 infusion, as more fully discussed below.
                  A pharmaceutically effective dose is that dose required to prevent,
   inhibit the occurrence of, or treat (alleviate a symptom to some extent,
   preferably all symptoms of) a disease state. The pharmaceutically effective
   dose depends on the type of disease, the composition used, the route of
35 administration, the type of subject being treated, the physical characteristics of
                                              59

   the specific subject under consideration for treatment, concurrent medication,
   and other factors that those skilled in the medical arts will recognize. For
   example, an amount between 0.1 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg body weight (which
   can be administered as a single dose, or in multiple doses given hourly, daily,
 5 weekly, monthly, or any combination thereof that is an appropriate interval) of
   active ingredient may be administered depending on the potency of a binding
   domain polypeptide or multi-specific protein fusion of this disclosure.
                   In certain aspects, compositions of fusion proteins are provided by
   this disclosure. Pharmaceutical compositions of this disclosure generally
10 comprise one or more type of binding domain or fusion protein in combination
   with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient, or diluent. Such carriers
   will be nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed.
    Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for therapeutic use are well known in the
    pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's
15  Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A.R. Gennaro (Ed.) 1985). For
   example, sterile saline and phosphate buffered saline at physiological pH may
    be used. Preservatives, stabilizers, dyes and the like may be provided in the
    pharmaceutical composition. For example, sodium benzoate, sorbic acid, or
   esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid may be added as preservatives. Id. at 1449.
20  In addition, antioxidants and suspending agents may be used. Id. The
    compounds of the present invention may be used in either the free base or salt
   forms, with both forms being considered as being within the scope of the
    present invention.
                   Pharmaceutical compositions may also contain diluents such as
25  buffers; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, low molecular weight (less than
    about 10 residues) polypeptides, proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates (e.g.,
    glucose, sucrose, or dextrins), chelating agents (e.g., EDTA), glutathione or
    other stabilizers or excipients. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with
    nonspecific serum albumin are exemplary appropriate diluents. Preferably,
30  product is formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipient solutions as
    diluents.
                   Compositions of this disclosure can be used to treat disease
    states in human and non-human mammals that are a result of or associated
    with CD86, IL-10, HLA-G, IL-35, PD-1, BTLA, LIGHT, GITRL or CD40
35  dysregulation. As discussed above, blocking of binding of CD86 to CD28, for
    example by administration of CTLA41g, has been shown to be effective in
                                             60

   treating autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis. IL10 is known to
   have immunosuppressive properties (Commins et al. (2008) J. Allergy Clin.
   Immunol. 121:1108-11; Ming et al., (2008) Immunity 28:468-476), and
   beneficial responses have been seen following administration of IL1 0 to
 5 patients with psoriasis (Asadullah et al. (1999) Arch. Dermatol. 135:187-92) and
   inflammatory bowel disease (Schreiber et al. (2000) Gastroenterology
    119:1461-72). As noted above, it has been suggested that HLA-G may be
   useful in reducing inflammatory responses in the CNS associated with multiple
   sclerosis (Wiendl et al. (2005) Blood, 128:2689-2704), and as a therapeutic
10 agent in promoting tolerance to grafts in transplantations (Carosella et al.
   (2008) Blood 111:4862-4870). HGF has been shown to be effective in reducing
   disease both in a mouse model of arthritis and in a mouse model of asthma.
    IL35 has been shown to be effective in reducing disease in a mouse model of
   arthritis and to suppress T-cell proliferation. As discussed above, LIGHT
15 antagonists have been shown to be effective in reducing graft vs. host disease
   and to suppress T-cell proliferation. In addition, LIGHT is believed to play a role
   in inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn's disease. PD1-L1 or PD1-L2 to PD
    1 has been shown to be effective in reducing T-cell activation and cytokine
   production. BTLA has been shown to be effective in reducing T-cell activation
20 and cytokine production. Binding of GITRL to GITR has been shown to
   increase disease severity in animal models of asthma and arthritis, and is
    known to increase T cell inflammatory and immune responses. As discussed
   above, CD40 signaling is involved in diseases such as autoimmune diseases,
   cancers, and organ and tissue graft rejections.
25                Thus, multi-specific fusion proteins of this disclosure are useful in
   treating various autoimmune and/or inflammatory disorders, such as
    rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, systemic lupus
   erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease
   and ulcerative colitis), graft versus host disease, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis,
30 dermatomyositis, polymyositis, pernicious anaemia, primary biliary cirrhosis,
   acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Addison's disease, ankylosing
   spondylitis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) autoimmune hepatitis,
   diabetes mellitus type 1, Goodpasture's syndrome, Graves' disease, Guillain
    Barr6 syndrome (GBS), Hashimoto's disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic
35  purpura, lupus erythematosus, pemphigus vulgaris, Sj6gren's syndrome,
   temporal arteritis (also known as "giant cell arteritis"), autoimmune hemolytic
                                             61

   anemia, bullous pemphigoid, vasculitis, coeliac disease, endometriosis,
   hidradenitis suppurativa, interstitial cystitis, morphea, scleroderma, narcolepsy,
   neuromyotonia, vitiligo and autoimmune inner ear disease. In addition, multi
   specific fusion proteins of this disclosure are useful in suppressing detrimental
 5 immune alloresponse in organ transplant (including solid organ transplant or
   allograft), cell transplant, or the like.
                    "Pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to a salt of a binding
   domain polypeptide or fusion protein of this disclosure that is pharmaceutically
   acceptable and that possesses the desired pharmacological activity of the
10 parent compound. Such salts include the following: (1) acid addition salts,
   formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid,

                                       EXAMPLES
   Xceptor Sequences
                  Nucleotide expression cassettes and amino acid sequences of
   exemplary multi-specific fusion proteins having a CTLA4 ectodomain are
 5 provided in SEQ ID NOS:8, 12, 16, 23, 27, 30, 34, 37 and 41 and SEQ ID
   NOS:9, 13, 17, 24, 28, 31, 35, 38, and 42, respectively. The activity of these
   exemplary multi-specific fusion proteins was tested as described in Examples
   1-6 below. Abbreviations used in the following examples include the following
   terms: PBS-T: PBS, pH 7.2-7.4 and 0.1% Tween@20; Working buffer: PBS-T
10 with 1% BSA; Blocking buffer: PBS-T with 3% BSA.
                                       EXAMPLE 1
                               ANTI-CD86 BINDING DOMAINS
                  Hybridomas 3D1 and FUN1 were used to clone the anti-CD86
   variable binding domains of these monoclonal antibodies. The sequences for
15 the heavy chain, light chain, scFv linker, and CDRs from the FUN1 and 3D1
   anti-CD86 monoclonal antibodies are found in SEQ NOS:305-313 and 318-326,
    respectively.
                  The following humanized FUN1 anti-CD86 monoclonal antibody
   variable binding domains were used to construct SMIP proteins and xceptors.
20 The FUN1 CDRs were grafted into human germline sequences as follows: (1)
    FUN1-11 has lgkv4-1*01 FR for light chain and IgHV1-F*01 FR for heavy chain;
   (2) FUN1-21 has lgkv4-1*01 FR for light chain and IgHV1-2*02 FR for heavy
   chain; (3) FUN1-31 has lgkv4-1*01 FR for light chain and IgHV3-1 1*01 FR for
    heavy chain; (4) FUN1-12 has lgkv1-27*01 FR for light chain and lgHV1-F*01
25  FR for heavy chain; (5) FUN1-22 has lgkv1-27*01 FR for light chain and IgHV1
   2*02 FR for heavy chain; and (6) FUN1-32 has lgkv1-27*01 FR for light chain
    and IgHV3-1 1*01 FR for heavy chain. The germline CDRs for the humanized
    molecules are similar to the original FUN1 molecules.
                   Consequently, six versions of humanized FUN1 SMIP proteins
30 were also generated as follows: (1) FUN1-11 (SEQ ID NO:225); (2) FUN1-21
    (SEQ ID NO:227); (3) FUN1-31 (SEQ ID NO:229); (4) FUN1-12 (SEQ ID
    NO:231); (5) FUN1-22 (SEQ ID NO:233); and (6) FUN1-32 (SEQ ID NO:235).
    Binding activity of these humanized FUN1 SMP molecules is shown in Figure
                                            66

   7. In addition, the FUN1 variable domains (scFv) and humanized FUN1 scFv
   were used to make xceptors, such as IL10::FUN1 (SEQ ID NO:183);
   FUN1::IL10 (SEQ ID NO:187); FUN1-21::lL10 (SEQ ID NO:237); IL10::FUN1
   21 (SEQ ID NO:254); IL10 187A::FUN1-21 (SEQ ID NO:258); and
 5 monoIL10::FUN1-21 binding domain was also made using a short A2 hinge
   (SEQ ID NO:276) (wherein the A2 hinge amino acid sequence is set forth in
   SEQ ID NO:364).
                  These, and all the other constructs described herein, were cloned
   into appropriate mammalian expression vectors and expressed in various cell
10 lines to produce protein for particular functional assays.
                                        EXAMPLE 2
                        XCEPTOR BINDING TO IL10-R1 BY BIACORETM
                  IL1 0-R1 binding activity was examined for an Xceptor including a
   CTLA4 ectodomain and an IL10 domain (SEQ ID NO:9), substantially as
15 follows.
                  Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were
   performed on a BlAcoreTM T100 SPR (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala) using
   HBS-P+ (GE Healthcare) as a running buffer. IL-1OR1 (25 ptg/mL in 10 mM
   sodium acetate, pH 4.0; R&D Systems) was directly immobilized onto a CM5
20 chip using standard amine coupling chemistry (Biacore Amine Coupling Kit, GE
   Healthcare), with final immobilization levels of 867, 2687, and 6719 Ru
   (resonance units). IL-10-containing constructs were injected for 300 seconds,
   at a flow rate of 50 pl/min, in a series of concentrations from 100 pM to 10 nM.
   Dissociation was monitored for 1200 seconds, and the surface was regenerated
25 by injecting 2 M magnesium chloride, pH 7.58, for 60 seconds, followed by
   injecting 20 mM EDTA (in HBS-P+) for 60 seconds. Binding interactions with
   the surface were stable through at least 30 regeneration cycles. Data were
   analyzed using BiaEvaluation for the T1 00, version 2.0 (GE Healthcare).
   Binding kinetics of the CTLA4/IL10 Xceptor to immobilized IL-10R1 could not be
30 fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, but could be fit with high accuracy to a
   bivalent analyte binding model. Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) could be
   calculated with high accuracy for each construct by fitting the observed
   response at saturation to a steady-state equilibrium model, and are provided
   below in Table 3. Inclusion of the CTLA4 ectodomain in the Xceptor fusion
35 protein had no apparent effect on the IL10/l1OR1 interaction.

               XCEPTOR BINDING TO CD80 AND BOTH CD80 AND ILl 0 BY ELISA
                   CD80 and ILl OR binding activity was examined by ELISA for
   abatacept, a CTLA4-Ig construct referred to as CTLA4-N2 (SEQ ID NO: 10 and
   11), and the CTLA4/IL1 0 Xceptor of SEQ ID NO: 9, substantially as follows.
10 CD80 Binding
                   Each well of a 96-well black Maxisorp CD80 plate (Nunc Catalog
   #437111) plate was coated with CD80-mIg (Ancell Catalog #510-020) at
   2 pg/ml solution and incubated overnight at 40C. The plate was then blocked
   with Blocking Buffer (PBS-T with 3% non-fat dry milk). Samples of the proteins
15 to be tested serially diluted Blocking Buffer were added in duplicate wells to the
   CD80-mIg coated plate, the plate was covered, and incubated at room
   temperature for about 1 hour. After washing, 100 pi per well horse radish
   peroxidase goat anti-human IgG (gamma) diluted 1:1,000 in Blocking Buffer
   was added, the plate was covered, and incubated at room temperature for 60
20 minutes, followed by a 10 minute incubation at room temperature in
   QuantaBluTM Fluorogenic Peroxidase Substrate (Thermo Scientific Catolog
   #15169). The absorbance of each well was read at 420 nm. The unrelated
   fusion protein TRU-015 was employed as a negative control.
                   The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 1. CTLA4
25 N2 was found to bind as well as abatacept to CD80-mIg in this ELISA format,
   while the CTLA4/IL1 0 Xceptor appeared to show weaker CD80 binding.

   Xceptor Binding to both sIL1 OR1 and sCD80
                  Each well of a 96-well black Maxisorp CD80 plate (Nunc Catalog
   #437111) plate was coated with siL1 ORa (R&D Systems Catalog #510-020) at
   2 pg/ml solution and incubated overnight at 41C. The plate was then blocked
 5 with Blocking Buffer (PBS-T with 3% non-fat dry milk). Samples of the proteins
   to be tested serially diluted Blocking Buffer were added in duplicate wells to the
   siL1 ORa coated plate, the plate was covered, and incubated at room
   temperature for about 1 hour. After washing, anti-CD1 52 antibody (Ancell
   #359-020) at 1Ong/ul or CD80-mIg (Ancell # 510-020) at 5 ug/ml was added
10 followed by horse radish peroxidase goat anti-mouse igG (Fc) (Pierce #31439)
   diluted 1:10,000 in Blocking Buffer was added, the plate was covered, and
   incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes, followed by a 10 minute
   incubation at room temperature in QuantaBluTM Fluorogenic Peroxidase
   Substrate (Thermo Scientific Catolog #15169). The absorbance of each well
15 was read at 420 nm. The unrelated fusion protein TRU-015 was employed as a
   negative control.
                  Figure 2 shows the results obtained for CTLA4-N2 and the
   CTLA4::iL10 xceptor of SEQ ID NO: 9. These results demonstrate that both
   the CTLA4 and IL10 domains of the CTLA4-Ig-IL10 Xceptor are able to bind to
20 their ligand/receptor simultaneously.
                                       EXAMPLE 4
                      XCEPTOR INDUCED STAT3 PHOSPHORYLATION
                  Binding of IL10 to IL10-R1 is known to activate Jak-1 and Tyk
   which in turn lead to activation of STAT3 (see, for example, Williams et al.
25 (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282:6965-6975). In addition, studies have demonstrated
   that flow cytometry may be employed to study the phosphorylation of STAT3 in
   PBMC (Lafarge et al. (2007) BMC Mol. Biol. 8:64). The ability of various IL1 0
   containing constructs, including the CTLA4/IL1 0 Xceptor of SEQ ID NO: 9, to
   induce phosphorylation of STAT3 in human PBMC was examined substantially
30 as follows.
                  PBMCs were isolated from a human donor and cultured overnight
   in complete media (RPMI, 10% FBS, pen/strep) at 2x10 6 cells/ml. The following
   morning, the PBMCs were washed once, resuspended with pre-warmed RPMI
   1640 (no supplements) at 4x1 06 cells/ml and incubated at 371C for 2.5hrs.
35 Treatments were prepared at a 2X concentration in 0.25mL of RPMI 1640 and
                                            69

   mixed with 1x106 PBMCs in 0.25mL of RPMI 1640. The samples were then
   incubated for 15min at 37 0 C. Upon completion of the 15min incubation, 0.5mL
   of ice cold BD Cytofix Buffer (BD Biosciences, cat #554655) was added to each
   tube. Cells were incubated on ice for 30min and then washed with 2mls of
 5 DPBS+2.5% FBS (FACS Buffer). After decanting and vortexing the samples,
   0.5mL of ice cold BD PERM BUFFER III (BD Biosciences, cat # 558050) was
   added to each tube and the samples were then incubated on ice for 30min.
   Samples were washed 3X with 2mL of FACS Buffer, and resuspended in
   -0.2mL of FACS buffer after the final wash. 20uL of FITC conjugated anti
10 Human STAT3 mAb (BD Biosciences, clone PY705) was added to each
   sample. Cells were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30min.
   Samples were then washed 3X with FACS Buffer to remove any unbound
   antibody. Samples were analyzed on a LSRII flow cytometer. A gate was
   applied to live lymphocytes based on SSC and FSC profiles and MFI for FITC
15 was determined.
                  As shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, all IL-10 containing constructs
   increased STAT3 phosphorylation in a dose dependent fashion.
                                      EXAMPLE 5
                  XCEPTOR BINDING TO   CD86 AND BOTH CD86 AND IL10
20                A human B-lymphoblastoid cell line that expresses CD86
   (WIL2-S) was used to examine CD86 binding, and a CHO cell line expressing
   CD86 (HuCD86-2A2 cells) on the surface was used in combination with soluble
    IL10 Receptorl (IL1 0R1) fusion protein linked to a murine IgG Fc or an anti
    IL10 antibody to examine the simultaneous binding of the CD86 antagonist and
25  IL10 agonist found on xceptor molecules. Briefly, WIL2-S or HuCD86-2A2 cells
   were incubated with test molecules containing a CD86 antagonist at
   concentrations ranging from saturation to background levels. To the HuCD86
   2A2 cells, an IL1 OR1 -mulg fusion protein or a murine anti-IL1 0 antibody was
   further added to form a complex with the test molecules that had bound to the
30 cell surface via CD86. After the incubation, cells were washed and a
   fluorophore (R-phycoerythrin) tagged F(Ab') 2 antibody specific for the Fc portion
   of the xceptor molecule, IL1 OR-Ig fusion protein, or anti-IL1 0 antibody. The
   tagged cells were then passed through a flow cytometer and data was analyzed
    by plotting median fluorescence intensity of each sample.
                                           70

                  As shown in Figure 5, binding to CD86 on WIL2-S cells by xceptor
   molecules containing an anti-CD86 binding domain (e.g., from hybridoma
   antibodies 3D1 and FUN1) showed higher affinity than binding of CTLA4
   ectodomain containing xceptor molecules. More specifically, anti-CD86 3D1
 5 containing xceptor 3Dl::L10 (SEQ ID NO:189) had slightly higher affinity to
   CD86 than anti-CD86 FUN1 containing xceptor FUN1::IL10 (SEQ ID NO:187),
   whereas CTLA4-Ig (SEQ ID NO:1 1) and a CTLA4 containing xceptor (SEQ ID
   NO:173) had much lower affinity for CD86 than the anti-CD86 binding domains
   from hybridoma antibodies 3D1 and FUN1.
10                 As shown in Figure 6, xceptor molecules containing a CD86
   antagonist and IL10 agonist could simultaneously bind CD86 on HuCD86-2A2
   cells (CHO cells expressing CD86 on cell surface developed in house) and
   soluble IL1OR1. Furthermore, Figure 6 shows that the IL10 variants had
   different binding affinities for IL10R1. For example, the xceptor molecules
15 CTLA4::monolL10 (SEQ ID NO:181) and (CTLA4::IL10)-75 (SEQ ID NO:173)
   had similar affinities for IL10R1, but the xceptors containing the viral mutated
   IL10 form, CTLA4::IL10187A (SEQ ID NO:191) and CTLA4::IL10187S (SEQ ID
   NO:193), showed much lower affinity for IL10R1.
                   In another experiment, different versions of humanized FUN1
20 SMIPs were tested for CD86 binding. Supernatants of HEK293 cells transiently
   transfected with the six different versions of humanized FUN1 SMIPs were
   examined for CD86 binding using HuCD86-2A2 cells. Figure 7 shows that that
    FUN1-21 (SEQ ID NO:227) had the best binding affinity to CD86 followed by
    FUN1-22 (SEQ ID NO:233) and then FUN1-11 (SEQ ID NO:225); the remaining
25 humanized FUN1 SMIP proteins (FUN1-12, SEQ ID NO:229; FUN1-31, SEQ ID
    NO:231; FUN1-32, SEQ ID NO:235) did not show detectable binding.

             VARYING BINDING DOMAIN LINKER LENGTHS IN XCEPTOR PROTEINS
                   Linker stability for CTLA4::IL10 molecules was examined. All
30  linker variants were stably transfected in CHOK1 SV cells and stable bulk
    populations were cultured at 370C and shifted to 340C on day 3. Proteins were
    purified by Protein A column and followed by second step SEC column. ELISA
    assays were performed to measure the IL10 binding to IL10R1-mig fusion
    protein. The results in Figure 8 showed that xceptor (CTLA4::IL10)-65 (SEQ ID
35  NO:9) had reduced IL10 binding due to instability of the linker, but
                                             71

   (CTLA4::IL10)-68 (SEQ ID NO:171), (CTLA4::IL10)-69 (SEQ ID NO:302), and
   (CTLA4::IL10)-75 (SEQ ID NO:173) were stable in these culture conditions.
                  Shorter linker variants were also tested in CTLA4::IL10 xceptor
   proteins for binding to IL1 OR1 by ELISA. The shorter linker variants were
 5 transiently transfected and proteins were Protein A column purified. ELISA
   assays were performed to measure the IL10 binding to IL1OR1-mig fusion
   protein. The results in Figure 9 showed that the shorter linker variants
   (CTLA4::IL10)-77 (SEQ ID NO:175), Q0033 (CTLA4::IL10)-78 (SEQ ID
   NO:177), and (CTLA4::IL10)-79 (SEQ ID NO:179) worked as well as the longer
10 linkers for back end IL10 binding affinity (e.g., compared to (CTLA4::IL10)-68;
   SEQ ID NO:171).

             SERUM STABILITY AND PHARMACOKINETICS OF XCEPTOR PROTEINS
                  The serum stability of (CTLA4::IL10)-75 (SEQ ID NO:173) was
15 tested. In this experiment, purified protein of SEQ ID NO:1 73 was treated in
   mouse serum at 37 0C for 24 hours, 72 hours and F/T (freeze/thaw) and spike in
   at the time of assay (TO). All stability samples were tested for their binding to
   CD80 (using CD80 expressing 1F6 CHO cells) as well as for simultaneous
   binding to CD80 and anti-IL10 antibody binding to IL10 on the xceptor. The
20  results showed that SEQ ID NO:173 was very stable and retained anti-IL10
    binding after incubation in mouse serum at the tested concentrations (from
   about 0.01nM to about 1OnM).
                   Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies for (CTLA4::IL10)-68 (SEQ ID
    NO:171) and (CTLA4::IL10)-75 (SEQ ID NO:173) were conducted in female
25  Balb/c mice, using 3 mice per time point. Mice were injected intravenously with
   200 pg/mouse. Mouse serum was collected at 15 minutes, 2 hours, 6 hours, 24
    hours, 48 hours, 96 hours, 7 days and 14 days after treatment. Samples were
   tested for CD80 binding (CTLA4 assay) and simultaneous binding to CD80 and
   anti-IL10 antibody (IL10 assay). The results are summarized in Table 4 below.

                      XCEPTOR BINDING TO CD80, CD86 AND IL1 OR1
                  CD80 and IL10R1 binding was examined by ELISA, and/or CD86
 5 and IL10R1 binding was examined using CD86-expressing CHO cells and
   either IL10R1-Ig or anti-IL10. Binding to mouse CD80 and CD86 was
   examined by ELISA using biotin-labeled mouse antibodies. The molecules
   examined included the control CTLA4-Ig (SEQ ID NO:1 1) fusion protein, and
   the following test xceptor molecules: (CTLA4::IL10)-65 (SEQ ID NO:9);
10 (CTLA4::IL10)-68 (SEQ ID NO:171); (CTLA4::IL10)-69 (SEQ ID NO:302),
   (CTLA4::PDL2)-65 (SEQ ID NO:336), substantially as described in Examples 3
   and 5.
                  As shown in Figures 10 and 11, the (CTLA4::IL10)-65,
   (CTLA4::IL10)-68, and (CTLA4::1L10)-69 xceptor molecules all bound CD80 by
15 ELISA and CD86 on cells. The results in Figure 12 show that CTLA4::IL10
   xceptor molecules can interact with hulL10R1. Further, as shown in Figure 13,
   CTLA4::IL10 xceptors can engage both BD1 (amino-terminal binding domain)
   and BD2 (carboxy-terminal binding domain) simultaneously to CD80 and
    IL1OR1 by ELISA. Additionally, Figures 14 and 15 show that the
20 (CTLA4::lL10)-65, (CTLA4::IL10)-68, and (CTLA4::IL10)-69 xceptor molecules,
   specific for human molecules, are capable of crossreacting with both mouse
   CD80 and mouse CD86.

                         XCEPTOR BINDING TO CD80 BY BIACORET M
                  CD80 binding activity was examined for abatacept (Orencia@,
   Bristol-Myers Squibb), a CTLA4-Fc fusion containing the L104E A29Y
 5 mutations, analogous to belatacept (SEQ ID NO:217), three CTLA4::lL10
   xceptor linker variants each having a CTLA4 ectodomain and an IL10 domain:
   (CTLA4::IL10)-65 (SEQ ID NO:9), (CTLA4::IL10)-68 (SEQ ID NO:171), and
   (CTLA4::lL10)-75 (SEQ ID NO:173); an xceptor including a CTLA4 ectodomain
   with the L104E A29Y mutations and an IL10 domain (SEQ ID NO:219), and an
10 xceptor containing a CTLA4 ectodomain and a PD-L1 domain (SEQ ID NO:13),
   substantially as described herein. Examination of binding of CTLA4-Fc to
   CD80/86 by BlAcore has been described previously (Greene et al. (1996) J.
   Biol. Chem. 271:26762-26771; van der Merwe et al. (1997) J. Exp. Med.
   185:393-403; Collins et al. (2002) Immunity 17:201-210). Binding of CD80 by
15 CTLA4 is of moderate affinity (Kd = -200 nM), and is characterized by a fast on
   rate (4-8x105 M-'s-1 ) and a moderate off rate (0.090 s1). Binding of dimeric
   CTLA4-Fc to CD80 is biphasic, and has been reported with two off-rates (0.004,
   0.086 s-1). The L104E A29Y mutations on CTLA4-Fc have been reported to
   increase the affinity for CD80 two-fold over the wild type CTLA4-Fc (Larsen et
20 al (2005) Am. J. Transplant. 5:443-453), primarily by decreasing the initial off
   rate (reported as 0.00108 vs 0.00221 s1).
                  Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were
   performed on a BlAcoreTM T100 SPR (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala) using
    HBS-EP+ (GE Healthcare) as a running buffer. CD80-mIgG (25 pg/mL in 10
25 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0; Ancell, Inc) was directly immobilized onto a CM5
   chip using standard amine coupling chemistry (Biacore Amine Coupling Kit, GE
    Healthcare), with final immobilization levels of 317, 973, and 1678 Ru
   (resonance units). CTLA4-containing constructs were injected for 150 seconds,
   at a flow rate of 10 pl/min, in a series of concentrations from 5 nM to 1 pM.
30  Dissociation was monitored for 600 seconds, and the surface was regenerated
    by injecting 50 mM sodium citrate, 500 mM sodium chloride, pH 4.0, for 60
    seconds. Binding interactions with the surface were stable through at least 75
    regeneration cycles. Data were analyzed using BiaEvaluation for the T1 00
    software (version 2.0.1, GE Healthcare).
35                Binding kinetics of the CTLA4 constructs to immobilized CD80
    could not be fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, but could be fit with high
                                             74

  accuracy to a bivalent analyte binding model. Increasing the association phase
  by increasing the length of injection did not alter the calculated kinetic
  parameters. Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) could be calculated with
  high accuracy for each construct by fitting the observed response at saturation
5 to a steady-state equilibrium model. The results for all CD80 binding molecules
  are summarized in Table 5 below.

                  Equilibrium affinities for the Xceptors were determined to
   resemble that for abatacept and the reported affinity for CTLA4-Fc (200 nM;
   Greene et al. 1996, Ibid). Binding kinetics for the CTLA4::PDL1 xceptor were
   different from those for abatacept or the CTLA4::IL10 xceptor, although the
 5 on/off rate compensation gives a similar affinity. This may be due to the fact
   that PD-L1 binds CD80 with a weaker affinity than CTLA4 (KD of 2.5 pM).
   Similar to previous studies, CTLA4 variants containing the Li 04E A29Y
   mutation (SEQ ID NOS:217 and 219) had a higher affinity for CD80, with a
   roughly two fold improvement in initial off rate (0.00373 s1 for SEQ ID NO:217
10 as compared to 0.006 s-1 for abatacept).
                                        EXAMPLE 10
                         XCEPTOR BINDING TO     CD86 BY BIAcORET M
                  CD86 binding activity was examined for abatacept, a CTLA4-Fc
   fusion containing the L104E A29Y mutations, analogous to belatacept (SEQ ID
15 NO:217), an xceptor containing a CTLA4 ectodomain and an IL10 domain
   (SEQ ID NO: 9), an xceptor containing a CTLA4 ectodomain with the L104E
   A29Y mutations and an 10 domain (SEQ ID NO:219), and different constructs
   (SMIP, PIMS, and xceptor) containing antibody variable domains from the 3D1
   and FUN1 anti-CD86 antibodies, substantially as described herein. Binding of
20 CD86 by CTLA4 is of low affinity (Kd = -2.2 pM), and is characterized by a fast
   on rate (2-13x105 M- 1s-1 ) and a moderate off rate (0.42 s-1). The L104E A29Y
   mutations on CTLA4-Fc have been reported to increase the affinity for CD86
   four-fold over the wild type CTLA4-Fc (Larsen et al (2005) Am. J. Transplant.
   5:443-453), primarily by decreasing the initial off-rate (reported as 0.00206 vs
25 0.00816 s-1). Apparently, no kinetic or equilibrium affinity data has been
   previously published for the 3D1 or FUN1 antibodies, so their relative affinities
   were determined.
                  Lower-affinity CD86 binding domains based on the CTLA4
   ectodomain. SPR measurements were performed on a BlAcoreTM T100 SPR
30 (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala) using HBS-EP+ (GE Healthcare) as a
   running buffer. CD86-migG (25 tg/mL in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0,
   Ancell, Inc) was directly immobilized onto a CM5 chip using standard amine
   coupling chemistry (Biacore Amine Coupling Kit, GE Healthcare), with final
   immobilization levels of 37, 373, and 903 Ru. CTLA4-containing constructs
35 were injected for 150 seconds, at a flow rate of 10 pl/min, in a series of
                                               77

   concentrations from 4 nM to 10 pM. Dissociation was monitored for 600
   seconds, and the surface was either regenerated by injecting 50 mM sodium
   citrate, 500 mM sodium chloride, pH 5.0, for 60 seconds (wild type CTLA4) or
   10 mM glycine, pH 1.7 (L1 04E A29Y CTLA4). Binding interactions with the
 5 surface, and immobilization levels, were stable through at least 100
   regeneration cycles. Data were analyzed using BiaEvaluation for the T1 00
   software (version 2.0.1, GE Healthcare). Owing to the low affinity of CTLA4 to
   CD86, and the very fast on and off rates (literature values are 0.2-1.3x1 06
   M-'s-1 for ka and 0.42 s-1 for kd, at the limit of detection for the BlAcoreTM T1 00
10 instrument) binding kinetics of abatacept to immobilized CD86 could not be
   determined. Binding kinetics of the constructs with the L104E A29Y CTLA4
   domain (SEQ ID NO:217; SEQ ID NO:219) to immobilized CD86 could be
   determined with reasonable accuracy by fitting the observed response to the
   bivalent analyte model, however. Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) could
15 be calculated with high accuracy for all constructs by fitting the observed
   response at saturation to a steady-state equilibrium model. The results are
   shown in Table 6, below.
                  Higher-affinity CD86 binding domains based on the 3D1 and
   FUNI antibody variable domains. SPR measurements were performed as
20 listed above, with the following exceptions: HBS-P+ (GE Healthcare) was used
   as a running buffer; dissociation was monitored for 1200 seconds; and the
   surface was regenerated by injecting 10 mM glycine, pH 1.7, for 60 seconds.
   Binding kinetics to immobilized CD86 could be determined in all cases.
    However, equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) could be calculated with high
25 accuracy for each construct by fitting the observed response at saturation to a
   steady-state equilibrium model. The results are shown in Table 6 below.

                  Equilibrium affinities for abatacept (3.2 pM) resembled the
   reported affinity for CTLA4-Fc (2.2 pM; Greene et al. 1996, Ibid). Similar to
   previous studies, CTLA4 variants containing the L104E A29Y mutation (SEQ ID
   NO:217; SEQ ID NO:219) had a four-to-five fold higher affinity for CD86 (670
 5 772 nM). Constructs containing 3D1 murine single-chain antibody fragments
   (scFvs) on the N-terminus (3D1 SMIP, SEQ ID NO: 317; 3D1::IL10, SEQ ID
   NO:189) had higher affinities (11.7, 26.5 nM) than the corresponding constructs
   with the 3D1 scFv on the C-terminus (3D1 PIMS, SEQ ID NO: 319; IL10::3D1,
   SEQ ID NO:185); examining the binding kinetics, this appeared to arise from
10 both a higher initial on-rate and a lower initial-off rate, although in all cases, the
   affinity was at least 100-fold higher for CD86 than abatacept. For the FUN1
   antibody, the parent murine monoclonal antibody was examined along with
   SMIP proteins containing two humanized single-chain FUN1 antibody
   fragments (SEQ ID NOS:225 and 227); the latter of the two (SEQ ID NO:227)
15 showed similar binding kinetics and overall affinity to CD86 as the parent FUN1
   mAb (26.9, 36 nM, respectively), which, again, was significantly higher than that
   of abatacept. Xceptor or PIMS molecules containing humanized FUN1
   antibody fragments at the carboxy-terminus (IL10::FUN1-21, SEQ ID NO: 254;
   (IL10 187A:: FUN1-21)-75, SEQ ID NO:258; (monolL10-A2 hinge:: FUN1-21)
20 75, (SEQ ID NO:276); FUN1-21 PIMS, SEQ ID NO:402) had lower affinities
   than the xceptor containing the parent antibody sequence at the amino
   terminus (FUN1::IL10, SEQ ID NO:187)) or the same FUN1-21 binding
   sequence on a SMIP protein (SEQ ID NO:227).

25                   XCEPTOR BINDING TO MURINE CD86 BY BIACORETIM
                  Murine CD86 binding activity was examined for abatacept, a
   CTLA4-Fc fusion containing the Li 04E A29Y mutations, analogous to
   belatacept (SEQ ID NO:217), two xceptors containing different BD2 linkers but
   the same CTLA4 and IL10 domains (SEQ ID NOS:171 and 173), an xceptor
30 containing a CTLA4 ectodomain with the L104E A29Y mutations and an ILl0
   domain (SEQ ID NO:219), a murine CTLA4 fusion to human Fc domain (SEQ
    ID NO:404), and different constructs containing antibody variable domains from
   the rat GL1 anti-murine CD86 antibody, including two xceptors containing a
   GL1 antibody fragment and human IL10 domain (GL1::IL10, SEQ ID NO:252;
35 and IL10::GL1, SEQ ID NO:256), substantially as described below. Human
                                              80

   CTLA4 is known to be cross-reactive to murine CD86, but, to the best of our
   knowledge, no kinetic or affinity measurements have been previously
   described. Similarly, the rat GL1 antibody has been described as being specific
   for murine CD86, but no kinetic or affinity measurements have been reported.
 5                SPR measurements were performed on a BlAcoreTM T1 00 SPR
   (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala) using HBS-EP+ (GE Healthcare) as a
   running buffer. Murine CD86-mIgG (25 pg/mL in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH
   4.0, R&D Systems, Inc) was directly immobilized onto a CM5 chip using
   standard amine coupling chemistry (Biacore Amine Coupling Kit, GE
10 Healthcare), with final immobilization levels of 150, 493, and 746 Ru. CTLA4
   containing constructs were injected for 150 seconds, at a flow rate of 10 pl/min,
   in a series of concentrations from 4 nM to 8 pM. Dissociation was monitored for
   600 seconds (CTLA4 constructs) or 1200 seconds (GL1 constructs), and the
   surface was regenerated by injecting 10 mM glycine, pH 1.7, for 60 seconds.
15 Binding interactions with the surface, and immobilization levels, were stable
   through at least 100 regeneration cycles. Data were analyzed using
   BiaEvaluation for the T1 00 software (version 2.0.1, GE Healthcare). Binding
   kinetics to immobilized murine CD86 could be determined for all constructs, and
   fit with high accuracy to a bivalent analyte model (Table 7). Equilibrium
20 dissociation constants (Ko) could also be calculated with high accuracy for each
   construct by fitting the observed response at saturation to a steady-state
   equilibrium model. For the CTLA4 variants (SEQ ID NOS:171, 173, 217, 219,
   and 404), simultaneous equilibrium fits across all three flow cells at three
   different immobilization densities gave more accurate results than fitting any
25 one flow cell (a so-called 'multiple Rmax' fit), and so those affinities are listed.
   The results are shown in Table 7, below.

                  Xceptors containing human CTLA4 and human IL10 domains
   (SEQ ID NOS:1 71 and 173) had slightly higher affinities to murine CD86 (1.54,
   1.81 pM) than the reported affinity for human CTLA4-Fc for human CD86
   (2.2 pM; Greene et al. 1996). Human CTLA4 variants containing the L104E
 5 A29Y mutation (SEQ ID NOS:217 and 219) had only a two fold higher affinity
   for murine CD86 (870 - 920 nM); this seems to arise from a combination of a
   beneficial higher initial on-rate for murine CD86 and a detrimental higher initial
   off-rate. Murine CTLA4 seems to have an analogous, or slightly lower overall
   affinity for murine CD86 than human CTLA4. For the GL1 antibody, the parent
10 rat monoclonal antibody was examined along with a SMIP containing a single
   chain GL1 antibody fragment (GL1 SMIP, SEQ ID NO:239); both showed
   similar binding kinetics and overall affinity to murine CD86 (37.7, 26.2 nM,
   respectively), which, was significantly higher (-50 fold) than that of human or
   murine CTLA4-containing constructs. Xceptors containing IL-10 and the GL1
15 antibody fragment (SEQ ID NOS:252 and 256) showed a 3-fold lower affinity to
   murine CD86 compared to the parent antibody or SMIP, although this appeared
   to arise from either a reduced initial on-rate or off-rate in each case.

                          XCEPTOR BINDING TO PD1 BY BIACORETM
20                PD1 binding activity was examined for PDL1-Fc (SEQ ID NO:268)
   and PDL2-Fc (SEQ ID NO:270), as well as xceptors containing a CTLA4
   ectodomain and either PDL1 (SEQ ID NO:13) or PDL2 (SEQ ID NO:336)
   domains, substantially as follows. Binding of PD1 by PDL2 has been generally
    reported to be higher affinity than the binding of PD1 by PDL1; a prior kinetic
25 analysis (Youngnak et al, (2003) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 307, 672)
    suggested moderate affinities (112 nM for PDL1, 37 nM for PDL2), whereas a
   equilibrium analysis done in an alternate format (Butte et al, (2007) Immunity
   27, 111) suggested weaker affinities (770 nM for PDL1, 590 nM for PDL2).
                  SPR measurements were performed on a BlAcoreTM T100 SPR
30  (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala) using HBS-P+ (GE Healthcare) as a running
    buffer. A construct with the PD1 ectodomain fused to a C-terminal AviTag TM
    (SEQ ID NO:406) was initially biotinylated using the BirA enzyme (Avidity, Inc.,
   Aurora, CO) in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and buffer exchanged into PBS. Neutravidin
    (100 [tg/mL in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL)
35 was directly immobilized onto a CM5 chip using standard amine coupling
                                              83

   chemistry (Biacore Amine Coupling Kit, GE Healthcare), with final
   immobilization levels of 191, 771, and 1522 Ru, and used to capture
   biotinylated PD1 at levels of 171, 597, and 1244 Ru, respectively. PDL1/2
   containing constructs were injected for 120 seconds, at a flow rate of 30 pl/min,
 5 in a series of concentrations from 6 nM to 2 pM. Dissociation was monitored for
   1200 seconds, and the surface was regenerated by injecting 50 mM NaOH, 1 M
   NaCl for 30 seconds. Binding interactions with the surface, and immobilization
   levels, were stable through at least 50 regeneration cycles.
                  Data were analyzed using BiaEvaluation for the T1 00 software
10 (version 2.0.1, GE Healthcare). Binding kinetics to immobilized PD1 could be
   determined for all constructs, and fit either with high accuracy to a bivalent
   analyte model (SEQ ID NOS:268 and 270) or a 1:1 binding model (SEQ ID
   NOS:13 and 336) (Table 8). Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) could also
   be calculated with high accuracy for each construct by fitting the observed
15 response at saturation to a steady-state equilibrium model. The results are
   shown in Table 8, below.

 5 affinities to PD1 (2.36, 0.34 pM) than the amino-terminal PDL1/PDL2 fusions

   rate (0.165, 0.0395 vs 0.0544, 0.00724), indicating the PDL1/2:PD1 complex
   may be destabilized when the binding domain is at the BD2 (carboxy-terminal)

               XCEPTOR FUSION PROTEINS BLOCK HUMAN T CELL RESPONSES
                   This example demonstrates that xceptor fusion proteins of this
   disclosure can block a human T cell response. A mixed lymphocyte reaction
   (MLR) was used to test blocking by xceptor fusion proteins. In brief, human
15 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from two donors were isolated
   using standard methods and kept separate. Based on previous studies, PBMC
   from one donor were designated as the "Responder" population and PBMC
   from the second donor were designated as the "Stimulator" population. Both
   donor PBMC were labeled with CFSE using standard methods. To prevent cell
20 division, Stimulator PBMC were treated with mitomycin-C (MMC). MMC (Sigma
   #M4287-2mg) was reconstituted in sterile distilled water (Gibco #15230) at a
   concentration of 0.5mg/ml. Stimulator PBMC were suspended at a
   concentration of 1x10 6/ml in complete culture media (CM), (RPMI-1640
   containing 10% human B serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100ug/ml streptomycin,
25 2mM L-glutamine, NEAA, Na-pyruvate, CM 0.2um filtered) and MMC was
   added to a final concentration of 25 pg/ml. The Stimulator PBMC/MMC mixture
   was then incubated at 370C, 5% C02, for 30 minutes after which cells were
   washed thrice with CM. Responder and Stimulator cells were suspended at a
   concentration of 4x1 06/ml in CM and 0.05ml of each cell population was added
30  per well of a 96 well-flat bottom tissue culture plate for a final 2x1 05
    cells/well/donor. All treatments at the designated concentrations shown in
   figures were added to the plate at the same time as the cells (note
    concentrations shown for antibodies and fusion proteins are at molar
    equivalents). MLR conditions (96 well plate PBMC treatment set-up) were then
35  incubated at 37'c, 5% C02, for the duration of the experiment. MLR
                                             86

   experiments were harvested 7-8 days at which cells were stained with
   fluorescently tagged antibodies against CD5 (e-Bioscience) and CD25 (BD
   Biosciences) and run on a flow cytometer (LSR 11,Becton Dickenson). Data
   was analyzed using FlowJo flow cytometry software (TreeStar). The gating
 5 strategy was as follows: cells that fell within a FSC:SSC lymphocyte gate were
   analyzed for CD5 expression, cells that then subsequently fell within the CD5+
   gate were analyzed for CFSE dilution and CD25 up-regulation. Cells that were
   CD5+, CFSE'" and CD25high were considered activated T cells.
                   Figures 16, 17, 21, and 22 show that many different kinds of
10 xceptor fusion proteins containing a CD86 antagonist in combination with a
   heterologous binding domain are capable of blocking a T cell response to
   Responder/Stimulator MLR conditions.

   bottom plate at 1 x 10' cells/well, 100 pl/well). Various concentrations of IL10
   protein and xceptor fusion proteins were incubated for 24 hours and
25 proliferation was assessed by [3H] thymidine incorporation after 6 hours.
                   The 187 variant of IL10 is known to be less immuno-stimulatory
   compared to wild-type IL1 0 (Ding et al., J. Exp. Med. 191:213, 2000). IL1 0
    normally forms a homodimer with the amino terminal domain of each monomer
    molecule binding to the carboxy terminal domain of the other monomer). The
30  IL10 187 variant (187A and 187S), along with an IL10 molecule having a short
    linker (gggsgg; SEQ ID NO:379) that further separates the two subdomains of
    IL1 0 allowing these subdomains to form an intramolecular dimer, were
   examined in the xceptor format for immunostimulatory activity.
                   Figure 23 shows that mouse IL1 0 is capable of enhancing MC/9
35 cell proliferation to greater extent than CTLA4::IL10-187A (SEQ ID NO:191)

   xceptor, which contains a single mutation in amino acid 87 of IL10. Figure 24
   shows that both human IL10 and (CTLA4::IL10)-75 (SEQ ID NO:173) are
   capable of enhancing MC/9 cell proliferation more than either CTLA4::IL10-187A
   (SEQ ID NO:191) or CTLA4::monolL-10 (SEQ ID NO:181).

           ENGINEERING XCEPTOR MOLECULES TO TARGET SPECIFIC CELL TYPES
                  This Example describes the engineering of Xceptor fusion
   proteins to target specific cell types. This is achieved by engineering BD1 and
   BD2 affinities. Four Xceptor molecules were engineered with different affinity
10 for CD86 and hulL1 OR1. Table 9 shows the different affinity ratios for these
   four molecules. By improving affinity for CD86 through the use of, for example,
   a CD86 binding domain (e.g., 3D1 or humanized FUN1) and an engineered
   IL1 0 molecule (187A) with lower affinity for hulL1 0R1, then such an
   arrangement can be used to favor targeting to a specific cell type of interest,
15 such as APC.

           XCEPTOR ACTIVITY IN IN    Vivo RHEUMATOID    ARTHRITIS ANIMAL MODELS
25  Rheumatoid Arthritis
                  The therapeutic efficacy of any of the xceptor molecules disclosed
    herein is examined in at least one of two murine models of rheumatoid arthritis
                                             89

   (RA), namely the collagen induced arthritis (CIA) and glucose-6-phosphate
   isomerase (G6PI) models. Each of these models has been shown to be useful
   for predicting efficacy of certain classes of therapeutic drugs in RA (see

   2:85; Kamradt and Schubert (2005) Arthritis Res. Ther. 7:20).
             (a) CIA Model
                    The CIA model is the best characterized mouse model of arthritis
   in terms of its pathogenesis and immunological basis. In addition, it is the most
10 widely used model of RA and, although not perfect for predicting the ability of
   drugs to inhibit disease in patients, is considered by many to be the model of
   choice when investigating potential new therapeutics for RA (Jirholt et al. (2001)
   Arthritis Res. 3:87; Van den Berg, W.B. (2002) Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 4:232;
    Rosloniec (2003) Collagen-Induced Arthritis. In Current Protocols in
15  Immunology, eds. Coligan et al., John Wiley & Sons, Inc, Hoboken, NJ).
                    In the CIA model, arthritis is induced by immunization of male
    DBA/1 mice with collagen II (CII) in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA).
    Specifically, mice are injected intradermally/ subcutaneously with CII in CFA on
    Day -21 and boosted with CII in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) on Day 0.
20  Mice develop clinical signs of arthritis within days of the boost with CII/IFA. A
    subset of mice (0% to 10%) immunized with CIlI/CFA develop signs of arthritis
    on or around Day 0 without a boost and are excluded from the experiments. In
    some CIA experiments, the boost is omitted and mice are instead treated with
    Xceptor or control starting 21 days after immunization with CII/CFA (i.e. the day
25  of first treatment is Day 0).
                    Mice are treated with Xceptor, vehicle (PBS), or negative or
    positive control in a preventative and/or therapeutic regimen. Preventative
    treatment starts on Day 0 and continues through the peak of disease in control
    (untreated) mice. Therapeutic treatment starts when the majority of mice show
30  mild signs of arthritis. Enbrel*, which has been shown to have good efficacy in
    both the CIA and G6PI-induced models of arthritis, is used as a positive control.
    Data collected in every experiment includes clinical scores and cumulative
    incidence of arthritis. Clinical signs of arthritis in the CIA model are scored
    using a scale from 0 to 4 as shown in Table 10 below.

           (b) G6PI Model
                   In the G6PI model, arthritis is induced by immunization of DBA/1
 5 mice with G6PI in adjuvant (Kamradt and Schubert (2005) Arthritis Res. Ther.
   7:20; Schubert et al., (2004) J. Immunol. 172:4503; Bockermann, R. et al.

   58:754; Matsumoto et al., (2008) Arthritis Res. Ther. 10:R66). G6PI is an
   enzyme present in virtually all cells in the body and it is not known why
10 immunization induces a joint specific disease. A number of agents, such as
   CTLA4-lg, TNF antagonists (e.g. Enbrel*) and anti-1L6 receptor monoclonal
   antibody, have been shown to inhibit development of arthritis in the G6PI
   model.
                   Male DBA/1 mice are immunized with G6PI in Complete Freund's
15 Adjuvant (CFA) in order to induce arthritis. Specifically, mice are injected
   intradermally/ subcutaneously with G6PI in CFA on Day 0 and develop clinical
   signs of arthritis within days of the immunization. As with the CIA model
   discussed above, mice are treated with xceptor, vehicle (PBS), or negative or
   positive control in a preventative and/or therapeutic regimen. Preventative
20 treatment starts on Day 0 and continues through the peak of disease in control
   mice. Therapeutic treatment starts when the majority of mice show mild signs
   of arthritis. Enbrel*, which has been shown to have good efficacy in both the
   CIA and G6PI-induced models of arthritis, is used as a positive control. Data
   collected in every experiment includes clinical scores and cumulative incidence
25 of arthritis. Clinical signs of arthritis in the G6PI model are scored using a scale
   similar to that employed for the CIA model.
