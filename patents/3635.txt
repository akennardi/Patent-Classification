FIELD OF THE INVENTION
        Described herein are methods for the preparation of Tecovirimat for the
treatment or prophylaxis of viral infections and diseases associated therewith,
particularly those viral infections and associated diseases caused by the orthopoxvirus.
Tecovirimat, with a proprietary name of ST-246*, has a chemical name of N
[(3aR,4R,4aR,5aS,6S,6aS)-3,3a,4,4a,5,5a,6,6a-octahydro-1,3-dioxo-4,6
ethenocycloprop[f]isoindol-2(1 H)-ylb-4-(trifluoromethyl)-benzamide.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
        The Orthopox genus (Orthopoxviridae) is a member of the Poxviridae family and
the Choropoxivirinae subfamily. The genus consists of numerous viruses that cause
significant disease in human and animal populations. Viruses in the orthopox genus
include cowpox, monkeypox, vaccinia, and variola (smallpox), all of which can infect
humans.
        The smallpox (variola) virus is of particular importance. Recent concerns over the
use of smallpox virus as a biological weapon have underscored the necessity of
developing small molecule therapeutics that target orthopoxviruses. Variola virus is
highly transmissible and causes severe disease in humans resulting in high mortality
rates (Henderson et al. (1999) JAMA. 281:2127-2137). Moreover, there is precedent for
use of variola virus as a biological weapon. During the French and Indian wars (1754
1765), British soldiers distributed blankets used by smallpox patients to American
Indians in order to establish epidemics (Stern, E. W. and Stern, A. E. 1945. The effect of
smallpox on the destiny of the Amerindian. Boston). The resulting outbreaks caused
50% mortality in some Indian tribes (Stern, E. W. and Stern, A. E.). More recently, the
                                               1

Soviet government launched a program to produce highly virulent weaponized forms of
variola in aerosolized suspensions (Henderson, supra). Of more concern is the
observation that recombinant forms of poxvirus have been developed that have the
potential of causing disease in vaccinated animals (Jackson et at. (2001) J. Virol.,
75:1205-1210).
        The smallpox vaccine program was terminated in 1972; thus, many individuals
are no longer immune to smallpox infection. Even vaccinated individuals may no longer
be fully protected, especially against highly virulent or recombinant strains of virus
(Downie and McCarthy. (1958) J Hyg. 56:479-487; Jackson, supra). Therefore, mortality
rates would be high if variola virus were reintroduced into the human population either
deliberately or accidentally.
        Variola virus is naturally transmitted via aerosolized droplets to the respiratory
mucosa where replication in lymph tissue produces asymptomatic infection that lasts 1
3 days. Virus is disseminated through the lymph to the skin where replication in the
small dermal blood vessels and subsequent infection and lysis of adjacent epidermal
cells produces skin lesions (Moss, B. (1990) Poxviridae and Their Replication, 2079
2111. In B. N. Fields and D. M. Knipe (eds.), Fields Virology. Raven Press, Ltd., New
York). Two forms of disease are associated with variola virus infection; variola major,
the most common form of disease, which produces a 30% mortality rate and variola
minor, which is less prevalent and rarely leads to death (<1%). Mortality is the result of
disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, that
can be exacerbated by clotting defects in the rare hemorrhagic type of smallpox (Moss,
supra).
        A recent outbreak of monkeypox virus underscores the need for developing small
molecule therapeutics that target viruses in the orthopox genus. Appearance of
monkeypox in the US represents an emerging infection. Monkeypox and smallpox
cause similar diseases in humans, however mortality for monkeypox is lower (1%).
        Vaccination is the current means for preventing orthopox virus disease,
particularly smallpox disease. The smallpox vaccine was developed using attenuated
                                                2

strains of vaccinia virus that replicate locally and provide protective immunity against
variola virus in greater than 95% of vaccinated individuals (Modlin (2001) MMWR (Morb
Mort Wkly Rep) 50:1-25). Adverse advents associated with vaccination occur frequently
(1:5000) and include generalized vaccinia and inadvertent transfer of vaccinia from the
vaccination site. More serious complications such as encephalitis occur at a rate of
 1:300,000, which are often fatal (Modlin, supra). The risk of adverse events is even
more pronounced in immunocompromised individuals (Engler et al. (2002) J Allergy Clin
Immunol. 110:357-365). Thus, vaccination is contraindicated for people with AIDS or
allergic skin diseases (Engler et al.). While protective immunity lasts for many years, the
antibody response to smallpox vaccination is significantly reduced 10 to 15 years post
inoculation (Downie, supra). In addition, vaccination may not be protective against
recombinant forms of orthopoxvirus. A recent study showed that recombinant forms of
mousepox virus that express IL-4 cause death in vaccinated mice (Jackson, supra).
Given the side effects associated with vaccination, contraindication of
immunocompromised individuals, and inability to protect against recombinant strains of
virus, better preventatives and/or new therapeutics for treatment of smallpox virus
infection are needed.
        Vaccinia virus immunoglobulin (VIG) has been used for the treatment of post
vaccination complications. VIG is an isotonic sterile solution of immunoglobulin fraction
of plasma derived from individuals who received the vaccinia virus vaccine. It is used to
treat eczema vaccinatum and some forms of progressive vaccinia. Since this product is
available in limited quantities and difficult to obtain, it has not been indicated for use in
the event of a generalized smallpox outbreak (Modlin, supra).
        Cidofovir ([(S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine] [HBMPC]) is a
nucleoside analog approved for treatment of CMV retinitis in AIDS patients. Cidofovir
has been shown to have activity in vitro against a number of DNA containing viruses
including adenovirus, herpesviruses, hepadnaviruses, polyomaviruses,
papillomaviruses, and orthopoxviruses (Bronson et al. (1990) Adv. Exp. Med. Biol.
278:277-83; De Clercq et al. (1987) Antiviral Res. 8:261 -272; de Oliveira et al. (1996)
Antiviral Res. 31:165-172; Snoeck et al. (2001) Clin Infect. Dis. 33:597-602). Cidofovir
                                                3

has also been found to inhibit authentic variola virus replication (Smee et al. (2002)
Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 46:1329-1335).
        However, cidofovir administration is associated with a number of issues.
Cidofovir is poorly bioavailable and must be administered intravenously (Laezari et al.
(1997) Ann. Intern. Med. 126:257-263). Moreover, cidofovir produces dose-limiting
nephrotoxicity upon intravenous administration (Lalezari et al.). In addition, cidofovir
resistance has been noted for multiple viruses. Cidofovir-resistant cowpox, monkeypox,
vaccinia, and camelpox virus variants have been isolated in the laboratory by repeated
passage in the presence of drug (Smee, supra). Cidofovir-resistance represents a
significant limitation for use of this compound to treat orthopoxvirus replication. Thus,
the poor bioavailability, need for intravenous administration, and prevalence of resistant
virus underscores the need for development of additional and alternative therapies to
treat orthopoxvirus infection.
         In addition to viral polymerase inhibitors such as cidofovir, a number of other
compounds have been reported to inhibit orthopoxvirus replication (De Clercq. (2001)
Clin Microbiol. Rev. 14:382-397). Historically, methisazone, the prototypical
thiosemicarbazone, has been used in the prophylactic treatment of smallpox infections
(Bauer et al. (1969) Am. J Epidemiol. 90:130-145). However, this compound class has
not garnered much attention since the eradication of smallpox due to generally
unacceptable side effects such as severe nausea and vomiting. Mechanism of action
studies suggest that methisazone interferes with translation of L genes (De Clercq
(2001), supra). Like cidofovir, methisazone is a relatively non-specific antiviral
compound and can inhibit a number of other viruses including adenoviruses,
picornaviruses, reoviruses, arboviruses, and myxoviruses (Id.).
         Another class of compounds potentially useful for the treatment of poxviruses is
represented by inhibitors of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAH). This enzyme is
 responsible for the conversion of S-adenosylhomocysteine to adenosine and
 homocysteine, a necessary step in the methylation and maturation of viral mRNA.
 Inhibitors of this enzyme have shown efficacy at inhibiting vaccinia virus in vitro and in
                                                4

vivo (De Clercq et al. (1998) Nucleosides Nucleotides. 17:625-634.). Structurally, all
active inhibitors reported to date are analogues of the nucleoside adenosine. Many are
carbocyclic derivatives, exemplified by Neplanacin A and 3-Deazaneplanacin A. While
these compounds have shown some efficacy in animal models, like many nucleoside
analogues, they suffer from general toxicity and/or poor pharmacokinetic properties
(Coulombe et al. (1995) Eur. J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet. 20:197-202; Obara et al.
(1996) J Med. Chem. 39:3847-3852). It is unlikely that these compounds can be
administered orally, and it is currently unclear whether they can act prophylactically
against smallpox infections. Identification of non-nucleoside inhibitors of SAH hydrolase,
and other chemically tractable variola virus genome targets that are orally bioavailable
and possess desirable pharmacokinetic (PK) and absorption, distribution, metabolism,
excretion (ADME) properties would be a significant improvement over the reported
nucleoside analogues. In summary, currently available compounds that inhibit smallpox
virus replication are generally non-specific and suffer from use limiting toxicities and/or
questionable efficacies.
         In U.S. Pat. No. 6,433,016 (Aug. 13, 2002) and U.S. Application Publication
2002/0193443 Al (published Dec. 19, 2002) a series of imidodisulfamide derivatives
are described as being useful for orthopoxvirus infections.
         New therapies and preventatives are clearly needed for infections and diseases
caused by orthopoxvirus infection.
        The co-owned PCT application WO 2004/112718 (published Dec. 29, 2004)
discloses the use of di, tri, and tetracyclic acylhydrazide derivatives and analogs, as well
as pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, for the treatment or prophylaxis of
viral infections and diseases associated therewith, particularly those viral infections and
associated diseases caused by the orthopoxvirus. The co-owned U.S. Patent
application 2008/0004452 (published Jan. 3, 2008) further discloses a process for
producing ST-246. However, the current process encounters diastereoselectivity (endo
vs. exo), low yields for some steps, use of a genotoxic compound and a very
                                                5

hydroscopic anhydride, and difficulties in securing some raw materials. Thus, there
remains an urgent need to develop more effective processes for producing ST-246

       To a mixture of compound 3 (5.0 g, 26.3 mmol, synthesized according to
W004112718) in EtOH (80 mL, EMD, AX0441-3) was added tert-butyl carbazate 5
(3.65 g, 27.6 mmol, Aldrich, 98%). The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 4 h
under nitrogen atmosphere. LC-MS analysis of the reaction mixture showed less than
5% of compound 3 remained. The reaction mixture was evaporated under reduced
pressure. The residue was recrystallized from EtOAc - hexanes, the solid was filtered,
washed with hexanes (50 mL) and dried under vacuum to afford compound 6 (3.1 g,
39% yield) as a white solid. The filtrate was concentrated and purified by column
chromatography eluting with 25% EtOAc in hexanes to give an additional 3.64 g (46%
yield) of compound 6 as a white solid. Total yield: 6.74 g (84% yield). 1H NMR in CDCI 3:

        Compound 6 (3.6 g, 11 .83 mmol) was dissolved in i-PrOAc (65 mL, Aldrich,
99.6%). 4M HCl in dioxane (10.4 mL, 41.4 mmol, Aldrich) was added drop-wise to the
above solution keeping the temperature below 20 'C. The reaction mixture was stirred
at room temperature overnight (18 h) under nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting solid
was filtered, washed with i-PrOAc (15 mL) and dried under vacuum to yield HCI salt of
compound 7 (1.9 g, 67% yield) as a white solid. The filtrate was concentrated to 1/3 its
volume and stirred at 10 - 15 C for 30 min. The solid was filtered, washed with minimal
volume of i-PrOAc and dried to afford additional 0.6 g (21% yield) of compound 7. Total
yield: 2.5 g (88% yield). 1H NMR in DMSO-d6: 6 6.72 (br s, 3H), 5.68 (m, 2H), 3.20 (s,

Step C. Synthesis of ST-246
        To a mixture of compound 7 (0.96 g, 4 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (19 mL)
was added triethylamine (1.17 mL, 8.4 mmol, Aldrich) keeping the temperature below
20 OC. The resulting solution was stirred for 5 minutes at 15 - 20 "C, to it was added
drop-wise 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl chloride 8 (0.63 mL, 4.2 mmol, Aldrich, 97%) and
the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight (18 h). LC-MS and TLC
analysis showed the correct molecular weight and Rf value of ST-246 but the reaction
was not complete. Additional 0.3 mL (2 mmol, 0.5 eq) of 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl
chloride 8 was added to the reaction mixture at 15 - 20 OC. The reaction was then
stirred at room temperature overnight (19 h). LC-MS analysis indicated ca. 5% of
 starting material 7 still remained. The reaction was stopped and dichloromethane (30
 mL) was added. The organic phase was washed with water (30 mL), saturated aqueous
 NH4CI (30 mL), water (15 mL) and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (30 mL). The organic
 phase was separated, dried over Na2 SO4, filtered and concentrated to give crude
 product. The crude product was purified by column chromatography eluting with 30
 50% EtOAc in hexanes to afford ST-246 (0.34 g, 23% yield) as an off-white solid.
 Analytical data (1H NMR, LC-MS and HPLC by co-injection) were matched with those of
 ST-246 synthesized according to W004112718 and were consistent.
