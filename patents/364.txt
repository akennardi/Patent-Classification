ABSTRACT
A casing mill for downhole casing milling has multiple elongated cutter bases hingedly
connected to a main body by a plurality of positioning arms. An operating mechanism within
the main body of the casing mill, actuated by fluid flow, moves the cutter bases to an
extended position. Multiple cutters fixed to the cutter bases are then positioned to engage a
casing end surface. Preferably, the cutters are arranged in vertically spaced apart rows, such
that when one row is worn out in the milling process a visual indication is seen at the surface,
as the casing mill drops to the next row of cutters.

CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]     This regular patent application claims priority to United States Provisional Patent
Application serial no. 61/681670, filed August 10, 2012, for all purposes.
BACKGROUND
[0002]     Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.
[0003]     Various tools have been developed for downhole cutting or severing of casing
strings in wellbores, and for cutting or milling window sections in casing strings. Generally,
such tools have comprised a main body with multiple hinged arms or blades, which are
rotated outwardly into contact with the casing (by hydraulic or other means) when the tool is in
position downhole. Usually, fluid is pumped down through the drillstring and through the tool
to actuate the mechanism and rotate the blades outward. Once the blades are rotated
outwardly, rotation of the drillstring (and tool) causes the cutting surfaces on the blades to cut
through the casing string. Fluids are pumped through the system to lift the cuttings to the
surface. Known tools, however, cannot efficiently cut or sever multiple, cemented-together
casing strings, and in particular cannot efficiently cut Awindows@ in such strings; by the term
Awindow@ is meant the cutting or milling of a section (e.g. 20') of the casing string, as
opposed to simply severing same. In addition, known tools tend to form long, connected
metal shavings which must be lifted from the wellbore by the fluid flow, else same become
nested together downhole and potentially cause the drillstring to become stuck.
[0004]     It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the
disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.

[0011]      The well bore casing mill with expandable cutter bases, embodying the principles of
the present invention, comprises a main body having a longitudinal bore therethrough.
Means for connecting the main body to a drill string, typically threaded connections, are
provided on at least the upper end of the main body. A plurality of elongated cutter bases are
hingedly connected to the main body by a plurality of linkage arms, and are movable from a
first position substantially recessed into the main body, to a second position extended
outwardly from the main body. An operating mechanism within the main body, operable by
fluid flow, moves the linkage arms and cutter bases. The linkage arms hold the cutter bases
substantially parallel to the axis of the main body. A plurality of cutters are mounted on the
cutter bases, and engage the casing string when the cutter bases are in an outwardly
extended position.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)
[0022]      While a number of embodiments are possible, within the scope of the invention,
with reference to the drawings some of the presently preferred embodiments can be
described.
[0023]      As shown in Fig. 1, the casing mill 10 comprises a main body 20, typically having a
means for connection to a tubular string, referred to herein as a drillstring, said means for
connection preferably being threaded connections 22 and 24 at either end. As is well known
in the art, casing mill 10 is run downhole into a tubular or casing string on a drillstring. Main
body 20 has a bore 26 which runs through at least a portion of the length of main body 20,
sufficiently far down to route fluid to the positioning arm area, but bore 26 may not run the
entire length of main body 20. By having only a partial length bore, and forcing fluid to exit
the tool in the vicinity of positioning arms 50 and the recesses 28 in main body into which

                                                -7
cutter bases 30 retract, fluid flow tends to keep these surfaces flushed and relatively free of
cuttings and debris.
[0024]      Attached to main body 20 by a plurality of linkage or positioning arms 50 are cutter
bases 30. In the embodiment shown in the drawings, casing mill 10 has two cutter bases 30,
but other numbers are possible within the scope of the invention. Positioning arms 50 are
substantially of equal length, so it is understood that when cutter bases 30 are in an extended
position as in Fig. 2, cutter bases 30 are substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of main
body 20. Positioning arms 50 are hingedly attached to both main body 20 and to cutter base
30. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses different numbers of positioning
arms; generally, a minimum of two are required (one actuated arm and at least one additional
arm), but a greater number may be used depending upon the particular tool dimensions.
[0025]      Casing mill 10 comprises a means for moving cutter bases 30 from a first, retracted
position, generally within main body 20 and not protruding significantly therefrom, as shown in
Fig. 1; to a second, extended position, wherein cutter bases 30 are partially or fully extended
from the body, as seen in Fig. 2. This means for moving cutter bases may comprise an
operating mechanism generally utilizing fluid pumped down the bore of the drillstring and
main body 20 to actuate said operating mechanism. While not confining the current invention
to any particular operating mechanism, one suitable mechanism is that disclosed in USP
7063155, owned by the assignee of this invention. The disclosure of that patent is
incorporated herein to the extent necessary to illustrate an exemplary operating mechanism.
Referring also to Fig. 2A, generally, suitable operating mechanisms employ a piston 21
disposed in the bore of main body 20. The piston itself has a bore of smaller diameter than
the bore in which it is disposed; therefore, fluid pumped down bore 26 of main body 20 forces
the piston downward, pushing on a heel portion of an positioning arm 50 and causing it to
rotate about a pin 52. It is understood that only one of positioning arms 50 per cutter base 30
need be actuated; generally the uppermost of positioning arms 50 on each cutter base 30 is
actuated. Fig. 2A shows further detail of an exemplary operating mechanism. For clarity,
cutter bases 30 and some of the plurality of positioning arms 50 are omitted; the internal
operating piston and a pair of operating arms 50 are shown, with heel portions 54 noted.
[0026]      Referring especially to Figs. 6 and 7, cutter bases 30 comprise a plurality of cutters
40 mounted thereon (for space and clarity, not all of cutters 40 are so annotated). While
various embodiments of cutters may be used, one suitable embodiment uses a metal base or
cutter plate which is attached to cutter base 30 by welding or similar means; on the cutter

                                                 -8
plate is attached a plurality of metal cutting surfaces, such as carbide buttons or inserts, or
hardened buttons of other materials, or other means known in the art; alternatively the cutter
plates may be covered with carbide or other suitable hardened surface, or a combination of
hardened material buttons and carbide or similar materials. A variety of cutting surfaces are
suitable, as long as they present a hardened surface to the upward-facing casing edge to
permit milling of same. Further detail regarding acceptable cutting surfaces is set forth below.
[0027]      As can be seen in Figs. 6 and 7, cutters 40 are preferably arranged in a plurality of
vertically spaced apart rows along the length of cutter base 30. To facilitate milling in a
downward direction, with conventional right-hand rotation of the drillstring, cutters 40 may be
angled or inclined as can be seen in Fig. 6, wherein an upper end of cutters 40 is inclined in a
direction of rotation of casing mill 10. The number, position, and spacing of cutters 40 may
be varied to suit particular applications. With cutters 40 positioned in a plurality of vertically
spaced apart, horizontally aligned rows, as in Fig. 6, it can be appreciated that as milling
progresses, and a row of cutters wears out, the diameter of the cutters decreases such that
the next row of cutters above moves downward into contact with the casing surface. In this
manner, a fresh cutting surface is presented to the casing edge being milled. It can be
appreciated that the multiple rows of cutters permit the tool to remain in the hole for an
extended period, thereby greatly reducing time spent in pulling and re-dressing the casing mill
tool. By way of example, each row of cutters may be approximately 1" apart (vertically) from
the adjacent row.
[0028]      Fig. 4 is a view along the section line shown in Fig. 1. Cutter bases 30 are in an
extended position, namely the position shown in Figs. 3 and 5. Generally, cutter bases 30
are sized so as to fit generally within the radius of main body 30 when retracted. The
dimensions of positioning arms 50 and cutter bases 30 yield sufficient outward radius to
position cutters 40 over the edge of casing 70 in order to mill same, as can be seen in Fig. 5.
 Dimensions of cutter base 30 are therefore dependent upon the size of casing 70 being
milled, and upon the dimensions of main body 20 and positioning arms 50. Likewise, the
dimensions of cutters 40 in a radially outward direction may be adjusted as necessary to suit
particular jobs.
[0029]      Figs. 3 and 5 show casing mill 10 in an operating position. Referring first to Fig. 3,
a section of casing 70 is shown in which a window section 72 has already been milled. Cutter
bases 30 are fully extended on positioning arms 50, so as to bring the outer surface of cutter
bases 30 to or nearly to the inner wall of casing 70, and the lower, cutting surface of cutters

                                                 -9
40 against the edge of casing 70. It is understood that, as well known in the art, Fig. 3 shows
casing mill 10 in a downhole position, run downhole on a drillstring (not shown), and being
rotated in a conventional, right hand direction, as noted in Fig. 6. Fluid is also being pumped
through the drillstring and through casing mill 10, and circulated back uphole.
[0030]     With fluid circulation ongoing, thereby extending cutter bases 30 and cutters 40 to
the position shown in Fig. 3, casing mill 10 is lowered so that cutters 40 engage the upper
surface of casing 70. The drillstring and casing mill 10 are rotated while weight is applied to
casing mill 10, resulting in casing 70 being milled away. Milling continues as cutters 40 are
gradually worn away, since as described above once a given row or set of cutters is
sufficiently worn to move down inside the casing inner diameter, the next set of cutters moves
into cutting position and cutting continues.
[0031]     Yet another attribute of casing mill 10 is the centering and stabilizing aspect of
cutter bases 30 in conjunction with the positioning arms 50. Preferably, a section of cutter
bases 30 has no cutters 40 mounted thereon, as noted in certain of the figures as stabilizing
section 32. As is readily understood with reference to Fig. 3, when cutter bases 30 are in
their extended position, placing them into or nearly into contact with the inner wall of casing
70, then main body 20 is centered within casing 70 and stabilized therein, and cutters 40 are
properly positioned over the edge of casing 70 for optimum cutting. A second stabilizing
section 32 may be provided at the upper end of each of cutter bases 30, in order to stabilize
and centralize the tool while pulling it in an uphole direction.
[0032]     Another preferred attribute of casing mill 10 is that the dimensions of positioning
arms 50 and cutter bases 30 are such as to enable cutter bases 30 to bear against and be
supported by main body 20, when cutter bases 30 are in their second, extended position; this
is shown at the location noted as 31 in Figs. 2 and 3. This attribute provides significant
support to cutter bases 30, and consequently cutters 40, as weight is applied to casing mill 10
during the casing milling process.
            CUTTER DESIGN
[0033]     The cutters of the present invention comprise a number of structural attributes
which increase the cutting efficiency of the tool, and extend the cutting life of the tool, and
enable substantially higher rates of cutting than prior art tools. Said structural attributes
include, but are not limited to, the following:

                                                 -10
            1.    The shape and dimensions of cutters 40 are generally rectangular, with a
longer dimension generally axially aligned with the longitudinal axis of the tool, as seen in the
drawings.
            2.    When viewed in a radial direction, as can be seen in Fig. 6, cutters 40 are
preferably angled (or inclined) with respect to the longitudinal axis of main body 20, and of
cutter base 30, such that the non-cutting end of the cutter leads the cutting end of the cutter,
in the direction of rotation or cutting; said another way, an upper end of said cutters 40 is
inclined in a direction of rotation of casing mill 10. In Fig. 6, the direction of movement of the
cutters is shown by the arrow, with the bottom edge of the cutter being the cutting surface.
While the amount of inclination can be varied, angles of three to ten degrees from vertical are
believed to be suitable.
[0034]     It is understood that should the tool be configured so as to cut in an upward or
uphole direction, then the direction of angle or inclination would be reversed from that shown
in Fig. 6.
[0035]     Another embodiment of the cutters takes the form of a chevron, where the cutters in
an upper portion of cutter base 30 are inclined as for cutting in an upward direction, and the
cutters in a lower portion of cutter base 30 are inclined for cutting in a downward direction, as
seen in Fig. 6.
[0036]     Alternatively, cutters 40 may be mounted substantially aligned with the longitudinal
axis of main body 20 (i.e. Astraight@ or Avertically@ mounted).
            3.    Cutter plate 42 is generally rectangular, formed from a selected grade of steel,
forming the face of cutters 40 onto which shaped Abuttons@ or inserts 44 of hardened cutting
material, for example tungsten carbide, are placed (on the face of the cutter), as described
further below, to form the primary cutting surface. The cutter plate is intended to be worn
away as the cutters rotate on and cut the casing, thereby continually exposing fresh cutting
surfaces. For clarity and due to space limitations, not all of cutter plates 42 and buttons 44
are annotated.
            4.    A number of hardened material cutting buttons 44, for example of tungsten
carbide, are placed onto cutters 40, by means well known in the art. One suitable method,

                                                 - 11
known in the art, comprises fixing a desired number and pattern of buttons 44 onto the face
of cutters 40 by use of tinning rods/silver solder, forming in effect a matrix (noted as 46 in Fig.
8A; omitted from the other figures for clarity) of the silver solder in which the buttons 44 sit.
The geometry of each button, and the positioning of the buttons on the cutters, are important
and will be described, particularly with reference to Figs. 8A - 8F.
              a.  the individual buttons 44, seen in a side view, are preferably tapering toward
the rear of the button; that is, the larger diameter is toward the face of the cutter, in the
direction of movement of the cutter. Figs. 8A, 8C, and 8D show an exemplary tapered profile.
 Figs. 8A and 8C are two views of cutters 40, viewed radially inward. Fig. 8D is a view from
the top of a cutter 40 (down its length).
              b.  Fig. 8B is a view of the face of cutter 40. When buttons 44 are viewed end-on,
as in Fig. 8B, the shape of the buttons 44 can be circular, or preferably comprise a multi
sided shape, such as octagonal shape, as in Fig. 8E. It is also desired that the face of the
buttons comprise a single depression or multiple depressions, rather than a smooth face, as
seen in Fig. 8E, with Fig. 8F being a cross-section of an exemplary button. These button face
attributes (which may take the form of dimples) contribute toward a Achip breaker@ design,
where the metal shavings from the casing string being cut are broken into small, discrete
pieces, which tend to simply fall down into the wellbore. There is no need, nor desire, to
circulate such chips to the surface, hence fluids of low viscosity can be used during the
cutting procedure. This is in contrast to prior art casing cutting tools, which tended to create
very long unbroken metal shavings, which in turn tended to aggregate together downhole in a
mass resembling everyday Asteel wool.@ Such masses of metal cuttings could and did result
in drill strings becoming stuck in the hole. Operators would therefore try to lift these long
metal cuttings out of the wellbore with high viscosity fluids, which in turn created other issues.
              c.  As is shown in Figs. 7 and 8B, the individual buttons are preferably arranged
on cutters 40 in a staggered axial or vertical alignment, so as to minimize any gaps in cutting
coverage.
             METHOD OF USE OF THE CASING MILL
[0037]       An exemplary method of use of casing mill 10 with expandable cutter bases 30 can
now be described. A main body 20, cutter bases 30, and positioning arms 50, with multiple

                                                 -12
cutters attached to each cutter base 30, are selected with dimensions appropriate for the size
casing that is to be cut. A relatively short downhole window is first cut in the tubular in
interest, with a two-arm casing cutter or conventional casing mill. A window 72 of sufficient
length that cutter bases 30 can fit therein is generally desired.
[0038]      The next step is to locate casing mill 10 within window 72. Although various
methods are possible, one preferred method is to lower casing mill 10 to a depth known to be
slightly below window 72. Fluid circulation is then started, which will move cutter bases 30
(and cutters 40) outward, into contact with the casing wall. Casing mill 10 is then pulled
uphole, while cutters 40 are in contact with the casing wall. When casing mill 10 is positioned
within casing window 72 such that the lowermost cutters are above the casing edge, cutter
bases 30 can fully extend and multiple indicators will be noted at the surface, including a
decrease in drag, change in pump pressure, decrease in torque, etc. Now, the stabilizing
section 32 of cutter bases 30 will be positioned against the wall of the casing, and cutters 40
will be positioned over the casing edge; this is the position seen in Figs. 3 and 5. Fluid
circulation continues so as to maintain the proper positioning of the cutter bases and cutters.
Rotation of the casing mill 10 is commenced, and a desired amount of weight is applied to the
casing mill, to force the lowermost cutter edges against the upward-facing casing edge and
consequently commence cutting or milling of the casing. It is to be understood that the
sequence of steps set forth above is only one possible method of use; same may be changed
as required, including but not limited to the sequence or order of the different operations,
additional steps may be added, steps may be omitted, etc.
[0039]      As can be understood from Fig. 3, the multiple cutters cut the casing, thus forming
the window. Field experimental use has showed that the configuration of the tungsten
carbide buttons, particularly the non-smooth Achip breaker@ face, results in relatively small
chips of metal, rather than long, connected shavings. Such chips fall down within the
wellbore and do not have to be lifted to the surface by the fluid stream, thereby permitting use
of lower viscosity fluids. Further, the risk of downhole balling up of long metal shavings, and
in turn sticking the drillstring, is eliminated.
[0040]      Once the desired length of window has been cut, fluid flow is stopped, the cutter
bases retract into the tool body, and the tool can be retrieved from the well.

                                                -13
[0041]     As previously noted, the metal of the cutter plates 42 wears away during cutting,
continuously exposing fresh tungsten carbide (or other suitable hardened material) cutting
surfaces. It is believed that this is a key component in achieving the much long cutter life,
and much higher casing cutting rates, than achieved by previous casing milling tools.
[0042]     Yet another attribute of the cutter configuration yields information regarding how
long of a casing window section has been milled. As noted above, each row of cutters 40 is
spaced apart vertically by some known distance, for instance by 1". As a result, when a given
row of cutters has been worn down and is then positioned within the casing inner diameter,
below the window, an indication of the tool dropping slightly as the next row of cutters 40
moves into cutting position against the upward-facing casing edge and can be noted at the
surface. The number of such indications, combined with known dimensions of the cutters (in
a vertical direction), enables the operator to derive a close approximation of the casing
footage milled.
           OTHER USES OF THE APPARATUS
[0043]     It is to be understood that the apparatus can be configured in other manners to
address different well servicing needs, by way of example:
           1.     cutter bases 30 may be employed with no attachments on their outer face, to
be used as a centralizer or stabilizer; or alternatively, stabilizer blades with dimensions to
yield a desired outer diameter can be attached to the cutter bases 30
           2.     casing brushes, scrapers, or similar casing wall cleaning devices could be
attached to cutter bases in lieu of cutters 40, for carrying out casing wall cleaning functions
           3.     with appropriate formation-cutting blades, the apparatus could be used for
hole opening and/or underreaming functions.
           4.     the apparatus can be run in combination with other tools placed at different
locations in the drillstring, such as brushes, scrapers, stabilizers, etc.

                                               -14
           ANOTHER EMBODIMENT AND RELATED USE
[0044]     Another embodiment of the casing mill is shown in Figs. 9A and 9B. That
embodiment and a method of its use will now be described, with reference to those two
figures. This embodiment is particularly suitable for both cutting the initial opening or window
in the casing string to be milled, then (without the necessity of removing the tool from the well)
beginning the milling process and milling substantial lengths of casing.
[0045]     Casing mill 10 generally comprises a number of elements in common with the
previously described embodiments. However, as seen in Figs. 9A and 9B, stabilizing section
32 in a lower portion of cutter base 30 is generally extended to encompass a larger fraction of
the overall length of cutter base 30, for example one half or more of said overall length.
Cutters 40 are also generally longer than in the previously described embodiment, and by
way of example may be one quarter or more of the total length of cutter base 30. In addition,
the dimensions of cutters 40 in addition to the length of the cutters - namely the width (in a
radial direction) of the cutters - may be changed to provide longer cutting/milling time, and/or
to provide a more extended Areach@ or extent of milling.
[0046]     In this embodiment, it is envisioned that only a single row of such larger cutters will
be used. A hardened cutting surface, which may comprise hardened cutting buttons, is
preferably applied to each cutter. The cutting buttons or inserts of the present invention are
arranged in rows, as can be seen from the drawings, and yield significant footage of casing
milled per row of buttons or inserts (which are used up in the milling process). By way of
example, each cutter may be 6" long, with sixteen rows of inserts mounted on each cutter. It
is believed that such arrangement could yield on the order of 240 feet of casing milling
footage, with a single row of cutters.
[0047]     If desired, the shape of the outer edge of cutters 40 may be modified to better make
cutters 40 to make the initial cut through the casing wall. For example, the upper outside
corner of cutters 40, noted as corner surface 43, may be rounded or angled, rather than a
squared-off shape, to better enable the initial cut into the casing wall. In other respects, this
embodiment generally shares the structural aspects of the earlier embodiment, as can be
seen in the drawings.

                                                -15
[0048]      An exemplary method of use of this embodiment can now be described. Casing
mill 10 is lowered to a desired downhole position within a casing string. By way of example
only, in Fig. 9A, casing mill 10 is lowered through a section of smaller casing 100 (for
example, 9-5/8"), in which a window has already been milled, and into position within a
section of larger casing 200 (for example, 13-3/8"), in preparation for cutting through and then
milling a section or window in larger casing 200. Once casing mill 10 is in the desired
position, fluid flow is started, which actuates the operating mechanism (previously described),
rotating positioning arms 50 outward and moving cutter bases 30 outwardly until cutters 40
engage the wall of larger casing 200. Rotation of the drillstring and casing mill 10 is then
commenced, and with continued fluid pumping and rotation cutters 40 cut into and eventually
through the wall of larger casing 200. Once the casing is completely cut through, surface
indicators including a decrease in torque, will be noted. Now, while continuing fluid circulation
and rotation, weight can be applied to casing mill 10 by slacking off on the drillstring, and
milling of the larger casing 200 commences. As previously noted, milling of the casing
window continues until the desired window length is achieved.
            CONCLUSION
[0049]      While the preceding description contains many specificities, it is to be understood
that same are presented only to describe some of the presently preferred embodiments of the
invention, and not by way of limitation. Changes can be made to various aspects of the
invention, without departing from the scope thereof. For example, dimensions of the various
components of the tool can be varied to suit particular jobs; the number of cutter bases can
be varied; the number and positioning of cutters per cutter base can be varied; size and
shape of the cutters can vary; the angle of the cutters on the cutter bases (that is, the angle
with respect to the longitudinal axis of the tool) can be adjusted; the number, size, and
placement of the tungsten carbide (or other suitable material) buttons on the cutters can be
varied; the configuration of the face surfaces (both as to their multi-sided shape, and the
depressions in the face) of the tungsten carbide buttons can be varied to provide the most
efficient Achip breaker@ shape for the application; and methods of use can ve varied.
[0050]      Therefore, the scope of the invention is to be determined not by the illustrative
examples set forth above, but by the appended claims and their legal equivalents.
