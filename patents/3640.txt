                      CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]     This application claims priority to U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 13/534,658, filed June 27, 2012,
which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
                                           BACKGROUND
[0002]     Aortic calcification, also called aortic sclerosis, is a buildup of calcium deposits on the
aortic valve in the heart. This often results in a heart murmur, which can easily be heard with a
stethoscope over the heart. However, aortic calcification usually doesn't significantly affect the
function of the aortic valve.
[0003]     In some cases, though, the calcium deposits thicken and cause narrowing at the
opening of the aortic valve. This impairs blood flow through the valve, causing chest pain or a
heart attack. Doctors refer to such narrowing as aortic stenosis.
[0004]     Aortic calcification typically affects older adults. But when it occurs in younger adults,
it's often associated with an aortic valve defect that is present at birth (congenital) or with other
illnesses such as kidney failure. An ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) can determine the
severity of aortic calcification and also check for other possible causes of a heart murmur.
[0005]     At present there is no specific treatment for aortic calcification. General treatment
includes the monitoring for further developments of heart disease. Cholesterol levels are also
checked to determine the need for medications to lower cholesterol in the hope to prevent
progression of aortic calcification. If the valve becomes severely narrowed, aortic valve
replacement surgery may be necessary.
[0006]     The aortic valve area can be opened or enlarged with a balloon catheter (balloon
valvuloplasty) which is introduced in much the same way as in cardiac catheterization. With
balloon valvuloplasty, the aortic valve area typically increases slightly. Patients with critical
aortic stenosis can therefore experience temporary improvement with this procedure.
Unfortunately, most of these valves narrow over a six to 18 month period. Therefore, balloon
valvuloplasty is useful as a short-term measure to temporarily relieve symptoms in patients who
are not candidates for aortic valve replacement.
                                                     1

    WO 2014/004887                                                            PCT/US2013/048277
[0007]     Patients who require urgent noncardiac surgery, such as a hip replacement, may benefit
from aortic valvuloplasty prior to surgery. Valvuloplasty improves heart function and the
chances of surviving non-cardiac surgery. Aortic valvuloplasty can also be useful as a bridge to
aortic valve replacement in the elderly patient with poorly functioning ventricular muscle.
Balloon valvuloplasty may temporarily improve ventricular muscle function, and thus improve
surgical survival. Those who respond to valvuloplasty with improvement in ventricular function
can be expected to benefit even more from aortic valve replacement. Aortic valvuloplasty in
these high risk elderly patients has a similar mortality (5%) and serious complication rate (5%)
as aortic valve replacement in surgical candidates.
[0008]     Transarterial aortic valve replacement is a new procedure where the aortic valve is
replaced with a self-expanding nitinol or balloon-expandable valve structure. Such procedures
benefit from a smooth non-calcified circumference to attach the new valve. Large calcium
deposits may induce leaks around the valve preventing a firm consistent attachment of the valve
to the aorta. Thus there is a need for a calcium free valve bed to attach such self-expanding
valves.
[0009]     An alternative method and system for treating stenotic or calcified aortic valves is
disclosed and claimed in co-pending U.S. Application Serial No. 12/611,997, filed November
11, 2009 for SHOCKWAVE VALVULOPLASTY SYSTEM. As described therein, a balloon is
placed adjacent leaflets of a valve to be treated and is inflatable with a liquid. Within the
balloon is a shock wave generator that produces shock waves that propagate through the liquid
and impinge upon the valve. The impinging shock waves soften, break and/or loosen the
calcified regions for removal or displacement to open the valve or enlarge the valve opening.
[0010]     The approach mentioned above provides a more tolerable treatment for aortic stenosis
and calcified aortic valves than the previously performed aortic valve replacement. It is also a
more effective treatment than current valvuloplasty therapy. For patients undergoing transaortic
or catheter based aortic valve replacement, this new method can soften, smooth, and open the
aortic valve annulus more effectively than current valvuloplasty and prepare the area for a
catheter delivered valve.
[0011]     In the shock wave valvuloplasty described above, the impingement intensity of the
shockwaves diminishes as a function of the distance from the shock wave origination point to
the valve. More specifically, the impingement intensity of the shock waves is inversely
proportional to the square of the distance from the shock wave origination point to the valve.
                                                  2

    WO 2014/004887                                                          PCT/US2013/048277
Hence, when applying the shock waves, it would be desirable to maximize their effectiveness by
being able to minimize the distance between the shock wave source and the valve location being
treated at that moment.
[0012]     Similar issues are present in angioplasty. There, a calcified region of a vein or artery
may extend over some longitudinal distance of the vein or artery. A point shock wave source
within an angioplasty balloon, in such instances, would not be uniformly effective across the
extent of the calcified region because of the varying distance from the shock wave source to the
various portions of the calcified region.
[0013]     The present invention addresses this and other matters of importance in providing the
most efficient and effective valvuloplasty and angioplasty treatment possible.

                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0051]    FIG. 1 shows an angioplasty system 10 embodying the invention including a dilating
angioplasty balloon catheter 20 including a plurality of shock wave sources according to one
                                                   8

    WO 2014/004887                                                          PCT/US2013/048277
embodiment of the invention. The catheter 20 includes an elongated carrier 21, and a dilating
balloon 26 formed about the carrier 21 in sealed relation thereto at a seal 23. The balloon 26
forms an annular channel 27 about the carrier 21 through which fluid, such as saline, may be
admitted into the balloon to inflate the balloon. The carrier 21 includes a guide wire lumen 29.
The guide wire lunen is arranged to receive a guide wire that may be used to direct the catheter
to a desired location to locate the balloon adjacent a region of an artery or vein or to treated.
[0052]    Carried by the carrier 21 is an electrode structure 40. The electrode structure 40
includes an insulated wire 42 wound about the carrier 21. Within the insulation of the insulated
wire 42 are a plurality of openings 44 that expose corresponding discrete portions of the
insulated wire conductor to the saline within the balloon. Each opening 44 forms a
corresponding shock wave source or electrode 46. As may be see in FIG. 1, a plurality of more
than two electrodes are formed in this manner and in non-touching relation to the sidewalls of
the balloon 26.
[0053]    The electrode structure 40 also includes a counter electrode 24. The counter electrode
24 is disposed in non-touching relation to the sidewalls of the balloon 26 and serves as a
common electrode to cause an electrical arc to occur between each of the electrodes 46 and the
common electrode 24 when a suitable high voltage is applied between the electrodes 46 and the
counter electrode 24.
[0054]    To that end, the electrodes 24 and 46 are attached to a source 30 of high voltage pulses
through a connector 32. The electrodes 24 and 46 are formed of metal, such as stainless steel or
tungsten, and are placed a controlled distance apart to allow a reproducible arc for a given
voltage and current. The electrical arcs between electrode 24 and electrodes 46 in the fluid are
used to generate shock waves in the fluid. The variable high voltage pulse generator 30 is used
to deliver a stream of pulses across electrode 24 and electrodes 46 to create a stream of shock
waves within and along the longitudinal length 25 of the balloon 26 and within the artery being
treated (not shown). The magnitude of the shock waves can be controlled by controlling the
magnitude of the pulsed voltage, the current, the duration and repetition rate. The insulating
nature of the balloon 26 protects the patient from electrical shocks.
[0055]    The balloon 26 may be filled with water or saline in order to gently fix the balloon in
the walls of the artery in the direct proximity with the calcified lesion. The fluid may also
contain an x-ray contrast to permit fluoroscopic viewing of the catheter during use. As
previously mentioned, the carrier 21 includes a lumen 29 through which a guidewire (not shown)
                                                  9

    WO 2014/004887                                                          PCT/US2013/048277
may be inserted to guide the catheter into position. Once the catheter is positioned through use
of the guide wire (not shown) and guide wire lumen 29, the physician or operator can start with
low energy shock waves and increase the energy as needed to crack the calcified plaque. Such
shockwaves will be conducted through the fluid, through the balloon, through the blood and
vessel wall to the calcified lesion where the energy will break the hardened plaque without the
application of excessive pressure by the balloon on the walls of the artery.
[0056]    The voltage needed to produce the arcs will depend on the gap between the electrodes
and is generally 100 to 3000 volts. The pulse duration will also depend on the surface area of
the electrodes 24 and 46 and needs to be sufficient to generate a gas bubble at the surface of the
electrodes to cause a plasma arc of electric current to jump each bubble and, upon each
occurrence, create a rapidly expanding and collapsing bubble, which creates the mechanical
shock wave in the balloon. Such shock waves can be as short as a few microseconds. Both the
rapid expansion and the collapse of a bubble create shock waves. The pulse duration can be
adjusted to favor one over the other. A large steam bubble will generate a stronger shockwave
than a small one. However, more power is needed in the system to generate this large steam
bubble. Traditional lithotripters try to generate a large steam bubble to maximize the collapsing
bubble's shockwave. Within a balloon such large steam bubbles are less desirable due to the
risk of balloon rupture. By adjusting the pulse width to a narrow pulse less than two
microseconds or even less than one microsecond, a rapidly expanding steam bubble and
shockwave can be generated while at the same time the final size of the steam bubble can be
minimized. The short pulse width also reduces the amount of heat in the balloon to improve
tissue safety.
[0057]    Fig. 2 shows another electrode structure 140 that may be employed in the catheter 20
of FIG. 1. Like the electrode structure of FIG. 1, the electrode structure 140 of FIG. 2 includes
an insulated wire 142 wound about the carrier 21 to form electrode coil turns 144. Within the
insulation of the insulated wire 142 are a plurality of openings 146 that expose corresponding
discrete portions of the insulated wire conductor to the saline within the balloon. Each opening
146 forms a corresponding shock wave source or electrode 148.
[0058]    The electrode structure 140 further includes a conductor wire wrapped about the carrier
21 within the balloon 26. The conductor wire 150 is wound in between the electrode coil turns
144 to form a counter electrode 152. This provides more uniform spacings between the

electrodes 148 and the counter electrode 152. All of the electrodes 148 and 152 are disposed in
non-touching relation to the sidewalls of the balloon 26.
[0059]     FIG. 3 shows another electrode structure 240 that may be employed in the catheter 20
of FIG. 1. Here, the electrode structure 240 of the catheter 20 includes an elongated cylindrical
conductor 242 formed of metal, such as stainless steel or tungsten, that overlies the carrier 21.
The electrode structure 240 further includes an insulator 244 overlying the elongated cylindrical
conductor 242. The insulator 244 has a plurality of discrete openings 246 that expose
corresponding areas of the elongated cylindrical conductor to the saline within the balloon 26.
Each opening 246 forms a corresponding electrode 248. Another electrode 250 forms a common
electrode. All of the electrodes 248 and 250 are disposed in non-touching relation to the
sidewalls of the balloon 26.
[0060]     FIG. 4 is a partial sectional view illustrating alternative aspects of the electrode
structure 240 of FIG. 3 to provide the plurality of shock wave sources. Here, at least some of the
openings 246 are filled with a conductive material to form the electrodes 249. The conductive
filler forming electrodes 249 may be of the same material forming the conductive cylinder 242
or may be of a different conductive material. It serves to raise the surface of the electrodes to
above the insulator 244 which, in some cases, may result in more reliable arc formation.
[0061]     Referring now to FIG. 5, it is a side view of another dilating angioplasty balloon
catheter 320 including a plurality of shock wave sources according to a further embodiment of
the invention. Again, the catheter 320 includes and elongated carrier 321 and an angioplasty
dilating balloon 326 at the distal end thereof in sealed relation thereto. The balloon 326 and
carrier 321 form a channel 327 through which the balloon may be filled with a liquid, such as
water or saline. The carrier 321 also includes a guide wire lumen 329 that is adapted to receive a
guide wire 330.
[0062]     The catheter 320 further includes an electrode structure 340 including a first plurality
of electrodes 332 and a second plurality of electrodes 342. The electrodes 332 and 342 are
disposed in non-touching relation to the sidewalls of the balloon 326. During angioplasty
treatment, a voltage having a first polarity is applied to the first plurality of electrodes 332 and a
reversed polarity is applied to the second plurality of electrodes 342. If the voltage across
electrodes 332 and 342 is applied as previously described, an arc will form between
corresponding pairs of the electrodes 332 and 342 to produce corresponding shock waves. In
this manner, shock waves are produced along the longitudinal dimension of the balloon 326.
                                                    11

    WO 2014/004887                                                            PCT/US2013/048277
[0063]     It may be seen in FIG. 5 that the electrodes 332 are of larger dimension and have a
greater surface area in contact with the saline in the balloon than the electrodes 342. This
reduces the impedance to arc plasma formation, allowing the arc plasmas to be produced soon
after the voltage is applied to the electrodes. It has also been found that this causes larger arc
plasmas to be formed producing stronger shock waves. It still further assists in controlling the
electrodes across which the electrical arcs will be produced.
[0064]     FIG. 6 is a perspective view illustrating a manner in which an electrode structure of the
catheter of FIG. 5 may be produced to provide the plurality of shock wave sources according to
an embodiment of the invention. In FIG. 6 it may be seen that the electrode structure 340
includes a first conductor 344 and a second conductor 346. The conductors 344 and 346 extend
along and within the carrier 321. The conductors 344 and 346 may be made to extend along and
within the carrier 321 by co-extruding the conductors 344 and 346 with the elongated carrier
during manufacture of the carrier 321. After the extrusion process, openings 348 and 350 may
be formed in the carrier 321 to expose corresponding portions of the conductors 344 and 346.
This results in the formation of electrodes 332 and 342 respectively. FIG. 7 shows that the
openings, such as opening 350 formed in the carrier 321 may be filled with a conductive filler to
form electrode 342.
[0065]     FIG. 8 is a simplified schematic diagram of a shock wave angioplasty system 410
embodying the invention wherein the shock wave source electrodes are arranged in parallel
circuit. For purposes of this description, the catheter 320 of FIG. 5 shall be used for illustration.
The system includes a high voltage generator 430, a connector 432, and a catheter 320. The
catheter 320 includes the first plurality of electrodes 332 and a second plurality of electrodes
342. Each electrode of the first plurality of electrodes 332 finds a corresponding electrode in the
second plurality of electrodes 342. The connector 422 connects each of the electrodes of the
first plurality of electrodes 332 to the plus (+) side of the voltage generator 430 through a
resistance R and each of the electrodes of the second plurality of electrodes 342 to the minus (-)
side of the voltage generator 430. The resistance R may be provided through individual resistive
elements or through resistivity in the conductors that connect the electrodes to the connector and
are provided to equalize the current available to each electrode pair. This assures that no one
electrode pair will sink all of the available current precluding all other electrode pairs from
producing an electrical arc.

    WO 2014/004887                                                            PCT/US2013/048277
[0066]     FIG. 9 is a simplified side view of the left ventricle 500, aorta 502, and aortic valve
504 of a heart with a valvuloplasty treatment catheter 510 embodying the invention within the
aortic valve of the heart. The catheter 510 includes a treatment balloon 526 placed on both sides
of the aortic valve leaflets 506. Valves of the heart, such as the aortic valve 504 can become
stenotic and calcified. More particularly, the opening of the valve defined by the leaflets can
become stenotic and calcified. This can restrict the size of the opening as the valve leaflets 506
are thickened with calcium deposits and fibrotic tissue. The thickened leaflets 506 and smaller
valve opening restrict blood flow from the heart creating excess work for the heart and poor
cardiac output. Current treatment includes replacement of the valve or attempts to stretch the
valve annulus with a balloon.
[0067]     The treatment balloon 526 includes two longitudinally spaced chambers 528 and 530
placed on opposed sides of the aortic valve leaflets 506. The balloon 526 may be formed from a
compliant or a non-compliant material. The balloon is at the distal end of a carrier 521. The
catheter is placed into position by an elongated delivery tube 532.
[0068]     The two longitudinally spaced chambers 530 and 528 share a common inflation lumen
534 of the carrier 521 to permit the balloon 526 to be filled with a liquid, such as saline.
Alternatively the balloon chambers 530 and 528 may not share the same inflation fluid path.
[0069]     The catheter 510 includes a plurality of shock wave sources that produce electrical arcs
within the balloon to produce shock waves within the confined liquid. The shock waves
propagate through the liquid and impinge upon the balloon wall and the valve. The impinging
shock waves cause the calcified material on the valve to break and/or soften. This permits the
valve opening to be widened or the calcified material to be removed.
[0070]     In accordance with the embodiment of FIG. 9, the catheter 510 includes an electrode
structure 540 within balloon chamber 528. The electrode structure 540 may be seen in greater
detail in FIG. 10. The electrode structure generally includes a plurality of electrodes 542
distributed in a path defining a loop and a common or counter electrode 544. The plurality of
electrodes may be formed in a manner as previously described by use of an insulated conductor,
such as an insulated wire with discrete portion of the insulation removed to form the electrodes.
Each of the electrodes 542 forms a shock wave source. As may be seen in FIG. 9, the electrodes
542 are arranged to be in non-touching relation to the sidewalls of the balloon 526.
[0071]     In use, one polarity, as for example the positive polarity, of the arc forming voltage
may be applied to the plurality of electrodes 542. The minus polarity may be applied to the
                                                   13

counter electrode 544. Because the electrodes 542 are distributed along the loop as shown, the
spacing between the electrodes and the valve will remain essentially constant to enable the entire
aortic valve to be treated without diminished shock wave intensities.
[0072]     FIG. 11 is another simplified side view of the left ventricle 500, aorta 502, and aortic
valve 504 of a heart with another valvuloplasty treatment catheter 610 embodying the invention
within the aortic valve of the heart. The catheter 610 includes a treatment balloon 626 placed on
both sides of the aortic valve leaflets 506. The treatment balloon 626 includes two
longitudinally spaced chambers 628 and 630 placed on opposite sides of the aortic valve leaflets
506. The balloon 626 may be formed from a compliant or a non-compliant material. The
balloon is at the distal end of a carrier 621. The catheter is placed into position by an elongated
delivery tube 632.
[0073]     The two longitudinally spaced chambers 630 and 628 share a common inflation lumen
634 of the carrier 621 to permit the balloon 626 to be filled with a liquid, such as saline.
Alternatively the balloon chambers 630 and 628 may not share the same inflation fluid path.
[0074]     Each of the balloon chambers 628 and 630 of the catheter 610 includes a plurality of
shock wave sources that produce electrical arcs within their respective chambers of the balloon
to produce shock waves within the confined liquid. The shock waves propagate through the
liquid and impinge upon the balloon wall and the valve. The impinging shock waves cause the
calcified material on the valve to break and/or soften. This permits the valve opening to be
widened or the calcified material to be removed.
[0075]     In accordance with the embodiment of FIG. 11, the catheter 610 includes an electrode
structure 640A and 640B within balloon chambers 628 and 630, respectively. The electrode
structures may take the form of electrode structure 540 as shown in FIG. 10. Because the
electrodes are distributed in each balloon chamber 628 and 630 along a loop as shown, the
spacing between the electrodes and the valve on each side of the valve will remain essentially
constant to enable both sides of the entire aortic valve to be treated without diminished shock
wave intensities.
[0076]     FIG. 12 is a partial side view, to an enlarged scale, of an angioplasty catheter with an
electrode structure that may be employed in the embodiments herein, wherein the electrodes are
arranged in series circuit. The catheter 710 may be seen to include an angioplasty balloon 726
that is carried at the distal end of an elongated insulated carrier 721 in sealed relation thereto. As
in previous embodiments, the carrier has a guide wire lumen 729.

[0077]     Embedded within the carrier 721 is a conductor 740 that extends to the distal end of the
carrier and then back toward the proximal end as shown. At points along the carrier 721 and the
conductor 740, portions of the carrier 721 are removed. Corresponding portions of the
conductor are also removed. Each removed conductor portion forms a pair of electrodes. For
example, removed portion 742 forms an electrode pair 743. Similarly, removed portions 744
and 746 form electrode pairs 745 and 747 respectively. One side of the openings 742, 744, and
746 are coated with a conductive material to render one electrode 743a, 745a, and 747a of each
electrode pair larger in surface area then the its other corresponding electrode.
[0078]     Each of the electrode pairs 743, 745, and 747 forms a shock wave source. As may be
noted in FIG. 13, the electrode pairs 743, 745, and 747 are arranged in series circuit. They are
connected to a high voltage source 730 through a connector 732. The larger electrode 743a,
745a, and 747a of each electrode pair assures that all of the electrode pairs will reliably arc when
the high voltage is applied across the string of shock wave sources.
[0079]     FIG. 14 is a simplified schematic diagram of a shock wave angioplasty system 800
embodying the invention wherein the shock wave source electrodes are arranged in plural series
circuits with each series circuit being individually activated. To that end, the system 800
includes series circuits 802, 804, and 806 of electrode pairs connected to a multiplexer 734
through a connector 732. The multiplexer is arranged to connect a high voltage source 730
across each series circuit 802, 804, and 806 individually, one at a time, or in any combination.
[0080]     FIG. 15 is a simplified drawing of another angioplasty system 900 embodying the
invention including a side view of a dilating angioplasty balloon catheter 910 including a
plurality of shock wave sources that are selectably coupled to a power source, one at a time,
according to another embodiment, and FIG. 16 is a timing diagram illustrating the manner in
which the electrodes of FIG. 15 may be selectably coupled to a power source. The system 900
includes a catheter 920, and high voltage power source 930, and a connector 934. The catheter
920 includes an angioplasty balloon 926 carried on a carrier 921 in sealed relation thereto and
arranged to be inflated by a liquid, such as saline. The catheter 920 also includes electrodes 940,
942, and 944 carried on the carrier 921 in non-touching relation to the sidewalls of the balloon
926, and a counter electrode 946, also carried on the carrier 921. The electrodes 940, 942, and
944 are each connected to a multiplexer 934 of the high voltage source 930. When an electrode
is activated, a high voltage from source 930 is applied across a selected one of the electrodes and
the counter electrode to create an electrical arc. The electrical arc causes a plasma to be formed.

The creation of the plasma causes a shock wave. Hence, each electrode 940, 942, and 944 forms
a shock wave source. The shock waves are propagated through the liquid to impinge upon the
balloon sidewall and the calcium deposit to break the calcium deposit up.
[0081]     As may be seen in FIG. 16, the multiplexer 934 can activate the shock wave sources,
one at a time. This reserves all of the high voltage for each shock wave source to thus form
shock waves of maximum strength to be applied to the calcium deposits all along the balloon.
The shock waves can be of repeatable strength. Longitudinal movement of the catheter to treat
the calcium deposits is not required.

modifications may be made, and it is therefore intended to cover all such changes and
modifications which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.
