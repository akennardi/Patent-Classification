10 Technical Field
   [0002]          The present disclosure relates to a joint prosthesis with
   removal device.
   Background
15 [0003]          In the state of the art, there are known surgical prostheses
   adapted to be implanted in the body of a patient in order to replace the
   original joint, affected by particular pathologies and/or wear. Due to said
   pathologies or wear affecting the joints, the patient perceives pain during
   movement and the replacement of said joints makes it possible for him/her
20 to return to a normal life, unburdened by pain during movements.
   [0004]          The surgical operation for the replacement of the natural joint
   with a new artificial joint involves specific intervention passages on the
   patient's bones in order to implant artificial bone coating surfaces and
   articulation elements between the two implanted artificial surfaces. Said
25 artificial surfaces comprise essentially two parts: a first part, in contact with
   the patient's bone, and a second part, not in contact with the patient's
   bone but articulating with a joint element. The first part in contact with the
   bone is responsible for correctly securing the artificial surface to the
   patient's body and can present a portion thereof adapted to be inserted in
30 a bone seat formed by the surgeon during implantation. Said artificial

                                            2
   surface can also be fixed to the bone by means of various techniques; for
   example, it may be cemented or, alternatively, non-cemented.
   [0005]          The state of the art has a plurality of joint prostheses of this
   type for the main joints of the human body. For example, document
 5 US8246687 by Biomet Manufacturing Corporation can be mentioned
   about the shoulder joint; document W02013074700 by Maxx Orthopedics
   Inc can be mentioned about knee joint; document US2014135939 by
   Wright Medical Tech Inc can be mentioned about ankle joint; and so on.
   [0006]          After replacing the natural joint as needed with a known
10 prosthetic joint, the patient can resume his/her normal activities. Of course,
   it is possible that the normal activities of the patient can lead to wear of the
   joint prosthesis implanted or that, with time, said joint prosthesis requires
   operation of total or partial replacement. It will therefore be necessary to
   perform another surgery aimed at partial or total replacement of the
15 previously implanted joint prosthesis.
   [0007]          As is clear, in this new surgery it will be necessary to
   disassemble the joint prosthesis from the patient's bone where it is
   implanted and replace it, possibly in part, with a new one. Depending on
   the methodology used for prosthesis implant, the removal operations of
20 the same may be more or less invasive but, in any case, it will be
   necessary to act on the bone by means of appropriate instruments, such
   as, for example, burrs, saws or the like, in order to detach the joint
   replacement by said bone. It is clear to the skilled in the art that said
   replacement surgeries involve remarkable stresses transmitted to the
25 bone, up to the removal of bone material in order to disassemble the
   prosthesis.
   [0008]          This type of procedure may be considered as a drawback to
   what known in the art. In fact, generally, the stresses imposed by the
   surgeon to detach the previously implanted prosthetic joint can damage
30 the bone structure and cause issues to the patient.
   [0009]          Another drawback to what known in the prior art is the

                                           3
   difficulty for the surgeon to uncouple the joint prosthesis from the patient's
   body. In fact, the surgeon has to operate in the presence of body fluids
   such as blood, and in confined spaces, due to the need to minimize the
   invasiveness of the surgery, circumstances that do not allow for optimal
 5 performance of the operations of detachment of the joint prosthesis from
   the bone.
   [00010]         A further drawback to what known in the prior art is the
   possibility that the surgeon exerts an excessive force during the operations
   of detachment of the prosthetic joint, therefore damaging the bone.
10 [00011]         Another drawback to what known in the prior art is the need
   to employ a relatively long time to obtain an optimal detachment of the
   prosthetic joint, using     different sterile  surgical  instruments   with a
   consequent increase in costs for the structure and prolongation of the time
   required to complete the surgery.
15 [00012]         Said drawbacks are common to all main joint prostheses i.e.,
   for example, shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, hip and ankle joint prostheses.
   [00013]         Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices,
   articles or the like which has been included in the present specification is
   not to be taken as an admission that any or all of these matters were
20 common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present disclosure
   as it existed before the priority date of each of the appended claims.
   Summary

   element being configured to be operated in translation with respect to the
30 second portion, and to generate a detachment force such as to uncouple
   the first portion from the second portion of the joint prosthesis, wherein the

                                           4
   removal element is contained, at least partially, inside an axial cavity of the
   second portion, the removal element having a coupling area configured to
   couple with an attachment device, wherein the coupling area is contained
   inside a housing area of the second portion.
 5 [00015]       According to other aspects, there is provided a method of
   removing a joint prosthesis by means of a removal device of a joint
   prosthesis, the method comprising the following steps: opening an access
   to an axial cavity of a second portion of the joint prosthesis; inserting an
   instrument inside the axial cavity to operate a removal element; relative
10 translation of the removal element in relation to the second portion;
   reaching a stop position by the removal element; generating a detachment
   force; and detaching a second portion from a first portion of the joint
   prosthesis.

   Description of Embodiments
   [00025]        In the drawings, reference numeral 100 refers to a joint
   prosthesis with removal device. In the following description, explicit
   reference will be made to a glenoid joint prosthesis, as depicted in the
10 accompanying drawing only by way of example, however not limiting the
   scope of the present disclosure only to this type of prosthesis.
   [00026]        In the present description, the terms "medial" and "side" will
   be also used to denote the parts of the joint prosthesis 100 with removal
   device that are located in medial or side position with respect to the bone
15 structure on which said device is implanted, as shown in Figures 6 to 9.
   The terms "upper" and "lower" will be used with respect to the assembly
   direction of the device 100 as shown in Figure 5.
   [00027]        The joint prosthesis 100 with removal device essentially
   comprises: a first portion, designated in the following as lower portion 10, a
20 second portion, designated in the following as upper portion 50, and a
   removal element 70, made, for example, of a metal material, preferably
   cobalt-chromium alloys, titanium alloys and/or the like.
   [00028]        The upper portion 50 has two parts: a medial stem part 51
   and a side part 52, having a substantially elliptical section. Said two parts
25 are mutually integrally connected. The side part 52 is characterised by two
   faces: a medial face 52.2 and a side face 52.1. Said side face 52.1 in the
   side part 52 has a substantially elliptical shape, with a tapered lip 53
   tapered and a concave, circular-section central area 54. Said central area
   54 substantially has a spherical-cap shape and is adapted to receive a
30 leaning humeral head (not shown). The medial face 52.2 in the side part
   52 of the upper portion 50 has a housing area 52.3 and, outside of it, one

                                          7
   edge 53.1 of lip 53. Said medial face 52.2 is integrally connected, in its
   central area, to the medial stem part 51.
   [00029]        The medial stem part 51 has a cylindrical shape with an axial
   cavity 51.4 and two ends: a lower end 51.6, open to ensure access to said
 5 axial cavity 51.4, and an upper end 51.5, integrally connected to the
   medial face 52.2 of the side part 52. Said axial cavity 51.4 of the medial
   stem part 51 has, therein and for a substantial part of its axial extension, a
   thread 51.1. At the free end 51.6 of the stem medial part 51 there are two
   blunted guides 51.2 and 51.3.
10 [00030]        It should be noted that the stem medial part 51 is positioned
   such that the end 51.5 of the through axial cavity 51.4 is centrally aligned
   with the side part 52, so that the central axis of the axial cavity 51.4 is
   aligned with the centre of the central area 54.
   [00031]       A removal element 70 is received within said through axial
15 cavity 51.4, for instance by helical coupling with thread 51.1. Said removal
   element 70 has a substantially cylindrical shape with two free ends: a first
   free end 70.1, externally projecting through the free end 51.5, and a
   second free end 70.2, received within the through axial cavity 51.4 of the
   medial stem part 51. Both free ends 70.1 and 70.2 respectively have a
20 coupling area 70.6 and 70.5 for coupling to a known fixing device, for
   example a screwdriver or an Allen wrench.
   [00032]        On a substantial part of the outer surface of said removal
   element 70 there are engagement/coupling means, for example a thread
   70.4 adapted for coupling with thread 51.1, provided inside the through
25 axial cavity 51.4. It should be noted that, in a preferred embodiment, said
   thread 70.4 also extends along the outer side surface of the free end 70.2
   and does not extend on the outer side surface of the free end 70.1.
   [00033]        The lower portion 10 of the surgical prosthesis 100 with
   removal device also comprises two parts: a side part 11 and a medial part
30 12. The side part 11 of the lower portion 10 has a shape allowing it to be
   received within the housing area 52.3 while in the configuration of use.

                                          8
   Particularly, said side part 11 has a central area 14. Said central area 14
   has a substantially circular, concave section with a central through hole 15
   and a plurality of radial holes 16.1, 16.2, 16.3 and 16.4, also passing
   through the fitting of said lower portion to the patient's bone by special
 5 fixing instruments like, for instance, screws known in the art and not
   illustrated.
   [00034]        Integrally connected to said distal part 11 of the lower portion
   10 is a medial part 12. The medial part 12 has a cylindrical shape
   projecting medially from side part 11 and has a closed free end 12.1. The
10 outer surface 12.3 of medial part 12 has a configuration allowing optimal
   coupling with a special positioning hole formed into the patient's bone by
   the surgeon during the implant procedure. For example, the outer surface
   of medial part 12 can be split and/or coated with porous material suitable
   for osteointegration such as, for example, a known trabecular metal.
15 [00035]        The inner part of said medial part 12 has an axial cavity 12.2,
   blind and extending throughout the length of said medial part 12 and
   placed in communication with the central through hole15 of the central
   area 14 in the side part 11. Said axial cavity 12.2 is adapted to receive
   therein, in the configuration of use, the medial stem part 51 and the free
20 end 70.1 of the removal element 70 projecting therefrom.
   Implant procedure.
   [00036]        For the implant procedure of the surgical prosthesis 100 with
   removal device, the surgeon provides for an adequate seat into the
   patient's bone. Said adequate seat can include a substantially cylindrical
25 housing intended to receive the medial part 12 of the lower portion 10, in
   addition to a spherical cap-shaped housing at least partially adapted to
   receive the side part 11 of the lower portion 10. In order to secure the
   lower portion 10, the surgeon proceeds with the insertion of coupling
   means, e.g. known surgical screws, inside holes 16.1, 16.2, 16.3 16.4, and
30 secures the lower portion 10 to the patient's bone.
   [00037]        In the configuration of use, the upper portion 50 comes

                                           9
   already coupled, for example by threaded coupling, with the removal
   element 70.
   [00038]        The surgeon then proceeds with the coupling of the upper
   portion 50 with the lower portion 10 by sliding the stem part 51 within the
 5 axial cavity 12.2 until the proximal edge 53.1 of lip 53 comes into contact
   with the edge 14.1 of the central area 14 of the lower portion 10. At this
   point, by an interference fit, for example with a Morse-cone coupling type,
   known in the art and not further described, the upper portion 50 and the
   lower portion 10 are integrally connected to each other.
10 Operation.
   [00039]        In order to decouple the upper portion 50 from the lower
   portion 10, the surgeon uses a special instrument or a instrument known in
   the art such as, for example, a puncher or a drill and/or the like, making a
   hole central to the concave central area 54 of the upper portion 50. In this
15 way, thanks to the advantageous positioning of the axial cavity 51.4 of the
   medial stem part 51, which is aligned axially from said concave central
   area 54, an access pathway to said axial cavity 51.4 and, thus, to the end
   70.2 of the removal element 70 therein contained can be created. Then,
   by a known instrument such as, for example, a screwdriver C (Figure 7) or
20 an Allen wrench, the surgeon accesses, through the hole just made, the
   axial cavity 51.4 until engaging the coupling area 70.6 of the removal
   element 70. At this point, the application of a force to the removal element
   70 puts it in relative translation with respect to the medial stem part 51 of
   the upper portion 50. In this example, the removal element 70 being
25 coupled to the medial stem part 51 by threaded coupling, the surgeon will
   apply a torque to said removal element 70 to set it in rotation. Said rotation
   will bring the removal element 70 to translation in the axial direction with
   respect to the medial stem part 51           in side-medial direction. This
   translation, however, will be prevented when the removal element 70
30 comes into contact with the blind medial end of the axial cavity 12.2. The
   removal element 70 thus comes in abutment against said blind medial end

                                          10
   reaching a position known as stop.
   [00040]       Failure of further translating in medial-side direction of the
   removal element 70 causes transmission of a force, known as release
   force, having a direction parallel to that of translation just described, but in
 5 a medial-side direction, through the threaded coupling between threads
   51.1 and 70.4, respectively of the medial stem part 51 and the removal
   element 70, to the upper portion 50. When this force exceeds the force
   generated by the interference fit by which the upper portion 50 and lower
   portion 10 are coupled, the upper portion 50 uncouples from the lower
10 portion 10, allowing the surgeon to extract it without acting in any manner
   on the patient's bone structure.
   [00041]       As appears clearly from the above description, the present
   disclosure provides a surgical prosthesis 100 with removal device.
   First alternative.
15 [00042]       An alternative embodiment is illustrated in Figure 10. In said
   Figure 10 is an instrument 200 incorporating therein the previously
   described removal element 70. As is readily understandable from
   mentioned Figure 10, it comprises: a handle 210, sized and shaped to be
   comfortably grasped by the surgeon, preferably made of a metal material,
20 having a cylindrical-shaped central portion 220 extending from said handle
   210, made of metallic material and having, at its free, integral end, a
   removal element 700. Said removal element 700 has, for example,
   engagement/coupling means on its outer surface, for example a thread
   704.
25 Operation
   [00043]        In order to decouple the upper portion 50 from the lower
   portion 10, the surgeon uses a special instrument or an instrument known
   in the art such as, for example, a puncher or a drill and/or the like, making
   a hole central to the concave central area 54 of the upper portion 50. In
30 this way, thanks to the advantageous positioning of the axial cavity 51.4 of
   the stem medial part 51, which is aligned axially with respect to said

                                          11
   concave central area 54, an access pathway to said axial cavity 51.4, thus
   reaching thread 51.1 present therein, can be created. After reaching said
   thread 51.1 by acting properly on instrument 200, for example placing it in
   rotation, thread 704 provided on the outer surface of the removal element
 5 700 integral to said instrument 200 engages thread 51.1. Said rotation will
   cause translation of the removal element 700 in the axial direction with
   respect to the medial stem part 51 in side-medial direction. The surgeon
   will maintain the instrument 200 in rotation until the free end of the
   engagement element 704 comes into contact with the blind end of the
10 cavity 12.1, thereby achieving a stop position.
   [00044]        Failure of further translating in medial-side direction of the
   removal element 700 causes transmission of a force, known as release
   force, having a direction parallel to that of translation just described, but in
   a medial-side direction, through the threaded coupling between threads
15 51.1 and 704, respectively of the medial stem part 51 and the removal
   element 700, to the upper portion 50. When this force exceeds the force
   generated by the interference fit by which the upper portion 50 and lower
   portion 10 are coupled, the upper portion 50 uncouples from the lower
   portion 10, allowing the surgeon to extract it without acting in any manner
