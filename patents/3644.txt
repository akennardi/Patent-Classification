                                                 1
A WATER HEATING SYSTEM
[0001] This is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2013230675, the
contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.
Field of the Invention
[0002] The present invention relates to a water heating system. The present invention has been
primarily developed for use with gas instantaneous type water heaters and will be described
hereinafter with reference to that application. However, the invention is not limited to this
particular field of use and can also be used with electrical instantaneous type heaters. In the
United States of America, instantaneous type water heaters are known as tank-less heaters.
Background of the Invention
[0003] The Applicant's international PCT patent application NO. PCT/AU2011/000579 (WO
2011/146962) discloses a water heating system, with reference to Fig. 5, in which heated water
can be supplied to a water storage tank from either a gas instantaneous type water heater or a
solar panel.
[0004] The water heating system shown in Fig. 5 has a single pump which draws water from
the bottom of the water storage tank and pumps it to a first valve. A controller controls the
first valve to direct the pumped water to pass through either the gas instantaneous type water
heater or through the solar panel for heating, before being returned to the top of the water
storage tank. The water heating system also has a second valve which the controller controls
to drain water from the solar panel, when the water in the solar panel is sensed to be reaching a
temperature where it may freeze and damage the solar panel. The controller controls the pump
and the valves in such a way as to always attempt to use solar energy as a preference, in order
to minimise purchased energy (e.g. gas), but to switch to gas in order to satisfy a user's heated
water demands.
[0005] In the disclosed system, water can be heated by only one of the gas instantaneous type
heater or the solar panel at a time. A limitation of the disclosed system is that a user's

                                                  2
demands may necessitate the water being heated by the gas heater during periods where
available solar energy is not being utilized.
Object of the Invention
[0006] It is an object of the present invention to provide a water heating system that
overcomes the above limitation.

[0011] The water heating system preferably includes a valve arrangement in fluid
communication between the second pump outlet and the at least one solar panel inlet, the
valve arrangement controllable between allowing water to be pumped from the second pump

[0012] The valve arrangement preferably includes a ball valve with first and second operating
states, the first operating state allows or prevents water to be pumped from the second pump
outlet to the inlet of the at least one solar panel when open or closed respectively and the

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments
[0028] Fig. 1 shows a first embodiment of a water heating system 10. The system 10 includes
a 315 litre water storage tank 12 that, as will be described in more detail below, operates in a
dual zone manner with an upper (gas) heated zone 12a and a lower (solar) heated zone 12b.
[0029] The tank 12 is generally cylindrical in construction and includes a side wall 12c.
Mains water MW is admitted into the tank 12 via an inlet 14 near the bottom of the tank 12.
The tank 12 also includes an outlet 16, near the top of the tank 12, for heated water HW. The
outlet 16 is connected to a user controlled outlet device, such as a hot water tap (not shown).
[0030] The system 10 also includes a gas instantaneous type water heater 18, preferably of 4,
5 or 6 Star rating. The gas heater 18 includes an inlet 18a and an outlet 18b. The system 10
also includes a first pump 20, with an inlet 20a and an outlet 20b. As shown in Fig. 2, the tank
wall 12c includes an opening 12d through which passes a pipe-in pipe fitting 22. The fitting
22 has an inner piper 22a and an outer pipe 22b. Water flowing through the interior of the
inner pipe 22a is independent of the water flowing between the exterior of the inner pipe 22a
and the interior of the external pipe 22b. The external pipe 22b acts as a tank outlet and
provides water from about the middle of the tank 12 to the inlet 20a of the pump 20. The
outlet 20b of the pump 20 communicates water to the inlet 18a of the heater 18. The outlet
18b of the heater provides heated water to an inlet 24 of the tank 12, which is positioned near

                                                  6
the top of the tank 12. The upper zone 12a of the tank 12, the heater 18, the first pump 20 and
the external pipe 22b together form a gas heating circuit.
[0031] The system 10 also includes a solar panel 30 with a solar air bleed 32. The solar panel
30 has an inlet 30a and an outlet 30b. The system 10 also includes a second pump 32 with an
inlet 32a and an outlet 32b. The inlet 32a of the pump 32 draws water from near the bottom of
the tank 12 via an outlet 34. The outlet 32b of the pump 32 supplies water to a valve
arrangement 36. The valve arrangement 36 includes two solenoid gate type valves 38 and 40.
The first valve 38 is biased to an open position in the absence of electrical power and closes
when energised. The second valve 40 is biased to a closed position in the absence of electrical
power and opens when energised. The first valve 38 has an inlet 38a and an outlet 38b. The
second valve 40 has an inlet 40a and an outlet 40b. The outlet 38b of the first valve 38 is in
fluid communication with the inlet 30a of the solar panel 30. The inlet 30a of the solar panel
30 is also in fluid communication with the inlet 40a of the second valve 40. The system 10
also includes a one-way valve 42 with an inlet 42a and an outlet 42b. The one-way valve 42
only allows water to flow from the outlet 30b of the solar panel 30 and into the tank 12 via the
internal pipe 22a of the pipe-in pipe fitting 22. The lower zone 12b of the tank 12, the solar
panel 30, the second pump 32, the internal pipe 22a and the one-way valve 42 together form a
solar heating circuit.
[0032] The system 10 also includes a controller 44 which receives an indication of the water
temperature in the tank 12 and the solar panel 30 via temperature sensors (not shown). The
controller 44 is also able to issue control signals to the gas instantaneous heater 18, the first
pump 20, the second pump 32, the first valve 38 and the second valve 40.
[0033] The operation of the system 10 shall now be described. In response to user demand,
the controller 44 energises the gas heater 18 and also the first pump 20. This causes relatively
cooler water to be drawn from the middle of the tank 12 through the external pipe 22b of the
pipe-in pipe fitting 22 and pumped through the gas heater 18 for heating. The heated water is
then pumped to the tank 12 and is available for drawing off by a user at outlet 16.
[0034] If sufficient solar energy is available, the controller 44 can also energise the second
pump 32 to withdraw water from the bottom of the tank 12 at the outlet 34 and pump it
through the first valve 38 and into the solar panel 30 for heating. The heated water then is

                                                 7
then pumped from the solar panel 30, through the one-way valve 42, and is returned to the
tank 12 via the internal pipe 22a of the pipe-in pipe fitting 22.
[0035] Importantly, the gas heating circuit and the solar heating circuit can be operated
independently of one another. This advantageously means that available solar energy is still
able to be collected and utilised notwithstanding that the user demands of the system 10
necessitate gas heating. This ensures that available solar energy is not wasted.
[0036] If the controller 44 senses that the water in the solar panel 30 is close to freezing then it
de-energises the second pump 32 and energises the first valve 38 and the second valve 40.
This closes the first valve 38 and opens the second valve 40, and allows the water in the solar
panel 30 to drain to atmosphere through the outlet 40b.
[0037] The system 10 utilizes an additional pump to that described with reference to Fig. 5 of
the Applicant's previously mentioned PCT application. However, the additional cost of this
component is offset due to the fact that the valve arrangement 36 comprises a pair of solenoid
valves 38 and 40, which are more robust and less expensive than the motorized ball valves
required for the earlier system. The valves 38 and 40 are also very energy efficient, as they
are only energized during the draining of the solar panel 30 and therefore do not consume any
energy during their predominant operating state.
[0038] The pipe-in pipe fitting 22 advantageously allows the gas circuit and the solar circuit to
communicate with the water tank 12 via a single opening 12d. This advantageously requires
only one hole to be made in the tank, which minimizes leak risks and stress fracture risks.
[0039] Fig. 3 shows a second embodiment of water heating system 50. The system 50 is
similar to that of the system 10 previously described and like features are indicated with like
reference numerals. The system 50 includes a third pump 52 which has an inlet 52a and an
outlet 52b. The system 50 also includes a first heat exchanger 54 with an inlet 54a and an
outlet 54b. The inlet 52a of the pump 52 is in fluid communication with the heated water
outlet 16 of the water tank 12. The outlet 52b of the pump 52 is in fluid communication with
the inlet 54a of the heat exchanger 54. The outlet 54b of the heat exchanger 54 is in fluid
communication with an inlet 56 of the tank 12.

                                                   8
[0040] In operation, the controller 44 energizes the third pump 52 thereby causing heated
water from the top of the tank 12 to circulate through the first heat exchanger 54. The heat
exchanger 54 can be positioned in a space to be heated, such as a room, and hereby provide a
space heating circuit which utilizes gas and/or solar energy as its heating source.
[0041] In a further variation, the system 50 can include a closed hydronic heating circuit 56
comprising a fourth pump 58, a second heat exchanger 60 and a space heater such as a radiator
62 within a room 64. The second heat exchanger 60 is positioned in a heat exchange
relationship with the first heat exchanger 54. The controller 44 energizes the third pump 52
and the fourth pump 58. The energizing of the third pump 52 causes heated water to be
circulated through the first exchanger 54 as described above. This heat is then transferred to
the second heat exchanger 60 whereafter it is circulated by the fourth pump 58 through the
radiator 62. Again, this provides a space heater that is gas and/or solar powered.
[0042] Fig. 4 shows a third embodiment of water heating system 70. The system 70 is similar
to that of the systems 10 and 50 previously described and like features are indicated with like
reference numerals. However, in the system 50, the controller 44 receives an indication of the
water temperature in the tank 12 via temperature sensors 44a, 44b and 44c and receives an
indication of the water temperature in the solar panels 30 via a temperature sensor 44d. The
controller 44 is able to issue control signals to the first pump 20. The gas heater 18 has an
internal controller which turns it on when the first pump 20 is turned on and turns it off when
the pump 20 is turned off.
[0043] The system 70 also includes a ball valve 72, with an inlet 72a and an outlet 72b, a
tempering valve 74, with an inlet 74a and an outlet 74b, and a room thermostat 75. The outlet
52b of the third pump 52 is in fluid communication with the inlet 72a of the ball valve 72. The
outlet 72b of the ball valve 72 is in fluid communication with the inlet 74a of the tempering
valve 74. The outlet 74b of the tempering valve 74 is in fluid communication with the inlet 14
of the tank 12, via a hydronic heating line 78, in which is provided a pair of one way valves
76. The tempering valve 74 is also in fluid communication with the mains (cold) water supply
MW.
[0044] In operation, the gas heater 18 is turned on and off responsive to the first pump 20
being turned on and off by the controller 44. The first pump 20 is turned on and off,

                                                 9
responsive to the temperature sensors 44a to d, particularly sensors 44b and 44c which indicate
the condition of the water in the upper heated water zone 12a of the tank 12.
[0045] The hydronic circuit is independently controlled by the room thermostat 75. More
particularly, the amount of heated water that is supplied to the hydronic line 78 from the
heated water zone 12a is controlled by throttling the ball valve 72. At maximum water
temperature, the volume flow rate of the heated water supplied to the hydronic line 78 is about
80-85% of the maximum volume flow rate of the first pump 20 associated with the gas heater
18. The 20-15% balance of the maximum output of the first pump 20 and the gas heater 18 is
reserved for maintaining the temperature of the heated water zone 12a.
[0046] Colder mains water MW can also be mixed into the heated water being supplied to the
hydronic line 78, in order to adjust the temperature of same, via the tempering valve 74.
[0047] The system 70 advantageously allows for control of the heater 18 to be simplified to
only heating energisation responsive to water flow therethrough. The system 70 also
advantageously allows the heat supplied to the hydronic circuit to be adjusted, via throttling of
the ball valve 72, so as to not exhaust the energy capacity of the gas heater 18.
[0048] Fig. 5 shows a fourth embodiment of water heating system 90. The system 90 is
similar to system 10 previously described and like features are indicated with like reference
numerals. However, in the system 90, the fitting 22 is not utilised and instead a pair of
openings 12d and 12e are made in the tank wall 12c. The opening 12d is an outlet for the gas
heating circuit and the opening 12e is an inlet for the solar circuit. Further, the (dual solenoid
gate type valves) valve arrangement 36 is replaced by a single ball valve 92. The ball valve 92
has two operating states, one providing fluid communication from the outlet 32b of the pump
32 to the inlet 30a of the solar panel 30 and another providing fluid communication the inlet
30a to atmosphere (for draining).
[0049] Fig. 6 shows a fifth embodiment of water heating system 100. The system 100 is
similar to system 70 previously described and like features are indicated with like reference
numerals. However, in the system 100, the fitting 22 is not again utilised and replaced by the
pair of openings 12d and 12e in the tank wall 12c. The opening 12d is an outlet for the gas
heating circuit and the opening 12e is an inlet for the solar circuit.

                                                10
[0050] Although the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, it
will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that the invention can be embodied in
many other forms.
