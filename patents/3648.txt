                                              Background
[0002]       Approximately 133 million Americans currently suffer from at least one chronic
condition. This number is expected to rise to approximately 165 million by the year 2020. As a
result, the cost of healthcare in the United States is expected to increase dramatically. Attempts
have been made to improve the health of individuals by providing them with tools to monitor
and track their wellness data. Wellness data can generally include any type of data associated
with a person's health, such as their weight, heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose level,
medication compliance, activity level, or the like. Users can monitor their wellness using
devices, such as blood pressure cuffs, blood glucose monitors, electrocardiograms, step counters,
and the like. Software applications (e.g., Apps) associated with each of these devices have also
been developed to allow users to track their wellness data over time. While each application can
be used to view useful information about a user's health, current applications are limited in their
ability to allow users to store, view, and share wellness data collected by different devices.
[0002A]       Reference to any prior art in the specification is not an acknowledgment or
suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any jurisdiction or
that this prior art could reasonably be expected to be understood, regarded as relevant, and/or
combined with other pieces of prior art by a skilled person in the art.

include denying a search query on wellness data from the plurality of users absent authorization
that their wellness data is to be searchable.
[0011]     In some examples, the wellness data is stored in the database of wellness data
anonymously.
[0012]     Another example process may include receiving, from a plurality of user devices,
wellness data authorized for storage to a database of wellness data; storing the wellness data in
the database of wellness data; receiving, by a server, an authorization from a user to provide
access to at least a portion of the user's wellness data in the database of wellness data; and
providing access to the at least a portion of the user's wellness data in the database of wellness
data based on the authorization.
[0013]     In some examples, the authorization authorizes entities to perform search queries on
the at least a portion of the user's wellness data.
[0014]     In some examples, the authorization is received in response to a request made by a
querying entity. In other examples, the request comprises a selectable link transmitted to a user
device of the user, and wherein the authorization is transmitted to the server in response to a

                                        Detailed Description
[0025]    In the following description of the disclosure and examples, reference is made to the
accompanying drawings in which it is shown by way of illustration specific examples that can be
practiced. It is to be understood that other examples can be practiced and structural changes can
be made without departing from the scope of the disclosure.
[0026]    The present disclosure relates to receiving and sharing wellness data. The wellness
data can be received by a user device from any number of sensors external or internal to the user
device, from a user manually entering the wellness data, or from other users or entities. The user
device can securely store the wellness data on the user device and transmit the wellness data to
be stored on a remote registry database. A user of the device can share some or all of the
wellness data stored in the registry database with research entities conducting research studies.
SYSTEM OVERVIEW
[0027]    FIG. 1 illustrates an example system 100A for receiving wellness data. As mentioned
above, wellness data can include, but is not limited to, any type of data associated with a
person's health, such as their weight, heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose level, medication
compliance, activity level, or the like. System 100A can be used to collect wellness data
associated with a user, store the wellness data and present the wellness data to the user in useful
ways. System 100A can further be used to collect non-wellness data along with wellness data,
correlate the non-wellness data with the wellness data, and display the non-wellness data with
the wellness data..
                                                   5

                                                                                             1002085170
[0028]    System 100A can include one or more user devices 110 including any electronic
device, such as a mobile phone, tablet computer, desktop computer, laptop computer, PDA, or
the like. User device 110 can include an operating system and a wellness database 111 for
securely storing wellness or non-wellness data along with associated metadata, such as the time
the data was recorded, type of data, device used to record the data, user associated with the data,
and the like. User device 110 can further include application programming interfaces (APIs)
with access controls for storing data in the wellness database 111 and for accessing data stored
in the wellness database 111.
[0029]    User device 110 can be configured to receive wellness or non-wellness data from
various sources and can store the received data in the wellness database. For example, user
device 110 can be configured to receive wellness or non-wellness data from sensors 102, 104,
106, and 108. These sensors can include any type of sensor capable of obtaining wellness data,
such as a biometric sensor, activity tracker, or the like. For example, sensors 102, 104, 106, and
108 can include, but are not limited to, a scale, blood pressure cuff, blood glucose monitor,
electrocardiogram, step counter, gyroscope, accelerometer, SpO2 sensor, respiration sensor,
posture sensor, stress sensor, photoplethysmogram, galvanic skin response sensor, temperature
sensor, asthma inhaler, or the like. Sensors 102, 104, 106, and 108 can also include other types
of sensors, such as audio sensors, ambient light sensors, electromagnetic sensors, touch sensors,
capacitive sensors, and the like, for obtaining non-wellness data, such as situational data,
temporal data, personal data, contact data, and the like data. In some examples, each sensor can
be a separate device, while, in other examples, any combination of two or more of the sensors
can be included within a single device. For example, the gyroscope, accelerometer,
photoplethysmogram, galvanic skin response sensor, and temperature sensor can be included
within a wearable electronic device, such as a smart watch, while the scale, blood pressure cuff,
blood glucose monitor, SpO2 sensor, respiration sensor, posture sensor, stress sensor, and
asthma inhaler can each be separate devices. While specific examples are provided, it should be
appreciated that other sensors can be used and other combinations of sensors can be combined
into a single device.
[0030]    Sensors 102, 104, 106, and 108 can be used to measure wellness or non-wellness data
continuously, intermittently, periodically, or at any other desired frequency or interval of time.
For example, sensors 102, 104, 106, and 108 can be used to obtain a single measurement or
                                                   6

                                                                                              1002085170
multiple measurements over a length of time. Additionally, sensors 102, 104, 106, 108 can be
used to measure wellness or non-wellness data at any time or location desired by the user.
Moreover, sensors 102, 104, 106, and 108 can be used with or without the supervision of a
healthcare provider. For example, a user can use sensors 102, 104, 106, and 108 to obtain sensor
measurements at home without the supervision of a medical professional.
[0031]    In some examples, user device 110 can include software sensor applications 113 (e.g.,
third party applications) associated with each of sensors 102, 104, 106, and 108 for interfacing
with the sensors to allow user device 110 to receive the wellness or non-wellness data. In these
examples, the applications 113 can use the device's APIs to store the wellness or non-wellness
data in the wellness database 111 of user device 110. In some examples, the software sensor
applications 113 can be Apps and device 110 can be a smart phone, tablet computer, or the like.
It should be understood that "third party" can correspond to an entity different than the
manufacturer of device 110 and/or the entity that created and/or maintains the operating system
of device 110. In these instances, third party applications and their corresponding sensors can
communicate and function within the operating system of device 110 according to a predefined
device protocol associated with device 110.
[0032]    The applications 113 can similarly use the device's APIs to access data stored in the
wellness database 111. In other examples, user device 110 can be configured to share one or
more communication formats with sensors 102, 104, 106, and 108 to allow user device 110 to
receive and interpret the wellness or non-wellness data from the sensors. The received data can
then be stored in the wellness database 111 of user device 110.
[0033]    User device 110 can further receive wellness or non-wellness data from its own
wellness or non-wellness data sensors 115, such as a GPS sensor, clock, gyroscope,
accelerometer, or the like, from a user interacting with user device 110, from another entity, such
as a physician, or from other non-sensor sources. For example, using the device's APIs,
wellness or non-wellness data can be received from applications 117 on user device 110, such as
a clock application, a calendaring application, a gaming application, an application from a
healthcare provider, a messaging application, or the like. The wellness or non-wellness data
from the applications 117 can originate from a user interacting with the applications, a remote
database (e.g., database for a medical website), a healthcare provider institution (e.g., via the
institution's App), or the like. In these examples, the usage of the application 117 (e.g., how
                                                  7

                                                                                             1002085170
long you play a video game application, when you play the video game, number of times
interacting with a stock application, number of times interacting with a social networking
application, length of time interacting with a social networking application, etc.), usage of user
device 110 (e.g., length of time on the phone or number of text messages sent as determined
from a phone payment application, time spent browsing the Internet as determined from the
device's browser, etc.), time spent listening to music as determined from a music or streaming
radio application, time spent using a remote application for controlling a television, amount of
time or money spent on shopping websites, time spent on pornographic websites (e.g., to
identify addictions), weather data from a weather application (e.g., to determine how weather
affects a user's health), type of events occurring in the user's life as determined from a calendar
(e.g., meetings, birthdays, holidays, etc.), interactions with certain people as determined from a
contact list and/or calendar application and/or a messaging application and/or phone of user
device 110, or the like, can be received by user device 110 and stored in the wellness database
111.
[0034]    In some examples, default or user-selected settings can be provided to restrict the
access that at least one application (e.g., at least one of applications 113 and 117) on user device
110 has to the wellness database 111 of user device 110 (for both storage and retrieval purposes)
and to the sensor data generated by sensors 115 within user device 110 and/or sensor data
generated by sensors 102, 104, 106, and 108. For example, an application for tracking a user's
running sessions can be granted access to the data generated by the GPS sensor of user device
110, but can be prevented from accessing the user's blood pressure data stored in the wellness
database 111. In some examples, an entity other than the owner of user device 110 can set the
authorization settings for various applications on user device 110. For example, the
manufacturer of user device 110 and/or the entity that created and/or maintains the operating
system of user device 110 can evaluate the applications to determine if they should be given
access to the user's wellness data and/or sensor data generated or received by user device 110.
In some examples, these settings can be overridden by the user.
[0035]    FIG. lB illustrates system 100B for sharing user wellness data. Referring to FIG. IB,
system 100B can include registry server 118 communicatively coupled to user device 110 via
network 112, which can include the Internet, an intranet, or any other wired or wireless public or
private network. In the case in which a user of device 110 wishes to do so by opting into data
                                                     8

                                                                                            1002085170
sharing, user device 110 can be configured to securely transmit the received wellness or non
wellness data and associated metadata stored in wellness database 111 to registry server 118 for
storage in registry database 120. The user of device 110 can opt into sharing some or all of their
wellness and non-wellness data. For example, a user can choose to share all wellness and non
wellness data, only certain types of wellness or non-wellness data, or a subset of a type of
wellness or non-wellness data. Registry database 120 can be used to store wellness or non
wellness data associated with a large number of users for the purpose of providing researchers
with access to a large volume of wellness data that would not otherwise be available to them.
For privacy reasons, registry database 120 can be configured to securely store a user's wellness
or non-wellness data anonymously (e.g., without identifying and/or personal information about
the user, such as a legal name, username, time and location data, or the like). Additionally, the
wellness or non-wellness data can only be included within registry database 120 (or,
alternatively, made searchable) with the user's authorization by, for example, opting into a data
sharing program. Absent such an authorization, the user's wellness or non-wellness data may be
excluded from registry database 120 (e.g., by not storing the user's wellness or non-wellness
data in registry database 120). In some examples, the identifiers for users in registry database
120 can be different for each querying entity. For example, a first research entity may be
provided with an identifier having a value of 37 for one of the users in registry database 120,
while a second research entity may be provided with an identifier having a value of 82 for the
same user. This can be done to prevent collusion between researchers. The operation of registry
database 120 will be discussed in greater detail below with respect to FIGs. 2-3.
[0036]    System 100B can further include any number of other user devices 122 and 124
coupled to network 112. In some examples, user devices 122 and 124 can be operated by the
same user as user device 110. In these instances, the user can transmit their wellness or non
wellness data to registry server 118 for storage in registry database 120 using appropriate
credentials. Additionally, in some examples, a user's wellness data can by synced between
registry database 120 and one or more of user devices 110, 122, and 124. In other examples, the
user of user devices 122 and 124 can be a person that is different than the user of user device
110. In these examples, the users of devices 122 and 124 cannot access the wellness or non
wellness data of the user of user device 110 within registry database 120. While not shown, it
should be appreciated that many other user devices can be coupled to registry server 118 through
                                                  9

                                                                                              1002085170
network 112 to collect and store wellness or non-wellness data for other users in a manner
similar to that described above.
REGISTRY DATABASE
[0037]     As discussed above, registry database 120 can be used to store wellness or non
wellness data from a large number (e.g., millions) of users upon their authorization. Researchers
can then request access to the wellness or non-wellness data for the purpose of performing
medical research. Providing researchers with a reliable stream of constantly updating sensor
data for millions of users can allow the researchers to conduct faster and more accurate studies.
[0038]      For privacy reasons, different levels of authorization can be used to control access to
the data contained in registry database 120. Once a user authorizes some or all of their wellness
or non-wellness data to be accessed by adding their data to registry database 120, the user or
another entity, such as a review board associated with registry database 120, can provide
researchers or querying entities with various levels of authorization to access the registry data.
In a first level of authorization, a querying entity can be given access to certain types of wellness
data, such as blood pressure and height, for all registry participants. Under this level of
authorization, the querying entity's access to data contained in registry database 120 can be
limited to the types of data specified by the authorization. In some examples, the
owner/operator of registry database 120 can perform queries submitted by querying entities to
further limit the access the researchers have to the wellness or non-wellness data contained in
registry database 120.
[0039]      In a second level of authorization, a querying entity can be given limited access to data
that allows the querying entity to identify potential study participants, generate population level
histograms, or the like. Under this level of authorization, if the querying entity desires more
detailed information about specific user records, then an explicit authorization from the
associated users may be required. The authorization from the user can be received in response to
a request made by the querying entity and sent to the user by registry server 118. The request
can include a link or other selectable element that can allow the user to quickly opt-in to the
study, thereby granting access to the user's wellness or non-wellness data. The link or other
selectable element can be part of a user interface associated with an App from applications 113
or 117 that can be associated with one or more types of wellness, non-wellness, or sensor data.
                                                   10

                                                                                               1002085170
[0040]    Users can also proactively provide explicit authorization to some or all of their
wellness data to selected research studies. For example, users can search for certain studies by
searching, using a computing device (e.g., user device 110), through a displayed list of research
studies stored by registry server 118, selecting a research study of interest from the list via a user
input to the computing device, and making a selection by providing a user input to the
computing device to opt-in to participate in the study. This authorization can then be transmitted
from user device 110 to registry server 118 via network 112, thereby granting access to the
research entity performing the research study of interest. In another example, a user can provide
registry server 118 with information about the type(s) of research studies that may be of interest
to the user. For example, the user may select from a displayed list of types of illnesses, types of
data, and the like (e.g., high blood pressure, colon cancer, heart disease, activity data, and the
like), and select from the displayed list via a user input to the computing device, the type of
illnesses studies that they are interested in participating in. Registry server 118 can monitor a
current list of research studies being conducted to identify studies that match the user's
preferences and can send notifications to potentially interested users via network 112 and user
device 110. The notifications can be displayed on the user's device as an email, text, message,
banner, badge, or the like, and can include a link or other selectable element that, when selected
by the user, can allow the user to quickly opt-in to the study, thereby granting the entity
associated with the study access to the user's wellness or non-wellness data.
[0041]     In some examples, the querying entity can request additional data not contained in the
registry database from the users. This request can be sent by the research entity or the
owner/operator of the registry server (e.g., via registry server 118) to a device (e.g., user device
110) of the user. If the user agrees to participate, the user's registry identification can be
revealed to the querying entity to allow the querying entity to combine the user's registry data
with the requested additional data.
[0042]     FIG. 2 illustrates an example process that can be used to perform queries on registry
database 120. At block 202, an owner or operator of a registry database similar or identical to
database 120 can receive a request to access wellness or non-wellness data stored in the registry.
The request can be received by registry server 118 via network 112 or can be received through
another communication medium (e.g., paper application request, telephone, in-person, or the
like). The requesting research entity can, in some examples, be a part of an institution, such as a
                                                   11

                                                                                             1002085170
university, company, or the like, and can first request and receive approval for performing the
research study from an internal review board. To illustrate, FIG. 3 shows a block diagram
depicting an example query interaction 300 that can occur when performing queries on registry
database 120 using process 200. As shown, research entity 302 can submit a request for
approval of a research study to an institutional review board 304. The institutional review board
304 can review the merits of the study and either approve or deny the request. If approved, the
research entity can submit a request to access one or more types of approved data contained in
registry database 120. This request can be received by the owner/operator of registry database
120 (e.g., system review board 306).
[0043]     Referring back to FIG. 2, at block 204, the owner/operator of registry database 120 can
evaluate the request to determine if access to the wellness or non-wellness data should be
granted. This can include evaluating the entity submitting the request, the proposed research
study, the type or amount of data requested, or the like. If the request is denied, the process can
return to block 202 where additional requests for access to the wellness or non-wellness data can
be received from the same or other research entities. If, however, the request is granted, the
process can proceed to block 206.
[0044]    At block 206, a search query to be performed on the registry database can be received.
The request can include any number of search parameters related to the types of wellness or non
wellness data and the metadata stored in the registry database. The search query can be
evaluated to determine if it violates any search query rules (if any exist). For example, search
queries can be rejected if they would too narrowly characterize the user, such that the user's
identity can be determined or inferred. If the search query is approved, the owner/operator of
the registry database can execute the search query on the registry database. In some examples,
before the search query can be executed on users' data in the registry data, authorizations from
the users to allow their data to be searchable can be received. In these examples, if no
authorization is received from a user, the search query request to search the user's data can be
denied and the search query may not be executed on the user's data. To illustrate, referring
again to FIG. 3, research entity 302 can submit a query request to system review board 306 for a
query to be run on registry database 120. If approved by system review board 306, the query
can be executed on the wellness and non-wellness data in the registry database of users that
provided authorizations to allow their data to be searchable.
                                                  12

                                                                                               1002085170
[0045]     Referring back to FIG. 2, at block 208, the results of the search query can be provided
to the requesting research entity. The results can include any desired amount of wellness or non
wellness data resulting from the search query. For example, the results can include only a list of
anonymous identifiers for users that match the search query. Depending on the authorization
settings, the research entity can then request that notifications be sent to the matching users,
asking them if they would like to participate in the research study. In other examples, some or
all of the wellness or non-wellness data associated with matching users can be provided to the
requesting research entity. The amount of data can depend on the preferences of the
owner/operator of the registry server, level of authorization provided by the users, terms of the
agreement between the research entity and the owner/operator of registry server 120, or the like.
In some examples, if authorized by the user, the research entity can request additional data not
contained in the registry database from the users. This request can be sent by the research entity
or the owner/operator of the registry server (e.g., via registry server 118) to a device (e.g., user
device 110) of the user.
[0046]     To illustrate, referring again to FIG. 3, the search query can be performed on registry
database 120 and the results of the query can be transmitted to research entity 302. While shown
as being sent directly from registry database 120 to research entity 302, it should be appreciated
that a server, such as registry server 118, can be used to transmit the query results to research
entity 302.
[0047]     In some examples, before or after any blocks of process 200, the contents of the
registry database can be updated. In these examples, the wellness or non-wellness data from
one, two, or more users can be received by the registry's server (e.g., registry server 118) from
the device(s) of the user(s). For example, the wellness or non-wellness data can be stored on
wellness database 111 of user device 110 and can be transmitted to registry server 118 via
network 112. In response to receiving the wellness or non-wellness data, the registry database
can be updated to include the received wellness or non-wellness data. In some examples, user
devices of users that store wellness or non-wellness data in the registry database can transmit
updates to the users' wellness or non-wellness data periodically, intermittently, continuously, or
at any other desired interval of time.
[0048]     In some examples, user device 110 or another computing device can display an
interface for searching for research studies in which a user can participate. The interface can
                                                    13

                                                                                              1002085170
include a list of one or more possible research studies in which a user can participate. The
interface can allow a user to search for particular research studies based on any desired criteria,
such as location, entity conducting the study, the subject of the study, or the like. In some
examples, the interface can include one or more recommended studies that the user is
particularly qualified to participate in based on the user's wellness data stored in the registry.
For example, if the user's wellness data in registry database 120 indicates that the user is a male
with brown hair, diabetes, and over the age of 50, the research study search interface can
recommend diabetes research studies that are looking for participants having those traits. In
some examples, the interface can include a button or other selectable element that a user can
select to make their wellness data in registry database 120 available for use in the selected
research study.
[0049]     FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary process 400 for managing access to a health registry
according to various examples. At block 402, an authorization to provide access to wellness or
non-wellness data in a registry database similar or identical to registry database 120 can be
received. In some examples, the request can be received by a server (e.g., registry server 118)
associated with the registry database from a computing device similar or identical to user device
110, 122, or 124. The authorization can include an indication of a user's desire to opt in to a
sharing program.
[0050]     In one example, the authorization can indicate that the user authorizes research entities
to perform queries (e.g., using process 200) on some or all of the user's data. For example, the
authorization can indicate that all of the user's data can be queried, certain types of the user's
data can be queried, or a subset of a type of the user's data can be queried.
[0051]     In another example, the authorization can be received in response to a request made by
the querying entity and sent to the user by the registry server. The request can include a link or
other selectable element that can allow the user to quickly opt-in to the study, thereby granting
access to the user's wellness or non-wellness data. The link or other selectable element can be
part of a user interface associated with an App from applications (e.g., applications 113 or 117)
that can be associated with one or more types of wellness, non-wellness, or sensor data.
[0052]     In other examples, the authorization can include an explicit authorization to some or all
of the user's data to selected research studies. For example, the user can search for certain
                                                  14

                                                                                               1002085170
studies by searching, using the computing device, through a displayed list of research studies
stored by the registry server, selecting a research study of interest from the list via user input to
the computing device, and making a selection by providing a user input to the computing device
to opt-in to participate in the research study. An authorization for an entity associated with the
selected research study to access the user's data can be transmitted to the registry server.
[0053]     In another example, the user can provide the registry server with information about the
type(s) of research studies that may be of interest to the user. For example, the user may select
from a displayed list of types of illnesses, types of data, and the like (e.g., high blood pressure,
colon cancer, heart disease, activity data, and the like) and select from the displayed list via a
user input to the computing device, the type of illnesses studies they are interested in
participating in. The registry server can monitor a current list of research studies being
conducted to identify studies that match the user's preferences and can send notifications to
potentially interested users via a network (e.g., network 112) and the user's computing device.
The notifications can be displayed on the user's device as an e-mail, a text, a message, a banner,
a badge or the like and can include a link or other selectable element that, when selected by the
user, can allow the user to quickly opt-in to the study, thereby granting the entity associated with
the study access to the user's wellness or non-wellness data. In response to the user's selection,
an authorization granting the entity access to the user's wellness data can be transmitted to the
registry server.
[0054]    At block 404, access to the wellness and non-wellness data in the registry server can be
provided based on the authorization received at block 402. In some examples, this can include
allowing research entities to query the data using, for example, process 200. In other examples,
this can include providing a particular entity identified in the authorization with access to the
user's data. If, however, no authorization was received to provide access to a user's data at
block 402, any requests to query or access the user's data can be denied.
[0055]     One or more of the functions relating to receiving and sharing wellness data can be
performed by a system similar or identical to system 500 shown in FIG. 5. System 500 can
include instructions stored in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium, such as
memory 504 or storage device 502, and executed by processor 506. The instructions can also be
stored and/or transported within any non-transitory computer readable storage medium for use
by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a
                                                  15

                                                                                           1002085170
computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the
instructions from the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device and execute the
instructions. In the context of this document, a "non-transitory computer readable storage
medium" can be any medium that can contain or store the program for use by or in connection
with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The non-transitory computer
readable storage medium can include, but is not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical,
electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus or device, a portable computer
diskette (magnetic), a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable
programmable read-only memory (EPROM) (magnetic), a portable optical disc such a CD, CD
R, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-R, or DVD-RW, or flash memory such as compact flash cards, secured
digital cards, USB memory devices, memory sticks, and the like.
[0056]    The instructions can also be propagated within any transport medium for use by or in
connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer-based
system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the instructions from the
instruction execution system, apparatus, or device and execute the instructions. In the context of
this document, a "transport medium" can be any medium that can communicate, propagate or
transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system,
apparatus, or device. The transport medium can include, but is not limited to, an electronic,
magnetic, optical, electromagnetic or infrared wired or wireless propagation medium.
[0057]    In some examples, system 500 can be included within user device 110 or registry
server 118. Processor 506 can be configured to perform process 200 or 400. It is to be
understood that the system is not limited to the components and configuration of FIG. 5 but can
include other or additional components in multiple configurations according to various
examples.
