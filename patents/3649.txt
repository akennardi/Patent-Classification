PROCEDURES
ABSTRACT
       A surgical instrument (10) includes a housing (20), a shaft (80) extending therefrom, an
end effector assembly (100) supported by the shaft (80), a movable handle (40), and a drive
assembly (140). The drive assembly (140) includes a translatable drive member (142) for
actuating the end effector assembly (100), and a torsion spring (160) including first and second
legs (161, 162). The first leg (161) is configured to translate through the housing (20) in
response to movement of the movable handle (40) relative to the housing (20). The second leg
(162) is configured to translate through the housing (20) in cooperation with the first leg (161) to
move the drive member (142) longitudinally when a force acting on the drive member (142) is
less than a threshold force, and to remain in fixed position, thereby tensioning the torsion spring
(160) and retaining the drive member (142) in fixed position when the force acting on the drive
member (142) is equal to or exceeds the threshold force.

SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS FOR PERFORMING
TONSILLECTOMY, ADENOIDECTOMY, AND OTHER SURGICAL
PROCEDURES
[0001]        The present application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application
No. <removed-apn>, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
Field
[0002]        The present disclosure relates to surgical instruments and methods and, more
particularly, to surgical instrument and methods for performing tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy,
and other surgical procedures.
Background
[0003]        The tonsils and adenoids are part of the lymphatic system and are generally located
in the back of the throat. These parts of the lymphatic system are generally used for sampling
bacteria and viruses entering the body and activating the immune system when warranted to
produce antibodies to fight oncoming infections.       More particularly, the tonsils and adenoids
break down the bacteria or virus and send pieces of the bacteria or virus to the immune system to
produce antibodies for fighting off infections.
[0004]        Inflammation of the tonsils and adenoids (e.g., tonsillitis) impedes the ability of the
tonsils and adenoids to destroy the bacteria resulting in a bacterial infection. In many instances,
the bacteria remain even after treatment and serve as a reservoir for repeated infections (e.g.,
tonsillitis or ear infections).
[0005]        A tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy may be performed when infections persist
and antibiotic treatments fail. Persistent infection typically leads to enlarged tonsil tissue which
may need to be removed since in many cases the enlarged tissue causes airway obstruction
leading to various sleep disorders such as snoring or, in some cases, sleep apnea. Some
individuals are also born with larger tonsils that are more prone to cause obstruction.           An
adenoidectomy may also be required to remove adenoid tissue when ear pain persists, or when
nose breathing or function of the Eustachian tube is impaired. Often times, tonsillectomy and
adenoidectomy procedures are performed at the same time.

                                                   2
Object
[0006]       It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or ameliorate one or
more of the above disadvantages, or at least provide a useful alternative.
Summary
[0007]       As used herein, the term "distal" refers to the portion that is being described which is
further from a user, while the term "proximal" refers to the portion that is being described which
is closer to a user. Further, to the extent consistent, any of the aspects described herein may be
used in conjunction with any or all of the other aspects described herein.
[0008]       A surgical instrument provided in accordance with the present disclosure includes a
housing, a shaft extending distally from the housing, an end effector assembly coupled at a distal
end of the shaft, a movable handle coupled to the housing, and a drive assembly operably
coupling the movable handle and the end effector assembly. The drive assembly includes a
drive member and a torsion spring. The drive member is configured to translate through the
shaft and relative to the end effector assembly to actuate the end effector assembly. The torsion
spring includes a first leg and a second leg. The first leg is operably coupled to the movable
handle and configured to translate longitudinally through the housing in response to movement
of the movable handle relative to the housing. The second leg is operably coupled to the drive
member and configured to translate longitudinally through the housing in cooperation with the
first leg to thereby transfer longitudinal movement thereof into longitudinal movement of the
drive member when a force acting on the drive member is less than a threshold force.             The
second leg is configured to remain in fixed position, thereby tensioning the torsion spring and
retaining the drive member in fixed position, in response to longitudinal movement of the first
leg when the force acting on the drive member is equal to or exceeds the threshold force.
[0009]        In an aspect of the present disclosure, the drive assembly further includes a slider
including a housing portion operably retaining the torsion spring therein and a mandrel portion
operably coupled to the movable handle.         The slider is configured to translate longitudinally
through the housing in response to movement of the movable handle relative to the housing.
[0010]       In another aspect of the present disclosure, the first leg of the torsion spring is
engaged with the housing portion of the slider and the second leg of the torsion spring is
movable relative to the housing portion of the slider. In such aspects, a body portion of the

                                                   3
torsion spring may be rotatably supported on a post disposed within the housing portion of the
slider.   The post is configured to enable tensioning of the torsion spring in response to
movement of the first leg relative to the second leg.
[0011]        In another aspect of the present disclosure, the first leg of the torsion spring is
operably positioned relative to a block disposed within the housing to bias the drive member
relative to the housing.
[0012]        In yet another aspect of the present disclosure, the movable handle is movable
relative to the housing between an initial position, a compressed position, and an activated
position. The second leg is configured to translate in cooperation with the first leg in response
to movement of the movable handle between the initial and compressed positions. The second
leg is configured to remain in fixed position in response to movement of the movable handle
between the compressed and activated positions.
[0013]        In still another aspect of the present disclosure, the end effector assembly includes
first and second jaw members, at least one of which is movable relative to the other between a
spaced-apart position and an approximated position for grasping tissue therebetween. In such
aspects, the drive member may be configured to translate through the shaft and relative to the
end effector assembly to move the first and second jaw members between the spaced-apart and
approximated positions.
[0014]        In another aspect of the present disclosure, at least one of the first and second jaw
members is adapted to connect to a source of energy for treating tissue grasped therebetween. In
such aspects, an energy activation assembly disposed on the housing may also be provided. The
energy activation assembly includes a switch configured to supply energy to the first and/or
second jaw members. Further, the movable handle may be movable relative to the housing
between an initial position, a compressed position, and an activated position. The second leg of
the torsion spring is configured to remain in fixed position in response to movement of the
movable handle between the compressed and activated positions and, in the activated position, at
least a portion of the handle is configured to contact the energy activation assembly to activate
the switch.
[0015]        In still another aspect of the present disclosure, the second leg is configured to
translate in cooperation with the first leg in response to movement of the movable handle

                                                   4
between the initial and compressed positions for applying an appropriate closure force to tissue
grasped therebetween in the compressed position. Further, the appropriate closure pressure may
be maintained, e.g., via tensioning of the torsion spring, during movement of the movable handle
between the compressed and activated positions.
[0016]       In yet another aspect of the present disclosure, the torsion spring is pre-loaded to a
less-tensioned state and wherein, in response to longitudinal movement of the first leg when the
force acting on the drive member is equal to or exceeds the threshold force, the torsion spring is
further tensioned to a more-tensioned state.
[0017]       Another surgical instrument provided in accordance with aspects of the present
disclosure includes a movable handle, a drive member, a torsion spring, and a slider.            The
torsion spring includes a body, a first leg, and a second leg. The second leg of the torsion spring
is engaged to the drive member. The slider includes a housing and a mandrel. The housing
includes a post rotatably supporting the body of the torsion spring thereon.         The housing is
configured to permit movement of the second leg of the torsion spring relative to the housing.
The mandrel extends from the housing and is operably coupled to the movable handle such that
movement of the movable handle longitudinally translates the slider. When a force acting on the
drive member is less than a threshold force, the slider and the second leg of the torsion spring
are configured to translate longitudinally through the housing in cooperation with one another in
response to movement of the movable handle, thereby transferring longitudinal movement of the
slider into longitudinal movement of the drive member. When the force acting on the drive
member is equal to or exceeds the threshold force, the torsion spring is tensioned in response to
movement of the movable handle such that the second leg of the torsion spring and the drive
member remain in fixed position during longitudinal movement of the slider.
[0018]       In an aspect of the present disclosure, the surgical instrument further includes an end
effector assembly operably coupled to the drive member. In such aspects, the drive member is
configured to translate relative to the end effector assembly to actuate the end effector assembly.
[0019]       In another aspect of the present disclosure, the end effector assembly includes first
and second jaw members. At least one of the first and second jaw members is movable relative
to the other between a spaced-apart position and an approximated position for grasping tissue
therebetween in response to translation of the drive member relative to the end effector
assembly.

                                                    5
[0020]       In still another aspect of the present disclosure, the force acting on the drive member
corresponds to a closure pressure applied to tissue grasped between the first and second jaw
members.
[0021]       In yet another aspect of the present disclosure, the movable handle is movable
relative to the housing between an initial position, a compressed position, and an activated
position. In such aspects, the slider and the second leg of the torsion spring are configured to
translate longitudinally through the housing in cooperation with one another in response to
movement of the movable handle between the initial and compressed positions. The second leg
of the torsion spring and the drive member remain in fixed position during longitudinal
movement of the slider in response to movement of the movable handle between the compressed
and activated positions.
[0022]       In still yet another aspect of the present disclosure, at least one of the first and
second jaw members is adapted to connect to a source of energy for treating tissue grasped
between the first and second jaw members. In such aspects, energy may be supplied to the at
least one of the first and second jaw members in response to movement of the movable handle to
the activated position.
[0023]       In an aspect of the present disclosure, the housing retains the first end of the torsion
spring in fixed relation relative to the housing. Alternatively, the first leg of the torsion spring
may be operably positioned to bias the drive member in a longitudinal direction.

Description of Embodiments
[0077]        Referring generally to FIGS. 1-12, a surgical instrument provided in accordance with
the present disclosure is shown generally identified by reference numeral 10. Instrument 10, as
described below, is configured for grasping, treating, and/or dissecting tissue and may find
particular applicability for use in performing tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy procedures,
although use of instrument 10 in various other surgical procedures is also contemplated and
within the scope of the present disclosure.
[0078]        With reference to FIGS, 1, 7, 8, and 12, instrument 10 generally includes a housing
20, a handle assembly 30, a trigger assembly 70, a shaft 80, an end effector assembly 100, a
drive assembly 140, a knife assembly 170, and an energy activation assembly 190. As detailed
below, shaft 80 extends distally from housing 20 and supports end effector assembly 100 at
distal end 85 thereof, drive assembly 140 operably couples handle assembly 30 with end effector
assembly 100 to enable selective manipulation of jaw members 110, 120 of end effector
assembly 100, knife assembly 170 is operably coupled with trigger assembly 70 to enable
selective translation of a knife blade 174 of knife assembly 170 relative to end effector assembly

                                                   11
100, and energy activation assembly 190 enables energy to be selectively delivered to end
effector assembly 100.
[0079]       Instrument 10 may also include an electrosurgical cable (not shown) that connects
instrument 10 to a generator (not shown) or other suitable power source, although instrument 10
may alternatively be configured as a battery-powered instrument.        The electrosurgical cable
includes lead wires, e.g., lead wires 107 (FIG. 12), extending therethrough that have sufficient
length to extend through housing 20 and shaft 80 in order to operably couple the generator,
energy activation assembly 190, and end effector assembly 100 with one another to enable the
selective supply of energy to electrically-conductive plates 112, 122 of jaw members 110, 120 of
end effector assembly 100, e.g., upon activation of activation switch 194 of energy activation
assembly 190.
[0080]       Referring to FIGS. 1-7, housing 20 houses the internal working components of
instrument 10 and is formed from first and second housing components 22a, 22b configured to
engage one another via a plurality of pin-aperture engagements 23 spaced around the perimeter
of housing 20. Housing 20 defines a pistol-style configuration having a longitudinally-extending
barrel portion 24 and a fixed handle portion 26 that extends from barrel portion 24 in generally
perpendicular orientation relative thereto.
[0081]       Housing 20, movable handle 40 of handle assembly 30, and trigger 72 of trigger
assembly 70 are ergonomically configured to enable operable grasping of instrument 10 in a
plurality of different positions. Housing 20, more specifically, defines an elongated indentation
27 within barrel portion 24 on either side thereof, while a waist 28 is recessed annularly about
handle portion 26 adjacent the interconnection between handle portion 26 and barrel portion 24.
Movable handle 40, more specifically, defines a grasping portion 42 having an elongated
proximal leg 43 that extends the length of fixed handle portion 26 of housing 20, a proximal foot
44 disposed at the free end of proximal leg 43 and angled distally relative to proximal leg 43,
and an arcuate segment 45 disposed at the opposite end of proximal leg 43 and extending
distally therefrom. Arcuate segment 45 culminates in a distal tail 46 and defines a sufficient
diameter so as to operably receive a user's finger between distal tail 46 and proximal leg 43.
Trigger 72, more specifically, includes a concave trigger surface 73 defining a saddle 74
configured to help retain a user's finger therein.

                                                  12
[0082]       With particular reference to FIGS. 4-6, and initially to FIG. 4, in a first operable
grasping position, the user's hand is positioned such that the thumb is partially received within
waist 28, the tip of the index finger extends across trigger 72 and is partially received within
saddle 74, the middle finger extends across movable handle 40 and is positioned adjacent
arcuate segment 45 of movable handle 40 between proximal leg 43 and distal tail 46, and the
ring finger and pinky are positioned distally of and adjacent to proximal leg 43. In this position,
waist 28 inhibits slipping of the thumb, saddle 74 inhibits slipping of the index finger, proximal
leg 43 and distal tail 46 retain the middle finger therebetween to enable both proximal and distal
movement of movable handle 40, proximal leg 43 provides a surface against which the ring
finger and pinky can be utilized to urge movable handle 40 proximally, and proximal foot 44
inhibits slipping of the ring finger and pinky off the free end of movable handle 40.
[0083]       Referring to FIG. 5, in a second operable grasping position, the user's hand is
positioned such that the index finger is partially received within elongated indentation 27 on the
opposite side of housing 20, the middle finger extends transversely across trigger 72 and is
partially received within saddle 74, the ring finger extends across movable handle 40 and is
positioned adjacent arcuate segment 45 of movable handle 40 between proximal leg 43 and
distal tail 46, and the pinky is positioned distally of and adjacent to proximal leg 43. In this
position, elongated indentation 27 inhibits slipping of the index finger, saddle 74 inhibits
slipping of the middle finger, proximal leg 43 and distal tail 46 retain the ring finger
therebetween to enable both proximal and distal movement of movable handle 40, and proximal
leg 43 provides a surface against which the pinky can be utilized to urge movable handle 40
proximally.
[0084]       Referring to FIG. 6, in a third operable grasping position, the user's hand is
positioned such that the thumb is wrapped around a free end of fixed handle portion 26 of
housing 20, the index finger and middle finger are positioned proximally of and adjacent the free
end of proximal leg 43 of movable handle 40, the ring finger extends across movable handle 40
and is positioned adjacent arcuate segment 45 of movable handle 40 between proximal leg 43
and distal tail 46, and the pinky extends across trigger 72 and is partially received within saddle
74. In this position, proximal foot 44 inhibits slipping of the index finger off the free end of
movable handle 40, proximal leg 43 and distal tail 46 retain the ring finger therebetween to
enable both proximal and distal movement of movable handle 40, proximal leg 43 provides a

                                                 13
surface against which the index and middle fingers can be utilized to urge movable handle 40
proximally, and saddle 74 inhibits slipping of the pinky.
[0085]       With reference to FIG. 7, fixed handle portion 26 of housing 20 defines a bay 29a
configured to receive and support energy activation assembly 190, which is operable to initiate
and terminate the delivery of energy to end effector assembly 100. Energy activation assembly
190 includes a depressible button 192 that is mechanically coupled to a switch 194 mounted
within bay 29a of fixed handle portion 26 and is engagable by a button activation post 196
extending proximally from a proximal side of movable handle 40 upon movement of the
movable handle 40 to the activated position, as detailed below. Switch 194 is configured to
electrically communicate with end effector assembly 100 and the generator (not shown) via
suitable electrical wiring, e.g., leads 107 (FIG. 12), extending through housing 20, shaft 80,
and/or an external cable (not shown) to enable energy to be supplied from the generator (not
shown) to end effector assembly 100 upon activation of switch 194.
[0086]       Referring additionally to FIG. 8, barrel portion 24 of housing 20 defines a distal
aperture 29b (FIG. 7) configured to receive proximal end 82 of shaft 80 therein, and an
engagement feature (not shown) extending inwardly from each of first and second housing
components 22a, 22b for receipt within opposed apertures 83 defined through proximal end 82
of shaft 80 for securing proximal end 82 of shaft 80 within barrel portion 24 of housing 20.
Shaft 80 extends distally from housing 20 and defines a generally rectangular cross-sectional
configuration oriented such that the larger width dimension thereof extends laterally and the
smaller height dimension thereof extends vertically. This configuration of shaft 80 relative to
the orientation of jaw members 110, 120 (FIG. 7) provides an enhanced "line-of-sight" for
visualizing the surgical site adjacent end effector assembly 100. As described in greater detail
below, shaft 80 includes a pair of spaced-apart clevis members 84 extending from the top and
bottom walls, e.g., the larger width dimension walls, of shaft 80 at distal end 85 thereof, each of
which defines an aperture 86 for receiving a pivot pin 103 to operably support end effector
assembly 100 at distal end 85 of shaft 80. In this configuration, apertures 86 are vertically
aligned with one another.      Shaft 80 further includes, as noted above, opposed apertures 83
defined through the side walls, e.g., the smaller height dimension walls, of shaft 80 at proximal
end 82 thereof for receiving engagement features (not shown) extending inwardly from first and
second housing components 22a, 22b to secure proximal end 82 of shaft 80 within housing 20.

                                                14
[0087]      Barrel portion 24 of housing further includes a pair of pivot apertures 29c, a
longitudinal track 29d (FIG. 13), a pivot boss 29e, and a retention pin 29f. Each pivot aperture
29c is defined on the inwardly-facing surface of one of first and second housing components
22a, 22b (only pivot aperture 29c of first housing component 22a is shown) and is configured to
receive pivot pin 48 to pivotably couple movable handle 40 and trigger 72 to housing 20.
Longitudinal track 29d (FIG. 13) is defined on the inwardly-facing surface of first housing
component 22a and is configured to guide translation of drive assembly 140 relative to housing
20. Pivot boss 29e extends inwardly from first housing component 22a and is configured to
pivotably couple linkage 76 of trigger assembly 70 to housing 20. Retention pin 29f extends
inwardly from first housing component 22a and is configured to retain a fixed end 71a of biasing
member 71 of trigger assembly 70 in fixed position relative to housing 20. The importance of
these features of barrel portion 24 of housing 20 will become more apparent in view of the
description below.
[0088]      Turning to FIGS. 7-13, handle assembly 30 includes a movable handle 40 that is
movable relative to fixed handle portion 26 of housing 20 between an initial position, a
compressed position, and an activated position, as explained in greater detail below, to impart
movement of jaw members 110, 120 of end effector assembly 100 between a spaced-apart
position and an approximated position for grasping tissue therebetween and for initiating the
supply of energy to end effector assembly 100 for treating grasped tissue. Movable handle 40
includes grasping portion 42, detailed above, which extends from housing 20 adjacent fixed
handle portion 26, and flange portion 47, which extends upwardly into housing 20.           Flange
portion 47 is pivotably coupled within housing 20 at the free end of flange portion 47 via pivot
pin 48. Pivot pin 48 is engaged within and extends between pivot apertures 29c of first and
second housing components 22a, 22b of housing 20 to permit movable handle 40 to pivot about
pivot pin 48 and relative to housing 20 between the initial position, the compressed position, and
the activated position. Pivot pin 48 is disposed on one side of, e.g., above, drive assembly 140,
while grasping portion 42 of movable handle 40 is disposed on the other side of, e.g., below,
drive assembly 140, to provide a mechanical advantage when actuating movable handle 40.
[0089]      Flange portion 47 of movable handle 40 further includes a cut-out 49 defined therein
and an engagement bulge 51 protruding therefrom. Cut-out 49 is configured to slidably receive
drive plate 142 of drive assembly 140 and knife plate 172 of knife assembly 170. Engagement

                                                 15
bulge 51 is configured to operably engage flange portion 47 of movable handle 40 with slider
assembly 150 of drive assembly 140, as detailed below.
[0090]       Drive assembly 140 includes drive plate 142 and slider assembly 150. Drive plate
142 extends distally from housing 20 and through shaft 80 to operably engage end effector
assembly 100 such that, as detailed below, translation of drive plate 142 through shaft 80 and
relative to end effector assembly 100 pivots jaw members 110, 120 of end effector assembly 100
between the spaced-apart and approximated positions.        Slider assembly 150 operably couples
flange portion 47 of movable handle 40 with drive plate 142 such that pivoting of movable
handle 40 between the initial position and the compressed position pivots jaw members 110, 120
of end effector assembly 100 between the spaced-apart and approximated positions, while
ensuring application of an appropriate closure force or closure force within an appropriate
closure force range to tissue grasped between jaw members 110, 120 in the approximated
position thereof.
[0091]       Slider assembly 150 includes a proximal housing 152, a distal extension 154
extending distally from proximal housing 152, and a mandrel 156 disposed at the distal end of
distal extension 154. Proximal housing 152 includes a post 153a configured to receive a torsion
spring 160 thereabout, a first slot 153b configured to retain a first leg 161 of torsion spring 160
therein in fixed relation relative thereto, and a second slot 153c configured to operably receive
second leg 162 of torsion spring 160 therein.         Proximal housing 152 further includes an
abutment rib 153d disposed thereon adjacent second slot 153c, and a flange member 153e
configured for receipt within longitudinal track 29d (FIG. 13) of first housing component 22a of
housing 20.
[0092]       Referring briefly to FIG. 11 A, another slider assembly 2150 provided in accordance
with the present disclosure is similar to slider assembly 150 (FIGS. 10-11) except for the
configuration of the proximal housing and spring; thus, only these differences are detailed
below. Proximal housing 2152 of slider assembly 2150 is configured to house a compression
spring 2160 therein. Compression spring 2160 defines a first end 2161 and a second end 2162.
First end 2161 of compression spring 2160 is engaged with a vertical plate. Second end 2162 of
compression spring 2160 is engaged with an inner wall of proximal housing 2152.              In use,
compression spring 2160 functions similar to torsion spring 160 (FIGS. 10-11), as detailed
below, except that, rather than being further tensioned via application of a torsional force

                                                  16
thereto, compression spring 2160 is further tensioned via application of a compressive force
thereto.
[0093]       Returning to FIGS. 7-13, mandrel 156, as noted above, is disposed at the distal end
of distal extension 154 of slider assembly 150. Mandrel 156 includes a pair of spaced-apart
walls 157 defining a channel 158 therebetween.           Channel 158 is configured to receive
engagement bulge 51 of flange portion 47 of movable handle 40 while permitting vertical sliding
of engagement bulge 51 within channel 158. As a result of this configuration, upon pivoting of
movable handle 40 between the initial, compressed, and activated positions, engagement bulge
51 is urged into contact with one of the walls 157 defining channel 158 to thereby translate
slider assembly 150 within housing 20. The vertical sliding of engagement bulge 51 within
channel 158 during such urging ensures that slider assembly 150 is translated longitudinally
within and relative to housing 20 despite the arcuate travel of movable handle 40 as movable
handle is pivoted about pivot pin 48 relative to housing 20.
[0094]       Drive plate 142 includes a flange 143 disposed at the proximal end thereof. Flange
143 defines an aperture 144 configured to receive second leg 162 of torsion spring 160 therein
such that translation of second leg 162 of torsion spring 160 relative to housing 20 effects
corresponding translation of drive plate 142 relative to housing 20.       With respect to slider
assembly 2150, vertical plate 2163 is engaged within a slot 2144 defined within drive plate 142
(see FIG. 11 A), and functions in a similar manner as detailed below with respect to slider
assembly 150.     Flange 143 further defines a proximal edge 145 configured to abut abutment rib
153d of proximal housing 152 in a proximal-most position of drive plate 142 relative to slider
assembly 150 to inhibit further proximal movement of drive plate 142 relative to slider assembly
150.
[0095]       Drive plate 142, as mentioned above, extends distally from housing 20 and through
shaft 80 to operably engage end effector assembly 100. Drive plate 142 is oriented similarly to
shaft 80, e.g., such that the width of drive plate 142 extends along the width dimension of shaft
80.   Drive plate 142 further defines a track edge 146 extending along a portion of each
longitudinal side thereof. Track edges 146 are configured to slidably receive knife plate 172, as
detailed below. A cam-pin aperture 147 configured to receive a cam pin 105 associated with
end effector assembly 100 is defined transversely through drive plate 142 towards the distal end

                                                 17
of drive plate 142. A mouth 149 configured to receive a pivot pin 103 associated with end
effector assembly 100 is defined at the distal end of drive plate 142.
[0096]       With momentary reference to FIG. 9A, as an alternative to providing a slider
assembly that operably retains a torsion spring therein for coupling to drive plate 142, a torsion
spring 1160 may be operably coupled between movable handle 40 and drive plate 142 without a
slider assembly. More specifically, in some embodiments, torsion spring 1160 is mounted about
a post 1153a extending transversely from movable handle 40 and includes a first leg 1161 and a
second leg 1162.     First leg 1161 of torsion spring 1160 is configured for receipt within an
aperture 1144 defined through drive plate 142 to operably couple movable handle 40 with drive
plate 142, while second leg 1162 of torsion spring 1160 is fixed relative to movable handle 40
via abutment with a protrusion 1153c thereof. In use, torsion spring 1160 operates similarly to
torsion spring 160 (FIGS. 10-11) and, thus, a separate description of the use of torsion spring
1160 is omitted as being superfluous.
[0097]       With reference to FIGS. 14-21, as mentioned above, end effector assembly 100 is
operably supported at distal end 85 of shaft 80 and includes opposing jaw members 110, 120
pivotably coupled to one another and movable relative to one another and shaft 80 between a
spaced-apart position and an approximated position for grasping tissue therebetween. Each jaw
member 110, 120 includes an electrically-conductive plate 112, 122, a jaw frame 113, 123, a
spacer 115 (only spacer 115 of jaw member 110 is shown (FIG. 21)), and an outer housing 118,
128, each of which is detailed below.      Jaw members 110, 120 define curved configurations,
wherein jaw members 110, 120 bend upwardly from a longitudinal axis of shaft 80, e.g., towards
the upper, larger width dimension wall of shaft 80.          This configuration facilitates use of
instrument 10 in tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy procedures as well as other surgical
procedures and allows for increased visualization of the surgical site in these and other
procedures. Except where specifically noted otherwise, jaw members 110, 120 define mirror
image configurations of one another.
[0098]       Jaw frames 113, 123 of jaw members 110, 120 each include a pair of spaced-apart
proximal flanges 113a, 123a and a distal jaw support 113b, 123b. Jaw frames 113, 123 are
formed via stamping and made from stainless steel, although other manufacturing processes
and/or materials for forming jaw frames 113, 123 are also contemplated. Proximal flanges 113a
of jaw member 110 are spaced-apart further than proximal flanges 123a of jaw member 120 so

                                                 18
as to allow proximal flanges 123a of jaw member 120 to be positioned between proximal flanges
 113a of jaw member 110 during assembly. Further, the proximal flanges 113a, 123a of each pair
define aligned pivot apertures 114a, 124a and aligned cam slots 114b, 124b.       Pivot pin 103 of
end effector assembly 100 is configured for vertical insertion through apertures 86 of clevis
members 84 of shaft 80 and pivot apertures 114a, 124a to pivotably couple jaw members 110,
 120 to shaft 80 and one another with jaw members 110, 120 being laterally movable, e.g., along
the larger width dimension of shaft 80, between the spaced-apart and approximated positions.
Pivot pin 103 is configured to at least partially enter mouth 149 of drive plate 142 to permit
drive plate 142 to slide further distally relative to end effector assembly 100 to a position
wherein mouth 149 of drive plate 142 at least partially surrounds pivot pin 103.
 [0099]      The cam slots 114b of proximal flanges 113a of jaw member 110 are oppositely
angled relative to the cam slots 124b of proximal flanges 123a of jaw member 120. Cam pin
 105 of end effector assembly 100 is configured for insertion through each cam slot 114b, 124b
as well as cam-pin aperture 147 of drive plate 142 to operable couple drive plate 142 with jaw
members 110, 120 such that translation of drive plate 142 relative to jaw members 110, 120
pivots jaw members 110, 120 about pivot pin 103 and relative to one another and shaft 80
between the spaced-apart and approximated positions.
 [0100]      With particular reference to FIGS. 19-21, although only the features of jaw member
 110 or jaw member 120 are described below and/or illustrated in the figures, it is noted that jaw
members 110, 120 defines a mirror-image configurations of one another (unless specifically
contradicted herein) and, thus, any description and/or illustration of one jaw member 110, 120
applies similarly to the other jaw member 110, 120.
 [0101]      Distal jaw support 113b of jaw frame 113 of jaw member 110 extends distally from
proximal flange 113a and defines a generally "L-shaped" configuration. Distal jaw support 113b
is configured to support electrically-conductive plate 112, spacer 115, and outer housing 118 of
jaw member 110 thereon. However, distal jaw support 113b do not extend distally the entire
length of jaw member 110. Rather, distal jaw support 113b defines a length of about 50% to
about 75 % of the lengths of electrically-conductive plate 112, spacer 115, and outer housing 118
such that about 25% to about 50% of the lengths of these components extend distally beyond
distal jaw support 113b.

                                                   19
[0102]       Spacer 115 ofjaw member 110 defines a generally "M-shaped" configuration, is
formed from an electrically-insulative material, and is overmolded onto distal jaw support 113b
during a first overmold, although other manufacturing processes are also contemplated. Spacer
115 defines a body 116a and a pair of wings 116b surrounding body 116a. Spacer 115 is
positioned to electrically-isolate electrically-conductive plate 112 and distal jaw support 113b
from one another. A knife slot 11 6c extends longitudinally through body 11 6a of spaced 115
and is generally centered relative to body 116a. Knife slot 116c is open only to the top of spacer
115, except for the distal portion thereof, which extends beyond distal jaw support 113b and is
open on both the top and bottom sides thereof to provide a window 11 6d. A support-receiving
channel 11 6e extends longitudinally through body 116a at a position laterally offset relative to
knife slot 116c so as to not interfere therewith. Support-receiving channel 11 6e is open to the
bottom of spacer 115 and is configured to receive the upright of the "L-shaped" distal jaw
support 113b upon the first overmolding of spacer 115 thereabout. Body 116a of spacer 115
further defines a tunnel 11 6f configured to permit passage of lead wire 107 therethrough.
[0103]       The electrically-conductive plate 112, 122 of each jaw member 110, 120 defines a
generally planar tissue-contacting surface 112a, 122a, an elongated slot 112b, 122b extending
through the respective tissue-contacting surface 112a, 122a, a pair of legs 112c, 122c extending
downwardly from each side of the respective tissue-contacting surface 112a, 122b, and a distal
edge 112d, 122d disposed at the distal end of the respective tissue-contacting surface 112a,
122a. Electrically-conductive plates 112, 122 extend from the proximal heels of jaw members
110, 120, e.g., the interface between flanges 113a, 123a and the distal portions of jaw members
110, 120, to the distal tips of jaw members 110, 120. Jaw housing 118 of jaw member 110
includes a pair of proximal tissue stops that extend therefrom about either side of jaw member
120 such that, in conjunction with the positioning of electrically-conductive plates 112, 122 at
the proximal heel of jaw members 110, 120, grasping of tissue proximally of electrically
conductive plates 112, 122 is inhibited.
[0104]       Tissue-contacting surfaces 112a, 122a define a plurality of spaced-apart recesses
112e, 122e therein that facilitate grasping tissue. Tissue-contacting surface 112a of electrically
conductive plate 112 of jaw member 110 and/or tissue-contacting surface 122a of electrically
conductive plate 122 of jaw member 120 may further include a plurality of stop members 122f
disposed thereon. Stop members 122f may be constructed of a heat-resistant ceramic deposited

                                                  20
onto the tissue-contacting surfaces 112a, 122a, an electrically non-conductive plastic molded
onto tissue-contacting surfaces 1 12a, 122a, an electrical conductive material isolated from the
respective tissue-contacting surface 1 12a, 122a, or may be formed from and/or manufactured in
any other suitable fashion.
[0105]        Each wing 116b of spacer 115 of jaw member 110 defines a slot 116g, open at the
top end thereof, that is configured for receiving one of the legs 112c of electrically-conductive
plate 112. Wire 107, which extends through tunnel 1 16f defined within spacer 115 is configured
to electrical connect to an underside of electrically-conductive plate 112 towards the distal end
thereof for enabling the selective supply of energy thereto. Wire 107 is configured to extend
proximally through shaft 80 and into housing 20, ultimately coupling to energy activation
assembly 190 (FIG. 7) and/or extending through the cable (not shown) to couple to the generator
(not shown).
[0106]        Outer housings 118, 128 are formed about jaw members 110, 120 via a second
overmold process, such that each outer housing 118, 128 partially encloses respective jaw
members 110, 120 with the exception of a portion of the distal jaw support 113b, 123b thereof
and the tissue-contacting surface 1 12a, 122a thereof, which remain exposed. Further, legs 1 12c,
122c of electrically-conductive plates 112, 122 of jaw members 110, 120 and the spacers 115
(only spacer 115 of jaw member 110 is shown) thereof each define a plurality of fill-apertures
122g (only fill-apertures 122g of electrically-conductive plate 122 of jaw member 120 are
illustrated) that, upon overmolding of outer housings 118, 128 about respective jaw members
110, 120 are filled with the overmolded material forming outer housings 118, 128 to lock the
components of each jaw member 110, 120 in an assembled condition. Further, outer housings
118, 128 define lengths extending along the sides of respective jaw members 110, 120 and
thicknesses that decrease in the proximal-to-distal direction along the lengths thereof. Outer
housings 118, 128 also define windows 119, 129 that align with and communicate with the
windows 1 16d of the respective spacers 115 (only spacer 115 of jaw member 110 is illustrated)
and the knife slots 1 12b, 122b of the respective electrically-conductive plate 112, 122 thereof so
as to define an opening 131, 132 extending through the distal portion of each jaw member 110,
120 transversely relative to the plane defined by the respective tissue-contacting surface 1 12a,
122a.

                                                  21
[0107]       With outer housings 118, 128 formed about jaw members 110, 120, respectively,
distal edges 1 12d, 122d of electrically-conductive plates 112, 122 overlap the distal ends of
outer housings 118, 128 such that, as illustrated in FIGS. 15 and 16, distal edges 1 12d, 122d can
be utilized to pinch tissue therebetween. In particular, this configuration enables pinching of
planar tissue structures that lack substantial protruding portions that would otherwise enable
grasping, such as the tissue wall illustrated in FIGS. 15 and 16.
[0108]       Referring to FIGS. 15A and 16A, jaw members 110, 120 may further be utilized to
spread and/or dissect tissue. In order to do so, with jaw members 110, 120 disposed in the
approximated position, end effector assembly 100 may be manipulated such that the distal tips
of jaw members 110, 120 are pressed into contact with tissue to be spread and/or dissected, as
shown in FIG. 15A. Thereafter, jaw members 110, 120 are moved to the spaced-apart position
such that the distal ends of outer housings 118, 128 of jaw members 110, 120, respectively, push
tissue in opposite directions, thus spreading and/or dissecting tissue. Various configurations of
the distal ends of outer housings 118, 128 of jaw members 110, 120 to further facilitate
spreading and/or dissecting tissue are detailed below. As also detailed below, drive assembly
140 (FIG. 12) defines a pre-loaded configuration wherein drive assembly 140 (FIG. 12) is
always under tension, such that backlash upon moving jaw members 110, 120 from the
approximated position back to the spaced-apart position is eliminated. Such a configuration
facilitates spreading and/or dissecting tissue by allowing for a more smooth and consistent
transition of jaw members 110, 120 from the approximated position back to the spaced-apart
position.
[0109]       Turning to FIGS. 15B, 15B', and 16B, in some embodiments, the distal ends of outer
housings 118, 128 of jaw members 110, 120 define cut-outs that form shelves 1 18b, 128b
between the distal ends of outer housings 118, 128 and the body portions 1 18a, 128a of housings
118, 128, respectively. Shelves 1 18b, 128b, as shown in FIGS. 15B, 15B', and 16B facilitate the
retention of tissue via the distal ends of outer housings 118, 128, thus inhibiting slipping of
tissue and facilitating spreading and/or dissecting tissue.
[0110]       Referring to FIGS. 15C, 15C', and 16C, in some embodiments, in addition to or as
an alternative to including shelves 1 18b, 128b, the distal ends of outer housings 118, 128 of jaw
members 110,120 define extensions 1 18c, 128c that are relatively narrow and relatively small
radiused as compared to body portions 1 18a, 128a of housings 118, 128. These extensions 1 18c,

                                                   22
 128c facilitate pressing the distal ends of jaw members 110, 120 further into tissue (see FIG.
 15C) to ensure a relatively large contact area of tissue against shelves 1 18b, 128b upon moving
jaw members 110, 120 to the spaced-apart position (see FIG. 16C), thus facilitating the
spreading and/or dissecting of tissue.
 [0111]       With reference to FIGS. 15D, 15D', and 16D, in some embodiments, the distal ends
of outer housings 118, 128 ofjaw members 110, 120 are cut-back to define angled surfaces
 11 8d, 128d that define an angle "4" relative to the perpendicular extending from the distal ends
of jaw members 110, 120 (see FIG. 16D). Angled surfaces 1 18d, 128d, similarly as with the
previous embodiments, facilitate the pressing of the distal ends of jaw members 110, 120 further
into tissue (see FIG. 15D) as well as the retention of tissue while spreading and/or dissecting
tissue.
 [0112]       Referring again to FIGS. 7-12, trigger assembly 70, as mentioned above, is operably
coupled to knife assembly 170 to enable selective translation of knife blade 174 of knife
assembly 170 relative to end effector assembly 100. Trigger assembly 70 includes trigger 72 and
a linkage 76. Trigger 72 includes a grasping portion 75a which includes the concave trigger
surface 73, a pivot extension 75b extending upwardly from grasping portion 75a, and a proximal
extension 75c extending proximally from grasping portion 75a. Grasping portion 75a also
includes a tab 75d extending distally therefrom. Tab 75d defines an aperture 75e configured to
retain movable end 71b of biasing member 71 therein. As noted above, fixed end 71a of biasing
member 71 is engaged via retention pin 29f of first housing component 22a of housing 20. In
this manner, biasing member 71 serves to bias trigger 72 distally towards an un-actuated
position (FIG. 35).
 [0113]       Pivot extension 75b of trigger 72 is pivotably coupled to housing 20 via pivot pin 48,
which is engaged within and extends between pivot apertures 29c of first and second housing
components 22a, 22b of housing 20. It is noted that pivot pin 48 is shared by both trigger 72 and
movable handle 40; that is, both trigger 72 and movable handle 40 are pivotable about the same
point relative to housing 20. Proximal extension 75c of trigger 72 includes a post 75f that, as
detailed below, is operably engaged within cam slot 77e of linkage 76.
 [0114]       Linkage 76 serves to operably couple trigger 72 with knife assembly 170 such that
pivoting of trigger 72 from the un-actuated position (FIG. 35) to the actuated position (FIG. 36)

                                                   23
advances knife blade 174 relative to end effector assembly 100 to cut tissue grasped between jaw
members 110, 120, as detailed below. Linkage 76 defines a generally triangular-shaped
configuration including an apex 77a pointing in a distal direction and a base defining upper and
lower corners 77b, 77c, respectively. Apex 77a includes a peg 77d that is configured for receipt
within pivot boss 29e of first housing component 22a to pivotably couple linkage 76 relative to
housing 20 about apex 77a thereof. A cam slot 77e, 77f is defined through linkage 76 adjacent
upper and lower corners 77b, 77c, respectively. A coupling pin 78 operably couples cam slot
77e with knife plate 172 of knife assembly 170. More specifically, coupling pin 78 includes a
cap 79a defining a slot 79c (FIG. 9) configured to receive finger 173 of knife plate 172 and a rod
79b that is operably engaged within cam slot 77e. As noted above, post 75f of proximal
extension 75c of trigger 72 is operably engaged within cam slot 77f.
[0115]       As a result of the above-detailed configuration of trigger assembly 70, pivoting of
trigger 72 between the un-actuated and actuated positions (FIGS. 35 and 36, respectively) urges
linkage 76 to pivot relative to housing 20 ultimately such that coupling pin 78 is urged to
translate longitudinally within and relative to housing 20. As finger 173 of knife plate 172 is
engaged with coupling pin 78, such longitudinal translation of coupling pin 78 is imparted to
knife plate 172 for translating knife blade 174 between retracted and extended positions (FIGS.
29-34 and 38-40, respectively) relative to end effector assembly 100, as detailed below.
[0116]       Knife assembly 170, as noted above, includes a knife plate 172 defining a finger 173
at the proximal end thereof. Knife plate 172 extends distally through housing 20 and shaft 80
atop drive plate 142 and is slidably engaged therewith via receipt of each end of knife plate 172
within track edges 146 of drive plate 142. Knife assembly 170 further includes knife blade 174
integrally formed with or otherwise engaged to knife plate 172 and extending distally therefrom.
Knife blade 174 defines a width less than the combined thickness ofjaw members 110, 120 at
the proximal ends thereof but greater than or equal to the combined thickness of jaw members
110, 120 at the distal ends thereof. Knife blade 174 further defines an elongated opening 176
extending longitudinally therethrough. Elongated opening 176 permits knife blade 174 to be
slidably disposed about pivot pin 103 and cam pin 105. More specifically, elongated opening
176 defines a first portion 177a having a first width configured to slidably receive pivot pin 103
and a second portion 177b having a second width configured to slidably receive cam pin 105 but
sufficiently small to inhibit receipt of the larger-diameter pivot pin 103 therein.

                                                   24
[0117]        As appreciated in view of the above, handle assembly 30, slider assembly 150 of
drive assembly 1450, and trigger assembly 70 enable efficient assembly of instrument 10 in that
these components may be operably positioned within housing 20 and relative to one another via
a top-down assembly process.
[0118]        Turning now to FIGS. 22-40, the use and operation of instrument 10 is described.
Initially, as illustrated in FIGS. 22-24, 29, 31, and 33, movable handle 40 is disposed in the
initial position and, correspondingly, jaw members 110, 120 are disposed in the spaced-apart
position. More specifically, with movable handle 40 in the initial position, engagement bulge 51
is disposed in a distal-most position such that slider assembly 150 is disposed in a distal-most
position. With slider assembly 150 disposed in its distal-most position, torsion spring 160 is
less-tensioned and second leg 162 of torsion spring 160 retains drive plate 142 in a distal-most
position. Torsion spring 160 is less-tensioned but not fully un-tensioned in the initial position of
movable handle 40. This configuration maintains a pre-load on drive assembly 140 such that, as
noted above, backlash due to the complete removal of tension from torsion spring 160 as jaw
members 110, 120 move from the approximated position back to the spaced-apart position is
eliminated. Drive plate 142 is inhibited from moving proximally relative to slider assembly 150
in this position due to the abutment of the proximal edge 145 of drive plate 142 with abutment
rib 153d of proximal housing 152 of slider assembly 150. Further, in this distal-most position of
drive plate 142, drive plate 142 maintains cam pin 105 at the distal ends of cam slots 1 14b, 124b
and, thus, jaw members 110, 120 are maintained in the spaced-apart positon.
[0119]        Turning for the moment to FIG. 22A, in some embodiments, rather than first leg 161
of torsion spring 160 (FIGS. 10-11) being fixed relative to proximal housing 152 of slider
assembly 150, a torsion spring 3160 may be provided including a first leg 3161 that extends
through a slot 3153b defined within proximal housing 152 and is positioned to abut a block
3020 mounted within or monolithically formed with housing 20. As a result of this
configuration, torsion spring 3160 provides the additional function of biasing slider assembly
150 distally, thereby biasing jaw members 110, 120 towards the spaced-apart position (see FIG.
14). That is, upon movement of movable handle 40 to translate slider assembly 150 proximally
(see FIG. 9), first leg 3161 of torsion spring 3160 is maintained in position via its abutment with
block 3020, thereby further tensioning torsion spring 3160 such that, upon release of movable
handle 40 (FIG. 9), torsion spring 3160 serves to bias slider assembly 150 distally, thereby

                                                   25
biasing jaw members 110, 120 towards the spaced-apart position (see FIG. 14). Further,
multiple blocks 3020 may be provided at different positions within housing 20 such that, during
assembly, first leg 3161 of torsion spring 3160 may be positioned to abut a selected one of the
blocks 3020 to achieve a desired biasing force.
[0120]       Returning to FIGS. 22-24, 29, 31, and 33, trigger 72 is initially is disposed in the un
actuated position and, accordingly, knife blade 174 is disposed in the retracted position. More
specifically, in the un-actuated position, trigger 72 is disposed in a distal-most position under the
bias of biasing member 71 such that lower comer 77c of linkage 76, which is coupled to trigger
72 via engagement of post 75f within slot 77f, is disposed in a distal-most position. Since upper
and lower comers 77b, 77c of linkage 76 are disposed on opposite sides of apex 77a, with lower
corner 77c disposed in its distal-most position, upper corner 77b is disposed in a proximal-most
position. With upper corner 77b disposed in its proximal-most position, knife plate 172 is
likewise disposed in a proximal-most position due to the engagement of pin 78 within slot 77e.
The proximal-most position of knife plate 172 corresponds to the retracted position of knife
blade 174, wherein knife blade 174 is disposed between flanges 113a, 123a of jaw members 110,
120 but does not extend distally therefrom so as to avoid interference with tissue disposed
between jaw members 110, 120. Further, in this position, pivot pin 103 is disposed at the distal
end of first portion 177a of opening 176 of knife blade 174 and cam pin 105 is likewise disposed
within first portion 177a of opening 176.
[0121]       With additional reference to FIGS. 25-28, 30, 32, and 34, in order to move jaw
members 110, 120 to the approximated position to grasp tissue therebetween, movable handle
40 is pulled proximally towards fixed handle portion 26 from the initial position (FIG. 22) to the
compressed position (FIG. 27). Upon such movement of movable handle 40 to the compressed
position, engagement bulge 51 of movable handle 40 is moves proximally relative to housing 20,
thereby urging slider assembly 150 proximally through housing 20. Torsion spring 160, in the
less-tensioned state, is translated proximally together with slider assembly 150 such that second
leg 162 of torsion spring 160 pulls drive plate 142 proximally in connection with the proximal
translation of slider assembly 150. In other words, at this point, slider assembly 150 and drive
plate 142 move in concert with one another. As drive plate 142 is pulled proximally, cam pin
105 is pulled proximally through cam slots 1 14b, 124b such that jaw members 110, 120 are

                                                  26
pivoted from the spaced-apart position to the approximated position to grasp tissue
therebetween.
[0122]       As detailed above, movement of movable handle 40 from the initial position (FIG.
22) to the compressed position (FIG. 27) similarly translates drive plate 142 proximally, thereby
moving jaw members 110, 120 to the approximated position to grasp tissue therebetween. Drive
plate 142 is still inhibited from moving proximally relative to slider assembly 150 in this
position due to the abutment of the proximal edge 145 of drive plate 142 with abutment rib 153d
of proximal housing 152 of slider assembly 150.
[0123]       At this point, with tissue grasped between jaw members 110, 120, instrument 10
may be utilized as a pliers to maneuver, manipulate, and/or reposition tissue. In particular, as
noted above and illustrated in FIGS. 15 and 16, jaw members 110, 120 may be approximated
adjacent a wall of tissue to pinch tissue between the distal tips of jaw members 110, 120 to
enable maneuvering, manipulating, and/or repositioning thereof.
[0124]       Referring to FIG. 35, in order to apply energy to tissue grasped between jaw
members 110, 120 to treat tissue, movable handle 40 is compressed further towards fixed handle
portion 26 to an activation position, wherein an appropriate closure force or closure force within
an appropriate range, is achieved and energy activation is initiated. As movable handle 40 is
moved further proximally relative to housing 20 beyond the compressed position, an appropriate
closure force or closure force within an appropriate range is imparted to tissue grasped between
electrically-conductive plates 112, 122 of jaw members 110, 120 regardless of the thickness or
compressibility of tissue or the position of movable handle 40. This is because, upon movement
of movable handle 40 from the compressed position towards the activation position, slider
assembly 150 is translated proximally while drive plate 142 is maintained in position. In other
words, upon movement of movable handle 40 from the compressed position to the activated
position, slider assembly 150 and drive plate 142 no longer move in concert with one another.
Rather, as detailed below, slider assembly 150 and drive plate 142 are decoupled to permit
relative motion therebetween.
[0125]        The decoupling of slider assembly 150 and drive plate 142 to permit relative motion
therebetween is provided via torsion spring 160. More specifically, upon proximal movement of
movable handle 40, a first force is imparted from movable handle 40, through slider assembly

                                                   27
 150, first leg 161 of torsion spring 160, the body of torsion spring 160, and second leg 162 of
torsion spring 160, to drive plate 142 to urge drive plate 142 in a proximal direction, while a
second, opposite force acts on drive plate 142 and, thus, second leg 162 of torsion spring 160 in
a distal direction to resist further compression of tissue between jaw members 110, 120. Once
the second, opposite force exceeds the spring force of torsion spring 160, proximal movement of
slider assembly 150 no longer results in proximal movement of drive plate 142 but, rather,
results in further tensioning of torsion spring 160, which absorbs the force imparted thereto from
movement of movable handle 40. Thus, once this point as been reached, further proximal
translation of slider assembly 150 urges first end 161 of torsion spring 160 proximally, while
second opposite force retains second leg 162 of torsion spring 160 in position, thereby further
tensioning torsion spring 160. Since second leg 162 of torsion spring 160 is retained in position,
drive plate 142 is likewise retained in position despite the proximal translation of movable
handle 40 and slider assembly 150.
 [0126]       It is noted that, during movement of movable handle 40 from the initial position to
the compressed position, as detailed above, the second, opposite force is less than the spring
force of torsion spring 160 and, thus, slider assembly 150, first and second legs 161, 162 of
torsion spring 160, and drive plate 142 move in conjunction with one another. Further, torsion
spring 160 may be configured such that the second, opposite force exceeds the spring force of
torsion spring 160 at a force corresponding to a closure pressure on tissue between 3 kg/cm 2 to
 16 kg/cm 2 , as it has been found that closure forces within this range facilitate sealing of tissue
grasped between jaw members 110, 120. However, other forces and/or force ranges are also
contemplated, e.g., for treating tissue in other manners (coagulating, cauterizing, etc.).
 [0127]       Continuing with reference to FIG. 35, upon achieving the activation position of
movable handle 40, button activation post 196 (FIG. 7) of movable handle 40 contacts
depressible button 192 sufficiently so as to depress depressible button 192 into fixed handle
portion 26 to activate switch 194. Switch 194, as noted above, is disposed in electrical
communication with the generator (not shown) and electrically-conductive plates 112, 122 of
jaw members 110, 120, respectively, such that activation of switch 194 initiates the supply of
energy to electrically-conductive plates 112, 122 to treat, e.g., coagulate, cauterize, and/or seal,
tissue grasped therebetween.

                                                  28
[0128]       Referring to FIGS. 36-40, once tissue has been treated or where it is only desired to
cut tissue, knife blade 174 may be advanced between jaw members 110, 120 to cut tissue
grasped therebetween. In order to advance knife blade 174 from the retracted position to the
extended position, trigger 72 is pulled proximally against the bias of biasing member 71 from
the un-actuated position to the actuated position. As trigger 72 is pulled proximally, post 75f is
pushed proximally to urge linkage 76 to pivot counter-clockwise (from the orientation illustrated
in FIG. 36) such that upper corner 77b of linkage 76 is moved distally. Distal movement of
upper corner 77b urges pin 78 to translate distally due to the engagement of rod 79b of pin 78
within slot 77e of upper corner 77b of linkage 76. Distal translation of pin 78, in turn, urges
knife plate 172 distally due to the engagement of finger 173 of knife plate 172 within cap 79a of
pin 78.
[0129]       As detailed above, movement of trigger 72 from the un-actuated position to the
actuated position urges knife plate 172 distally. More specifically, knife plate 172 is urged
distally such that knife blade 174 is advanced distally from the retracted position to the extended
position. As knife blade 174 is advanced distally, knife blade 174 enters the knife slots of jaw
members 110, 120 defined by the respective knife slots 1 12b, 122b of electrically-conductive
plates 112, 122 and the knife slots 1 16c of the respective spacers 115 (only spacer 115 of jaw
member 110 is illustrated). As can be appreciated, translation of knife blade 174 through the
knife slots of jaw members 110, 120 to the extended position thereof divides tissue grasped
between jaw members 110, 120.
[0130]       Due to the fact that knife blade 174 defines a width greater than or equal to the
combined thickness of jaw members 110, 120 at the distal ends thereof, as knife blade 174 is
advanced distally through the knife slots, knife blade 174 may extend at least partially through
windows 119, 129 and openings 131, 132 of jaw members 110, 120, depending upon the
thickness of tissue grasped between jaw members 110, 120 (see FIG. 39). Further, as knife
blade 174 is advanced distally, pivot pin 103 and cam pin 105 translate proximally along
opening 176 eventually such that cam pin 105 extends through second portion 177b of opening
176. As pivot pin 103 is too large to extend into second portion 177b of opening 176,
interference therebetween defines the distal-most extent of travel of knife blade 174. However,
other components of knife assembly 170 and/or trigger assembly 70 may additionally or
alternatively inhibit the extension of knife blade 174.

                                                  29
[0131]        Upon release of trigger 72, trigger 72 and knife plate 172 are returned proximally
under the bias of biasing member 71 such that knife blade 174 is returned to the retracted
position. Thereafter, movable handle 40 may be returned to the initial position to release the
treated and/or divided tissue.
[0132]        The various embodiments disclosed herein may also be configured to work with
robotic surgical systems and what is commonly referred to as "Telesurgery." Such systems
employ various robotic elements to assist the surgeon and allow remote operation (or partial
remote operation) of surgical instrumentation. Various robotic arms, gears, cams, pulleys,
electric and mechanical motors, etc. may be employed for this purpose and may be designed
with a robotic surgical system to assist the surgeon during the course of an operation or
treatment. Such robotic systems may include remotely steerable systems, automatically flexible
surgical systems, remotely flexible surgical systems, remotely articulating surgical systems,
wireless surgical systems, modular or selectively configurable remotely operated surgical
systems, etc.
[0133]        The robotic surgical systems may be employed with one or more consoles that are
next to the operating theater or located in a remote location. In this instance, one team of
surgeons or nurses may prep the patient for surgery and configure the robotic surgical system
with one or more of the instruments disclosed herein while another surgeon (or group of
surgeons) remotely control the instruments via the robotic surgical system. As can be
appreciated, a highly skilled surgeon may perform multiple operations in multiple locations
without leaving his/her remote console which can be both economically advantageous and a
benefit to the patient or a series of patients.
[0134]        The robotic arms of the surgical system are typically coupled to a pair of master
handles by a controller. The handles can be moved by the surgeon to produce a corresponding
movement of the working ends of any type of surgical instrument (e.g., end effectors, graspers,
knifes, scissors, etc.) which may complement the use of one or more of the embodiments
described herein. The movement of the master handles may be scaled so that the working ends
have a corresponding movement that is different, smaller or larger, than the movement
performed by the operating hands of the surgeon. The scale factor or gearing ratio may be
adjustable so that the operator can control the resolution of the working ends of the surgical
instrument(s).

                                                   30
[0135]        The master handles may include various sensors to provide feedback to the surgeon
relating to various tissue parameters or conditions, e.g., tissue resistance due to manipulation,
cutting or otherwise treating, pressure by the instrument onto the tissue, tissue temperature,
tissue impedance, etc. As can be appreciated, such sensors provide the surgeon with enhanced
tactile feedback simulating actual operating conditions. The master handles may also include a
variety of different actuators for delicate tissue manipulation or treatment further enhancing the
surgeon's ability to mimic actual operating conditions.
[0136]         From the foregoing and with reference to the various figure drawings, those skilled
in the art will appreciate that certain modifications can also be made to the present disclosure
without departing from the scope of the same. While several embodiments of the disclosure
have been shown in the drawings, it is not intended that the disclosure be limited thereto, as it is
