Abstract
Disclosed is a technology for collecting transaction information for interactive payment
experience. According to one embodiment, a payment service system receives
transaction information from a card payment network. Using the received transaction
information, the payment service system can determine a digital transaction receipt
that is designed to interact with the consumer. A mobile device of the consumer
receives and presents the digital transaction receipt. The interactive interface of the
digital transaction receipt enables the consumer to interact with the receipt in various
ways, such as specifying tip amount, entering feedback, confirming the transaction
etc.

15 BACKGROUND
   [0004]         The traditional manner of providing receipts for payment transactions
   using financial accounts (e.g., credit cards and debit cards) is to print the payment
   amount and the purchased goods or services on a paper receipt. For instance, when
   a consumer wishes to pay for an item at a merchant's place of business by using a
20 credit card, the consumer typically runs the credit card through a card reader at the
   merchant's point-of-sale (POS) terminal. The merchant's POS terminal submits a
   transaction request to an acquirer. The merchant typically stores all of the day's
   authorized transactions in a batch, and sends the batch to the acquirer at the end of
   the day to receive payment. The acquirer sends the batch to a card network (e.g.,
25 VISA or MasterCard), which distributes the transactions to credit card issuers. The
   credit card issuers authorize the transactions and then transfer the transaction
   amounts to one or more financial accounts of the merchant.
   [0005]         After a transaction has been authorized, the credit card issuer sends a
   confirmation to the POS terminal along a path opposite to that described above. The
30 POS terminal prints out a paper receipt listing the purchases made, the method of
   payment, and the prices including tax, discounts and other price adjustments. The
   paper receipt serves as a proof of the purchase for the consumer.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0017]         References in this description to "an embodiment", "one embodiment",
   or the like, mean that the particular feature, function, structure or characteristic being
   described is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention.
 5 Occurrences of such phrases in this specification do not necessarily all refer to the
   same embodiment. On the other hand, the embodiments referred to also are not
   necessarily mutually exclusive.
   [0018]         Introduced here is technology that enables consumers to interact with
   digital transaction receipts (also referred to as interactive digital receipts) received by
10 their mobile devices. According to one embodiment, a payment service system
   receives transaction information from a card payment network. Using the received
   transaction information, the payment service system generates a digital transaction
   receipt that is designed to interact with the consumer. A mobile device of the
   consumer receives the digital transaction receipt via a wireless network and displays it
15 to the consumer. The consumer can interact with the digital transaction receipt in any
   of various ways, such as specifying tip amount, entering feedback, confirming the
   transaction, etc.
   [0019]         In some embodiments, the payment service system can receive
   transaction information from different entities involved in processing the payment
20 transaction. For example, the payment service system may receive transaction
   information from the merchant, the acquirer or the issuer. In order to identify the
   financial accounts that require transaction information collection, the entity supplying
   the transaction information (e.g., a card payment network) can maintain a database
   including information of financial accounts having a particular classification (e.g.,
25 accounts that are known to be associated with the payment service system). When
   the entity determines that a requested financial transaction relates to a financial
   account so classified in the database, the entity transmits the transaction information
   to the payment service system in real-time or near real-time, so that the payment
   service system can generate an interactive digital transaction receipt for the
30 consumer.
   [0020]         The payment service system can receive messages indicative that a
   consumer chooses to enroll his or her financial accounts for the interactive payment
   service. Accordingly the payment service system can send instructions to an entity

    WO 2015/179316                                                     PCT/US2015/031423
                                              4
   supplying transaction information (e.g., the card payment network) to adjust the
   database which identifies financial accounts.
   [0021]         In some embodiments, a merchant server can maintain a database
   including the information of financial accounts having a particular classification. The
 5 classification indicates that these financial accounts are associated with the payment
   service system. When the merchant server determines a requested financial
   transaction involves a financial account classified in the database, the merchant
   server transmits the item-level transaction information to the payment service system.
   The payment service system receives the item-level transaction information in
10 real-time or near real-time and generates an interactive digital transaction receipt for
   the consumer.
   [0022]         FIG. 1 illustrates an environment in which the interactive payment
   experience technique introduced here can be implemented. The environment
   includes a merchant POS system of a merchant 100 and a mobile device 102 of a
15 user 101 (also referred to as "customer" or "consumer"). The mobile device 102 can
   be, for example, a smart phone, tablet computer, notebook computer, or any other
   form of mobile processing device. A mobile payment application 120 runs on the
   user's mobile device 102. The environment also includes a computer system 114 of
   the merchant's acquirer, a computer system 118 of an issuing bank, a computer
20 system 116 of a card payment network, and a computer system 108 of a payment
   service (hereinafter "payment service system 108"). The payment service system can
   be operated by an interactive payment experience service provider. The merchant's
   acquirer is a bank or financial institution that processes payments (e.g., credit or debit
   card payments) on behalf of a merchant. The acquirer acquires the payments from an
25 issuer. The issuer (or issuing bank) is a bank or financial institution that offered a
   financial account (e.g., credit or debit card account) to the user 101. The issuer issues
   payments to the acquirer on behalf of the user 101 (consumer).
   [0023]         Each of the aforementioned computer systems can include one or more
   distinct physical computers and/or other processing devices which, in the case of
30 multiple devices, can be connected to each other through one or more wired and/or
   wireless networks. All of the aforementioned devices are coupled to each other
   through an internetwork 106, which can be or include the Internet and one or more
   wireless networks (e.g., a WiFi network and or a cellular telecommunications
   network).

    WO 2015/179316                                                     PCT/US2015/031423

   [0024]         The environment illustrated in FIG. I can accommodate both traditional
   payment card transactions (i.e., those involving reading of physical card of the
   customer at the merchant's location), as well as card-not-present (CNP) transactions
   (i.e., those where the card is not physically presented at the time that the payment is
 5 effected). In a traditional credit card transaction, for example, the merchant swipes
   the user's credit card through a card reader at the POS system 104. The term "swipe"
   here refers to any manner of triggering a card reader to read data from a card, such as
   by passing a card into or through a magnetic stripe card reader, optical scanner,
   smartcard (card with an embedded IC chip) reader (e.g., an EMV-compliant card
10 reader ), radio frequency identification (RFID) reader, or the like. The POS system
   104 sends data read from the card (e.g., the cardholders name, credit card number,
   expiration date and card verification value (CVV)) to the computer system 114 of the
   merchant's acquirer (hereinafter "acquirer 114"). The acquirer 114 sends this data to
   the computer system 116 of the card payment network (e.g., Visa or MasterCard)
15 (hereinafter "card payment network 116"), which forwards the data to the computer
   system 118 of the issuing bank (hereinafter "issuer 118"). If the transaction is
   approved by the issuer 118, a payment authorization message is sent from the issuer
   118 to the merchant POS system 104 via a path opposite of that described above.
   [0025]         In a card-not-present transaction, for example, the consumer places an
20 online order by transmitting the data of a credit card from the mobile device 102 to the
   POS system 104. The POS system 104 can include, e.g., a web server for receiving
   the online order information. Then the POS system 104 sends the data of the card to
   the acquirer 114. The acquirer 114, the issuer 118 and the card payment network 116
   complete the transaction in a way similar to the traditional credit card transaction.
25 [0026]         The payment service system 108 includes one or more server
   computers programmed to collect transaction information, and to provide interactive
   user interface based on the collected information. The payment service system 108
   can collect the transaction information from various parties, such as the POS system
   104, the acquirer 114, the issuer 118 and the card payment network 116.
30 [0027]         FIG. 2 illustrates an environment in which a payment service system
   collects transaction information from a card payment network. The user 101 can
   enroll his financial accounts for an interactive payment service through a mobile
   application running on the mobile device 102. Alternatively, the user 101 can enroll
   through a website. The user 101 may need to enter additional information for account

    WO 2015/179316                                                     PCT/US2015/031423

   verification purpose, such as card verification value (CVV), registration address, or
   even a picture of the payment card.
   [0028]          The mobile device 102 in turn notifies the payment service system 108
   about the enrollment. The enrollment message authorizes the payment service
 5 system 108 to collect transaction information regarding the payment transactions that
   relate to the enrolled financial accounts.
   [0029]          The payment service system 108 can include a database for storing the
   information of the signed-up financial accounts including, e.g., data identifying the
   signed-up financial accounts, owners of the accounts, etc. The payment service
10 system 108 sends an instruction to the card payment network 116 to cause the card
   payment network 116 to include the information of the signed-up financial account in a
   whitelist database. The card payment network 116 (or another entity involved in
   processing of payment transactions) subsequently uses the whitelist database during
   processing of a particular payment transaction to determine whether to send
15 transaction information of the particular payment transaction to the payment service
   system 108.
   [0030]          The user 101 initiates a payment transaction process by swiping a
   payment card through a card reader of the POS system 104 (as a traditional payment
   card transaction) or sending data of a financial account to the POS system 104 (as a
20 card-not-present transaction). For example, the user 101 can use the mobile device
   102 to place an online order by instructing the mobile device 102 to send the data of
   the financial account to the POS system 104. The POS system 104 receives the order
   and determines various information such as the total amount and stock availability.
   Then the POS system 104 generates a request for a payment transaction and sends
25 the request and data of the financial account to the acquirer 114. The data of the
   financial account can include, e.g., cardholder's name, card number, expiration date
   and card verification value (CVV).
   [0031]          The acquirer 114 send the payment authorization request and data of
   the financial account to the card payment network 116. Based on the received data of
30 the financial account, the card payment network 116 determines the financial
   institution (issuer) that issued the financial account and distributes the payment
   authorization request and data of the financial account to the issuer 118. Once the
   issuer 118 approves the payment transaction on behalf of the user 101, the issuer 118

    WO 2015/179316                                                     PCT/US2015/031423
                                             7
   sends a payment authorization message to the POS system 104 via a path opposite
   of that described above.
   [0032]         When the card payment network 116 receives the request for the
   payment transaction, the card payment network 116 immediately determines whether
 5 the corresponding financial account is identified in the whitelist database that the card
   payment network 116 maintains (or to which the payment network 116 has access). If
   the whitelist database includes that financial account, the card payment network 116
   then immediately sends the transaction information to the payment service system
   108. Hence, the card payment network 116 makes this determination and, if
10 appropriate, sends this information to the payment service system 108, during the
   transaction authorization process.
   [0033]         The payment service system 108 can communicate with the card
   payment network 116 through, e.g., a predetermined application programming
   interface (API). Through the API, the payment service system 108 receives the
15 transaction information that relates to financial accounts that have been enrolled for
   the interactive payment service. The transaction information of a transaction can
   include, e.g., an amount of the payment transaction, an identification of the associated
   financial account, an identity of the merchant, and item-level information. The
   item-level information relates to the goods or services involved in the payment
20 transaction. The item-level information can include names, identification numbers,
   prices, or descriptions of the goods or services. For example, item-level information of
   a purchase in a coffeehouse can include information such as iced coffee and apple
   pie (i.e., names), SKU102 and SKU 231 (i.e., stock-keeping unit numbers), $2.99 and
   $3.49 (i.e., prices).
25 [0034]         The payment service system 108 may receive transaction information
   from systems other than the card payment network 116. For example the acquirer
   114 or the issuer 118 can also maintain a whitelist database for financial accounts that
   have been enrolled for the interactive payment service. Similar to the card payment
   network 116 as illustrated in FIG. 2, the acquirer 114 or the issuer 118 can update the
30 whitelist database when the payment service system 108 sends an instruction to add
   a new financial account into the database. When the acquirer 114 or the issuer 118
   receives a request for processing a payment transaction that relates to a financial
   account identified by the whitelist database, the acquirer 114 or the issuer 118 sends
   the transaction information to the payment service system 108.

    WO 2015/179316                                                     PCT/US2015/031423

   [0035]         In some alternative embodiments, instead of maintaining a whitelist
   database for identifying financial accounts for the purpose of transaction information
   collection, the payment card used by the user 101 can include additional data for
   transaction information collection purpose. Once the payment card swipes through a
 5 card reader of the POS system 104, the POS system 104 sends the additional data
   along with the data of the payment card to the acquirer 114. The acquirer 114, the
   card payment network 116 or the issuer 118 can follow the instruction included in the
   additional data to send the transaction information relating to the payment card to the
   payment service system 108.
10 [0036]         Instead of receiving transaction information from the acquirer 114, card
   payment network 116 and the issuer 118, the payment service system can receive
   transaction information from the POS system 104. FIG. 3 illustrates an environment in
   which a payment service system collects transaction information from a point-of-sale
   (POS) system. The POS system 104 maintains a whitelist database for financial
15 accounts that have been enrolled for the interactive payment service.
   [0037]         The POS system 104 can add to or drop from the whitelist database any
   financial account, based on the instructions received from the payment service system
   108. A user 101 can use the mobile device 102 to send messages to the payment
   service system 108, indicating that the user 101 wants to enroll a financial account for
20 the interactive payment service (or disassociate the financial account with the
   interactive payment service).
   [0038]         Once the user 101 swipes a payment card through a card reader of the
   POS system 104, or sends data of a financial account to the POS system 104 (e.g.,
   via the mobile device 102), the POS system 140 determines the total amount and
25 generates a request for processing the payment transaction. The POS system sends
   the request to the acquirer 114. The acquirer 114 further sends the request to the card
   payment network 116, which identifies the issuer 118 based on the data of the
   financial account. Once the issuer 118 approves the payment transaction, the issuer
   118 sends a payment authorization message to the POS system 104 via a path
30 opposite of that described above.
   [0039]         The POS system 104 scans the whitelist database to determine whether
   the financial account is identified by the whitelist database. If the financial account is
   identified by the whitelist database, the POS system 104 sends the transaction
   information to the payment service system 108. The transaction information includes

    WO 2015/179316                                                     PCT/US2015/031423
                                              9
   item-level information describing or identifying the goods or services involved in the
   payment transaction. As an incentive for the POS system 104 of the merchant 100 to
   supply the transaction information, the merchant 100 may receive a fee discount for
   processing the payment transaction. In some embodiments, the payment service
 5 system 108 can directly confirm the receipt of the transaction information with the card
   payment network 116 so that the merchant 100 will receive the processing fee
   discount. Alternatively, the payment service system 108 can send a proof of receiving
   the transaction information, such as a confirmation code. The POS system 104
   forwards the confirmation code to the card payment network 116 to receive the
10 processing fee discount.
   [0040]          The payment service system can establish a communication channel
   with the POS system 104 through an application programming interview (API). Using
   the communication channel, the payment service system 108 can further monitor the
   status of the selected payment transaction in real time. The POS system 104 can
15 grant the payment service system 108 access to any payment transaction relating to
   financial accounts identified by the whitelist database. Thus, the payment service
   system 108 not only can receive the transaction information, but also can monitor the
   status of the payment transaction, including being notified of the payment completion
   in real time.
20 [0041]          Using the received transaction information, the payment service system
   108 can provide the interactive payment service to the user 101 in various ways. For
   example, the payment service system 108 can generate an interactive digital receipt
   based on the transaction information and send the interactive digital receipt to the
   mobile device 102 of the user 101. The mobile device 102 can present the interactive
25 digital receipt in different forms, such as a cell phone message, an email, a webpage,
   a push notification, or a user interface within the mobile payment application 120. The
   user 101 can interact with the interactive digital receipt for performing various tasks,
   such as confirming the total amount, adjusting tip amount, entering feedback, applying
   promotional discount, etc.
30 [0042]          The connections between the systems and/or devices in FIGs. 2 and 3
   can be either direct or indirect. For example, the connection between the payment

   [0043]         FIG. 4A illustrates a first embodiment of an interactive digital receipt
   implemented on a mobile device 400A. A mobile device can be a smartphone (e.g.,
   iPhone®, Android®-enabled phone, etc.), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet,
   an e-reader, or other mobile or portable computing devices, a desktop, a laptop, or
 5 other wired and wireless personal computers. In the embodiment of FIG. 4A, mobile
   device 400A is a tablet computer. Mobile device 400A is equipped with a display
   screen 402 for displaying various user interfaces to enable a user (e.g., customer) to
   interact with content generated on the mobile device 400A.
   [0044]         Mobile device 400A can implement an application, such as an
10 interactive receipt mobile application for use by a mobile user, where the interactive
   receipt mobile application includes one or more customer interface components of
   interactive digital receipt 404. The interactive receipt mobile application can be either
   the same application as mobile payment application 120 or an application separate
   from the mobile payment application 120. As used herein, the term "customer
15 interactive component" refers to a component of a user interface intended for a
   customer to view and interact (e.g., submit inputs) with various features offered via
   interactive digital receipt 404. Interactive digital receipt 404 includes information
   indicative of the payment transaction, such as transaction information (e.g., payment
   amount and item description), and various features that allow the customer to perform
20 action associated with the transaction, subsequent to delivery of the receipt to the
   customer. While interactive digital receipt 404 is embodied in a mobile application
   according to the embodiment of FIGS. 4A-4B, other embodiments of the receipt are
   possible in light of the disclosure herein. In some embodiments, interactive digital
   receipt 404 is embodied in a text message that can be received at a computing device
25 (e.g., devices 400A, 400B). In some embodiment, interactive digital receipt 404 is
   embodied in an email message that can be received at the computing device.
   [0045]         In some embodiments, payment service system 108 generates
   interactive digital receipt 404 for a customer after completion of a payment transaction
   between the customer and a merchant (e.g., payment authorization and approval that
30 occurs at the completion of a service and/or tendering of goods). Payment service
   system 108 then delivers receipt 404 to the customer at the customer's mobile device
   400A. In some embodiments, the payment service system 108 includes a digital
   receipt system that carries out the functionalities associated with implementing receipt
   404.

    WO 2015/179316                                                      PCT/US2015/031423

   [0046]          The mobile device 400A receives and displays the interactive digital
   receipt 404 on display screen 402. Interactive digital receipt 404 may take up an
   entirety or any portion of display screen 402. Interactive digital receipt 404 can include
   various contents offered to the customer. In the embodiment of FIG. 4A, interactive
 5 digital receipt 404 includes a transaction component 406 and one or more interactive
   components 408, 410, 412. The transaction component 406 displays details
   associated with a particular transaction between the customer and the merchant,
   where the transaction details are displayed in real time in response to an occurrence
   of the particular transaction (e.g., payment transaction at the completion of a service).
10 The interactive components 408, 410, 412 display one or more features for the
   customer to interact or perform an action associated with the transaction. In some
   embodiments, the features are generated so as to be available via the interactive
   digital receipt 404 only within a predefined time period. The predefined time period is
   configurable by the merchant and allows the merchant to provide time-based
15 incentives to engage the customer.
   [0047]          The interactive components and general look and feel of interactive
   digital receipt 404 can be configured according to a particular merchant's needs. For
   example, a merchant in the business of selling household supplies can configure the
   interactive digital receipt to generate a feedback component without generating a
20 tipping component. In another example, a merchant in the business of operating a
   restaurant can choose to have both the tipping and the feedback components be
   generated in the interactive digital receipt 404. One of ordinary skill in the art will
   appreciate that other configurations and components are possible.
   [0048]          FIG. 4B illustrates a second embodiment of an interactive digital receipt
25 implemented on a mobile device 400B. According to the embodiment of FIG. 4B, the
   mobile device 400B is a smartphone. In FIG. 4B, interactive digital receipt 404
   includes transaction components 406A, 406B, an interactive tipping component 420,
   an interactive feedback component 430, an interactive promotion component 440, an
   interactive loyalty rewards component 450, an interactive transaction records
30 component 460, and an interactive financial accounts component 470.
   [0049]          Transaction components 406A, 406B provide transaction information
   associated with the transaction. Transaction component 406A includes an overview
   of the transaction completed between the customer and the merchant, such as the
   total amount of the transaction, the payment card used for the transaction (e.g.,

    WO 2015/179316                                                      PCT/US2015/031423
                                               12
   payment card name or last four digits of a payment card associated with the payment
   card), and the date, among others. Transaction component 406B includes details of
   the transaction, such as the name of the items purchased, the quantity, and the price,
   among others. For example, the transaction component 406B includes item-level
 5 information such as turkey sandwich and iced team (i.e., item names), $8.70 and
   $2.75 (item prices).
   [0050]         Interactive tipping component 420 (or, "tipping component") allows the
   customer to submit a gratuity ("tip") amount at a later time, i.e., subsequent to
   completion of a payment transaction. An example transaction, for example, is
10 payment for a meal, where the customer can leave a tip after she has left the
   restaurant using interactive digital receipt 404 on her mobile device 400B, which has
   been delivered to device 400B automatically after completion of payment. In some
   embodiments, payment service system 108 receives the customer's tip submission
   via interactive receipt 404 and communicates the amount to the card payment network
15 116. The card payment network 116 adds the tip amount to the already authorized
   payment amount and sends the updated authorization to POS system 104 of the
   merchant, without requiring any additional payment approval from the customer. The
   merchant does not have to physically enter and request for an additional authorization
   for the tip amount from the card payment network 116.
20 [0051]         In some embodiment, tipping component 420 includes automatically
   generated tip amounts based on a payment amount associated with the transaction
   (e.g., 10%, 15%, or 20%). In some embodiments, tipping component 420 includes a
   text box that allows the customer to enter a number. In some embodiments, where
   interactive digital receipt 404 is in the form of a text message, tipping component 420
25 is embodied in a text message prompting the customer to reply with an amount (e.g.,
   "Tip by reply with dollar amount"). In some embodiments, tipping component 420 is a
   Uniform Resource Locator (URL) link which takes the user to a web page to allow
   adding of the tip amount. The link can be a part of a text message, a part of the text
   box within a mobile app, or an email.
30 [0052]         In some embodiments, tipping component 420 is configured to be
   available for an unlimited time period. In some embodiments, tipping component 420
   is configured to be available for a predefined time period, or timeframe, starting after a
   time instance when payment has been authorized and approved. The time period
   may be, for example, an hour, a day, a week, or any other desired time period (e.g.,

    WO 2015/179316                                                      PCT/US2015/031423
                                               13
   unlimited). In some embodiments, the time period is configured by the merchant. The
   time period is initialized, or started, at a time instance at which the transaction
   between the customer and merchant has completed, and decreases incrementally,
   from this time instance, at a rate that corresponds to an ordinary passage of time. At
 5 the expiration of the time period (i.e., the countdown reaches 0), the tipping feature
   becomes unavailable. In a real-world setting, such time limitation helps the merchant
   manage its payment transactions more efficiently. For example, a merchant often
   processes its payment transactions in batches and would not want to keep any
   particular transaction open indefinitely.
10 [0053]         In some embodiments, the time period of the tipping component 420 is
   configured to incorporate a user defined default tip amount. A customer defines a
   nominal tip to be automatically submitted if no tip is submitted at the time period
   expiration. For example, customer defines the default tip to be $10 for her favorite
   restaurant to make sure that merchant always gets a tip. In such example, the $10 tip
15 is automatically authorized for any transaction with that restaurant whenever no tip
   amount is added at the expiration. In some embodiments, the default tip amount may
   be defined by the merchant. For example, a restaurant merchant may want to
   configure a default nominal amount for restaurant services to groups of six parties or
   more. In such example, when no tip is added to the payment amount at the end of a
20 time period (e.g., 2 hours), an automatic 20% tip is added to the customer's payment
   card authorization.
   [0054]         Interactive feedback component 430 (or, "feedback component") allows
   the customer to submit feedback after the completion of a particular transaction with a
   merchant. The feedback may include submitting, for example, a rating (e.g., 5 stars),
25 a review, a suggestion, or the like, on various aspects of the transaction (e.g., store
   cleanliness, service, products, overall visit satisfaction, etc.). In some embodiments,
   the feedback is submitted directly to the merchant. In some embodiments, a digital
   receipt system, coupled to transaction computer system, coordinates, communicates,
   and links with third party services associated with the merchant in implementing the
30 feedback feature. In such embodiments, the digital receipt system transmits the
   feedback, submitted by the customer via receipt 404, to the third party services. The
   third party services aggregate the feedback in association with other feedback
   provided by the merchant. Such third party services may include, for example,
   Yelp.com, Urban Spoon, YP.com, and the like.

    WO 2015/179316                                                  PCT/US2015/031423
                                            14
   [0055]         In some embodiments, feedback component 430 is configured to be
   available only for a predefined time period, or timeframe. In some embodiments, the
   time period associated with the feedback component 430 ("feedback time period") is
   configured to be the same as the time period associated with tipping component 420
 5 ("tipping time period"). For example, the time periods for both may be set at one hour
   and at the expiration of the hour, both the tipping and the feedback features become
   unavailable. In some embodiments, the feedback time period is configured to be
   different from the tipping time period. For example, the feedback time period may be
   set at one week while the tipping time period may be set at one hour.
10 [0056]         In some embodiments, the feedback time period is configured differently
   depending on a particular merchant. For example, merchant A configures the
   feedback time period to be one day while merchant B configures the time period to be
   one week. In such example, feedback component becomes unavailable to the
   customer only on the receipt generated for merchant A, and the feedback component
15 on the receipt generated for merchant B remains active until the end of the week.    In
   some embodiments, a merchant can configure the feedback time period to be tied to
   an incentive (i.e., "feedback reward") to encourage feedback. For example, the
   customer is rewarded a "20% Off Coupon" incentive, or feedback reward, if a written
   review is submitted before expiration of the feedback time period. In another
20 example, if the feedback is submitted within 10 minutes after the completion of the
   payment transaction, the reward is a 20% Off coupon; on the other hand, if the
   feedback is submitted within 12 hours, but not exceeding the transaction time period
   allowed for the feedback (e.g., 24 hours), the reward is a 5% coupon.
   [0057]         Interactive promotion component 440 (or, "promotion component")
25 allows a particular merchant to engage and incentivize a customer to interact with the
   merchant. In some embodiments, promotion component generates one or more
   promotional rewards (or, "promotion") associated with the completed transaction. For
   example, merchant A provides a coupon that can be redeemed at merchant B, an
   affiliated business with merchant A. In some embodiments, the promotion is
30 time-based, where the customer must redeem the reward within a predefined period,
   or timeframe. In such embodiments, the promotion is configured to reduce, or
   decrease in value, corresponding to a decrease in the passage of time associated with
   the time period. The time period associated with the promotion component 440

    WO 2015/179316                                                   PCT/US2015/031423
                                             15
   ("promotion time period") may be configured to be the same as, or different from, the
   feedback time period, and/or the tipping time period.
   [0058]          In one example, a "$10 off" coupon is generated via the interactive
   digital receipt for the customer to redeem at a next meal with the merchant. Such $10
 5 coupon is set to decrease in value (i.e., until $0) from the moment the coupon is
   generated subsequent to the transaction at the merchant's store. As such, the sooner
   the customer redeems the time-based coupon, the higher the value she receives. In
   some embodiments, the merchant configures the rate of reduction. In one example,
   the restaurant sets the $10 coupon to expire after a week, with no reduction in value
10 as long as the coupon is redeemed. In another example, the restaurant sets the $10
   coupon to expire after 3 days, where the value reduces each day until the value
   reaches $0 at the end of the third day.
   [0059]          In some embodiments, the customer redeems the promotion by
   completing various redemption, or promotional, activities. Details of the activities may
15 be displayed in the promotion component 440. Some redemption activities include
   simply revisiting the merchant to make another purchase for goods and/or services, as
   discussed in the example above. Other redemption activities include participating in a
   game via the mobile device 400B. Some redemption activities include participating in
   activities with other affiliated merchants. The redemption activity and the decreasing
20 rate of the time-based reward may be configured by the merchant offering the reward.
   Such configurations are beneficial as they allow the merchant to customize the
   promotions according to the merchant's business, such as tailoring to an advertising
   campaign or a targeted customer demographic.
   [0060]          In some embodiments, promotion component 440 operates as an
25 advertisement component to promote products and/or services. Such advertisement
   includes, for example, a promotional reward to entice the user to "click-on" or select a
   particular offering being displayed. In another example, the advertisement includes a
   plain display with no interaction required from the customer, where the interaction
   comes from the advertisement content changing to attract the customer's attention.
30 The advertisement content can change based on the completed transaction for which
   the receipt 404 has been generated. For example, for a coffee purchase transaction,
   the advertisement includes information about a sustainable coffee alliance
   organization. The advertisement can also include information about nearby
   merchants associated with the venue where the completed transaction has taken

    WO 2015/179316                                                     PCT/US2015/031423
                                              16
   place. In some embodiments, the interactive advertisement component is coupled to
   the interactive transaction record, where advertisement content is changed based on
   details extracted from the interactive transaction record.
   [0061]          Interactive loyalty rewards component 450 (or, "loyalty record
 5 component") allows the customer to maintain and manage loyalty points associated
   with a particular merchant. Some merchants, for example, choose to reward loyal
   customers with reward points for their purchases and/or services transacted with the
   merchant. Loyalty record component 450 tracks those purchases and/or services
   over time, stores and updates reward points associated with the purchases and/or
10 services, and maintains a membership status of the customer in relation to a particular
   merchant. In some embodiments, the loyalty record component is configured to be
   time-based, where the component tracks and maintains the loyalty status and/or
   rewards based on a predefined time period. For example, the loyalty record
   component upgrades the loyalty status of the consumer every month, where it
15 calculates the transactions completed by the consumer within the month. The time
   period associated with the loyalty record component 450 ("loyalty time period") may be
   configured to be the same as, or different from, time periods associated with other
   interactive components of the interactive receipt.
   [0062]          In an illustrative example, the rewards record tracks the number of
20 baked goods bought from merchant A's bakery and updates the customer to an "elite
   status" in relation to that bakery when the customer has bought 10 items within 5 days.
   The elite status is displayed in the loyalty record component 450. The customer can
   redeem for a reward at the bakery with the loyalty record. In some embodiments, the
   merchant's POS system can communicate with the loyalty record component 450
25 without need for the customer to physically show the loyalty record at time of
   redemption.
   [0063]          Interactive transaction records component 460 ("transaction records
   component"). Transaction records component 460 includes one or more interactive
   digital receipts that has resulted from one or more payment transactions carried out by
30 the customer with one or more merchants. In some embodiments, transaction
   records component 460 is configured to include only interactive digital receipts
   associated with a particular merchant. In some embodiments, transaction records
   component 460 is configured to include all interactive digital receipts associated with
   the customer, including receipts associated with different merchants with whom the

    WO 2015/179316                                                    PCT/US2015/031423
                                             17
   customer has transacted. The interactive transaction record allows the customer to
   organize her interactive digital receipts, to maintain a comprehensive view of all
   payment transactions, and to perform one or more actions associated with those
   transactions via respective interactive components of the receipts. Other interactive
 5 components not discussed above, but consistent with the techniques discussed
   throughout, may also be envisioned by one of ordinary skill in the art based on the
   disclosed technology.
   [0064]        Interactive financial accounts component 470 (or, "financial accounts
   component") allows the customer to maintain and change financial accounts, or
10 financial accounts, associated with a particular payment transaction in which a
   payment object (e.g., payment card) is utilized. The financial accounts component
   allows a customer to review details about the transaction, including the financial
   accounts that are associated with the consumer's payment object and the particular
   financial account selected for payment in a particular transaction. In some
15 embodiments, the financial accounts component allows the consumer to change the
   selected financial account to another financial account associated with the payment
   object. For example, the consumer, after leaving the merchant's place of business,
   remembers she has unused credits in a gift card, and accesses the financial accounts
   component to select the gift card, instead of a VISA credit card, to pay for the
20 transaction. In some embodiments, the financial accounts component 470 is
   configured to be time-based, where the component enables the consumer to change
   financial accounts within a predefined time period. For example, the consumer is able
   to change the selected financial accounts only within one hour after the transaction
   has been completed (e.g., after authorization and approval). In another example, the
25 consumer is able to change the selected financial accounts within 24 hours after the
   transaction.
   [0065]        FIG. 5A illustrates an example of a process of classifying financial
   accounts for transaction information collection. Initially, a consumer uses a mobile
   device 102 to choose signing up a financial account of the consumer for an interactive
30 payment service (step 505). The mobile device 102 sends a message to a payment
   service system 108 indicative of the consumer's choice (step 510).
   [0066]        Upon receiving the message (step 515), the payment service system
   108 sends to a card payment network system 116 a classification instruction (step
   520). Upon receiving the classification instruction (step 525), the card payment

    WO 2015/179316                                                       PCT/US2015/031423
                                               18
   network system 116 applies a predetermined classification to the financial account of
   the consumer (step 530), i.e., a classification indicative that the account is associated
   with the payment service system 108. The classification may, but does not
   necessarily, indicate to the card payment network system 116 that the financial
 5 account has been enrolled for the interactive payment service. The classification
   allows the card payment network system 116 to identify the financial accounts
   associated with the payment service system 108 so that the card payment network
   system 116 sends transaction information relating to these financial accounts to the
   payment service system 108. The card payment network system 116 can, e.g.,
10 maintain a database storing information identifying the financial accounts associated
   with the payment service system 108.
   [0067]          FIG. 5B illustrates an example of a process of collecting transaction
   information by a payment service system. Initially, a consumer instructs his or her
   mobile device 102 to place an online order (step 535), using, for example, a mobile
15 browser or mobile payment application. Upon receiving the online order from the
   mobile device 102 (step 540), a merchant server 104 (e.g., the POS system 104
   illustrated in FIG. 1) initiates a payment transaction for the online order (step 545). In
   some alternative embodiments, the merchant server 104 initiates the payment
   transaction when a payment card swipes through a card reader connected to
20 merchant server 104 or included in the merchant server 104.
   [0068]          The merchant server 104 sends to the card payment network system
   116 a payment authorization request for the payment transaction (step 550). Upon
   receiving the payment authorization request (step 555), the card payment network
   system 116 determines whether the financial account associated with the payment
25 transaction has been applied with the predetermined classification (step 560). The
   card payment network system 116 can maintain a database including information of
   financial accounts that have been applied with the predetermined classification and
   use the database to determine whether a particular financial account is classified or
   not.
30 [0069]          If that financial account is classified, the card payment network system
   116 sends transaction information of the payment transaction to the payment service
   system 108, through an application programming interface (API) (step 565). If that
   financial account is not classified, the card payment network system 116 does not
   send the transaction information to the payment service system 108 (step 567).

   communicate with mobile device 102. The payment service system 108 receives the
   transaction information from the card payment network system 116 (step 570). Based
 5 on the transaction information, the payment service system 108 generates a digital
   transaction receipt indicative of the payment transaction (step 575). The payment
   service system 108 then transmits to the mobile device 102 of the consumer an
   instruction for a mobile application in the mobile device 102 to display (or output in any
   other manner) the digital transaction receipt to the consumer (step 580). The payment
10 service system 108 is not a participant in processing the payment transaction and is
   not in a payment transaction message flow between the merchant's POS system 104
   and a card issuer or card payment network system 116 involved in the transaction.
   [0071]         The mobile device 102 displays (or otherwise outputs) the digital
   transaction receipt that lists item-level information relating to goods or services
15 involved in the payment transaction and includes an interface element to enable the
   consumer to specify a gratuity amount of the payment transaction (step 585). Next,
   the mobile device 102 inputs the gratuity amount specified by the consumer through
   the interface element (step 590). The mobile device 102 sends a message indicative
   of the gratuity amount to the payment service system 108 (step 592).
20 [0072]          Upon receiving the message indicative of the gratuity amount (step
   595), the payment service system 108 sends to the card payment network system 116
   a request to adjust the total payment amount of the payment transaction based on the
   gratuity amount that has been specified by the consumer (step 597). Accordingly, the
   card payment network system 116 adjusts the total amount of the payment
25 transaction based on the gratuity amount (step 598). In some alternative
   embodiments, a consumer or a merchant can specify a gratuity amount using the
   POS system 104. Likewise the POS system 104 can present a digital receipt and a
   user interface for specifying the gratuity amount. Upon receiving the specified gratuity
   amount, the POS system 104 sends the amount to the payment server system 108 to
30 adjust the total payment transaction amount.
   [0073]          In some embodiments, the digital transaction receipt presented by the
   mobile device 102 includes a user interface element to enable the consumer to
   specify a promotional code. The payment service system 108 sends a request to the
   card payment network to confirm the validity of the promotional code and to adjust the

    WO 2015/179316                                                    PCT/US2015/031423
                                             20
   amount of the payment transaction based on a promotion associated with the
   promotional code if the promotional code is valid.
   [0074]         In some other embodiments, the digital transaction receipt presented by
   the mobile device 102 includes an interface element to enable the consumer to
 5 specify a comment that relates to a purchase or a merchant associated with the
   payment transaction. The digital transaction receipt can further include a link to a
   website or a mobile application for managing the financial account.
   [0075]         The mobile device 102 can further send the payment service system
   108 the location information regarding the geographical location of the mobile device
10 102 when the mobile device 102 communicates with the POS system and initiates the
   payment transaction. The payment service system 108 can then forward the location
   information to the card payment network system 116. Both the payment service
   system 108 and the card payment network system 116 can utilize the location
   information to analyze the behavior pattern of the consumer.
15 [0076]         In some alternative embodiments, the payment service system 108
   receives the transaction information from another payment processing entity involved
   in the transaction (e.g., an issuer 118, an acquirer 114 or a merchant server), instead
   of the card payment network system 116. For example the acquirer 114 or the issuer
   118 can also maintain a whitelist database for financial accounts that have been
20 applied with a predetermined classification. When the acquirer 114 or the issuer 118
   determines that a financial account associated a received payment authorization
   request has been applied with the predetermined classification, the acquirer 114 or
   the issuer 118 sends the transaction information to the payment service system 108.
   The payment processing entity may provide a processing fee discount as an incentive
25 for the merchant server 104 to supply the transaction information.
   [0077]         FIG. 6A illustrates an example of a process of classifying financial
   accounts for transaction information collection in a merchant server. Initially, the
   merchant server 104 (e.g., the POS system 104) maintains a database containing
   data identifying financial accounts being classified with a predetermined classification
30 (step 610). To the merchant server 104, the classification does not necessarily
   indicate that the financial accounts have been enrolled for an interactive payment
   service. The classification allows the merchant server 104 to identify the particular
   financial accounts so that the merchant server 104 sends transaction information
   relating to these financial accounts to the payment service system 108.

    WO 2015/179316                                                    PCT/US2015/031423
                                            21
   [0078]         The merchant server 104 receives from a payment service system 108
   an instruction to add a new financial account (step 615). Accordingly, the merchant
   server 104 adds information of the new financial account to the database (step 620).
   [0079]         FIG. 6B illustrates an example of a process of supplying item-level
 5 transaction information by the merchant server 104. The merchant server 104
   initiates a payment transaction when a payment card swipes through a card reader
   connected to merchant server 104 or included in the merchant server 104 (step 625).
   In some alternative embodiments, the merchant server 104 initiates the payment
   transaction when the merchant server 104 receives a request for placing an online
10 purchase order from a user device (e.g., mobile device 102). The merchant server 104
   sends to a processing server of a payment processing entity (e.g., card payment
   network system 116) a payment authorization request for the payment transaction
   (step 630). The payment processing entity can be, e.g., an acquirer, a card payment
   network or an issuer. The payment processing entity may provide a processing fee
15 discount as an incentive for the merchant server 104 to supply the item-level
   transaction information.
   [0080]         The payment processing entity processes the payment transaction
   according to the request (step 632). Then the merchant server 104 receives a
   confirmation of completing the payment transaction in response to the payment
20 authorization request (step 635).
   [0081]         The merchant server 104 determines whether the financial account
   involved in the payment transaction is classified as indicated by the data in the
   database (step 640). If the financial account is classified according to the database,
   the merchant server 104 sends to the payment service system 108 item-level
25 information about goods or services involved in the payment transaction (step 645).
   The payment service system 108 has access to information of the financial account
   and information to enable the payment service system 108 to communicate with
   mobile device 102. If the financial account is not classified according to the database,
   the merchant server 104 does not send transaction information to the payment service
30 system 108 (step 647).
   [0082]         Upon receiving the item-level transaction information (step 650), the
   payment service system 108 generates a digital transaction receipt listing the goods or
   services involved in the payment transaction based on the item-level information (step
   655). A mobile device 102 of the consumer receives and represents the digital

    WO 2015/179316                                                        PCT/US2015/031423
                                              22
   transaction receipt (step 660). The digital transaction receipt, as illustrated in FIGs.
   4A-4B, enables the consumer to interact with the receipt in various ways, such as
   specifying tip amount, entering feedback, confirming the transaction, etc. The
   payment service system 108 is not a participant in processing the payment transaction
 5 and is not in a payment transaction message flow between the merchant's POS
   system 104 and a card issuer or card payment network system 116 involved in the
   transaction.

   storage devices, which may be in the form of random access memory (RAM),
   read-only memory (ROM) (which may be erasable and programmable), flash memory,
   miniature hard disk drive, or other suitable type of storage device, or a combination of
25 such devices. Memory 711 may store data and instructions that configure the
   processor(s) 710 to execute operations in accordance with the techniques described
   above. The communication device 712 may be or include, for example, an Ethernet
   adapter, cable modem, Wi-Fi adapter, cellular transceiver, Bluetooth transceiver, or
   the like, or a combination thereof. Depending on the specific nature and purpose of
30 the processing device 700, the 1/O devices 713 can include devices such as a display
   (which may be a touch screen display), audio speaker, keyboard, mouse or other
   pointing device, microphone, camera, etc.
