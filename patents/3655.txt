                   SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR REDUCING MOISTURE
                                IN A REFRIGERATED ROOM
   TECHNICAL FIELD
 5          This disclosure relates generally to a refrigerated room. More specifically,
   this disclosure relates to a system and method of reducing moisture in a refrigerated
   room.
   BACKGROUND
10          Generally, the temperature within a refrigerated room such as a walk-in
   freezer or walk-in cooler is maintained in part by one or more heat exchanger coils in
   the refrigerated room. The heat exchanger coils are configured to absorb heat from
   the refrigerated room and transfer the heat to refrigerant circulating through the heat
   exchanger coils.      Over time however, moisture within the refrigerated room may
15 accumulate on or around the heat exchanger coils thereby reducing the capability of
   the coils to transfer heat.
   SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
            According to one embodiment, a system includes a desiccant wheel, a motor, a
20 fan, and a heat exchanger. The desiccant wheel is configured to absorb, in a portion
   of the desiccant wheel, moisture from moisturized air received from a refrigerated
   room,    wherein     absorbing  the moisture   from    the  moisturized   air  produces
   dehumidified air. The motor is configured to continually turn the desiccant wheel
   when in operation and the fan is configured to bring in outdoor air.          The heat
25 exchanger is configured to heat the outdoor air using waste heat from a transcritical
   refrigeration system and dry the portion of the desiccant wheel using the heated
   outdoor air.     The system is operable to discharge the dehumidified air to the
   refrigerated room, thereby dehumidifying one or more heat exchanger coils in the
   refrigerated room.
30          According to another embodiment, a method includes receiving moisturized
   air from a refrigerated room and absorbing, in a portion of a desiccant wheel, moisture
   from the moisturized air, wherein absorbing moisture from the moisturized air
   produces dehumidified air. The method further includes discharging the dehumidified
   air to the refrigerated room.
                                               1

           According to yet another embodiment, a controller for a refrigeration system is
   configured to operate a motor configured to turn a desiccant wheel, wherein the
   desiccant wheel is configured to absorb, in a portion of the desiccant wheel, moisture
   from moisturized air received from a refrigerated room, wherein absorbing the
 5 moisture from the moisturized air produces dehumidified air that is discharged to the
   refrigerated room.
           Certain embodiments may provide one or more technical advantages.           For
   example, an embodiment of the present disclosure may result in more efficient heat
   transfer of coils in a refrigerated room. As another example, an embodiment of the
10 present invention may reduce the time required to defrost coils in a refrigerated room.
   As yet another example, an embodiment of the present disclosure may provide
   supplemental cooling to refrigerant circulating through the refrigeration system.
   Certain embodiments may include none, some, or all of the above technical
   advantages. One or more other technical advantages may be readily apparent to one
15 skilled in the art from the figures, descriptions, and claims included herein.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
           Embodiments of the present disclosure and its advantages are best understood
   by referring to FIGURES 1 through 4 of the drawings, like numerals being used for
   like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.
 5         Moisture is commonly present in refrigerated rooms such as walk-in freezers
   or walk-in coolers used to store refrigerated food and beverages in grocery stores.
   Over time, moisture in a refrigerated room results in frost accumulation on or around
   one or more heat exchanger coils of the refrigerated room. The frost accumulation on
   or around the heat exchanger coils reduces the ability of the coils to transfer heat
10 efficiently, thereby causing the temperature inside the refrigerated room to increase to
   undesirable temperatures. Increased temperatures inside a refrigerated room may lead
   to additional energy consumption and/or food and drink spoilage which may
   correspond to increased costs. In conventional refrigeration systems, this problem is
   solved by defrosting (e.g., melting) the coils using electrical energy.      Because the
15 coils cannot simultaneously provide heating and cooling, the refrigeration cycle is
   shut down during a defrost cycle and the refrigeration cycle is restarted once the coils
   have melted the accumulated frost. In some cases, this cycling occurs multiple times
   per day. For example, coils in a walk-in freezer may require defrosting six times a
   day. As another example, coils in a walk-in cooler may require defrosting three times
20 a day.    Accordingly, the traditional solution is not energy efficient and is costly.
   Additionally,    the  traditional  solution  may    cause  undesirable    fluctuating  in
   refrigeration and may cause harm to the refrigeration system.            This disclosure
   recognizes a dehumidification system that removes moisture from a refrigerated room
   and provides dehumidified air to the refrigerated room.        As will be explained in
25 further detail below, the disclosed system comprises a desiccant wheel configured to
   absorb moisture from moisturized air which may be dried by heat reclaimed from a
   refrigeration system. In doing so, the system reduces the amount of energy and time
   required to defrost heat exchanger coils relative to conventional refrigeration systems.
           As discussed above, in certain embodiments, a dehumidification system may
30 be configured to reclaim waste heat from a refrigeration system in order to perform
   dehumidification using a desiccant wheel.       In certain embodiments, the desiccant
   wheel may be positioned within a duct above the refrigerated room. The duct may be
   open on both ends such that a first end is configured to receive outdoor air (e.g., from
   an outdoor environment) and the second end is configured to direct moisturized
                                               3

   heated outdoor air to the outdoor environment. As will be explained in more detail
   below, the first end of the duct may be configured to receive outdoor air that has been
   heated using reclaimed waste heat from a refrigeration system. The heated outdoor
   air may then be directed, within the duct, to dry a moisturized portion of a desiccant
 5 wheel. As the heated outdoor air is applied to the moisturized portion of the desiccant
   wheel, the heated outdoor air passing through the desiccant wheel becomes
   moisturized (e.g., moisture from the moisturized portion of the wheel is transferred
   into the heated outdoor air). This moisturized, heated outdoor air is then directed to
   the outdoor environment. In some embodiments, discharging the moisturized, heated
10 outdoor air yields various benefits over other dehumidification systems.         As an
   example, conventional dehumidification systems may reuse moisturized, heated
   outdoor air and apply separate processes (which may require additional energy) to
   dehumidify the moisturized, heated outdoor air. This disclosure recognizes simply
   removing this air from the duct, thereby eliminating the need for a separate
15 dehumidification step.
           FIGURE 1 illustrates an example of a refrigeration system 100 interconnected
   to a dehumidification system 200.      As will be disclosed herein, dehumidification
   system 200 may be operable to use waste heat from refrigeration system 100 to
   provide dehumidified air to refrigerated room           150. In some embodiments,
20 refrigeration system 100 is a transcritical refrigeration system that circulates a
   transcritical refrigerant such as C02. Refrigeration system 100 may include one or
   more compressors 105, one or more heat exchangers 110, 115, an expansion valve
   120, a flash tank 125, one or more valves 130 corresponding to one or more
   evaporators 135, and a flash tank valve 140. Generally, refrigeration system 100 is
25 operable to provide cold liquid refrigerant to evaporators 135. The evaporators 135
   discharge refrigerant vapor to compressors 105 to be compressed into high pressure,
   hot vapor which is then cooled by one or more heat exchangers 110, 115 and
   discharged to expansion valve 120 prior to returning to evaporators 135.
           In addition to being a component of refrigeration system 100, heat exchanger
30 110 may be a component of dehumidification system 200. In some embodiments,
   heat exchanger 110 may apply waste heat from refrigeration system 100 to
   dehumidification system 200, which in turn provides supplemental cooling to
   refrigerant circulating through refrigeration system 100. As depicted in FIGURES 1
   and 2, the waste heat of refrigeration system 100 is used to heat outdoor air directed
                                               4

   into heat exchanger 110 by fan 145.           The heated air may then be used to dry a
   desiccant wheel 165 that is configured to absorb moisture from moisturized air
   supplied from a refrigerated room 150.         As a result, dehumidification system may
   discharge dehumidified air back to refrigerated room 150.         In some embodiments,
 5 operation of such a system results in one or more of: reduced defrost time of heat
   exchanger coils (e.g., coils 15) of refrigerated room 150 relative to traditional system,
   reduced energy consumption relative to traditional systems, and supplemental cooling
   of refrigerant circulating through refrigeration system 100.
            As described above,       refrigeration  system    100 includes   one or more
10 compressors 105.      Refrigeration system 100 may include any suitable number of
   compressors 105. For example, as depicted in FIGURE 1, refrigeration system 100
   includes two compressors 105a-b. Compressors 105 may vary by design and/or by
   capacity. For example, some compressor designs may be more energy efficient than
   other compressor designs and some compressors 105 may have modular capacity (i.e.,
15 capability to vary capacity). In certain embodiments, compressor 105a may be a low
   temperature ("LT") compressor that is configured to compress refrigerant discharged
   from a LT evaporator (e.g., evaporator 135a) and compressor 105b may be a medium
   temperature ("MT") compressor that is configured to compress refrigerant discharged
   from a MT evaporator (e.g., MT evaporator 135b) and provide supplemental
20 compression     to refrigerant discharged from compressor           105a.     Accordingly,
   compressors 105 may be operable to receive refrigerant discharged from evaporators
   135 and compress the received refrigerant. In some embodiments, compressors 105
   discharge compressed       refrigerant   directly to heat exchanger      110.    In other
   embodiments, refrigerant discharged from compressors 105 is directed to another
25 component of refrigeration system 100. In some embodiments, refrigeration system
   100 may include a valve (not depicted) configured to be opened and closed based on
   instructions from a controller (e.g., controller 170 of FIGURE 1).             In such an
   embodiment, controller 170 may open and close such valve (e.g., two-way valve or
   three-way valve) to allow refrigerant to flow directly to one or more of: heat
30 exchanger 115, an oil separator (not depicted), and gas cooler 115.
            In some embodiments, refrigeration system 100 comprises one or more heat
   exchangers.    As depicted in FIGURE 1, refrigeration system 100 includes two heat
   exchangers: heat reclaim heat exchanger 110 and gas cooler 115.                  In some
   embodiments, heat exchanger 110 and gas cooler 115 are operable to receive
                                                  5

   refrigerant and apply a cooling stage to the received refrigerant. As an example, heat
   exchanger    110 may receive refrigerant having a temperature of 120'C from
   compressor 105b, apply a first cooling stage to the received refrigerant, and discharge
   the cooled refrigerant having a temperature of 100 0 C to gas cooler 115. As another
 5 example, gas cooler 110 may receive refrigerant having a temperature of 1 000 C from
   heat exchanger 115, apply a second cooling stage to the received refrigerant, and
   discharge the cooled refrigerant at a temperature of 40'C to expansion valve 120. In
   some embodiments, refrigerant may be cooled between 5'K and 35'K during the first
   cooling stage and may be cooled between cooled between 40'K and 80'K during the
10 second cooling stage. In addition to performing operations for refrigeration system
   100, heat exchanger 110 may also perform operations for dehumidification system
   200. For example, heat exchanger 110 may receive outdoor air (e.g., being brought in
   via fan 145), apply a heating stage to the outdoor air using waste heat of refrigeration
   system 100, and direct the heated outdoor air to dry a desiccant wheel that absorbs
15 moisture from moisturized air from refrigerated room 150. These functions will be
   described in more detail below in reference to FIGURE 2.
           Refrigeration system 100 may also comprise an expansion valve 120. In some
   embodiments, expansion valve 120 is configured to receive liquid refrigerant from gas
   cooler 115 and to reduce the pressure of received refrigerant. For example, gas cooler
20 115 may discharge liquid refrigerant having a pressure of 90 bar to expansion valve
   120, and the refrigerant may be discharged from expansion valve 120 having a
   pressure of 40 bar. In some embodiments, this reduction in pressure causes some of
   the liquid refrigerant to vaporize. As a result, mixed-state refrigerant (e.g., refrigerant
   vapor and liquid refrigerant) is discharged from expansion valve 120.             In some
25 embodiments, this mixed-state refrigerant is discharged to flash tank 125.
           Refrigeration system 100 may include a flash tank 150 in some embodiments.
   Flash tank 150 may be configured to receive mixed-state refrigerant (e.g., from
   expansion valve 120) and separate the received refrigerant into flash gas and liquid
   refrigerant. Typically, the flash gas collects near the top of flash tank 125 and the
30 liquid refrigerant is collected in the bottom of flash tank 125. In some embodiments,
   the liquid refrigerant flows from flash tank 125 and provides cooling to one or more
   evaporators (cases) 135 and the flash gas flows to one or more compressors (e.g.,
   compressor 105b) for compression before being discharged to heat exchanger 110
   and/or gas cooler 115 cooling.
                                                6

            Refrigeration system 100 may include one or more evaporators 135 in some
   embodiments.      As depicted in FIGURE 1, refrigeration system 100 includes two
   evaporators 135a, 135b. In some embodiments, evaporators 135 are refrigerated cases
   and/or coolers for storing food and/or beverages that must be kept at particular
 5 temperatures. As depicted in FIGURE 1, first evaporator 135a is a low-temperature
   case ("LT" case 170a) and second evaporator 135b is a medium-temperature case
   ("MT case" 170b). LT case 135a may be configured to receive liquid refrigerant of a
   first temperature and MT case 135b may be configured to receive liquid refrigerant of
   a second temperature, wherein the first temperature (e.g., -30'C) is lower in
10 temperature than the second temperature (e.g., -6'C). As an example, LT case 135a
   may be a freezer in a grocery store and MT case 170b may be a cooler in a grocery
   store. In some embodiments, the liquid refrigerant leaving flash tank 125 is the same
   temperature and pressure (e.g., 4'C and 38 bar) as the refrigerant discharged from
   expansion valve 120.      Before reaching cases 135, the liquid refrigerant may be
15 directed through one or more evaporator valves 130 (e.g., 130a and 130b of FIGURE
   1). In some embodiments, each valve 130 may be controlled (e.g., by controller 170
   of FIGURE 1) to adjust the temperature and pressure of the liquid refrigerant.      For
   example, valve 130a may be configured to discharge the liquid refrigerant at -30'C
   and 14 bar to LT case 135a and valve 130b may be configured to discharge the liquid
20 refrigerant at -6'C and 30 bar to MT case 135b.            In some embodiments, each
   evaporator 135 is associated with a particular valve 130 and the valve 130 controls the
   temperature and pressure of the liquid refrigerant that reaches the evaporator 135.
            System 100 may also include a flash gas valve 140 in some embodiments.
   Flash gas valve 140 may be configured to open and close to permit or restrict the flow
25 through of flash gas discharged from flash tank 125.            In some embodiments,
   controller 170 controls the opening and closing of flash gas valve 140. As depicted in
   FIGURE 1, closing flash gas valve 140 may restrict flash gas from flowing to second
   compressor 105b.
            Although this disclosure describes and depicts refrigeration system 100
30 including certain components, this disclosure recognizes that refrigeration system 100
   may include any suitable components. As described above, refrigeration system 100
   may include controller 170 operable to communicate with one or more components of
   refrigeration system 100. For example, controller 170 may be configured to control
   the operation of valves 120, 130a, 130b, 140.          As was also described above,
                                               7

   refrigeration system 100 may include an oil separator (not depicted) operable to
   separate compressor oil from the refrigerant. As another example, refrigeration system
   100 may include one or more sensors configured to detect information about
   refrigeration system 100 (e.g., temperature and/or pressure information).         One of
 5 ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that refrigeration system 100 may include other
   components not mentioned herein.
           In addition to controlling       operations of one or more components of
   refrigeration   system 100, controller      170 may also be configured to operate
   components of dehumidification system 200. As an example, controller 170 may be
10 configured to power fan 145 on or off and/or increase or decrease the speed of fan
   145. As another example, controller 170 may be configured to operate a motor (e.g.,
   motor 225) configured to turn desiccant wheel 165.              As yet another example,
   controller 170 may be configured to receive information about humidity status within
   refrigerated room 150 via one or more sensors (not depicted) in refrigerated room
15 150.
           Generally, FIGURE 1 illustrates using waste heat of refrigeration system 100
   to facilitate the dehumidification of refrigerated room 150. Specifically, FIGURE 1
   depicts outdoor air being directed into heat exchanger 110 by fan 145.              Heat
   exchanger 110 uses waste heat of refrigeration system 100 to heat the outdoor air
20 which is then directed through a duct 160 and applied to a moisturized portion of
   desiccant wheel 165.       The heated outdoor air dries the moisturized portion of
   desiccant wheel 165 and the applied air is then directed to the outdoor environment.
   This disclosure recognizes that desiccant wheel 165 may be configured to turn (e.g.,
   by motor 225 of FIGURE 2) such that the dried portion of desiccant wheel 165 may
25 subsequently absorb moisture from moisturized air directed into duct 160 from
   refrigerated room 150. FIGURE 2 depicts an enlarged schematic of dehumidification
   system 200 and FIGURE 3 illustrates a method 300 of dehumidification system 200
   which may reduce moisture in a refrigerated room. Finally, FIGURE 4 illustrates a
   controller configured to execute method 300 in dehumidification system 200.
30         As described above, FIGURE 1 illustrates refrigeration system 100 operating
   in cooperation with dehumidification system 200.           Heat exchanger 110 may be a
   shared component of refrigeration system 100 and dehumidification system 200 and
   may be configured to perform one or more refrigeration functions and one or more
   dehumidification functions. For example, heat exchanger 110 may be configured to
                                                 8

   apply a cooling stage to refrigerant circulating through refrigeration system 100 and
   apply a heating stage to outdoor air used by dehumidification system 200.            As
   explained above, removing moisture from refrigerated room 150 may be beneficial for
   a number of reasons. For example, moisture within refrigerated room 150 may freeze
 5 on/around heat exchanger coils 155 thereby impeding the ability of coils 155 to
   transfer heat. As a result, heat that would otherwise be absorbed by coils 155 may
   persist within refrigerated room 150 and cause the temperature within refrigerated
   room 150 to increase. In some embodiments, refrigerated room 150 may be a walk-in
   freezer and/or a walk-in cooler.     As an example, refrigerated room 150 may be a
10 walk-in cold room configured to store overstock products within a grocery store.
   Each refrigerated room 150 may comprise one or more heat exchanger coils 155
   configured to transfer heat (e.g., provide cooling to refrigerated room 150 while
   simultaneously absorbing heat within refrigerated room 150). Coils 155 may, in some
   embodiments, be located within a duct in/ above the ceiling of refrigerated room 150.
15 As depicted in FIGURES 1 and 2, coils 155 are located in a ceiling of refrigerated
   room 150 and are connected to duct 160.        As described above, coils 155 may be
   obstructed or impeded (e.g., because of frost accumulation) due to moisture within
   refrigerated room 150.       Accordingly, this disclosure recognizes dehumidifying
   moisturized air within refrigerated room 150 using dehumidification system 200.
20         As depicted in FIGURES 1 and 2, moisturized air exits refrigerated room 150
   via refrigerated room outlet 205 and is directed to duct 160 via inlet 210.         The
   moisturized air may be dehumidified within duct 160 and the dehumidified air is
   discharged to refrigerated room 150. In some embodiments, the dehumidified air may
   exit duct 160 via outlet 215 and enter refrigerated room 150 via refrigerated room
25 inlet 220.   In this manner, moisture may be removed from refrigerated room 150,
   thereby decreasing the amount of moisture in refrigerated room 150 which can turn
   into frost and accumulate on or around coils 155.
           Turning now to FIGURE 2, dehumidification system 200 comprises fan 145,
   heat exchanger 110, desiccant wheel 165, and motor 225.            As explained above,
30 dehumidification system 200 may reduce moisture in refrigerated room 150 by
   dehumidifying moisturized air from refrigerated room 150 and supplying refrigerated
   room 150 with dehumidified air.        In some embodiments, desiccant wheel 165 is
   located within a duct 160 (e.g., duct above the ceiling of refrigerated room 150). Duct
   160 may, in some embodiments, comprise a top portion 160a and a bottom portion
                                               9

   160b. As will be described in further detail below, drying of desiccant wheel 165
   may occur in top portion 160a and the absorption of moisture by desiccant wheel 165
   may occur in bottom portion 160b.          In some embodiments, desiccant material
   configured to absorb moisture covers desiccant wheel 165 thereby defining a first
 5 surface 230 and a second surface 235.          To aid in the following description of
   dehumidification system 200, reference will be made to quadrants I-IV (QI, QII, QIII,
   QIV), defined by the configuration of desiccant wheel 165 within duct 160.
   Reference to QI will refer to the area within top portion 160a of duct 160 including
   first surface 230 of desiccant wheel 165, reference to QII will refer to the area within
10 top portion 160a of duct 160 including second surface 235 of desiccant wheel 165,
   reference to QIII will refer to the area within bottom portion 160b of duct 160
   including first surface 230 of desiccant wheel 165, and QIV will refer to the area
   within bottom portion 160b of duct 160 including second surface 235 of desiccant
   wheel 165.
15          In some embodiments, desiccant wheel 165 is rotated by motor 225. Motor
   225 may be controlled by one or more controllers. As an example, motor 225 may be
   controlled by controller 170.     In some embodiments, controller 170 may operate
   motor, which in turn rotates desiccant wheel 165, based on a humidity of refrigerated
   room 150. As an example, controller 170 may be configured to operate motor 225
20 when the humidity in refrigerated room 150 reaches 70%. In some embodiments, the
   humidity in refrigerated room 150 is determined by one or more sensors in
   refrigerated room 150.     In other embodiments, controller 170 operates motor 225
   based on a temperature and/or a power status of refrigerated room 150. For example,
   controller 170 may operate motor 225 only when refrigerated room 150 is being
25 cooled (e.g., not when refrigerated room 150 is not in operation). Controller 170 may
   cause motor 225 to turn desiccant wheel 165 continuously or periodically.
            As motor 225 turns desiccant wheel 165, different portions of desiccant
   material may be exposed to one or more of moisturized air from refrigerated room
   150 (e.g., in QIII) and heated outdoor air directed into duct 160 by heat exchanger 110
30 (e.g., in QI). As described above, fan 145 may pull in outdoor air which is heated by
   heat exchanger 110 using the waste heat of refrigeration system 100. As an example,
   heat exchanger 110 may apply a heating stage to outdoor air and increase the
   temperature of outdoor air from 30 C to 90'C. Heat exchanger 110 may then direct
   the heated air into QI of duct 160a where it is applied to a moisturized portion of
                                               10

   desiccant wheel 165 (e.g., portion of desiccant material that absorbed moisture from
   the moisturized air from refrigerated room 150). In some embodiments, the heated
   outdoor air is applied to the portion of desiccant wheel in QI (e.g., first surface 230 of
   desiccant wheel in top portion 160a of duct 160). In some embodiments, applying the
 5 heated outdoor air to the moisturized portion of desiccant wheel 165 dries the portion
   of desiccant wheel 165. As a result, the moisture from desiccant wheel 165 passes
   into the heated outdoor air (e.g., in QII) which is directed to an outdoor environment.
           Bottom portion 160b of duct 160 may be configured to receive moisturized air
   from refrigerated room 150 which is then dehumidified and discharged to refrigerated
10 room 150.       In some embodiments, moisturized air exits refrigerated room via
   refrigerated room outlet 205 and enters QIII of duct 160 via inlet 210. Upon entering
   QIII, the moisturized air contacts second surface 235 of desiccant wheel 165.
   Accordingly, the portion of desiccant wheel 165 exposed to the moisturized air (e.g.,
   the portion of desiccant wheel 165 in QIII) will absorb moisture from the moisturized
15 air, thereby producing dehumidified air that passes through first surface 230 of
   desiccant wheel 165 into QIV of duct 160. The dehumidified air may then be directed
   out from QIV via outlet 215 to refrigerated room 150 via refrigerated room inlet 220.
           The following is a description of a cycle of operation for dehumidifying
   refrigerated room 150 using the system described above. In operation, moisturized air
20 from refrigerated room 150 is directed to QIII where it contacts a first surface of a
   portion of desiccant wheel 165. The portion of desiccant material absorbs moisture
   from the moisturized air, thereby producing dehumidified air, and the dehumidified
   air passes through the second surface of the portion of desiccant wheel 165 (e.g., into
   QIV) and is directed to refrigerated room 150. In some embodiments, the moisturized
25 air exits refrigerated room 150 through refrigerated room outlet 205 and enters the
   duct through an inlet (e.g., inlet 210). In some embodiments, the dehumidified air
   exits duct 160 through an outlet (e.g., outlet 215) and enters refrigerated room 150 via
   refrigerated room inlet 220.         In some embodiments, desiccant wheel 165 is
   continuously turned by motor 225 such that the portion of desiccant wheel 165 that
30 absorbed the moisture is exposed to outdoor air that has been heated by waste heat
   from refrigeration system 100 by heat exchanger 110. The heated outdoor air may be
   applied to the portion of desiccant wheel 165 that absorbed the moisture, thereby
   drying the portion of desiccant wheel 165 and forcing the moisture into air that is
   discharged to the outdoor environment. The now-dried portion of desiccant wheel
                                               11

   165 may subsequently be exposed to moisturized air (e.g., by turning desiccant wheel
   165 with motor 225) from refrigerated room 150 and the process can begin anew.
           FIGURE 3 illustrates a method of operation for dehumidification system 200.
   In some embodiments, the method 300 may be implemented by a controller of
 5 dehumidification system 200 (e.g., controller 170 of FIGURE 1). Method 300 may be
   stored on a computer readable medium, such as a memory of controller 170 (e.g.,
   memory 420 of FIGURE 4), as a series of operating instructions that direct the
   operation of a processor (e.g., processor 430 of FIGURE 4).      Method 300 may be
   associated with efficiency benefits such as reduced power consumption relative to
10 conventional methods of defrosting heat exchange coils 155 of a refrigerated room
   150. In some embodiments, the method 300 begins in step 305 and continues to step
   310.
           At step 310, the system 200 receives moisturized air from a refrigerated room
   150. As explained above, moisture develops within refrigerated room 150 over time
15 and can lead to frost accumulation on/around coils 155. In some embodiments, the
   moisturized air is directed out of refrigerated room 150 via refrigerated room outlet
   205 and directed into QIII of duct 160 via inlet 210.     In some embodiments, the
   method 300 continues to a step 320.
           At step 320, the system 200 absorbs moisture from the moisturized air in a
20 portion of desiccant wheel 165. In some embodiments, the component of system 200
   that absorbs moisture from the moisturized air is desiccant wheel 165. As described
   above, desiccant wheel 165 may be located within duct 160 and may comprise
   desiccant material configured to absorb moisture. As such, the desiccant material of
   desiccant wheel 165 in QIII of duct 160 may absorb the moisture from the
25 moisturized air received at step 310.      In some embodiments, the moisturized air
   becomes dehumidified air as it passes through desiccant wheel 165 from QIII to QIV.
   In some embodiments, the method 300 continues to a step 330.
           At step 330, the system 200 discharges the dehumidified air to refrigerated
   room 150. As explained above, the moisture from the moisturized air is absorbed by
30 the desiccant material of desiccant wheel 165 at step 320, thereby producing
   dehumidified air. The system 200 may discharge the dehumidified air from QIV to
   refrigerated room 150 via outlet 215 and refrigerated room inlet 220.         In some
   embodiments, the method 300 continues to an end step 335.
                                               12

           The method 300 may include one or more additional steps in some
   embodiments. As an example, the method 300 includes steps that may occur in top
   portion 160b of duct 160. Thus, in some embodiments, the method 300 may include
   one or more of the following steps: bringing in outdoor air from an outdoor
 5 environment;      heating the outdoor air using waste heat from a transcritical
   refrigeration system; and drying the portion of the desiccant wheel using the heated
   outdoor air to produce moisturized outdoor air. In some embodiments, the component
   of system 200 that brings in outdoor air from an outdoor environment may be fan 145
   and the component of system 200 that heats the outdoor air using waste heat from a
10 transcritical refrigeration system may be heat exchanger        110.   Although this
   disclosure describes and depicts certain steps of method 300, this disclosure
   recognizes that method 400 may comprise any suitable step.
           FIGURE 4 illustrates an example controller 400 of dehumidification system
   200 and/or refrigeration system 100, according to certain embodiments of the present
15 disclosure.   In some embodiments, controller 400 may be an example of controller
   170 described herein in relation to FIGURE 1. Controller 400 may comprise one or
   more interfaces 410, memory 420, and one or more processors 430. Interface 410
   receives input (e.g., sensor data or system data), sends output (e.g., instructions),
   processes the input and/or output, and/or performs other suitable operation. Interface
20 410 may comprise hardware and/or software. As an example, interface 410 receives
   information (e.g., temperature, operation, speed, pressure information) about one or
   more components of systems 100, 200 (e.g., via sensors).
           Memory (or memory unit) 420 stores information. As an example, memory
   420 may store method 300. Memory 420 may comprise one or more non-transitory,
25 tangible, computer-readable, and/or computer-executable storage media. Examples of
   memory 420 include computer memory (for example, Random Access Memory
   (RAM) or Read Only Memory (ROM)), mass storage media (for example, a hard
   disk), removable storage media (for example, a Compact Disk (CD) or a Digital
   Video Disk (DVD)), database and/or network storage (for example, a server), and/or
30 other computer-readable medium.
           Processor 430 may include any suitable combination of hardware and software
   implemented in one or more modules to execute instructions and manipulate data to
   perform some or all of the described functions of controller 400. In some
   embodiments, processor 430 may include, for example, one or more computers, one
                                              13

   or more central processing units (CPUs), one or more microprocessors, one or more
   applications, one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), one or more
   field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and/or other logic.
           Embodiments of the present disclosure may have one or more technical
 5 advantages.    In certain embodiments, a heat exchanger downstream the gas cooler
   provides supplemental cooling to refrigerant, thereby reducing the amount of power
   of other refrigeration system components configured to cool the refrigerant.
   Additionally, the waste heat produced by the downstream heat exchanger may be
   reclaimed by other facility systems (e.g., floor heating system, water heating system),
10 thereby reducing the amount of power of compressors 105.
           Although this disclosure describes and depicts a configuration of a transcritical
   refrigeration system including a heat exchanger downstream from the gas cooler, this
   disclosure recognizes other similar applications.        For example, this disclosure
   recognizes a configuration of a conventional refrigeration system comprising a heat
15 exchanger downstream from a condenser.         The downstream heat exchanger would
   provide supplemental cooling to refrigerant circulating through the conventional
   refrigeration system, thereby reducing the power consumption of compressors 105.
   Additionally, the waste heat produced as a result of operation of the downstream heat
   exchanger could be reclaimed and used by other facility systems.
20         This disclosure also recognizes dehydrating food in a similar manner. Taking
   FIGURE 1 as an example, dehumidification system 200 may be configured to remove
   moisture from a food dehydrator (not depicted) in some embodiments.          In such an
   embodiment, moisturized air within a food dehydrator may be directed to a duct 160
   comprising a desiccant wheel 165 configured to absorb moisture from the moisturized
25 air. In doing so, the moisturized air becomes dehumidified air which may then be
   directed back to food dehydrator.      The portion of the desiccant wheel 165 that
   absorbed the moisture may then be dried using outdoor air heated using waste heat
   from a refrigeration system (e.g., refrigeration system 100 of FIGURE 1).          After
   drying the portion of moisturized portion of the desiccant wheel 165, the dried portion
30 may be re-exposed to moisturized air from the food dehydrator to begin the cycle
   anew.
           Modifications,   additions, or omissions may be made to the systems,
   apparatuses, and methods described herein without departing from the scope of the
   disclosure.   The components of the systems and apparatuses may be integrated or
                                               14

   separated.     Moreover, the operations of the systems and apparatuses may be
   performed by more, fewer, or other components. For example, refrigeration system
   100 may include any suitable number of compressors, condensers, condenser fans,
   evaporators, valves, sensors, controllers, and so on, as performance demands dictate.
 5 One skilled in the art will also understand that refrigeration system 100 can include
   other components that are not illustrated but are typically included with refrigeration
   systems. Additionally, operations of the systems and apparatuses may be performed
   using any suitable logic comprising software, hardware, and/or other logic. As used
   in this document, "each" refers to each member of a set or each member of a subset of
10 a set.
            Further, throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the
   context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises"
   and "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step
   or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group

   herein without departing from the scope of the disclosure. The methods may include
   more, fewer, or other steps. Additionally, steps may be performed in any suitable
   order.
20          Although this disclosure has been described in terms of certain embodiments,
   alterations and permutations of the embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in
   the art. Accordingly, the above description of the embodiments does not constrain
   this disclosure.    Other changes, substitutions, and alterations are possible without
