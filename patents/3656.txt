       Field of the Invention
10002]          The present invention relates generally to the field of therapeutics for hemostatic
       disorders.
       Background Art
10003]          Hemophilia A is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by mutations and/or deletions in
       the factor VIII (FVIII) gene resulting in a deficiency of FVIII activity (Peyvandi, F. et al.
       Haemophilia 12:82-89 (2006). The disease is characterized by spontaneous hemorrhage and
       excessive bleeding after trauma. Over time, the repeated bleeding into muscles and joints, which
       often begins in early childhood, results in hemophilic arthropathy and irreversible joint damage.
       This damage is progressive and can lead to severely limited mobility of joints, muscle atrophy
       and chronic pain (Rodriguez-Merchan, E.C., Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 29:87-96 (2003), which is
       herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).
10004]          The A2 domain is necessary for the procoagulant activity of the factor VIII molecule.
       Studies show that porcine factor VIII has six-fold greater procoagulant activity than human
       factor VIII (Lollar, P., and E. T. Parker, J. Biol. Chem. 266: 12481-12486 (1991)), and that the
       difference in coagulant activity between human and porcine factor VIII appears to be based on a
       difference in amino acid sequence between one or more residues in the human and porcine A2
       domains (Lollar, P., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:23652-23657 (1992)), incorporated herein by
       reference in its entirety.
10005]          Treatment of hemophilia A is by replacement therapy targeting restoration of FVIII
       activity to I to 5 % of normal levels to prevent spontaneous bleeding (Mannucci, P.M., et al., N.
       Engl. J. Med. 344:1773-1779 (2001), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).
       There are plasma-derived and recombinant FVIII products available to treat bleeding episodes
                                                   -1-

on-demand or to prevent bleeding episodes from occurring by treating prophylactically. Based on the
short half-life of these products, however, e.g., 8-12 hours, treatment regimens require the
                                                    - la-

       administration of frequent intravenous injections.     Such frequent administration is painful and
       inconvenient.
[0006]          Reduced mortality, prevention of joint damage and improved quality of life have been
       important achievements due to the development of plasma-derived and recombinant FVIII.
       Prolonged protection from bleeding would represent another key advancement in the treatment of
       hemophilia A patients.       However, to date, no products that allow for prolonged hemostatic
       protection have been developed.        Therefore, there remains a need for improved methods of
       treating hemophilia due to factor VIII deficiency that are more tolerable, longer lasting, and more
       effective than current therapies.
                              BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

       thereof, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic dose of a chimeric Factor VIII
       polypeptide, e.g., a chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptide, at a dosing interval at least about one
       and one-half times longer than the dosing interval required for an equivalent dose of said Factor
       VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion),
       e.g., without the Fc portion.
[0009]          The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half to six times longer, one and
       one-half to five times longer, one and one-half to four times longer, one and one-half to three

       polypeptide, e.g., a chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptide, to obtain an area under the plasma
       concentration versus time curve (AUC) at least about one and one-quarter times greater than the
       AUC obtained by an equivalent dose of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion (a
       polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., without the Fc portion.
[0012]          The present invention also provides a method of administering Factor VIII to a subject in

       themselves, polynucleotides encoding them, a cultured human embryonic cells comprising the
       polynucleotides, and methods of producing such chimeric and hybrid polypeptides, and the
       polypeptides produced by such methods.
[0028]          The present invention also provide a chimeric polypeptide that has Factor VIII activity
       comprising a Factor VIII portion and a second portion, wherein the Factor VIII portion is
       processed Factor VIII comprising two chains, a first chain comprising a heavy chain and a second
       chain comprising a light chain, wherein said first chain and said second chain are associated by a
       metal bond. For example, at least about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%,
       about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, or about 99% of the Factor VIII portion of the chimeric

[0029]          In addition, the present invention includes a chimeric polypeptide that has Factor VIII
       activity, wherein the Factor VIII portion is single chain Factor VIII.     In one aspect, the single
       chain Factor VIII can contain an intact intracellular processing site. In one embodiment, at least
       about 1%, about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 2 0%, or about       25
                                                                               % of the Factor VIII portion
       of the chimeric polypeptide is single chain Factor VIII. In another embodiment, at least about
       3 %
         0  , about 4 0%, about 50%, about  60
                                               %, about 7 0%, about 8 0%, about  90

       99% of the Factor VIII portion of the chimeric polypeptide is single chain Factor VIII. In another
       aspect, the single chain FVIII does not contain an intracellular processing site. For example, the
       SCFVIII comprises a substitution or mutation at an amino acid position corresponding to
       Arginine 1645, a substitution or mutation at an amino acid position corresponding to Arginine
       1648, or a substitution or mutation at amino acid positions corresponding to Arginine 1645 and
       Arginine 1648 in full-length Factor VIII. The amino acid substituted at the amino acid position
       corresponding to Arginine 1645 is a different amino acid from the amino acid substituted at the
       amino acid position corresponding to Arginine 1648. In certain embodiments, the substitution or
       mutation is an amino acid other than arginine, e.g., alanine.

       and processed Factor VIII, which is fused to one of the two Fc portions, when the Factor VIII
       activity is measured in vitro by a chromogenic assay.         In other embodiments, the chimeric
       polypeptide comprising single chain Factor VIII has Factor VIII activity in vivo comparable to a
                                                   -5-

       chimeric polypeptide consisting of two Fc portions and processed Factor VIII, which is fused to
       one of the two Fc portions.     In still other embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide comprising
       single chain Factor VIII has a Factor Xa generation rate comparable to a chimeric polypeptide
       consisting of two Fc portions and processed Factor VIII, which is fused to one of the two Fc
       portions.   In certain embodiments, single chain Factor VIII in the chimeric polypeptide is
       inactivated by activated Protein C at a level comparable to processed Factor VIII in a chimeric
       polypeptide consisting of two Fc portions and processed Factor VIII. In yet other embodiments,
       the single chain Factor VIII in the chimeric polypeptide has a Factor IXa interaction rate
       comparable to processed Factor VIII in a chimeric polypeptide consisting of two Fc portions and
       processed Factor VIII.    In further embodiments, the single chain Factor VIII in the chimeric
       polypeptide binds to von Willebrand Factor at a level comparable to processed Factor VIII in a
       chimeric polypeptide consisting of two Fc portions and the processed Factor VIII.
[0031]          The present invention further includes a composition comprising a chimeric polypeptide
       having Factor VIII activity, wherein at least about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about
       7 %
         0  , about 80%, about 90%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, or about
       100% of said polypeptide comprises a Factor VIII portion, which is single chain Factor VIII, and
       a second portion, wherein said single chain Factor VIII is at least 90% or 95% identical to a
       Factor VIII amino acid sequence shown in Table 2 without a signal sequence (amino acids 20 to
       1457 of SEQ ID NO:2 or amino acids 20 to 2351 of SEQ ID NO:6).             In one embodiment, the
       second portion can be an Fc. In another embodiment, the polypeptide is in the form of a hybrid
       comprising a second polypeptide, wherein said second polypeptide consists essentially of an Fc.
       In other embodiments, the polypeptide has a half-life at least one and one-half to six times longer,
       one and one-half to five times longer, one and one-half to four times longer, one and one-half to
       three times longer, or one and one-half to two times longer to a polypeptide consisting of said
       Factor VIII.

       therapeutically effective amount of the composition. The treatment can be prophylactic treatment
       or on-demand treatment or perioperative. The bleeding coagulation disorder can be hemophilia.

       wherein a VWF level of at least about 100 IU/dL identifies the subject as having a high level of
       VWF; and (b) administering to the subject an effective amount of a long-acting FVIII protein.
[0034]           In one embodiment, the subject is a human.           In another embodiment, the subject is a
       pediatric subject. In another embodiment, the subject has hemophilia A.

                          DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0075]          The present invention provides a method of treating Hemophilia A with Factor VIII
       (processed, single chain, or a combination thereof) using a longer dosing interval and/or greater
       AUC than is possible with currently known Factor VIII products. The present invention also
       provides improved Factor VIII chimeric polypeptides and methods of production.
[0076]          Treatment of hemophilia A is by replacement therapy targeting restoration of FVIII
       activity to 1 to 5 % of normal levels to prevent spontaneous bleeding (Mannucci, P.M. et al., N.
       Engl. J. Med. 344:1773-9 (2001), herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).      There are
       plasma-derived and recombinant FVIII products available to treat bleeding episodes on-demand
       or to prevent bleeding episodes from occurring by treating prophylactically. Based on the short
       half-life of these products (8-12 hr) (White G.C., et al., Thromb. Haemost. 77:660-7 (1997);
       Morfini, M., Haemophilia 9 (suppl 1):94-99; discussion 100 (2003)), treatment regimens require
       frequent intravenous administration, commonly two to three times weekly for prophylaxis and
       one to three times daily for on-demand treatment (Manco-Johnson, M.J., et al., N. Engl. J. Med.
       357:535-544 (2007)), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Such
       frequent administration is painful and inconvenient.
[00771          The present invention provides a method of administering Factor VIII to a human subject
       in need thereof (e.g., human patient), comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic dose
       of a chimeric Factor VIII polypeptide, e.g., a chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptide, or a hybrid of
       such a polypeptide at a dosing interval at least about one and one-half times longer than the
       dosing interval required for an equivalent dose of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII
       portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., without the Fc portion. The
       present invention is also directed to a method of increasing dosing interval of Factor VIII
       administration in a human subject in need thereof comprising administering the chimeric Factor
       VIII polypeptide.
[0078]          The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half to six times longer, one and
       one-half to five times longer, one and one-half to four times longer, one and one-half to three
       times longer, or one and one-half to two times longer, than the dosing interval required for an
                                                  - 14 -

       equivalent dose of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion (a polypeptide consisting
       of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., without the Fc portion. The dosing interval may be at least
       about one and one-half, two, two and one-half, three, three and one-half, four, four and one-half,
       five, five and one-half or six times longer than the dosing interval required for an equivalent dose
       of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor
       VIII portion), e.g., without the Fc portion. The dosing interval may be about every three, four,
       five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, or fourteen days or longer.
[00791          The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half to 5, one and one-half, 2, 3, 4,
       or 5 days or longer.
[0080]          The present invention also provides a method of administering Factor VIII to a human
       subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic dose of a chimeric
       Factor VIII polypeptide, e.g., a chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptide, or a hybrid of such a
       polypeptide to obtain an area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) at least
       about one and one-quarter times greater than the AUC obtained by an equivalent dose of said
       Factor VIII without non-Factor VIII portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion),
       e.g., without the Fc portion.       The present invention thus includes a method of increasing or
       extending AUC of Factor VIII activity in a human patient in need thereof comprising
       administering the chimeric Factor VIII polypeptide.
[0081]          The present invention also provides a method of administering Factor VIII to a subject in
       need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic dose of a polypeptide
       comprising a Factor VIII and an Fc or a hybrid of such a polypeptide at a dosing interval of about
       every three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, or fourteen days or
       longer.
[0082]          The methods of the invention may be practiced on a subject in need of prophylactic
       treatment or on-demand treatment.
[0083]           "Administering," as used herein, means to give a pharmaceutically acceptable Factor VIII
       polypeptide of the invention to a subject via a pharmaceutically acceptable route.         Routes of
       administration    can be intravenous, e.g.,       intravenous    injection and intravenous  infusion.
       Additional routes of administration include, e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, oral, nasal, and
       pulmonary administration.       Chimeric polypeptides and hybrid proteins may be administered as
       part of a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one excipient.
[0084]           "Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC)," as used herein, is the
       same as the term of art in pharmacology, and is based upon the rate and extent of absorption of
       Factor VIII following administration. AUC is determined over a specified time period, such as
       12, 18, 24, 36, 48, or 72 hours, or for infinity using extrapolation based on the slope of the curve.
       Unless otherwise specified herein, AUC is determined for infinity. The determination of AUC
                                                     - 15 -

       may be carried out in a single subject, or in a population of subjects for which the average is
       calculated.
[00851          A "B domain" of Factor VIII, as used herein, is the same as the B domain known in the
       art that is defined by internal amino acid sequence identity and sites of proteolytic cleavage by
       thrombin, e.g., residues Ser741-Arg1648 of full length human factor VIII.          The other human
       factor VIII domains are defined by the following amino acid residues: Al, residues Alal-Arg372;
       A2, residues Ser373-Arg740; A3, residues Ser1690-Ile2032; Cl, residues Arg2033-Asn2172; C2,
       residues Ser2173-Tyr2332. The A3-C1-C2 sequence includes residues Ser1690-Tyr2332.               The
       remaining sequence, residues Glul649-Argl689, is usually referred to as the factor VIII light
       chain activation peptide. The locations of the boundaries for all of the domains, including the B
       domains, for porcine, mouse and canine factor VIII are also known in the art. In one embodiment,
       the B domain of Factor VIII is deleted ("B domain deleted factor VIII" or "BDD FVIII"). An
       example of a BDD FVIII is REFACTO* (recombinant BDD FVIII), which has the same sequence
       as the Factor VIII portion of the sequence in Table 2A(i) (amino acids I to 1457 or 20 to 1457 of
       SEQ ID NO:2).       In another embodiment, the B domain deleted Factor VIII contains an intact
       intracellular processing site, which corresponds to Arginine at residue 754 of B domain deleted
       Factor VIII, which corresponds to Arginine residue 773 of SEQ ID NO: 2, or residue 1648 of full
       length Factor VIII, which corresponds to Arginine residue 1667 of SEQ ID NO: 6. The sequence
       residue numbers used herein without referring to any SEQ ID Numbers correspond to the Factor
       VIII sequence without the signal peptide sequence (19 amino acids) unless otherwise indicated.
       For example, S743/Q1638 of full-length Factor VIII corresponds to S762/Q1657 of SEQ ID NO:
       6 due to the 19 amino acid signal peptide sequence. In other embodiments, the B domain deleted
       FVIII comprises a substitution or mutation at an amino acid position corresponding to Arginine
       1645, a substitution or mutation at an amino acid position corresponding to Arginine 1648, or a
       substitution or mutation at amino acid positions corresponding to Arginine 1645 and Arginine
       1648 in full-length Factor VIII. In some embodiments, the amino acid substituted at the amino
       acid position corresponding to Arginine 1645 is a different amino acid from the amino acid
       substituted at the amino acid position corresponding to Arginine 1648. In certain embodiments,
       the substitution or mutation is an amino acid other than arginine, e.g., alanine.

       each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, a B
       domain deleted factor VIII sequence of the present invention comprises any one of the deletions
       disclosed at col. 4, line 4 to col. 5, line 28 and examples 1-5 of U.S. Patent No. 6,316,226 (also in
       US 6,346,513).    In some embodiments, a B domain deleted factor VIII of the present invention
                                                     - 16 -

       has a deletion disclosed at col. 2, lines 26-51 and examples 5-8 of U.S. Patent No. 5,789,203 (also
       US 6,060,447, US 5,595,886, and US 6,228,620). In some embodiments, a B domain deleted
       factor VIII has a deletion described in col. 1, lines 25 to col. 2, line 40 of US Patent No.
       5,972,885; col. 6, lines 1-22 and example 1 of U.S. Patent no. 6,048,720; col. 2, lines 17-46 of

       7,041,635; or col. 4, lines 25-53, of U.S. Patent No. 6,458,563.          In some embodiments, a B
       domain deleted factor VIII has a deletion of most of the B domain, but still contains amino
       terminal sequences of the B domain that are essential for in vivo proteolytic processing of the
       primary translation product into two polypeptide chain (i.e., intracellular processing site), as
       disclosed in WO 91/09122, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some
       embodiments, a B domain deleted factor VIII is constructed with a deletion of amino acids 747
       1638, i.e., virtually a complete deletion of the B domain. Hoeben R.C., et al. J. Biol. Chem. 265
       (13): 7318-7323 (1990), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A B domain deleted
       factor VIII may also contain a deletion of amino acids 771-1666 or amino acids 868-1562 of
       factor VIII. Meulien P., et al. Protein Eng. 2(4): 301-6 (1988), incorporated herein by reference
       in its entirety. Additional B domain deletions that are part of the invention include, e.g.,: deletion
       of amino acids 982 through 1562 or 760 through 1639 (Toole et al., Proc. NatL. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.
       83:5939-5942 (1986)), 797 through 1562 (Eaton et al., Biochemistry 25:8343-8347 (1986)), 741
       through 1646 (Kaufmran (PCT published application No. WO 87/04187)), 747-1560 (Sarver et al.,
       DNA 6:553-564 (1987)), 741 through 1648 (Pasek (PCT application No.88/00831)), 816 through
       1598 or 741 through 1689 (Lagner (Behring Inst. Mitt. (1988) No 82:16-25, EP 295597)), each of
       which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Each of the foregoing deletions may be
       made in any Factor VIII sequence.
[00871          In one embodiment, the B domain deleted Factor VIII portion in the chimeric polypeptide
       is processed into two chains connected (or associated) by a metal bond, the first chain comprising
       a heavy chain (Al-A2-partial B) and a second chain comprising a light chain (A3-C1-C2) . In
       another embodiment, the B domain deleted Factor VIII portion is a single chain Factor VIII. The
       single chain Factor VIII can comprise an intracellular processing site, which corresponds to
       Arginine at residue 754 of B domain deleted Factor VIII (residue 773 of SEQ ID NO: 2) or at
       residue 1648 of full-length Factor VIII (residue 1657 of SEQ ID NO: 6).
[0088]          The metal bond between the heavy chain and the light chain can be any metal known in
       the art. For example, the metals useful for the invention can be a divalent metal ion. The metals
       that can be used to associate the heavy chain and light chain include, but not limited to, Ca",

[0089]          "Chimeric polypeptide," as used herein, means a polypeptide that includes within it at
       least two polypeptides (or subsequences         or peptides) from different sources.     Chimeric
       polypeptides may include, e.g., two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more polypeptides from
       different sources, such as different genes, different cDNAs, or different animal or other species.
       Chimeric polypeptides may include, e.g., one or more linkers joining the different subsequences.
       Thus, the subsequences may be joined directly or they may be joined indirectly, via linkers, or
       both, within a single chimeric polypeptide. Chimeric polypeptides may include, e.g., additional
       peptides such as signal sequences and sequences such as 6His and FLAG that aid in protein
       purification or detection.  In addition, chimeric polypeptides may have amino acid or peptide
       additions to the N- and/or C-termini.
[0090]          In some embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide comprises a Factor VIII portion and a
       non-Factor VIII portion. Exemplary non-Factor VIII portions include, e.g., Fc, XTEN, albumin, a
       PAS sequence, transferrin, CTP (28 amino acid C-terminal peptide (CTP) of human chorionic
       gonadotropin (hCG) with its 4 0-glycans), polyethylene glycol (PEG), hydroxyethyl starch
       (HES), albumin binding polypeptide, and albumin-binding small molecules. Exemplary chimeric
       polypeptides of the invention include, e.g., chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptides, chimeric Factor
       VIII-XTEN polypeptides, chimeric Factor VIII-albumin polypeptides, chimeric Factor VIII-PAS
       polypeptides,    chimeric  Factor   VIII-transferrin  polypeptides,  chimeric   Factor  VIII-CTP
       polypeptides, chimeric Factor VIII-PEG polypeptides, chimeric Factor VIII-HES polypeptides,
       chimeric Facotr VIII-albumbin binding polypeptide polypeptides, and chimeric Factor VIII.
       albumin-binding small molecule polypeptides.
[0091]          Exemplary chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptides include, e.g., SEQ ID NO:2 or 6 (Table
       2), with or without their signal sequences and the chimeric Fc polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:4
       (Table 2).
[0092]          The chimeric polypeptide may comprise a sequence at least 90% or 95% identical to the
       Factor VIII and Fc amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(i) without a signal sequence (amino
       acids 20 to 1684 of SEQ ID NO:2) or at least 90% or 95% identical to the Factor VIII and Fc
       amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(i) with a signal sequence (amino acids I to 1684 of SEQ
       ID NO:2), wherein the sequence has Factor VIII activity.         The Factor VIII activity can be
       measured by activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPPT) assay, chromogenic assay, or other
       known methods. The chimeric polypeptide may comprise a sequence identical to the Factor VIII
       and Fc amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(i) without a signal sequence (amino acids 20 to
       1684 of SEQ ID NO:2) or identical to the Factor VIII and Fc amino acid sequence shown in Table
       2A(i) with a signal sequence (amino acids I to 1684 of SEQ ID NO:2).

[00931          As discussed above, exemplary chimeric polypeptides include Factor VIII fused to one or
       more XTEN polypeptides.        Schellenburger et al., Nat. Biotech. 27:1186-90 (2009), which is
       incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The XTEN polypeptide can be fused to either the
       N-terminal end of FVIII or to the C-terminal end of FVIII.      A protease site may be included
       between the XTEN portion and the Factor VIII portion to allow such processing.             XTEN
       polypeptides include, e.g., those disclosed in WO 2009/023270, WO 2010/091122, WO

       one or more albumin polypeptides, albumin binding polypeptides, or albumin-binding small
       molecules. In one embodiment, the albumin is human albumin. The albumin or albumin binding
       protein can be fused to either the N-terminal end of FVIII or to the C-terminal end of FVIII or
       inserted between two amino acids in FVIII. Examples of albumin, e.g., fragments thereof, that
       may be used in the present invention are known. e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,592,010; U.S. Patent No.
       6,686,179; and Schulte, Thrombosis Res. 124 Suppl. 2:S6-S8 (2009), each of which is
       incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[00951          The albumin binding polypeptides can compromise, without limitation, bacterial albumin
       binding domains, albumin-binding peptides, or albumin-binding antibody fragments that can bind
       to albumin. Domain 3 from streptococcal protein G, as disclosed by Kraulis et al., FEBS Lett.
       378:190-194 (1996) and Linhult et al., Protein Sci. 11:206-213 (2002) is an example of a bacterial
       albumin-binding domain. Examples of albumin-binding peptides include a series of peptides
       having the core sequence DICLPRWGCLW (SEQ ID NO: 7). See, e,g., Dennis et al., J. Biol.
       Chem. 2002, 277: 35035-35043 (2002). Examples of albumin-binding antibody fragments are
       disclosed in Muller and Kontermann, Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 9:319-326 (2007); Rooverset et al.,
       Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 56:303-317 (2007), and Holt et al., Prot. Eng. Design Sci.,

[0096]          In certain aspects, a recombinant FVIII polypeptide of the invention comprises at least
       one attachment site for a non-polypeptide small molecule, variant, or derivative that can bind to
       albumin thereof. An example of such albumin binding moieties is 2-(3-maleimidopropanamido)
       6-(4-(4-iodophenyl)butanamido)hexanoate        ("Albu" tag) as  disclosed by Trusselet et al.,
       Bioconjugate Chem. 20:2286-2292 (2009).
[00971          As discussed above, exemplary chimeric polypeptides also include Factor VIII fused to at
       least one   P  subunit of the C-terminal peptide (CTP) of human chorionic gonadotropin or
       fragment, variant, or derivative thereof. The CTP can be fused to Factor VIII either the N
       terminal end of FVIII or to the C-terminal end of FVIII or inserted between two amino acids in
       FVIII. One or more CTP peptides fused to or inserted into a recombinant protein is known to
                                                   - 19  -

        increase the in vivo half-life of that protein. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,712,122, incorporated by
        reference     herein       in     its   entirety.         Exemplary       CTP     peptides      include

        SSSSKAPPPSLPSPSRLPGPSDTPILPQ.                    (SEQ ID NO: 9). See, e.g., U.S. Patent Application
        Publication No. US 2009/0087411 Al, incorporated by reference.
[0098]           As discussed above, exemplary chimeric polypeptides also include Factor VIII fused to at
        least one PAS sequence or fragment, variant, or derivative thereof. The PAS sequence can be
        fused to either the N-terminal end of FVIII or to the C-terminal end of FVIII or inserted between
        two amino acids in FVIII. A PAS peptide or PAS sequence, as used herein, means an amino acid
        sequence comprising mainly alanine and seine residues or comprising mainly alanine, seine, and
        proline residues, the amino acid sequence forming random coil conformation under physiological
        conditions.   Accordingly, the PAS sequence is a building block, an amino acid polymer, or a
        sequence cassette comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of alanine, serine, and
        proline which can be used as a part of the heterologous moiety in the chimeric protein. An amino
        acid polymer also can form random coil conformation when residues other than alanine, serine,
        and proline are added as a minor constituent in the PAS sequence.           By "minor constituent" is
        meant that that amino acids other than alanine, seine,         and proline can be added in the PAS
        sequence to a certain degree, e.g., up to about 12%, i.e., about 12 of 100 amino acids of the PAS
        sequence, up to about 10%, up to about 9%, up to about 8%, about 6%, about 5%, about 4%,
        about 3%, i.e. about 2%, or about 1%, of the amino acids.            The amino acids different from
        alanine, seine and proline cab be selected from the group consisting of Arg, Asn, Asp, Cys, Gln,
        Glu, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp, Tyr, and Val. Under physiological conditions, a
        PAS peptide forms a random coil conformation and thereby can mediate an increased in vivo
        and/or in vitro stability to a recombinant protein of the invention, and has procoagulant activity.
[0099]           Non-limiting examples of the PAS peptides include ASPAAPAPASPAAPAPSAPA
        (SEQ      ID      NO:       10),      AAPASPAPAAPSAPAPAAPS                (SEQ     ID    NO:        11),

[00100]          As discussed above, exemplary chimeric polypeptides also include Factor VIII fused to at
        least one transferrin peptide or fragment, variant, or derivative thereof. At least one transferrin
        peptide can be fused to either the N-terminal end of FVIII or to the C-terminal end of FVIII or
        inserted between two amino acids in FVIII. Any transferrin can be fused to or inserted into a

        recombinant FVIII protein of the invention. As an example, wild-type human Tf (Tf) is a 679
        amino acid protein, of approximately 75 KDa (not accounting for glycosylation), with two main
        domains, N (about 330 amino acids) and C (about 340 amino acids), which appear to originate
        from a gene duplication. See GenBank accession numbers NM001063, XM002793, M12530,
        XM039845, XM 039847 and S95936 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov),                     all of which are herein
        incorporated by reference in their entirety.
[00101]          Transferrin transports iron through transferrin receptor (TfR)-mediated endocytosis.
        After the iron is released into an endosomal compartment and Tf-TfR complex is recycled to cell
        surface, the Tf is released back extracellular space for next cycle of iron transporting.         Tf
        possesses a long half-life that is in excess of 14-17 days (Li et al., Trends Pharmacol.Sci. 23:206
        209 (2002)).Transferrin fusion proteins have been studied for half-life extension, targeted deliver
        for cancer therapies, oral delivery and sustained activation of proinsulin (Brandsma et al.,
        Biotechnol. Adv., 29: 230-238 (2011); Bai et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102:7292-7296

        Release 155:386-392 (2011)).
[00102]          As discussed above, exemplary chimeric polypeptides also include Factor VIII fused to at
        least one polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties.
[00103]          PEGylated FVIII can refer to a conjugate formed between FVIII and at least one
        polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule. PEG is commercially available in a large variety of
        molecular weights and average molecular weight ranges. Typical examples of PEG average
        molecular weight ranges include, but are not limited to, about 200, about 300, about 400, about
        600, about 1000, about 1300-1600, about 1450, about 2000, about 3000, about 3000-3750, about
        3350, about 3000-7000, about 3500-4500, about 5000-7000, about 7000-9000, about 8000, about
        10000, about 8500-11500, about 16000-24000, about 35000, about 40000, about 60000, and
        about 80000 daltons. These average molecular weights are provided merely as examples and are
        not meant to be limiting in any way.
[00104]          A recombinant FVIII protein of the invention can be PEGylated to include mono- or poly
        (e.g., 2-4) PEG moieties. PEGylation can be carried out by any of the PEGylation reactions
        known in the art. Methods for preparing a PEGylated protein product will generally include (i)
        reacting a polypeptide with polyethylene glycol (such as a reactive ester or aldehyde derivative of
        PEG) under conditions whereby the peptide of the invention becomes attached to one or more
        PEG groups; and (ii) obtaining the reaction product(s). In general, the optimal reaction conditions
        for the reactions will be determined case by case based on known parameters and the desired
        result.
[001051          There are a number of PEG attachment methods available to those skilled in the art, for
        example Malik F et al., Exp. Hematol. 20:1028-35 (1992); Francis, Focus on Growth Factors
                                                     - 21 -

        International Pat. Apple. Pub. Nos. W092/16221 and W095/34326. As a non-limiting example,
        FVIII variants can contain cysteine substitutions in one or more insertion sites in FVIII, and the
        cysteines can be further conjugated to PEG polymer. See Mei et al., Blood 116:270-279 (2010)
        and U.S. Patent No. 7,632,921, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
[00106]          As discussed above, exemplary chimeric polypeptides also include Factor VIII fused to at
        least one hydroxyethyl starch (HES) polymer. HES is a derivative of naturally occurring
        amylopectin and is degraded by alpha-amylase in the body.              HES exhibits advantageous
        biological properties and is used as a blood volume replacement agent and in hemodilution
        therapy in the clinics. See, e.g., Sommermeyer et al., Krankenhauspharmazie8:271-278 (1987);
        and Weidler et al., Arzneim. -Forschung/DrugRes. 41: 494-498 (1991).
[001071          HES is mainly characterized by the molecular weight distribution and the degree of
        substitution. HES has a mean molecular weight (weight mean) of from 1 to 300 kD, from 2 to
        200kD, from 3 to 100 kD, or from 4 to 70kD. Hydroxyethyl starch can further exhibit a molar
        degree of substitution of from 0.1 to 3, from 0.1 to 2,from 0.1 to 0.9, or from 0.1 to 0.8, and a
        ratio between C2:C6 substitution in the range of from 2 to 20 with respect to the hydroxyethyl
        groups.    HES with a mean molecular weight of about 130 kD is Voluven* from Fresenius.
        Voluven* is an artificial colloid, employed, e.g., for volume replacement used in the therapeutic
        indication for therapy and prophylaxis of hypovolaemia. There are a number of HES attachment
        methods available to those skilled in the art, e.g., the same PEG attachment methods described
        above.
[00108]          In some embodiments, a chimeric polypeptide comprising a Factor VIII portion has an
        increased half-life (tl/2) over a polypeptide consisting of the same Factor VIII portion without the
        non Factor VIII portion.     A chimeric Factor VIII polypeptide with an increased tl/2 may be
        referred to herein as a long-acting Factor VIII. Long-acting chimeric Factor VIII polypeptides
        include, e.g., Factor VIII fused to Fc (including, e.g., chimeric Factor VIII polypeptides in the
        form of a hybrid such as a FVIIIFc monomer dimer hybrid; see Example 1, Fig. 1, and Table 2A;
        and US Patent Nos. 7,404,956 and 7,348,004), Factor VIII fused to XTEN, and Factor VIII fused
        to albumin.
[00109]          "Culture," "to culture" and "culturing," as used herein, means to incubate cells under in
        vitro conditions that allow for cell growth or division or to maintain cells in a living state.
        "Cultured cells," as used herein, means cells that are propagated in vitro.
[00110]          "Factor VIII," as used herein, means functional factor VIII polypeptide in its normal role
        in coagulation, unless otherwise specified.        Thus, the term Factor VIII includes variant
        polypeptides that are functional.    Factor VIII proteins can be the human, porcine, canine, and
        murine factor VIII proteins.       As described in the Background Art section, the full length

        polypeptide and polynucleotide sequences are known, as are many functional fragments, mutants
        and modified versions. Examples of human factor VIII sequences are shown as subsequences in
        SEQ ID NOs:2 or 6 (Table 2). Factor VIII polypeptides include, e.g., full-length factor VIII, full
        length factor VIII minus Met at the N-terminus, mature factor VIII (minus the signal sequence),
        mature factor VIII with an additional Met at the N-terminus, and/or factor VIII with a full or
        partial deletion of the B domain. Factor VIII variants include B domain deletions, whether partial
        or full deletions.
[00111]          A great many functional factor VIII variants are known, as is discussed above and below.
        In addition, hundreds of nonfunctional mutations in factor VIII have been identified in hemophilia
        patients, and it has been determined that the effect of these mutations on factor VIII function is
        due more to where they lie within the 3-dimensional structure of factor VIII than on the nature of
        the substitution (Cutler et al., Hum. Mutat. 19:274-8 (2002)), incorporated herein by reference in
        its entirety. In addition, comparisons between factor VIII from humans and other species have
        identified conserved residues that are likely to be required for function (Cameron et al., Thromb.
        Haemost. 79:317-22 (1998); US 6,251,632), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[00112]          The human factor VIII gene was isolated and expressed in mammalian cells (Toole, J. J.,
        et al., Nature 312:342-347 (1984); Gitschier, J., et al., Nature 312:326-330 (1984); Wood, W. I.,

        herein by reference in its entirety, and the amino acid sequence was deduced from cDNA. Capon
        et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,199, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discloses a
        recombinant DNA method for producing factor VIII in mammalian host cells and purification of
        human factor VIII. Human factor VIII expression in CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells and
        BHKC (baby hamster kidney cells) has been reported. Human factor VIII has been modified to
        delete part or all of the B domain (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,994,371 and 4,868,112, each of which is
        incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), and replacement of the human factor VIII B
        domain with the human factor V B domain has been performed (U.S. Pat. No. 5,004,803,

        bound by the FcRn receptor with consequent active transport by the FcRn receptor of the FcRn
        binding partner.    Thus, the term Fc includes any variants of IgG Fc that are functional.     The
        region of the Fc portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn receptor has been described based on X-ray
        crystallography (Burmeister et al. , Nature 372:379 (1994), incorporated herein by reference in its
        entirety). The major contact area of the Fc with the FcRn is near the junction of the CH2 and
        CH3 domains. Fc-FcRn contacts are all within a single Ig heavy chain.           The FcRn binding
        partners include, e.g., whole IgG, the Fc fragment of IgG, and other fragments of IgG that include
        the complete binding region of FcRn. The major contact sites include amino acid residues 248,
        250-257, 272, 285, 288, 290-291, 308-311, and 314 of the CH2 domain and amino acid residues
        385-387, 428, and 433-436 of the CH3 domain. References made to amino acid numbering of
        immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, or regions, are all based on Kabat et al. 1991,
        Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U. S. Department of Public Health, Bethesda;

        several mammalian species including humans. The sequences of the human FcRn, rat FcRn, and
        mouse FcRn are known (Story et al., J. Exp. Med. 180: 2377 (1994), incorporated herein by

        with or without the hinge region of the immunoglobulin. Exemplary Fc variants are provided in

[001221          Fc (or Fc portion of a chimeric polypeptide) may also include, e.g., the following
        mutations: The Fc region of IgG can be modified according to well recognized procedures such as
        site directed mutagenesis and the like to yield modified IgG or Fc fragments or portions thereof
        that will be bound by FcRn. Such modifications include, e.g., modifications remote from the
        FcRn contact sites as well as modifications within the contact sites that preserve or even enhance
        binding to the FcRn. For example the following single amino acid residues in human IgGi Fc
        (Fcyl) can be substituted without significant loss of Fc binding affinity for FcRn: P238A, S239A,

        Q418A, Q419A, N421A, V422A, S424A, E430A, N434A, T437A, Q438A, K439A, S440A,
        S444A, and K447A, where for example P238A represents wildtype proline substituted by alanine
        at position number 238. In addition to alanine other amino acids may be substituted for the
        wildtype amino acids at the positions specified above. Mutations may be introduced singly into Fc
        giving rise to more than one hundred FcRn binding partners distinct from native Fc. Additionally,
        combinations of two, three, or more of these individual mutations may be introduced together,
        giving rise to hundreds more FcRn binding partners. Certain of these mutations may confer new
        functionality upon the FcRn binding partner. For example, one embodiment incorporates N297A,
        removing a highly conserved N-glycosylation site. The effect of this mutation is to reduce
        immunogenicity, thereby enhancing circulating half-life of the FcRn binding partner, and to
        render the FcRn binding partner incapable of binding to FcyRI, FcyRIIA, FcyRIIB, and
        FcyRIIIA, without compromising affinity for FcRn (Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation
        60:847, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; Friend et al. 1999,
        Transplantation 68:1632, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; Shields et al.
        1995, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).
        Additionally, at least three human Fc gamma receptors appear to recognize a binding site on IgG
        within the lower hinge region, generally amino acids 234-237. Therefore, another example of new
        functionality and potential decreased immunogenicity may arise from mutations of this region, as
        for example by replacing amino acids 233-236 of human IgGi "ELLG" to the corresponding
        sequence from IgG2 "PVA" (with one amino acid deletion). It has been shown that FcyRI,
        FcyRII, and FcyRIII which mediate various effector functions will not bind to IgGi when such
                                                  - 26  -

        mutations have been introduced (Ward and Ghetie, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77 (1995), which
        is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; and Armour et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613
        (1999), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). As a further example of new
        functionality arising from mutations described above affinity for FcRn may be increased beyond
        that of wild type in some instances. This increased affinity may reflect an increased "on" rate, a
        decreased "off' rate or both an increased "on" rate and a decreased "off' rate. Mutations believed
        to impart an increased affinity for FcRn include, e.g., T256A, T307A, E380A, and N434A
        (Shields et al. , J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591 (2001), which is incorporated herein by reference in its
        entirety).
[00123]          The Fc (or Fc portion of a chimeric polypeptide) may be at least 90% or 95% identical to
        the Fc amino acid sequence shown in Table 2 (amino acids 1458 to 1684 of SEQ ID NO:2 or
        amino acids 2352 to 2578 of SEQ ID NO:6). The Fc (or Fc portion of a chimeric polypeptide)
        may be identical to the Fc amino acid sequence shown in Table 2 (amino acids 1458 to 1684 of
        SEQ ID NO:2 and amino acids 2352 to 2578 of SEQ ID NO:6).
[00124]           "Hybrid" polypeptides and proteins, as used herein, means a combination of a chimeric
        polypeptide with a second polypeptide. The chimeric polypeptide and the second polypeptide in a
        hybrid may be associated with each other via protein-protein interactions, such as charge-charge
        or hydrophobic interactions. The chimeric polypeptide and the second polypeptide in a hybrid
        may be associated with each other via disulfide or other covalent bond(s). Hybrids are described
        in WO 2004/101740 and WO 2006/074199, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in
        its entirety. See also U.S. Patent Nos. 7,404,956 and 7,348,004, each of which is incorporated
        herein by reference in its entirety. The second polypeptide may be a second copy of the same
        chimeric polypeptide or it may be a non-identical chimeric polypeptide.        See, e.g., Figure 1,
        Example 1, and Table 2. In one embodiment, the second polypeptide is a polypeptide comprising
        an Fc. In another embodiment, the chimeric polypeptide is a chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptide
        and the second polypeptide consists essentially of Fc, e.g., the hybrid polypeptide of Example 1,
        which is a rFVIIIFc recombinant fusion protein consisting of a single molecule of recombinant B
        domain deleted human FVIII (BDD-rFVIII) fused to the dimeric Fc domain of the human IgGi,
        with no intervening linker sequence. This hybrid polypeptide is referred to herein as FVIIIFc
        monomeric Fc fusion protein, FVIIIFc monomer hybrid, monomeric FVIIIIFc hybrid, and
        FVIIIFc monomer-dimer.         See Example 1, Fig. 1, and Table 2A.        The Examples provide
        preclinical and clinical data for this hybrid polypeptide.
[001251          The second polypeptide in a hybrid may comprise or consist essentially of a sequence at
        least 90% or 95% identical to the amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(ii) without a signal
        sequence (amino acids 21 to 247 of SEQ ID NO:4) or at least 90% or 95% identical to the amino
        acid sequence shown in Table 2A(ii) with a signal sequence (amino acids 1 to 247 of SEQ ID
                                                     - 27 -

        NO-:4). The second polypeptide may comprise or consist essentially of a sequence identical to
        the amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(ii) without a signal sequence (amino acids 21 to 247
        of SEQ ID NO:4) or identical to the amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(ii) with a signal
        sequence (amino acids 1 to 247 of SEQ ID NO:4).
[00126]          Figure 1 is a schematic showing the structure of a B domain deleted factor VIII-Fc
        chimeric polypeptide, and its association with a second polypeptide that is an Fc polypeptide. To
        obtain this hybrid, the coding sequence of human recombinant B-domain deleted FVIII was
        obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from human liver poly A
        RNA (Clontech) using FVIII-specific primers.         The FVIII sequence includes the native signal
        sequence for FVIII. The B-domain deletion was from serine 743 (S743; 2287 bp) to glutamine
        1638 (Q1638; 4969 bp) for a total deletion of 2682 bp. Then, the coding sequence for human
        recombinant Fc was obtained by RT-PCR from a human leukocyte cDNA library (Clontech)
        using Fc specific primers. Primers were designed such that the B-domain deleted FVIII sequence
        was fused directly to the N-terminus of the Fc sequence with no intervening linker. The FVIIIFc
        DNA sequence was cloned into the mammalian dual expression vector pBUDCE4.1 (Invitrogen)
        under control of the CMV promoter. A second identical Fc sequence including the mouse Igk
        signal sequence was obtained by RT-PCR and cloned downstream of the second promoter, EFla,
        in the expression vector pBUDCE4. 1.
[001271          The rFVIIIFc expression vector was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells
        (HEK293H; Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen).            Stable
        clonal cell lines were generated by selection with Zeocin (Invitrogen). One clonal cell line, 3C4
        22 was used to generate FVIIIFc for characterization in vivo.           Recombinant FVIIIFc was
        produced and purified (McCue et al. 2009) at Biogen Idec (Cambridge, MA). The transfection
        strategy described above was expected to yield three products, i.e., monomeric rFVIIIFc hybrids,
        dimeric rFVIIIFc hybrids and dimeric Fc. However, there was essentially no dimeric rFVIIIFc
        detected in the conditioned medium from these cells. Rather, the conditioned medium contained
        Fc and monomeric rFVIIIFc. It is possible that the size of dimeric rFVIIIFc was too great and
        prevented efficient secretion from the cell.      This result was beneficial since it rendered the
        purification of the monomer less complicated than if all three proteins had been present. The
        material used in these studies had a specific activity of approximately 9000 IU/mg.
[00128]          In one embodiment, the polypeptides of the invention are administered to a patient who
        expresses high level of von Willebrand factor (VWF).          "Subject" or "patient" as used herein
        means a human individual. A subject can be a patient who is currently suffering from a bleeding
        disorder or is expected to be in need of such a treatment. "Subject" can include an adult or a
        pediatric subject. The pediatric subject can be a pediatric patient under the age of 12. The term
        "pediatrics" as used herein is the branch of medicine that deals with the care of infants and
                                                    -28-

        children and the treatment of their diseases. In one embodiment, the subject is a pediatric patient
        who has a diagnosis of severe hemophilia A. In certain embodiments, pediatric subjects are
        treated with a long-acting Factor VIII polypeptide of the invention.
[00129]           VWF is a plasma protein having a multimer structure in which the molecular weight of
        the various forms varies between approximately 230 kDa for each monomer subunit and up to
        more than 20 million Da in the multimer forms of greater molecular weight, thus forming the
        largest known soluble protein. Its plasma concentration is approximately around 5-10 gg/ml
        (Siedlecki et al., Blood, vol 88: 2939-2950 (1996)) and the plasma form of smaller size is that
        corresponding to the dimer, with an approximate size of 500 kDa.
[00130]           VWF has an essential role to play in primary haemostasis, being responsible for the
        adhesion of platelets to damaged vascular surfaces and therefore formation of the platelet plug on
        which the mechanisms for formation of the fibrin coagulate develop. It is suggested that the
        higher molecular weight multimers support platelet adhesion mechanisms to the sub-endothelium
        with greater efficiency and the clinical efficacy of VWF concentrates has been related to the
        concentration of these multimers of higher molecular weight (Metzner et al., Haemophilia 4:25
        32 (1998).
[001311           Therefore, subjects expressing high levels of VWF would require less frequent dosing of
        FVIII compared to a subject who expresses lower or normal levels of VWF. The average range of
        VWF in plasma is between about 50 IU/dL and about 200 IU/dL. In one embodiment, the
        average level of VWF in plasma is about 50 IU/dL.            In another embodiment, a VWF level in
        plasma of at least about 100 IU/dL is considered a high VWF level. In another embodiment, a
        high level of VWF in plasma is between about 100 IU/dL and about 200 IU/dL. In another
        embodiment a high level of VWF in plasma is at least about 110 IU/dL, about 120 IU/dL, about
        130 IU/dL, about 140 IU/dL, about 150 IU/dL, about 160 IU/dL, about 170 IU/dL, about 180
        IU/dL, about 190 IU/dL, or about 200 IU/dL.
[00132]           Therefore, in one embodiment, subjects expressing at least about 100 IU/dL of plasma
        VWF are administered a long-acting FVIII polypeptide of the invention at a long interval dosing
        regimen. In one embodiment, the long-acting FVIII polypeptide is administered at a dosing
        interval of at least about 3 days. In another embodiment, the long-acting FVIII polypeptide is
        administered at a dosing interval of at least about once every week, about once every two weeks,
        about once every 15 days, about once every 20 days, about once every three weeks, about once
        every 25 days, about once every four weeks, or about once every one month.
[00133]           In one embodiment, the subjects were previously identified as having high levels of
        VWF. In certain embodiments, subjects having a blood serotype other than 0 (i.e., A, B, or AB)
        require less frequent dosing of long-acting FVIII because the long-acting FVIII has a longer half
        life in these subjects. In these subjects, the increased half-life is due to their elevated VWF levels.
                                                      - 29 -

[001341          Moreover, pharmacokinetic data, defined as the study of the time course of drug
        absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, can be used as an identifier of subjects
        eligible for longer or shorter dosing intervals using a long-acting FVIII polypeptide of the
        invention. Cinical pharmacokinetics is the application of pharmacokinetic principles to the safe
        and effective therapeutic management of drugs in an individual patient. The primary goals of
        clinical pharmacokinetics include enhancing efficacy and decreasing toxicity of a patient's drug
        therapy.    The development of strong correlations between drug concentrations and their
        pharmacologic responses has enabled clinicians to apply pharmacokinetic principles to actual
        patient situations.
[001351          Thus, in one embodiment, the half-life of a FVIII-Fc polypeptide of the invention is used
        to identify patients who express high levels of VWF. The range of half-life of FVIII-Fc is
        between about 10 and about 40 hours, depending at least in part on the levels of VWF also
        present. On average however, the half-life of FVIII-Fc is about 18 hours. Generally, FVIII-Fc
        exhibits an increased half-life of at least about 1.2-fold in patients having high levels of VWF
        compared to the half-life of FVIII-Fc when administered to individuals having average levels of
        VWF. In one embodiment, FVIII-Fc exhibits an increased half-life of at least about 1.3, 1.4, 1.5,
        1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, or 2.5-fold compared to the half-life of FVIII-Fc when
        administered to individuals having average levels of VWF. In one embodiment, in subjects
        expressing high levels of VWF, the half-life of FVIII-Fc is between at least about 20 hours and
        about 40 hours. In another embodiment, the half-life of FVIII-Fc is at least about 21 hours, 22
        hours, 23 hours, 24 hours, 25 hours, 26 hours, 27 hours, 28 hours, 29 hours, 30 hours, 31 hours,
        32 hours, 33 hours, 34 hours, 35 hours, 36 hours, 37 hours, 38 hours, 39 hours, or 40 hours. In
        one embodiment the half-life of FVIII-Fc is between about 20 and about 27 hours in subjects
        having high levels of VWF.         Thus, in one embodiment, an increased half-life of FVIII-Fc
        compared to average values is indicative of a subject that is eligible for a longer dosing interval
        with a long-acting FVIII polypeptide of the invention.
[001361          In another embodiment, the half-life of a short-acting FVIII polypeptide is used to
        identify patients who express high levels of VWF. As used herein, the term "short-acting FVIII"
        refers to a FVIII polypeptide in which no extenders of half-life have been added.             In one
        embodiment, short-acting FVIII polypeptides consist of full-length or B domain-deleted FVIII.
        Examples of short-acting FVIII polypeptides are Advate* and ReFacto*.
[001371          Since the half-life of short-acting FVIII also varies depending at least in part on VWF
        levels, short-acting FVIII polypeptides can also be used to identify patients that are eligible for a
        longer dosing interval of a long-acting FVIII polypeptide of the invention. In one embodiment,
        the short-acting FVIII exhibits an increased half-life of at least about 1.2-fold in individuals
        expressing high levels of VWF compared to the half-life of the short-acting FVIII when
                                                     -30 -

        administered to individuals having average levels of VWF. In another embodiment, the short
        acting FVIII exhibits an increased half-life of at least about 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0,
        2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, or 2.5-fold in individuals expressing high levels of VWF compared to the half
        life of the short-acting FVIII when administered to individuals having average levels of VWF.
        Thus, individuals that demonstrate an increased half-life of at least about 1.2-fold when they are
        administered a short-acting FVIII are eligible for a longer dosing interval with a long-acting FVIII
        polypeptide of the invention.
[00138]            "Dosing interval," as used herein, means the dose of time that elapses between multiple

        invention may be at least about one and one-half times longer than the dosing interval required for
        an equivalent dose of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion, e.g., without the Fc
        portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII). The dosing interval may be at least about

        and the dosing interval is once every 3 days. In a further embodiment, the effective dose of 80
        IU/kg given at a dosing interval of every 3 days is administered to a pediatric subject. In another
        embodiment, the effective dose is 65 IU/kg and the dosing interval is once weekly, or once every
        6-7 days. The doses can be administered repeatedly as long as they are necessary (e.g., at least

[00142]          "Long-acting Factor VIII" is a Factor VIII having an increased half-life (also referred to
        herein as t1/2, t1/2 beta, elimination half-life and HL) over a reference Factor VIII. The increased
        half-life of a long-acting Factor VIII may be due to fusion to one or more non-Factor VIII
        polypeptides such as, e.g., Fc, XTEN, albumin, a PAS sequence, transferrin, CTP (28 amino acid
        C-terminal peptide (CTP) of hCG with its 4 0-glycans), polyethylene glycol (PEG), hydroxyethyl
        starch (HES), albumin binding polypeptide, albumin-binding small molecules, or two or more
        combinations thereof. The increased half-life may be due to one or more modification, such as,
        e.g., pegylation. Exemplary long-acting Factor VIII polypeptides include, e.g., chimeric Factor
        VIII polypeptides comprising Fc, chimeric Factor VIII polypeptides comprising XTEN and
        chimeric Factor VIII polypeptides comprising albumin. Additional exemplary long-acting Factor
        VIII polypeptides include, e.g., pegylated Factor VIII.
[00143]          The "reference" polypeptide, in the case of a long-acting chimeric Factor VIII
        polypeptide, is a polypeptide consisting essentially of the Factor VIII portion of the chimeric
        polypeptide, e.g., the same Factor VIII portion without the Fc portion, without the XTEN portion,
        or without the albumin portion. Likewise, the reference polypeptide in the case of a modified
        Factor VIII is the same Factor VIII without the modification, e.g., a Factor VIII without the
        pegylation.
[00144]          In some embodiments, the long-acting Factor VIII has one or more of the following
        properties when administered to a subject:
        a mean residence time (MRT) (activity) in said subject of about 14-41.3 hours;
        a clearance (CL) (activity) in said subject of about 1.22-5.19 mL/hour/kg or less;
        a tl/2beta (activity) in said subject of about 11-26.4 hours;

        per IU/kg;
        a Vss (activity) in said subject of about 37.7-79.4 mL/kg; and
        an AUC/dose in said subject of about 19.2-81.7 IU*h/dL per IU/kg.

        subject's plasma. The increased level can be sufficient to decrease the incidence of spontaneous
        bleeding or to prevent bleeding, e.g., in the event of an unforeseen injury. During prophylactic
        treatment, the plasma protein level in the subject may not fall below the baseline level for that

[001581          In one embodiment, the prophylaxis regimen is "tailored" to the individual patient, for
        example, by determining PK data for each patient and administering Factor VIII of the invention
        at a dosing interval that maintains a trough level of 1-3% FVIII activity. Adjustments may be
        made when a subject experiences unacceptable bleeding episodes defined as >2 spontaneous
        bleeding episodes over a rolling two-month period. In this case, adjustment will target trough
        levels of 3-5%. In another embodiment, prophylactic treatment results in prevention and control
        of bleeding, sustained control of bleeding, sustained protection from bleeding, and/or sustained
        benefit. Prophylaxis, e.g., sustained protection can be demonstrated by an increased AUC to last
        measured time point (AUC-LAST) and reduced clearance, resulting in increased terminal tl/2
        compared to short acting FVIII. Prophylaxis can be demonstrated by better Cmax, better Tmax,

        results in no spontaneous bleeding episodes within about 24, 36, 48, 72, or 96 hours (e.g., 25, 26,
        27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,

        the last injection). In certain embodiments, prophylaxis results in greater than 30% (e.g., greater
        than 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55,

        annualized bleeding episodes with once weekly dosing (e.g., at 65 IU/kg). "Therapeutic dose," as
        used herein, means a dose that achieves a therapeutic goal, as described herein. The calculation of
        the required dosage of factor VIII is based upon the empirical finding that, on average, 1 IU of
        factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by approximately 2 IU/dL.
        The required dosage is determined using the following formula:
        Required units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (IU/dL or % of normal) x 0.5 (IU/kg
        per IU/dL)
[001591          The therapeutic doses that may be used in the methods of the invention are about 10-100
        IU/kg, more specifically, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, or 90-100
        IU/kg, and more specifically, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95,
        or 100 IU/kg.
[00160]          Additional therapeutic doses that may be used in the methods of the invention are about
        10 to about 150 IU/kg, more specifically, about 100-110, 110-120, 120-130, 130-140, 140-150
        IU/kg, and more specifically, about 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, or 150 IU/kg.
[00161]          "Variant," as used herein, refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide differing from the
        original polynucleotide or polypeptide, but retaining essential properties thereof, e.g., factor VIII
        coagulant activity or Fc (FcRn binding) activity. Generally, variants are overall closely similar,
                                                     - 41 -

        and, in many regions, identical to the original polynucleotide or polypeptide. Variants include,
        e.g., polypeptide and polynucleotide fragments, deletions, insertions, and modified versions of
        original polypeptides.
[00162]          Variant polynucleotides may comprise, or alternatively consist of, a nucleotide sequence
        which is at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to, for example, the
        nucleotide coding sequence in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, or 5 (the factor VIII portion, the Fc portion,
        individually or together) or the complementary strand thereto, the nucleotide coding sequence of
        known mutant and recombinant factor VIII or Fc such as those disclosed in the publications and
        patents cited herein or the complementary strand thereto, a nucleotide sequence encoding the
        polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, or 6 (the factor VIII portion, the Fc portion, individually or
        together), and/or polynucleotide fragments of any of these nucleic acid molecules (e.g., those
        fragments described herein).    Polynucleotides which hybridize to these nucleic acid molecules
        under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency conditions are also included as
        variants, as are polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides as long as they are functional.
[00163]          Variant polypeptides may comprise, or alternatively consist of, an amino acid sequence
        which is at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% identical to, for example, the polypeptide
        sequence shown in SEQ ID NOS:2, 4, or 6 (the factor VIII portion, the Fc portion, individually or
        together), and/or polypeptide fragments of any of these polypeptides (e.g., those fragments
        described herein).
[00164]          By a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence at least, for example, 95% "identical" to a
        reference nucleotide sequence, it is intended that the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid is
        identical to the reference sequence except that the nucleotide sequence may include up to five
        point mutations per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence. In other words, to
        obtain a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence at least 95% identical to a reference nucleotide
        sequence, up to 5% of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted
        with another nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 5% of the total nucleotides in the
        reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. The query sequence may be, for
        example, the entire sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3, the ORF (open reading frame), or any
        fragment specified as described herein.
[001651          As a practical matter, whether any particular nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide is at
              8

                                                        % identical to a nucleotide sequence or polypeptide
        of the present invention can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. In
        one embodiment, a method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence
        (reference or original sequence) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence
        alignment, can be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of
        Brutlag et al., Comp. App. Biosci. 6:237-245 (1990), which is herein incorporated by reference in
                                                   - 42  -

        its entirety In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are both DNA sequences.
        An RNA sequence can be compared by converting U's to T's. The result of said global sequence
        alignment is in percent identity.      In another embodiment, parameters used in a FASTDB
        alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity are:         Matrix=Unitary, k-tuple=4,
        Mismatch Penalty--1, Joining Penalty=30, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=1, Gap
        Penalty--5, Gap Size Penalty 0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject nucleotide
        sequence, whichever is shorter.
[00166]          If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of 5' or 3' deletions,
        not because of internal deletions, a manual correction must be made to the results. This is because
        the FASTDB program does not account for 5' and 3' truncations of the subject sequence when
        calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the 5' or 3' ends, relative to the
        query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of bases of the query
        sequence that are 5' and 3' of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned, as a percent of
        the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a nucleotide is matched/aligned is determined by
        results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent
        identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a
        final percent identity score. This corrected score is what is used for the purposes of the present
        invention. Only bases outside the 5' and 3' bases of the subject sequence, as displayed by the
        FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence, are calculated for
        the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score.
[001671          For example, a 90 base subject sequence is aligned to a 100 base query sequence to
        determine percent identity.     The deletions occur at the 5' end of the subject sequence and
        therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matched/alignment of the first 10 bases at 5'
        end. The 10 unpaired bases represent 10% of the sequence (number of bases at the 5' and 3' ends
        not matched/total number of bases in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent
        identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 bases were perfectly
        matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 base subject sequence
        is compared with a 100 base query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so that
        there are no bases on the 5' or 3' of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the
        query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once
        again, only bases 5' and 3' of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query
        sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are to made for the purposes of
        the present invention.
[00168]          By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example, 95% "identical" to
        a query amino acid sequence of the present invention, it is intended that the amino acid sequence
        of the subject polypeptide is identical to the query sequence except that the subject polypeptide
                                                   - 43 -

        sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the query
        amino acid sequence. In other words, to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at
        least 95% identical to a query amino acid sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the
        subject sequence may be inserted, deleted, (indels) or substituted with another amino acid. These
        alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the
        reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either
        individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within
        the reference sequence.
[00169]           As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide is at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%,
        97%, 98% or 99% identical to, for instance, the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:2 (the factor
        VIII portion, the Fc portion, individually or together) or 4, or a known factor VIII or Fc
        polypeptide sequence, can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. In one
        embodiment, a method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence
        (reference or original sequence) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence
        alignment, can be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of
        Brutlag et al., Comp. App. Biosci. 6:237-245(1990), incorporated herein by reference in its
        entirety.   In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are either both nucleotide
        sequences or both amino acid sequences.         The result of said global sequence alignment is in
        percent identity. In another embodiment, parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment
        are: Matrix=PAM 0, k-tuple=2, Mismatch Penalty=1, Joining Penalty--20, Randomization Group
        Length=0,      Cutoff  Score=1,   Window      Size=sequence   length, Gap      Penalty--5, Gap  Size
        Penalty=0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence, whichever is
        shorter.
[001701           If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N- or C-terminal
        deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction must be made to the results. This
        is because the FASTDB program does not account for N- and C-terminal truncations of the
        subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the
        N- and C-termini, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating
        the number of residues of the query sequence that are N- and C-terminal of the subject sequence,
        which are not matched/aligned with a corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total
        bases of the query sequence. Whether a residue is matched/aligned is determined by results of the
        FASTDB sequence alignment.          This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity,
        calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final
        percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of the
        present invention. Only residues to the N- and C-termini of the subject sequence, which are not
        matched/aligned with the query sequence, are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting
                                                    -  44 -

        the percent identity score. That is, only query residue positions outside the farthest N- and C
        terminal residues of the subject sequence.
[001711          For example, a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue
        query sequence to determine percent identity.       The deletion occurs at the N-terminus of the
        subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching/alignment of
        the first 10 residues at the N-terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10% of the sequence
        (number of residues at the N- and C- termini not matched/total number of residues in the query
        sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB
        program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be
        90%. In another example, a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query
        sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N- or C
        termini of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query. In this case the
        percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected.           Once again, only residue
        positions outside the N- and C-terminal ends of the subject sequence, as             displayed in the
        FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence are manually
        corrected for. No other manual corrections are to made for the purposes of the present invention.
[00172]          The polynucleotide variants may contain alterations in the coding regions, non-coding
        regions, or both.     In one embodiment, the polynucleotide variants contain alterations which
        produce silent substitutions, additions, or deletions, but do not alter the properties or activities of
        the encoded polypeptide.      In another embodiment, nucleotide variants are produced by silent
        substitutions due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. In other embodiments, variants in which
        5-10,   1-5, or 1-2 amino       acids are substituted, deleted, or added in any combination.
        Polynucleotide variants can be produced for a variety of reasons, e.g., to optimize codon
        expression for a particular host (change codons in the human mRNA to others, e.g.,          a bacterial
        host such as E. coli).
[00173]          Naturally occurring variants are called "allelic variants," and refer to one of several
        alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an organism (Genes II,
        Lewin, B., ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York (1985)).        These allelic variants can vary at either
        the polynucleotide     and/or polypeptide level and are included in the present invention.
        Alternatively, non-naturally occurring variants may be produced by mutagenesis techniques or by
        direct synthesis.
[00174]          Using known methods of protein engineering and recombinant DNA technology, variants
        may be generated to improve or alter the characteristics of the polypeptides. For instance, one or
        more amino acids can be deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus of the secreted protein
        without substantial loss of biological function. Ron et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 2984-2988 (1993),
        incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, reported variant KGF proteins having heparin
                                                    - 45 -

        binding activity even after deleting 3, 8, or 27 amino-terminal amino acid residues. Similarly,
        Interferon gamma exhibited up to ten times higher activity after deleting 8-10 amino acid residues
        from the carboxy terminus of this protein.         (Dobeli et al., J. Biotechnology 7:199-216 (1988),
        incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.)
[001751           Moreover, ample evidence demonstrates that variants often retain a biological activity
        similar to that of the naturally occurring protein. For example, Gayle and coworkers (J. Biol.
        Chem 268:22105-22111 (1993), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) conducted
        extensive mutational analysis of human cytokine IL-la.              They used random mutagenesis to
        generate over 3,500 individual IL-la mutants that averaged 2.5 amino acid changes per variant
        over the entire length of the molecule.         Multiple mutations were examined at every possible
        amino acid position. The investigators found that "[m]ost of the molecule could be altered with
        little effect on either [binding or biological activity]."     (See Abstract.) In fact, only 23 unique
        amino acid sequences, out of more than 3,500 nucleotide sequences examined, produced a protein
        that significantly differed in activity from wild-type.
[00176]           As stated above, polypeptide variants include, e.g., modified polypeptides. Modifications
        include, e.g., acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin,
        covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide
        derivative,   covalent attachment      of a lipid or lipid derivative,        covalent attachment    of
        phosphotidylinositol,    cross-linking,    cyclization,   disulfide   bond  formation,   demethylation,
        formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation,
        gamma-carboxylation,       glycosylation,    GPI      anchor   formation,   hydroxylation,  iodination,
        methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, pegylation (Mei et al., Blood 116:270-79 (2010), which is
        incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), proteolytic processing, phosphorylation,
        prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino
        acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination. In some embodiments, Factor VIII is
        modified, e.g., pegylated, at any convenient location.           In some embodiments, Factor VIII is
        pegylated at a surface exposed amino acid of Factor VIII, e.g., a surface exposed cysteine, which
        may be an engineered cysteine.      Id.. In some embodiments, modified Factor VIII, e.g., pegylated
        Factor VIII, is a long-acting Factor VIII.
[001771           "Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss)," as used herein, has the same meaning as
        the term used in pharmacology, which is the apparent space (volume) into which a drug
        distributes. Vss = the amount of drug in the body divided by the plasma concentration at steady
        state.
[00178]           "About," as used herein for a range, modifies both ends of the range. Thus, "about 10-20"
        means "about 10 to about 20."

[001791          The chimeric polypeptide used herein can comprise processed Factor VIII or single chain
        Factor VIII or a combination thereof     "Processed Factor VIII," as used herein means Factor VIII
        that has been cleaved at Arginine 1648 (for full-length Factor VIII) or Arginine 754 (for B
        domain deleted Factor VIII), i.e., intracellular processing site.     Due to the cleavage at the
        intracellular processing site, processed Factor VIII comprises two polypeptide chains, the first
        chain being a heavy chain and the second chain being a light chain. For example, the processed
        Factor VIII-Fc fusion protein (i.e., Heavy chain and Light chain fused to Fc) run at approximately
        90 kDa and 130 kDa on a non-reducing SDS-PAGE, respectively, and 90 kDa and 105 kDa on a
        reducing SDS-PAGE, respectively.       Therefore, in one embodiment, at least about 50%, about
        60%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about 96%, about

        Factor VIII. In a particular embodiment, the chimeric polypeptide comprising processed Factor
        VIII is purified (or isolated) from the chimeric polypeptide comprising single chain Factor VIII,

[00182]          The Factor VIII portion in the chimeric polypeptide used herein has Factor VIII activity.
        Factor VIII activity can be measured by any known methods in the art.          For example, one of
                                                   -48-

        those methods can be a chromogenic assay. The chromogenic assay mechanism is based on the
        principles of the blood coagulation cascade, where activated Factor VIII accelerates the
        conversion of Factor X into Factor Xa in the presence of activated Factor IX, phospholipids and
        calcium ions. The Factor Xa activity is assessed by hydrolysis of a p-nitroanilide (pNA) substrate
        specific to Factor Xa. The initial rate of release of p-nitroaniline measured at 405 nM is directly
        proportional to the Factor Xa activity and thus to the Factor VIII activity in the sample.     The
        chromogenic assay is recommended by the Factor VIII and Factor IX Subcommittee of the
        Scientific and Standardization Committee (SSC) of the International Society on Thrombosis and
        Hemostatsis (ISTH). Since 1994, the chromogenic assay has also been the reference method of
        the European Pharmacopoeia for the assignment of FVIII concentrate potency.           Thus, in one
        embodiment, the chimeric polypeptide comprising single chain Factor VIII has Factor VIII
        activity comparable to a chimeric polypeptide comprising processed Factor VIII (e.g., a chimeric
        polypeptide consisting essentially of or consisting of two Fc portions and processed Factor VIII,
        wherein said processed Factor VIII is fused to one of the two Fc portions), when the Factor VIII
        activity is measured in vitro by a chromogenic assay.
[00183]          In another embodiment, the chimeric polypeptide comprising single chain Factor VIII of
        this invention has a Factor Xa generation rate comparable to a chimeric polypeptide comprising
        processed Factor VIII (e.g., a chimeric polypeptide consisting essentially of or consisting of two
        Fc portions and processed Factor VIII, wherein the processed Factor VIII is fused to one Fc of the
        two Fc portions).
[00184]          In order to activate Factor X to Factor Xa, activated Factor IX (Factor IXa) hydrolyses
        one arginine-isoleucine bond in Factor X to form Factor Xa in the presence of Ca2+, membrane
        phospholipids, and a Factor VIII cofactor. Therefore, the interaction of Factor VIII with Factor
        IX is critical in coagulation pathway.         In certain embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide
        comprising single chain factor VIII can interact with Factor IXa at a rate comparable to a chimeric
        polypeptide comprising processed Factor VIII (e.g., a chimeric polypeptide consisting essentially
        of or consisting of two Fc portions and processed Factor VIII, wherein the processed Factor VIII
        is fused to one Fc of the two Fc portions).
[001851          In addition, Factor VIII is bound to von Willebrand Factor while inactive in circulation.
        Factor VIII degrades rapidly when not bound to vWF and is released from vWF by the action of
        thrombin. In some embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide comprising single chain Factor VIII
        binds to von Willebrand Factor at a level comparable to a chimeric polypeptide comprising
        processed Factor VIII (e.g., a chimeric polypeptide consisting essentially of or consisting of two
        Fc portions and processed Factor VIII, wherein the processed Factor VIII is fused to one Fc of the
        two Fc portions).
                                                    - 49  -

[001861           Factor VIII can be inactivated by activated protein C in the presence of calcium and
        phospholipids. Activated protein C cleaves Factor VIII heavy chain after Arginine 336 in the Al
        domain, which disrupts a Factor X substrate interaction site, and cleaves after Arginine 562 in the
        A2 domain, which enhances the dissociation of the A2 domain as well as disrupts an interaction
        site with the Factor IXa. This cleavage also bisects the A2 domain (43 kDa) and generates A2-N
        (18 kDa) and A2-C (25 kDa) domains. Thus, activated protein C can catalyze multiple cleavage
        sites in the heavy chain. In one embodiment, the chimeric polypeptide comprising single chain
        Factor VIII is inactivated by activated Protein C at a level comparable to a chimeric polypeptide
        comprising processed Factor VIII (e.g., a chimeric polypeptide consisting essentially of or
        consisting of two Fc portions and processed Factor VIII, wherein the processed Factor VIII is
        fused to one Fc of the two Fc portions).
[001871           In other embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide comprising single chain Factor VIII has
        Factor VIII activity in vivo comparable to a chimeric polypeptide comprising processed Factor
        VIII (e.g., a chimeric polypeptide consisting essentially of or consisting of two Fc portions and
        processed Factor VIII, wherein the processed Factor VIII is fused to one Fc of the two Fc
        portions). In a particular embodiment, the chimeric polypeptide comprising single chain Factor
        VIII is capable of protecting a HemA mouse at a level comparable to a chimeric polypeptide
        comprising processed Factor VIII (e.g., a chimeric polypeptide consisting essentially of or
        consisting of two Fc portions and processed Factor VIII, wherein said processed Factor VIII is
        fused to one Fc of the two Fc portions) in a HemA mouse tail vein transection model.
[00188]           The term "comparable" as used herein means a compared rate or level resulted from using
        the chimeric polypeptide is equal to, substantially equal to, or similar to the reference rate or level.
        The term "similar" as used herein means a compared rate or level has a difference of no more than
        10% or no more than 15% from the reference rate or level (e.g., FXa generation rate by a chimeric
        polypeptide consisting essentially of or consisting of two Fc portions and processed Factor VIII,
        wherein said processed Factor VIII is fused to one Fc of the two Fc portions).               The term
        "substantially equal" means a compared rate or level has a difference of no more than 0.01%,
        0.5% or 1% from the reference rate or level.

[00190]          In certain embodiments, the composition of the present invention has Factor VIII activity
        comparable to the composition comprising processed Factor VIII (e.g., a composition comprising

        Factor VIII activity is measured in vitro by a chromogenic assay.
[00191]          In other embodiments, the composition of the invention has a Factor Xa generation rate
        comparable to a composition comprising processed Factor VIII (e.g., a composition comprising a
        chimeric polypeptide, which consists essentially of or consists of two Fc portions and processed

        polypeptide, which consists essentially of or consists of two Fc portions and processed Factor

[00192]          The present invention further provides a method for treating a bleeding condition in a
        human subject using the composition of the invention.            An exemplary method comprises
        administering to the subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical
        composition/formulation comprising a chimeric polypeptide having Factor VIII activity, wherein
        at least about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 85%, about
        90%, about 95%, or about 99% of the chimeric polypeptide comprises a Factor VIII portion,
        which is single chain Factor VIII, and a second portion.
[00193]          The bleeding condition can be caused by a blood coagulation disorder.            A blood
        coagulation disorder can also be referred to as a coagulopathy.          In one example, the blood
        coagulation disorder, which can be treated with a pharmaceutical composition of the current
        disclosure, is hemophilia or von Willebrand disease (vWD).          In another example, the blood
        coagulation disorder, which can be treated with a pharmaceutical composition of the present
        disclosure is hemophilia A.
[00194]          In some embodiments, the type of bleeding associated with the bleeding condition is
        selected from hemarthrosis, muscle bleed, oral bleed, hemorrhage, hemorrhage into muscles, oral
        hemorrhage, trauma, trauma capitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, intra
        abdominal hemorrhage, intrathoracic hemorrhage, bone fracture, central nervous system bleeding,
        bleeding in the retropharyngeal space, bleeding in the retroperitoneal space, and bleeding in the
        illiopsoas sheath.

[001951           In other embodiments, the subject suffering from bleeding condition is in need of
        treatment for surgery, including, e.g., surgical prophylaxis or peri-operative management. In one
        example, the surgery is selected from minor surgery and major surgery. Exemplary surgical
        procedures     include tooth extraction, tonsillectomy,         inguinal herniotomy, synovectomy,
        craniotomy, osteosynthesis, trauma surgery, intracranial surgery, intra-abdominal surgery,
        intrathoracic surgery, joint replacement surgery (e.g., total knee replacement, hip replacement,
        and the like), heart surgery, and caesarean section.
[00196]           In another example, the subject is concomitantly treated with FIX.               Because the
        compounds of the invention are capable of activating FIXa, they could be used to pre-activate the
        FIXa polypeptide before administration of the FIXa to the subject.
[001971           The methods of the invention may be practiced on a subject in need of prophylactic
        treatment or on-demand treatment.
[00198]           The pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least 30% of single chain Factor VIII
        may be formulated for any appropriate manner of administration, including, for example, topical
        (e.g., transdermal or ocular), oral, buccal, nasal, vaginal, rectal or parenteral administration.
[00199]           The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intradermal, intravascular (e.g.,
        intravenous), intramuscular, spinal, intracranial, intrathecal, intraocular, periocular, intraorbital,
        intrasynovial and intraperitoneal injection, as well as any similar injection or infusion
        techniqueThe composition can be also for example a suspension, emulsion, sustained release
        formulation, cream, gel or powder. The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with
        traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides.
[00200]           In one example, the pharmaceutical formulation is a liquid formulation, e.g., a buffered,
        isotonic, aqueous solution. In another example, the pharmaceutical composition has a pH that is
        physiologic, or close to physiologic.          In other examples, the aqueous formulation has a
        physiologic or close to physiologic osmolarity and salinity. It can contain sodium chloride and/or
        sodium acetate. In some examples, the composition of the present invention is lyophilized.

        understood by reference to the following examples, which are included herewith for purposes of

        Cloning, expression and purification of rFVIIFc
[00202]          All molecular biology procedures were performed following standard techniques. The
        coding sequence of human FVIII (Genbank accession number NM_000132), including its native
        signal sequence, was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR)
        from human liver polyA RNA. Due to the large size of FVIII, the coding sequence was obtained
        in several sections from separate RT-PCR reactions, and assembled through a series of PCR
        reactions, restriction digests and ligations into an intermediate cloning vector containing a B
        domain deleted (BDD) FVIII coding region with a fusion of seine 743 (S743) to glutamine 1638
        (Q1638), eliminating 2682 bp from the B domain of full length FVIII.          The human IgG1 Fc
        sequence (e.g., GenBank accession number Y14735) was obtained by PCR from a leukocyte
        cDNA library, and the final expression cassette was made in such a way that the BDD FVIII
        sequence was fused directly to the N-terminus of the Fc sequence (hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains,
        beginning at D221 of the IgG1 sequence, EU numbering) with no intervening linker.               For
        expression of the Fc chain alone, the mouse Ig (kappa) light chain signal sequence was created
        with synthetic oligonucleotides and added to the Fc coding sequence using PCR to enable
        secretion of this protein product. The FVIIIFc and Fc chain coding sequences were cloned into a
        dual expression vector, pBudCE4.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
[00203]          HEK 293H cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were transfected with the pSYN-FVIII-013
        plasmid using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)), and a stable cell
        line was selected with zeocin. Cells were grown in serum free suspension culture, and rFVIIIFc
        protein purified from clarified harvest media using a four column purification process, including a
        FVIII-specific affinity purification step (McCue J. et al., J. Chromatogr.A., 1216(45): 7824-30
        (2009)), followed by a combination of anion exchange columns and a hydrophobic interaction
        column.
                                                 Example 2
        Biochemical characterization
[00204]          Processed recombinant FVIII-Fc (rFVIIIFc) is synthesized as two polypeptide chains, one
        chain consisting of BDD-FVIII (S743-Q1638 fusion, 1438 amino acids) fused to the Fc domain
        (hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains) of IgG1 (226 amino acids, extending from D221 to G456, EU
        numbering), for a total chain length of 1664 amino acids, the other chain consisting of the same
                                                   - 54 -

        Fc region alone (226 amino acids). Though cells transfected with the FVIIIFc/Fc dual expression
        plasmid were expected to secrete three products (FVIIIFc dimer, FVIIIFc monomer, and Fc
        dimer), only the FVIIIFc monomer and Fc dimer were detected in conditioned media. Purified
        FVIIIFc was analyzed by non-reducing and reducing SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 2A and, B).
        For the nonreduced SDS-PAGE, bands were found migrating at approximately 90 kDa and 130
        kDa, consistent with the predicted molecular weights of the FVIIIFc heavy chain (HC) and light
        chain-dimeric Fc fusion (LCFc2) (Figure 2A, lane 3).          A third band was also detected at
        approximately 220 kDa, consistent with the predicted molecular weight for single chain FVIIIFc
        (SC FVIIIFc; HC+LCFc2), in which the arginine residue at position 754 (1648 with respect to the
        full length sequence) is not cleaved during secretion. For the reduced SDS-PAGE analysis, major
        bands were seen migrating at approximately 25 kDa, 90 kDa, 105 kDa, and 195 kDa, consistent
        with the predicted molecular weights for the single chain Fc, HC, LCFc, and SC FVIIIFc (Figure
        2B, lane 3).      Cotransfection with human PC5, a member of the proprotein convertase
        subtlisin/kexin (PCSK) type proteases, resulted in full processing of the rFVIIIFc product (Figure
        2A, B, lane 2).
[002051          Densitometry analysis of several batches of rFVIIIFc after SDS-PAGE indicated greater
        than 98% purity of the expected bands. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was also used to
        assess the degree of aggregation present, and all batches were found to have aggregate levels at
        0.5% or less.
[00206]          rFVIIIFc structure was further analyzed by thrombin cleavage, reduction, and analysis by
        LC/UV and LC/MS.        The four Factor VIII fragments generated by thrombin (by cleavages at
        three arginine residues, at positions 372, 740 and 795 (795 corresponds to 1689 with respect to the
        full length FVIII sequence), can be detected by UV absorbance (Figure 2C), corresponding to the
        following segments of the protein: Fc (peak 1), light-chain-Fc (peak 2); the Al domain from the
        heavy chain (peak 3) and the A2 domain from the heavy chain (peak 4). The 14 amino acid B
        domain linker and ~ 6 kDa a3-related peptides are not detected by UV absorbance due to their
        small size.
[002071          Analysis of the thrombin digestion of rFVIIIFc by HPLC/MS provided further detailed
        information of the four main domains as well as the ~6 kDa a3 related peptides, and was
        compared to REFACTO@, a CHO-derived recombinant BDD-FVIII protein (rBDD FVIII), using
        the same methods.      FVIII samples were passed through Detergent-OUTDTG-100X columns
        (GBioscience, Maryland Heights, MO) for the removal of Tween, fully digested with thrombin,
        reduced and analyzed either by RP-HPLC-UV (POROS Ri/10, Applied Biosystems) or RP
        HPLC-MS (Agilent 1200 coupled to an Agilent 6210TOF mass spectrometer) using gradients of
        acetonitrile in water + 0.1% formic acid . Peptide sequence was also confirmed with LysC
        peptide mapping, analyzed by RP-HPLC/MS (Thermo Finnigan LTQ-XL-ETD).
                                                    - 55 -

[002081          As expected, the total ion current (TIC) chromatogram of rFVIIIFc (Figure 2D) appears
        similar to the UV chromatogram (Figure 2C). Five of the expected six products can be detected
        by LC/MS, including two forms of the a3 acidic region generated from the processed and single
        chain isoforms, as well as the thrombin used for the digestion. An additional truncated form of
        the a3 acidic region was also observed, and is described more fully below. rBDD FVIII yielded a
        similar TIC chromatogram, but without the free Fc chain and having a different mass for the LC
        compared to the rFVIIIFc LC-Fc, consistent with the lack of an Fc region (data not shown).
[00209]          Due to the heterogeneity of glycosylation over much of the protein, the deconvoluted
        mass spectra for the Al, LC-Fc, and Fc regions are complex and therefore the identity of all of the
        molecular ions have not been established. However, the observed mass for the three major peaks
        from the Fc region were found to match the GO, Gi, and G2 isoforms found on IgG molecules,
        corresponding to biantennary oligosaccharides terminating in 0, 1 or 2 galactose residues. The
        deconvoluted mass spectra of the a3-related peptides and the A2 domain provide the most
        definitive data, as there are no heterogeneity in the posttranslational modifications in these
        regions, allowing the expected masses to be identified unambiguously.
[00210]          The 6 kDa N-terminal peptide released from the LC after cleavage of R1689 is predicted
        to comprise the a3 acidic region (amino acids E1649 to R1689) if derived from the processed
        isoform, and the 14 amino acid truncated B domain fused to the a3 acidic region if derived from
        the single chain isoform. Both rFVIIIFc and rBDD FVIII were found to contain both forms of the
        a3 region, proportional to the expected levels based on SDS-PAGE analysis. In addition, both
        proteins contained a truncated form of the a3 region corresponding to amino acids D1658-R1689,
        as has been reported for other FVIII products, though this was found in greater abundance in
        rBDD FVIII than in rFVIIIFc.
[00211]          The A2 domain contains three potential tyrosine sulfation sites, but no glycosylation sites
        that could result in complex heterogeneity, and therefore the exact masses of this region can be
        calculated.   In addition to the primary expected peak in the deconvoluted mass spectrum of
        rFVIIIFc correlating to the mass of the S373 to R740 sequence (Figure 2E), two additional forms
        were identified corresponding to known truncations of the FVIII HC, correlating with an A2
        domain truncated at E720 and Y729. These reported truncated forms were also observed directly
        in the deconvoluted spectrum of rBDD FVIII A2 (Figure 2E). Both rFVIIIFc and rBDD FVIII
        A2 contained similar relative amounts of the form truncated at Y729 while the rBDD FVIII A2
        domain contained a notably greater level of the form truncated at E720 as compared to the same
        form in rFVIIIFc (Figure 2E).
[00212]          The primary sequence of rFVIIIFc was confirmed by peptide mapping with lysyl
        endopeptidase (Lys-C) digests followed by UV and mass spectrometric detection.           Of the 99
        theoretical peptides produced from rFVIIIFc, 81 were detected, corresponding to 98% of the total
                                                   - 56 -

        sequence.     The posttranslational modifications of rFVIIIFc were also characterized by this
        method. FVIII contains 6 potential tyrosine sulfation sites, corresponding to positions 346, 718,
        719, 723, 1664, and 1680. Fully sulfated peptides corresponding to these six sites were found,
        with trace amounts of non-sulfated peptide corresponding to position 1680 as assessed by
        integration of the total ion chromatogram in the mass spectra, and no detectable non-sulfated
        peptides corresponding to the other positions.         BDD FVIII also contains 6 potential N
        glycosylation sites, four of which have been reported to be glycosylated in recombinant FVIII
        products. Consistent with this, rFVIIIFc was found to have the same 4 sites glycosylated; N239
        and N2118 were found to contain high mannose structures, while N41 and N1810 were found to
        contain more complex carbohydrates, similar to those found on rBDD FVIII. The Fc region N
        linked glycosylation was found to match the GO, Gi, and G2 isoforms found with the thrombin
        map by LC/MS. FVIII has been reported to have 0-glycosylation sites at Ser 741 and 743 that
        are partially occupied, and this was found to be the case with rFVIIIFc as well.
[002131          The rFVIIIFc polypeptide produced without cotransfected processing enzymes exhibited
        15-25% single chain FVIIIFc (SC FVIIIFc), which differs from processed rFVIIIFc by a single
        peptide bond between R754 and E755 (R1648/E1649 with respect to the full length FVIII). This
        isoform was purified and characterized in all of the biochemical assays described above, and
        found to be comparable to rFVIIIFc as shown below.           The activity of purified single chain
        FVIIIFc was found to be similar to rFVIIIFc in a chromogenic assay as well as by the various
        functional assays described below.
        Measurement of FVIII Activity by Chromogenic and One-Stage aPTT Assays
[00214]          FVIII activity was measured by a FVIII chromogenic assay. The average specific activity
        from four separate batches of rFVIIIFc was found to be 9762 ± 449 IU/mg by the chromogenic
        assay, corresponding to 2148+99 IU/nmol. The average specific activity from fourteen separate
        batches of rFVIIIFc was found to be 8460 ± 699 IU/mg by the aPTT assay, and 9348 ± 1353
        IU/mg by the chromogenic          assay, corresponding to 1861+154       and 2057+298     IU/nmol,
        respectively.   FVIII activity of single chain FVIII:Fc was also measured by the chromogenic
        assay and compared to the completely processed rFVIII:Fc or rFVIII:Fc DS (containing about
        25% single chain rFVIII:Fc). As Table 3A shows, single chain rFVIIIFc showed no significant
        difference in FVIII activity compared to the Factor VIII activity of completely processed FVIIIFc
        or rFVIIIFc DS by the chromogenic assay, both in the presence and the absence of von
        Willebrand Factor (VWF). Table 3B shows that full activity of SCrFVIIIFc, as measured by one
        stage activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay, was observed in the absence of VWF.

                VWF
[00215]           In one-stage clotting assay (APTT), SC rFVIIIFc demonstrated a 60% decrease in activity
        when the plasma has normal VWF level, suggesting the potential role of VWF in the activation of
        SC rFVIIIFc. This observation was further confirmed by addition of human VWF back to the
        FVIII/VWF-depleted plasma (Table 3), where the coagulant activity of SC rFVIIIFc was reduced
        to the same level as in congenital FVIII-deficient plasma.
        Activity in Xase Complex
[00216]           FVIII activity was also measured in the context of the Xase complex, by incubating
        activated FIX and thrombin-activated REFACTO@ or rFVIIIFc protein on a phospholipid surface
        in the presence of calcium, and monitoring the conversion of FX to FXa as measured by cleavage
        of a chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate, from which FXa generation rates were determined.
        This assay was then modified by varying one component of the assay while keeping the others
        constant in order to examine the interactions with each individual component.
[002171           The FXa generation rate was determined as a function of varying phospholipid
        concentrations for rFVIIIFc DS, rBDD FVIII, and single chain rFVIIIFc (Figure 3A), using
        synthetic phospholipid vesicles (25% phosphotadyl serine/75% phosphotadyl choline).           Both
        proteins were found to have a similar activity profile, with peak activity at approximately 156 jM
        phospholipids.
[00218]           The FXa generation rate was then determined as a function of varying FX concentrations,
        and Km and Vmax values calculated (Figure 3B). The activity profiles for rFVIIIFc DS, rBDD
        FVIII, and single chain rFVIIIFc were found to be similar, with similar Km and Vmax (Table 4).
        Finally, the FXa generation rate was determined as a function of varying FIX concentrations
        (Figure 3C). The activity profiles appeared similar, with similar Kd and Vmax (Table 4). Similar
        results were obtained using platelets as a phospholipid source (unpublished data, June 2009).

        Inactivation by APC
[00219]          Once active, FVIII is inactivated by cleavage by activated protein C (APC), as well as by
        dissociation of the A2 domain. rFVIIIFc and rBDD FVIII were both activated by thrombin, then
        incubated with APC for different times and activity determined in a FXa generation assay (Figure
        4).   In the absence of thrombin activation, little FXa generation was detected, and this was
        increased significantly with thrombin digestion.         Treatment with APC for 90 min led to a
        significant decrease in FXa generation rates, similar to non-activated samples, and these results
        were similar for rFVIIIFc DS, rBDD FVIII, and single chain rFVIIIFc.
        Affinity for vWF
[00220]          FVIII interactions with von Willebrand factor (vWF) were measured by real-time
        biomolecular interaction analysis (BlAcore), based on surface Plasmon resonance (SPR)
        technology, to determine the kinetics of binding of rFVIIIFc and rBDD FVIII towards vWF
        (Table 6). Kinetic rate parameters of Ka (on-rate) and Kd (off-rate), and the affinity KD (Kd/Ka),
        were determined for each FVIII interaction under identical conditions. Both rFVIIIFc and rBDD
        FVIII were found to have a low nM binding affinity (KD) for vWF, of 1.64+0.37 and
        0.846+0.181 nM, respectively. The proteins had similar off-rates, with a two fold difference in
        on-rate resulting in a two fold difference in the affinity.

[00221]          As shown in Table 6, the affinity of rFVIII:Fc DS or single chain rFVIIIFc with vWF was
        found to be in the low nM range, approximately two fold greater than that of BDD FVIII alone.
        At physiological concentrations, this would result in a slight decrease in the percentage of
        rFVIIIFc (processed or single chain) complexed with vWF as compared to free FVIII, however in
                                                    - 60   -

        vivo studies have indicated that the half life of rFVIIIFc is significantly prolonged over full length
        or BDD FVIII despite this slightly lower affinity, and therefore this does not appear to
        compromise the half life of the molecule.       It may be possible that the free rFVIIIFc is more
        efficiently recycled through the FcRn pathway and therefore this may contribute to a greater
        prolongation of half life.
        Affinity for vWF and Thrombin-mediated Release from vWF
[00222]          Recombinant B-domain deleted Factor VIIIFc (rFVIIIFc) was expressed in HEK293
        cells. During biosynthesis in HEK293 cells, most of the rFVIIIFc is processed by limited
        proteolysis to generate a FVIII heavy chain (HC) and a FVIII light chain (LC) to which the Fc
        moiety is attached. Spontaneous disassociation of the HC and LC in plasma, and during storage of
        FVIII drug products, is thought to contribute to a loss of FVIII activity. The remaining portion of
        the biosynthesized rFVIIIFc, which is not processed, forms a single chain isoform of rFVIIIFc
        (SC rFVIIIFc), which may provide enhanced manufacturability and stability compared to the
        processed rFVIIIFc.
[002231          This example describes an assay comparing the interaction of SC rFVIIIFc with von
        Willebrand factor (vWF) in relation to the interaction of rFVIIIFc with vWF. Interactions with
        vWF were measured by real-time biomolecular interaction analysis (BlAcore), based on surface
        Plasmon resonance (SPR) technology, to determine the kinetics of binding of rFVIIIFc and SC
        rFVIIIFc towards vWF (Table 11 and Figure 16A). FVIII-free human plasma derived vWF was
        immobilized by amine coupling on the surface of a biosensor at levels low enough to prevent
        mass transport limitation. rFVIIIFc and SC rFVIIIFc were sequentially injected in single-cycle
        kinetics mode at concentrations ranging from 0.13 to 5.0 nM. Sensorgram data was fit to a 1:1
        interaction model.
[00224]          Kinetic rate parameters of Ka (on-rate) and Kd (off-rate), and the affinity KD (Kd/Ka),
        were determined for each FVIII interaction under identical conditions. Both rFVIIIFc and SC
        rFVIIIFc were found to have a low nM binding affinity (KD) for vWF, of 0.34+0.1 and 0.31+0.1
        nM, respectively. Both isoforms also had similar on-rates and off-rates.

[002251          Next, thrombin-mediated release of rFVIIIFc, SC rFVIIIFc, and B-domain deleted FVIII
        lacking Fc moieties (rBDD FVIII) was measured at both 250 C and 370 C. Human vWF was
        immobilized by amine coupling at similar levels on three flow cells on the biosensor surface. The
        remaining flow cell served as a blank for reference purposes. The rFVIIIFc and SC rFVIIIFc
        proteins were captured by vWF and allowed to slowly disassociate, and the concentrations of
        rFVIIIFc and SC rFVIIIFc were adjusted to obtain equimolar capture levels by the end of the
        dissociation phase. Human a-thrombin solutions were prepared by 2-fold serial dilution and
        applied at concentrations that ranged from 0.005 to 20 U/mL, resulting in proteolytic release of
        FVIIIa species from vWF. Thrombin mediated release of activated rFVIIIFc, SC rFVIIIFc, and
        rBDD FVIII from vWF was monitored in real-time using an SPR-based optical biosensor (Figure
        16B). Following blank reference subtraction (Figure 16C), the release rate as a function of a
        thrombin concentration was determined (Figure 16D). The thrombin half maximal effective
        concentration (EC5 o) for SC rFVIIIFc was 12+1 U/mL compared to 3.9+0.3 U/mL for rFVIIIFc at
        250 C and was 15+1 U/mL for SC rFVIIIFc compared to 4.8+0.2 U/mL for rFVIIIFc at 370 C
        (Figure 16E).    rFVIIIFc had a similar thrombin EC50 value compared to rBDD FVIII, having
        values of 3.9+0.3 U/mL and 3.3+0.3 U/mL, respectively at 25' C and values of 4.8+0.2 U/mL and
        4.0+0.2 U/mL, respectively at 370 C. SC rFVIIIFc had a thrombin EC5 0 value that was
        approximately 3-fold higher than rFVIIIFc. This impairment of thrombin mediated release from
        vWF may underlie the specific reduction in specific activity for SC rFVIIIFc observed in the
        aPTT assay in which vWF was present (Table 3B).
                                                    Example 3
[00226]          A Phase I/Ila, open-label, crossover, dose-escalation, multi-center, and first-in-human
        study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of
        rFVIIIFc in subjects with severe (defined as <1 IU/dL [1%] endogenous factor VIII [FVIII])
        hemophilia A. A total of approximately 12 previously treated patients were enrolled and dosed
        with rFVIIIFc at 25 or 65 IU/kg. After the screening (scheduled within 28 days prior to the first
        dose of the ADVATE@ [rFVIII], the reference comparator agent) and a minimum of 4-days (96
        hours) elapsing with no FVIII treatment prior to the first injection, approximately 6 subjects
        received a single 25 IU/kg dose of ADVATE@ followed by a 3-day (72 hours) pharmacokinetic
        (PK) profile then crossover and receive a 25 IU/kg single, open-label dose of rFVIIIFc for a 7-day
        (168 hours) PK profiling. The first 3 subjects were dosed sequentially. For the first three (3)
        subjects dosed with 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc, each subject underwent an inhibitor assessment at 14
        days (336 hours) post-injection of rFVIIIFc.      Dosing of the next subject (for the first three
        subjects only) occurred once the inhibitor testing is completed. After the 3rd subject completed
                                                  - 62  -

        the 14 day inhibitor assessment, the remaining three subjects at 25 IU/kg and the six subjects at 65
        IU/kg began enrollment sequentially at least 1 day apart within each dose group.
[002271          One week after the last subject received the 25 IU/kg dose of the rFVIIIFc, approximately
        6 unique subjects were recruited for the 65 IU/kg cohort. Each subject in the 65 IU/kg cohort
        received a single 65 IU/kg dose of ADVATE@ followed by a 4-day (96 hours) PK profiling then
        crossover and receive a 65 IU/kg single, open-label dose of rFVIIIFc for a 10-day (240 hours)
        profiling.   If a bleeding episode occurred before the first injection of rFVIIIFc in any cohort,
        subject's pre-study FVIII product was used for treatment and an interval of at least 4 days had to
        pass before receiving the first injection of rFVIIIFc for the PK profile.
[00228]          All subjects were followed for a 14-day (336 hours) and 28 day safety evaluation period
        after administration of rFVIIIFc 25 IU/kg or 65 IU/kg for safety.               All subjects underwent
        pharmacokinetic sampling pre- and post-dosing along with blood samples for analysis of FVIII
        activity at designated time points.
[00229]          The pharmacokinetic data for the Phase I/Ila clinical trial demonstrated the following
        results for FVIIIFc.    FVIIIFc had about a 50% increase in systemic exposure (AUCINF), about
        50% reduction in clearance (Cl), and about        5 0 -7 0 % increase in elimination half-life and MRT
        compared to ADVATE* (full length rFVIII).               In addition, FVIIIFc showed increased C168,
        TBLP1, TBLP3, and TBLP5 values compared to ADVATE*.

[00230]          A recombinant B-domain-deleted factor VIII-Fc (rFVIIIFc) fusion protein has been
        created as an approach to extend the half-life of FVIII. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of rFVIIIFc
        were compared to rFVIII in hemophilia A mice. We found that the terminal half-life was twice as
        long for rFVIIIFc compared to rFVIII. In order to confirm that the underlying mechanism for the
        extension of half-life was due to the protection of rFVIIIFc by FcRn, the PK were evaluated in
                                                     - 63   -

        FcRn knockout and human FcRn transgenic mice. A single intravenous dose (125 IU/kg) was
        administered and the plasma concentration measured using a chromogenic activity assay. The
        Cmax was similar between rFVIIIFc and rFVIII (XYNTHA®) in both mouse strains. However,
        while the half-life for rFVIIIFc was comparable to that of rFVIII in the FcRn knockout mice, the
        half-life for rFVIIIFc was extended to approximately twice longer than that for rFVIII in the
        hFcRn transgenic mice. These results confirm that FcRn mediates or is responsible for the
        prolonged half-life of rFVIIIFc compared to rFVIII. Since hemostasis in whole blood measured
        by rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM*) has been shown to correlate with the efficacy of
        coagulation factors in bleeding models of hemophilia mice as well as in clinical applications, we
        sought to evaluate the ex vivo efficacy of rFVIIIFc in the hemophilia A mice using ROTEM*.
        Hemophilia A mice were administered a single intravenous dose of 50 lU/kg rFVIIIFc,
        XYNTHA® (FVIII) or ADVATE@ (FVIII). At 5 minutes post dose, clot formation was similar
        with respect to clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT) and a-angle. However, rFVIIIFc
        showed significantly improved CT at 72 and 96 hr post dose, and CFT and a-angle were also
        improved at 96 hrs compared to both XYNTHA@ (FVIII) and ADVATE@ (FVIII), consistent
        with prolonged PIC of rFVIIIFc.      Therefore construction of an Fc fusion of FVIII produces a
        molecule with a defined mechanism of action that has an increased half-life and the potential to
        provide prolonged protection from bleeding.
                                                 Example 5
[00231]          This Example presents final analysis results for FVIII activity from 16 patients treated
        with 25 and 65 lU/kg FVIII products. See Example 3.
[00232]          In this Example, rFVIIIFc is a recombinant fusion protein comprised of a single molecule
        of recombinant B-domain deleted human FVIII (BDD-rFVIII) fused to the dimeric Fc domain of
        the human IgG1, with no intervening linker sequence. This protein construct is also referred to
        herein as rFVIIIFc heterodimeric hybrid protein, FVIIIFc monomeric Fc fusion protein, FVIIIFc
        monomer hybrid, monomeric FVIIIIFc hybrid, and FVIIIFc monomer-dimer.              See Example 1,
        Fig. 1, and Table 2A.
[00233]          Preclinical studies with rFVIIIFc have shown an approximately 2-fold prolongation of the
        half-life of rFVIII activity compared to commercially available rFVIII products. The rationale for
        this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of rFVIIIFc in frozen liquid
        formulation and provide data on the PIC in severe hemophilia A subjects.         For this study, 16
        evaluable subjects were available for PIC evaluation. Single administration of two doses of both
        rFVIIIFc and ADVATE* at a nominal dose of 25 (n=6) and 65 lU/kg of body weight (n=10) were
        infused intravenously over approximately 10 minutes. Blood samples for plasma PIC assessments
                                                   - 64 -

        were obtained before infusion, as well as up to 10 days after dosing. The PK of FVIII activity for
        both ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc were characterized in this study using a model-dependent method.
        OBJECTIVES
[00234]          The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of single
        administration of two doses of rFVIIIFc (25 and 65 IU/kg) in previously treated patients (PTPs)
        aged 12 and above with severe hemophilia A.
[002351          The secondary objectives were to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters
        determined by pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of FVIII over time after a single administration of
        25 or 65 lU/kg of rFVIIIFc compared to ADVATE* in one-stage clotting and chromogenic
        assays.
        Study Design (See Example 3)
[00236]          Blood samples were collected for FVIII activity PK evaluations at the screening visit
        (within 28 days prior to dosing ADVATE*); on Day 0 (injection of ADVATE*) pre-injection and
        at 10 and 30 minutes and 1, 3, 6, and 9 hours post-injection; on Day 1 at 24 hours post-injection
        of ADVATE*; on Day 2 at 48 hours post-injection of ADVATE®; on Day 3 at 72 hours post
        injection of ADVATE®; and on Day 4 at 96 hours post-injection of high dose of ADVATE®
        (Cohort B only).
[002371          Blood samples were collected for FVIII activity PK evaluations on the day of rFVIIIFc
        injection just prior to the administration of rFVIIIFc, at 10 and 30 minutes and 1, 3, 6, and 9 hours
        post-injection of rFVIIIFc; on Day 1 at 24 hours post-injection of rFVIIIFc; on Days 2 through 5
        at 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours post-injection of rFVIIIFc; on Day 7 at 168 hours post-injection of

        RESULTS
        Single-Dose Pharmacokinetics (One-Stage Assay)
[00238]         Observed FVIII activity increased sharply after the short IV infusion of either ADVATE*
        or rFVIIIFc, with mean (+SD) model-predicted Cmax values of 56.6 ± 4.74 and 121 ± 28.2 IU/dL
        for ADVATE* and 55.6 ± 8.18 and 108 ± 16.9 IU/dL for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose
        groups, respectively. All ADVATE*- and rFVIIIFc-treated patients had dose-related increases in
        FVIII activity.    The observed increase in both Cmax and AUC1 F was slightly less than
        proportional to dose over the dose range evaluated.
[00239]         After the end of the infusion, the decline of the observed FVIII activity exhibited
        monoexponential decay characteristics until the baseline level was reached. The rate of decline in
        FVIII activity was slower for rFVIIIFc than for ADVATE® with mean (+SD) model-predicted
        elimination half-life values of 11.9 ± 2.98 and 10.4 ± 3.03 hr for ADVATE* and 18.0 ± 3.88 and
        18.4 ± 6.99 hr for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. Elimination half
        life values appeared to be dose-independent over the dose range evaluated for both FVIII
        products.
[00240]         Total systemic FVIII exposure (assessed by AUC1 F) was ~ 48% and 61% greater
        following rFVIIIFc administration than ADVATE* at 25 and 65 IU/kg dose levels, respectively.
        Mean (+SD) model-predicted AUCINF values were 974 i 259 and 1810 ± 606 hr*IU/dL for
        ADVATE* and 1440 ± 316 and 2910 ± 1320 hr*IU/dL for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose
        groups, respectively.
[00241]          Similar to elimination half-life, the MRT was prolonged for rFVIIIFc relative to
        ADVATE®. Mean (+SD) model-predicted MRT values were 17.1 ± 4.29 and 14.9 ± 4.38 hr for
        ADVATE® and 25.9 ± 5.60 and 26.5 ± 10.1 hr for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups,
        respectively.  MRT values appeared to be dose-independent over the dose range evaluated for
        both FVIII products.
[00242]         In addition, primary PK parameter values for CL and V were determined. CL values for
        rFVIIIFc only accounted for ~ 66% of those observed for ADVATE® at equivalent doses. Mean
        (+SD) model-predicted CL values were 2.70 ± 0.729 and 4.08 ± 1.69 mL/hr/kg for ADVATE®
        and 1.80 ± 0.409 and 2.69 ± 1.25 mL/hr/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups,
        respectively.  V values were comparable between ADVATE® and rFVIIIFc with mean (+SD)
        model-predicted V values of 43.9 ± 4.27 and 56.1 ± 13.4 mL/kg for ADVATE® and 45.3 ± 7.23
                                                   - 66 -

        and 61.6 ± 10.6 mL/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 lU/kg dose groups, respectively.       Slight
        increases in mean CL and V values were noted with increasing dose of ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc;
        however, the increase in standard deviations at the 65 lU/kg dose coupled with limited dose levels
        confounded an assessment of the dose-dependency of these parameters. For example, the CV%
        geometric mean CL value for the rFVIIIFc treatment group increased from 23.0% (25 IU/kg) to
        48.6% (65 IU/kg).
[00243]          In addition to the primary PK parameters, secondary PK parameters (e.g. K-values, IVR,
        etc.) were determined to evaluate FVIII duration of effect.    Evidence of PK difference was also
        observed with rFVIIIFc demonstrating increased TBLPland TBLP3 values compared to
        ADVATE* at equivalent doses. IVR and K-values for ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc appeared to be
        comparable. A slight increase in TBLP1 and TBLP3 values were observed with increasing dose
        of ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc. In contrast, slight decreases in mean IVR and K-values were noted
        with increasing dose of ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc. As previously indicated, an assessment of the
        dose dependency of these parameters is confounded by limited dose levels.
[00244]          Mean (+SD) observed TBLP1 were 2.88 ± 0.733 and 2.93 ± 0.848 IU/dL per lU/kg for
        ADVATE® and 4.28 ± 0.873 and 5.16 ± 2.02 IU/dL per lU/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65
        lU/kg dose groups, respectively. Mean (+SD) observed TBLP3 were 2.06 ± 0.527 and 2.26 ±
        0.666 IU/dL per IU/kg for ADVATE* and 3.09 ± 0.623 and 3.93 ± 1.59 IU/dL per lU/kg for
        rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 lU/kg dose groups, respectively.
[002451          Mean IVR and K-values calculated using observed Cmax values (subtracted with baseline
        and residual drug within the model) were generally greater than values determined using model
        predicted Cmax values; consistent with slight underestimation of the observed peak activity using
        the one-compartment model. Mean (+SD) observed K-values were 2.57 ± 0.198 and 2.13 ± 0.598
        IU/dL per IU/kg for ADVATE® and 2.46 ± 0.330 and 1.85 ± 0.332 IU/dL per lU/kg for rFVIIIFc
        for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. Mean (+SD) observed IVR values were 94.1 ±
        15.6 and 85.8 ± 16.5 % for ADVATE* and 89.5 ± 11.9 and 74.8 ± 6.72 % for rFVIIIFc for the 25
        and 65 lU/kg dose groups, respectively.
        Single-Dose Pharmacokinetics (Chromogenic Assay)
[00246]          Observed FVIII activity increased sharply after the short IV infusion of either ADVATE®
        or rFVIIIFc, with mean (+SD) model-predicted Cmax values of 70.2 ± 9.60 and 157 ± 38.6 IU/dL
        for ADVATE® and 70.3 ± 10.0 and 158 ± 34.7 IU/dL for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 lU/kg dose
        groups, respectively.
[002471          All ADVATE®- and rFVIIIFc-treated patients had dose-related increases in FVIII
        activity. The observed increase in both Cmax and AUC 1N was slightly less than proportional to
        dose over the dose range evaluated.

[002481         After the end of the infusion, the decline of the observed FVIII activity exhibited
        monoexponential decay characteristics until the baseline level was reached. The rate of decline in
        FVIII activity was slower for rFVIIIFc than for ADVATE* with mean (+SD) model-predicted
        elimination half-life values of 10.7 ± 1.98 and 10.3 ± 3.27 hr for ADVATE* and 16.2 ± 2.92 and
        19.0 ± 7.94 hr for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. Elimination half
        life values appeared to be dose-independent over the dose range evaluated for both FVIII
        products.
[00249]         Total systemic FVIII exposure (assessed by AUC1 F) was ~ 53% and 84% greater
        following rFVIIIFc administration than ADVATE* at 25 and 65 IU/kg dose levels, respectively.
        Mean (+SD) model-predicted AUCINF values were 1080 i 236 and 2320 i 784 hr*IU/dL for
        ADVATE* and 1650 ± 408 and 4280 ± 1860 hr*IU/dL for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose
        groups, respectively.
[002501          Similar to elimination half-life, the MRT was prolonged for rFVIIIFc relative to
        ADVATE*. Mean (+SD) model-predicted MRT values were 15.3 ± 2.86 and 14.8 ± 4.72 hr for
        ADVATE* and 23.4 ± 4.22 and 27.3 ± 11.4 hr for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups,
        respectively. MRT values appeared to be dose-independent over the dose range evaluated for
        both FVIII products.
[002511         In addition, primary PK parameter values for CL and V were determined. CL values for
        rFVIIIFc only accounted for ~ 5 8 - 6 6 % of those observed for ADVATE* at equivalent doses.
        Mean (+SD) model-predicted CL values were 2.39 ± 0.527 and 3.21 ± 1.40 mL/hr/kg for
        ADVATE* and 1.57 ± 0.349 and 1.86 ± 0.970 mL/hr/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg
        dose groups, respectively. V values were comparable between ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc with
        mean (+SD) model-predicted V values of 35.8 ± 5.52 and 43.6 ± 11.2 mL/kg for ADVATE* and
        35.9 ± 6.65 and 42.7 ± 8.91 mL/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups,
        respectively. Increases in mean CL and V values were noted with increasing dose of ADVATE*
        and rFVIIIFc; however, the increase in standard deviations at 65 IU/kg coupled with limited dose
        levels confounded an assessment of the dose-dependency of these parameters.
[00252]         In addition to the primary PK parameters, secondary PK parameters (e.g. K-values, IVR,
        etc.) were determined to evaluate FVIII duration of effect. Evidence of PK difference was also
        observed with rFVIIIFc demonstrating increased TBLPland TBLP3 values compared to
        ADVATE* at equivalent doses. IVR and K-values for ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc appeared to be
        comparable.
[00253]         A slight increase in TBLP1 and TBLP3 values were observed with increasing dose of
        ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc. In contrast, slight decreases in mean IVR and K-values were noted
        with increasing dose of ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc. As previously indicated, an assessment of the
        dose dependency of these parameters is confounded by limited dose levels.

[002541           Mean (+SD) observed TBLP1 were 2.70 ± 0.511 and 3.09 ± 0.978 IU/dL per IU/kg for
        ADVATE* and 4.06 ± 0.798 and 5.66 ± 2.38 IU/dL per IU/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65
        IU/kg dose groups, respectively. Mean (+SD) observed TBLP3 were 1.98 ± 0.377 and 2.39 ±
        0.718 IU/dL per IU/kg for ADVATE* and 3.04 ± 0.598 and 4.44 ± 1.84 IU/dL per IU/kg for
        rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively.
[002551           Mean IVR and K-values calculated using observed Cmax values (subtracted with baseline
        and residual drug within the model) were generally greater than values determined using model

        and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively.
        CONCLUSIONS
[00256]           All ADVATE*- and rFVIIIFc-treated patients had comparable dose-related increases in
        Cmax and AUCINF over the dose range evaluated.                Peak plasma levels of ADVATE® and
        rFVIIIFc activity were generally observed within the first hour after the end of the infusion and
        remained detectable for several days after dosing.        After the end of infusion, the decline in
        baseline corrected FVIII activity exhibited monoexponential decay until the baseline was reached
        for both products.      Parameter values for elimination half-life and MRT appeared to be dose
        independent over the dose range evaluated for both FVIII products. Slight increases in mean CL
        and V values were noted with increasing dose of ADVATE® and rFVIIIFc; however, increased
        intersubject variability at the 65 IU/kg coupled with limited dose levels confounded an assessment
        of the dose-dependency of these parameters.
[002571           Comparison of rFVIIIFc and ADVATE® activity PK revealed an approximate 48-61%
        (One-Stage Assay) or     5 3 -8 4 % (Chromogenic Assay) increase in systemic exposure, approximate
        3 0 -4 0 % reduction in clearance, and an approximate  5 0 -8 0 % increase in both elimination half-life
        and MRT for rFVIIIFc relative to ADVATE® at comparable doses. Evidence of PK difference
        was also observed with rFVIIIFc demonstrating increased TBLP 1 and TBLP3 values compared to
        ADVATE® at equivalent doses. IVR and K-values for ADVATE® and rFVIIIFc appeared to be
        comparable.
[00258]           The PK parameters obtained from the Chromogenic Assay results generally agreed with
        those from the One-Stage Assay, except that the Chomogenic Assay yielded a higher estimation
        of exposure parameters (e.g., Cmax, AUCINF, etc.).

[002591          With the observed improvements in PK, rFVIIIFc may provide a prolonged protection
        from bleeding, allowing less frequent injections for individuals with Hemophilia A.
                                                 Example 6
[00260]          On the basis of the interim PK analysis from the first in-human study of rFVIII:Fc
        (Example 3), the A-LONG study was designed.             A-LONG is an open label, multi-center
        evaluation of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of recombinant Factor VIII Fc fusion
        (FVIII:Fc) in the prevention and treatment of bleeding in previously treated subjects with severe
        hemophilia A (defined as <1 IU/dL [<1%] endogenous FVIII).
[00261]          Approximately 106 subjects will be enrolled into one of three regimens: a tailored
        prophylaxis regimen (arm 1), a weekly dosing regimen (arm 2), and an on-demand regimen (arm
        3).
        Arm 1: Tailored Prophylaxis Regimen
[00262]          Arm 1 will include an overall group and a PK subgroup. Approximately 66 subjects will
        be enrolled. The initial regimen will be twice weekly at 25 IU/kg on the first day, followed by 50
        IU/kg on the fourth day of the week.          Subjects will administer rFVIIIFc on this weekly
        prophylaxis regimen until PK results for rFVIIIFc are available. Based on these results, a tailored
        prophylaxis regimen will be established for each individual, in which the dose and interval will be
        determined to maintain a trough level of 1-3% FVIII activity. Each subject will then administer
        his individually tailored prophylaxis regimen throughout the study.
[00263]          Subjects will be monitored throughout the study and ongoing dose and interval
        adjustments will be made.        Adjustments will only be made when a subject experiences
        unacceptable bleeding episodes defined as >2 spontaneous bleeding episodes over a rolling two
        month period. In this case, adjustment will target trough levels of 3-5%.
        Arm 2: Weekly Dosing Regimen
[00264]          Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled/randomized           and undergo    abbreviated
        rFVIIIFc PK profiling as follows: Washout of at least 96 hours; a single dose of rFVIIIFc 65
        IU/kg; Abbreviated sampling beginning on rFVIIIFc Day 0, including pre-injection and 10 (+2)
        minutes, 3 hours (± 15 minutes), 72 (± 2) hours [Day 3], and 96 (± 2) hours [Day 4] from the start
        of injection. Following the abbreviated PK profiling, subjects will then administer a fixed dose of
        65 IU/kg rFVIIIFc every 7 days at least for 28 weeks and up to 52 weeks.
                                                   - 70 -

        Arm 3: On-demand Regimen
[002651         A minimum of 10 major surgeries in at least 5 subjects will be evaluated in the study.
        Major surgery is defined as any surgical procedure (elective or emergent) that involves general
        anesthesia and/or respiratory assistance in which a major body cavity is penetrated and exposed,
        or for which a substantial impairment of physical or physiological functions is produced (e.g.,
        laparotomy, thoracotomy, craniotomy, joint replacement, and limb amputation).
[00266]         For prophylaxis during surgery, subjects will be treated with 20 to 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc
        every 12 to 24 hours. Prior to surgery, the physician will review the subject's rFVIIIFc PK profile
        and assess the dose regimen of Factor VIII replacement generally required for the type of planned
        surgery and the clinical status of the subject.   Recommendation for the appropriate dosing of
        rFVIIIFc in the surgical treatment period, including any rehabilitation time, will take these factors
        into consideration.
[002671         The primary objectives of this study are (a) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
        rFVIIIFc administered as prophylaxis, on-demand, and surgical treatment regimens; and (b) to
        evaluate the efficacy of rFVIIIFc administered as prophylaxis, on-demand, and surgical treatment
        regimens.    The secondary objectives of this study are (a) to characterize the PK profile of
        rFVIIIFc and compare the PK of FVIIIFc with the currently marketed product, ADVATE*; (b) to
        evaluate individual responses with FVIIIFc; and (c) to evaluate FVIIIFc consumption.
        Primary Objectives
             * To evaluate safety and tolerability of rFVIIIFc administered as prophylaxis, weekly, on
            demand, and surgical treatment regimens
             * To evaluate the efficacy of rFVIIIFc administered as tailored prophylaxis, on-demand,
            and surgical treatment regimens
        Secondary Objectives
             * To characterize the PK profile of rFVIIIFc and compare the PK of rFVIIIFc with the
            currently marketed product, ADVATE*
             *  To evaluate individual responses with rFVIIIFc
             * To characterize the range of dose and schedules required to adequately prevent bleeding
            in a prophylaxis regimen; maintain homeostasis in a surgical setting; or to treat bleeding
            episodes in an on-demand, weekly treatment, or prophylaxis setting
             * To evaluate rFVIIIFc consumption (e.g., total annualized rFVIIIFc consumption per
            subject)

        Clinical ROTEM* Assessment
[00268]          In the study in Example 7, in addition to the measurement of plasma FVIII activity by
        one-stage    activated  partial thromboplastin      time  (aPTT)     assay, whole blood rotational
        thromboelastometry (ROTEM*) has also been explored to assess the improvement in global
        hemostasis by rFVIIIFc and ADVATE® in 2 subjects, specifically, 1 in the low dose cohort and 1
        in the high dose cohort.
[00269]          rFVIIIFc and ADVATE* appear to be comparably active in clot formation when spiked
        into subjects' blood prior to rFVIIIFc treatment. The clotting time (CT) was linear with respect to
        the dose of rFVIIIFc and ADVATE® in the range of approximately 1% of 100% of normal, and
        the dose response was comparable between rFVIIIFc and ADVATE® in the same subject.
[00270]          Following dosing with ADVATE* and subsequently rFVIIIFc, citrated whole blood was
        sampled at various time points and the clot formation following recalcification was monitored by
        ROTEM*. Despite the variable baseline CT due to residue FVIII levels prior to ADVATE* or
        rFVIIIFc dosing, both products effectively corrected the CT to comparable levels 30 minutes
        post-injection. In addition, the improvement in CT was better sustained at and after 3 hours post
        injection of 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc relative to ADVATE® in the subject dosed at this low dose.
        However, the differential improvement of rFVIIIFc versus ADVATE® was much less appreciable
        at the 65 IU/kg dose.

[002711          HemA mice were used for tail clip studies. The mice were first anesthetized and then
        injected with 4.6 jig/kg, 1.38 jig/kg, or 0.46 jig/kg of either processed rFVIIIFc (Drug Substance,
        which contain about 75%-85% processed rFVIIIFc) and purified single chain rFVIIIFc. After the
        injection, the tail was cut from the tip and immediately placed into a tube to collect blood.
        Percentage of protection on survival was measured for rFVIIIFc processed (drug substance) and
        single chain FVIIIFc as shown in Table 7 and Figure 7.

[002721          As shown in Table 7 and Figure 7, the protection on survival by single chain rFVIIIFc is
        comparable to processed rFVIIIFc (DS).
        Clotting activity by in vitro ROTEM
[00273]          The clotting potency of rFVIIIFc was further explored in whole blood Rotational
        Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) over a range of concentrations, and compared to both rBDD
        FVIII (Xyntha) and recombinant full length FVIII (rflFVIII; Advate).          For in vitro ROTEM,
        rFVIII proteins were spiked in triplicate into citrated pooled blood collected from the vena cava of
        5-6 male HemA mice to the final concentration of 0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100% of normal plasma FVIII
        level.  The clot was initiated by the addition of CaCl 2 (NATEM) and clotting time (CT), clot
        formation time (CFT), alpha-angle and maximum clot firmness (MCF) were recorded on the
        ROTEM system (Pentapharm GmbH, Munich, Germany). The clotting time (CT), clot formation
        time (CFT), and alpha angle for the three proteins spiked in HemA mouse blood at escalating
        doses from 0.1 - 100 % of normal FVIII levels are shown in Figure 14. In the wide range of 0.1
        to 100% of normal, the CT and CFT are comparable among rFVIIIFc, rBDD FVIII and rflFVIII.
        The alpha angle is only significantly different (p<0.05) between rFVIIIFc and rBDD FVIII at
        10%.
        Clotting activity by ex vivo ROTEM
[00274]          The pharmacodynamics of rFVIIIFc, as measured by ROTEM, was compared to rBDD
        FVIII and rflFVIII after a single intravenous injection into Hemophilia A mice. For ex vivo
        ROTEM, male HemA mice were injected intravenously with a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc,
        ADVATE*, or XYNTHA*, and 5 mice sacrificed at each time point (5 minutes, 24, 48, 72 and 96
        hours post dosing).       Individual citrated whole blood collected from the vena cava was
        immediately analyzed by NATEM on the ROTEM system and parameters measured as above.
        The CT, CFT, and alpha angle were determined for samples taken from 5 min to 96 hours after
        dosing, and shown in Figure 15. At 5 min, all are comparably effective resulting in similar CT,
        CFT and alpha angle (Figure 15A - C).             However, rFVIIIFc demonstrated a significantly
        improved (p<0.05) CT at 72 and 96 hrs, CFT and alpha angle at 96 hrs (Figures 15A - C) relative
        to rBDD FVIII and rflFVIII.
                                                       Example 9
[00275]          Recombinant factor VIIIFc (rFVIIIFc) is comprised of a B domain deleted (BDD) rFVIII
        protein genetically fused to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin GI (IgGI).               Prior to
        secretion from HEK 293 cells, most of the rFVIIIFc is processed into a FVIII heavy chain (HC)
        and light chain (LC+Fc).       In circulation, rFVIIIFc is complexed with von Willebrand factor
        (VWF) and released upon activation in a manner that is indistinguishable from native FVIII.
        Spontaneous dissociation of the HC and LC is thought to contribute to the loss of FVIII activity in
                                                     - 73 -

        plasma and during storage of FVIII drug products. Here we describe a single chain non-processed
        isoform of rFVIIIFc (SC rFVIIIFc), which may provide superior manufacturability and enhanced
        stability compared to native FVIII.
[00276]           SC rFVIIIFc was purified from rFVIIIFc, which contains a fraction of the non-processed
        isoform. Compared to rFVIIIFc, SC rFVIIIFc showed equivalent chromogenic activity but
        approximately 60% reduced activity by the one stage (aPTT) assay, (Table 3A-B). Thrombin
        generation assay (TGA) was performed using calibrated automated thrombogram (from
        Thrombinoscope*). In a thrombin generation assay (TGA), SC rFVIIIFc also showed a reduced
        thrombin potential (Figure 13A), and        peak thrombin (Figure 13B) compared to rFVIIIFc.
        However, as shown in Table 3B, full activity of SC rFVIIIFc by aPTT was observed in the
        absence of vWF, suggesting release from vWF may be delayed due to covalent linkage of the a3
        acidic region to the HC after Arg 1680 cleavage in SC rFVIIIFc, in contrast to a3 release and
        dissociation from fully processed FVIII.       Delayed dissociation from vWF may explain the
        reduced activity observed in the aPTT assay and TGA, while full activity was observed in the
        two-stage chromogenic assay.       A reduced rate of activation in the presence of vWF was
        confirmed in a modified chromogenic substrate assay with limiting thrombin as FVIII activator.
[00277]          In vivo function of SC rFVIIIFc was assessed in the HemA mouse tail vein transection
        (TVT) model. HemA male mice were treated with indicated doses of either rFVIIIFc drug product
        or SC rFVIIIFc 48 hours prior to TVT. Tail re-bleeding and survival were monitored hourly up to
        12 hours post TVT with final observation performed at 24-hour post TVT. SC rFVIIIFc and the
        rFVIIIFc demonstrated equivalent in vivo efficacy in this model, with an ED50 of 1.17 gg/kg and
        1.23 gg /kg respectively when TVT was performed at 48 hours post infusion (Figure 7(A)).
        Comparable 24 hour post TVT survival curves (p > 0.65) (Figure 7(B)) and re-bleed rates (Figure
        7(C)) in HemA mice were observed for the SC rFVIIIFc and rFVIIIFc at each tested dose level,
        indicating that SC rFVIIIFc was equally effective as rFVIIIFc despite its lower apparent aPTT
        activity. The delayed in vitro activation of SC rFVIIIFc in the presence of vWF therefore appears
        to have no significant impact on its in vivo efficacy. Thus, SC rFVIIIFc represents a novel and
        efficacious isoform of rFVIIIFc with potential clinical applications. Further studies will be
        required to demonstrate enhanced product stability in the context of this Fc fusion protein.
                                                Example 10
[00278]          Current factor VIII (FVIII) products display a half-life (t 1 /2 ) of approximately 8-12 hours,
        requiring frequent intravenous injections for prophylaxis and treatment of hemophilia A patients.
        rFVIIIFc is a recombinant fusion protein composed of a single molecule of FVIII covalently
        linked to the Fc domain of human IgG to extend circulating rFVIII half-life. This first-in-human
                                                   - 74 -

        study in previously-treated male subjects with severe hemophilia A investigated safety and
        pharmacokinetics of rFVIIIFc. Sixteen subjects received a single dose of ADVATE* at 25 or
        65 IU/kg followed by an equal dose of rFVIIIFc. Most adverse events were unrelated to study
        drug. None of the study subjects developed anti-FVIIIFc antibodies or inhibitors. Across dose
        levels, as compared with ADVATE*, rFVIIIFc showed 1.54 to 1.71-fold longer elimination               t1 /2
        and mean residence time, 1.49 to 1.56-fold lower clearance, and 1.48 to 1.56-fold higher total
        systemic exposure. ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc had comparable dose-dependent peak plasma
        concentrations and recoveries. Time to 1% FVIII activity above baseline was approximately 1.53
        to 1.68-fold longer than ADVATE* across dose levels. Thus, rFVIIIFc may offer a viable
        therapeutic approach to achieve prolonged hemostatic protection and less frequent dosing in
        patients with hemophilia A.
[002791          Hemophilia A is an inherited bleeding disorder that results in frequent spontaneous and
        traumatic bleeding into the joints and soft tissues. Mannucci PM, Tuddenham EGD, N Engl J
        Med, 344:1773-1779 (2001).          When inadequately treated, this bleeding leads to chronic
        arthropathy, disability, and increased risk of death.         Soucie JM et al., Blood. 96(2):437-442
        (2000).
[00280]          Plasma-derived FVIII (pdFVIII) and recombinant human FVIII (rFVIII) products are
        utilized for treatment (on-demand therapy) and prevention (prophylaxis therapy) of bleeding
        episodes. rFVIII was developed to reduce the risk of blood-borne pathogen transmission
        following the widespread contamination of plasma products with HIV and hepatitis viruses, and
        to secure an adequate supply of FVIII product. However, hemostatic protection with current FVIII
        products is temporally limited due to a short half-life (t 1 /2) of approximately 8-12 hours, requiring
        prophylactic injections three times per week or every other day for most patients in order to
        maintain FVIII levels above 1%, a level that has been established as protective against most
        spontaneous bleeding episodes. Manco-Johnson et al., New Engl JMed. 357(6):535-44 (2007).
[00281]          Many studies have shown that, even at high doses, on-demand therapy is not effective in
        preventing arthropathy. Aledort L. et al., J Intern Med. 236:391-399 (1994); Petrini P. et
        al., Am J PediatrHematol Oncol.13:280-287 (1991). The benefits of prophylactic therapy
        have been demonstrated in numerous clinical studies           4, 6-15 and Manco-Johnson et al., supra,
        established that children started on primary prophylaxis after their first joint bleed had
        significantly fewer bleeds and less joint damage than children treated on-demand.
[00282]          Compared to on-demand treatment, prophylactic therapy also decreases disability,
        hospitalization rate, and time lost from school or work;6"16 and improves quality of life for patients
        and their families.    However, prophylactic therapy often requires use of central venous access
        devices in children, and their attendant risks of infection, sepsis, and thrombosis. In addition,
        despite the benefits, acceptance of and compliance with prophylaxis decreases with age, in part

[00283]           rFVIIIFc is a recombinant fusion protein composed of a single molecule of B-domain
        deleted rFVIII covalently linked to the human IgG, Fc domain. Potential advantages of Fc-fusion
        proteins include better tolerability and prolonged hemostatic protection, and the Fc domain
        represents a natural molecule with no known inherent toxicity.2 1'22 Attachment to the IgGi Fc
        domain permits binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is expressed in many cell
        types, including endothelial cells. FcRn expression remains stable throughout life and is
        responsible for protecting IgGi and Fc-fusion proteins from lysosomal degradation, thus
                                                   21,23
        prolonging the    t 1 /2 of the protein.         Numerous proteins within the circulation are internalized
        into the cells lining the vasculature via nonspecific pinocytosis and are trafficked to endosomal
        and lysosomal degradation pathways.
[00284]           Fc proteins interact with FcRn, resident within endosomes. Endosomes containing FcRn
        direct the Fc fusion proteins back to the plasma membrane, releasing them into circulation in a
        pH-dependent manner,              thereby avoiding lysosomal degradation. This recycling approach has
        been used successfully to extend the             t 1 /2  of therapeutic biologics; a number of Fc fusion-based
        drugs have been approved for clinical use (eg etanercept, romiplostim) and others are in
        development.25,26
[002851           Preclinical data for rFVIIIFc indicate that FVIII can be rescued from degradation by a
        natural protective pathway mediated by FcRn, thus extending                     t 1 /2 . In Hemophilia A mice and
        dogs, terminal plasma        t 1 /2 for rFVIIIFc was approximately 2 times longer than with rFVIII.27 28         ,
        Based on these data, we conducted a first-in-human clinical study to investigate the safety and PK
        of a long-lasting rFVIIIFc fusion protein in subjects with hemophilia A.
[00286]           Study Design:        This     open-label, dose-escalation,        multicenter Phase        1/2a study in
        previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A investigated the safety of rFVIIIFc and its
        pharmacokinetics         (PK) compared with ADVATE*                     (antihemophilic       factor [recombinant],
        plasma/albumin-free method, octocog alfa, Baxter Healthcare). This study was performed in
        accordance with the US CFR and ICH Guidelines on Good Clinical Practices. Prior to any testing,
        approval from participating Institutional Review Boards and written informed consents from all
        subjects were obtained. The study design was sequential; a single dose of ADVATE* was
        administered at 25 or 65 IU/kg followed by an equal dose of rFVIIIFc (FIG. 8). Both drugs were
        injected intravenously over approximately 10 minutes. The two dose levels were expected to
        bracket the typical therapeutic dose ranges. Subjects were followed for 28 days after receiving
        rFVIIIFc for safety analyses, including testing for anti-FVIII antibodies and inhibitors at 14 and
        28 days post-injection. Plasma FVIII activity was measured in subjects before injection, 10 and 30
                                                                - 76  -

        minutes, 1, 3, 6, 9, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 168 hours (7 days) after rFVIIIFc injection, with
        additional samples at 192, 216, and 240 hours (10 days) for subjects dosed at 65 1U/kg of
        rFVIIIFc. Plasma FVIII activity was measured at the same time points after ADVATE* treatment,
        through 72 hours for the 25 IU/kg group and 96 hours for the 65 IU/kg group.
[002871          Subjects: Male subjects were at least 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A (defined
        as FVIII activity level < 1%) and had at least 100 documented prior exposure days to FVIII
        concentrates (pdFVIII or rFVIII). Subjects with known hypersensitivity to mouse or hamster
        protein, history of inhibitor or detectable inhibitor titer at screening, or who were taking any
        medications that could affect hemostasis         or systemic immunosuppressive       drugs, or who
        experienced an active bacterial or viral infection (other than hepatitis or HIV) within 30 days of
        screening were excluded. Subject's genotype was recorded at study entry, when known.
[00288]          Treatment Product: The human rFVIIIFc and Fc transgenes were stably transfected into
        HEK293     cells and the cell line was extensively tested for stability, sterility, and viral
        contamination to ensure safety. The purified drug product is composed of a monomeric B
        domain-deleted FVIII covalently linked through its carboxy-terminus to the N-terminus of an Fc
        monomer, which forms a disulfide bond with a second Fc monomer during synthesis and
        secretion from the cells. rFVIIIFc was purified by chromatography and nanofiltration, and was
        fully active in one-stage and chromogenic clotting assays relative to commercially available
        rFVIII preparations. It was supplied as a frozen liquid containing 1000 IU per 2 mL of solution
        and formulated with L-histidine (pH 7), sodium chloride, calcium chloride, sucrose, mannitol, and
        Polysorbate 20. For injection, the product was diluted with saline solution (0. 9 % NaCl).
[00289]          Outcome Measures:         The primary objective of the study was safety, evaluated through
        physical examination, reporting of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), development of
        antibodies, and laboratory monitoring over time. The secondary objectives included parameters
        derived from PK analyses. Laboratory assessments included prothrombin time, activated partial
        thromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio, levels of D-dimer, von Willebrand
        factor (vWF) antigen, standard hematology and blood chemistry tests, and urinalysis.
[00290]          FVIII activity was measured by the one-stage clotting (aPTT) assay on a Siemens
        BCS-XP analyzer using commercial reagents (Dade Actin FSL) with calibration against a normal
        reference   plasma   (Precision    Biologics   CRYOcheck TM ) traceable     to the    World   Health
        Organization (WHO)     5 th International Standard (IS) for human plasma. In addition to the aPTT
        assay, FVIII activity was measured by a chromogenic substrate assay29 using a commercially
        available kit (Aniara BIOPHEN FVIII:C)             that complies with European Pharmacopoeia
        recommendations. The chromogenic assay was calibrated against normal human reference plasma
        (Instrumentation Laboratories ORKE45), which also had a potency assigned against the WHO 5th
        IS human plasma standard.

[002911          The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for the one-stage and chromogenic assays was
        0.5   IU/dL     and 0.4 IU/dL, respectively.      FVIII inhibitors were      measured by the
        *Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay and less than 0.6 BU/mL was considered negative. Anti
        rFVIIIFc     antibodies   were   assessed using    a specific bridging    electrochemiluminescent
        immunoassay which uses biotin and sulfo-tagged rFVIIIFc. Assay sensitivity was determined to
        be 89 ng/mL using an anti-human FVIII monoclonal antibody as a surrogate control. Exploratory
        whole blood rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM*) was performed in two subjects, one from
        each dose level, at various time points to assess the improvement in global hemostasis following
        injection with ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc.
[00292]          Pharmacokinetic Analyses:         A user-defined one-compartment disposition model,
        which automatically estimates the endogenous FVIII level and subsequent residual decay, was
        utilized in WinNonLin for analysis of the individual subject plasma FVIII activity-versus-time
        data following a single administration of ADVATE* or rFVIIIFc. Actual sampling times, doses,
        and duration of injection were used for calculations of parameters including maximum activity
        (Cmax), t1 /2 , clearance (CL), volume of distribution at steady-state (V,,), area under the curve
        (time zero extrapolated to infinity [AUCINF]), mean residence time (MRT), and incremental
        recovery.

        activity-time profiles following dosing regimens of 25 IU/kg or 65 IU/kg, a Monte Carlo
        simulation was conducted using the population PK model of ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc. The mean
        estimates of model parameters (CL, volume of distribution) in the tested population, the inter
        individual variance, and the residual variability were estimated based on the one-stage (aPTT)
        clotting assay activity data of ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc from 16 subjects in this Phase1/2a study.
        Five hundred subjects were simulated with 15 sampling points for each subject for each dosing
        regimen. The percentage of the population with FVIII activity above or equal to 1% and 3% at
        different times following different dosing regimens of ADVATE* or rFVIIIFc was estimated.
[00294]           Statistical Analyses -   Selected PK parameters for rFVIIIFc and ADVATE* were
        compared using an analysis of variance model. PK parameters were log-transformed for these
        analyses and estimated means, mean differences, and confidence intervals on the log-scale were
        transformed to obtain estimates for geometric means, geometric mean ratios (GMR), and
        confidence intervals, respectively, on the original scale. The GMR is the geometric mean of the
        intra-subject ratio of the rFVIIIFc PK parameter value to the ADVATE* PK parameter value.
        Results
[002951           Subject Disposition-     Nineteen subjects were enrolled in the study; 16 underwent PK
        evaluation for both ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc. One subject self-administered his previous product
        prior to completing the wash-out period following the dose with ADVATE* and was thus
                                                    -78 -

        excluded from the PK analysis, but was included in the safety analysis. Three subjects were
        discontinued from the study before receiving either study drug: one voluntarily withdrew; a
        second was withdrawn by the Investigator for non-compliance; and one was withdrawn at the
        Sponsor's request due to completion of study enrollment.       Of the subjects dosed, six subjects
        received 25 IU/kg and 10 subjects received 65 IU/kg of both ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc. Mean age
        was 40.3 years (23 to 61 years). Genotypic identification was collected for seven subjects;
        inversion of intron 22 was reported in six subjects; and a frame-shift defect was reported in one
        subject. The genotype was unknown for nine subjects. Thirteen subjects had hepatitis C
        antibodies, four of whom were also positive for HIV.
[00296]          Safety - Forty-four treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 11 (69%) subjects during
        the treatment and follow-up periods. This included the day of dosing with Advate or rFVIIIFc
        through a 28-day post-dosing observation period. The majority of events were considered mild
        and none led to withdrawal from the study. One event, dysgeusia, occurred transiently in one
        subject while receiving a 65 IU/kg dose of rFVIIIFc and was considered related to rFVIIIFc.
[002971          One subject experienced an anxiety attack after receiving 65 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc which
        resulted in 21 AEs, 19 of which were graded as mild, and two of which (headache and
        photophobia) were rated as moderate. Neither was deemed related to rFVIIIFc by the Investigator.
[00298]          No serious bleeding episodes were reported. No evidence of allergic reactions to injection
        was detected. All plasma samples tested negative for FVIII inhibitors and anti-rFVIIIFc
        antibodies. No signs of injection site reactions were observed. No clinically meaningful changes
        in abnormal laboratory values were reported.
[00299]          Pharmacokinetics: Correlation Between aPTT and Chromogenic Activity for rFVIIIFc in
        Plasma -          ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc activities were determined in the same assays using
        commercially available reagents and calibration against normal human plasma standards. There
        was a strong correlation between the results obtained by the one-stage clotting assay and the
        chromogenic assay in samples that had an activity above the LLOQ. Correlation coefficients
        (Pearson R 2 ) of 0.94 and 0.95 were observed between the two assay results for 151 samples
        following ADVATE*          dosing and 185 samples following rFVIIIFc dosing, respectively.
        Compared to the aPTT results, the chromogenic FVIII activities were, on average, 21% higher for
        ADVATE* and 32% higher for rFVIIIFc, not statistically significant (Figure 9). This observation
        led to a slightly higher estimation of exposure parameters by the chromogenic assessment for both
        drugs. The apparent higher FVIII recoveries by the chromogenic assay are typical for recombinant
        FVIII products tested in clinical assays, and are in agreement with most other marketed FVIII
        products.30 32
[00300]          Improved Pharmacokinetics for rFVIIIFc - The primary PK estimates were derived from
        one-stage (aPTT) clotting assay activity data. In subjects who received 25 or 65 IU/kg of
                                                    - 79 -

ADVATE* followed by an equal dose of rFVIIIFc, the plasma FVIII activity rose sharply and
reached Cm, within the first hour following dosing. The subsequent decline of the observed FVIII
activity exhibited monoexponential decay characteristics until the baseline FVIII activity was
reached (Figure 10). The Cmax increased proportionally to the dose, but was comparable between
equal doses of ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc (Table 8)        The total exposure (AUCINF) also increased
proportionally to the dose. However, the AUCINF of rFVIIIFc was 1.48 and 1.56-fold greater than
that of ADVATE* at 25 IU/kg (p=0.002) and 65 IU/kg (p<0.001), respectively (Table 8).

[00301]                The  t 1/2 , MRT, CL, and Vss appeared to be independent of dose (Table 8). The geometric

           represents a 1.54 and 1.70-fold improvement over that of ADVATE* (12.2 hours and 11.0 hours)
           at equivalent doses (p<0.001), respectively (Table 8). The same intra-subject improvement was
           observed in the MRT of rFVIIIFc (27.0 hours for both dose groups) compared with ADVATE®
           (17.5 hours for the 25 IU/kg and 15.8 hours for the 65 IU/kg) (p<0.001). Consistent with

        significant differences in V,, and incremental recovery between ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc.
        Therefore, within each subject, rFVIIIFc demonstrated an improved PK profile compared with
        ADVATE*. It was also observed that the patients with shorter half-life on ADVATE® had shorter
        half-life on rFVIIIFc, and patients with longer half-life on ADVATE* had longer half-life on
        rFVIIIFc.
[00302]          The improved PK profile of rFVIIIFc resulted in increased time post-dosing to 1% FVIII
        activity which was 1.53 and 1.68-fold longer respectively, than with ADVATE* at 25 IU/kg
        (p<0.001) and 65 IU/kg (p<0.001) (data not shown), suggesting a potentially longer therapeutic
        duration for rFVIIIFc.
[00303]          The favorable PK profile of rFVIIIFc relative to ADVATE* was also demonstrated by
        FVIII activity measured in the chromogenic assay (Table 9), which was comparable to data
        derived from aPTT assays. The estimation of exposure, ie, Cm., and AUCINF, was slightly higher,
        however, based on the chromogenic assay than on the one-stage (aPTT) clotting assay for both
        ADVATE* and rFVIIIFc.

[00304]            Correlation Between von Willebrand Factor and Disposition of rFVIHIFc - Because
          the majority of FVIII in circulation is in complex with VWF 33 and because the genome-wide
          association study has identified that the genetic determinants of FVIII levels are primarily
          dependent on VWF levels,34 we examined the association between VWF and rFVIIIFc. A strong
          correlation was observed between VWF levels and CL and t 1 / 2 for both rFVIIIFc and ADVATE®.
          As shown in Figure 10, as the level of VWF increased, the CL of rFVIIIFc (p=0.0016) and of
          ADVATE* (p=0.0012) decreased.
[003051            The opposite relationship was observed between the level of VWF and t 1 / 2 . As the level of
          VWF increased, the    t 1 /2 of rFVIIIFc (p=0.0003) and of ADVATE* (p<0.0001) increased. This
                                                        -  83 -

        correlation suggests that the Fc moiety of rFVIIIFc does not alter the role of VWF in protecting
        FVIII from clearance.
[003061          Effects of Prolonged PK of rFVIIIFc on Whole Blood ROTEM* - Prior to administration
        of study drug, blood from one subject in each dose group was spiked with an equal dose of
        rFVIIIFc or ADVATE* and analyzed by whole blood ROTEM*. Clotting time (CT) was linear
        with respect to the dose in the range of approximately 1% to 100% of normal, and the dose
        response was comparable between rFVIIIFc and ADVATE* in the same subject (data not shown),
        indicating comparable potency of rFVIIIFc and ADVATE* in clot formation.
[00307]          Despite the variable baseline CT due to residual FVIII levels prior to the administration of
        ADVATE* or rFVIIIFc, both products effectively corrected the CT to comparable levels 30
        minutes post-dosing (Figure 12). The improvement in CT was better sustained by rFVIIIFc than
        ADVATE® after 3 hours following a dose of 25 lU/kg (Figure 12A), and after 24 hours following
        a dose of 65 IU/kg (Figure 12B).
[00308]          rFVIIIFc was well tolerated by subjects at both doses. There were no clinically significant
        changes observed in hematology, blood chemistry, or urinalysis parameters. The majority of AEs
        were mild, unrelated to rFVIIIFc, and resolved without sequelae.        No serious AEs or deaths
        occurred during the study, and no subjects at either dose developed neutralizing or binding
        antibodies to rFVIIIFc.
[00309]          rFVIIIFc demonstrated a significantly improved FVIII activity PK profile relative to
        ADVATE®, with t 1 /2 and MRT across dose levels being 1.54 to 1.71-fold longer, as measured by
        the one-stage (aPTT) clotting assay and 1.59 to 1.84-fold longer by the two-stage chromogenic
        assay. The prolonged activity of rFVIIIFc predicts possible prolonged efficacy, allowing for a less
        frequent dosing regimen in the prophylactic treatment of patients with Hemophilia A.
[00310]          Adopting the PK parameters derived from this study, the Monte Carlo simulation predicts
        that a higher percentage of patients receiving rFVIIIFc will sustain FVIII levels above 1% or 3%
        as compared with patients receiving equal doses of ADVATE* (Table 10). For example, at a dose
        of 25 IU/kg, 12.2% of ADVATE* patients versus 71.2% of rFVIIIFc patients are predicted to
        have FVIII trough levels above 1% on Day 4; at a dose of 65 IU/kg, 11.0% of ADVATE* patients
        versus 66.4% of rFVIIIFc patients are predicted to have FVIII levels above 3% on Day 4. Clinical
        trials in larger numbers of patients are planned to confirm results from this Phase 1/2a study and
        from the Monte Carlo simulation predictions.

[00311]          Despite the success of Fc fusion technology in prolonging circulating    t 1 /2 for a variety of
        protein therapeutics, rFVIII was considered too large to successfully produce dimeric Fc fusions.
        We thus created a monomeric Fc fusion protein whereby a single effector molecule was covalent
        linked to a dimeric Fc, enabling binding to intracellular FcRn and subsequent recycling.'              In
        vitro coagulation assays demonstrate no loss of specific activity for rFVIIIFc, compared to B
        domain deleted or native FVIII, by either clotting or chromogenic assays, using commercially
        available reagents and commonly used FVIII reference standards (JAD, TL, SCL, et al.,
        manuscript submitted August, 2011). In addition, these results indicate that rFVIIIFc can be
        reliably assayed in a clinic setting by either the one-stage assay or the chromogenic method.
[00312]          In summary, this Phase 1/2a clinical trial is the first trial to demonstrate the safety and
        prolonged    t 1/ 2 of rFVIIIFc in patients with severe hemophilia A. A pivotal Phase 3 study is
        ongoing with rFVIIIFc to establish effective prophylaxis dosing regimens for individuals with
        hemophilia A.

[00313]          A novel single-chain (SC) isoform of factor VIII (FVIII), resulting from incomplete
        proteolysis at residue R1648 during biosynthesis, may provide superior manufacturability and
        stability relative to native FVIII.     A single recombinant B domain deleted factor VIII molecule
        fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (rFVIIIFc) and its purified SC counterpart (SC-rFVIIIFc)
                                                       - 85 -

        exhibited similar specific activity in one stage clotting assays using plasma depleted of von
        Willebrand factor (VWF), but SC-rFVIIIFc exhibited lower specific activity in the presence of
        VWF. This study was undertaken to determine if VWF-bound rFVIIIFc, SC-rFVIIIFc and rBDD
        FVIII (XYNTHA*, REFACTO AF*) differ with respect to thrombin-mediated proteolytic release
        from VWF.
[00314]          Equimolar amounts of rFVIIIFc, SC-rFVIIIFc, and rBDD-FVIII were captured on an
        optical biosensor chip on which human VWF had been immobilized by amine coupling. Human
        a-thrombin at a range of concentrations was infused over the chip surface, and the rates of FVIII
        release from immobilized VWF were monitored in real time. The half maximal effective
        concentration (EC5 0 ) of a-thrombin was determined for each FVIII species.
[00315]          a-thrombin EC5 0 values for rFVIIIFc and rBDD-FVIII were comparable (3.7 ± 0.2 U/mL
        and 3.2 ± 0.3 U/mL, respectively), whereas the EC5 0 value for SC-rFVIIIFc was greater than 3
        fold higher (11.7 ± 0.9 U/mL). This finding that SC-rFVIIIFc is released more slowly from VWF
        than are either rFVIIIFc or rBDD-FVIII is consistent with a previously observed finding
        regarding the activities of rFVIIIFc and SC-rFVIIIFc in a one-stage clotting assay (aPTT) in
        which SC-FVIIIFc had a lower apparent activity only when VWF was present in the assay plasma
        sample. However, all samples possessed equivalent activities in a mouse bleeding model,
        indicating that responsiveness of FVIII preparations to thrombin in the release of FVIII from
        VWF does not correlate with efficacy in vivo.
