VEHICLE RECOVERY LADDER
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]      The present invention relates to a vehicle recovery ladder. The present
invention has particular, although not exclusive application to four-wheel drive (4WD)
vehicles.
BACKGROUND
[0002]      The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be
taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of
the common general knowledge.
[0003]      Four-wheel drive (4WD) vehicles invariably become stuck in sand and mud.
Traditionally, shovels were used to dig and extricate stuck 4WD vehicles. Alternatively,
timber could be jammed beneath tyres in an attempt to gain more wheel traction.
[0004]      A known vehicle recovery ladder disclosed in AU 2010100831 provides
improved traction when extricating vehicles. Advantageously, the ladder is light-weight
being molded from polymeric material and includes traction members to assist the
wheel in climbing out of the mire. However, the Applicant has perceived that the traction
members can wear or melt in extreme circumstances, such as the spinning of a wheel,
which can severely hamper the ongoing performance of the ladder.
[0005]      Embodiments of the present invention provide an improved vehicle recovery
ladder.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[00043]     According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a
vehicle recovery ladder 100 as shown in Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c. The ladder includes an
elongate molded body 102, and molded traction members 104 that are releasably
fastened to the body 104. The traction members 104 are bonded to the body 102 with a
chemical and mechanical bond formed during molding. Advantageously, any damaged
traction members 104 can be readily released and replaced to maintain the
performance of the ladder 100.
[00044]     The traction members 104 are normally less durable than a vehicle tyre so as
to sustain damage before the comparatively more expensive tyre. The traction members
104 are formed from polymeric material (e.g. elastomer, polyurethane, thermoplastic,
nylon). The body 102 is also formed from polymeric material (e.g. elastomer,
polyurethane, thermoplastic, nylon). Typically, the body 102 and the traction members
104 are each integrally formed (e.g. injection molded) from the same material.
[00045]     Figure 2 shows four types of traction member 104, namely: novel first,
second and third traction members 104a, 104b 104c; and a conventional traction
member 105 integrally formed with the body 102. In practice, the ladder 100 would
usually consist of a single type of traction member 104a, 104b, or 104c.
[00046]     The traction members 104a, 104b 104c can be clearly seen in Figures 3a,
3b, 4a, 4b, 5a, 5b,respectively. Each traction member 104 includes a rotational release
for rotationally releasing the traction member 104 from the body 102. The rotational
release includes a thread 300. The rotational release also includes a hexagonal tool
recess 302 for receiving a release tool (e.g. Allan key).

                                                 7
[00047]      The ladder 100 includes tongue-in-groove locks for locking the traction
members 104 to the body 102. In particular, each traction member 104a, 104b, 104c
includes an inhibiter 304a, 304b, 304c, respectively, for inhibiting unintentional release
of the traction member 104a, 104b, 104c from the body 102. The inhibiter 304a of the
first traction member 104a is a topside tongue for sitting in a complementary groove of
the body 102. The inhibiter 304b of the second traction member 104b is an underside
groove in which a complementary tongue of the body 102 sits. The inhibiter 304c of the
third traction member 104c is an underside groove in which a complementary tongue of
the body 102 sits.
[00048]       Returning to Figure 2, the traction member 104a is released from the rear or
underside of the ladder 100. Alternatively, the traction members 104b, 104c are
released from the topside of the ladder 100. Each traction member 104a, 104b, 104c
includes a broad skirt 200a, 200b, 200c, respectively, from which a tooth 202a, 202b,
202c upwardly extends. Each tooth is flanked by a pair of support fillets 306 (see. Figs
3a, 4a, 5a). As can best be seen in Figure 2, each traction member 104 is over-molded
by the body 102 to give increased breadth.
[00049]         A method of forming the vehicle recovery ladder 100 is now described.
[00050]      Firstly, the traction members 104a, 104b, 104c are injection molded in a
traction member mold and permitted to set before removal.
[00051]      Next, the set traction members 104a, 104b, 104c are positioned in a ladder
mold.
[00052]      Next, the body 102 is injection molded into the ladder mold, and a chemical
bond forms between the traction members 104a, 104b, 104c (whichever type is used)
and the body 102. A mechanical bond forms with engaging threads of the body 102 and
the threads 300 of the traction members 104a, 104b, 104c, as shown in Fig. 2. As
shown in Figure 2, the body 102 is overmolded over the embedded traction members
104 and forms a complementary thread with the traction members. The traction
members 104 may have a lower melting point than the body 102 to facilitate chemical
bonding between the traction members 104 and the body 102. The chemical bond is
formed by crosslinking of the traction member and body materials.

                                               8
[00053]     In use, the chemical and mechanical bond is broken when releasing the
traction members 104 from the body 102. Another traction member 104 can be
threaded into the body 102 to replace a released traction member 104.
[00054]     Figure 6 shows an alternative tyre traction member 104d, similar to tyre
traction member 104b. A first inhibiter 304d, in the form of an interference blip on the
thread 300, is provided for inhibiting unintentional release of the traction member 104d
from the body 102.
[00055]     Figure 7 shows a pre-formed body 700 which can be used in conjunction with
the tyre traction member 104d. In particular, the body 700 is moulded with receptacles
702 defining internal threads 704. A second inhibiter 706, in the form of an interference
blip on the thread 704 at the top of the receptacle 702, is provided for inhibiting
unintentional release of the traction member 104d from the body 102. Twisting the tyre
traction member 104d tight in the receptacle 702 causes the first and second inhibitors
304d, 706 to yield and allow passage of first inhibitor 304d past the second inhibitor
706. The second inhibitor 706 is then impeded from passing over the first inhibitor 304d
in a reverse direction when untightening the tyre traction member 104d.
[00056]     Figure 8 shows an alternative tyre traction member 104e without a thread.
Instead, the traction member 104e includes a lower retainer 800 from which an upper
tooth 802 extends. The retainer 800 defines apertures 804 through which the polymer
passes during moulding of the body 102 to retain the traction member 104e. The
polymer is also located between the traction member 104e and the retainer 800.
[00057]     As can best be seen in figure 9, the tyre traction member 104e is placed in
the mold and then over-molded with polymer when forming the body 102. The
preformed traction members 104e can be made from durable material (molded polymer,
aluminium, ceramic, silicon rubber, rubber, etc.) and are practically indestructible so that
they will not be damaged and hence need not be replaceable.
[00058]     A person skilled in the art will appreciate that many embodiments and
variations can be made without departing from the ambit of the present invention.
[00059]     For example, the traction members 104 may be formed from metal material
(e.g. metal alloy), ceramic material or rubber material.

                                               9
[00060]     In one embodiment, the traction members 104 may be formed of a different
material to the body 102 to suit the particular application (e.g. hard metal teeth for
military operations). The traction members 104 may be permanently bonded to, and not
releasable from, the body 102.
[00061]     The recess 302 may be pentagonal, octagonal, square, slotted, cross or star
shaped.
[00062]     In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language
more or less specific to structural or methodical features. It is to be understood that the
invention is not limited to specific features shown or described since the means herein
described comprises preferred forms of putting the invention into effect.
