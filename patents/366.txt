                          HITCH PIN AND RECEIVER ASSEMBLY
                                    Field of the Invention
              This is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2014227485, the
 5 entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The invention relates
   to hitch pin and receiver assemblies. In a particular aspect the invention provides a
   hitch pin and receiver assembly that limits relative movement and consequent
   audible rattle.
10                              Background of the Invention
              It is often desirable to carry or tow objects behind a vehicle. A common
   method of transporting such articles is by attaching the object to the vehicle using a
   receiver style hitch. Receiver style hitches mounted to a vehicle provide a strong
   connection      and convenient use for such         purposes as      towing cargo and
15 interconnecting the vehicle to carriers. Conventional receiver trailer hitches typically
   include a female receiver mounted to the vehicle which receives an insert having a
   corresponding shape such that the insert may be slid into the receiver. The receiver
   insert is removably attached to the receiver by a hitch pin which passes through the
   receiver and the insert.
20           A basic form of hitch pin and receiver assembly (see Fig 1) comprises a
   hitch pin with a first end dimensioned or angled to prevent movement through two
   opposed holes in the receiver, and a second opposite end of the hitch pin
   dimensioned to be smaller than the holes. The second end of the hitch pin is inserted
   through each hole (and corresponding holes in the receiver insert) and secured into
25 place by a clip, cotter pin, or similar located toward the second end of the hitch pin.
              The fit between the receiver and the receiver insert is not absolute and often
   results in undesirable free play. The fit between the hitch pin and the receiver is also
   not absolute and may result in additional undesirable free play. The free play,
   whether individual or cumulative, is often audible as an undesirable rattle. As
30 modern vehicles have developed the cabin noise experienced by a driver and/or
   passengers has been reduced, with the result that external rattles are increasingly
   more noticeable and undesirable to consumers.

                                               -2
              Previous attempts have been made at improving the basic hitch pin and
   receiver assembly to prevent or minimise undesirable audible rattle with varying
   degrees of success. Many of the proposed 'anti-rattle'           hitch pin and receiver
   assemblies are complicated and involve additional inserts, small parts, springs and/or
 5 alignment of one or more additional fasteners (see examples depicted in Figs 2a
   and 2b). Disadvantages of the basic form of hitch pin and receiver assembly and
   other attempts at 'anti-rattle' hitch pin and receiver assemblies include that the hitch
   pin clip, inserts, small parts and/or springs may be easily misplaced, lost or dropped
   in snow, sand or grass. Installation at night may require illumination. And installation
10 in unfavourable weather conditions will likely exacerbate any difficulties with
   complex assemblies that require, for example, fiddly alignments and/or multiple
   fasteners. Some of the proposed 'anti-rattle' hitch pin and receiver assemblies may
   also compromise the structural integrity of the connection between the object and the
   vehicle. Further, some of the proposed 'anti-rattle' hitch pin and receiver assemblies
15 are not particularly effective at reducing audible rattle, or are not effective for
   extended journeys.
              It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least
   ameliorate one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art.
20                                Summary of the Invention
              In a first aspect, the present invention provides a hitch pin and receiver
   assembly, comprising:
              a hitch pin having a first end and a second end, including at least one lug
   proximal to the first end, fastening means proximal to the second end and a shaft
25 extending between the at least one lug and the fastening means; and,
              a receiver having two apertures adapted to accommodate the shaft and
   second end of the hitch pin,
              wherein the receiver includes a complementary structure that allows the at
   least one lug of the hitch pin to abut a receiver insert and substantially prevent
30 translational movement of the receiver insert relative to the receiver when the
   fastening means are engaged.

                                                -3
              Engagement of the complementary structure and the at least one lug of the
   hitch pin may also substantially prevent rotation of the hitch pin relative to the
   receiver when the fastening means are engaged.
              It is preferred that the complementary structure is integrally formed in one
 5 of the two apertures in the receiver. Two complementary structures may be integrally
   formed in one of the two apertures in the receiver. In such an arrangement the
   complementary structures may be disposed substantially opposite each other and
   substantially perpendicular to the length of the receiver. Alternatively, the
   complementary structure may be adjacent one of the two apertures in the receiver.
10            The fastening means may comprise a thread about the shaft proximal to the
   second end of the hitch pin and a threaded nut. The fastening means may
   alternatively or additionally comprise an aperture proximal to the second end of the
   hitch pin extending through the shaft adapted to receive a pin or clip. In another
   arrangement, the fastening means may comprise a key-lock. In yet another
15 arrangement, the fastening means may comprise a lock nut.
              The hitch pin may comprise two or more lugs. The hitch pin may include a
   head proximal to the first end. The two apertures in the receiver may be adapted to
   not accommodate the head of the hitch pin.
              In another aspect, the present invention provides a towing assembly kit
20 comprising a hitch pin and receiver assembly according to the first aspect and a
   corresponding receiver insert. Preferably all the parts of the towing assembly kit are
   corrosion resistant.

20                     Description of the Preferred Embodiments
              A hitch pin 301 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention
   is depicted in Figs 3a through 3c. Hitch pin 301 comprises a head 330 proximal to a
   first end 310, a fastening means 340 proximal to a second end 320, and a shaft 360
   extending between the head 330 and the fastening means 340. The hitch pin 301
25 further comprises two lugs 350 (both shown in Fig 3b) proximal to the head 330. A
   hitch pin in accordance with an embodiment of the invention may alternatively
   comprise three lugs as depicted in Figs 13a and 13b.
              The hitch pin may be made of metal, composite or other suitable material or
   a combination of materials. Preferably the hitch pin is made of steel. The hitch pin
30 may be made of 1020 steel, 1030 steel or 1035 steel. More preferably, the hitch pin is
   corrosion resistant. The shaft 360 is generally cylindrical. The shaft may be wholly
   V-3836731:1

                                               -7
   or partly tapered. The head 330 comprises two opposite concave recesses 335 which
   are adapted to facilitate grip of the hitch pin 301.
              The two lugs 350 have a generally elliptical profile. There may only be one
   lug. There may be more than two lugs. Where there are two or more lugs they may
 5 be of different profiles and/or dimensions. The profile of the two lugs 350 runs
   parallel to the shaft 360 and have front edges 355 (labelled in Fig 3b) that abut a
   receiver insert when assembled and the fastening means 340 (discussed below) are
   engaged. Alternatively, the lugs may be partly tapered. In particular, the lugs may
   taper away from the head towards the second end. Tapering of the lugs may assist
10 with assembly. Additionally or alternatively, tapering of the lugs may assist in
   achieving a tight fit between the lug(s) and their complementary structure(s)
   (discussed below) when assembled.
              The fastening means 340 comprises a combination of a thread 345 (location
   indicated, but not depicted - see Figs 10a and 10b) about the shaft 360 proximal to
15 the second end 320 of the hitch pin 301 and an aperture 365 proximal to the second
   end 320 of the hitch pin 301 extending through the shaft 360. The thread 345 is
   adapted to receive a threaded nut (not shown) capable of threadingly engaging the
   thread 345. The aperture 365 is adapted to receive a clip or pin (not shown). The
   fastening means may take other forms. The fastening means may comprise a thread
20 about the shaft proximal to the second end of the hitch pin and a threaded nut without
   an aperture and clip. The fastening means may comprise a key-lock. A key-lock has
   the advantage of additional security.
              Referring to Fig 9b there is depicted the locking end of a key-lock with
   grooves used for locking ball bearings and a sealing O-ring of the locking
25 mechanism depicted in Fig 9a. A hitch pin in accordance with an embodiment of the
   invention with an alternate locking end of a key-lock is depicted in Figs 11 a and 11 b.
   The locking mechanism of Fig 9a contains three ball bearings which are floating in a
   barrel and held captive by another outer cylinder, when the key lock is released the
   outer cylinder retracts, the ball bearings are then able to move away from the centre
30 which allows them to pass over the end of the locking end. When re-locked, the
   cylinder pushes over the ball bearings and forces them inwards again locking them in
   place and the holding the device onto the end of the pin. A hitch pin in accordance
   V-3836731:1

                                               -8
   with an embodiment of the invention with a further alternate locking end of a key
   lock is depicted in Figs 11 a and 11 b. The groove in the thread is adapted to receive
   ball bearings, typically in the form of a ball bearing barrel lock, allowing a single
   piece lock which can be wound on, locked, and then tightened to engage the
 5 fastening means.
             Alternatively, the fastening means may comprise a lock nut. A hitch pin
   comprising two lugs and a lock nut in accordance with an embodiment of the
   invention is depicted in Figs 15a through 15c. The lock nut depicted comprises a
   cylindrical nut with a groove and step along its outer edge. The nut has keyed holes
10 in one end which match up the mirrored key features on a socket. As the nut is
   cylindrical it requires a special matched keyed socket to do up or undo the lock nut
   helping to prevent theft. To further increase theft protection the cylinder may have a
   plastic cover which is free to rotate, this can only be pressed on or removed from the
   nut from the bolt end and so cannot be removed in situ. By being free to rotate
15 wrenches may not be used to grip the nut to unwind it. A hitch pin comprising a lock
   nut as fastening means and receiver assembly (with receiver insert) in accordance
   with an embodiment of the invention is depicted in Figs 16a and 16b.
              A receiver 402 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention
   is depicted in Figs 4a and 4b. Receiver 402 comprises two apertures 470 (only one
20 aperture is shown) and complementary structures 475. The alignment of the apertures
   is shown by the dashed line marked Z. The apertures 470 are adapted to
   accommodate the shaft 360 and second end 320 of the corresponding hitch pin 301
   depicted in Figs 3a through 3c but not the head 330.
              The receiver may be made of metal, composite or other suitable material or
25 a combination of materials. Preferably the receiver is made of steel. The receiver
   may be made of low carbon steel. More preferably, the receiver is corrosion resistant.
   The receiver 402 is 'female' and of rectangular cross-section, which is common in
   the art. However, the receiver may be of a different profile having a corresponding
   shape to the intended receiver insert (see, for example, receiver insert 503 in Fig 5a).
30            The complementary structures 475 are integrally formed in one of the two
   apertures 470 in the receiver 402. The complementary structures 475 are disposed
   substantially opposite each other and substantially perpendicular to the length of the
   V-3836731:1

                                              -9
   receiver 402. As receivers are commonly made of rolled steel joined by a seam
   running the length of the receiver, it is particularly preferred that complementary
   structures integrally formed in an aperture in the receiver are substantially
   perpendicular to the length of the receiver. In alternative embodiments, the
 5 complementary structure(s) may be adjacent the aperture(s). The complementary
   structures 475 are adapted to engage the two lugs 350 of the corresponding hitch pin
   301 depicted in Figs 3a through 3c and allow the two lugs 350 of the hitch pin 301 to
   abut a receiver insert.
              The exploded views in Figs 5a and 5b depict a receiver insert 503, along
10 with receiver 502 and hitch pin 501. The hitch pin 501 and receiver 502 correspond
   to hitch pin 301 depicted in Figs 3a through 3c and receiver 402 depicted in Figs 4a
   and 4c, respectively. Receiver insert 503 is of corresponding rectangular cross
   section to that of receiver 502. Receiver 502 comprises two apertures 580 (only one
   aperture is shown). The alignment of the aperture 580 is shown by the dashed line
15 marked Y. The apertures 580 are adapted to accommodate the shaft 560 and second
   end 520 of the hitch pin 501.
              In order to assemble, receiver insert 503 is inserted into receiver 502 in the
   direction of the arrow marked A until the apertures 580 of the receiver insert 503 line
   up with the apertures 570 of receiver 502. Hitch pin 501 is then inserted into the
20 lined up apertures 570 and 580 of the receiver 502 and receiver insert 503,
   respectively, in the direction of the arrow marked B. In order to complete the
   assembly, hitch pin 501 must be oriented (by rotation, if necessary) with the receiver
   502 such that complementary structures 575 allow lugs 550 to abut the receiver insert
   503, threaded nut 548 is then threadingly engaged with thread 545 (location
25 indicated, but not depicted) in order to engage fastening means 540. In this
   arrangement, when the fastening means (comprising thread 545 and threaded nut
   548) are engaged, lugs 550 are engaged with corresponding complementary
   structures 575 substantially preventing rotation of the hitch pin 501 relative to the
   receiver 502. Engagement of the fastening means also substantially prevents
30 translational movement of the receiver insert 503 relative to the receiver 502.
              Figs 6a through 6e depict various views of an assembled hitch pin 601 and
   receiver 602 assembly with receiver insert 603. Again, the hitch pin 601 and receiver
   V-3836731:1

                                               -10
   602 correspond to hitch pin 301 depicted in Figs 3a through 3c and receiver 401
   depicted in Figs 4a and 4c, respectively, the receiver insert 603 also corresponding to
   that depicted in Figs 5a and 5b.
              In particular, the cross-section view of Fig 6e clearly depicts the shaft 660
 5 and second end 620 of hitch pin 601 (labelled 'anti rattle pull pin') but not the head
   630 accommodated by apertures 670 in receiver 602 (labelled 'hitch box'). Further,
   fastening means (comprising thread 645 - location indicated, but not depicted - and
   threaded nut 648) are engaged and the lugs are engaged in complementary structures
   675 of the left hand aperture of the receiver 602. When the fastening means are
10 engaged, the complementary structures 675 of the left hand aperture of the receiver
   602 allow the front edge of the lugs 655 (labelled 'anti rattle pull pin pulls against the
   edge of the TBM') to abut receiver insert 603 (labelled 'TBM') substantially
   preventing translational movement of the receiver 602 relative to the receiver insert
   603. The engagement of lugs 650 in complementary structures 675 of the left hand
15 aperture 670 of the receiver 602 also substantially prevents rotational movement of
   the hitch pin 601 relative to the receiver 602.
              Hitch pin 601 also provides for additional fastening means by way of an
   aperture 665 (labelled 'R clip hole') proximal to the second end 620 of the hitch pin
   601 extending through the shaft 660 adapted to receive a clip (not shown).
20            The hitch pin 701 in accordance with an alternate embodiment of the
   invention in Figs 7a through 7c comprises a head 730 proximal to a first end 710, a
   fastening means 740 proximal to a second end 720, and a shaft 760 extending
   between the head 730 and the fastening means 740. The hitch pin 701 further
   comprises one lug 750 proximal to the head 730. The head 730 is rounded to
25 minimise protrusion when assembled.
              The fastening means 740 comprises a combination of a thread 745 (location
   indicated, but not depicted) and an aperture 765 extending through the shaft 760. The
   thread 745 is adapted to receive a threaded nut (not shown) capable of threadingly
   engaging the thread 745. The aperture 765 is adapted to receive a clip (not shown).
30            The receiver 802 in accordance with an alternate embodiment of the
   invention in Figs 8a and 8b comprises two apertures 870 (only one aperture is
   shown) and complementary structure 875 to engage the lug 750 of the corresponding
   V-3836731:1

                                              - 11
   hitch pin 701 depicted in Figs 7a through 7c. The alignment of the apertures 870 is
   shown by the dashed line marked Z. The apertures 870 are adapted to accommodate
   the shaft 760 and second end 720 of the corresponding hitch pin 701 depicted in Figs
   7a through 7c but not the head 730.
 5            An additional feature of the receiver 802 (and the receiver 402 depicted in
   Figs 4a and 4b) is that it may be reverse-compatible with a basic hitch pin. Therefore,
   in the event that the corresponding hitch pin in accordance with the present invention
   is, for example, misplaced, a basic hitch pin will enable a secure connection to a
   vehicle.
10            An additional feature of aspects of the present invention is that it may be
   compatible with a weight distribution receiver insert (a receiver with a series of
   apertures along its length) or a solid receiver insert, whereas some other 'anti-rattle'
   hitch, particularly 'J-Pin' arrangements, are not so compatible.
              In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, where the fastening
15 means comprises a removable element, that element may comprise at least one lug
   that abuts a receiver insert and substantially prevents translational movement of the
   receiver insert relative to the receiver when the fastening means are engaged. For
   example, where the fastening means comprises a thread about the shaft proximal to
   the second end of the hitch pin and a removable threaded nut, as depicted in Figs 18a
20 and 18b, the threaded nut may comprise two lugs and the first end of the hitch pin
   may be hexagonal and adapted to receive a spanner or the like in order to engage the
   fastening means. In a further example, depicted in Fig 19, the fastening means may
   comprise a removable washer comprising two lugs. In an alternative arrangement, a
   washer comprising at least one lug may be adapted to be positioned proximal to the
25 first end of a hitch pin. Arrangements of the present invention utilising a washer
   comprising at least one lug are less preferred as the washer may require an increased
   clamp load, relative to other preferred embodiments, to avoid loosening over time.
              As can be seen from the foregoing description of the preferred and alternate
   embodiments, it is plain that the present invention may incorporate one or more of
30 the following advantages over the basic form of hitch pin and receiver assembly and
   previous attempts at other 'anti-rattle' hitch pin and receiver assemblies:

              -       minimal relative rotational and translational movement and little or
                      no consequent audible rattle;
              -        ease and speed of installation;
              -       simple robust design;
 5            -       receiver is reverse-compatible with a basic hitch pin; and
              -        compatibility with weight distribution receiver insert.
             Although preferred forms of the present invention have been described, it
   will be apparent to persons skilled in the art that modifications can be made to the
   preferred and alternate embodiments described above or that the invention can be
10 embodied in other forms.
              Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the
   context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises"
   and "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or
   step or group of integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or
15 group of integers or steps.
              The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information
   derived from it), or to any matter which is known is not, and should not be taken as
   an acknowledgment or admission or any form of suggestion that that prior
   publication (or information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the
20 common general knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification
   relates.
