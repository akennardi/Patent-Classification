Abstract
A method of encrypting sensor input entries for passcode entry security is disclosed.
The method in one embodiment includes presenting a passcode entry interface on an
electronic device for a user to input a passcode entry. The electronic device then
receives an input event, which is indicative of at least part of the passcode entry by
the user, from a sensor of the electronic device. The electronic device then encrypts
a sensor value of the input event and transmits the encrypted sensor value to an
external system over a network to cause the external system to decipher the passcode
entry from the encrypted sensor value.

                                             BACKGROUND
   [00021           Security in accessing and transmitting information is as crucial as security to
   protect physical possessions. Conventional security devices, such as number locks, may
10 include devices that control access based on possession of a virtual "key," such as in the form
   of private information (e.g., a passeode). A passcode is a combination of a sequence of
   characters, such as letters, numbers, special characters, or any combination thereof In the
   digital realm, passcode-based locks are emulated by digital passcode-based security devices,
   such as by an automatic teller machine (ATM) key pad or a debit card personal identification
15 number (PIN) key pad. These digital passcode-based security devices are generally
   specialized hardware devices (i.e., lacking a general purpose operating system/kernel to run
   different functional components) that control access to a system based on a user's knowledge
   of a passcode. Conventional digital passcode-based security devices are implemented on
   specialized devices because, among other reasons, any general-purpose device may enable
20 installations of malware (i.e., software design for the purpose of overcoming security without
   authorization).
   [00031          For example, in a conventional point-of-sale electronic payment card
   transaction, e.g., by a debit card or smart card such as a Europay, MasterCard, and Visa
   (EMV) card, a cardholder's identity and/or authenticity is confirmed by requiring an entry of
25 a P IN rather than or in addition to signing a paper receipt. A user may enter a PIN on a
   specialized card reader. The card reader can then retrieve a PIN from the smart card. The
   PIN entered by a user can be compared against the retrieved PIN from the smart card.
   Authorization of the use of the card can be granted based on the entered PIN matching the
   retrieved PIN.

   [0004]           The example above uses a specialized device to authorize a user instead of a
   general-purpose device, which has an operating system enabling any third party application
   to run thereon. A general-purpose device enables ease of implementation of security
   sensitive applications. Ability to use general-purpose devices enables merchants and
 5 consumers, who wish to use or implement a secure authentication system, to use devices they
   already own for that purpose. However, making the card reader part of a general-purpose
   device may be unfeasible because of inability to defend adequately against malware's
   installation on the same general-purpose device. One particular form of malware that may be
   of concern in this context is malware that performs a static analysis of a payment
10 authentication application on the general-purpose device; for example, such malware may
   have the ability to read the memory used by the payment authentication application. When
   the general-purpose device processes and stores a consumer's PIN, the general-purpose
   device may expose the PIN to discovery by malware of this type.

   100131           The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes
30 of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following
                                                     2

   discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may
   be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.
                                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   100141          A technique to secure passcode entry on an electronic device is disclosed
 5 herein. The technique involves encrypting raw input events from an input device of an
   electronic device. A complete passcode entry may produce multiple raw input events, such
   as multiple touch events on a touch screen. In such instances, each raw input may represent
   the location of a touch event on a touch screen, and each event representing a touch location
   is encrypted. Thus, encryption of individual input events serves as a measure to prevent
10 unauthorized discovery (e.g., by malware) of the passcode.
   [0015]          The disclosed technique can be advantageous, because no application memory
   of the electronic device contains the fully deciphered passcode; consequently, this technique
   prevents malware from discovering the passcode by static analysis of an application memory
   space on the electronic device. Furthermore, the input events indicative of the passcode can
15 be encrypted at a kernel-level to prevent malware running on a user-application level of the
   operating system from logging the raw input events prior to encryption and to prevent any
   analysis to reverse-engineer the passcode based on a known passcode interface configuration.
   100161          In various embodiments, the encryption is based on public-key cryptography,
   requiring two separate keys, one of which is private/secret as held by the trusted computing
20 system used for decryption and one of which is public as known to the electronic device used
   for encryption. Other encryption methods may be used instead of or in conjunction with the
   disclosed technique, including various symmetric and/or asymmetric encryption algorithms,
   such as the RSA encryption scheme with the Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding
   (RSAES-OAEP) standard or white box cryptography.
25 [00171          The raw input events can be touch events as recorded by a touch screen of the
   electronic device. A passcode interface, such as a PIN or key pad, may be displayed on the
   touch screen. The user may enter the passcode entry for authentication on the touch screen.
   The electronic device may encrypt the touch events resulting from the interaction with the
   touchscreen. The electronic device may then transmit the encrypted touch events represented
30 by touch screen coordinates to a trusted computing system to cause the trusted computing
   system to decipher the passcode, as entered by the user, based on the encrypted touch events.
                                                   3

   "To cause"' in this context is intended to include sending a command, a request, or any other
   type of message or signal that results in the stated action, such as deciphering the passcode
   based on the encrypted touch events.
   [00181          In various embodiments, only the trusted computing system performs the
 5 transformation from the encrypted raw input events into the passcode entry. Instead of
   deciphering the passcode entry on the electronic device, the input events are sent to the
   trusted computing system for interpretation. The trusted computing system, which may be
   external to the electronic device, can then decrypt each input event to decipher the passcode
   entered by the user.
10 [0019]          Deciphering of the passcode may include comparing the decrypted touch event
   to a passcode interface configuration. For example, the passcode interface configuration may
   be or include a key pad layout, which can be represented as a data structure or object. As a
   more specific example, the key pad layout can be generated by the trusted computing system
   and sent to the electronic device for presentation. As another specific example, the key pad
15 layout can be generated by the electronic device, and sent to the trusted computing system for
   deciphering. Either way, the trusted computing system may use the passcode interface
   configuration, e.g., key pad layout, to map sensor input events to a sequence of characters
   used to compose the passcode entry.
   [0020]          The key pad layout may include geometry, position, relative position,
20 animation sequence, or other variations of the presentation of the key pad. The key pad may
   include multiple buttons taking up regions of the touch screen of the electronic device. Each
   touch event may be represented by an (X,Y) location coordinate, where each coordinate or set
   of coordinates is encrypted in accordance with various embodiments of the disclosed
   technique. The passeode can then be deciphered by mapping each (X,Y) coordinate to a two
25 dimensional space corresponding to a specific soft-button representing a character used to
   compose a passcode entry.
   [00211          As another specific example, the raw input events can be touch events as
   recorded by a camera or an accelerometer of the electronic device. A nalware application
   may potentially use other sensor inputs to derive the passcode entry through the passcode
30 interface. Accordingly, the electronic device may encrypt the raw input events of various
   other sensors of the electronic device as well, to provide an extra security layer in preventing
   reverse engineering of the passcode.
                                                    4

   [0022]           In the above examples, both the presentation device of the passcode interface
   and the input device are exemplified as a touch screen. However, an audio-based passcode
   interface is contemplated as well. For example, the sensor input event may be vocalized
   syllables, words, phrases ("sound bites") as recorded by a microphone. The passcode
 5 interface configuration may include the valid vocalized sound bites that may combined in
   sequence into a passcode entry.
   [00231           FIG. I is a data flow diagram illustrating a technique 100 of sensor entry
   encryption. As shown, the technique 100 involves an electronic device 102 and an
   authentication system 104. The electronic device 102 may be a general purpose device with
10 data processing capabilities. For example, the electronic device 102 may be a mobile phone,
   a tablet, an e-reader, other mobile or portable computing devices, or other stationary
   computing devices. The authentication system 104 may be a trusted computing system in
   data communications with the electronic device 102, such as over a network,. The
   authentication system 104 may be one or more computing devices. For example, the
15 authentication system 104 may be a server computer, a network of computing systems, a
   cloud computing environment, a virtualized computing environment, or any combination
   thereof. Communication between the authentication system 104 and the electronic device
    102 may be any form of data communication, including mobile teleconmunication (e.g.,
   cellular), WiFi, wireless Ethernet, wired Ethernet, or any other form of Internet connection.
20 100241           The electronic device 102 may be a mobile device, such as a smartphone or a
   tablet computer, that presents a passcode interface 106 on an output device. In the illustrated
   embodiment, the output device is a touch screen 108, A user seeking authentication may
   input through a sensor (i.e. an input device) of the electronic device 102, a series of inputs
   composing a passcode, such as a PIN, a passphrase, a digital key, or any combination thereof.
25 In the illustrated embodiment, the sensor is the touch screen 108. Note, however, that the
   sensor (e.g., a touch panel or a cursor device) for detecting an input may be different fr-om the
   output device (e.g., a display, a projection device, a speaker, or other devices capable of
   presenting the passcode interface 106).
   100251           The sensor entries 110 together form a sensor input stream 114, such as a
30 touch event stream. The sensor input stream 114 is a sequence of sensor entries. The sensor
   input stream 114 may be associated with a single user, a single session, a single application,
   or any combination thereof When the passcode interface 106 is presented on the touch
                                                    5

   screen 108 and the user enters input at the passcode interface 106, the electronic device 102
   captures and interprets the sensor input stream 114.
   [00261           As each sensor entry 110 is captured by the sensor, the sensor entry 110 is
   routed to an operating system of the electronic device 102 for processing. The sensor entries
 5  110 may be encrypted at any level along this data route. The data route propagates through a
   software stack of the electronic device 102 as illustrated in FIG. 4. The encryption may be
   based on asymmetric, symmetric, or white box cryptography. The encryption may occur at
   any of various different levels of the software stack as illustrated in FIG. 4. Once the sensor
   entries are encrypted, the electronic device 102 may send the encrypted sensor entry 110
10 directly over to tlie authentication system 104.
   100271           In various embodiments, a portion of the sensor input stream 114 is sent to the
     authentication system 104 for deciphering. In various embodiments, when the authentication
   system 104 receives the portion of the sensor input stream 114, the authentication system 104
   may decrypt the sensor entries 110 prior to deciphering the passcode entry 116 by the user. A
15 passcode interface configuration 118, which defines the mechanism of interaction with the
   passcode interface, may be generated by the electronic device 102 and then sent over to the
   authentication system 104 as well. The passcode interface configuration may specify a
   mapping between sensor values of the sensor entries and a set of characters used to compose
   a passcode entry As an example, where the passcode interface is displayed on the touch
20 screen 108, the passcode interface configuration may include geometric definition of the
   passcode interface on the touch screen 108. In other embodiments, the passcode interface
   configuration is generated by the authentication system 104. The passcode interface
   configuration may be generated specifically for a session with a user interacting with the
   passcode entry interface.
25  100281          In various embodiments, the portion of the sensor input stream 114 is
   interpreted to produce a passcode entry 116 by comparing the sensor input stream 114 to a
   known passcode interface configuration 118. The authentication system 104 can decipher
   which character or set of characters corresponds to the decrypted sensor entries. The
   authentication system 104 can then aggregate the deciphered characters or sets of characters
30 in sequence into a passcode entry 116. The passcode entry 116 corresponds to the passcode
   entered by the user in response to the presentation of the passcode interface.
   [00291           This technique can be applied, for example, in financial transaction
   authentication processes. To authenticate a user via a passcode entry, the passcode entry 116
                                                    6

   can be compared against an authentic passcode corresponding to an authorized user. For
   example, the authentic passcode is stored in a financial service system 120. In some
   embodiments, the financial service system 120 includes the authentication system 104. In
   some embodiments, the deciphering of the passcode entry 116 is performed by modules on
 5 the electronic device 102 instead of by the authentication system 104.
   100301          The authorized user and the authentic passcode may be associated with a
   payment card identity 122. The payment card identity 122 may correspond to a debit card or
   a credit card. In the illustrated example, the payment card identity 122 is stored on a payment
   card 124. The payment card identity 122 is extracted via a card reader 126. The card reader
10  126 is coupled to the electronic device 102, such as via a wired interconnect or wirelessly.
   The payment card identity 122 and other non-passcode related data are transferred to the
   electronic device 102. In various embodiments, the payment card identity 122 and other non
   passcode related data are encrypted. The payment card identity 122 and other non-passcode
   related data are then shared with the authentication system 104. Based on the payment
15 identity 120 and the passcode entry 116, the authentication system 104 communicates with
   the financial service system 120 to confirm the identity and the authorization of the user, such
   as the payment of the user.
   [00311          In other embodiments, the authentic passcode is be stored on the payment card
    124. For example, an EMV credit card includes an integrated circuit (IC) chip 130
20 containing the authentic passcode associated with the user of the EM V credit card.
   Authorization of the user to use the EMV credit card may require a comparison of the
   passcode entry 116 and the authentic passcode on the IC chip 130 of the EMV credit card.
   Hence, the authentication system 104 may send the passcode entry 116 to the electronic
   device 102 once the passcode entry 116 is deciphered. The passcode entry 116 sent back to
25 the electronic device 102 may be encrypted as well. The passcode entry 116 can then be sent
   to the IC chip 130 for comparison.
   [00321          While the illustrated embodiment contemplates the sensor entries as touch
   events on a touch screen and the passcode interface as a key pad displayed on the touch
   screen, note that the passcode interface does not have to be integral with the sensor device.
30 For example, the sensor may be a vibration sensor, an accelerometer, an optical sensor, a
   camera, a tactile sensor, or other means of detecting a user's interaction with the passcode
   interface displayed on a screen of the electronic device.
                                                   7

   [0033]          Also contemplated is a passcode interface that is riot solely visual based. In
   that regard, other examples of types of sensor events where the disclosed technique can apply
   include voice entry (e.g., input via recognition), gesture entry (e.g., via gesture recognition),
   vibration entry, eye tracking, or other methods of direct or indirect user input. For example,
 5 the passcode interface may be a combination of a visual interface displayed on a screen and
   an audio interface. The audio interface can include auditory instructions through a speaker
   and/or auditory input through a microphone. For example, the sensor entry may be a voice
   entry to a microphone, while the passcode interface is a user interface capable of receiving
   input through voice entry.
10 [0034]          FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an electronic device 200, which may
   represent device 102 in FIG. 1, for passcode entry. The electronic device 200 may be a
   general-purpose computing device. The electronic device 200 includes various modules and
   storage as described below. The electronic device 200 includes a passcode interface module
   202, which is configured to present and maintain a passcode interface.
15  100351         In various embodiments, the passcode interface module 202 is configured to
   generate the passcode interface. The passcode interface module 202 may generate the
   passcode interface randomly or pseudo-random ly. As an example, the passcode interface
   may be configured as a PIN pad layout. The size, arrangement, position, orientation, shape,
   and other absolute or relative geometric characteristics of the passcode interface and elements
20 within the passcode interface are all examples of the passcode interface configuration. The
   passcode interface configuration may be selected to promote concealment of a user's entry of
   a passcode on the passcode interface.      For example, the elements on the passcode interface
   may be characters from which the passcode combination (e.g., the passcode entry 116) may
   be chosen. The arrangement of the characters and the geometric shapes and sizes of the
25 characters may be randomized. Other attributes of the passcode interface configuration may
   be wholly or partially randomly generated. The passcode interface configuration, such as the
   absolute and relative (e.g., relative to a display of the electronic device 200) geometric
   characteristics of the passcode interface, may be stored in an interface configuration store
   204.
30 [0036]          In other embodiments, the passcode interface configuration is provided by a
   remote system through a network, such as the authentication system 104 of FIG. 1. For
   example, the passcode interface configuration may be received through an authentication
   communication module 206. In those embodiments, once received, the passcode interface
                                                     8

   configuration may be stored in the interface configuration store 204. The passcode interface
   configuration may then be used by the passcode interface module 202 to present the passcode
   interface to the user.
   [00371          When the passcode interface configuration is generated on the electronic
 5 device 200, the authentication communication module 206 may transmit the passcode
   interface configuration to the remote system such that the remote system may use a portion of
   the sensor input stream and the passcode interface configuration to decipher the passcode
   entry.
   [00381          The passcode interface module 202 may further be configured to present the
10 passcode interface in a variety of ways. As an example, the presentation of the passcode
   interface may include displaying or rendering the passcode interface on a touch screen in
   accordance with the passcode interface configuration, such as a layout configuration. The
   passcode interface module 202 may render the passcode interface in a two-dimensional or
   three-dimensional manner. The passcode interface module 202 may also present the
15 passcode interface in other ways, including presenting the passeode interface through
   animation, audio, webpage, widget, other passive or interactive multimedia, or any
   combination thereof
   [00391          The passcode interface module 202 may be configured to maintain feedback
   based on an interactivity between the passcode interface and a user. For example, the
20 passcode interface module 202 may be coupled to a touch screen of the electronic device 200,
   such as the touch screen 108 of FIG. 1. The interactivity enables the passcode interface to
   provide feedback as a user enters a character or a set of character to be part of the passcode
   entry
   100401           A record of interactivity is captured with an input device 205, such as the
25 touch screen 108 of FIG. 1. The input device 205 is controlled by an input device driver 208
   of the electronic device 200. The input device driver 208 may run on a kernel level of an
   operating system of the electronic device 200.
   [00411           In various embodiments, the input device driver 208 captures an input stream
   from the input device 205. The input device 205 may include any input hardware (i.e., one or
30 more sensors) capable of detecting an sensor entry which implicates (i.e., indicative of) a
   user's interaction with the passeode interface. The sequence of sensor entries received may
   constitute the input stream.
                                                     9

   [0042]          The electronic device 200 includes an encryption module 210. The encryption
   module 2110 receives the input stream directly or indirectly from the input device driver 208.
   For example, the encryption module 210 may access a driver buffer of the input device driver
   208 containing the input stream. As another example, the encryption module 2 10 may
 5 respond to an interrupt raised by the input device driver 208 on the kernel level of the
   operating system. As yet another example, the encryption module 210 may be part of an
   operating system level library of which interfaces with the drivers on one end and with user
   level applications on another.
   [00431          The encryption module 210 is configured to encrypt sensor entries of the input
10 stream. In some embodiments, the encryption module 210 encrypts each sensor entry
   separately. In other embodiments, a set of sensor entries are encrypted together. In some
   embodiments, content values and/or metadata values of each sensor entry are separately
   encrypted. For example, where the sensor entries are touch events from a touch screen, a
   location, including X and Y coordinates of each touch screen may be encrypted. As another
15 example, the X and Y coordinates may be encrypted separately.
   [00441          The authentication communication module 206 is configured to request a
   sensor input stream from a system call interface module 212 of the electronic device 200.
   The system call interface module 212 may be part of an operating system kernel of the
   electronic device 200. The system call interface module 212 may respond to the request by
20 retrieving the sensor input stream from the encryption module 210. In various embodiments,
   the encryption module 210 may be integral with the system call interface module 212, where
   the encryption module 210 may encrypt the sensor entries dynamically upon request from the
   authentication communication module 206 and/or other applications.
   100451          In response to receiving the sensor input stream, the authentication
25 communication module 206 sends a portion of the encrypted sensor input stream to an
   external authentication system, such as the authentication system 104 of FIG. 1, through a
   network. The portion may be selected from sensor entries recorded while presenting the
   passcode interface on the electronic device 200.
   100461          Although FIG. 2 illustrates the encryption module 210 as encrypting the
30 sensor entries between the input device driver 208 and the system call interface module 212.,
   other embodiments are contemplated in this disclosure as well. For example, the encryption
   module     10 and the system call interface module 212 may be integrated into a single
   program. As another example, the encryption module 210 and the input device driver 208
                                                   10

   may be integrated into a single program. As yet another example, the encryption module 210
   and the authentication communication module 206 may be integrated into a single program.
   [00471           The interface configuration store 204 described can be implemented in one or
   more hardware memory components or portions of the hardware memory components. The
 5 interface configuration store 204 can be implemented as a dynamic database service or a
   static data structure. The store can be implemented by a single physical device or distributed
   through multiple physical devices. The storage space of the store can be allocated at run-time
   of the modules described above, such as the passcode interface application 202.
   [00481           FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an authentication system 300. As
10 shown, the authentication system 300 includes a device communication module 302
   configured to communicate with an electronic device, such as the electronic device 200 of
   FIG. 2. For example, the device communication module 302 may receive a sensor input
   sequence, such as a touch event sequence, from an electronic device, such as the electronic
   device 200. In various embodiments, the sensor entries within the sensor input sequence are
15 encrypted.
   [00491           The authentication system 300 includes a decryption module 304. The
   decryption module 304 is configured to decrypt the encrypted sensor entries within the sensor
   input sequence. The decryption methodology in the authentication system 300 may
   correspond to any encryption methodology im plemented on the electronic device, such as in
20 accordance with the cryptography mechanisms described for the encryption module 210. For
   example, the decryption methodology may be in accordance with asymmetric, symmetric, or
   white box cryptography.
   [00501           In some embodiments, the decryption module 304 and/or the cryptography
   module 306 are implemented as a hardware component. The hardware component may
25 adapted to prevent external access from any external application (e.g., malware application),
   which otherwise may have gained access to the authentication system 300. This is
   advantageous to provide an additional layer of security against would-be attackers attempting
   to discover a user's passcode.
   100511           The cryptography key used for decryption can be stored in and retrieved from
30 a cryptography module 306. The cryptography module 306 is configured to manage
   encryption keys (e.g., public or private key) used for encryption on the electronic device and
   for decryption on the authentication system 300. In various embodiments, the cryptography
                                                   11

   module 306 assigns an encryption key to the electronic device by transmitting the encryption
   key through the device communication module 302.
   [00521          The authentication system 300 includes a decipher module 308. The decipher
   module 308 is configured to decipher a passcode entry from a user based on a sensor input
 5 sequence. For example, the decipher module 308 may receive the decrypted sensor input
   sequence from the decryption module 304. In some embodiments, the decipher module 308
   also receives a passcode interface configuration from the electronic device through the device
   communication module 302. In other embodiments, the decipher module 308 accesses a
   known passcode interface configuration (not shown) that is stored on the authentication
10 system 300.
   100531          The decipher module 308 may determine a passcode entry by a user based on
   the decrypted sensor input sequence and the passcode interface configuration. For example,
   where the passcode interface is a keypad and the sensor input sequence are touch events, the
   decipher module 308 may map the touch coordinates of the touch events to known character
15 elements arranged on the keypad. The sequence of interpreted character elements may then
   be deciphered to be the passcode entry by the user.
   [00541          The passcode entry may be passed back to the electronic device through the
   device communication module 302 to be verified, such as to be verified by a card reader
   attached to the electronic device. The passcode entry may also be passed out to a financial
20 service system to be verified through a financial service communication module 310. The
   financial service communication module 310 is configured to communicate with an external
   financial service system, such as the financial service system 120 of FIG. 1.
   [00551          One or more modules on the electronic device 200 may be implemented on the
   authenti cation system 300 and one or more modules of the authentication system 300 may be
25 implemented on the electronic device 200. For example, the cryptography module 306 of the
    authentication system 300 may be implemented on the electronic device 200, where the
   encryption key and decryption key are distributed from the electronic device 200 to the
   authentication system 300.
   100561          FIG. 4 is a system architecture diagram of an electronic device 400, such as
30 the electronic device 102 or the electronic device 200, illustrating a data path through which a
   sensor entry may be processed. The electronic device 400 includes a sensor device 402 that
   can record a sequence or a stream of sensor entries, such as coordinates of a detected touch
   on a touch screen ("touch events"), at a hardware level 404. The hardware level 404 includes
                                                   12

   at least a physical hardware component of the electronic device 400 that is either coupled to
   the electronic device 400 or integral to the electronic device. The sensor device 402 may be a
   touch screen, for example. The sensor device 402 may include a sensor controller 406. The
   sensor controller 406, for example, can be a specialized integrated circuit for controlling one
 5 or more sensors within the sensor device 402. The sensor controller 406, for example, can be
   a field programmable gate array (FPGA) , a programmable microcontroller, or an application
   specific IC (ASIC). The sensor controller 406 may execute a sensor firnware 408.
   Operations of the sensor firmware 408 may be considered to be within a firmware level 410
   of the system architecture.
10 [0057]          The sensor firrnware 408 or the sensor controller 406 may transmit the sensor
   entry to a sensor device driver 412 at a kernel level 414 of the system architecture. The
   sensor device driver 412 may be coupled to a driver buffer 416, which is a memory space to
   store incoming sensor inputs. The sensor entry received by the sensor device driver 412 may
   be stored in the driver buffer 416. The sensor device driver 412 is a computer program that
15 operates or controls the sensor device 402 on behalf of an operating system 418 of the
   electronic device 400. The sensor device driver 412 may communicate with the sensor
   controller 406 or the sensor firmware 408 through a bus or other wired or wireless
   communication system.
   [0058]           As shown in FIG. 4, the operating system 418 running on the electronic device
20 400 includes a kernel program 420. The kernel program 420 is a computing program that
   manages input/output requests from software running on the electronic device 400, and
   translates the requests into data processing instructions for a central processing unit (CPU)
   and/or other electronic components of the electronic device 400. For example, the kernel
   program 420 may serve as a system call interface service to a passcode authentic cation
25 application 422 running on a user level 424 of the operating system 418. The kernel program
   420 enables certain programs including device drivers (e.g., the sensor device driver 412) to
   run on the kernel level 414 with different privileges and/or constraints compared an
   application on the user level 424. Modules running on the kernel level 414 may have higher
   execution privileges, have separate address spaces, have parallel execution threads (e.g.
30 instead of sequential execution), have the capability of interrupt based processes, can shared
   data with each other, can be pre-emptible, or any combination thereof.
   [0059]          The passcode authentication application 422, such as the authentication
   communication module 206 of FIG. 2, may communicate with the sensor device driver 412
                                                   13

   through the kernel program 420. For example, the passcode authentication application 422
   may access the sensor entries in the sensor input stream provided by the sensor device 402.
   [00601          Encryption of the sensor entries in the sensor input stream may occur at the
   firmware level 410, the kernel level 414, the user level 424, or a combination thereof The
 5 encrypted sensor entries are advantageous in protecting against malware running either on the
   kernel level 414 or the user level 424. In various embodiments, while an encryption key is
   provided on the electronic device, a decryption key is not known to the electronic device. In
   other embodiments, a symmetric key is used for both encryption and decryption. In those
   cases, the symmetric key and the encryption algorithm are mathematically composed as a
10 data object (e.g., a block of code or a compiled binary) from which an attacker cannot
   determine the original symmetric key without significant effort.
   [00611          FIG. 5 illustrates a flow chart of a process 500 of operating an electronic
   device (e.g., the electronic device 102, the electronic device 200 or the electronic device 400)
   to encrypt a sensor value implicating a user input to a passcode entry interface. The
15 electronic device presents a passcode code interface on a display, such as a touch screen, for a
   user to input a passcode entry at a step 502. For example, the passcode entry interface
   presented niay be a keypad for authenticating a user for payment to/from a financial service
   system. Step 502 may be perfonned by the passcode entry interface module 202. The
   passcode entry interface niay be presented in response to initiation of a financial transaction
20 on the electronic device, such as when a card reader, coupled to the electronic device, detects
   a swipe of a payment card by a user.
   [00621          A sensor input stream from a sensor of the electronic device is received at step
   504. The sensor entries from the sensor input stream may be represent or be indicative of a
   user's interaction with the passcode entry interface. For example, the sensor input stream can
25 be a touch event stream from a touch screen of the electronic device. Each touch event may
   include a coordinate of where a touch has been detected by the touch screen. Step 504 may
   be performed by the input device driver 208.
   [0063]          Next, the electronic system encrypts a sensor value of an input event from the
   sensor input stream at step 506. The sensor value may be encrypted along with metadata of
30 the input event entry. Where multiple sensor values are collected in a single input event entry
   (e.g., x-coordinate and a y-coordinate of a touch event), the multiple sensor values may be
   encrypted together. In some implementations, multiple sensor entries may be encrypted in
   batch, such as multiple touch locations (e.g., multiple sets of x-coordinate and y-coordinate).
                                                   14

   Step 506 may be performed by the encryption module 210 and may be performed on a kernel
   level of the electronic device.
   [00641          The electronic device can then transmit the encrypted sensor value to an
   external system over a network at step 508. The encrypted sensor value may be transmitted
 5 as a command, a request, or any other type of message or signal that causes the external
   system to decipher the passcode from the encrypted sensor value. The external system may
   be the authentication system 300 of FIG. 3 for deciphering the passcode from the encrypted
   sensor value and authenticating the user based on the passcode. Step 508 may be performed
   by the authentication communication module 206.
10 [0065]          FIG. 6 illustrates a flow chart of a process 600 of operating a computing
   system (e.g., the authentication system 300 of FIG. 3) for deciphering a passcode by a user.
   The computing system receives encrypted sensor input values from an electronic device, such
   as the electronic device 102, the electronic device 200 or the electronic device 400, at step
   602. In various embodiments, the sensor input values correspond to user interactions with a
15 passcode entry interface presented on the electronic device. The encrypted sensor input
   values may correspond to a period when the passcode entry interface is presented on the
   electronic device. Step 602 may be performed by the device communication module 302 of
   FIG. 3.
   [0066]          Next, the computing system decrypts sensor values from the encrypted sensor
20 input values at step 604. The decrypted sensor values may be used to determine user input
   events with the passeode entry interface. Step 604 may be performed by the decryption
   module 304 of FIG. 3.
   [00671          Once decrypted, the computing system accesses an interface configuration of
   the passcode entry interface at step 606. The interface configuration may specify a mapping
25 between the sensor input values and the set of characters used to compose a passcode entry,
   such as the characters composing the passcode entry corresponding to the sensor input values.
   The interface configuration may be generated on the computing system or on the electronic
   device. The interface configuration may be generated specifically for a session with the user
   interacting with the passcode entry interface.
30 [0068]          Based on the interface configuration and the decrypted sensor input values of
   the user input events, the computing system deciphers the passcode entry entered by the user
   at step 608. Step 606 and step 608 may be performed by the decipher module 306 of FIG. 3.
                                                   15

   [0069]          Regarding the process 500 and the process 600, while the various steps, blocks
   or sub-processes are presented in a particular order, alternative embodiments may perform
   routines having steps, or employ systems having steps, blocks or sub-processes, in a different
   order, and some steps, sub-processes or blocks may be deleted, moved, added, subdivided,
 5 combined, and/or modified to provide alternative or subcombinations. Each of these steps,
   blocks or sub-processes may be implemented in a variety of different ways. Also, while
   steps, sub-processes or blocks are at times shown as being performed in series, some steps,
   sub-processes or blocks may instead be performed in parallel, or may be performed at
   different times as will be recognized by a person of ordinary skill in the art. Further any
10 specific numbers noted herein are only examples.
   100701          FIG. 7 is a block diagram of a passcode entry system 700 including an
   electronic device 702 (e.g., the electronic device 200 of FIG. 2) and an authentication system
   704 (e.g,, the authentication system 300 of FIG. 3). Note that the architecture shown in FIG.
   7 is only one example architecture of the passcode entry system 700, and that the electronic
15 device 702 could have more or fewer components than shown, or a different configuration of
   components. The various components shown in FIG. 7 can be implemented by using
   hardware, software, firmware or a combination thereof, including one or more signal
   processing and/or application specific integrated circuits.
   [00711          The electronic device 702 that can include one or more computer-readable
20 mediums 710, processing system 720, touch subsystem 730, display/graphics subsystem 740,
   communications circuitry 750, storage 760, and audio circuitry 770. These components may
   be coupled by one or more communication buses or other signal lines. The electronic device
   702 can be the same as or similar to the electronic device 102, the electronic device 200, or
   the electronic device 400..
25  100721         The communications circuitry 750 can include RF circuitry 752 and/or port
   754 for sending and receiving information. The RF circuitry 752 permits transmission of
   information over a wireless link or network to one or more other devices and includes well
   known circuitry for performing this function. The port 754 permits transmission of
   information over a wired link. The communi nations circuitry 750 can communicate, for
30 example, with the authentication system 704. The communications circuitry 750 can be
   coupled to the processing system 720 via a peripherals interface 724. The peripherals
   interface 724 can include various known components for establishing and maintaining
   conimunication between peripherals and the processing system 720.
                                                   16

   [0073]           The audio circuitry 770 can be coupled to an audio speaker (not shown), a
   microphone (not shown), an electronic card reader (not shown), or any combination thereof
   and includes known circuitry for processing voice signals received fnom the peripherals
   interface 724 to enable a user to communicate in real-time with other users. In some
 5 embodiments, the audio circuitry 770 includes a headphone jack (not shown).
   100741           The peripherals interface 724 can couple various peripherals, such as an
   electronic card reader, of the system to one or more processors 726 and the computer
   readable medium 710. The one or more processors 726 can communicate with one or more
   computer-readable mediums 710 via a controller 722. The computer-readable medium 710
10 can be any device or medium that can store code and/or data for use by the one or more
   processors 726. The medium 710 can include a memory hierarchy, including but not limited
   to cache, main memory and secondary memory. The memory hierarchy can be implemented
   using any combination of RAM (e.g., SRAM, DRAM, [DRAM), ROM, FLASH, magnetic
   and/or optical storage devices, such as disk drives, magnetic tape, CDs (compact disks) and
15 DVl)s (digital video discs). The medium 710 may also include a transmission medium for
   carrying information-bearing signals indicative of computer instructions or data (with or
   without a carrier wave upon which the signals are modulated). For example, the transmission
   medium may include a communications network, including but not limited to the Internet,
   intranet(s), Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Local Area Networks (WLANs), Storage
20 Area Networks (SANs), Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN) and the like.
   [00751           The one or more processors 726 can run various software components stored
   in the medium 710 to perform various functions for the electronic device 702. Note that the
   order of the modules in the medium 710 does not denote the order of a software stack as
   implemented in the medium 710. In some embodiments, the software components include an
25 operating system 711, a communication module (or set of instructions) 712, a touch
   processing module (or set of instructions) 713, an interface module (or set of instructions)
   715, such as the passcode interface module 202 of FIG. 2, and one or more applications (or
   set of instructions) 718. Each of these modules and above noted applications correspond to a
   set of instructions for performing one or more functions described above and the methods
30 described in this application (e.g., the computer-implemented methods and other information
   processing methods described herein). These modules (e.g., sets of instructions) need not be
   implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various subsets
   of these modules may be combined or otherwise rearranged in various embodiments. In
                                                   17

   some embodiments, the medium 710 may store a subset of the modules and data structures
   identified above. Furthermore, the medium 710 may store additional modules and data
   structures not described above.
   [00761          The operating system 7 11 can include various procedures, sets of instructions,
 5 software components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks (e.g.
   memory management, storage device control, power management, etc.) and facilitates
   communication between various hardware and software components.
   [00771          The communication module 712 facilitates communication with other devices
   using the communications circuitry 750 and includes various software components for
10 handling data received from the RF circuitry 752 and/or the port 754.
   100781          The touch processing module 713 includes various software components for
   performing various tasks associated with touch hardware 734 including but not limited to
   receiving and processing touch input received from the I/O device 730 via a touch i/O device
   controller 732. For example, the touch processing module 713 can also include software
15 components for performing tasks associated with other I/O devices (not shown).
   [00791          The interface module 715 is configured to present and maintain a passcode
   interface for a user to enter a passcode to authenticate the user's identity. The interface
   module 715 can include various known software components for rendering, animating and
   displaying graphical objects on a display surface. In embodiments, in which the touch
20 hardware 734 is a touch sensitive display (e.g., touch screen), the interface module 715
   includes components for rendering, displaying, and animating objects on the touch sensitive
   display. The interface module 715 can provide animation instructions to an animation engine
   722, which can render the graphics and provide the rendering to graphics I/O controller 744,
   so that the graphics 1/O controller 744 can display the graphics on display 746. The interface
25 module 7115 can further control the audio circuitry 770 to provide an auditory component to
   the passcode interface.
   [00801          One or more applications 718 can include any applications installed on the
   electronic device 702, including without limitation, modules of the electronic device 200, a
   browser, keyboard emulation, widgets, JAVA-enabled applications, encryption, digital rights
30 management, voice recognition, voice replication, location determination capability (such as
   that provided by the global positioning system (GPS)), etc.
   [00811          The touch I/O controller 732 is coupled to the touch hardware 734 for
   controlling or performing various functions. The touch hardware 732 communicates with the
                                                   18

   processing system 720 via the touch i/O device controller 732, which includes various
   components for processing user touch input (e.g., scanning hardware). One or more other
   input controllers (not shown) receives/sends electrical signals from/to other I/O devices (not
   shown). Other I/O devices may include physical buttons, dials, slider switches, sticks,
 5 keyboards, touch pads, additional display screens, or any combination thereof.
   100821            If embodied as a touch screen, the touch hardware 734 displays visual output
   to the user in a GUI. The visual output may include text, graphics, video, and any
   combination thereof Some or all of the visual output may correspond to user-interface
   objects. The touch hardware 734 forms a touch-sensitive surface that accepts touch input
10 from the user. The touch hardware 734 and the touch controller 732 (along with any
   associated modules and/or sets of instructions in the medium 710) detects and tracks touches
   or near touches (and any movement or release of the touch) on the touch hardware 734 and
   converts the detected touch input into interaction with graphical objects, such as one or more
   user-interface objects. In the case in which the touch hardware 734 and the display 746 are
15 embodied as a touch screen, the user can directly interact with graphical objects that are
   displayed on the touch screen. Alternatively, in the case in which hardware 734 is embodied
   as a touch device other than a touch screen (e.g., a touch pad), the user may indirectly interact
   with graphical objects that are displayed on a separate display screen.
   [0083]            Embodiments in which the touch hardware 734 is a touch screen, the touch
20 screen may use LCD (liquid crystal display) technology, LPD (light emitting polymer
