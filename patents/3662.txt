 Detailed Description of The Invention
         (S)-N-((S)-1-cyclohexyl-2-{(S)-2-[4-(4-fluoro-benzoyl)-thiazol-2-yl
 pyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-oxo-ethyl)-2-methylamino-propionamide (structure depicted in

 least in part, the HA, A, B, C, and D crystalline forms for the compound of Formula
 ().
         The crystalline forms of Compound (1),its salts and solvates can be
 characterized by a number of methods, including but not limited to, Powder X-Ray
 diffraction (PXRD), simulated powder X-ray patterns (Yin. S.; Scaringe, R. P.;
 DiMarco, J.; Galella, M. and Gougoutas, J. Z., American Pharmaceutical Review,
 2003, 6, 2, 80), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments, Solid-state

WO 2011/018474                                                        PCT/EP2010/061679
 C-13 NMR measurements, (W. L. Earl and D. L. VanderHart, J. Magn. Reson.,
 1982, 48, 35-54), Raman spectroscopy, Infra-red spectroscopy, Moisture sorption
 isotherms (VTI--variable temperature isotherms), and hot stage techniques.
         The forms may be characterized and distinguished using single crystal x
 ray diffraction, which is based on unit cell measurements of a single crystal of a
 particular form at a fixed analytical temperature. A detailed description of unit cells
 is provided in Stout & Jensen, X-Ray Structure Determination: A Practical Guide,
 Macmillan Co., New York (1968), Chapter 3,which is herein incorporated by
 reference. Alternatively, the unique arrangement of atoms in spatial relation within
 the crystalline lattice may be characterized according to the observed fractional
 atomic coordinates. Another means of characterizing the crystalline structure is by
 powder x-ray diffraction analysis in which the diffraction profile is compared to a
 simulated profile representing pure powder material, both run at the same
 analytical temperature, and measurements for the subject form characterized as a
 series of 20 values.
         One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that an X-ray diffraction
 pattern may be obtained with a measurement error that is dependent upon the
 measurement conditions employed, In particular, it is generally known that
 intensities in a X-ray diffraction pattern may fluctuate depending upon
 measurement conditions employed. It should be further understood that relative
 intensities may also vary depending upon experimental conditions and,
 accordingly, the exact order of intensity should not be taken into account.
 Additionally, a measurement error of diffraction angle for a conventional X-ray
 diffraction pattern is typically about 5% or less, and such degree of measurement
 error should be taken into account as pertaining to the aforementioned diffraction
 angles. Consequently, it is to be understood that the crystal forms of the instant
 invention are not limited to the crystal forms that provide X-ray diffraction patterns
 completely identical to the X-ray diffraction patterns depicted in the accompanying
 Figures disclosed herein. Any crystal forms that provide X-ray diffraction patterns
 substantially identical to those disclosed in the accompanying Figures fall within
 the scope of the present invention. The ability to ascertain substantial identities of
 X-ray diffraction patterns is within the purview of one of ordinary skill in the art.

          Likewise, it is to be understood that any crystal forms that provide
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric annalysis (TGA),
and/or moisture sorption isotherms patterns substantially identical to those
disclosed in the accompanying Figures fall within the scope of the present
invention. The ability to ascertain substantial identities of these patterns is within

and B3 are commercially available.
          Form HA is a crystalline hemihydrate with water content of -1.7%. This
form is slightly hygroscopic. Its water content stays -1.7% between 10% relative
 humidity (RH) and 70% RH and takes additional -0.4% of moisture from 70%RH
to 95%RH. Upon heating to above 100*C, Form           HA  loses water and converts to
 Form B.

         The manufacturing process for low dose including 10 mg and up to 50 mg
 consists of weighing of excipients and drug substance. This is followed by
 blending of drug substance with excipients like Microcrystalline cellulose,
 Mannitol, Dicalcium Phosphate, Spray dried Lactose, Polyvinyl pyrollidone XL,
 Starch, Colloidal silicone dioxide and magnesium stearate; preferably with
 Dicalcium phosphate, Microcrystalline cellulose, Polyvinyl pyrollidone XL and
 Colloidal silicone dioxide to obtain a pre-blend. The pre-blended is lubricated with
 magnesium stearate, and compressed to obtain cores which are film coated. The
 drug load varied from 7% up to 36%. But preferred from approximately 10% to
 approximately 18%.
         The manufacturing process for the tablets containing more drug substance,
 including 250mg and higher, preferable 300mg or higher, 400 mg or higher, 500
 mg or higher, starts with weighing of the excipients and drug substance. Once all
 excipients and drug substance are weighed, the drug substance is dry blended
 with microcrystalline cellulose, especially Avicel PH101 in a high shear mixer. The
 blended material is wetted preferably with PVP-K30 in a water solution. The wet
 mass is kneaded to obtain a granulate. The granulate is dried preferably is a
 fluidized bed dryer followed by screening. The screen granulate is lubricated to
 obtain a final blend which is compressed to obtained cores that are film coated.

         Vitamin E TPGS (d-alpha tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) is
 normally a waxy substance at room temperature, which is difficult to process;
 however it can made into a particulate form by freezing and then milling, which
 allows for direct blending of the vitamin E TPGS. A direct blending process is one
 that involves the dry processing of an excipient such as vitamin E TPGS and the
 active ingredient, in this case (S)-N-((S)-1-cyclohexyl-2-{(S)-2-[4-(4-fluoro
 benzoyl)-thiazo-2-yl]-pyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-oxo-ethyl)-2-methylamino-propionamide.
 Dry processing means that the excipients are processed in a dry state and not
 melted, and moreover do not form a solid solution or solid dispersion., Vitamin E
 TPGS can be direct blended made by freezing and milling can be processed more
 easily, and can be present in the composition in an amounts up to about 20%,
 about 25%, or about 35%, or about 40%, or less than 50% (w/w). Dry processed

         Based on the experience from 10 and 50 mg formulation development,
 several compaction simulation trials on a single punch machine are carried out in
 an attempt to develop higher strength ( e.g. 250 mg) by simulating roller
 compaction process. Several trials are done, to assess the processability, using
 combination of excipients like microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch,
 dicalcium phosphate and mannitol as fillers and hydroxypropyl cellulose, Kollidon
 VA64, as binders. Several issues like bad flow, sticking poor compaction are
 observed even at drug load of about 30%. These problems could not be solved by
 qualitative or quantitative variations of the excipients. It is thought that milled drug
 substance, with greater surface area (hence greater bonding area) would provide
 stronger compacts / granulate proving granules on milling that can be processed;
 however no significant improvement is seen. These compaction simulation results
 are unexpected. No attempt was made to reduce the drug load below 30% as
 that would have increased the size of tablet considerably; inconvenient for the
 subject especially when intake of multiple tablets is planned in the clinical study.
         The technical manufacturing problems are successfully solved and higher
 drug load (greater than 40% w/w, greater than 50% w/w, greater than 60% w/w,
 greater than 70% w/w, or greater than 80% w/w) is obtained by using the wet
 granulation and/or the dry granulation processes. In a wet granulation method,
 the high dosage strength with a high drug load (e.g., 50% w/w) is possible with
 specifically selected and adjusted conventional excipients and granulating
 solvent.
