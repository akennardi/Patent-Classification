Description
Bath Bomb (also known as Bath Fizzer) is made using an established method and the mixture, by
hand or manufactured press, packed into a mould of various shapes and sizes.
Embed Soap is made using an established method (being either melt and pour process, cold or hot
process or liquid bead) and poured into a mould of various shapes and of the size suitable for
insertion into the Bath Bomb, appropriately one third of the Bath Bomb.
The Bath Bomb mixture is packed into the mould leaving room for the Embed Soap to be inserted
into the Bath Bomb, usually the middle. The remaining Bath Bomb mixture is packed around the
Embed Soap filling any gaps and compacted into the mould.
The Bath Bomb/Embed Soap Insert is removed from the mould and allowed to harden and dry in the
normal fashion, resulting in the outer Bath Bomb encapsulating the inner Embed Soap as a whole
Bath Bomb. When used, the compacted mixture of Bath Bomb ingredients effervesce when wet,
dispersing essential oils, scents, bubble and colour into the bath water, leaving the Embed Soap for
use by the bather.
