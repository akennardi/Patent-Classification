   This disclosure relates to the adaptation of communication direction in wireless communication
   networks that utilize Time Division Duplex (TDD). A wireless communication network includes a
30 DownLink (DL) that conveys signals from transmission points (such as base stations or eNodeBs)
   to user equipments (UEs). The wireless communication network also includes an UpLink (UL)
   that conveys signals from UEs to reception points such as eNodeBs.
   FIGURE 1 illustrates an example wireless network 100 according to this disclosure. The
35 embodiment of the wireless network 100 shown in FIGURE 1 is for illustration only. Other
   embodiments of the wireless network 100 could be used without departing from the scope of
   this disclosure.
   As shown in FIGURE 1, the wireless network 100 includes an eNodeB (eNB) 101, an eNB 102,
40 and an eNB 103. The eNB 101 communicates with the eNB 102 and the eNB 103. The eNB 101

                                                     0
   also communicates with at least one Internet Protocol (IP) network 130, such as the Internet, a
   proprietary IP network, or other data network.
   Depending on the network type, other well-known terms may be used instead of "eNodeB" or
 5 "eNB," such as "base station" or "access point." For the sake of convenience, the terms
   "eNodeB" and "eNB" are used in this patent document to refer to network infrastructure
   components that provide wireless access to remote terminals. Also, depending on the network
   type, other well-known terms may be used instead of "user equipment" or "UE," such as
   "mobile station," "subscriber station," "remote terminal," "wireless terminal," or "user device."
 0 For the sake of convenience, the terms "user equipment" and "UE" are used in this patent
   document to refer to remote wireless equipment that wirelessly accesses an eNB, whether the
   UE is a mobile device (such as a mobile telephone or smartphone) or is normally considered a
   stationary device (such as a desktop computer or vending machine).
 5 The eNB 102 provides wireless broadband access to the network 130 for a first plurality of user
   equipments (UEs) within a coverage area 120 of the eNB 102. The first plurality of UEs includes
   a UE 111, which may be located in a small business (SB); a UE 112, which may be located in an
   enterprise (E); a UE 113, which may be located in a WiFi hotspot (HS); a UE 114, which may be
   located in a first residence (R); a UE 115, which may be located in a second residence (R); and a
 0 UE 116, which may be a mobile device (M) like a cell phone, a wireless laptop, a wireless PDA,
   or the like. The eNB 103 provides wireless broadband access to the network 130 for a second
   plurality of UEs within a coverage area 125 of the eNB 103. The second plurality of UEs includes
   the UE 115 and the UE 116. In some embodiments, one or more of the eNBs 101-103 may
   communicate with each other and with the UEs 111-116 using 5G, LTE, LTE-A, WiMAX, or other
 5 advanced wireless communication techniques.
   Dotted lines show the approximate extents of the coverage areas 120 and 125, which are
   shown as approximately circular for the purposes of illustration and explanation only. It should
   be clearly understood that the coverage areas associated with eNBs, such as the coverage areas
30 120 and 125, may have other shapes, including irregular shapes, depending upon the
   configuration of the eNBs and variations in the radio environment associated with natural and
   man-made obstructions.
   As described in more detail below, various components of the network 100 (such as the eNBs
35 101-103 and/or the UEs 111-116) support transmitting acknowledgement information signaling
   in the network 100, which can utilize TDD.
   Although FIGURE 1 illustrates one example of a wireless network 100, various changes may be
   made to FIGURE 1. For example, the wireless network 100 could include any number of eNBs
40 and any number of UEs in any suitable arrangement. Also, the eNB 101 could communicate

   directly with any number of UEs and provide those UEs with wireless broadband access to the
   network 130. Similarly, each eNB 102-103 could communicate directly with the network 130
   and provide UEs with direct wireless broadband access to the network 130. Further, the eNB
   101, 102, and/or 103 could provide access to other or additional external networks, such as
 5 external telephone networks or other types of data networks.
   FIGURE 2 illustrates an example UE 114 according to this disclosure. The embodiment of the UE
   114 shown in FIGURE 2 is for illustration only, and the other UEs in FIGURE 1 could have the
   same or similar configuration. However, UEs come in a wide variety of configurations, and
 0 FIGURE 2 does not limit the scope of this disclosure to any particular implementation of a UE.
   As shown in FIGURE 2, the UE 114 includes an antenna 205, a radio frequency (RF) transceiver
   210, transmit (TX) processing circuitry 215, a microphone 220, and receive (RX) processing
   circuitry 225. The UE 114 also includes a speaker 230, a main processor 240, an input/output
 5 (1/0) interface (IF) 245, a keypad 250, a display 255, and a memory 260. The memory 260
   includes a basic operating system (OS) program 261 and one or more applications 262.
   The RF transceiver 210 receives, from the antenna 205, an incoming RF signal transmitted by an
   eNB or another UE. The RF transceiver 210 down-converts the incoming RF signal to generate
 0 an intermediate frequency (IF) or baseband signal. The IF or baseband signal is sent to the RX
   processing circuitry 225, which generates a processed baseband signal by filtering, decoding,
   and/or digitizing the baseband or IFsignal. The RX processing circuitry 225 transmits the
   processed baseband signal to the speaker 230 (such as for voice data) or to the main processor
   240 for further processing (such as for web browsing data).
 5
   The TX processing circuitry 215 receives analog or digital voice data from the microphone 220
   or other outgoing baseband data (such as web data, e-mail, or interactive video game data)
   from the main processor 240. The TX processing circuitry 215 encodes, multiplexes, and/or
   digitizes the outgoing baseband data to generate a processed baseband or IFsignal. The RF
30 transceiver 210 receives the outgoing processed baseband or IF signal from the TX processing
   circuitry 215 and up-converts the baseband or IFsignal to an RF signal that is transmitted via
   the antenna 205.
   The main processor 240 can include one or more processors or other processing devices and
35 can execute the basic OS program 261 stored in the memory 260 in order to control the overall
   operation of the UE 114. For example, the main processor 240 could control the reception of
   forward channel signals and the transmission of reverse channel signals by the RF transceiver
   210, the RX processing circuitry 225, and the TX processing circuitry 215 in accordance with
   well-known principles. In some embodiments, the main processor 240 includes at least one
40 microprocessor or microcontroller.

                                                     -U
   The main processor 240 is also capable of executing other processes and programs resident in
   the memory 260. The main processor 240 can move data into or out of the memory 260 as
   required by an executing process such as operations in support of transmitting
 5 acknowledgement signals in adaptively configured time division duplex (TDD) communication
   systems. In some embodiments, the main processor 240 is configured to execute the
   applications 262 based on the OS program 261 or in response to signals received from eNBs,
   other UEs, or an operator. The main processor 240 is also coupled to the 1/O interface 245,
   which provides the UE 114 with the ability to connect to other devices such as laptop
 0 computers and handheld computers. The 1/O interface 245 is the communication path between
   these accessories and the main processor 240.
   The main processor 240 is also coupled to the keypad 250 and the display unit 255. The
   operator of the UE 114 can use the keypad 250 to enter data into the UE 114. The display 255
 5 may be a liquid crystal display or other display capable of rendering text and/or at least limited
   graphics, such as from web sites. The display 255 could also represent a touchscreen.
   The memory 260 is coupled to the main processor 240. Part of the memory 260 could include a
   random access memory (RAM), and another part of the memory 260 could include a Flash
 0 memory or other read-only memory (ROM).
   As described in more detail below, the transmit and receive paths of the UE 114 (implemented
   using the RF transceiver 210, TX processing circuitry 215, and/or RX processing circuitry 225)
   support downlink signaling for uplink and downlink adaptation in adaptively configured TDD
 5 systems.
   Although FIGURE 2 illustrates one example of UE 114, various changes may be made to FIGURE
   2. For example, various components in FIGURE 2 could be combined, further subdivided, or
   omitted and additional components could be added according to particular needs. As a
30 particular example, the main processor 240 could be divided into multiple processors, such as
   one or more central processing units (CPUs) and one or more graphics processing units (GPUs).
   Also, while FIGURE 2 illustrates the UE 114 configured as a mobile telephone or smartphone,
   UEs could be configured to operate as other types of mobile or stationary devices. In addition,
   various components in FIGURE 2 could be replicated, such as when different RF components
35 are used to communicate with the eNBs 101-103 and with other UEs.
   FIGURE 3 illustrates an example eNB 102 according to this disclosure. The embodiment of the
   eNB 102 shown in FIGURE 3 is for illustration only, and other eNBs of FIGURE 1 could have the
   same or similar configuration. However, eNBs come in a wide variety of configurations, and
40 FIGURE 3 does not limit the scope of this disclosure to any particular implementation of an eNB.

   As shown in FIGURE 3, the eNB 102 includes multiple antennas 305a-305n, multiple RF
   transceivers 310a-310n, transmit (TX) processing circuitry 315, and receive (RX) processing
   circuitry 320. The eNB 102 also includes a controller/processor 325, a memory 330, and a
 5 backhaul or network interface 335.
   The RF transceivers 310a-310n receive, from the antennas 305a-305n, incoming RF signals, such
   as signals transmitted by UEs or other eNBs. The RF transceivers 310a-310n down-convert the
   incoming RF signals to generate IF or baseband signals. The IFor baseband signals are sent to
 0 the RX processing circuitry 320, which generates processed baseband signals by filtering,
   decoding, and/or digitizing the baseband or IF signals. The RX processing circuitry 320 transmits
   the processed baseband signals to the controller/ processor 325 for further processing.
   The TX processing circuitry 315 receives analog or digital data (such as voice data, web data, e
 5 mail, or interactive video game data) from the controller/processor 325. The TX processing
   circuitry 315 encodes, multiplexes, and/or digitizes the outgoing baseband data to generate
   processed baseband or IF signals. The RF transceivers 310a-310n receive the outgoing
   processed baseband or IF signals from the TX processing circuitry 315 and up-converts the
   baseband or IF signals to RF signals that are transmitted via the antennas 305a-305n.

   The controller/processor 325 can include one or more processors or other processing devices
   that control the overall operation of the eNB 102. For example, the controller/processor 325
   could control the reception of forward channel signals and the transmission of reverse channel
   signals by the RF transceivers 310a-310n, the RX processing circuitry 320, and the TX processing
 5 circuitry 315 in accordance with well-known principles. The controller/processor 325 could
   support additional functions as well, such as more advanced wireless communication functions.
   For instance, the controller/processor 325 could support beam forming or directional routing
   operations in which outgoing signals from multiple antennas 305a-305n are weighted
   differently to effectively steer the outgoing signals in a desired direction. Any of a wide variety
30 of other functions could be supported in the eNB 102 by the controller/processor 325. In some
   embodiments, the controller/ processor 325 includes at least one microprocessor or
   microcontroller.
   The controller/processor 325 is also capable of executing programs and other processes
35 resident in the memory 330, such as a basic OS and operations in support of providing channel
   state information for scheduling downlink transmissions in adaptively configured time division
   duplex (TDD) communication systems. The controller/processor 325 can move data into or out
   of the memory 330 as required by an executing process.
40 The controller/processor 325 is also coupled to the backhaul or network interface 335. The

                                                   -LIL
   backhaul or network interface 335 allows the eNB 102 to communicate with other devices or
   systems over a backhaul connection or over a network. The interface 335 could support
   communications over any suitable wired or wireless connection(s). For example, when the eNB
   102 is implemented as part of a cellular communication system (such as one supporting 5G, LTE,
 5 or LTE-A), the interface 335 could allow the eNB 102 to communicate with other eNBs over a
   wired or wireless backhaul connection. When the eNB 102 is implemented as an access point,
   the interface 335 could allow the eNB 102 to communicate over a wired or wireless local area
   network or over a wired or wireless connection to a larger network (such as the Internet). The
   interface 335 includes any suitable structure supporting communications over a wired or
 0 wireless connection, such as an Ethernet or RF transceiver.
   The memory 330 is coupled to the controller/processor 325. Part of the memory 330 could
   include a RAM, and another part of the memory 330 could include a Flash memory or other
   ROM.

   As described in more detail below, the transmit and receive paths of the eNB 102
   (implemented using the RF transceivers3l0a-310n, TX processing circuitry 315, and/or RX
   processing circuitry 320) support downlink signaling for uplink and downlink adaptation in
   adaptively configured TDD systems.
 0
   Although FIGURE 3 illustrates one example of an eNB 102, various changes may be made to
   FIGURE 3. For example, the eNB 102 could include any number of each component shown in
   FIGURE 3. As a particular example, an access point could include a number of interfaces 335,
   and the controller/processor 325 could support routing functions to route data between
 5 different network addresses. As another particular example, while shown as including a single
   instance of TX processing circuitry 315 and a single instance of RX processing circuitry 320, the
   eNB 102 could include multiple instances of each (such as one per RF transceiver).
   In some wireless networks, DL signals include data signals conveying information content,
30 control signals conveying DL Control Information (DCI), and Reference Signals (RS). An eNB
   transmits data information through respective Physical DL Shared CHannels (PDSCHs). An eNB
   transmits DCI over Physical DL Control CHannels (PDCCHs) or Enhanced PDCCHs (EPDCCHs). A
   PDCCH is transmitted over one or more Control Channel Elements (CCEs) while an EPDCCH is
   transmitted over ECCEs (see also REF 1). An eNB, such as eNB 102, transmits one or more of
35 multiple types of RS including a UE-Common RS (CRS), a Channel State Information RS (CSI-RS),
   and a DeModulation RS (DMRS). A CRS is effectively transmitted over an entire DLBandWidth
   (BW) and can be used by UEs, such as UE 114, to demodulate PDSCH or PDCCH, or to perform
   measurements. eNB 102 also can transmit CSI-RS with a smaller density in the time and/or
   frequency domain than a CRS. DMRS is transmitted only in a BW of a respective PDSCH or
40 PDCCH and UE 114 can use a DMRS to coherently demodulate information in a PDSCH or

   EPDCCH (see also REF 1).
   In some wireless networks, UL signals can include data signals conveying information content,
   control signals conveying UL Control Information (UCI), and RS. UE 114 transmits data
 5 information or UCI through a respective Physical UL Shared CHannel (PUSCH) or a Physical UL
   Control CHannel (PUCCH). If UE 114 transmits data information and UCI in a same Transmission
   Time Interval (TTI), UE 114can multiplex both in a PUSCH. UCI includes Hybrid Automatic
   Repeat reQuest ACKnowledgement (HARQ-ACK) information, indicating correct (ACK) or
   incorrect (NACK) detection of data Transport Blocks (TBs) in a PDSCH, Scheduling Request (SR)
 0 indicating whether UE 114 has data in its buffer, and Channel State Information (CSI) enabling
   eNB 102 to select appropriate parameters for PDSCH or PDCCH transmissions to UE 114. If UE
   114 fails to detect a PDCCH scheduling a PDSCH, UE 114 can indicate this using a HARQ-ACK
   state referred to as DTX. A DTX and a NACK can often be mapped on a same value (NACK/DTX
   value, see also REF 3). UL RS includes DMRS and Sounding RS (SRS). DMRS is transmitted only in
 5 a BW of a respective PUSCH or PUCCH. eNB 102 can use a DMRS for coherent demodulation of
   information in a PUSCH or PUCCH. SRS is transmitted by UE 114 to provide eNB 102with an UL
   CSI.
   CSI transmission can be periodic (P-CSI) in a PUCCH with parameters configured to UE 114 by
 0 higher layer signaling, such as for example Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling, or aperiodic
   (A-CSI) in a PUSCH as triggered by an A-CSI request field included in a DCI format conveyed by a
   PDCCH scheduling the PUSCH (see also REF 2). DMRS is transmitted only in a BW of a respective
   PUSCH or PUCCH and eNB 102 can use a DMRS to demodulate information in a PUSCH or
   PUCCH. SRS is transmitted by UE 114 in order to provide eNB 102 with an UL CSI. SRS
 5 transmission from UE 114 can be periodic (P-SRS) at predetermined instances with transmission
   parameters configured to UE 114 by higher layer signaling or it can be aperiodic (A-SRS) as
   triggered by a DCI format conveyed by a PDCCH scheduling PUSCH or PDSCH (see also REF 2).
   A CSI report from UE 114 includes a Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) and the CSI report can also
30 include a Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI). The CQ indicates to eNB 102 a Modulation and
   Coding Scheme (MCS) for a PDSCH transmission to UE 114. The PMI indicates a combining of a
   PDSCH transmission from multiple eNB antenna ports in accordance with a Multiple Input
   Multiple Output (MIMO) transmission method. An RI report from UE 114 provides information
   to a serving eNB for a number of spatial layers that can be supported for a PDSCH. Table 1
35 indicates exemplary values for a 4-bit CQ (16 index values) transmitted in a PUCCH (see also
   REF 3). Table 2 indicates a mapping for an MCS field, IMCS in a DCI format scheduling a PDSCH to
   a modulation order (Qm) and a Transport Block Size (TBS) index,    ITBS, for data transmission in the
   PDSCH. When UE 114experiences a high Signal-to-Noise and Interference Ratio (SINR), it can be
   configured by eNB 102 aCQ Table having 16 index values, similar to Table 1, and a Modulation
40 and TBS index Table, similar to Table 2, but also including use of 256QAM modulation to

support higher values for spectral efficiency.

  A DMRS or SRS transmission can be through a transmission of a respective Zadoff-Chu (ZC)
5 sequence (see also REF 1). Different CSs of a ZC sequence can provide orthogonal ZC sequences

                                                    -L /
   and can be allocated to different UEs to achieve orthogonal multiplexing of respective HARQ
   ACK signals and RS in a same PRB. Such orthogonal multiplexing can also be in the time domain
   using Orthogonal Covering Codes (OCC). In this manner, as is subsequently described, a PUCCH
   multiplexing capacity per RB is increased by a factor of 3 (determined by the OCC with the
 5 smaller length). A PUCCH resource nPUCCH in a RB for HARQ-ACK signal or DMRS transmission is
   defined by a pair of an OCC nec and a CS    ". If all resources within a PUCCH RB are used,
   resources in an immediately next RB can be used.
   A PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission power is determined so that an associated signal is received
 0 with a desired SINR at eNB 102 while controlling a respective interference to neighboring cells
   thereby achieving a reception reliability target and ensuring proper network operation. UL
   Power Control (PC) includes Open-Loop Power Control (OLPC) with cell-specific and UE-specific
   parameters and Closed Loop Power Control (CLPC) corrections provided by eNB 102 through
   Transmission Power Control (TPC) commands (see also REF 3). If a PUSCH transmission is
 5 scheduled by a PDCCH, a TPC command is included in a respective DCI format. TPC commands
   can also be provided by a separate PDCCH conveying a DCI format 3 or a DCI format 3A, jointly
   referred to as DCI format 3/3A, providing TPC commands to a group of UEs. A DCI format
   includes Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) bits and UE 114 identifies a DCI format type from a
   respective Radio Network Temporary Identifier (RNTI) used to scramble the CRC bits. For DCI
 0 format 3/3A, a RNTI is a TPC-RNTI UE 114 is configured by higher layer signaling. For a DCI
   format scheduling a PUSCH transmission from UE 114 or a PDSCH transmission to UE 114, a
   RNTI is a Cell RNTI (C-RNTI). Additional RNTI types also exist. A power of a SRS transmission
   follows a power of a PUSCH transmission power.

   following only the case of HARQ-ACK bits, the block code can be a     (32,0       H4RQ-ACK)
   Reed-Mueller (RM) code (also see REF 2). For a Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) system, one or
   two HARQ-ACK bits can also be transmitted using PUCCH Format la or PUCCH Format 1b,
 5 respectively, while for a Time Division Duplex (TDD) system up to four HARQ-ACK bits can be
   transmitted using PUCCH Format lb with resource multiplexing (see also REF 3).
   FIGURE 7 illustrates an example PUCCH Format 3 structure in one TTI slot for HARQ-ACK
   transmission with joint coding according to this disclosure. The embodiment of the transmitter
 0 700 shown in FIGURE 7 is for illustration only.    Other embodiments could be used without
   departing from the scope of the present disclosure.
   As shown in FIGURE 7, after encoding and modulation using respectively, for example, a
    (32,0 HAQ-ACK                 RM code punctured to a            0HARQ-ACK)            RM code and
 5 Quaternary Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation (not shown for brevity), a set of same HARQ
   ACK bits 710 is multiplied 720 with elements of an OCC 730 and is subsequently DFT precoded
   740. For example, for 5 symbols per slot carrying HARQ-ACK bits, the OCC has length 5 {OCC(0),
   OCC(1), OCC(2), OCC(3), OCC(4)} and can be either of {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, or {1, exp(j2n/5), exp(j4r/5),
   exp(j6r/5), exp(j8r/5)}, or {1, exp(j4r/5), exp(j8r/5), exp(j2n/5), exp(j6r/5)}, or {1, exp(j6r/5),
 0 exp(j2n/5), exp(j8r/5), exp(j4r/5)}, or {1, exp(j8r/5), exp(j6r/5), exp(j4r/5), exp(j2n/5)}. The
   output is passed through an IFFT 750 and it is then mapped to a TTI symbol 760. As the previous
   operations are linear, their relative order may be inter-changed. A PUCCH is transmitted in one
   RB over one TTI. Consequently, 24 encoded HARQ-ACK bits are transmitted in each slot and
   they are mapped to 12 QPSK symbols. The same or different HARQ-ACK bits may be
25 transmitted in the second slot of a TTI. In addition to HARQ-ACK signals, RS are transmitted in
   each slot to enable coherent demodulation of HARQ-ACK signals. A RS is constructed from a
   length-12 ZC sequence 770 that is passed through an IFFT 780 and mapped to another TTI
   symbol 790. Multiplexing of RS from different UE is achieved by using different CSs of a same ZC
   sequence.
30
   Although the PUCCH Format 3 structure in FIGURE 7 can support HARQ-ACK payloads larger
   than a few bits, it requires large overhead as HARQ-ACK signal transmissions from a maximum
   of 5 UEs (as determined by the OCC length) can be accommodated per RB. Moreover, a
   maximum supportable HARQ-ACK payload (or HARQ-ACK and P-CSI payload) is limited to only
35 about 22 bits as a resulting code rate becomes too large for reliable reception in case of
   payloads larger than 22 bits. For a HARQ-ACK payload (or HARQ-ACK and P-CSI payload)
   between about 12 and 21 bits, a dual RM code can be used where a mapping to successive
   elements of a DFT can alternate between elements from an output of a first RM code and
   elements from an output of a second RM code in a sequential manner (see also REF 1).

   The TDD UL-DL configurations in Table 3 provide 40% and 90% of DL TTIs per frame to be DL
   TTIs (and the remaining to be UL TTIs). Despite this flexibility, a semi-static TDD UL-DL
 0 configuration that can be updated every 640 msec or less frequently by SIB signaling or, in case
   of DL Carrier Aggregation and a secondary cell by RRC signaling(see also REF3 and REF 4), may
   not match well with short-term data traffic conditions. For the remaining of this disclosure,
   such a TDD UL-DL configuration will be referred to as a conventional (or non-adapted) TDD UL
   DL configuration and it is assumed to be used by conventional (or legacy) UEs in a cell. For this
25 reason, a faster adaptation period of a TDD UL-DL configuration can improve system
   throughput, particularly for a low or moderate number of connected UEs. For example, when
   there is more DL traffic than UL traffic, the TDD UL-DL configuration can be adapted every 10,
   20, 40, or 80 msec to include more DL TTIs. Signaling for faster adaptation of a TDD UL-DL
   configuration can be provided by several mechanisms, including signaling a DCI format in a
30 PDCCH, Medium Access Control (MAC) signaling, or RRC signaling.
   An operating constraint in an adaptation of a TDD UL-DL configuration in ways other than
   conventional ones is the possible existence of UEs that cannot be aware of such adaptation.
   Such UEs are referred to as conventional UEs. Since conventional UEs perform measurements
35 in DL TTIs using a respective CRS, such DL TTIs cannot be changed to UL TTIs or to special TTIs

  by a faster adaptation of a TDD UL-DL configuration. However, an UL TTI can be changed to a DL
  TTI without impacting conventional UEs because NB 102 can ensure that such UEs do not
  transmit any signals in such UL TTIs. In addition, an UL TTI common to all TDD UL-DL
  configurations could exist to enable eNB 102 to possibly select this UL TTI as the only UL one. In
5 some implementations, including all TDD UL-DL configurations in Table 3, this UL TTI is TTI#2.
  A TTI is referred to as DL flexible TTI if the TTI is an UL TTI in a conventional TDD UL-DL
  configuration and is adapted to a DL TTI. A TTI is referred to as UL flexible TTI if the TTI is an UL
  TTI in a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration that could be adapted to a DL TTI in an adapted
0 TDD UL-DL configuration but the TTI remains an UL TTI. A TTI is referred to as DL fixed TTI if the
  TTI is a DL TTI in a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration. A TTI is referred to as UL fixed TTI if
  the TTI is an UL TTI in a TDD UL-DL configuration a UE uses to determine UL TTIs for
  transmitting HARQ-ACK information in response to PDSCH receptions. A special TTI in a
  conventional configuration can be adapted only to a DL TTI.
5
  Considering the above, Table 5 indicates flexible TTIs (denoted by 'F') for each TDD UL-DL
  configuration in Table 3.Evidently, as DL TTIs in a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration cannot
  be changed to UL TTIs, not all TDD UL-DL configurations can be used for adaptation. For
  example, if TDD UL-DL configuration 2 is the conventional one, an adaptation can be only to
0 TDD UL-DL configuration 5. Therefore, an indication for an adaptation for a TDD UL-DL
  configuration can be considered by UE 114 as invalid if, for example, it switches a DL TTI in the
  conventional TDD UL-DL configuration in an UL TTI. Invalid indications can be caused, by
  example, by the misdetection from UE 114 of a DCI format conveying an indication for an
  adapted TDD UL-DL configuration.

   If eNB 102 can adapt a TDD UL-DL configuration more frequently than by RRC signaling, for
 5 example using physical layer signaling or MAC layer signaling, then flexible TTIs (which can be
   only UL TTIs in the conventional TDD UL-DL configuration) should not carry any periodic UL
   signaling from conventional UEs as this is configured by RRC signaling. This implies that in
   flexible TTIs conventional UEs should not be configured transmissions of SRS, or CSI, or SR, or
   HARQ-ACK signaling in response to SPS PDSCH. Additionally, if a reference TDD UL-DL
 0 configuration is used for HARQ-ACK signaling in response to dynamic PDSCH receptions, a
   respective UL TTI should not be a flexible TTI. However, there is a need for UE 114 to transmit
   SRS in UL flexible TTIs since, as it is further subsequently discussed, the interference
   experienced by a signal transmission from UE 114 can be different than in UL fixed TTIs and eNB
   102 needs to obtain a respective UL CSI for UE 114 in a flexible TTI.
15
   eNB 102 can signal an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, for example, using a PDCCH that
   includes at least 3 bits for indicating a TDD UL-DL configuration from Table 3. The PDCCH can be
   transmitted either in UE 114-common space or in UE 114-dedicated space and in one or more
   predetermined TTIs. An adapted TDD UL-DL configuration remains valid over a predetermined
20 number of TTIs. Typically, for a PDCCH intended for a group of UEs or for all UEs in a cell, there
   is no HARQ-ACK transmission from UE 114 to inform eNB 102 whether or not it detected the
   PDCCH. Consequently, for UE 114 that did not detect the PDCCH conveying an adapted TDD UL
   DL configuration, communication with eNB 102 is compromised as UE 114 can have an
   incorrect understanding of a direction (DL or UL) for a flexible TTI, thereby failing to receive
25 PDCCH scheduling PDSCH or PUSCH transmissions when it incorrectly assumes that a flexible
   TTI is an UL one and needlessly attempting to detect PDCCH when it incorrectly assumes that a

   flexible TTI is a DL one.
   To establish a HARQ-ACK transmission timing that is independent from an adapted TDD UL-DL
   configuration, in order to avoid a missed detection of a respective PDCCH affecting HARQ-ACK
 5 transmission, eNB 102 can use higher layer signaling to inform UE 114 of a first TDD UL-DL
   reference configuration UE 114 can assume for transmitting HARQ-ACK signals and of a second
   TDD UL-DL reference configuration UE 114 can assume for receiving HARQ-ACK signals. For
   example, the first TDD UL-DL reference configuration can be configuration 5 while the second
   TDD UL-DL configuration can be configuration 0. Then, UE 114 always transmits HARQ-ACK
 0 signals in TTI#2 and receives HARQ-ACK signals in TTI#O or TTI#5.
   An advantage of using TDD UL-DL configuration 5 as a reference configuration for transmitting
   HARQ-ACK information from UE 114 and using TDD UL-DL configuration 0 as a reference
   configuration for receiving HARQ-ACK information by UE 114 is that UE 114allows an adapted
 5 UL-DL TDD configuration to be any one from Table 3 subject to a restriction that TTIs indicated
   as DL ones in the conventional UL-DL TDD configuration are not changed to UL ones.
   From Table 4, UE 114cantransmit HARQ-ACK information, in a same ULTTI, in response to
   PDSCH receptions in a number            of DL TTIs that is referred to as a bundling window with
 0 size          . A consequence of using UL-DL TDD configuration 5 as a reference one is that
   HARQ-ACK, P-CSI, or SR can only be transmitted in TTI#2. As TTI#2 can also be the only UL TTI
   where UE 114 transmits P-SRS, a multiplexing capacity of a PUCCH Format 3 can be further
   constrained by the puncturing of a last TTI symbol to accommodate P-SRS transmissions.
z5 If UE 114 determines a HARQ-ACK payload assuming TDD UL-DL configuration 5, a total HARQ
   ACK payload can be 18 bits, in case UE 114 is configured with a PDSCH transmission mode that
   conveys 2 data TBs, and UE 114 encodes the HARQ-ACK payload using dual RM coding (UE 114
   generates HARQ-ACK information for every DL TTI regardless of whether it receives a DL DCI
   format in a DL TTI). A disadvantage of dual RM coding over single RM coding is a performance
30 loss that exists when actual HARQ-ACK information includes less than 12 bits. Additionally, if UE
   114 determines a HARQ-ACK payload associated with TDD UL-DL configuration 5 and also needs
   to multiplex P-CSI in a PUCCH Format 3 transmission, a total combined payload can exceed 22
   bits that is a maximum payload that can be supported by PUCCH Format 3 in one RB. Then,
   HARQ-ACK spatial domain bundling needs to apply to result to a smaller HARQ-ACK payload.
35 With HARQ-ACK spatial domain bundling, UE 114 generates an ACK only if both data TBs in a
   PDSCH are correctly received; otherwise UE 114generates a NACK. A disadvantage of HARQ
   ACK spatial domain bundling is that it results to a reduced DL throughput as UE 114 reports a
   NACK even when UE 114correctly receives one of two data TBs in a PDSCH. Moreover, with or
   without HARQ-ACK bundling, if UE 114 also multiplexes in a PUCCH Format 3 a P-CSI for a fixed

   DL TTI or a P-CSI for a flexible DL TTI, a resulting total payload can be large thereby resulting to
   a high coding rate and worse reception reliability. The above reception reliability problems are
   further exacerbated if UE 114 is also configured for operation with DL Carrier Aggregation (CA)
   or Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) transmission as respective maximum payloads further
 5 increase since HARQ-ACK and P-CSI may need to be provided for each respective carrier or cell.
   An UL DCI format scheduling a PUSCH transmission from UE 114includes a field that consists of
   two bits and functions either as an UL Downlink Assignment Index (UL DAI) indicating to UE 114
   a number of DL TTIs with respective PDSCH transmissions or SPS release that UE 114 should
 0 include HARQ-ACK information for in the PUSCH or, for TDD UL-DL configuration 0(as a PDSCH
   transmission to UE 114 can only be scheduled in a same TTI as the PUSCH transmission to UE
   114) as an UL index field indicating one or more UL TTIs for respective PUSCH transmissions
   (see also REF 2). A mapping of the UL DAI bits to a number of DL TTIs for UE 114 to include
   HARQ-ACK information in a respective PUSCH is given in Table 6. For a bundling window size
 5
   M>4         , an UL DAI field maps to multiple numbers of DL TTIs and UE 114 can select one of
   them based on a number of detected PDCCHs (see also REF 3).

   One likely combination of TDD UL-DL configurations used by UE 114 for reception and
   transmission of HARQ-ACK information are TDD UL-DL configuration 0 and TDD UL-DL
   configuration 5, respectively, because they allow a maximum flexibility in selecting an adapted
   TDD UL-DL configuration. The present disclosure assumes that the conventional TDD UL-DL
25 configuration is assumed by UE 114 for reception of HARQ-ACK information and a TDD UL-DL
   configuration is configured by eNB 102 to UE 114 for determining UL subframes (and
   information payload) for HARQ-ACK transmission. However, TDD UL-DL configuration 0 may not
   be an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration and then, due to an absence of an UL DAI field in an UL
   DCI format, a HARQ-ACK payload UE 114 needs to multiplex in a PUSCH is determined by
30 assuming that each DL TTI in a respective bundling window conveys a PDSCH. When TDD UL-DL
   configuration 5 is assumed by UE 114 for transmitting HARQ-ACK information, a bundling
   window size is 9 and a significant number of PUSCH resources, linearly scaling with a total
   HARQ-ACK payload (see also REF 2), may be needlessly used to transmit HARQ-ACK information

   as a number of PDCCHs UE 114 detects can be significantly smaller than 9.
   When a PDCCH is used to convey an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration to UEs in a cell, such as
   for example a PDCCH conveying a DCI Format 1C (see also REF 2) transmitted in a UE-common
 5 space, it is possible that some UEs can be in a discontinuous reception mode (DRX mode) when
   the PDCCH is transmitted. Consequently, such UEs will not be aware of an adapted TDD UL-DL
   configuration and will have to operate using a possibly different TDD UL-DL configuration. This
   TDD UL-DL configuration can be one configured by higher layer signaling or the conventional
   one and then associated UEs can be scheduled as conventional UEs during a time period for an
 0 adapted TDD UL-DL configuration. Therefore, it is possible that UE 114 needs to transmit in a
   same PUCCH or PUSCH first HARQ-ACK information in response to PDSCH receptions scheduled
   with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration and second HARQ-ACK information in response to
   PDSCH receptions scheduled with a non-adapted TDD UL-DL configuration.
 5 A PUSCH transmission power in an UL flexible TTI can be different than in an UL fixed TTI as
   interference in the former may be from a combination of DL transmissions or UL transmissions
   in adjacent cells while interference in the latter is always from UL transmissions in adjacent
   cells. Two separate UL PC processes can be considered for UE 114; a first for use in UL fixed TTIs
   and in UL flexible TTIs where UE 114 experiences UL-dominant interference and a second for
 0 use in UL flexible TTIs where UE 114 experiences DL-dominant interference. Each UL PC process
   can have its own OLPC process or its own CLPC process, or both.
   FIGURE 13 illustrates an example of different interference characteristics in different flexible
   TTIs according to this disclosure. The embodiments of the interference characteristics shown in
 5 different flexible TTIs shown in FIGURE 13 are for illustration only. Other embodiments could be
   used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.
   As shown in FIGURE 13, TDD UL-DL configuration 1 is used in reference cell#1 1310, TDD UL-DL
   configuration 2 is used in interfering cell#2 1320, and TDD UL-DL configuration 3 is used in
30 interfering cell#3 1330. In fixed TTI#2 in cell#1 1340, cell#2 1350, and cell#3 1360, an
   interference experienced by UL transmissions is statistically same and a conventional UL PC
   process can apply. In flexible TTI#3 in cell#1 1342, an interference experienced by UL
   transmissions is different than in fixed TTI#2 as flexible TTI#3 is used for DL transmissions in
   cell#2 1352 and for UL transmissions in cell#3 1362. Therefore, UE 114 in cell#1 that is located
35 towards cell#2 can experience significantly different interference in TTI#3 than in TTI#2. In
   flexible TTI#7 in cell#1 1344, an interference experienced by UL transmissions is different than
   in fixed TTI#2, or flexible TTI#3, as flexible TTI#7 is used for UL transmissions in cell#2 1354 and
   for DL transmissions in cell#3 1364. Therefore, UE 114 in cell#1 that is located towards cell#3
   can experience significantly different interference than an interference experienced in TTI#2 or
40 in TTI#3. Finally, in flexible TTI#8 in cell#1 1346, an interference experienced by UL

                                                      .J U
   transmissions is different than in fixed TTI#2, or in flexible TTI#3, or in flexible TTI#7, as flexible
   TTI#8 is used for DL transmissions in both cell#2 1356 and cell#3 1366. Therefore, not only
   there exists interference variation between the two TTI types (fixed and flexible) but also there
   exists interference variation in different flexible TTIs.
 5
   A consequence of larger interference variations in an UL flexible TTI relative to a UL fixed TTI is
   that a reception reliability of data TBs transmitted in a PUSCH in a flexible UL TTI can be worse
   than the one of data TBs transmitted in a PUSCH is a fixed UL TTI. This is not a serious issue for
   transmissions of data TBs that can benefit from HARQ retransmissions but it is a serious issue
 0 for UCI transmissions in the PUSCH which have stricter reliability requirements and cannot
   benefit for HARQ retransmissions. For UCI transmissions in the PUCCH, a reference TDD UL-DL
   configuration can be used so that UCI in the PUCCH is always transmitted in UL fixed TTIs.
   A consequence of UL-dominant interference in a flexible DL TTI is that a separate interference
 5 measurement and CSI report is needed relative to a CSI report for fixed DL TTIs or for a flexible
   DL TTI with DL-dominant interference. Therefore UE 114 should support at least two CSI
   processes for channel measurements (using a CSI-RS) and for interference measurements
   (using two respective CSI-IMs).
 0 From Table 4 it is observed that when different UEs have different understanding of a TDD UL
   DL configuration, a respective bundling window size is also different and therefore an index of a
   same DL TTI within a respective bundling window is different. As UE 114 determines a PUCCH
   resource for transmitting a HARQ-ACK signal in response to a PDSCH reception from an index of
   a respective DL TTI in a bundling window, this can lead to a PUCCH resource collision where two
 5 or more different UEs use a same PUCCH resource to transmit respective HARQ-ACK signals. A
   remedy is for eNB 102 to configure separate PUCCH resources to be used for each TDD UL-DL
   configuration (conventional or adapted one) but this can significantly increase PUCCH overhead.
   FIGURE 14 illustrates example HARQ-ACK transmissions in a same UL TTI for 2 different TDD UL
30 DL configurations according to this disclosure. The embodiments of the HARQ-ACK
   transmissions shown in FIGURE 14 are for illustration only. Other embodiments could be used
   without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.
   As shown in FIGURE 14, TDD UL-DL configuration 1 (bundling window size of                       )is   a
35 conventional one1410 and the TDD UL-DL configuration 1is adapted to TDD UL-DL configuration
   2 (bundling window size of                ) 1420. Then, TTI#5 1430 for a conventional UE and TTI#4
   1440 for UE 114 supporting adaptive TDD UL-DL configuration have a same index in respective
   bundling windows. If all other parameters in respective PUCCH resource determination
   functions are same, a conventional UE receiving PDSCH in TTI#5 and UE 114 supporting

   adaptive TDD UL-DL configuration receiving PDSCH in TTI#4 will use a same PUCCH resource in
   TTI#2 1450 for respective HARQ-ACK signaling, thereby leading to colliding PUCCH resources
   and unreliable receptions of HARQ-ACK signals.
 5 Embodiments of this disclosure provide mechanisms for supporting UCI transmissions, and
   particularly HARQ-ACK transmissions, from UE 114 configured for operation with an adaptive
   TDD UL-DL configuration. Embodiments of this disclosure provide a mechanism for avoiding
   resource collisions between a transmission of HARQ-ACK information from UE 114 configured
   to operate with an adaptive TDD UL-DL configuration and a transmission of HARQ-ACK
 0 information from UE 114 operating with a non-adapted TDD UL-DL configuration signaled by a
   system information block when both UE transmit HARQ-ACK information using PUCCH Format
   lb with HARQ-ACK multiplexing. Embodiments of this disclosure also provide mechanisms for
   UE 114 to determine TTIs that are available for UCI multiplexing in a PUSCH depending on a UCI
   type and for accordingly interpreting fields of a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH transmission
 5 from UE 114 in a TTI. Moreover, embodiments of this disclosure provide a mechanism to
   extend a size for a UCI payload that can be supported using PUCCH Format 3.Furthermore,
   embodiments of this disclosure provide mechanisms for UE 114and eNB 102to operate when
   UE 114cannot detect a PDCCH conveying a DCI format adapting a TDD UL-DL configuration and
   eNB 102 is aware of such event. Additionally, embodiments of this disclosure provide
 0 mechanisms for UE 114 to inform eNB 102 of an actual of missed detection for a PDCCH
   conveying a DCI format indicating an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration to a group of UEs.
   Finally, embodiments of this disclosure provide mechanisms for eNB 102 to use and for UE 114
   configured for operation with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration to interpret a field in a DCI
   format scheduling a PUSCH transmission as either an UL DAI field or as an UL index field when
 5 TDD UL-DL configuration 0 is the conventional one and assumed for operation by UE 114 when
   it misses a PDCCH conveying a DCI format informing of an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration.
   Resources for PUCCH Format la/lb with HARQ-ACK Multiplexing for a UE Configured for
   Operation with Adaptive TDD UL-DL Configuration
30
   In certain embodiments, recognizing that only UL TTIs in a conventional TDD UL-DL
   configuration can be flexible TTIs, it becomes apparent that any adaptation of a conventional
   TDD UL-DL configuration can only have more DL TTIs (and less UL TTIs). Therefore, a bundling
   window size     "dapt      corresponding to DL TTIs for which HARQ-ACK is reported for an
35 adapted TDD UL-DL configuration is larger than or equal to a bundling window size
   corresponding to a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration, that is            p.           Then,
   PUCCH resource collisions for a HARQ-ACK signal transmission from a conventional UE
   operating with a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration and a HARQ-ACK signal transmission

   from UE 114 operating with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration can occur in a same UL TTI as
   it was previously described based on [Math Figure 1].
   In a first approach, aforementioned PUCCH resource collisions (in a same UL TTI) can be
 5 avoided by re-indexing DL TTIs that are in a bundling window of size              but are not in a
   bundling window of size
                                  Mfadapt       (needed only if
                                                                   MA~adapt>MA~si          - transmissions of
   respective HARQ-ACK signals are assumed to be in a same UL TTI). The DL TTIs in a bundling
   window of size       "adapt       are a super-set of the DL TTIs in a bundling window of size
               . This re-indexing is possible because UE 114,which supports adaptation of a TDD UL
 0 DL configuration, knows both a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration and the number of TTIs
   for which HARQ-ACK needs to be reported when operating with an adapted TDD UL-DL
   configuration. Therefore, UE 114 knows the DL TTIs in a bundling window of size                 "adapt
   that are not included in DL TTIs in a bundling window of size                  .
 5 An indexing of DL TTIs for determination of respective PUCCH resources for HARQ-ACK signal
   transmissions is such that DL TTIs determined from a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration and
   additional DL TTIs corresponding to operation with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, that
   are not included in the conventional TDD UL-DL configuration, are indexed in their original
   order after DL TTIs determined from the conventional TDD UL-DL configuration. Denoting by

   As shown in FIGURE 15, if TDD UL-DL configuration 1 (bundling window size of                  )

   configuration 2 (bundling window size of          SI     ) 1520 and HARQ-ACK transmission

   timing is based on TDD UL-DL configuration 2, then DL TTI#5 1530 and DL TTI#6 1540 are
   indexed first for determining PUCCH resources for respective HARQ-ACK transmissions in UL
   TTI#2 1550. In general, DL TTIs in a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration are indexed first
   using DL association indexing in Table 4. DL TTI#4 1560 and DL TTI#8 1570 are then sequentially
 5 indexed after DL TTI#5 and DL TTI#6. Therefore, for PUCCH resource determination in UL TTI#2,
   a DL TTI indexing for the adapted TDD UL-DL configuration 2 is {DL TTI#5, DL TTI#6, DL TTI#4, DL
   TTI#8} 1580 instead of a conventional indexing of {DL TTI#4, DL TTI#5, DL TTI#8, DL TTI#6}
   indicated in Table 4 (for TDD UL-DL configuration 2). Therefore, UE 114 configured to operate
   with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration also operates with a modified DL association indexing
 0 where HARQ-ACK information for the flexible SFs is placed sequentially after the HARQ-ACK
   information for DL fixed SFs according to a TDD UL-DL configuration used for UL HARQ-ACK
   transmissions by UEs configured to operate with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration.
   In a second approach, the aforementioned PUCCH resource collisions can be avoided by using a
 5 different  NPUCCn           value for PUCCH resources associated with DLTTIs included in an
   adapted TDD UL-DL configuration but not included in a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration.
   This is particularly applicable in case of PDCCH as in case of EPDCCH the ARO field can be used
   as a PUCCH resource offset.
 o With the second approach, a conventional method for PUCCH resource determination as
   described by [Math Figure 1] or by [Math Figure 2] is used but, similar to the first approach, a
   bundling window of size       adaptt       for an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration is split into two
   bundling windows (both with HARQ-ACK signal transmission in a same first UL TTI). A first
   bundling window of size                contains TTIs with respective HARQ-ACK signal transmissions
25 in the same first UL TTI that are included in the conventional TDD UL-DL configuration. A second
   bundling window of size           NS      "aC4VtSj
   contains TTIs with respective HARQ-ACK signal transmissions in a same first UL TTI that are not
   included in the conventional TDD UL-DL configuration. Additionally, UE 114 determines a
   PUCCH resource for a HARQ-ACK signal transmission in response to a PDSCH reception (or SPS
30 release) using a first configured PUCCH resource offset                   '

   Therefore, UE 114, configured for operation with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, can use
   two offsets for determining resources to transmit HARQ-ACK information in an UL TTI using
 0 PUCCH Format lb with HARQ-ACK multiplexing. For determination of resources corresponding
   to TTIs that are the same as TTIs for which a UE operating with a conventional TDD UL-DL
   configuration transmits HARQ-ACK information in the ULTTI, a first offset is used. For
   determination of resources corresponding to TTIs that are different than TTIs for which a UE
   operating with a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration transmits HARQ-ACK information in the
25 UL TTI, a second offset is used.
   In a third approach, the aforementioned PUCCH resource collisions can be avoided by using a
   different PUCCH resource determination method for DL TTIs that are not included in a
   conventional TDD UL-DL configuration.
30
   Similar to the first approach or the second approach, a bundling window of size
   M"adapt
   corresponding to transmission of HARQ-ACK information from UE 114 configured with an
   adapted TDD UL-DL configuration is split into two bundling windows (both with HARQ-ACK
35 signal transmission in a same first UL TTI). A first bundling window of size
     Msi

   contains TTIs with respective HARQ-ACK signal transmissions in a same first UL TTI that are
   included in a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration. A second bundling window of size
    MNSI             aCV-"Sj
   contains TTIs with respective HARQ-ACK signal transmissions in the same first UL TTI that are
 5 not included in the conventional TDD UL-DL configuration. A conventional method for PUCCH
   resource determination as described by [Math Figure 1] (in case of EPDCCH) or [Math Figure 2]
   (in case of PDCCH) is used for TTIs in the first bundling window.
   For TTIs in the second bundling window, a PUCCH resource can be explicitly indicated from a
 0 set of PUCCH resources that were previously configured to UE 114 by higher layer signaling (at
   least for DL TTIs occurring earlier than a first DL TTI in a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration).
   Either same or different PUCCH resources can be configured by higher layer signaling for
   different DL TTIs. The indication of a PUCCH resource can be through an ARO field in a DCI
   format scheduling a respective PDSCH (or SPS release). For example, for an ARO field including
 5 2 bits, one from four configured PUCCH resources can be indicated. Typically, as a number of DL
   TTIs included in the second bundling window is less than four, a same set of respective PUCCH
   resources can be used for all such DL TTIs if an ARO field of 2 bits is used to indicate 4 PUCCH
   resources. Unlike a determination of PUCCH resource corresponding to a TTI in the first
   bundling window for which ARO acts as an offset to an implicitly determined resource by UE
 0 114 [Math Figure 1] for a determination of PUCCH resource corresponding to a TTI in the
   second bundling window the ARO can instead directly index a PUCCH resource as
    n PUCCH:g( HRO)
   where
    g(HRO)
25 is an index to a PUCCH resource from one of at most four PUCCH resources configured to UE
   114 by eNB 102 through higher layer signaling in accordance to the third approach. In case
   transmitter diversity is supported for HARQ-ACK signal transmissions,
    g(HRO)
   is an index to a pair of PUCCH resources.
30
   FIGURE 17 illustrates an example implicit or explicit determination of a PUCCH resource for
   HARQ-ACK signaling depending on whether or not a respective DL TTI index is included in a
   conventional TDD UL-DL configuration, respectively, according to this disclosure. As shown in
   FIGURE 17, it is assumed that TDD UL-DL configuration 1 is the conventional one indicated to
35 conventional UEs and it is adapted to TDD UL-DL configuration 2 1710 and HARQ-ACK
   transmission timing is based on TDD UL-DL configuration 2. For DL TTI#5 1720 and DL TTI#6
   1730 (included in TDD UL-DL configuration 1), a respective PUCCH resource in UL TTI#2 1760 for
   a HARQ-ACK signal transmission from UE 114 in response to a respective PDSCH reception (or

   SPS release) is determined using a same method as for conventional UEs methodd)          1722 and
   1732, for example as in Equation 1. For DL TTI#4 1740 and DL TTI#8 1750 (not included in TDD
   UL-DL configuration 1), a respective PUCCH resource in UL TTI#2 1760 for a HARQ-ACK signal
   transmission from UE 114 in response to a respective PDSCH reception (or SPS release) is
 5 determined using a different method (method2) 1742 and 1752. This different method can be
   explicit indication of a PUCCH resource, from a set of PUCCH resources configured to UE 114 by
   higher layer signaling, using the ARO field in a DCI format scheduling the PDSCH (or a SPS
   release) in a respective DL TTI.
 0 TTI-dependent UCI Multiplexing in a PUSCH
   In certain embodiments, a first method for improving a detection reliability of UCI multiplexed
   in a PUSCH is to link this multiplexing with an UL PC process used for the PUSCH transmission. If
   the UL PC process is the one used for PUSCH transmissions in a first set of TTIs, such as UL fixed
 5 TTIs (will be referred to as first UL PC process),UE 114 multiplexes UCI in the PUSCH. If the UL
   PC process is same as the one used for PUSCH transmissions in a second set of TTIs, such as UL
   flexible TTIs (will be referred to as second UL PC process), UE 114 does not multiplex UCI in the
   PUSCH. UE 114 can determine the UL PC process to apply for a PUSCH transmission either
   explicitly from a respective field included in a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH transmission or by
 0 configuration for a respective TTI in a frame or implicitly from a value of a field included in a DCI
   format scheduling a PUSCH transmission and also providing a different functionality (for
   example, a field indicating a CS and possibly an OCC for a DMRS transmission in a PUSCH where
   odd values can be also associated with a first UL PC process and even values can be associated
   with a second UL PC process). UCI can include HARQ-ACK or P-CSI or their combination.

   FIGURE 18 illustrates an example determination by UE 114 whether to multiplex UCI in a PUSCH
   depending on an associated UL PC process according to this disclosure. While the flow chart
   depicts a series of sequential steps, unless explicitly stated, no inference should be drawn from
   that sequence regarding specific order of performance, performance of steps or portions
30 thereof serially rather than concurrently or in an overlapping manner, or performance of the
   steps depicted exclusively without the occurrence of intervening or intermediate steps. The
   process depicted in the example depicted is implemented by a transmitter chain in, for example,
   a mobile station.
35 As shown in FIGURE 18, UE 114 detects a PDCCH conveying a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH in
   an UL TTI and determines a respective UL PC in operation1810. UE 114 is also assumed to have
   either HARQ-ACK or P-CSI to multiplex in the PUSCH. UE 114 examines whether the UL PC
   process is a first process or a second process in operation 1820. If the UL PC process for
   determining the PUSCH transmission power is the first process, UE 114 multiplexes HARQ-ACK
40 or P-CSI in the PUSCH in operation 1830; otherwise, if the UL PC process for determining the

   PUSCH transmission power is the second process, UE 114 does not multiplex HARQ-ACK or P
   CSI in the PUSCH in operation 1840.
   In a second method, for HARQ-ACK or P-CSI multiplexing in a PUSCH, this multiplexing is
 5 entirely prohibited, regardless of the UL PC process used for the PUSCH transmission, unless the
   PUSCH is transmitted in a same TTI as a PUCCH UE 114 would use to transmit the HARQ-ACK or
   P-CSI when UE 114 does not have any PUSCH transmission. If UE 114 does not transmit a UCI in
   the PUSCH, subsequent actions can depend on the UCI type. For HARQ-ACK transmission, UE
   114 can proceed in a same manner as when UE 114does not have a PUSCH transmission and
 0 transmit the HARQ-ACK in a PUCCH.
   FIGURE 19 illustrates an example determination by UE 114 whether to multiplex UCI in a PUSCH
   depending on a respective TTI according to this disclosure. While the flow chart depicts a series
   of sequential steps, unless explicitly stated, no inference should be drawn from that sequence
 5 regarding specific order of performance, performance of steps or portions thereof serially
   rather than concurrently or in an overlapping manner, or performance of the steps depicted
   exclusively without the occurrence of intervening or intermediate steps.      The process depicted
   in the example depicted is implemented by a transmitter chain in, for example, a mobile station.
 0 As shown in FIGURE 19, UE 114 detects a PDCCH conveying a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH in
   an UL TTI in operation 1910. UE 114 subsequently determines whether the UL TTI is an UL TTI
   where UE 114 can transmit HARQ-ACK or P-CSI in a PUCCH in operation 1920. If the UL TTI
   supports HARQ-ACK or P-CSI transmission from UE 114 in a PUCCH, UE 114 multiplexes HARQ
   ACK or P-CSI in the PUSCH in operation 1930; otherwise, if the UL TTI does not support HARQ
 5 ACK or P-CSI transmission from UE 114 in a PUCCH, UE 114 does not multiplex HARQ-ACK or P
   CSI in the PUSCH in operation 1940. For example, a TTI supporting HARQ-ACK signal
   transmission in a PUCCH can be an UL fixed TTI and a TTI not supporting HARQ-ACK signal
   transmission in a PUCCH can be an UL flexible TTI.
30 An UL DAI field included in a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH and indicating a number of PDSCHs
   for which UE 114 should multiplex HARQ-ACK in the PUSCH is not useful when HARQ-ACK is not
   multiplexed in the PUSCH. Utilization of the 2-bit UL DAI field in that case can be by either
   always setting the 2-bit UL DAI field to zero, so that UE 114 can check its value when
   determining whether the validity of the fields in a detected DCI format, or by using the 2-bit UL
35 DAI field as an additional TPC field in order to increase a number of TPC bits used by the CLPC
   component of the second UL PC process and enhance an accuracy of the second UL PC process,
   or for any other functionality related to PUSCH transmissions.
   FIGURE 20 illustrates an example use of an UL DAI field included in a DCI format scheduling a
40 PUSCH transmission in a TTI depending on whether or not UE 114 multiplexes HARQ-ACK in the

   PUSCH in the TTI according to this disclosure. While the flow chart depicts a series of sequential
   steps, unless explicitly stated, no inference should be drawn from that sequence regarding
   specific order of performance, performance of steps or portions thereof serially rather than
   concurrently or in an overlapping manner, or performance of the steps depicted exclusively
 5 without the occurrence of intervening or intermediate steps.     The process depicted in the
   example depicted is implemented by a transmitter chain in, for example, a mobile station.
   As shown in FIGURE 20, UE 114 detects a PDCCH conveying a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH in
   an UL TTI and including an UL DAI field in operation 2010. UE 114 subsequently determines
 0 whether the UL TTI is an UL TTI where UE 114 can multiplex HARQ-ACK in the PUSCH in
   operation 2020, for example using one of the previously described methods. If the UL TTI
   supports HARQ-ACK signal transmission from UE 114 in the PUSCH, UE 114 determines an
   HARQ-ACK payload to multiplex in the PUSCH according to a value of the UL DAI field in
   operation 2030; otherwise, if the UL TTI does not support HARQ-ACK signal transmission from
 5 UE 114 in the PUSCH, UE 114 uses the UL DAI field to complement a TPC field included in the
   DCI format in order to increase a number of TPC bits for closed-loop power control of the
   PUSCH transmission and enhance a respective reception reliability in operation 2040.
   Alternatively, the UL DAI field value can be set to a predetermined value such as '00' that UE
   114 can confirm before further considering the DCI format as valid. Alternatively, the UL DAI
 0 field value can be used for any other functionality related to PUSCH transmissions.
   In case HARQ-ACK is multiplexed in a PUSCH only when the PUSCH is transmitted in a same TTI
   as a PUCCHUE 114 would use for transmitting HARQ-ACK information when it does not transmit
   a PUSCH, the effective bundling window
 5   "adapt
   is different than a conventional one
     Msi
   as it was previously described. A mapping of an UL DAI field should also reflect an effective
   bundling window size
30       adapt
   Unlike potential resource collisions for transmission of HARQ-ACK information using PUCCH
   format lb with channel selection between UE 114, configured to operate with an adapted TDD
   UL-DL configuration, and UE 115, operating with a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration as it
35 was previously described, such collisions do not occur when HARQ-ACK information is
   transmitted in a PUSCH. Therefore, for UE 114 configured to operate with an adaptive TDD UL
   DL configuration, the ordering of HARQ-ACK information does not need to be modified by
   placing first HARQ-ACK information bits corresponding to a first set of TTIs and placing second

   HARQ-ACK information bits corresponding to a second set of TTIs. Instead, the ordering of
   HARQ-ACK information bits for respective TTIs is according to the timing described in Table 4
   for a TDD UL-DL configuration that is configured to UE 114 for transmission of HARQ-ACK
   information.

   FIGURE 21 illustrates an example effective bundling window size if HARQ-ACK is only
   multiplexed in a PUSCH of predetermined UL TTIs according to this disclosure. The embodiment
   of the PUSCH shown in FIGURE 21 is for illustration only. Other embodiments could be used
   without departing from the scope of the disclosure.
 0
   As shown in FIGURE 21, TDD UL-DL configuration 1 is used (bundling window size of
     Ms1=2    I)
   for illustration purposes only. In a conventional use of an UL DAI field, when eNB 102 schedules
   a PDSCH transmission to UE 114 in SF#4 2110, eNB 102 expects a respective HARQ-ACK
 5 transmission from UE 114 in SF#8 2120. Therefore, when eNB 102 schedules PUSCH
   transmission to UE 114 in SF#8, an UL DAI field with a value of 1 in a respective DCI format
   indicates that UE 114 shall multiplex HARQ-ACK for a PDSCH transmission (or SPS release) in
   SF#4. Similar, when eNB 102 schedules a PDSCH transmission to UE 114 in either or both of
   SF#5 2130 and SF#6 2132, eNB 102 expects a respective HARQ-ACK transmission from UE 114 in
 0 SF#2 2140 and when eNB 102 schedules PUSCH transmission to UE 114 in SF#2, an UL DAI field
   with a value of 1 or 2, respectively, in a respective DCI format indicates the number of PDSCHs
   (or SPS release) for which UE 114 shall multiplex HARQ-ACK in the PUSCH. Assuming that SF#8
   2162 is an UL flexible TTI, UE 114 does not support HARQ-ACK multiplexing in a PUSCH
   transmission in SF#8. Then, eNB 102 expects UE 114 to multiplex HARQ-ACK for a PDSCH
 5 scheduled in SF#4 in the first TTI after SF#8 where UE 114 can transmit HARQ-ACK in a PUCCH.
   In the exemplary case of TDD UL-DL configuration 1, that UL TTI is SF#2. Therefore, when eNB
   102 schedules a PDSCH transmission to UE 114 in either of SF#4 2150, SF#5 2152 and SF#6 2154,
   eNB 102 expects a respective HARQ-ACK transmission from UE 114 in SF#2 2160 and when it
   schedules PUSCH transmission to UE 114 in SF#2, an UL DAI field with a value of 1 or 2 or 3,
30 depending on whether a number of PDSCH (or SPS release) scheduled in SF#4, SF#5, and SF#6 is
   respectively, 1 or 2 or 3, in a respective DCI format indicates a number of PDSCHs for which UE
   114 shall multiplex HARQ-ACK in the PUSCH. Therefore, for UE 114 configured to operate with
   an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, a mapping for values of an UL DAI field is according to a
   configured TDD UL-DL configuration UE 114 considers in determining UL TTIs available for
35 transmission of HARQ-ACK.
   For A-CSI, if a transmission does not occur in a respective PUSCH, the transmission cannot occur
   in a subsequent PUCCH as a respective A-CSI payload cannot be supported by a PUCCH format
   used to transmit P-CSI and UE 114 may have another A-CSI to transmit in a next PUSCH
40 transmission. Therefore, for A-CSI, two alternatives can exist.

   A first alternative is to always transmit A-CSI in a PUSCH. As an A-CSI codeword is assumed to
   also include a CRC, eNB 102 can determine if it incorrectly decodes an A-CSI codeword. If the
   PUSCH transmission uses the second UL PC process, the A-CSI resources in the PUSCH can be
 5 larger than respective ones for a same PUSCH transmission using the first UL PC process.
   Therefore, multiplexing of UCI in a PUSCH can be further conditioned on the UCI type with
   HARQ-ACK or P-CSI not multiplexed in the PUSCH, under previously described conditions, while
   A-CSI is always multiplexed in a PUSCH when a respective A-CSI request field in a DCI format
   scheduling the PUSCH transmission indicates that UE 114 shall multiplex A-CSI in its PUSCH
 0 transmission.
   FIGURE 22 illustrates an example UE decision for multiplexing UCI in a PUSCH transmitted in a
   TTI according to a UCI type and the TTI type according to this disclosure. While the flow chart
   depicts a series of sequential steps, unless explicitly stated, no inference should be drawn from
 5 that sequence regarding specific order of performance, performance of steps or portions
   thereof serially rather than concurrently or in an overlapping manner, or performance of the
   steps depicted exclusively without the occurrence of intervening or intermediate steps.       The
   process depicted in the example depicted is implemented by a transmitter chain in, for example,
   a mobile station.

   As shown in FIGURE 22, UE 114 detects a PDCCH conveying a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH in
   an UL TTI an including an UL DAI field in operation 2210. UE 114 subsequently determines
   whether the UL TTI is an UL fixed TTI, or an UL TTI using a first UL PC process, where PUCCH can
   be transmitted as it was previously described in operation 2220. If the UL TTI is a UL fixed TTI
 5 (or an UL TTI where UE 114 can transmit HARQ-ACK in a PUCCH, or an UL TTI using a first UL PC
   process), UE 114 multiplexes HARQ-ACK and A-CSI in the PUSCH in operation 2230; otherwise, if
   the UL TTI is not an UL fixed TTI (or an UL TTI where UE 114 cannot transmit HARQ-ACK in a
   PUCCH, or an UL TTI using a second UL PC process), UE 114 multiplexes only A-CSI in the PUSCH
   in operation 2240.
30
   A second alternative is for UE 114 to always drop A-CSI transmission in a PUSCH that uses a
   second UL PC process or if the PUSCH transmission is in an UL TTI where PUCCH transmissions
   are not supported for UE 114. In that case, the 1-bit A-CSI request field that is included in a DCI
   format scheduling the PUSCH is not used. Utilization of the 1-bit A-CSI request field in that case
35 can be by either always setting the 1-bit A-CSI request field to zero, so that UE 114 can check its
   value when determining whether the validity of the fields in a detected DCI format, or by using
   the 1-bit A-CSI request field as a TPC bit in order to increase a number of TPC bits used by the
   CLPC component of the second UL PC process and enhance an accuracy of the second UL PC
   process, or by using it for any other functionality related to PUSCH transmissions. UE 114
40 behavior in this case is similar as the one described for the UL DAI field in FIGURE 20.

   Finally, although the previous descriptions of the various aspects of the first embodiment of the
   disclosure considered a PUSCH scheduled by a DCI format in a detected PDCCH, a same UE
   behavior (when applicable) can exist when a PUSCH retransmission is triggered by a PHICH
 5 detection. SPS PUSCH is assumed to be in UL fixed TTIs and UE 114 can follow conventional
   methods for multiplexing UCI in a SPS PUSCH.
   UCI Multiplexing in a PUCCH for a UE Configured for Operation with Adaptive TDD UL-DL
   Configuration
 0
   Certain embodiments consider multiplexing of two P-CSI reports in a same PUCCH. This is
   motivated from a need to support reporting from UE 114 of a first P-CSI corresponding a DL
   fixed TTI and of at least a second P-CSI corresponding to a DL flexible TTI and from a limitation
   of UL TTIs where a PUCCH can exist for P-CSI reporting (for example, only in UL fixed TTIs). It is
 5 assumed that UE 114 cannot simultaneously transmit UCI in two different PUCCHs.
   UE 114 can be configured by eNB 102 a first set of DL or special TTIs for determining a first CSI
   and a second set of DL or special TTIs for determining a second CSI where the configuration can
   be by using a bit-map of 9 bits to include a maximum of TTIs in a TDD UL-DL configuration that
 0 can be DL or special TTIs (TTI #2 is always an UL TTI). For example a bit-map can be {0 0 11 00 1
   1 0} where a value of '0' indicates a TTI in the first set and a value of '1' indicates a TTI in the
   second set. Alternatively, a bit-map can be defined in a same manner relative to the DL or
   special TTIs of a TDD UL-DL configuration eNB 102 configures to UE 114 for determining one or
   more UL TTIs for transmission of HARQ-ACK information.
 5
   As a P-CSI difference between a DL fixed TTI and a DL flexible TTI is in a respective interference
   experienced for DL receptions by UE 114, a single PMI suffices for both P-CSI reports and either
   the P-CSI for a DL flexible TTI or the P-CSI for a DL fixed TTI does not need to include a PMI.
   Therefore, a P-CSI reporting mode (defining whether PMI is multiplexed (see also REF 3)) can be
30 configured separately for a first set of TTIs, such as a set of DL fixed TTIs, and for a second set of
   TTIs, such as a set of DL flexible TTIs. This is applicable regardless of whether Time Division
   Multiplexing (TDM) is used for transmissions of a first P-CSI and a second P-CSI so that they can
   occur in different UL TTIs or whether these two P-CSIs are multiplexed in a same PUCCH (and in
   a same UL TTI). Moreover, UE 114 can compute a PMI only in a first set of TTIs or in a second
35 set of TTIs or combine a PMI computation using at least a TTI from the first set of TTI and at
   least a TTI from the second set of TTIs.
   It is therefore beneficial to support multiplexing in a same PUCCH of two CQls, corresponding to
   two different sets of TTIs that are configured to UE 114 by eNB 102, and of a single PMI
40 corresponding to both DL TTI sets, such as a set of DL fixed TTIs and a set of DL flexible TTIs. It is

   also possible, according to a configuration of a CSI reporting type to UE 114, for the P-CSI report
   to include only the two CQls for the respective two sets of TTIs.
   FIGURE 23 illustrates an example multiplexing in a same PUCCH of a first CQI corresponding to a
 5 first set of TTIs (such as a set of DL fixed TTIs), of a second CQI corresponding to a second set of
   TTIs (such as DL flexible TTIs), and of a single PMI corresponding to both sets of TTI s according
   to this disclosure. The embodiment of the TDD configuration 2300 shown in FIGURE 23 is for
   illustration only. Other embodiments could be used without departing from the scope of the
   disclosure.
 0
   As shown in FIGURE 23, a TDD UL-DL configuration 1 is used for illustration purposes only. UE
   114 computes a first P-CQI in a DL fixed TTI SF#5 2310 and computes a second P-CQI in a DL
   flexible TTI SF#4 2320 and a single PMI, in either or both DL fixed TTI SF#5 and DL flexible TTI
   SF#4, and reports the first P-CQI, the second P-CQI, and the PMI in a PUCCH in UL TTI SF#2 2330.
 5
   As the second CQ is likely to be better (higher) than the first CQI, since DL transmissions in a DL
   flexible TTI can experience UL-dominant interference (that is typically smaller than DL
   dominant interference experienced by DL transmissions in a DL fixed TTI), the second CQ can
   be reported in a differential manner to the first CQI with most values indicating a higher CQI.
 0 For example, the second CQI can be represented by 2 binary elements, instead of 4 binary
   elements used to indicate the first CQI, and the 2 binary elements can be used to indicate one
   smaller and three larger indexes for the second CQI compared to the index of the first CQI.
   Therefore, a second CQI for a second set of subframes can include a second set of values where
   at least one value in the second set of values is larger than the largest value in a first set of
 5 values, such as the set in Table 1, for a first CQI for a first set of subframes.
   In a first example, for a differential reporting of a second CQI relative a to a first CQ using two
   binary elements, a first value can indicate an index that is two values smaller (when applicable)
   than an index of the first CQI and second, third, and fourth values can be same, two values
30 larger, and four values larger than the index of the first CQI, respectively. Then, referring to
   Table 1, for a first CQI value indicating an index 4, the second CQ value can indicate a CQ index
   of 2, 4, 6, or 8. In a second example, for the second CQI, a first value can indicate an index that
   is same as an index for the first CQI and second, third, and fourth values can be two values
   larger, four values larger, and six values larger (when applicable, if the largest possible value is
35 not reached), respectively, than the index of the first CQI. Then, referring to Table 1, for a first
   CQI value indicating an index 4, the second CQI value can indicate either a CQI index of 4, 6, 8,
   or 10.In case of reporting more than two P-CSIs, remaining P-CSIs can be provided in a same
   manner as it was previously described for the second P-CSI.
40 Moreover, UE 114 can be configured with a different PDSCH transmission mode in a DL fixed

   TTI and in a DL flexible TTI including support of different modulation schemes. For example, in a
   first set of TTIs, such as DL fixed TTIs, a PDSCH transmission can be configured to use a first
   transmission mode or a maximum modulation order of 64 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
   (QAM) while in a second set of TTIs, such as DL flexible TTIs, UE 114 can be configured to use a
 5 second PDSCH transmission mode or a maximum modulation order of 256QAM. Therefore, in
   the first set of TTIs, Table 1 and Table 2can be used, while in the second set of TTIs, eNB 102
   can configure UE 114 to use either Table 1 and Table 2 or a modified Table 1 and a modified
   Table 2 that include support for 256QAM modulation.
 0 Instead of using a same PUCCH format for multiplexing both a P-CSI for a first set of DL TTIs and
   a P-CSI for a second set of DL TTIs as the PUCCH format used to transmit a single P-CSI (also
   referred as PUCCH Format2, see also REF 1), the multiplexing of the two P-CSIs can be in a
   PUCCH format (PUCCH Format 3) with structure such as the one described in FIGURE 7.
   Additionally, multiplexing of HARQ-ACK and of previous 2 P-CSIs can be supported by a same
 5 PUCCH format such as the one described in FIGURE 7.
   FIGURE 24 illustrates an example UE transmitter block diagram for HARQ-ACK, P-CSI for a first
   set of TTIs, and P-CSI for a second set of TTIs according to this disclosure. The embodiment of
   the UE transmitter 2400 shown in FIGURE 24 is for illustration only. Other embodiments could
 0 be used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In certain embodiments,
   the UE transmitter 2400 is located in the UE 114.
   As shown in FIGURE 24,assuming the structure in FIGURE 7, UE 114 transmitter encodes and
   modulates2410HARQ-ACK bits 2405 and P-CSI bits 2408 and multiplies the encoded and
 5 modulated bits with an element of an OCC 2425 for a respective TTI symbol 2420. The P-CSI bits
   include a PMI and a CQI for a DL fixed TTI and a CQ for a DL flexible TTI. After DFT
   precoding2430, UE 114 transmitter selects REs 2440 of a PUCCH RB 2450, applies an IFFT
   2460,inserts a CP 2470, applies filtering2480,and transmits the signal 2490.
30 FIGURE 25 illustrates an example eNB receiver block diagram for HARQ-ACK, P-CSI for a first set
   of TTIs, and P-CSI for a second set of TTIs according to this disclosure. The embodiment of the
   eNB receiver 2500 shown in FIGURE 25 is for illustration only. Other embodiments could be
   used without departing from the scope of the disclosure. In certain embodiments, the eNB
   receiver 2500 is located in eNB 102.
35
   As shown in FIGURE 25,eNB 102 receiver filters 2520 a received signal 2510, applies a FFT 2530,
   selects 2545 REs 2540 used by UE 114 transmitter, applies an IDFT 2550, multiplies 2560 with
   an OCC element 2565 for a respective symbol, sums outputs for symbols conveying HARQ-ACK
   signals and P-CSI signals 2570, and demodulates and decodes summed HARQ-ACK signals and
40 P-CSI signals 2580 to obtain transmitted HARQ-ACK bits 2585 and P-CSI bits 2588.

   As an interference experienced by a PDSCH transmission to UE 114 depends on whether a
   respective DL TTI is a fixed one or a flexible one, with the interference typically being smaller
   for the latter if a respective TTI in a dominant interfering cell in an UL one, a different PDSCH
 5 transmission rank can apply between PDSCH transmissions in DL fixed TTI and in DL flexible TTI
   with the rank for the latter being same to or larger than the rank for the former. Therefore, UE
   114 can provide a separate RI for a DL fixed TTI and for a DL flexible TTI. Similar to a P-CSI for a
   DL flexible TTI, a respective RI can be provided in a differential manner. For example, only 1 bit
   can be used for an RI report for a DL flexible TTI indicating whether a same rank or an
 0 immediately higher rank can apply for a PDSCH transmission in a DL flexible TTI. For example, if
   an RI report for a DL fixed TTI consists of 2 bits indicating a PDSCH transmission rank of 1, 2, or 4
   spatial layers and a RI value indicates 1 spatial layer, a RI report for a DL flexible TTI can consist
   of 1 bit indicating a PDSCH transmission rank of either 1 spatial layer or 2 spatial layers. As a
   TDD UL-DL configuration can remain valid for only a limited number of TTIs, UE 114 may need
 5 to report RI for a DL flexible TTI within a validity period of a TDD UL-DL configuration. Given a
   limited number of UL TTIs where such an RI report can be transmitted, it becomes beneficial to
   enable multiplexing of RI and P-CSI reports in a same PUCCH. Therefore, embodiments of the
   present disclosure further consider UE 114 supporting adaptation of a TDD UL-DL configuration,
   an RI report for a DL fixed TTI and a RI report for a DL flexible TTI can be multiplexed in a same
 0 PUCCH and can also be multiplexed together with a P-CSI report for a DL fixed T TI or for a DL
   flexible TTI.
   Extending Payload Support for PUCCH Format 3
 5 In certain embodiments, UE 114 configured for operation with an adaptive TDD UL-DL
   configuration can use a PUCCH Format 3 that can be configured to be transmitted over one RB
   or over multiple RBs depending on a UCI payload.
   UE 114 can be configured to transmit a PUCCH Format 3 over 2 RBs, for example at least when
30 TDD UL-DL configuration 5 is configured to UE 114 for determining TTIs for which UE 114 needs
   to provide HARQ-ACK information or at least when UE 114 transmits P-CSI together with HARQ
   ACK. By using 2 RBs, instead of 1 RB, for a transmission of a PUCCH Format 3, a respective
   resource overhead doubles but UCI payloads that can be supported with target reception
   reliability also practically double. In general, varying a number of RBs used for a PUCCH Format
35 3 transmission allows for scalability in a transmitted UCI payload for similar reception reliability,
   without dropping any UCI or applying excessive HARQ-ACK bundling, while maintaining a
   PUCCH Format 3 structure and maintaining a single PUCCH transmission from UE 114 in an UL
   TTI.
40 FIGURE 26 illustrates an example resource allocation for PUCCH Format 3 depending on a

   maximum total payload according to this disclosure. While the flow chart depicts a series of
   sequential steps, unless explicitly stated, no inference should be drawn from that sequence
   regarding specific order of performance, performance of steps or portions thereof serially
   rather than concurrently or in an overlapping manner, or performance of the steps depicted
 5 exclusively without the occurrence of intervening or intermediate steps.    The process depicted
   in the example depicted is implemented by a transmitter chain in, for example, a mobile station.
   As shown in FIGURE 26, UE 114determines a total UCI payload in operation 2610 to transmit in
   a PUCCH. This determination can be semi-static by configuration as UE 114 is configured a P-CSI
 0 reporting mode and is configured a TDD UL-DL configuration for HARQ-ACK transmissions. The
   UCI includes HARQ-ACK, P-CSI, or SR. For HARQ-ACK, UE 114 determines a payload from a
   configured PDSCH transmission mode (based on whether a PDSCH can convey one data TB or
   two data TBs), from a number of DL TTIs in a TDD UL-DL configuration assumed for HARQ-ACK
   transmission in case of operation in a TDD system, or from a number of configured DL carriers
 5 in case UE 114 operates with DL CA. If a UCI payload
     0UC
   does not exceed a predetermined threshold in operation 2620, such as for example 22 bits, a
   PUCCH Format 3 over one RB in operation 2630 can be configured to UE 114 by eNB 102 and
   UCI encoding can be by a first RM code, such as a
    (32,0       Uc)
 0
   RM code punctured to a
    (24,0       UcI)
   If the UCI payload exceeds the threshold, a PUCCH Format 3 over two RBs in operation 2640
   can be configured to UE 114 by eNB 102 and UCI encoding can be with a second RM code, such
25 as a
    (64,0       UcI)
   RM code punctured to a
    (48,0       UcI)
   RM code or a dual
    (24,0       UCI)
30
   RM code where each
    (24,0       UcI)
   RM code is applied over 1 RB. Alternatively, a convolutional code instead of a RM code can be
   used when UE 114 transmits UCI over two RBs. For example, when UE 114 transmits HARQ-ACK
35 without P-CSI, a payload may not exceed the predetermined threshold while when UE 114
   transmits HARQ-ACK and P-CSI, a payload can exceed the predetermined threshold. UE 114 can

   therefore have a first PUCCH Format 3 resource configured for the first UCI payload case and a
   second PUCCH Format 3 configured for the second UCI payload case.
   If a dual
    (24,0        UcI)
 5 RM code (with QPSK modulation) is used over 2 RBs, with each
    (24,0        UcI)
   RM code applied over 1 RB, it is possible to multiplex in a same RB a transmission of a PUCCH
   Format 3 from a first UE 114 transmitting in only 1 RB and a transmission of a PUCCH Format 3
   from a second UE 115 transmitting in 2 RBs. Moreover, when UE 114 determines a PUCCH
 0 Format 3 transmission over 2 RBs (based on a respective determined UCI payload), UE
   114interprets an indication of a respective resource in a DL DCI format as being applicable over
   2 RBs; otherwise, if UE 114 determines a PUCCH Format 3 transmission over 1 RB, UE
   114interprets an indication of a respective resource in a DL DCI format as being applicable over
   1 RB.

   As shown in FIGURE 27, in a first realization, UE 114 splits

   using QPSK modulation and a PUCCH Format 3 structure in each RB of two RBs, 24 encoded UCI
   bits from a first RM code in a first RB 2715 and 24 encoded UCI bits from a second RM code in a
 5 second RB 2725. In a second realization, encoded and modulated bits of a first

   Missed Detection of a PDCCH Conveying a DCI Format Adapting a TDD UL-DL Configuration
   In certain embodiments, UE 114 operating with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration does not
 0 detect a PDCCH indicating a new adapted TDD UL-DL configuration and eNB 102 that
   transmitted the PDCCH is aware of that event. For example, eNB 102 can be aware that UE 114
   is in a DRX mode in a TTI of the PDCCH transmission.
   When UE 114 operating with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration does not detect a PDCCH
25 indicating a new adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, UE 114 then can operate with a
   conventional TDD UL-DL configuration, or with a known to UE 114 TDD UL-DL configuration
   such as a previously configured TDD UL-DL configuration (possibly separate for DL reception
   and for UL transmissions), or attempt to detect PDCCH in every TTI (except TTI#2) and follow a
   respective DL or UL scheduling assignment (if any), until UE 114 later detects another PDCCH
30 indicating a new adapted TDD UL-DL configuration. However, in case UE 114 operates with a
   non-adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, UE 114 may not behave according to the non-adapted
   TDD UL-DL configuration with respect to its HARQ-ACK transmissions as there can be residual
   HARQ-ACK information corresponding to PDCCH detections during a last adapted TDD UL-DL
   configuration that UE 114 needs to transmit in a TTI occurring after a last TTI of the last adapted
35 TDD UL-DL configuration.
   To address the above problem, certain embodiments of this disclosure consider that a UE, such

   as UE 114, operating with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration and does not detect a PDCCH
   indicating a new adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, continues to transmit HARQ-ACK
   information using a same reference TDD UL-DL configuration, such as for example TDD UL-DL
   configuration 5, as when UE 114operates with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration. Even
 5 through DL or UL scheduling purposes, UE 114 operates with a conventional TDD UL-DL
   configuration after a last TTI of a current adapted TDD UL-DL configuration. The use of the
   previous reference TDD UL-DL configuration can be always applicable or can be restricted only
   to the first UL TTI of a non-adapted TDD UL-DL configuration. Moreover, the eNB 102 receiver
   can use this knowledge to improve detection reliability of a HARQ-ACK codeword by assuming
 0 that UE 114 places a NACK/DTX value in the HARQ-ACK codeword at each location
   corresponding to a DL TTI that is an UL TTI in the conventional TDD UL-DL configuration.
   Additionally, to improve detection reliability of a HARQ-ACK codeword transmitted using a
   PUCCH Format 3, UE 114 can rearrange the order of DL TTIs as it was described in the first
   embodiment of the disclosure by placing first HARQ-ACK information corresponding to DL fixed
 5 TTIs and placing second HARQ-ACK information corresponding to DL flexible TTIs (that are UL
   TTIs in the conventional TDD UL-DL configuration) as the former can convey actual HARQ-ACK
   information while the latter can convey only NACK/DTX.
   FIGURE 28 illustrates an example DL or UL scheduling and HARQ-ACK transmission for UE 114
 0 operating with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration followed by operation with a conventional
   TDD UL-DL configuration according to this disclosure. While the flow chart depicts a series of
   sequential steps, unless explicitly stated, no inference should be drawn from that sequence
   regarding specific order of performance, performance of steps or portions thereof serially
   rather than concurrently or in an overlapping manner, or performance of the steps depicted
 5 exclusively without the occurrence of intervening or intermediate steps. The process depicted
   in the example depicted is implemented by a transmitter chain in, for example, a mobile station.
   As shown in FIGURE 28, while UE 114 operates with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, UE
   114 monitors PDCCH in DL TTIs of the adapted TDD UL-DL configuration and transmits HARQ
30 ACK information following a reference TDD UL-DL configuration in operation 2810. After a last
   TTI of an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, as determined by UE 114 from a known validity
   period of the adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, UE 114 determines whether it has detected a
   PDCCH informing of a new adapted TDD UL-DL configuration in operation 2820. If it has not, UE
   114 monitors PDCCH in DL TTIs of a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration or in every TTI other
35 than TTI#2, but continues to transmit HARQ-ACK information following the reference TDD UL
   DL configuration in operation 2830. If it has, UE 114 monitors PDCCH in DL TTIs of the new
   adapted TDD UL-DL configuration and transmits HARQ-ACK information following the reference
   TDD UL-DL configuration in operation 2840.
40 The present embodiment can be modified in case UE 114 does not detect a PDCCH informing of

   an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration over one or more validity periods of an adapted TDD UL
   DL configuration. A validity period can include a number of TTIs or a number of frames. When
   there is no residual HARQ-ACK information corresponding to an adapted TDD UL-DL
   configuration, UE 114 can transmit HARQ-ACK information according to the non-adapted TDD
 5 UL-DL configuration. Therefore, UE 114 can determine a HARQ-ACK payload and an UL TTI for
   HARQ-ACK signal transmission, as described in Table 4, according to the non-adapted TDD UL
   DL configuration. UE 114 can also use a first PUCCH format to transmit HARQ-ACK information
   associated with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration and use a second PUCCH format to
   transmit HARQ-ACK information associated with a non-adapted TDD UL-DL configuration,
 0 where the first PUCCH format can be different than the second PUCCH format.
   Finally, when UE 114 operates with a non-adapted TDD UL-DL configuration followed by an
   adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, HARQ-ACK transmission in a first UL TTI of the adapted TDD
   UL-DL configuration can be according to a same method as for the non-adapted TDD UL-DL
 5 configuration, including a determination of a HARQ-ACK payload and a use of a PUCCH format
   for the HARQ-ACK transmission. For remaining TTIs during the adapted TDD UL-DL
   configuration, HARQ-ACK transmission can be according to a reference TDD UL-DL configuration,
   such as for example TDD UL-DL configuration 5. For example, when UE 114 transmits HARQ
   ACK information corresponding to DL scheduling during an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration,
 0 UE 114can determine a HARQ-ACK payload according to a bundling window size for a
   respective TDD UL-DL configuration and use a PUCCH format 3 to transmit the HARQ-ACK
   information. Conversely, when UE 114 transmits HARQ-ACK corresponding to DL scheduling
   during a non-adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, it can determine a HARQ-ACK payload
   according to a bundling window size for the non-adapted TDD UL-DL configuration and use
 5 HARQ-ACK multiplexing with PUCCH format lb to transmit the HARQ-ACK information.
   HARQ-ACK Feedback from a UE Regarding a Detection of a PDCCH Conveying a DCI Format
   Informing of an Adapted TDD UL-DL Configuration
30 In certain embodiments, UE 114 transmits HARQ-ACK information to eNB 102 regarding a
   detection of a PDCCH transmitted from eNB 102 and conveying a DCI format informing of an
   adapted TDD UL-DL configuration.
   As a PDCCH conveying information for an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration can be detected by
35 a group of UEs, UE 114 may not be able to determine a PUCCH resource (unique for UE 114) for
   a transmission of HARQ-ACK information informing eNB 102 whether UE 114 detected the
   PDCCH. In a first alternative, the PDCCH is transmitted in one or more predetermined TTIs and
   eNB 102 can explicitly configure using higher layer signaling, to each UE in the group of UEs, a
   PUCCH resource for HARQ-ACK transmission in response to a detection (or absence of
40 detection) of the PDCCH.

   In a second alternative, UE 114 can include such HARQ-ACK information together with
   subsequent HARQ-ACK information regarding PDCCH detections associated with DL scheduling
   from eNB 102. For example, when transmitting HARQ-ACK information using a PUCCH Format 3,
 5 as it was previously described, UE 114 can also include one HARQ-ACK information bit
   informing eNB 102 whether UE 114 detected (ACK) or failed to detect (DTX) a PDCCH indicating
   an adaptation of a current TDD UL-DL configuration or, in general, a PDCCH conveying DCI to a
   group of UEs. UE 114 can transmit a HARQ-ACK information bit regarding a detection of a
   PDCCH intended for a group of UEs in a predetermined location in a codeword conveyed by
 0 PUCCH Format 3, such as for example a first location or a last location.
   By providing eNB 102 with HARQ-ACK information for whether or not it detected a PDCCH
   conveying information for an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, UE 114 can improve its
   throughput in case UE 114failed to detect the PDCCH, for example as eNB 102 can know to
 5 avoid transmitting scheduling assignments to UE 114 in DL TTIs UE 114 considers as UL TTIs or
   UE 114 can avoid power consumption associated with decoding presumed PDCCHs in TTIs with
   an UL direction.
   FIGURE 29 illustrates an example transmission of HARQ-ACK information from UE 114in
 0 response to detection or absence of detection by UE 114 of a PDCCH intended to a group of
   UEs where the HARQ-ACK information is included with other HARQ-ACK information
   transmitted from UE 114 in response to PDCCH detections associated with UE-specific DL
   scheduling according to this disclosure. The embodiment of the transmission shown in FIGURE
   29 is for illustration only. Other embodiments could be used without departing from the scope
 5 of the present disclosure.
   As shown in FIGURE 29,UE 114 transmits HARQ-ACK information bits in a PUCCH in response to
   one or more detections by UE 114 of respective PDCCHs scheduling respective PDSCH
   receptions to UE 114. UE 114 includes in the PUCCH a HARQ-ACK information bit having a value
30 determined by whether UE 114 detected UE 114-group common PDCCH 2910. UE 114 also
   includes in the PUCCH one or more HARQ-ACK information bits in response to receptions of
   PDSCHs 2920. Finally, UE 114 also can multiplex in the PUCCH other UCI, such as P-CSI or SR, if
   any 2930.
35 Although the previous realization of the third embodiment of the disclosure considered that a
   HARQ-ACK information bit regarding a detection of a PDCCH transmitted from eNB 102 to a
   group of UEs is transmitted by UE 114 in a PUCCH that also conveys HARQ-ACK information bits
   regarding receptions of PDSCHs, the HARQ-ACK information bit can instead be transmitted by
   UE 114 in a PUCCH conveying only P-CSI and a resulting PUCCH format is referred to as PUCCH
40 Format 2a (see also REF 1). If UE 114 also conveys HARQ-ACK information bits regarding

   reception outcomes of PDSCHs, UE 114 can apply bundling to the HARQ-ACK information bits
   when UE 114also transmits a HARQ-ACK information bit regarding a detection of a PDCCH
   transmitted from eNB 102 to a group of UEs so that it transmits, together with the P-CSI, both
   types of HARQ-ACK information using, respectively, a second bit and a first bit and a resulting
 5 PUCCH format is referred to as PUCCH Format 2b (see also REF 1).
   Acknowledgement information from UE 114 regarding a detection of a PDCCH informing of an
   adapted TDD UL-DL configuration can also be implicit without a direct transmission of HARQ
   ACK information. As previously described, UE 114 operating with an adapted TDD UL-DL
 0 configuration is assumed to report two types of CSI; one for a first configured set of TTIs, such
   as DL fixed TTIs and possibly some flexible DL TTIs and another for a second configured set of
   TTIs, such as remaining DL flexible TTIs in an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration. This is needed
   because the interference conditions experienced by UE 114 can vary among DLTTIs depending
   on whether or not an interfering cell uses that TTI as a DL one or as an UL one. When UE 114
 5 fails to detect a PDCCH conveying a DCI format informing of an adapted TDD UL-DL
   configuration, UE 114reverts to a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration (non-adapted) that can
   be different than the adapted one. As UE 114 does not know the adapted TDD UL-DL
   configuration, UE 114cannot know of resources available for measuring CSI in DL flexible TTIs
   (does not have a valid resource for CSI measurement in respective set of TTIs) and providing
 0 such a CSI report to eNB 102 may not be useful as it is likely to be inaccurate and UE 114
   anyway follows a conventional TDD UL-DL configuration where it is not scheduled PDSCH
   transmissions in DL flexible TTIs. UE 114 can therefore set the CSI report for a second set of TTIs
   to a predetermined value, such as an Out-Of-Range (OOR) value. ENB 102canthen use the
   reported CSI value to determine whether or not UE 114 detected the PDCCH informing of a
 5 respective adapted TDD UL-DL configuration. Furthermore, when UE 114 is in DRX mode in DL
   TTIs where eNB 102 transmits the PDCCH conveying the DCI format informing of an adapted
   TDD UL-DL configuration, eNB 102 knows that UE 114 fails to detect the DCI format and UE 114
   can skip the CSI transmission for the second set of TTIs in order to conserve power and reduce
   interference.
30
   Interpretation of a DCI Format Field as an UL Index Field or as an UL DAI Field
   In certain embodiments, UE 114 configured for operation with an adapted TDD UL-DL
   configuration and with TDD UL-DL configuration 0 for operation with a non-adapted TDD UL-DL
35 configuration, such as when UE 114 fails to detect a PDCCH informing of an adapted TDD UL-DL
   configuration, can interpret a field in a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH as an UL DAI. Conversely,
   UE 114 that is not configured for operation with and adapted TDD UL-DL configuration and
   operates with TDD UL-DL configuration 0 always interprets a field in a DCI format scheduling a
   PUSCH as an UL index.
40

   For UE 114 configured for operation with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, using always a
   field as an UL DAI can result in a restriction that a PUSCH transmission can be scheduled only in
   a subset of UL TTIs. However, this restriction may not have a material impact in an UL cell
   throughput as UEs that are not configured for operation with an adapted TDD UL-DL
 5 configuration can be scheduled in all ULTTIs. Moreover, as previously mentioned for UE 114
   configured for operation with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, an UL DAI is needed only in
   a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH when the PUSCH is transmitted in an UL TTI where UE 114 can
   transmit HARQ-ACK; when the PUSCH is transmitted in an UL TTI where UE 114 does not
   transmit HARQ-ACK, the UL DAI is not needed and the field can serve as an UL index when TDD
 0 UL-DL configuration 0 is the conventional TDD UL-DL configuration.
   If eNB 102schedules a PUSCH transmission from UE 114 configured for operation with an
   adapted TDD UL-DL configuration and eNB 102 expects UE 114 to detect a PDCCH conveying a
   DCI format that indicates an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration, eNB 102 can use a field in a DCI
 5 format scheduling a PUSCH as UL index, at least in some TTIs, in case TDD UL-DL configuration 0
   is the conventional one and as UL DAI in case any other TDD UL-DL configuration is the
   conventional one. The interpretation of the UL DAI field is according to a reference TDD UL-DL
   configuration that is configured to UE 114 for transmission of HARQ-ACK information. If eNB
   102 does not expect UE 114 to detect the PDCCH, for example when UE 114 is in DRX in DL TTIs
 0 of the PDCCH transmission, both eNB 102 and UE 114 know that UE 114 operates with the
   conventional TDD UL-DL configuration for the next validity period of an adaptation of a TDD UL
   DL configuration. Then, if TDD UL-DL configuration 0 is the conventional one, the field can be
   assumed to function as an UL index in all TTIs (instead of functioning as an UL index only in the
   TTIs where UE 114 does not transmit HARQ-ACK information). For UEs that are not configured
 5 for operation with an adapted TDD UL-DL configuration and do not operate with TDD UL-DL
   configuration 0, the field in always used as an UL DAI.
   FIGURE 30 illustrates an example interpretation of a field in a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH
   either as an UL index or as an UL DAI for UE 114 configured to operate with an adapted TDD UL
30 DL configuration and with TDD UL-DL configuration 0 as the conventional TDD UL-DL
   configuration according to this disclosure. While the flow chart depicts a series of sequential
   steps, unless explicitly stated, no inference should be drawn from that sequence regarding
   specific order of performance, performance of steps or portions thereof serially rather than
   concurrently or in an overlapping manner, or performance of the steps depicted exclusively
35 without the occurrence of intervening or intermediate steps.      The process depicted in the
   example depicted is implemented by a transmitter chain in, for example, a mobile station.
   As shown in FIGURE 30, UE 114configured for operation with an adapted TDD UL-DL
   configuration and can receive a PDCCH conveying a DCI format indicating an adapted TDD UL
40 DL configuration, determines whether TDD UL-DL configuration 0 is the conventional TDD UL-

                                                    .JU
  DL configuration in operation 3010. If it is, UE 114interpretsthe field in a DCI format scheduling
  a PUSCH as an UL index when the PUSCH transmission in an UL TTI where UE 114 does not
  transmit HARQ-ACK information and as an UL DAI when the PUSCH transmission is in an UL TTI
  where UE 114 can transmit HARQ-ACK information in operation 3020. If it is not, UE 114
5 interprets a field in a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH as an UL DAI field in operation 3030 when
  the PUSCH is transmitted in an UL TTI where UE 114 can transmit HARQ-ACK information and as
  having a predetermined value, such as zero, when the PUSCH is transmitted in an UL TTI where
  UE 114 does not transmit HARQ-ACK information.
