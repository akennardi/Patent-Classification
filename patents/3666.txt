       ADHESIVE AND USE FOR ATTACHMENT TO MICROFIBER GARMENTS
Field of the Invention
[0001]     The present invention relates to an adhesive and its use for attachment of a
substrate or article to microfiber garments. The adhesive provides peel strength, loss modulus
and storage modulus properties suitable for this application.
Background of the Invention
[0002]     It is well known to utilize absorbent articles such as sanitary pads and liners in
underwear to absorb bodily fluids. Most commonly, the absorbent articles have one surface
with a positioning adhesive applied to it to attach the article to the underwear. Underwear has
changed over time from pure cotton fiber to cotton/polymer fiber blends. The size of the fibers
has also changed to provide improved comfort. Recently, microfibers have been introduced in
underwear.
[0003]     As a result of the change in underwear materials, conventional positioning adhesives
are not effective in holding absorbent articles in place. Therefore, there is a need for an
adhesive that functions well as a positioning adhesive for absorbent articles.
[0004]     United States Patent No. 7,842,022, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety,
teaches adhesives that are applied to a reference microfiber substrate. The adhesive survives
a first peel force of at least 0.6 N per 5 cm when measured from a microfiber substrate. The
adhesives exemplified for bonding to microfibers are hot melt silicone pressure sensitive
adhesives. A second adhesive is also taught. The second adhesive is conventional in that it
bonds well to conventional cotton fibers, but not to microfibers.
[0005]     Therefore, despite the disclosure of the reference, there is a continuing need for an
adhesive with suitable properties for attaching absorbent articles to garments.
[0006]     Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.
[0007]     It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the
disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.

Detailed Description of the Invention
[0017]     The adhesives and articles of the present invention can comprise, consist of, or
consist essentially of the essential elements and limitations of the invention described herein,
as well any of the additional or optional ingredients, components, or limitations described
herein. The term "comprising" (and its grammatical variations) as used herein is used in the
inclusive sense of "having" or "including" and not in the exclusive sense of "consisting only of."
[0018]     The terms "a" and "the" as used herein are understood to encompass the plural as
well as the singular.
[0019]     Unless otherwise indicated, all documents cited are, in relevant part, incorporated
herein by reference; the citation of any document is not to be construed as an admission that it
is prior art with response to the present invention.    Furthermore, all documents incorporated
herein by reference in their entirety are only incorporated herein to the extent that they are not
inconsistent with this specification.
[0020]     As used herein, the term "microfiber" means fibers, or fabrics containing fibers,
having a denier of not more than 1 (1 denier=1 g/9000 m of fiber) and a diameter in cross
section of not more than 10 pm. Microfibers are artificial man-made fibers and most typically
consist of polyester or polyamides, such as nylon. Microfibers are used by the fabric industry
for making very fine close woven fabric materials and knitted fabrics, which are characterized
by soft handle and breathability. Microfiber fabrics have very different physical characteristics
compared to conventional cotton fabrics.          Oftentimes microfiber garments also contain
elastan/LYCRA fibers for providing elasticity. Due to the small diameter of the microfibers the
density of the fabrics made therefrom is very high compared to the one of cotton fabrics.
Thanks to the small fiber diameter of those microfibers the void space between the individual
microfibers is very low compared to cotton fabrics.           Commercially available microfiber
materials are marketed by, for example, DuPont under the trade name TACTEL@ or by Nylstar
under the trade name MERYL@.
[0021]     As used herein, the term "non transferable to cotton" means that the adhesive does
not leave residue (or residue is not present) on cotton (as determined by visual inspection after
removing the absorbent article from the garment)
[0022]     As used herein, the term "absorbent article", in a very broad sense, means any
article being able to receive and/or absorb and/or contain and/or retain fluids and/or exudates,

                                                - 5
especially bodily fluids/bodily exudates.     The absorbent article, which is referred to in the
present invention typically comprises a fluid pervious cover layer as the wearer-facing surface,
a fluid impervious barrier layer as the garment-facing surface that is preferably water vapour
and/or gas pervious and an absorbent core comprised there between. Furthermore, absorbent
articles in the context of the present invention are provided with a means for their attachment
to the user's garment, in particular with an adhesive.       In certain embodiments, absorbent
articles in the context of the present invention are disposable absorbent articles.       Typical
disposable absorbent articles according to the present invention are absorbent articles for
personal hygiene, such as baby care articles like baby diapers; incontinence pads and
perspiration pads like underarm sweat pads or hat bands and such disposable absorbent
articles as those used for feminine hygiene like catamimials in the form of incontinence
products, sanitary napkins and/or panty liners. In certain embodiments, disposable absorbent
article is a sanitary napkin or panty liner.
[0023]      As used herein, the term "disposable" means articles which are not intended to be
laundered or otherwise restored or reused as an article (i.e. they are intended to be discarded
after a single use and preferably to be recycled, composted or otherwise disposed of in an
environmentally compatible manner).
[0024]      As used herein, the phrase "visual inspection" means that a human viewer can
visually discern the presence of residue with the unaided eye (excepting standard corrective
lenses adapted to compensate for near-sightedness, farsightedness, or stigmatism, or other
corrected vision) in lighting at least equal to the illumination of a standard 100 watt
incandescent white light bulb at a distance of 0.25 meter.
[0025]      As used herein, the terms "body fluid" or "bodily fluid" means any fluid produced by
the human or mammalian body including for instance perspiration, urine, blood, menstrual
fluids, vaginal secretions and the like.
[0026]      As used herein, the term "in use", refers to the period of time that starts when the
absorbent article is actually put in contact with the anatomy of the user (i.e., wearer).
[0027]      As used herein, the term "glass transition" or "Tg" means the temperature indicating
the relaxation in a polymer where a material changes from a glass to a rubber and is
determined by tensile dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) performed in the linear elastic
region of the material using parallel plate geometry with a gap of 1 mm at a frequency of 6.3

                                                - 6
rad/sec., using a temperature ramp method at a temperature ramp rate of about 1-2 C./min or
slower. The Tan delta peak temperature is taken as the glass transition (Tg) of the particular
material or phase.
[0028]      As said infra, an absorbent article in the context of the present invention comprises
the adhesive of the present invention for the attachment of this article to the user's garments.
The adhesive of the present invention in this context is also referred to as "panty fastening
adhesive" or "PFA".      The PFA is provided on the garment facing surface of the absorbent
article of the present invention, typically the backsheet, for attaching said article to the garment
of a wearer. Similarly, if the product is a winged product, the wings can also be provided with
PFA on the garment-facing surface in order to secure the wings to the wearer's garment.
[0029]      "Surface coverage" of a surface as used herein means that said surface is covered
by a material to a certain percentage.         For instance, 30% PFA surface coverage of the
garment facing surface of the absorbent article herein means that 30% of the total garment
facing surface of the absorbent article is covered with PFA. The garment-facing surface of the
article of the present invention can be covered with the PFA in a continuous manner, i.e. a
continuous coating of the whole garment-facing surface, or in a discontinuous manner, such as
by stripes, dots or very fine droplets of PFA.       For surface coverage herein the part of the
garment-facing surface of the article, which is actually covered by PFA material is taken.
[0030]      In certain embodiments the adhesive of the present invention has a surface
coverage on the garment-facing surface of the article of at least 30%, optionally 40%,
optionally 50%, optionally 60% or optionally 70-100% in order to achieve sufficient PFA-coated
area on the garment-facing surface of the absorbent article of the present invention for making
the bond to the garment material.
[0031]      All percentages, parts and ratios are based upon the total weight of the adhesive of
the present invention, unless otherwise specified.
Adhesive
[0032]      The present invention comprises an adhesive adapted to or suitable for adherence to
a microfibers.
[0033]      In certain embodiments, the adhesives are thermoplastic. As used herein the term
"thermoplastic" means an adhesive that repeatedly is transferable to a liquid or semi-liquid

                                               - 7
state by heating, and to a form-stable, essentially elastic state by cooling, within a temperature
range specific for the adhesive.
[0034]     In certain embodiments, the adhesives of the present invention are free or
substantially free of crosslinking. The term "substantially free of crosslinking", as used herein,
means that a substantial amount of the polymers in the adhesive have not undergone
crosslinking, as a result of crosslinking treatment or otherwise, and, therefore, do not suffer
from restricted molecular mobility which may tend to limit the extension of the polymer under
loading.   Accordingly, the adhesives of the present invention are also essentially free of
crosslinking agents. "Essentially free" as used with respect to cross-link agents is defined as
adhesives having less than 5% (or about 5%), optionally, 3% (or about 3%), optionally, 1% (or
about 1%), optionally, 0.5% (or about 0.5%), optionally, 0.1%         (or about 0.1%), optionally,
0.01% (or about 0.01%) or zero percent, by weight of the total adhesive, of crosslinking
agents. Commonly used crosslinking agents are detailed in US Patent No. 8,481,645, herein
incorporated by reference in its entirety.
First polymer
[0035]     The adhesive of the present invention comprises a first polymer either alone or in
combination with one or more additional polymers. In certain embodiments, the first polymer is
a soft or elastomer polymer/copolymer.          The terms polymer and copolymer are used
interchangeably as they relate to the soft or elastomer polymer. In one embodiment, the first
polymer is incorporated (optionally, in combination with one or more additional polymers or
additives [as described below]) such that the adhesive according to the present invention,
when measured by DMA testing method described below in Example 3, has a complex

(or about 1000) to 15000 (or about 15000), optionally, from 2000 (or about 2000) to 10000 (or
about 10000) Pa., or optionally, from 2000 (or about 2000) to 8000 (or about 8000) Pa..          In
another embodiment, the first polymer is incorporated (optionally, in combination with one or

to 40'C, at a frequency of 6.3 rad/sec. and shear stress of 1000 Pa., has an average decline
(i.e., the average difference in the resultant complex modulus (G*) value of the adhesive [at
40'C] from the initial complex modulus (G*)value of the adhesive [at 25'C]), of more than 25%,
optionally more than 30%, optionally more than 40%, optionally more than 50%, more than
55%.
[0037]      In certain embodiments, the first polymer is incorporated (optionally, in combination

1000 (or about 1000) to 10000 (or about 10000), or optionally, from 2000 (or about 2000) to
7000 (or about 7000) Pa.
[0038]      In certain embodiments, the first polymer is incorporated (optionally, in combination
with one or more additional polymers or additives [as described below])such that the loss
modulus (G") of the adhesive according to the present invention, when measured, by DMA
testing method described below in Example 3, across a temperature range starting from 25'C
to 40'C, at a frequency of 6.3 rad/sec. and shear stress of 1000 Pa., has an average decline

from the initial loss modulus (G") value of the adhesive [at 25'C]), of more than 25%, optionally
more than 30%, or optionally more than 35%.

[0042]       In certain embodiments, the first polymer is or comprises a styrenic block copolymer.
Examples of styrenic block copolymers include, but are not limited to, (or comprise) styrenic
triblock polymers such as styrene-isoprene-styrene tri-block copolymers. As is known in the
art, tri-block polymers (isoprene-styrene-isoprene) are a mixture of polymers comprising some
di-block polymer (styrene-isoprene) due to the nature of the polymerization reaction. In certain
embodiments, adhesives of the present invention utilize a tri-block/di-block polymer mixture

about 10%) to 50% (or about 50%), optionally, from 20% (or about 20%) to 40% (or about
40%), or optionally from 25% (or about 25%) to 35% (or about 35%), by weight, of the total
adhesive.

                                             - 10

may be used.      Suitable commercially available tackifying resins include hydrocarbon resins
such as ESCOREZ 5400 (cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon resin; softening point = 100'C) from
ExxonMobil Chemical       Company,     EASTOTAC      H100W (softening point =       100'C) and

30'C), or optionally, from 10'C (or about 10'C) to 20'C (or about 20'C) are used in the
adhesives of the present invention. Examples of suitable liquid tackifiers include, but are not
limited to, REGALREZ 1018 (softening point = 18'C) from Eastman Chemical, Kingsport, TN,
WINGTACK 10 (softening point = 10'C).
[0046]     In some embodiments, liquid rubbers such INDOPOL and polybutene (INEOS,
Switzerland) may also be used as the tackifying resin.
[0047]     In certain embodiments, the tackifying resin is a hydrocarbon resin.         In other
embodiments, the tackifying resin is a cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon resin.         The amount of
tackifying resin may range from 40% (or about 40%) to 70% (or about 70%), optionally from

                                            - 11
45% (or about 45%) to 65% (or about 65%), or optionally from 50% (or about 50%) to 60% (or
about 60%), by weight, of the total adhesive.
Plasticizer
[0048]     The adhesive of the present invention also comprises at least one plasticizer.
Suitable plasticizers include hydrogenated cycloaliphatic petroleum hydrocarbons, such as
REGALREZ@ 1018 from EASTMAN Kingsport, TN; and mineral oil or paraffinic oil, such as

second polymer in addition to the above mentioned (or, in this case, first) polymer. Polymers
suitable for use as the second polymer include, but is not limited to styrene-butadiene
polymers such as SOLPRENE 1205 (18% wt. styrene) from Dynasol Company, Houston, TX
and KRATON D1118 from Kraton Polymers, Houston, TX; and mixtures thereof.            In certain
embodiments, the second polymer is a styrene-butadiene polymer.              A more detailed
description of styrene butadiene block polymers can be found in US Patent 8,378,015, herein
incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[0050]     In certain embodiments, the second polymer generally has a has a melt index of less
than or equal to 12 (or about 12) grams per 10 minutes, optionally, from 1 (or about 1) grams
per 10 minutes to 12 (or about 12) grams per 10 minutes, or optionally from 2 (or about 2)
grams per 10 minutes to 10 (or about 10) grams per 10 minutes, as measured by ASTM

[0051]     When utilized, the amount of the second polymer may range from about 5% to about
20%, optionally from about 5% to about 15%, or optionally from about 5% to about 10%, by
weight, by weight of the total adhesive.

                                             - 12
[0052]     Optionally, the adhesive of the present invention may also incorporate conventional
adhesive compounding ingredients, such as stabilizers. Suitable stabilizers include, but are
not limited to, phenolic antioxidants such as hindered phenolic antioxidants, BNX-1010 or
BNX-1076 from MAYZO Company Norcross, GA or mixtures of such phenolic antioxidants. In
certain embodiments, the stabilizer is a hindered phenolic antioxidant. The stabilizer may be
added at amounts known in the art, for example from about 0.25% to about 2% by weight or,
optionally, 1% (or about 1%) by weight. The adhesive can be applied by die coating or other
means known in the art. Slot die coating is a continuous coating process that involves passing
the adhesive through a die onto the backing.
[0053]     In certain embodiments, the adhesives according to the present invention have a
peel strength to microfibers ranging from 1.96 (or about 1.96) to 4.9 (or about 4.9), optionally,
from 1.96 (or about 1.96) to 3.92 (or about 3.92), or optionally, from 2.45 (or about 2.45) to
3.43 (or about 3.43) N at an adhesive coat weight of 20 g/m2, using the T-Peel testing method
described below in Example 2 from a microfiber substrate
[0054]     In certain embodiments, the adhesives according to the present invention, when
measured by DMA testing method described below in Example 3, have a loss modulus, at
25'C, a shear stress of 1000 Pa. and at a frequency of 6.3 rad/sec., ranging from 1000 (or
about 1000) to 15000 (or about 15000), optionally, from 1000 (or about 1000) to 10000 (or
about 10000), or optionally, from 2000 (or about 2000) to 7000 (or about 7000) Pa.
[0055]     In certain embodiments, the adhesives according to the present invention, when
measured by DMA testing method described below in Example 3, have a storage modulus, at
25'C and at a frequency of 10 rad/sec., ranging from 1000 (or about 1000) to 15000 (or about
15000), optionally, from 1000 (or about 1000) to 10000 (or about 10000), or optionally, from
2000 (or about 2000) to 7000 (or about 7000) Pa.
[0056]     In certain embodiments, the adhesives according to the present invention are non
transferable to cotton as observed by visual inspection.
[0057]     In certain embodiments, when applied to the backing or barrier layer, the adhesive of
the present invention is applied at a coating weight of from about 1 g/m2 to about 35 g/m2,
optionally from about 10 g/m2 to about 30 g/m2, or optionally from about 15 g/m2 to about 25

[0058]      In still certain embodiments, the adhesives of the present invention are free of or
essentially free of silicone. "Essentially free" as used with respect to silicone is defined as
adhesives having less than 5% (or about 5%), optionally, 3% (or about 3%), optionally, 1% (or
about 1%), optionally, 0.5% (or about 0.5%), optionally, 0.1% (or about 0.1%), optionally,
0.01% (or about 0.01%) or zero percent, by weight of the total adhesive, of silicone.
[0059]     Without being limited by theory, it is believed that the presence of silicone negatively
affects the adhesion properties (or stickiness) of the adhesive.          Generally, the silicone
compounds migrate to the adhesive surface and produce a slippery feel as the adhesive
surface.
[0060]     The adhesives of the present invention exhibit adherence properties upon formation
of the formulation (as described in Example 1 below) and do not require activation, whether by
temperature or otherwise.
Absorbent Articles
[0061]     The adhesives of the present invention may be applied to absorbent articles that are
applied to microfibers or garments comprising microfibers.         The absorbent article typically
contains a cover layer having a wearer-facing surface, optionally an absorbent core and a
barrier layer having a garment-facing surface.
Cover Layer
[0062]     The cover layer may be made of a relatively low density, bulky, high-loft non-woven
web material. The cover layer may be composed of only one type of fiber, such as polyester
or polypropylene or it may include a mixture of more than one fiber.          The cover may be
composed of bi-component or conjugate fibers having a low melting point component and a
high melting point component.       The fibers may be selected from a variety of natural and
synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, rayon (in combination with other fibers), cotton,
acrylic fiber and the like and combinations thereof. The cover layer may have a basis weight in
the range of about 10 g/m2 to about 75 g/m2.
[0063]      Bi-component fibers may be made up of a polyester layer and a polyethylene sheath.
The use of appropriate bi-component materials results in a fusible non-woven fabric.
Examples of such fusible fabrics are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,555,430 issued Nov. 26,
1985 to Chicopee, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.        Using a fusible fabric

                                               - 14
increases the ease with which the cover layer may be mounted to the absorbent layer and/or
to the barrier layer.
[0064]     The cover layer has a wearer-facing surface which, when the absorbent article is in
use, contacts the user (i.e., wearer). In certain embodiments, the cover layer has a relatively
high degree of wettability, although the individual fibers comprising the cover may not be
particularly hydrophilic. The cover material should also contain a great number of relatively
large pores.     This is because the cover layer is intended to take-up body fluid rapidly and
transports it away from the body and the point of deposition.           Therefore, the cover layer
contributes little to the time taken for the absorbent article to absorb a given quantity of liquid
(penetration time).
[0065]     The cover layer may be treated to allow fluid to pass through it readily. The cover
layer also functions to transfer the fluid quickly to the underlying layers of the absorbent article.
Thus, the cover layer is advantageously wettable, hydrophilic and porous. When composed of
synthetic hydrophobic fibers such as polyester or bi-component fibers, the cover layer may be
treated with a surfactant to impart the desired degree of wettability.
[0066]     The cover may be made from a 16 g/m2 thermal bonded polypropylene fiber
nonwoven of the type commercially available from Polystar Company, Salvador, BA , Brazil
under product code 142250. Alternatively, the cover layer can also be made of polymer film
having large pores.      Because of such high porosity, the film accomplishes the function of
quickly transferring body fluid to the underlying layers of the absorbent article. A suitable cover
material of this type is commercially found on the STAYFREE Dry Max Ultrathin product
distributed by McNeil-PPC, Inc.
[0067]     The cover layer may be embossed to the remainder of the absorbent core in order to
aid in promoting hydrophilicity by fusing the cover to the next layer. Such fusion may be
effected locally, at a plurality of sites or over the entire contact surface of cover layer and
absorbent core. Alternatively, the cover layer may be attached to the absorbent core by other
means such as by adhesion.
Transfer Layer
[0068]     In certain embodiments, adjacent to the cover layer on its inner side and bonded to
the cover layer may be a transfer layer. The transfer layer provides the means of receiving
body fluid from the cover layer and holding it until the underlying absorbent core has an

                                                - 15
opportunity to absorb the fluid, and therefore acts as a fluid transfer or acquisition layer. The
transfer layer is, preferably, more dense than and has a larger proportion of smaller pores than
the cover layer. These attributes allow the transfer layer to contain body fluid and hold it away
from the outer side of the cover layer, thereby preventing the fluid from rewetting the cover
layer and its surface. However, the transfer layer is, preferably, not so dense as to prevent the
passage of the fluid through the layer into the underlying absorbent core.
[0069]     The transfer layer may be composed of fibrous materials, such as wood pulp,
polyester, rayon, flexible foam, or the like, or combinations thereof. The transfer layer 43 may
also comprise thermoplastic fibers for the purpose of stabilizing the layer and maintaining its
structural integrity. The transfer layer 43 may be treated with surfactant on one or both sides
in order to increase its wettability, although generally the transfer layer is relatively hydrophilic
and may not require treatment. The transfer layer is preferably bonded or adhered on both
sides to the adjacent layers, i.e. the cover layer and the underlying absorbent core. Examples
of suitable materials for the transfer layer are through air bonded pulp sold by Buckeye of
Memphis, Tenn., under the designation VIZORB 3008, which has a basis weight of 110 g/m2,
VIZORB 3042, which has a basis weight of 100 g/m2, VIZORB 3010, which has a basis weight
of 90 g/m2 and others.
Absorbent Core
[0070]     The absorbent article may have and absorbent core which is a blend or mixture of
cellulosic fibers and superabsorbent disposed therein. Cellulosic fibers that can be used in the
absorbent core are well known in the art and include wood pulp, cotton, flax and peat moss.
Wood pulp is preferred. Pulps can be obtained from mechanical or chemi-mechanical, sulfite,
Kraft, pulping reject materials, organic solvent pulps, etc.       Both softwood and hardwood
species are useful. Softwood pulps are preferred. It is not necessary to treat cellulosic fibers
with chemical debonding agents, cross-linking agents and the like for use in the present
material. Some portion of the pulp may be chemically treated as discussed in U.S. Patent No.
5,916,670 to improved flexibility of the product, which patent is herein incorporated by
reference in its entirety. The flexibility of the material may also be improved by mechanically
working the material or tenderizing the material.
[0071]     The absorbent core can contain any superabsorbent polymer (SAP), which are well
known in the art.      For the purposes of the present invention, the term "superabsorbent
polymer" (or "SAP") refers to materials, which are capable of absorbing and retaining at least
about 10 times their weight in body fluids under a 0.5 psi pressure. The superabsorbent

                                              - 16
polymer particles of the invention may be inorganic or organic crosslinked hydrophilic
polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohols, polyethylene oxides, crosslinked starches, guar gum,
xanthan gum, and the like. The particles may be in the form of a powder, grains, granules, or
fibers.   Preferred superabsorbent polymer particles for use in the present invention are
crosslinked polyacrylates, such as the product offered by Sumitomo Seika Chemicals Co., Ltd.
Of Osaka, Japan, under the designation of SA70N and products offered by Stockhausen Inc.
[0072]     The absorbent core may include between 50% and 100% cellulose pulp by weight
and 0% and 50% superabsorbent polymer by weight. In one example, the absorbent core is
constructed from about 93 % fluff pulp by weight, suitable pulp commercially available as
Golden Isles Fluff Pulp 420#HD 7% Moisture, from GP Cellulose, Brunswick, Georgia, USA,
mixed with about 7% superabsorbent polymer by weight, suitable SAP commercially available
as Aqua Keep SA70N from Sumitomo Seika Chemicals Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan.
Barrier Layer
[0073]     A barrier layer has a garment facing surface and is used to prevent liquid that is
entrapped in the absorbent article from egressing the sanitary napkin or liner and staining the
wearer's garment (e.g., undergarment). The barrier layer is preferably made of polymeric film,
although it may be made of liquid or fluid impervious, air-permeable material fluid repellent
treated non-woven or micropore films or foams.
[0074]     The barrier layer may be breathable, i.e., permits vapor to transpire.          Known
materials for this purpose include nonwoven materials and microporous films in which
microporosity is created by, inter alia, stretching an oriented film. Single or multiple layers of
permeable films, fabrics, melt-blown materials, and combinations thereof that provide a
tortuous path, and/or whose surface characteristics provide a liquid surface repellent to the
penetration of liquids may also be used to provide a breathable barrier. The cover layer and
the barrier layer may be joined along their marginal portions so as to form an enclosure or
flange seal that maintains the absorbent core captive. The joint may be made by means of
adhesives, heat-bonding, ultrasonic bonding, radio frequency sealing, mechanical crimping,
and the like and combinations thereof.
Other Optional Components
[0075]     Absorbent articles utilized in the present invention may or may not include wings,
flaps or tabs for securing the absorbent article to an undergarment. Wings, also called, among

                                              - 17
other things, flaps or tabs, and their use in sanitary protection articles is described in U.S.
Patent No. 4,687,478 to Van Tilburg; U.S. Patent No. 4,589,876 also to Van Tilburg; U.S.
Patent No. 4,900,320 to McCoy; and U.S. Patent No. 4,608,047 to Mattingly, each of which
patents is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.         As disclosed in the above
documents, wings are generally speaking flexible and configured to be folded over the edges
of the underwear so that the wings are disposed between the edges of the underwear.
[0076]     The absorbent article utilized with the present invention may be applied to the crotch
of the microfiber containing garment by placing the garment-facing surface against the inside
surface of the crotch of the garment.
[0077]     Any or all of the cover, absorbent layer, transfer layer, barrier layer, and adhesive
layers may be colored. Such coloring includes, but is not limited to, white, black, red, yellow,
blue, orange, green, violet, and mixtures thereof. Color may be imparted according to the
present invention through dying, pigmentation, and printing.       Colorants used according the
present invention include dyes and inorganic and organic pigments. The dyes include, but are
not limited to, anthraquinone dyes (Solvent Red 111, Disperse Violet 1, Solvent Blue 56, and
Solvent Green 3), Xanthene dyes (Solvent Green 4, Acid Red 52, Basic Red 1, and Solvent
Orange 63), azine dyes (Jet black), and the like.       Inorganic pigments include, but are not
limited to, titanium dioxide (white), carbon black (black), iron oxides (red, yellow, and brown),
chromium oxide (green), ferric ammonium ferrocyanide (blue), and the like. Organic pigments
include, but are not limited to diarylide yellow AAOA (Pigment Yellow 12), diarylide yellow
AAOT (Pigment Yellow 14), phthalocyanine blue (Pigment Blue 15), lithol red (Pigment Red
49:1), Red Lake C (Pigment Red), and the like.
[0078]     The absorbent article may include other known materials, layers, and additives, such
as, foam, net-like materials, perfumes, medicaments or pharmaceutical agents, moisturizers,
odor control agents, and the like. The absorbent article can optionally be embossed with
decorative designs.
[0079]     The absorbent article may be packaged as unwrapped absorbent articles within a
carton, box or bag.      The consumer withdraws the ready-to-use article as needed.          The
absorbent article may also be individually packaged (each absorbent article encased within an
overwrap).
Method of using the Adhesive

                                               - 18
[0080]     The adhesive of the present invention may be applied to a garment facing side of the
barrier layer for securing the napkin or liner to the microfiber containing garment during use.
The adhesive may be applied as strips, swirls, or waves, and the like. The adhesive may be
covered with removable release paper so that the adhesive is covered by the removable
release paper prior to use.     The release paper can be formed from any suitable sheet-like
material that adheres with sufficient tenacity to the adhesive to remain in place prior to use but
which can be readily removed when the absorbent article is to be used. Optionally, a coating
may be applied to release paper (or the packaging contacting the adhesive) to improve the
ease of removabilty of the release strip (or packaging) from the adhesive.          US Patent no.
5,181,610 to Quick et al. provides examples of coated packages used in lieu of release liners
in certain embodiments, which patent is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[0081]     From the foregoing description, one skilled in the art can ascertain the essential
characteristics of this invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can
make various changes and modifications. Embodiments set forth by way of illustration are not
intended as limitations on the variations possible in practicing the present invention.

[0083]     The adhesives are prepared according to the following steps:
Inventive Adhesive A

                                             - 19
[0084]      A suitable sized double arm bladed, sigma mixer (Teledyne-Readco, Serial 106830)
and bowl is cleaned and heated to 1750C.        At time zero, with blades running at 60 rpms,
400gm of ESCOREZ 5400 and 50 gm of BNX-1010 is added, followed by the slow addition of
the KRATON and SOLPRENE. At the 15 minute point, all the KRATON and SOLPRENE are
added and the ingredients are mixed until the mixture is uniform and homogeneous.          The
edges of the bowl are scraped as necessary. At the 90 minute point, the mixture is uniform
and homogenous, having no visible particles. The remaining ESCOREZ 5400 is, then, slowly
added with continued mixing. At the100 minute point, the KRYSTOL and REGALREZ 1018
are slowly added and the mixture is mixed until homogeneous. At the 120 minute point, the
mixture is homogeneous and poured into a silicone lined container.
Inventive Adhesive B
[0085]      A suitable sized double arm bladed, sigma mixer (Teledyne-Readco, Serial 106830)
and bowl is cleaned and heated to 1750C. At time zero, with blades running at 60 rpm, 400gm
of ESCOREZ 5400 and 50 gm of BNX-1010 is added, followed by the slow addition of the
KRATON. At the 15 minute point, all the KRATON are added and the ingredients are mixed
until the mixture is uniform and homogeneous.         The edges of the bowl are scraped as
necessary. At the 90 minute point, the mixture is uniform and homogenous, having no visible
particles. The remaining ESCOREZ 5400 is, then, slowly added with continued mixing. At
the100 minute point, the NYFLEX 222B is slowly added and the mixture is mixed until
homogeneous.        At the 120 minute point, the mixture is homogeneous and poured into a
silicone lined container.
[0086]      In the above described mixing procedures, efficient mixing in the double arm sigma
mixer is achieved by generating as much shear as possible. In the above procedures, a small
amount of tackifying resin (ESCOREZ 5400) is blended with all of the rubber until thoroughly
mixed.     Once this very high viscosity blend was homogeneous, the remainder of the
ingredients can be blended in and dispersed easily.

adhesives of the present invention on cotton and microfiber fabrics.
Materials and Apparatus:

                                               - 20
   *   Peel tester (Shimadzu Model AGS-X or Instrumentor's Slip/Peel Tester, Model
       SP1013.) capable of a 300 mm/minute peel rate, with jaws 55 mm wide to
       accommodate the full width of fabric and a load cell able to measure forces up to 10 N

   *   Microfiber fabric:     FG B CLON60TN STD LX04 (95% polyamide and 5% elastane
       (LYCRA)) supplied by: Brugnoli Giovanni S.p.A. Via C. Ferrini, 8 - 21052 - Busto
       Arsizio (Varese) - Italy, having a thickness is 0.48 mm and a basis weight of 170 g/m2
        5%.
Microfiber fabric sample preparation:
   *   The above Brugnoli microfiber fabric has a smooth side and rough side. The rough
       side is characterized by a regular patterned grid, while the smooth side has relatively
       very little pattern. The smooth side is used as the test-side.
   *   A piece of microfiber fabric, about 70 mm wide by 175 mm long (3"x 7"), is cut from the
       Brugnoli microfiber fabric.
   *   The microfiber fabric stretches and must be reinforced by the splicing tape backing. A
       piece of splicing tape, about 70 mm wide by 190 mm long (3" x 7.5"), is cut for the
       backing and is laid flat on a table, sticky side up.
   *   The cut piece of microfiber fabric is carefully laid on top of the splicing tape with the
       test-side up so as not to wrinkle or stretch the microfiber fabric.
   " The microfiber fabric is then firmly embedded into the splicing tape using a PSTC roller.
       To facilitate handling of the tape embedded microfiber fabric, the splicing tape is sized
       to so that a small amount of the splicing tape exceeds the length of the microfiber fabric
       for folding the excess tape on each lengthwise end over the lengthwise ends of the
       microfiber fabric.

    1. The release liner peeled back and removed from half of the film, adhesive and release
        liner composite strip.
    2. The exposed adhesive is gently placed on the fabric for testing (i.e., the cotton fabric or
        the microfiber fabric)
    3. The adhesive is pressed onto the fabric using the PSTC roller. The pressing process
        uses two passes. The strip is then rolled at 300 mm per minute using the automated
        roll-down device.
    4. Within one minute of rolling the fabric test sample, one end of each test fabric sample
        is inserted into the peel tester machine and peeling is started at a rate of 300 mm per
        minute (12"/min).
    5. The tail of the fabric test sample during the peel is positioned so as to maintain an
        angle of about 90 degrees.
    6. The average peel force is determined by the Peel tester by measuring the peel force
        over a distance of at least 100 mm (4"). The average peel force (in newtons) is noted
        from the display of the Peel tester machine.
    7.  Repeat steps 1 through 6 for each of cotton and microfiber fabric sample.
    8. The peel strength was tested on 5 cotton fabric samples for each tested adhesive,
        recorded and averaged.
    9. The peel strength was tested on 5 microfiber fabric samples for each tested adhesive,
        recorded and averaged.
