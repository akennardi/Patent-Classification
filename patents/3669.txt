Title       of   Invention:      METHOD      FOR     REMOVING      MANGANESE      FROM
WASTEWATER
Technical Field
 [0001]
           The present invention relates to a method for removing
manganese         from   wastewater        containing          manganese.         More
specifically, the present invention relates to a method for
treating           wastewater          containing           manganese         in       a
hydrometallurgical         process       using nickel         oxide   ore   as  a   raw
material.
Background Art
 [0002]
           In a hydrometallurgical process using nickel oxide ore
as a rawmaterial, operations such as that                  of PTL 1 are performed.
Specifically,        an acid, such as sulfuric           acid, is   added to nickel
oxide ore to leach out valuables,               such as nickel,       and an alkali
is  added to the obtained sulfuric             acid-acidic       leachate in     order
to separate most of the impurities contained therein,                         such as
iron,        aluminum,    manganese,         magnesium,         and    calcium,      as
neutralized products.             Subsequently, a sulfurizing agent is
added to the neutralized          liquid    in   order to separate and collect
valuables, such as nickel, as sulfides.
 [0003]
          When said process is       used, although a part          of the sulfuric
acid-acidic        wastewater after       sulfurization          (also referred      to
as "sulfurized solution" or simply as "barren solution") is
repeatedly used in the system, such as in the leaching step,
most of the wastewater is             sent to a wastewater treatment step
during which an alkali        is   added to neutralize          the remaining acid
while removing impurities etc. contained therein,                     and discharge
into the ocean etc. is performed thereafter.
                                           1

 [0004]
            Impurities that              need to be removed in             the abovementioned
wastewater           treatment           step       include      iron which       is     present      as
suspended           particles,           and       aluminum        and   manganese        which      are
dissolved as ions.
 [00051
           Among the above impurities,                        iron can be removed from the
wastewater by sending the wastewater to a thickener or the like
to     precipitate             and     separate          the   suspended      particles,            then
allowing the water to pass through a tailing                                  dam or the like,
thereby practically precipitating the particles completely.
Further,          a filtering           means,       such as a filter        press,       is   used in
combination if necessary.                            Aluminum can be removed from the
wastewater by adding an alkali                          to maintain the pH at a relatively
low level, thereby neutralizing the aluminum and removing it
from the wastewater as a hydroxide precipitate.
 [00061
            However,         manganese is           present in       a dissolved state           in  the
wastewater;            thus,       a precipitate            of manganese cannot be formed
unless the pH, which is adjusted through the addition of an
alkali       etc. to the wastewater,                    is  adjusted to an alkaline             region
with a pH exceeding 9.                    Accordingly,           there was a problem in             that
the removal of manganese from the above wastewater required much
time and cost.
           Another problem is                that,      in cases where an alkali             was added
to increase the pH,                   if   the pH exceeded 9,            magnesium contained
in     the wastewater               altogether            with    the   impurities         mentioned
above would form hydroxide before manganese did.
 [0007]
            Since there are no significant effluent                                standards for
magnesium and magnesium does not leave any impacts upon the
environment,              it    is     not     necessary         to   remove    magnesium           from
wastewater.              However, the alkali added with the intention to
remove manganese is                 consumed during the production of magnesium
hydroxide;            therefore,            the      alkali     is    required      in     an   amount
                                                         2

exceeding      the      amount         required        to   hydroxylate     the     target
manganese,     thereby generating unnecessary cost.                        Furthermore,
due to the precipitation                of magnesium,        the amount of generated
materials increases, which is not preferable.
 [00081
        Accordingly, the following operation has been carried
out: without increasing the pH of the wastewater to 9 where both
manganese and magnesium are precipitated,                        the pH of wastewater
is  adjusted to 8.6 or less                where magnesium is        not precipitated
and a small amount of manganese remains as an aqueous solution,
and the amount of alkali to be added is reduced in an amount
corresponding to the pH difference                         (see PTL 2).
 [00091
        According to this method, low-concentration manganese
remaining in       the wastewater is                removed by actively       oxidizing
the wastewater,         thereby effectively               preventing the increase of
the precipitate           and reducing the cost                for alkali.      However,
there had been cost issues regarding the amount of the oxidant
involved and the facilities etc.                        required for the reaction.
 [0010]
        In  particular,             in   industrial        wet  processes     of    nickel
oxide ore,    an enormous amount of ore is                    often treated      in    order
to separate and collect nickel which is contained by 1 to 2%
at most,   or even less.               Therefore,       an enormous amount of waste
water is   generated as well.                 Further,     as described above,         since
the wastewater is           treated       after     valuables,    such as nickel,         are
deposited      and      collected          in     a   reducing    atmosphere,         it   is
necessary to change the atmosphere from reducing atmosphere to
oxidizing     atmosphere            to   remove manganese          by oxidation.           In
order to advance the treatment in a short period of time, it
is  necessary to add a large amount of powerful oxidants,                                such
as sodium hypochlorite or ozone.                       Accordingly,     there had been
a problem in that the cost                     for the oxidant was required.
 [0011]
                                                  3

           Accordingly, as a method for saving the cost and time
required for oxidation,             an attempt has been made for treatment
methods using manganese-oxidizing bacteria.
           To remove manganese using manganese-oxidizing bacteria,
it    is  necessary to grow a certain           amount of manganese-oxidizing
bacteria,          and    enhance    the   removal      ability        of  the    grown
manganese-oxidizing               bacteria       to   oxidize        manganese      and
precipitate the oxidized manganese to form precipitates.
 [0012]
           In particular,      a large amount of wastewater may be handled
in      the   hydrometallurgical         method      of  nickel       oxide  ore,    as
described          above.       It   is   difficult       to    effectively        grow
manganese-oxidizing bacteria               suitable     for utilization        in  such
an environment.            There has been a demand for methods that                 can
be more reliably applied to wastewater treatment.

Advantageous Effects of Invention
 [0016]
          According to the          first invention, manganese-oxidizing
bacteria     are allowed to grow while a carbon source and an energy
source as cellular        constituents       are supplied, whereby manganese
can      be  sufficiently          oxidized    by  the   manganese-oxidizing
bacteria without supplying a large amount of alkali, and the
oxidized manganese can be precipitated and removed.
          According to the second invention,             the molecular weight
of the amino acid is           within a suitable      range;  thus, manganese
can be reduced without overly reducing the manganese oxidation
ability,     nor allowing sundry bacteria           to grow due to the excess
amino acid.
          According to the third           invention,   the amount of glucose
added is    within a suitable          range; thus, manganese can be reduced
                                            5

without weakening the activity         of manganese-oxidizing bacteria,
nor allowing sundry bacteria         to grow due to the excess glucose.
        According     to   the     fourth   invention,   the    manganese
concentration is      reduced in the preliminary step;          thus, the
addition of excess alkali       is  not required and the reaction     time
can be shortened, whereby providing advantages in          terms of cost
and facility.

[0018]
 (Technical principle of the present invention)
        The   method    for   removing     manganese   from   wastewater
according to the present invention is            a method for removing
manganese      from    wastewater        containing   manganese      using
manganese-oxidizing bacteria, and is performed by adding an
amino acid having a molecular weight of 90 or more and glucose.
The purpose of adding glucose is          to supply a carbon source and
an  energy     source    as   cellular     constituents   to   the   grown
manganese-oxidizing bacteria.            The purpose of adding an amino
acid is   to supply a carbon source and an energy source,          as well
as micronutrient elements,           such as other nitrogen sources.
                                       6

           When manganese-oxidizing bacteria are allowed to grow
while        a  carbon       source        and      an    energy       source       as     cellular
constituents           are      supplied,          manganese         can     be    sufficiently
oxidized by the manganese-oxidizing bacteria                                without supplying
a large amount of alkali, and the oxidized manganese can be
precipitated         and removed.             Since this        manganese removal effect
is    powerful,        it    is   possible          to    remove      manganese         even      from
wastewater in a low pH range                        (i.e.,      a pH of less than 9).
 [0019]
 (Manganese-oxidizing bacteria)
           Manganese-oxidizing                 bacteria         are    often       contained        in
wastewater; however,              when they are not contained in                      wastewater
or       are      contained            only         in       a    very         small        amount,
manganese-oxidizing bacteria                      stored beforehand are added to the
wastewater.
 [0020]
           Various types of manganese-oxidizing bacteria                                are known.
Compared        with      oxidation         using       a   single      bacterial          species,
collectively           handling         bacteria          obtained       from places            where
manganese-oxidizing                bacteria           grow      spontaneously,             such     as
actual wastewater treatment sites,                           is  more cost-effective               and
industrially           practical.              However,         when     various         bacterial
species        obtained on         site      are     handled       collectively,            various
useless        "sundry bacteria"               are     contained in addition                  to   the
useful manganese-oxidizing bacteria.
           As described above,              with regards to manganese-oxidizing
bacteria        which       contain        various          bacterial         species,          it  is
generally        difficult          to    precisely            analyze       and    specify        the
species         or     to      grow      only        specific         bacterial            species.
Accordingly,           in     the    present          invention,         bacterial          species
obtained         and       cultured          under         the    same        conditions           are
collectively          handled,       and various bacterial                   species are used
as a whole         to     remove manganese.                 Therefore, in           the present
specification, bacteria capable                           of    oxidizing manganese                are
collectively defined as "manganese-oxidizing bacteria,"                                            and
                                                    7

bacteria         not involved in        oxidation of manganese are defined as
"sundry bacteria."
            Moreover,        the manganese-oxidizing bacteria           cultured and
tested in the present invention were obtained from drainage
piping of a wastewater treatment facility                    of a smelter operating
in   Palawan,        Philippines, as described later;            however,     the place
of production is not limited to specific places.
 [0021]
 (Wastewater to which the present invention is applied)
             The manganese removal according to the present invention
is   targeted        for wastewater having a manganese concentration of
approximately 60 mg/L,               and is  suitable     for the reduction of the
manganese concentration to 60 mg/L or less.
 [0022]
            As    for     the     reasons   to     target    the   above     manganese
concentration, the following                   (1) and     (2) can be stated.
             (1) When a conventional manganese removal method where
an alkali is added to increase the pH is used, the manganese
concentration of wastewater can be reduced to approximately 60
mg/L even in           a region having a pH of less            than 9; however,          in
order to further              reduce manganese,       addition of an alkali          in  an
excessive           amount       exceeding    the     equivalent     amount       and    an
excessive           reaction       time   are    required.       Therefore,         it   is
advantageous              in    terms   of   cost     and    facility     to     perform
neutralization             so that    the manganese concentration is              65 mg/L
or     less,      preferably        about   60    mg/L,   and   then   to   treat       the
neutralized           wastewater using manganese-oxidizing                bacteria       to
reduce the manganese concentration to 1 mg/L or less.
 [0023]
             (2)  When an excessive amount of neutralizer                is  used,      the
pH of the wastewater increases excessively.                      This requires much
time andcost to, forexample, addan acidagain to the wastewater
which underwent manganese removal in                    order to adjust       the pH to

 (Conditions for maintaining the manganese removal ability)
         The following explains the conditions for maintaining the
manganese removal ability required to perform the manganese
removal        method          of     the     present      invention       using
manganese-oxidizing bacteria.
[0025]
         As   a    sample       liquid,    a    culture   medium    containing
manganese-oxidizing             bacteria     obtained    in    the  wastewater
treatment step on a site           performing hydrometallurgy of nickel
oxide ore was prepared.              Since manganese is contained in the
wastewater treatment step as described above,                  a proper amount
of bacteria adapted thereto are often present.
[0026]
 (Amino acid)
         The role of the amino acid added is          to serve as nutrients,
such as a carbon source,            an energy source,     and other nitrogen
sources, to help the growth of manganese-oxidizing bacteria.
         Low-concentration manganese and an amino acid having a
molecular weight of 100 or more in              a molar amount that    was 0.01
times to 5 times higher than the amount of manganese were added
to    the   above    culture      medium     to  prepare    a  sample   aqueous
solution.
[0027]
         Types    of    amino     acids   include,     for    example,    serine
 (molecular weight:          105.1),   leucine (molecular weight: 131.2),
aspartic     acid     (molecular weight:         133.1),   and glutamic      acid
 (molecular weight:          147.1).    These amino acids may be added in
the form of sodium salts.
[0028]
         Fig. 2 shows the molecular weight of the amino acid added
to the aqueous solution and the amount of manganese that can
be reduced,     that   is,    the manganese oxidation capacity.          In Fig.
2, the manganese reduction amount increases as the molecular
weight of the amino acid increases.
                                          9

           It   is    found that, in order to remove manganese with a
concentration difference of 60 mg/L,                       the amino acid to be added
is  required to have a molecular weight of approximately 90 or
more.       When an amino acid having a molecular weight of less                            than
90,    such as glycine having a molecular weight of 75,                                is  used,
the manganese reduction amount only amounts to less than 60
mg/L.
 [0029]
          When the amount of amino acid added and the manganese
reduction amount are                   compared using aspartic                acid having a
molecular weight of 133,                 it   is  necessary to add 3 mMol/L or more
of amino acid in order to reduce the manganese concentration
by 60 mg/L or more, as shown in Fig.                          3.
 [00301
           The addition of excess amino acid also contributes as
nutrients           for     sundry       bacteria        and     helps       their       growth.
Accordingly,             the    growth      of    the  target       manganese-oxidizing
bacteria is           inhibited, which is not preferable.
           Specifically,            if   more     than   approximately          4 mMol/L      of
amino acid is             added to wastewater containing manganese at a
concentration of 1.8 mMol/L                      (100 mg/L),      the excess amino acid
accelerates the growth of sundry bacteria.                                In addition, the
required cost is             equal to the cost for oxidation of manganese
through the addition of sodium hypochlorite;                              thus,   there is    no
advantage to use manganese-oxidizing bacteria.                                 Therefore,     it
is  preferable            to add 3 to 4 mMol/L of amino acid,                    as shown in
Fig. 3.
 [0031]
           That is,        an amino acid may be added in                  an amount within
a range of 1.6 times or more and 2.2 times or less                               relative     to
the number of moles of manganese.
          When       the    original        liquid     has     a   different        manganese
concentration, an amino acid may be added in a concentration
within        the        abovementioned             range     of     multiple         numbers.
Specifically,            for example,        as for wastewater containing 50 mg/L
                                                   10

 (0.91 mMol/L) of manganese,                 an amino acid within a range of 1.4
mMol/L to 2 mMol/L is added.
 [0032]
          It also seems plausible              to add amino acids having a higher
molecular weight or proteins;                    however,     if  the molecular weight
is   overly high, it        tends tobe        difficult      for manganese-oxidizing
bacteria      to   incorporate           such      amino    acids    as    nutrients.          In
addition,      such amino acids having a high molecular weight are
generally expensive and using such amino acids for industrial
wastewater treatment or the like                       costs too much,        and therefore
is not practical.
 [00331
 (Glucose)
          In  the    culture        medium        containing      manganese-oxidizing
bacteria,       glucose        (molecular weight:              180)    or    corresponding
hydrocarbon       is     preferably          added      to  the manganese-oxidizing
bacteria      as a carbon source as a cellular                     constituent,         and as
an      energy    source          as      a    cellular        constituent            for    the
manganese-oxidizing bacteria to work.
 [0034]
          As shown in        Fig.    4,    the amount of glucose added and the
manganese reduction amount have a linear relationship.                                     When
0.4 mMol/L of glucose is                added,      the manganese reduction amount
is   about 60 AMn        (mg/L),      and when 1 mMol/L of glucose is                   added,
the manganese reduction amount is                         about 75 AMn          (mg/L).
          As is clear from the above, it is necessary to add 0.4
mMol/L or more of glucose.                    This is      0.2 times higher than the
molar concentration of manganese contained, as with the case
of the amino acid described above.
          If the glucose concentration is overly low (e.g., less
than 0.4 mMol/L),          the activity           of manganese-oxidizing bacteria
becomes      weak,    and     the glucose            does   not   contribute          to their
growth.        Consequently,             the     manganese       reduction         amount      is
reduced.
 [00351
                                                 11

          On the other hand,           if  the glucose concentration is                  overly
high,      the   excess         glucose     serves     as    a   nutrient        for     sundry
bacteria,       resulting         in  the sundry bacteria             growing more than
necessary.          Consequently, the growth of manganese-oxidizing
bacteria     is   inhibited,         which is    not preferable.            In particular,
if   the amount of glucose added exceeds 1 mMol/L,                            the required
cost exceeds the cost for oxidation using sodium hypochlorite.
Therefore,        the amount of glucose added is                   preferably 1 mMol/L
or less.       This is       0. 6 times higher than the molar concentration
of manganese.
          That is,        it is preferable to add glucose                     in an amount
corresponding to a molar concentration that                          is   0. 2 times to 0. 6
times higher than the molar concentration of manganese.
 [00361
 (Preliminary step)
          It    is      also      possible        to    oxidize         manganese          using
manganese-oxidizing bacteria                  in   high-concentration wastewater
having a manganese concentration exceeding 60 mg/L.                                  However,
considering the size of a facility                    that     can culture        and secure
the large amount of manganese-oxidizing bacteria                               required for
the treatment and can also secure the reaction time required
for the manganese-oxidizing bacteria                       to advance the treatment,
an efficient method is such that the manganese concentration
is reduced with an alkali to a concentration of 60 mg/L as a
preliminary step,              and then the present invention is                  applied to
remove manganese using manganese-oxidizing bacteria.
Examples
 [0037]
<Example 1>
          About      1    g     (including       water)       of     sludge      containing
manganese-oxidizing bacteria                   obtained from drainage piping of
a    wastewater          treatment         facility      of     a    nickel       oxide      ore
hydrometallurgical plant                  owned by Coral Bay Nickel Corporation

located in Rio Tuba, Bataraza, Palawan 5306, Philippines was
collected and suspended in 250 ml                       of pure water.
 [00381
           Next,      1 mMol/L          (0.6   times   higher   than    the    amount      of
manganese) of glucose as a nutrient, and 4 mMol/L                             (2.2 times
higher than the amount of manganese)                     of sodium salt     of aspartic
acid having a molecular weight of 133.1 as an amino acid were
added, and the resulting solution was stirred.
 [00391
           Subsequently,               manganese       sulfate       in     an      amount
corresponding to a manganese concentration of 1.8 mMol/L was
added       to   the    solution         and   was   mixed  to  prepare      an   initial
solution.        The manganese concentration of the initial                     solution
was 100 mg/L.
 [0040]
           The initial         solution       was maintained at a temperature of
30C and was continuously stirred for 14 days.
           The concentration of manganese contained in                      the initial
solution showed an initial state where the concentration was
rapidly        reduced       from 1.8        to   1.4 mMol/L   (76   mg/L)     during      an
initial       time which is          about an hour from the start          of stirring.
After that, the manganese concentration was reduced to reach
the lower detection limit, i.e., virtually 0 mMol/L, over 14
days.
           That    is,     1.4     mMol/L      of   manganese   was   reduced       by    the
manganese-oxidizing bacteria for 14 days.

 (Evaluation of the activity of manganese-oxidizing bacteria
based on Example 1)
           The    above        results        of   Example   1   can    be   considered
attributable           to the added manganese-oxidizing bacteria                  growing
and acting to oxidize and remove manganese in the solution.

conditions as those of Example 1,                          except that        4 mMol/L of sodium

as the amino acid in                place of the aspartic                acid.       The manganese
concentration            in   this      case was reduced from 1.8 to 1.5 mMol/L
 (84 mg/L)        in  the initial            period, and then reached to the lower

concentration            in   this      case was reduced from 1.8 to 1.4 mMol/L
in    the    initial        state,         and      then     reached       0.9     mMol/L    14    days
thereafter.            The manganese concentration was reduced only by
0.5 mMol/L (27 mg/L),                 the activation            of the manganese-oxidizing

 (Evaluation of the amount of amino acid added based on Example
1 and Comparative Example 2)
           The relationship         with the amount of amino acid added shown
in  Fig. 3 demonstrates that             it is  desirable      to add approximately
3 mMol/L or more of amino acid in                   order to ensure a manganese
reduction amount               (AMn) of 60 mg/L or more.
           Compared with the initial           manganese concentration of 1. 8
mMol/L, it          is   desirable to add the             amino acid in an amount
corresponding to a molar concentration that                     is 1. 6 times or more
higher than the manganese concentration.

added as the nutrient.              The manganese concentration in this           case
was reduced from 1.8 to 1.4 mMol/L in the initial state, and
reached 0.4 mMol/L 14 days thereafter.                        The amount of change
in this case was 0.9 mMol/L                  (concentration: 52 mg/L).
 [0048]
 (Evaluation          of     glucose    addition       based    on   Example    1  and
Comparative Example 3)
           When Comparative Example 3 is compared with Example 1,
a reduction in           the manganese concentration can be recognized;
however,        the activation      of the manganese-oxidizing bacteria            was
insufficient          and the manganese concentration was reduced more
slowly than in          Example 1,     thereby confirming the efficiency            of
adding glucose.
 [0049]
 (Conclusion)
           The relationship         with the amount of glucose added shown
in  Fig. 4 demonstrates that             it is  necessary to add approximately
0.4 mMol/L of glucose in             order to achieve a manganese reduction
                                             15

amount (AMn)     of 60mg/L ormore.        However, the addition ofexcess
glucose results      in  adverse effects,      such as the activation      of
the manganese-oxidizing bacteria           slowing down due to the growth
of sundry bacteria as described above; thus, the upper limit
is preferably 1 mMol/L.
       Since the manganese concentration begins to decrease at
1.8 mMol/L, it is        effective to add glucose in an equivalent
amount that     is  0.2 times or more and 0.6 times or less            higher
than that of manganese.
Industrial Applicability
[00501
       The manganese removal method of the present invention can
be applied to the removal of manganese from various types of
wastewater,     and is  suitable    for removing manganese from a large
amount   of   wastewater,        such as   wastewater   produced      in  the

according to claim 1,
        wherein the amino acid is    added in an amount corresponding
to a molar concentration that       is 1.6 times to 2.2 times higher
than the molar concentration of manganese in the wastewater.
 [Claim 3]
         The   method  for   removing    manganese   from   wastewater
according to claim 1,
        wherein the glucose is     added in   an amount corresponding
to a molar concentration that       is 0.2 times to 0.6 times higher
than the molar concentration of manganese in the wastewater.
 [Claim 4]
        A method for removing manganese from wastewater,
         the method comprising,    as a preliminary step,    adding an
alkali    in  advance to wastewater containing manganese in       order
to adjust the pH so that     the manganese concentration is    reduced
to 65 mg/L or less,    and then subjecting the wastewater obtained
in   the preliminary step to the treatment according to claim 1.
