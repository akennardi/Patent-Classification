                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0005]     Periodontal infections and gingival inflammations are known to be major causes of
periodontal diseases. Both are chronic inflammatory diseases, and as they progress, the
periodontal tissue is destroyed and the alveolar bone is reduced due to bone resorption
causing loss of tooth support in some cases. In addition, the alveolar bone may become
defective due to perforations caused by surgical treatments or apical lesions from progressed
dental caries.
                              SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006]     The invention is directed to methods of using a sclerostin inhibitor to enhance
alveolar bone. In one aspect, described herein is a method of treating alveolar bone loss in a
subject comprising administering a sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., an anti-sclerostin antibody or
antibody fragment) in an amount effective to decrease the distance between the cement
enamel junction and the alveolar bone crest, optionally at a dose from about 5 mg to about
1,000 mg per week. In one embodiment, the sclerostin inhibitor is administered twice a week
for the duration of the treatment period. In another embodiment, the sclerostin inhibitor is
administered once a week for the duration of the treatment period.
[0007]     The treatment period can be at least about 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5
weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 9 weeks, 10 weeks, 11 weeks, 12 weeks, 3 months, 13
weeks, 14 weeks, 15 weeks, 16 weeks, 4 months, 17 weeks, 18 weeks, 19 weeks, 20 weeks, 5
months, 21 weeks, 22 weeks, 23 weeks, 24 weeks, 6 months, 25 weeks, 26 weeks, 27 weeks
28 weeks, 7 months, 29 weeks, 30 weeks, 31 weeks or longer (e.g., 8 months, 9 months, 10
months, 11 months, 1 year, 15 months, 18 months or longer). In some embodiments, the
treatment period is about 6-12 weeks. In some embodiments, the treatment period is 4-12
weeks, or about 1-3 months. In some embodiments, the treatment period is about 12-20
weeks, or about 3-5 months. In some embodiments, the treatment period is about 20-32
weeks, or about 5-8 months. In some embodiments, the treatment period is about 24-36
weeks, or about 6-9 months. In some embodiments, the treatment period is no more than
about 28 weeks. In some embodiments, the treatment period is about 1 year. In some or any
embodiments, the treatment period is no more than about 18 months.
[0008]     In some or any embodiments, the distance between the cement-enamel junction and
the alveolar bone crest is decreased by at least 10% (e.g., at least 10%, at least 20%, at least
30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% or
more) compared to the pre-treatment distance by six weeks after initiation of treatment. In

    WO 2013/101451                                                           PCT/US2012/068975
some or any embodiments, the distance between the cement-enamel junction and the alveolar
bone crest is decreased by at least 10% (e.g., at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least
40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% or more) compared
to a control subject (i.e., a subject with advanced periodontal disease that did not receive
treatment with the sclerostin inhibitor) by six weeks after initiation of treatment. In some
embodiments, the distance between the cement-enamel junction and the alveolar bone crest is
restored to the pre-disease state by six weeks after initiation of treatment. In some
embodiments, the distance between the cement-enamel junction and the alveolar bone crest is
less than or equal to about 2 mm (e.g., about 2 mm, about 1.9 mm, about 1.8 mm, about 1.7
mm, about 1.6 mm, about 1.5 mm, about 1.4 mm, about 1.3 mm, about 1.2 mm, about 1.1
mm or about 1 mm) by six weeks after initiation of treatment.
[0009]      In some or any embodiments, the alveolar bone height is increased by at least 10%
(e.g., at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least
70%, at least 80%, at least 90% or more) compared to the pre-treatment alveolar bone height
by six weeks after initiation of treatment. In some or any embodiments, the alveolar bone
height is increased by at least 10% (e.g., at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least
40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% or more) compared
to a control subject (i.e., a subject with advanced periodontal disease that did not receive
treatment with the sclerostin inhibitor) by six weeks after initiation of treatment. In some
embodiments, the alveolar bone height is restored to pre-disease state alveolar bone height by
six weeks after initiation of treatment.
[0010]      In some or any embodiments, the alveolar bone height is increased by at least 0.1
mm (e.g., at least about 0.1 mm, about 0.2 mm, about 0.3 mm, about 0.4 mm, about 0.5 mm,
about 0.6 mm, about 0.7 mm, about 0.8 mm, about 0.9 mm, about 1 mm, about 1.5 mm,
about 2 mm, about 2.5 mm, about 3 mm, about 3.5 mm, about 4 mm, about 4.5 mm, about 5
mm, about 5.5 mm, about 6 mm, about 6.5 mm, about 7 mm, about 7.5 mm, about 8 mm,
about 8.5 mm, about 9 mm, about 9.5, or about 10 mm) or more compared to pre-treatment
alveolar bone height or compared to a control subject (i.e., a subject with advanced
periodontal disease that did not receive treatment with the sclerostin inhibitor) by six weeks
after initiation of treatment.
[0011]      In some or any embodiments, the alveolar bone density is increased by at least 10%
(e.g., at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least
70%, at least 80%, at least 90% or more) compared to the pre-treatment alveolar bone density
or compared to a control subject (i.e., a subject with advanced periodontal disease that did not

    WO 2013/101451                                                           PCT/US2012/068975
receive treatment with the sclerostin inhibitor) by six weeks after initiation of treatment. In
some embodiments, the alveolar bone density is restored to pre-disease state by six weeks
after initiation of treatment.
[0012]      In some or any embodiments, the alveolar bone volume fraction (BVF) is increased
by at least 10% (e.g., at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at
least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% or more) compared to the pre-treatment
alveolar BVF or compared to a control subject (i.e., a subject with advanced periodontal
disease that did not receive treatment with the sclerostin inhibitor) by six weeks after
initiation of treatment.
[0013]      In some or any embodiments, the methods described herein may further comprise
measuring the bone mineral density of the alveolar bone prior to the administration of the
sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody fragment) to identify subjects in
need of treatment with the sclerostin inhibitor. Subjects presenting with alveolar bone
density measurements of less than about 750 Hounsfield Units (e.g., about 750 HU, about
700 HU, about 650 HU, about 600 HU, about 550 HU, about 500 HU, about 450 HU, about
400 HU or less) are identified as subjects in need of treatment with the anti-sclerostin
antibody or antibody fragment.
[0014]      The alveolar bone loss for treatment by the methods described herein includes, but
is not limited to, alveolar bone loss associated with periodontitis (e.g., advanced periodontal
disease), tooth loss, tooth extraction, denture wearing, oral surgery, osteolmyelitis,
osteoradionecrosis, developmental deformities (e.g., defects at birth such as missing portions
of the teeth, facial bones or jaw), sinus deficiencies, misalignment, or trauma (e.g., avulsed
tooth or jaw fracture). In some embodiments, the subject to be treated is suffering from
advanced periodontitis.
[0015]      In some embodiments, the alveolar bone loss is produced by removal of sections of
bone containing a tumor (e.g. benign tumor). Exemplary benign bone tumors include, but are
not limited to, osteoma, osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, osteochondroma, enchondroma,
chonrdomyxoid fibroma, aneurysmal bone cyst, unicameral bone cyst, fibrous dysplasia of
bone, and giant cell tumor of the bone.
[0016]      In some or any embodiments, the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g. anti-sclerostin antibody
or antibody fragment) is administered in combination with the use of materials that support
the regrowth of bone such as bone graft, bone dust, bone chips, demineralized bone matrix,
bone scaffolds, prosthesis, metal stabilizers, or bone scaffold substances comprising one or
                                                   A

   WO 2013/101451                                                           PCT/US2012/068975
more of polymers, ceramics, cement and calcium phosphates-based bone-graft substitutes.
Many variations of such materials are known in the art.
[0017]     In some or any embodiments, the method comprises administering a standard of
care therapy for the treatment of the periodontal disease to the subject prior to administering
the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody fragment). For example, in
some embodiments, the standard of care therapy for the treatment of periodontal disease is a
therapeutic, including but not limited to, Periostat@ and/or chemically modified tetracycline
3 (CMT-3). In some embodiments, the standard of care therapy comprises oral irrigation
and/or scaling and supra- and/or sub-gingival debridement (e.g., removal of microbial plaque
and calculus) of the affected area of the subject. In some embodiments, the standard of care
comprises performing oral irrigation and/or scaling and debridement of the affected area in
combination with Periostat and/or CMT-3 prior to administration of the sclerostin inhibitor.
In some embodiments, the method comprises administering the standard of care therapy
concurrently with the administration of the sclerostin inhibitor. In other embodiments, the
standard of care therapy is administered sequentially. For example, the standard of care
therapy can be administered 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3
weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks or more prior to administering the
sclerostin inhibitor to the subject. In preferred embodiments, the periodontal disease
progression in the subject is slowed, halted or reversed prior to administration of the
sclerostin inhibitor.
[0018]     In some or any embodiments, the method further comprises administering an
antibiotic, such as an antibiotic selected from the group consisting of amoxicillin, tetracycline
hydrochloride, doxycycline, minocycline, azithromycin, roxithromycin, moxifloxacin,
ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. In some embodiments, the method comprises administering
the antibiotic to the subject prior to administering or after administering the sclerostin
inhibitor to the subject. In other embodiments, the method comprises administering the
antibiotic to the subject concurrently with the administration of the sclerostin inhibitor.
[0019]     In some or any embodiments, the method further comprises administering a second
bone-enhancing therapeutic for the treatment of decreased bone mineral density or bone
fracture. Many therapeutics of this type are known in the art. In some embodiments, the
bone-enhancing therapeutic is selected from the group consisting of an anti-resorptive drug, a
bone-forming agent, an estrogen receptor modulator (including, but not limited to, raloxifene,
bazedoxifene and lasofoxifene) and a drug that has an inhibitory effect on osteoclasts. In
some embodiments, the second bone-enhancing agent is selected from the group consisting
                                                   C

of, a bisphosphonate (including, but not limited to, alendronate sodium (FOSAMAX@),
risedronate, ibandronate sodium (BONIVA@) and zoledronic acid (RECLAST®)), an
estrogen or estrogen analogue, a calcium source, Tibolone, calcitonin, a calcitriol and
hormone replacement therapy. In some embodiments, the second bone-enhancing agent
includes, but is not limited to parathyroid hormone (PTH) or a peptide fragment thereof,
PTH-related protein (PTHrp), bone morphogenetic protein, osteogenin, NaF, a PGE 2 agonist,
a statin, an anti-DKK1 antibody or inhibitor, an anti-RANK ligand (RANKL) antibody (e.g.,
PROLIA@) or RANKL inhibitor, strontium ranelate, vitamin D, or a vitamin D derivative or
mimic thereof. In some embodiments, the second bone-enhancing agent is Forteo@
(Teriparatide, or recombinant human parathyroid hormone analog (1-34)) or Preotact@
(parathyroid hormone). In some or any embodiments, the bone-enhancing agent is
Protelos@.
[0020]     In some embodiments, the second bone-enhancing agent is administered
concurrently with the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., for a length of time within the treatment
period). In other embodiments, the second bone-enhancing agent is administered for a length
of time once the treatment period with the sclerostin inhibitor has ended (i.e., for a
maintenance period). In such embodiments, the second bone-enhancing agent is
administered for a maintenance period of about 1 week to about 5 years.
[0021]     The method may further comprise subsequently administering one or more amounts
of a sclerostin inhibitor effective to maintain bone mineral density, optionally for a
maintenance period of at least about 12 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5
years or longer (e.g., over the lifetime of the subject) after the treatment period has ended.
[0022]     Periodontal disease treatment plans may also include supportive follow-up therapy
after active treatment is completed. Supportive follow-up therapies include, but are not
limited to mechanical debridement, reinforcement of oral hygiene (e.g., regular professional
cleanings, daily brushing and flossing) and administration of antibiotics.
[0023]     In any of the embodiments disclosed herein, the sclerostin inhibitor is optionally a
sclerostin binding agent (e.g., an anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody fragment). The use of a
sclerostin binding agent disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007/0110747 in any of the
methods disclosed herein or for preparation of medicaments for administration according to
any of the methods disclosed herein is specifically contemplated. One or more doses of the
sclerostin inhibitor are administered in an amount and for a time effective to treat alveolar
bone loss. In various embodiments, one or more doses comprising from about 50 milligrams
                                                  I-

about 700 mg, about 750 mg, about 800 mg, about 850 mg, about 900 mg, about 950 mg or
up to about 1,000 mg of sclerostin inhibitor. Ranges between any and all of these endpoints
are also contemplated, e.g. about 50 mg to about 80 mg, about 70 mg to about 140 mg, about
75 mg to about 100 mg, about 100 mg to about 150 mg, about 140 mg to about 210 mg, or
about 150 mg to about 200 mg, or about 280 to about 410 mg. The dose is administered at
any interval, such as multiple times a week (e.g., twice or three times per week), once a week,
once every two weeks, once every three weeks, or once every four weeks. In some or any
embodiments, a dose of sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody
fragment) ranging from about 120 mg to about 210 mg is administered twice a week. In
some or any embodiments, a dose of about 140 mg of the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti
sclerostin antibody or antibody fragment) is administered twice a week.
[0024]     In some embodiments, the one or more doses of sclerostin inhibitor can comprise
between about 0.1 to about 50 milligrams (e.g., between about 5 and about 50 milligrams), or
about 1 to about 100 milligrams, of sclerostin inhibitor per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg).
For example, the dose of sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody
fragment) may comprise at least about 0.1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, about 2 mg/kg, about
3 mg/kg, about 4 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg, about 6 mg/kg, about 7 mg/kg, about 8 mg/kg, about

31 weeks or longer (e.g., 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, 1 year, 15 months, 18
months or longer).
 [0026]     In some or any embodiments, the sclerostin inhibitor is administered
 subcutaneously. In other embodiments, the sclerostin inhibitor is administered locally to the
jaw of the subject. In some or any embodiments, the sclerostin inhibitor is administered
locally to the diseased gingival area of the subject. In some or any embodiments, the
 sclerostin inhibitor is administered to the periodontal pocket of the subject.
 [0027]     The sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody fragment) may be
also used in the preparation of a medicament for administration to a subject with alveolar
bone loss using any of the dosing and/or timing regimens described herein. Thus, the
invention also contemplates sclerostin inhibitor for use according to any of the dosing and/or
timing regimens described herein. Optionally, the sclerostin inhibitor is presented in a
container, such as a single dose or multidose vial or syringe. The invention includes a
container comprising anti-sclerostin antibody or fragment thereof and instructions for
administering the antibody or fragment thereof for treating alveolar bone loss according to
any of the dosing and/or timing regimens described herein.
 [0028]     In various embodiments, the sclerostin inhibitor is a sclerostin binding agent, e.g.,

                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0040]     The invention is predicated, at least in part, on the discovery that sclerostin
inhibitors can treat alveolar bone loss associated with, for example, periodontal disease. In
this regard, the invention provides a method of treating alveolar bone loss. The method
comprises administering to a subject (e.g., a mammal, such as a human) one or more doses of
a sclerostin inhibitor, such as sclerostin binding agent (e.g., an anti-sclerostin antibody or
antibody fragment), during a treatment period in an amount effect to decrease the distance
between the cement-enamel junction and the alveolar bone crest. The materials and methods
of the invention are superior to existing therapies whose therapeutic efficacy relies upon
invasive surgical methods (e.g., bone grafts) to restore the alveolar bone of the subject to pre
disease conditions (e.g., height and/or density and/or three-dimensional bone mass).
[0041]     The alveolar bone loss for treatment by the methods described herein includes, but
is not limited to, alveolar bone loss associated with periodontitis, tooth loss, tooth extraction,
denture wearing, oral surgery, osteolmyelitis, osteoradionecrosis, developmental deformaties
(e.g., defects at birth such as missing portions of the teeth, facial bones or jaw), sinus
deficiencies, misalignment or trauma (e.g., avulsed tooth or jaw fracture). In some
embodiments, the subject to be treated is suffering from advanced periodontitis.
[0042]     The term "periodontal disease" as used herein is meant to encompass a spectrum of
clinical conditions. The clinical diagnosis of periodontal disease is based on visual and
radiographic assessment of the periodontal tissues and on measurements of the space between
the tooth and the gum. In humans, these spaces are normally 1-3 mm in depth, and deepen as
supporting connective tissue and bone are lost. During a comprehensive clinical
examination, pocket depths and tissue support are measured at various locations (e.g., 4-6
locations) around every tooth and the amount of plaque, dental calculus, gingival bleeding
                                                 11

    WO 2013/101451                                                          PCT/US2012/068975
and exudates are recorded. Dental radiographs are routinely used to assess the amount of
bone support for the teeth.
[0043]     The severity of the periodontal disease is usually based on the clinical attachment
loss (CALs) measured from the cement-enamel junction or crown margin and may be
considered mild (1-2 mm), moderate (3-4 mm), or severe (>5 mm). The term "clinical
attachment loss" (CAL) refers to the distance, measured in millimeters, from the cement
enamel junction (i.e. crown margin) to the apical gingival margin. Periodontal disease may
also be characterized by pocket probing depths, with mild disease characterized by a
periodontal pocket probing depth of about 4-5 mm, moderate disease characterized by pocket
probing depths of about 6-7 mm and severe disease characterized by pocket probing depths of
about > 8 mm. The term periodontal "pocket probing depth" (PPD) refers to the distance,
measured in millimeters, from the cement-enamel junction (i.e., crown margin) to the
alveolar bone crest. Both PPD and CAL measurements are made with a periodontal probe at
various sites around each tooth, for example the mesiobuccal or midbuccal sites. They
provide a measure of the severity of periodontal disease. Alternatively, both PPD and CAL
can be obtained from standard digital radiography with some anatomical landmarks.
[0044]     Periodontal disease includes, but not limited to, plaque-induced and non-plaque
induced gingival diseases; chronic periodontitis (classified as slight (1-2 mm CAL), moderate
(3-4 mm CAL), or severe (> 5 mm) of generalized or localized involvement; aggressive
periodontitis (classified as (1-2 mm CAL), moderate (3-4 mm CAL), or severe (> 5 mm) of
generalized or localized involvement); periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic diseases
associated with hematologic disorders and genetic disorders; necrotizing periodontal diseases
including necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis; abcesses
of the periodontium including gingival, periodontal and pericoronal abscesses; periodontitis
associated with endodontic lesions; and developmental or acquired deformities and
conditions, for example, localized tooth-related factors that modify or predispose to plaque
induced gingival diseases or periodontitis, mucogingival deformities and conditions around
teeth, and conditions on edentulous ridges and occlusal trauma. All of these conditions may
be localized to one or a few specific teeth, or more generalized (i.e., >30% of sites are
involved).
[0045]     The term "advanced periodontal disease" as used herein refers to a subject
presenting with a CAL of > 5 mm or a periodontal PPD of > 8 mm. Gingival recession,
drifting of teeth, mobility and suppuration are signs that are often associated with advanced
periodontal disease due to progressive destruction of the alveolar bone.

    WO 2013/101451                                                             PCT/US2012/068975
[0046]     In some embodiments, the alveolar bone loss is produced by removal of sections of
bone containing a benign tumor. Exemplary benign bone tumors include, but are not limited
to, osteoma, osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, osteochondroma, enchondroma,
chonrdomyxoid fibroma, aneurysmal bone cyst, unicameral bone cyst, fibrous dysplasia of
bone and giant cell tumor of the bone.
[0047]     Administration of the sclerostin inhibitor increases one or more parameters of
alveolar bone (e.g., one or more of alveolar bone height, alveolar bone mass, alveolar bone
density, alveolar bone volume, alveolar bone mineral content, and improved tooth stability).
In this regard, "treating" alveolar bone loss includes, for example, any increase in alveolar
bone height, alveolar bone mass, and alveolar bone density, as well as acceleration of
alveolar bone repair. Similarly, "treating" alveolar bone loss includes mediating a level of
alveolar bone repair beyond (i.e., greater than) the level of alveolar bone repair experienced
in subjects (e.g., mammals, such as humans) not administered the sclerostin inhibitor (i.e.,
control subjects). Alveolar bone repair is evidenced by, for example, increased alveolar bone
height, increased alveolar bone volume, increased alveolar bone mineral content and density,
increased tooth stability or improved patient use of the affected area compared to such
parameters prior to treatment. The increase in any one or more parameters of alveolar bone
can be a return, in whole or in part, of the measured parameter to, e.g., (a) baseline level (e.g.,
the level prior to onset of disease), (b) values provided in normative databases or clinical
standards used in the art, or (c) the contralateral functional level (e.g., return, in whole or in
part, to the functional capabilities of, for example, non-diseased alveolar bone in the subject).
In some cases, the increase can be an improvement beyond baseline level. If desired, the
measured parameters in subjects administered one or more doses of the sclerostin inhibitor
can be compared to the same parameters in other subjects presenting with alveolar bone loss
(optionally age and gender matched) not administered the sclerostin inhibitor to further
analyze the efficacy of the methods described herein.
[0048]     Alveolar bone parameters (e.g., alveolar bone height, alveolar bone mass and/or
alveolar bone density) may be measured using radiography (e.g., radiographic
absorptometry), single- and/or dual-energy X-ray absorptometry, quantitative computed
tomography (QCT), ultrasonography, radiography (e.g., radiographic absorptometry), and
magnetic resonance imaging. In some embodiments, the amount of alveolar bone loss is
identified and/or quantified by the periodontal pocket probing depth measurement.
[0049]     In some embodiments, the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or
antibody fragment) is administered at a dose and for a time period effective to decrease the

distance between the cement-enamel junction and the alveolar bone crest by at least 10%
(e.g., at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least
70%, at least 80%, at least 90% or more) compared to the pre-treatment distance or a control
subject (i.e., a subject with similar disease state that did not receive treatment with the
sclerostin inhibitor) by six weeks after initiation of treatment. In some embodiments, the
distance between the cement-enamel junction and the alveolar bone crest is restored to the
pre-disease state by six weeks after initiation of treatment. In some embodiments, the
distance between the cement-enamel junction and the alveolar bone crest is less than or equal
to about 2 mm (e.g., about 2 mm, about 1.9 mm, about 1.8 mm, about 1.7 mm, about 1.6 mm,
about 1.5 mm, about 1.4 mm, about 1.3 mm, about 1.2 mm, about 1.1 mm or about 1 mm) by
six weeks after initiation of treatment. In some or any embodiments, the distance between
the cement-enamel junction and the alveolar bone crest is comparable to the distance in a
non-diseased area of the subject's mouth (e.g., an adjacent or contralateral tooth) by six
weeks after initiation of treatment.
[0050]      In some embodiments, the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or
antibody fragment) is administered at a dose and for a time period effective to increase the
alveolar bone height by at least 10% (e.g., at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least
40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% or more) compared
to the pre-treatment alveolar bone height or a control subject (i.e., a subject with advanced
periodontal disease that did not receive treatment with the sclerostin inhibitor) by six weeks
after initiation of treatment. In some embodiments, the alveolar bone height is restored to
pre-disease state alveolar bone height by six weeks after initiation of treatment. In some
embodiments, the alveolar bone height is increased by at least 0.1 mm (e.g., at least about 0.1
mm, about 0.2 mm, about 0.3 mm, about 0.4 mm, about 0.5 mm, about 0.6 mm, about 0.7
mm, about 0.8 mm, about 0.9 mm, about 1 mm, about 1.5 mm, about 2 mm, about 2.5 mm,
about 3 mm, about 3.5 mm, about 4 mm, about 4.5 mm, about 5 mm, about 5.5 mm, about 6
mm, about 6.5 mm, about 7 mm, about 7.5 mm, about 8 mm, about 8.5 mm, about 9 mm,
about 9.5 about 10 mm) or more compared to pre-treatment alveolar bone height by six
weeks after initiation of treatment. In some or any embodiments, the alveolar bone height is
comparable to the distance in a non-diseased area of the subject's mouth (e.g., an adjacent or
contralateral tooth) by six weeks after initiation of treatment.
[0051]      In some embodiments, the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or
antibody fragment) is administered at a dose and for a time period effective to increase the
alveolar bone density by at least 10% (e.g., at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least
                                                  I A

    WO 2013/101451                                                           PCT/US2012/068975
40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% or more) compared
to the pre-treatment alveolar bone density or a control subject (i.e., a subject with advanced
periodontal disease that did not receive treatment with the sclerostin inhibitor) by six weeks
after initiation of treatment. In some embodiments, the alveolar bone density is restored to
pre-disease state alveolar bone density (e.g., of comparable density to a non-diseased gingival
area of the subject's mouth) by six weeks after initiation of treatment. In humans, bone
mineral density often is determined clinically using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Other
techniques include quantitative computed tomography (QCT), ultrasonography, single-energy
x-ray absorptiometry (SXA), magnetic resonance imaging, radiography, and radiographic
absorptiometry. Except for ultrasonography, the American Medical Association notes that
BMD techniques typically involve the use of x-rays and are based on the principle that
attenuation of the radiation depends on thickness and composition of the tissues in the
radiation path. Often, techniques involve the comparison of results to a normative database.
[0052]      Another parameter useful to assess successful treatment with a sclerostin inhibitor
is alveolar bone volume fraction (BVF). The term "bone volume fraction" as used herein
refers to the volume of mineralized bone per unit volume of the bone sample (BV/TV, %)
and can be measured, for example, by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). In some or
any embodiments, the alveolar BVF is increased by at least 10% (e.g., at least 10%, at least
20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least
90% or more) compared to the pre-treatment alveolar BVF or compared to a control subject
(i.e., a subject with advanced periodontal disease that did not receive treatment with the
sclerostin inhibitor) by six weeks after initiation of treatment. In some or any embodiments,
the alveolar BVF is comparable to the alveolar BVF in a non-diseased area of the subject's
mouth (e.g., an adjacent or contralateral tooth) by six weeks after initiation of treatment.
[0053]      The increase in any one or more of alveolar bone height, alveolar bone mass,
alveolar bone density, and alveolar bone volume fraction and/or the decrease in the distance
between the cement-enamel junction and the bone crest (or improvement of any other
alveolar bone parameter) can be determined at 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks,
6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 9 weeks, 10 weeks or more following the initial administration
of sclerostin inhibitor. Alternatively, the increase in any one or more of alveolar bone height,
alveolar bone mass, alveolar bone volume fraction and alveolar bone density (and/or the
decrease in the distance between the cement-enamel junction and the bone crest) can be
determined after the treatment period ends (e.g., 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks,
6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 9 weeks, 10 weeks, 11 weeks, 12 weeks, 13 weeks, 14 weeks, 15

    WO 2013/101451                                                            PCT/US2012/068975
weeks, 16 weeks, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8, months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months
or 1 year after the treatment period ends). In one aspect, the method reduces the amount of
time required to establish a desired level of alveolar bone height, alveolar bone mass, alveolar
bone density and/or alveolar bone volume fraction and/or the decrease in the distance
between the cement-enamel junction and the bone crest, e.g., any percent increase in alveolar
bone height, alveolar bone mass or alveolar bone density and/or alveolar bone volume
fraction, and/or distance between the cement-enamel junction and the bone crest described
herein compared to age and gender-matched patients that do not receive the sclerostin
inhibitor, thereby reducing recovery time for a subject. For example, in one embodiment, the
sclerostin inhibitor reduces the amount of time required to increase alveolar bone height,
alveolar bone mass, alveolar bone density and/or alveolar bone volume fraction and/or the
decrease in the distance between the cement-enamel junction and the bone crest at least about
10% (e.g., at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at
least about 40%, at least about 45%, or at least about 50%) compared to subject not receiving
the sclerostin inhibitor.
[0054]     Functional, quality of life parameters indicative of enhanced alveolar bone include,
but are not limited to, decreased risk of tooth loss; decreased bleeding of the gums, reduced
depth of the periodontal pocket, increased level of gingival tissue attachment, improved
pronunciation; improved sense of taste; increased ability to eat certain foods; decreased
tension; improved diet and decreased irritability. Administration of one or more doses of a
sclerostin inhibitor, as described herein, accelerates improvement of functional, quality of life
parameters associated with alveolar bone loss in a statistically significant manner in the
patient population tested.
[0055]     In some embodiments, one or more doses of a sclerostin inhibitor, such as a
sclerostin binding agent (e.g., an anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody fragment) is
administered to a human over the course of a treatment period comprising 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31 weeks, 8
months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, 1 year, 18 months or longer. A "treatment period"
begins upon administration of a first dose of sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody
or antibody fragment) and ends upon administration of a final dose of sclerostin inhibitor.
Any number of administrations of sclerostin inhibitor during a treatment period is
contemplated. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
doses or administrations of the sclerostin inhibitor is provided to the subject over the
treatment period. In one embodiment, the treatment period comprises at least 6 weeks. In

no more than 28 weeks, or no more than 20 weeks. In one embodiment, the treatment period
is about 28 weeks and yields significant improvement in alveolar bone parameters, such as
(but not limited to) alveolar bone height, alveolar bone mass, alveolar bone volume fraction
and alveolar bone density compared to untreated subjects with alveolar bone loss.
[0056]     The sclerostin binding agent (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody fragment) is
administered in an amount that promotes, enhances, or accelerates repair of the alveolar bone.
In any embodiment, the sclerostin inhibitor may be administered to a subject (e.g., a human
subject) in an amount from about 5 milligrams to about 1,000 milligrams of sclerostin
inhibitor per week. For example, the amount of sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin
antibody or antibody fragment) can comprise at least about 5 mg, 15 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg,
about 60 mg, about 70 mg, about 80 mg, about 90 mg, about 100 mg, about 120 mg, about
140 mg, about 150 mg, about 170 mg, about 180 mg, about 200 mg, about 210 mg, about 240

about 420 mg, about 450 mg, about 500 mg, about 550 mg, about 600 mg, about 650 mg,
about 700 mg, about 750 mg, about 800 mg, about 850 mg, about 900 mg, about 950 mg or
up to about 1,000 mg of sclerostin inhibitor. Ranges between any and all of these endpoints
are also contemplated, e.g. about 50 mg to about 80 mg, about 70 mg to about 140 mg, about
70 mg to about 210 mg, about 75 mg to about 100 mg, about 100 mg to about 150 mg, about
120 mg to about 270 mg, about 140 mg to about 210 mg, or about 150 mg to about 200 mg,
or about 280 to about 410 mg. A dose is administered at any interval, such as multiple times
a week (e.g., twice or three times per week), once a week, once every two weeks, once every
three weeks, or once every four weeks. In some or any embodiments, a dose of sclerostin
inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody fragment) ranging from about 120 mg to
about 210 mg is administered twice a week. In some or any embodiments, a dose of about
140 mg of the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody fragment) is
administered twice a week. In some or any embodiments, the treatment period is 12 weeks
and the sclerostin is administered on week 2, week 6 and week 12 of the treatment period,
optionally at a dose of about 140 mg. Any of the doses described herein may be administered
as divided doses. For example, a dose of 140 mg of sclerostin inhibitor may be administered

inhibitor during a dentist visit.
[0057]     In some embodiments, the dose of sclerostin binding agent administered to a
subject (e.g., a mammal, such as a human) may range from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 100
mg/kg, or about 10 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg of body weight. For example, the dose of
sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., sclerostin binding agent) may range from about 0.1 mg/kg, about 0.5
mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg, about 2 mg/kg , about 3 mg/kg, about 4 mg/kg about 5 mg/kg, about 6

[0058]     In addition, it may be advantageous to administer multiple doses of a sclerostin
binding agent or space out the administration of doses, depending on the therapeutic regimen
selected for a particular patient. For example, a dose of sclerostin inhibitor can be
administered once every four weeks, once every three weeks, once every two weeks, once a
week, or multiple times a week (e.g., twice a week, three times a week, four times a week, or
more), depending on the severity of the disease state, the age and physical health of the
patient, and the like.

neuroma, oligodendroglioma, and menangioma. The terms "metastasis" and "cancer
metastasis" are used interchangeably herein to refer to the ability of a cancer cell to spread to
other tissues. For example, "metastasis to bone" refers to the ability of certain types of cancer
including, but not limited to, breast, prostate, lung, kidney, thyroid, and melanoma, to
metastasize to bone.
[0062]     The methods described herein are also applicable to other forms of periodontal
disease including periodontal disease associated with systemic disorders such as
cardiovascular disease, stroke, pulmonary disease, inflammatory diseases and systemic lupus
erythematosus; periodontal disease associated with metabolic disorders such as diabetes
mellitus, and periodontal disease associated with hormonal alterations associated with, for
example, menopause. Use of certain drugs such as anticonvulsants, calcium channel
blockers, and cyclosporine, may also elevate the risk of gingival hyperplasia or periodontal
disease, as does certain hematologic disorders including immune system disorders caused by,
for example, HIV. The treatment of subjects suffering from or at risk of suffering from the
aforementioned disorders with a sclerostin inhibitor described herein is specifically
contemplated.
[0063]     In some embodiments, the subject optionally suffers from an osteolytic disorder.
The term "osteolytic disorder" as used herein refers to any condition that is caused by an

increase in the activity of osteoclasts, which are cells responsible for bone resorption. The
terms "osteolysis" and "osteolytic bone loss" are used interchangeably to refer to osteoclast
mediated bone resorption or bone loss associated with an osteolytic disorder. Osteolytic
disorders occur in subjects with a predisposition to develop an osteolytic disorder, or they
occur in subjects with a disease that leads to or contributes to an osteolytic disorder by
stimulating osteoclast activity. In some embodiments, the osteolytic disorder is osteolytic
bone loss. In other embodiments, the osteolytic disorder is cancer metastasis-induced
osteolytic bone loss. In further embodiments, the osteolytic bone disorder is a metabolic
bone disease, including but not limited to, endocrinopathies (e.g., hypercortisolism,
hypogonadism, primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, and hyperthyroidism); dietary
deficiency, including but not limited to, rickets, osteomalacia, scurvy, and malnutrition;
osteoporosis; drug use, including glucocorticoids (glucocorticoid-induced osteoperosis),
heparin, and alcohol; chronic disease, including malabsorption syndromes; chronic renal
failure, including renal osteodystrophy; chronic liver disease, including hepatic
osteodystrophy; inherited disease, including osteogenesis imperfecta and homocystinuria; and
bone inflammation associated with arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, fibrous
dysplasia, periodontal disease, and Paget's disease.
[0064]     The terms "metastasis-induced osteolytic bone loss," and "cancer metastasis
induced osteolytic bone loss," are used interchangeably herein to refer to osteolysis or
osteolytic bone loss resulting from cancer cell metastasis to bone. The term "cancer
metastasis-induced osteoclast activation" is used herein to refer to the ability of cancer cells
that have metastasized to bone to induce the activation of osteoclasts.
[0065]     The methods described herein comprise administering an amount of a "sclerostin
inhibitor." As used herein, the term "sclerostin inhibitor" means any molecule that inhibits
the biological activity of sclerostin on bone, as measured by changes to bone mineralization,
bone density, bone height, effect on osteoblasts and/or osteoclasts, markers of bone
formation, markers of bone resorption, markers of osteoblast activity, and/or markers of
osteoclast activity. Such inhibitors may act by binding to sclerostin or its receptor or binding
partner. Inhibitors in this category include "sclerostin binding agents," such as, e.g.,
antibodies or peptide-based molecules. "Sclerostin inhibitors" also refers to small organic
chemical compounds, optionally of less than about 1000 Daltons in molecular weight that
bind sclerostin and inhibit its activity. Inhibitors may alternatively act by inhibiting
expression of sclerostin. Inhibitors in this category include polynucleotides or
oligonucleotides that bind to sclerostin DNA or mRNA and inhibit sclerostin expression,

    WO 2013/101451                                                            PCT/US2012/068975
including, but not limited to, an antisense oligonucleotide, inhibitory RNA, DNA enzyme
(deoxyribozyme), ribozyme, an aptamer or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof that
inhibit the expression of sclerostin.
[0066]       A "sclerostin binding agent" binds to sclerostin or portions thereof to block or
impair binding of human sclerostin to one or more ligands. Sclerostin, the product of the
SOST gene, is absent in sclerosteosis, a skeletal disease characterized by bone overgrowth
and strong dense bones (Brunkow et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet., 68:577-589 (2001); Balemans
et al., Hum. Mol. Genet., 10:537-543 (2001)). The amino acid sequence of human sclerostin
is reported by Brunkow et al. and is disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20070110747 as
SEQ ID NO: 1 (which patent publication is incorporated in its entirety for its description of
sclerostin binding agents and Sequence Listing). Recombinant human sclerostin/SOST is
commercially available from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn., USA; 2006 Catalog #1406
ST-025). Additionally, recombinant mouse sclerostin/SOST is commercially available from
R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn., USA; 2006 Catalog #1589-ST-025).              Research grade
sclerostin-binding monoclonal antibodies are commercially available from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, Minn., USA; mouse monoclonal: 2006 Catalog # MAB 1406; rat monoclonal:
2006 Catalog # MAB1589). U.S. Patent Nos. 6,395,511 and 6,803,453, and U.S. Patent
Publication Nos. 20040009535 and 20050106683 refer to anti-sclerostin antibodies generally.
Examples of sclerostin binding agents suitable for use in the context of the invention also are
described in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20070110747 and 20070072797, which are hereby
incorporated by reference. Additional information regarding materials and methods for
generating sclerostin binding agents can be found in U.S. Patent Publication No.
20040158045 (hereby incorporated by reference).
[0067]       The sclerostin binding agent of the invention preferably is an antibody. The term
"antibody" refers to an intact antibody, or a binding fragment thereof. An antibody may
comprise a complete antibody (immunoglobulin) molecule (including polyclonal,
monoclonal, chimeric, humanized, and/or human versions having full length heavy and/or
light chains), or comprise an antigen binding fragment thereof. Antibody fragments include
F(ab') 2 , Fab, Fab', Fv, Fc, and Fd fragments, and can be incorporated into single domain
antibodies (e.g., nanobodies), single-chain antibodies, maxibodies, minibodies, intrabodies,
diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, v-NAR and bis-scFv (see, e.g., Hollinger and Hudson,
Nature Biotechnology, 23(9):1126-1136 (2005)). Antibody polypeptides, including
fibronectin polypeptide monobodies, also are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,703,199. Other
antibody polypeptides are disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050238646. U.S.

Patent Nos. 6,395,511 and 6,803,453, and U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20040009535 and
20050106683 (incorporated in their entirety by reference for their disclosure of anti-sclerostin
antibodies) refer to anti-sclerostin antibodies generally. The amino acid sequence of human
sclerostin is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 of the Sequence Listing and is provided as SEQ ID
NO: 1 of U.S. Patent Publication No. 20070110747 (which patent publication is incorporated
in its entirety for its description of sclerostin and sclerostin binding agents and Sequence
Listing). Additional information regarding materials and methods for generating anti
sclerostin antibodies can be found in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040158045 (hereby
incorporated by reference in its entirety).
[0068]      An antibody fragment may be a synthetic or genetically engineered protein. For
example, antibody fragments include isolated fragments consisting of the light chain variable
region, "Fv" fragments consisting of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains, and
recombinant single chain polypeptide molecules in which light and heavy variable regions are
connected by a peptide linker (scFv proteins).
[0069]      Another form of an antibody fragment is a peptide comprising one or more
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of an antibody. CDRs (also termed "minimal
recognition units" or "hypervariable region") are obtained by, e.g., constructing
polynucleotides that encode the CDR of interest. Such polynucleotides are prepared, for
example, by using the polymerase chain reaction to synthesize the variable region using
mRNA of antibody-producing cells as a template (see, for example, Larrick et al., Methods: A
Companion to Methods in Enzymology, 2:106 (1991); Courtenay-Luck, "Genetic
Manipulation of Monoclonal Antibodies," in Monoclonal Antibodies Production,
Engineeringand ClinicalApplication, Ritter et al. (eds.), page 166, Cambridge University
Press (1995); and Ward et al., "Genetic Manipulation and Expression of Antibodies," in
MonoclonalAntibodies: Principles and Applications, Birch et al., (eds.), page 137, Wiley
Liss, Inc. (1995)).
[0070]      Anti-sclerostin antibodies may bind to sclerostin of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a naturally
occurring variant thereof, with an affinity (Kd) of less than or equal to 1 x 10-7 M, less than or
equal to 1 x 10-8 M, less than or equal to 1 x 10-9 M, less than or equal to 1 x 10-10 M, less than
or equal to 1 x 10-11 M, or less than or equal to 1 x 10- 12 M. Affinity is determined using a
variety of techniques, an example of which is an affinity ELISA assay. In various
embodiments, affinity is determined by a BlAcore assay. In various embodiments, affinity is
determined by a kinetic method. In various embodiments, affinity is determined by an
equilibrium/solution method. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20070110747 contains additional

[0071]      In some or any embodiments, the anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody fragment
binds to a sclerostin polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID
NO: 1 and binds the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 (CGPARLLPNAIGRGKWWRPSGPDFRC;
corresponding to amino acids 86-111 of SEQ ID NO: 1). Alternatively or in addition, the
anti-sclerostin antibody binds to a sclerostin polypeptide comprising amino acids 57-146 of
SEQ ID NO: 1. Alternatively or in addition, the anti-sclerostin antibody binds to a sclerostin
polypeptide comprising amino acids 89-103 of SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or amino acids 137-151 of
SEQ ID NO: 1. Alternatively or in addition, the anti-sclerostin antibody binds to a sclerostin

sclerostin of SEQ ID NO: 1 comprising SEQ ID NOs: 2-5 (and/or SEQ ID NOs: 70-73),
optionally in its native three-dimensional conformation. Optionally, the anti-sclerostin
antibody binds a peptide consisting of one or more of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ

[0079]      Anti-sclerostin antibodies for use in the methods described herein preferably
modulate sclerostin function in the cell-based assay described in U.S. Patent Publication No.
2007/0110747 and/or the in vivo assay described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20070110747
and/or bind to one or more of the epitopes described in U.S. Patent Publication No.
2007/0110747 and/or cross-block the binding of one of the antibodies described in U.S.
Patent Publication No. 2007/0110747 and/or are cross-blocked from binding sclerostin by
one of the antibodies described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007/0110747 (incorporated
by reference in its entirety and for its description of assays for characterizing an anti
sclerostin antibody).
[0080]      In various aspects, the anti-sclerostin antibody is capable of neutralizing human
sclerostin in a MC3T3 cell-based mineralization assay when there is less than a 6-fold excess
of moles of sclerostin binding sites per well as compared to the number of moles of sclerostin
per well. Mineralization by osteoblast-lineage cells in culture, either primary cells or cell
lines, is used as an in vitro model of bone formation. An exemplary cell-based mineralization
assay is described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20070110747 at, e.g., Example 8 (hereby
incorporated by reference). MC3T3-El cells (Sudo et al., J. Cell Biol., 96:191-198 (1983))
and subclones of the original cell line can form mineral in culture upon growth in the
presence of differentiating agents. Such subclones include MC3T3-El-BF (Smith et al., J.
Biol. Chem., 275:19992-20001 (2000)). For both the MC3T3-El-BF subclone as well as the
original MC3T3-El cells, sclerostin can inhibit one or more of the sequence of events leading
up to and including mineral deposition (i.e., sclerostin inhibits mineralization). Anti
sclerostin antibodies that are able to neutralize sclerostin's inhibitory activity allow for
mineralization of the culture in the presence of sclerostin such that there is a statistically
significant increase in, e.g., deposition of calcium phosphate (measured as calcium) as

    WO 2013/101451                                                            PCT/US2012/068975
compared to the amount of calcium measured in the sclerostin-only (i.e., no antibody)
treatment group.
[0081]      When running the assay with the goal of determining whether a particular anti
sclerostin antibody (or other sclerostin inhibitor) can neutralize sclerostin, the amount of
sclerostin used in the assay desirably is the minimum amount of sclerostin that causes at least
a 70%, statistically significant, reduction in deposition of calcium phosphate (measured as
calcium) in the sclerostin-only group, as compared to the amount of calcium measured in the
no sclerostin group. An anti-sclerostin neutralizing antibody is defined as one that causes a
statistically significant increase in deposition of calcium phosphate (measured as calcium) as
compared to the amount of calcium measured in the sclerostin-only (i.e., no antibody)
treatment group. To determine whether an anti-sclerostin antibody is neutralizing or not, the
amount of anti-sclerostin antibody used in the assay needs to be such that there is an excess
of moles of sclerostin binding sites per well as compared to the number of moles of sclerostin
per well. Depending on the potency of the antibody, the fold excess that may be required can
be 24, 18, 12, 6, 3, or 1.5, and one of skill is familiar with the routine practice of testing more
than one concentration of binding agent (antibody). For example, a very potent anti
sclerostin neutralizing antibody will neutralize sclerostin when there is less than a 6-fold
excess of moles of sclerostin binding sites per well as compared to the number of moles of
sclerostin per well. A less potent anti-sclerostin neutralizing antibody will neutralize
sclerostin only at a 12, 18 or 24 fold excess.
[0082]      The anti-sclerostin antibody optionally has an IC50 of 100 nM or less, or 75 nM or
less, or 50 nM or less, or 25 nM or less for neutralizing human sclerostin in a cell-based
assay, such as a bone specific alkaline phosphatase assay, e.g., the bone specific alkaline
phosphatase assay described in International Patent Publication No. WO 2008/115732 and
U.S. Patent No. 7,744,874 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for its description
of cell-based assays and anti-sclerostin antibodies). The bone specific alkaline phosphatase
assay is predicated on the ability of sclerostin to decrease BMP-4 and Wnt3a-stimulated
alkaline phosphatase levels in the multipotential murine cell line, C2C12. According to WO
2008/115732, a neutralizing anti-sclerostin antibody mediates a dose-dependent increase of
alkaline phosphatase activity in this assay. Exemplary protocols of the cell-based assays are
provided in Example 1.
[0083]      Alternatively or in addition, the anti-sclerostin antibody has an IC50 of 100 nM or
less (e.g., 75 nM or less, or 50 nM or less) for neutralizing human sclerostin in a cell-based
Wnt signaling assay in HEK293 cell lines, such as the Wnt assay involving Wntl-mediated

    WO 2013/101451                                                          PCT/US2012/068975
induction of STF reporter gene described in e.g., International Patent Publication No. WO
2009/047356 (incorporated by reference for its discussion of anti-sclerostin antibodies and
cell-based assays). Alternatively or in addition, the anti-sclerostin antibody has an IC50 of
500 nM or less (e.g., 250 nM or less, 150 nM or less, 100 nM or less, or 50 nM or less) for
neutralizing human sclerostin in a BMP2-induced mineralization assay in MC3T3 cells, such
as the mineralization assay described in e.g., International Patent Publication No. WO
2009/047356. An exemplary protocol is provided in Example 1.
[0084]     Examples of anti-sclerostin antibodies suitable for use in the context of the
invention are described in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2007/0110747 and 2007/0072797,
which are hereby incorporated by reference. In one embodiment of the invention, the anti
sclerostin antibody cross-blocks the binding of at least one of antibodies Ab-A, Ab-B, Ab-C,
Ab-D, Ab-1, Ab-2, Ab-3, Ab-4, Ab-5, Ab-6, Ab-7, Ab-8, Ab-9, Ab-10, Ab-11, Ab-12, Ab

(all of which are described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20070110747) to sclerostin.
Alternatively or in addition, the anti-sclerostin antibody is cross-blocked from binding to
sclerostin by at least one of antibodies Ab-A, Ab-B, Ab-C, Ab-D, Ab-1, Ab-2, Ab-3, Ab-4,
Ab-5, Ab-6, Ab-7, Ab-8, Ab-9, Ab-10, Ab-11, Ab-12, Ab-13, Ab-14, Ab-15, Ab-16, Ab-17,
Ab-18, Ab-19, Ab-20, Ab-21, Ab-22, Ab-23, and Ab-24 (all of which are described in U.S.
Patent Publication No. 20070110747). The terms "cross-block," "cross-blocked," and "cross
blocking" are used interchangeably herein to mean the ability of an antibody to interfere with
the binding of other antibodies to sclerostin. The extent to which an antibody is able to
interfere with the binding of another to sclerostin, and therefore whether it can be said to
cross-block, can be determined using competition binding assays. In some aspects of the
invention, a cross-blocking antibody or fragment thereof reduces sclerostin binding of a
reference antibody between about 40% and about 100%, such as about 60% and about 100%,
specifically between 70% and 100%, and more specifically between 80% and 100%. A
particularly suitable quantitative assay for detecting cross-blocking uses a Biacore machine
which measures the extent of interactions using surface plasmon resonance technology.
Another suitable quantitative cross-blocking assay uses an ELISA-based approach to measure
competition between antibodies in terms of their binding to sclerostin.
[0085]     In some or any embodiments, the anti-sclerostin antibody cross-blocks the binding
of an immunoglobulin comprising full length heavy and light chains to sclerostin of SEQ ID

chain comprising CDR's Li, L2, and L3 and comprising a polypeptide having the sequence
provided in SEQ ID NO: 334 or 341 or a variant of any of the foregoing in which the CDRs
are at least 75% identical (e.g., 100% identical) to SEQ ID NO: 239, 240, and 241,
respectively (as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20070110747). All combinations of
the heavy and light chain sequences are contemplated (e.g., heavy chains comprising SEQ ID
NO: 335 and light chains comprising SEQ ID NO: 334; heavy chains comprising SEQ ID
NO: 331 and light chains comprising SEQ ID NO: 334 or 341; and heavy chains comprising
SEQ ID NO: 345 or 396 and light chains comprising SEQ ID NO: 341).
[0093]     Alternatively, the anti-sclerostin antibody has a heavy chain comprising a
polypeptide having the sequence provided in SEQ ID NO: 137, and a light chain comprising a
polypeptide having the sequence provided in SEQ ID NO: 133; a heavy chain comprising a
polypeptide having the sequence provided in SEQ ID NO: 145 or 392, and a light chain
comprising a polypeptide having the sequence provided in SEQ ID NO: 141; a heavy chain
comprising a polypeptide having the sequence provided in SEQ ID NO:335, and a light chain
comprising a polypeptide having the sequence provided in SEQ ID NO:334; a heavy chain
comprising a polypeptide having the sequence provided in SEQ ID NO:33 1, and a light chain
comprising a polypeptide having the sequence provided in SEQ ID NO:341; or a heavy chain
comprising a polypeptide having the sequence provided in SEQ ID NO:345 or 396, and a
light chain comprising a polypeptide having the sequence provided in SEQ ID NO:341 (as
described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20070110747).
[0094]     Examples of anti-sclerostin antibodies also include, but are not limited to, the anti
sclerostin antibodies disclosed in International Patent Publication Nos. WO 2008/092894,

reference herein in its entirety), such as an anti-sclerostin antibody comprising CDRs of SEQ
ID NOs: 20-25 of International Patent Publication No. WO 2008/115732 (SEQ ID NOs: 416
421 herein), an anti-sclerostin antibody comprising CDRs of SEQ ID NOs: 26-31 of

   WO 2013/101451                                                            PCT/US2012/068975
antibody comprising CDRs of SEQ ID NOs: 4, 15, 26, 37, 48, and 59 of International Patent
Publication No. WO 2009/047356 (SEQ ID NOs: 443, 454, 465, 476, 487 and 498,
respectively, herein), or an anti-sclerostin antibody comprising the amino acid sequence of at
least one of SEQ ID NOs: 135-143, 153-161, or 171-179 of International Patent Publication
No. WO 2010/130830 (SEQ ID NOs: 745-753, 763-771, 781-789, respectively, herein).
[0095]      Alternatively, the methods described herein comprise administering a sclerostin
inhibitor other than an anti-sclerostin antibody. Such agents can act directly or indirectly on
SOST or sclerostin. Sclerostin inhibitors contemplated for use in the methods described
herein include those described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0229041 (the entire
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, with particular emphasis upon the
description of sclerostin inhibitors). For example, agents useful for modulating SOST
expression and sclerostin activity include, but are not limited to, steroids (such as those
corresponding to Formula 1 of U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0229041), alkaloids,
terpenoids, peptoids, and synthetic chemicals. In some embodiments, the SOST antagonist or
agonist can bind to a glucocorticoid receptor. For example, dexamethasone tends to abolish
the stimulatory effect of BMP-4 and BMP-6 on SOST expression. Other chemical entities
including glucocorticoid analogs, bile salts (such as those corresponding to Formula 3 of U.S.
Patent Publication No. 2003/0229041), and prostaglandins (such as those corresponding to
Formula 2 of U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0229041) also modulate the effects of bone
morphogenetic proteins on SOST expression, and are contemplated for use in the methods
described herein.
[0096]      Sclerostin expression inhibitors that may be used according to the methods
described herein include, but are not limited to, inhibitory nucleic acids, including
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, e.g., sodium salts. In some embodiments, the
inhibitory nucleic acid as described elsewhere herein is selected from the group consisting of
antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides,
siRNA compounds, single- or double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) compounds such as
siRNA compounds, modified bases/locked nucleic acids (LNAs), antagomirs, peptide nucleic
acids (PNAs), and other oligomeric compounds or oligonucleotide mimetics which hybridize
to at least a portion of the target nucleic acid and modulate its function. In some
embodiments, the inhibitor nucleic acid is single stranded or double stranded. In some
embodiments, the inhibitory nucleic acid is an antisense oligonucleotide, modified
bases/locked nucleic acids (LNA), peptide nucleic acids (PNA), arabinonucleic acids (ANA)
(as described, for example, in PCT Publication No. WO 99/67378); 2'-fluoro-D-

    WO 2013/101451                                                              PCT/US2012/068975
Arabinonucleic acids (FANA) (as described in, for example, Lon et al., Biochem., 41:3457
3467, 2002 and Min et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 12:2651-2654, 2002; the disclosures of
which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties); phosphorodiamidate
morpholino oligomers (PMO) (e.g., as described in Iverson, Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther., 3:235
238, 2001; and Wang et al., J. Gene Med., 12:354-364, 2010; the disclosures of which are
incorporated herein by reference in their entireties); ethylene bridged nucleic acids (as
described in, for example, International Patent Publication No. WO 2005/042777, Morita et
al., Nucleic Acid Res., Suppl 1:241-242, 2001; Surono et al., Hum. Gene Ther., 15:749-757,
2004; Koizumi, Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther., 8:144-149, 2006 and Horie et al., Nucleic Acids
Symp. Ser (Oxf), 49:171-172, 2005; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by
reference in their entireties); 2'-O,4'-C-ethylene-bridged nucleic acid, ribozyme, external
guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides, microRNAs (miRNAs), small, temporal RNAs
(stRNAs), and single- or double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) compounds or siRNA.
In some embodiments, the inhibitory nucleic acid comprises at least one nucleotide and/or
nucleoside modification (e.g., oligonucleotides with modified backbones or modified sugar
moieties).
[0097]     Activity of a particular sclerostin inhibitor, e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody
fragment, for use in the methods described herein may be measured in a variety of ways,
including the methods described above for detecting increases in bone mineral content or
bone density. The ability of a sclerostin inhibitor to modulate bone mass may be calculated
from body weights or by using other methods (see Guinness-Hey, Metab. Bone Dis. Relat.
Res., 5:177-181 (1984)). Animals and particular animal models are used in the art for testing
the effect of the pharmaceutical compositions and methods on, for example, parameters of
bone loss, bone resorption, bone formation, bone strength, or bone mineralization. Examples
of such models include the ovariectomized rat model (Kalu, Bone and Mineral, 15:175-192
(1991); Frost and Jee, Bone and Mineral, 18:227-236 (1992); and Jee and Yao, J.
Musculoskel. Neuron. Interact., 1:193-207 (2001)). The methods for measuring sclerostin
binding agent activity described herein also may be used to determine the efficacy of other
sclerostin inhibitors.
[0098]     Alternatively, a sclerostin inhibitor can be selected based on its ability to modulate
bone marker levels. Bone markers are products created during the bone remodeling process
and are released by bone, osteoblasts, and/or osteoclasts. Fluctuations in bone resorption
and/or bone formation "marker" levels imply changes in bone remodeling/modeling. The
International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) recommends using bone markers to monitor

    WO 2013/101451                                                            PCT/US2012/068975
bone density therapies (see, e.g., Delmas et al., Osteoporos Int., Suppl. 6:S2-17 (2000),
incorporated herein by reference). Markers indicative of bone resorption (or osteoclast
activity) include, for example, C-telopeptide (e.g., C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen
(CTX) or serum cross-linked C-telopeptide), N-telopeptide (N-terminal telopeptide of type 1
collagen (NTX)), deoxypyridinoline (DPD), pyridinoline, urinary hydroxyproline, galactosyl
hydroxylysine, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (e.g., serum tartrate-resistant acid
phosphatase isoform 5b). Bone formation/mineralization markers include, but are not limited
to, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), peptides released from N- and C-terminal
extension of type I procollagen (P1NP, PICP), and osteocalcin (OstCa). Several kits are
commercially-available to detect and quantify markers in clinical samples, such as urine and
blood.
[0099]     Routes of Administration
[00100]     The sclerostin inhibitor is preferably administered to a subject in a
physiologically-acceptable (e.g., pharmaceutical) composition, which can include carriers,
excipients, or diluents. It will be appreciated that the sclerostin inhibitors (e.g., an anti
sclerostin antibody or antibody fragment) described herein may be used in the preparation of
a medicament for administration using any of the dosage and timing regimens disclosed
herein. Pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment are disclosed in U.S. Patent
Publication No. 20050106683 and 2007/110747, which are incorporated by reference herein.
"Physiologically-acceptable" refers to molecular entities and compositions that do not
produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction when administered to a human. In addition,
the composition administered to a subject may contain more than one sclerostin inhibitor
(e.g., two anti-sclerostin antibodies, or a sclerostin binding agent and a synthetic chemical
sclerostin inhibitor) or a sclerostin inhibitor in combination with one or more therapeutics
having different mechanisms of action.
[00101]     The development of compositions suitable for use in a variety of routes of
administration, including e.g., subcutaneous, oral, parenteral, intravenous, intranasal, and
intramuscular administration and formulation, is well known in the art and discussed in U.S.
Patent Publication No. 2007/0110747. For example, in certain circumstances, it will be
desirable to deliver a pharmaceutical composition comprising a sclerostin binding agent
subcutaneously, parenterally, intravenously, intramuscularly, or even intraperitoneally. Such
approaches are well known to the skilled artisan, some of which are further described, for
example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,543,158; 5,641,515; and 5,399,363. Illustrative
pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or

    WO 2013/101451                                                              PCT/US2012/068975
dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable
solutions or dispersions (for example, see U.S. Patent No. 5,466,468). In all cases the form
must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists (i.e., is not
excessively viscous so as to prevent passage through a syringe).
[00102]      In one aspect, the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody
fragment) is administered systemically. In one embodiment, for parenteral administration in
an aqueous solution, the solution should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid
diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous
solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and
intraperitoneal administration. For example, one dosage may be dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic
NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the
proposed site of infusion (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 15th ed.,
Mack Pub. Co., Easton, PA, pp. 1035-1038 and 1570-1580). Some variation in dosage and
frequency of administration may occur depending on the condition of the subject being
treated; age, height, weight, and overall health of the patient; and the existence of any side
effects. In addition, a pharmaceutical composition comprising a sclerostin binding agent may
be placed within containers (e.g. vials or pre-filled syringes), along with packaging material
that provides instructions regarding the use of such pharmaceutical compositions. Generally,
such instructions will include a tangible expression describing the reagent concentration, as
well as within certain embodiments, relative amounts of excipient ingredients or diluents
(e.g., water, saline or PBS) that may be necessary to reconstitute the pharmaceutical
composition.
[00103]      In another aspect, the sclerostin inhibitor is administered locally to the subject. In
some or any embodiments, the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody
fragment) is administered by disease to the diseased gingival, bone or tooth area. In this
regard, the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody fragment) is
optionally injected directly into the gingival tissue and/or applied to the periodontal pocket
by, for example, a syringe containing the sclerostin inhibitor and an appropriate carrier.
[00104]      For local administration aspects (such as subcutaneous injection of the sclerostin
inhibitor directly into the diseased gingival area or diseased periodontal pocket of the
subject), the sclerostin inhibitor is optionally administered to a subject in an amount of about
0.1 mg to about 20 mg. In some embodiments, the sclerostin inhibitor is administered
directly to the affected area in an amount of about 0.1 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, 4 mg, 5
mg, 6 mg, 7 mg, 8 mg, 9 mg, 10 mg, 11 mg, 12 mg, 13 mg, 14 mg, 15 mg, 16 mg, 17 mg, 18

    WO 2013/101451                                                           PCT/US2012/068975
mg, 19, or about 20 mg. The dose is administered at any interval, such as multiple times a
week (e.g., twice or three times per week), once a week, once every two weeks, once every
three weeks, or once every four weeks. In some or any embodiments, a dose of sclerostin
inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or antibody fragment) ranging from about 0.1 mg to
about 20 mg is administered twice a week. The amount of inhibitor is optionally
administered as a divided dose, e.g., using multiple injections along a segment of the affected
area.
[00105]     In some or any embodiments, the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody
or antibody fragment) is incorporated into a gel, mesh, matrix or collagen sponge, embedded
in a dental implant or bone graft, or coated on an implant. The implant may be a re
implantation of a subject's own tooth (e.g., lost through trauma) or a prosthetic implant
(made of, for example, plastic, ceramic, metal or from stem cells as described in WO
2004/074464).
[00106]     The term "mesh" means any material in any form including, for example, knotted,
braided, extruded, stamped, knitted, woven, non-woven or other form, and may include a
material with a substantially regular and/or irregular patterns. Examples of non-woven
meshes, including electrospun materials, may be used (for a review on the preparation
electrospun nanofiber material see Zheng-Ming Huang et al, Composites Science and
Technology, 2003, 63:2223-2253). A mesh can be, without limitation, a cross-linked fiber
mesh, a nanofiber mesh, a mesh fabric, biodegradable polymer mesh, or a combination of any
of the foregoing. A mesh can be non-degradable, degradable or biodegradable. A degradable
mesh can be a mesh that can be degraded via non-biological means (e.g., hydrolysis or
photolysis). A biodegradable mesh is, in various embodiments, a type of mesh that can be
broken down by a biological system through the action of cells or digestive enzymes or via
oxidation by biomolecules.
[00107]     Exemplary gel formulations for oral delivery of antibodies is described in WO
2010/1004179, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In some
embodiments, the gel is a hydrogel made of high molecular weight biocompatible elastomeric
polymers of synthetic or natural origin. A desirable property for hydrogels is the ability to
respond rapidly to mechanical stresses, particularly shears and loads, in the human body.
Hydrogels obtained from natural sources are contemplated because they are more likely to be
biodegradable and biocompatible for in vivo applications. Suitable hydrogels include natural
hydrogels, such as, for example, gelatin; collagen; silk; elastin; fibrin and polysaccharide
derived polymers; glucomannan gel; hyaluronic acid; polysaccharides, such as cross-linked

    WO 2013/101451                                                          PCT/US2012/068975
carboxyl-containing polysaccharides, or a combination thereof. Synthetic hydrogels include,
but are not limited to, those formed from polyvinyl alcohol; acrylamides such as polyacrylic
acid and poly(acrylonitrile-acrylic acid); polyurethanes; polyethylene glycol (e.g., PEG 3350,
PEG 4500, PEG 8000); silicone; polyolefins such as polyisobutylene and polyisoprene;
copolymers of silicone and polyurethane; neoprene; nitrile; vulcanized rubber; poly(N-vinyl
2-pyrrolidone); acrylates such as poly(2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate) and copolymers of
acrylates with N-vinyl pyrolidone; N-vinyl lactams; polyacrylonitrile or combinations
thereof. The hydrogel materials may further be cross-linked to provide further strength as
needed. Examples of different types of polyurethanes include thermoplastic or thermoset
polyurethanes, aliphatic or aromatic polyurethanes, polyetherurethane, polycarbonate
urethane or silicone polyether-urethane, or a combination thereof.
[00108]     In various embodiments, rather than directly admixing the sclerostin inhibitor into
the gel, microspheres being loaded with the sclerostin inhibitor may be dispersed within the
gel. In one embodiment, the microspheres provide for a sustained release of the sclerostin
inhibitor. In yet another embodiment, the gel, which is biodegradable, prevents the
microspheres from releasing the sclerostin inhibitor; the microspheres thus do not release the
sclerostin inhibitor until they have been released from the gel. For example, a gel may be
deployed around a target tissue site (e.g., alveolar ridge).
[00109]     The invention also contemplates the use of adherent gels to constrain dispersal of
the sclerostin inhibitor. The gels may be deployed, for example, in the periodontal pocket,
tooth, alveolar bone or in surrounding gingival tissue.
[00110]     In some or any embodiments, the sclerostin inhibitor is formulated into pastes,
balms, waxes, lotions, rinsing solutions, dried powers with/without bulking agent and various
other formats for topical administration known in the art. The sclerostin inhibitor may also
be delivered locally in the form of a powder or solution sprayed, or gargling solutions.
Alternatively, the sclerostin inhibitor is incorporated into wound dressings, pads, gauze, or
other means applied to the diseased area of interest (e.g., diseased gingival area or
periodontal pocket) from which they are transferred to the area of interest.
[00111]     Combination Therapy
[00112]     Treatment of a pathology by combining two or more agents that target the same
pathogen or biochemical pathway sometimes results in greater efficacy and diminished side
effects relative to the use of the therapeutically relevant dose of each agent alone. In some
cases, the efficacy of the drug combination is additive (the efficacy of the combination is

    WO 2013/101451                                                            PCT/US2012/068975
approximately equal to the sum of the effects of each drug alone), but in other cases the effect
can be synergistic (the efficacy of the combination is greater than the sum of the effects of
each drug given alone). As used herein, the term "combination therapy" means the two
compounds can be delivered in a simultaneous manner, e.g., concurrently, or wherein one of
the compounds is administered first, followed by the second agent, e.g., sequentially. The
desired result can be either a subjective relief of one or more symptoms or an objectively
identifiable improvement in the recipient of the dosage.
 [00113]     In some embodiments, the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g. anti-sclerostin antibody or
 antibody fragment) is administered in combination with the use of materials that support the
 regrowth of bone such as bone graft, bone dust, bone chips, demineralized bone matrix, bone
 scaffolds, prosthesis, metal stabilizers, or bone scaffold substances comprising one or more
 of polymers, ceramics, cement and calcium phosphates-based bone-graft substitutes. Many
 variations of such materials are known in the art.
[00114]     In some or any embodiments, a method or use described herein comprises
administering a standard of care therapy for the treatment of the periodontal disease to the
subject prior to administering the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or
antibody fragment). For example, in some embodiments, the standard of care therapy for the
treatment of periodontal disease is a therapeutic selected from the group consisting of
Periostat@ and chemically modified tetracycline-3 (CMT-3). In some embodiments, the
standard of care therapy comprises oral irrigation and/or scaling and supra- and/or sub
gingival debridement (e.g., removal of microbial plaque and calculus) of the affected area of
the subject. In some embodiments, the standard of care comprises performing oral irrigation
and/or scaling and debridement of the affected area in combination with Periostat and/or
CMT-3 prior to administration of the sclerostin inhibitor. In some embodiments, the method
comprises administering the standard of care therapy concurrently with the administration of
the sclerostin inhibitor. In other embodiments, the standard of care therapy is administered
sequentially. For example, the standard of care therapy can be administered 1 day, 2 days, 3
days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 10
weeks, 12 weeks or more prior to administering the sclerostin inhibitor to the subject. In
preferred embodiments, the periodontal disease progression in the subject is slowed, halted or
reversed prior to administration of the sclerostin inhibitor.
[00115]     In some or any embodiments, a method or use described herein further comprises
administering an antibiotic, such as an antibiotic selected from the group consisting of
amoxicillin, tetracycline hydrochloride, doxycycline, minocycline, azithromycin,
                                                  )n

    WO 2013/101451                                                          PCT/US2012/068975
roxithromycin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. In some embodiments, the
method or use comprises administering the antibiotic to the subject prior to administering the
sclerostin inhibitor to the subject. In other embodiments, the method or use comprises
administering the antibiotic to the subject concurrently with the administration of the
sclerostin inhibitor.
[00116]     In some embodiments, the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti-sclerostin antibody or
antibody fragment) is administered along with a second bone-enhancing therapeutic useful
for the treatment of decreased bone mineral density or bone defect. In some embodiments,
the bone-enhancing therapeutic is selected from the group consisting of an anti-resorptive
drug, a bone-forming agent, an estrogen receptor modulator (including, but not limited to,
raloxifene, bazedoxifene and lasofoxifene) and a drug that has an inhibitory effect on
osteoclasts. In some embodiments, the second bone-enhancing agent is selected from the
group consisting of a bisphosphonate (including, but not limited to, alendronate sodium
(FOSAMAX®), risedronate, ibandronate sodium (BONIVA®) and zoledronic acid
(RECLAST®)); an estrogen or estrogen analogue; an anti-RANK ligand (RANKL) antibody
(e.g., PROLIA®) or RANKL inhibitor; vitamin D, or a vitamin D derivative or mimic
thereof; a calcium source, Tibolone, calcitonin, a calcitriol; and hormone replacement
therapy. In some embodiments, the second bone-enhancing agent includes, but is not limited
to parathyroid hormone (PTH) or a peptide fragment thereof, PTH-related protein (PTHrp),
bone morphogenetic protein, osteogenin, NaF, a PGE 2 agonist, a statin, strontium ranelate, an
anti-DKK1 antibody or inhibitor. In some embodiments, the second bone-enhancing agent is
Forteo@ (Teriparatide), Preotact@, or Protelos@.
[00117]     In various embodiments, the periodontal disease treatment plan includes regular
supportive follow-up therapy after active treatment with the sclerostin inhibitor is completed.
In some embodiments, the method or uses described herein optionally comprise performing a
supportive follow-up therapy selected from the group consisting of mechanical debridement,
reinforcement of oral hygiene (e.g., regular profession cleanings (i.e., every 6 months), daily
brushing and flossing) and administration of antibiotics.
[00118]     In some embodiments, the combination therapy employing a sclerostin inhibitor
described herein may precede or follow administration of additional therapeutic(s) (e.g., an
antibiotic or second bone-enhancing agent) by intervals ranging from minutes to weeks. For
example, separate modalities are administered within about 24 hours of each other, e.g.,
within about 6-12 hours of each other, or within about 1-2 hours of each other, or within
about 10-30 minutes of each other. In some situations, it may be desirable to extend the time

(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 weeks) lapse between the respective administrations of different
modalities. Repeated treatments with one or both agents/therapies of the combination
therapy is specifically contemplated.
[00119]      Maintenance Therapeutic Regimen
[00120]      Also contemplated is the use of a second bone-enhancing agent and/or sclerostin
inhibitor in a maintenance regimen to, e.g., prevent or slow the loss of one or more of the

bone mass, alveolar bone volume and alveolar bone mineral content. In this regard, a method
or use described herein optionally comprises administering one or more amounts of a second
bone-enhancing agent effective to maintain bone mineral density, alveolar bone height,
alveolar bone mass, alveolar bone volume and alveolar bone mineral content for a
maintenance period of about 1 week to about 5 years after the treatment period with the
sclerostin antibody has ended. For example, in some embodiments, a method or use

[00122]      Kits
[00123]      A pharmaceutical composition comprising the sclerostin inhibitor (e.g., anti
sclerostin antibody or antibody fragment) may be placed within containers (e.g., vials or
syringes), along with packaging material that provides instructions regarding the use of such
pharmaceutical compositions. Generally, such instructions will include a tangible expression
describing the sclerostin inhibitor concentration, as well as within certain embodiments,
relative amounts of excipient ingredients or diluents (e.g., water, saline or PBS) that may be
necessary to reconstitute the pharmaceutical composition.
[00124]      The invention is further described in the following examples. The following
examples serve only to illustrate the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the
invention in any way.
                                           EXAMPLES
Example 1
[00125]      This Example describes various cell-based neutralization assays useful for
characterizing the neutralization activity of an anti-sclerostin antibody.
[00126]      MC3T3 cell-based mineralization assay - Ascorbic acid and B-glycerophosphate
are used to induce MC3T3-El-BF cell differentiation leading to mineral deposition. An
exemplary screening protocol, in 96-well format, involves plating cells on day 1, followed by
seven media changes over a 12-day period with most of the mineral deposition taking place
in the final eighteen hours. The specific timing, and extent, of mineral deposition may vary
depending, in part, on the particular serum lot number being used. Control experiments will
allow such variables to be accounted for, as is well known in the art of cell culture

    WO 2013/101451                                                         PCT/US2012/068975
experimentation generally. For statistical analysis (using MS Excel and JMP) a 1-way
ANOVA followed by Dunnett's comparison may be used to determine differences between
groups. Group means for each data set are considered significantly different when the P
value is less than 0.05 (P < 0.05).
[00127]     Cell culture for expansion of MC3T3-El-BF cells is performed as follows. Cell
culture is performed at 37 0C and 5% CO 2 . A cell bank can be generated for the purposes of
screening for sclerostin neutralizing antibodies. One vial of frozen MC3T3-El-BF cells are
thawed by agitation in a 37 0 C water bath. The thawed cells are put into 10 mls of Expansion
Medium (Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu) in a 50 ml tube and gently spun down for 5
minutes. The cells are then resuspended in 4 mls of Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu.
After determining the number of cells using trypan blue and hemacytometer, 1 x 106 cells are
plated in 50 mls Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu media in one T175 flask.
[00128]     When this passage is confluent (at approximately 7 days), the cells are trypsinized
with trypsin/EDTA (0.05% Trypsin; 0.53 mM EDTA), gently spun down for 5 minutes and
then resuspended in 5 mls Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu. After determining the
number of cells using trypan blue and hemacytometer, cells are plated at 1 x 106 cells in 50
mls Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu media per one T175 flask. The number of T175
flasks used for plating at this point depends upon the total cell number available and the
desired number of flasks that are to be taken forward to the next passage.
[00129]     When this passage is confluent (about 3-4 days), the cells are trypsinized with
trypsin/EDTA (0.05% Trypsin; 0.53 mM EDTA), gently spun down for 5 minutes and then
resuspended in 5 mls Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu.            After determining the number of
cells using trypan blue and hemacytometer, cells are plated at 1 x 106 cells in 50 mls Alpha
MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu media per one T175 flask. The number of T175 flasks used for
plating at this point depends upon the total cell number available and the desired number of
flasks that were to be taken forward to the next passage.
[00130]     When this passage is confluent (about 3-4 days), the cells are trypsinized with
trypsin/EDTA (0.05% Trypsin; 0.53 mM EDTA), gently spun down for 5 minutes and then
resuspended in 5 mls Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu.            After determining the number of
cells using trypan blue and hemacytometer, cells are plated at 1 x 106 cells in 50 mls Alpha
MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu media per one T175 flask. The number of T175 flasks used for
plating at this point depends upon the total cell number available and the desired number of

flasks that were to be taken forward to the next passage. Extra cells are frozen down at 1-2 x
106 live cells/ml in 90%FBS/10%DMSO.
[00131]      When this passage is confluent (about 3-4 days), the cells were trypsinized with
trypsin/EDTA (0.05% Trypsin; 0.53 mM EDTA), gently spun down for 5 minutes and then
resuspended in 5 mls Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu.              After determining the number of
cells using trypan blue and hemacytometer, the cells are frozen down at 1-2 x 106 live
cells/ml in 90%FBS/10%DMSO. This "final passage" of frozen cells is the passage used for
the screening assay.
[00132]      Cell culture for mineralizing MC3T3-E1-BF cells is performed as follows. Cell
culture is performed at 37 0C and 5% CO 2. It is desirable to minimize temperature and % CO 2
fluctuations during the mineralization cell culture procedure. An appropriate number of
"final passage" vials prepared as described above are thawed by agitation in a 37 0C water
bath. The thawed cells are put into 10 mls of Expansion Medium (Alpha
MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu) in a 50 ml tube and gently spun down for 5 minutes. The cells
are then resuspended in 4 mls of Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu.             After determining the
number of cells by trypan blue and hemacytometer, 2500 cells are plated in 200 microliters of
Expansion media per well on collagen I coated 96-well plates (Becton Dickinson Labware,
cat # 354407).
[00133]      An exemplary cell culture procedure is as follows. The starting day for plating the
cells is indicated to be a Wednesday. If a different day of the week is used as the starting day
for plating the cells, that day will trigger the daily schedule for removing and adding media
during the entire process as indicated below. For example, if the cells are plated on a
Tuesday, media should not be removed and added on the first Friday and Saturday, nor on the
second Friday and Saturday. With a Tuesday start, the plates would be prepared for the
calcium assay on the final Sunday. Cells are plated on a Wednesday at 2500 cells in 200 [1
of Expansion media. On Thursday all of the Expansion media is removed and 200 [1 of
Differentiation Media is added. On Friday 100 [1 of media is removed and 100 [1 of fresh
Differentiation Media is added. On Monday 100 [1 of media is removed and 100 p1 of fresh
Differentiation Media is added. On Tuesday 100 p1 of media is removed and 100 p1 of fresh
Differentiation Media is added. On Wednesday 100 p1 of media is removed and 100 pl of
fresh Differentiation Media is added. On Thursday 100 p1 of media is removed and 100 p1 of
fresh Differentiation Media is added. On Friday 100 p1 of media is removed and 100 p1 of
fresh Differentiation Media is added. On the following Monday plates are prepared for the
calcium assay as follows: Plates are washed once with 10 mM Tris, HCl pH 7-8. Working

under a fume hood, 200 p1 of 0.5 N HCl is added per well. Plates are then frozen at -80'C.
Just prior to measuring calcium, the plates are freeze-thawed twice, and then trituration with a
multichannel pipette is used to disperse the contents of the plate. The contents of the plate is
then allowed to settle at 40 C for 30 minutes at which point an appropriate amount of
supernatant is removed for measuring calcium using a commercially available calcium kit.
An exemplary and not-limiting kit is Calcium (CPC) Liquicolor, Cat. No. 0150-250, Stanbio
Laboratory, Boerne, TX.
[00134]      In this cell based assay, sclerostin inhibits one or more of the sequence of events
leading up to and including mineral deposition (i.e. sclerostin inhibits mineralization). Thus,
in experiments where sclerostin is included in the particular cell culture experiment, the
recombinant sclerostin is added to the media starting on the first Thursday and every feeding
day thereafter. In cases where an anti-sclerostin antibody is being tested for the ability to
neutralize sclerostin, i.e., allow for mineralization by neutralizing sclerostin's ability to
inhibit mineralization, the antibody is added to the media starting on the first Thursday and
every feeding day thereafter. The antibody is preincubated with the recombinant sclerostin in
Differentiation media for 45-60 minutes at 37 0 C and then this media is used for feeding the
cells.
[00135]      Described above is a 12-day mineralization protocol for MC3T3-E1-BF cells.
Mineralization of the original MC3T3-E1 cells is inhibited by recombinant sclerostin and this
inhibition is blocked using an anti-sclerostin neutralizing antibody, e.g., an anti-sclerostin
antibody comprising CDRs of SEQ ID NO: 245-247 and 78-80. The cell-based
neutralization assay is further described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 7,592,429 at, e.g.,
Example 8 (hereby incorporated by reference for its description of cell-based neutralization
assays).
[00136]     Bone specific alkalinephosphataseassay - An exemplary bone specific alkaline
phosphatase assay is described in International Patent Publication No. WO 2008/115732 and
U.S. Patent No. 7,744,874 (hereby incorporated by reference for its description of cell-based
neutralization assays). An exemplary protocol is as follows. C2C12 cells (ATCC, CRL
1772) are plated at 3000-5000 cells/well in a 96-well tissue culture plate in MEM medium
supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. The plate is incubated at 37 0 C in 5% CO 2 overnight.
The antibody is diluted in 0.5X Wnt3a-conditioned medium (prepared as described in WO
2008/115732) to various final concentrations. The medium is removed from the plated cells
and a pre-mixed antibody- BMP4-sclerostin solution (human or cynomologous monkey) is
added (150        providing an antibody final concentration of 30 g/ml to 0.5 g/ml, a final
               1al),

BMP-4 concentration of 25 ng/ml, a final sclerostin protein concentration of 1.0 ig/ml, and
the conditioned medium is at 0.5X concentration. The plate is then incubated at 37'C in 5%
CO 2 for 72 hours. The medium is removed from the cells, which are washed once with PBS,
and frozen and thawed three times alternating between -80 0 C and 37 0 C. Alkaline
phosphatase activity is measured by adding alkaline phosphatase substrate (1-step PNPP,
Pierce #37621) (150 pl/well). The plate of cells is incubated for 60 minutes at room
temperature, at which time optical density (OD) is measured at 405 nm to determine alkaline
phosphatase activity. IC50 calculations may be performed using, e.g., SigmaPlot Regression
Wizard with a Sigmoid 4-parameter fit equation.
[00137]      BMP2-induced MC3T3 cell mineralizationassay - An exemplary BMP2-induced
mineralization assay in MC3T3 cells is described in International Patent Publication No. WO
2009/047356 (hereby incorporated by reference for its description of cell-based neutralization
assays). Briefly, MC3T31b cells are seeded in 96-well plates (e.g., 6 x 103 cells/well or 2 x
103 cells/well) in 100 1dassay culture medium (maintenance culture medium without G418)
and incubated for three days to reach confluence. The assay culture medium is changed and
compounds to be tested are added with 10 mM b-glycerophosphate and 50 iM ascorbic acid.
Prior to addition to the cells, sclerostin and a candidate antibody are pre-incubated on a
separate plate for two hours at room temperature. To the assay 96 well-plates, 2.1 or 2.8 nM
BMP-2 (R&D Systems, Cat#355-BM-0 10) is applied before applying the sclerostin-antibody
mixture. Cells are incubated for 14 days. At the end of the incubation, cells are washed
twice with 200 1dPBS/well, 50 pl of 0.5 M HCl is added to each well, and plates are frozen
at -20 0 C for a minimum of 24 hours. Plates are thawed at room temperature for 2 hours for
testing. Ten 10 1 of each well is transferred to a new plate and exposed to Calcium Working
Solution (1:5) (200 1). Optical density is measured after a 5-30 minute incubation period at
595 nm on a microplate reader. Absorbance is translated into microgram of calcium
according to a standard curve, allowing determination of the extent of BMP-2-induced
mineralization.
[00138]      Cell-basedwnt signalingassay - An exemplary cell-based signaling assay
employing super top flash (STF) reporter protein is described in International Patent
Publication No. WO 2009/047356. HEK293 cells are transfected with pcDNA3+ (480 ng);
SuperTopFlash (STF) (20 ng); and phRL-CMV (0.5 ng) for control wells and pcDNA-wntl
(20 ng); pcDNA3+ (460 ng); SuperTopFlash (STF) (20 ng); and phRL-CMV (0.5 ng) for

application to the cells. Once applied, the cells are incubated at 37 0 C in 5% CO 2 for five
hours.
[00139]     Antibodies are premixed with SOST to generate a series of dilutions. One ml of
medium for each dilution is prepared, and 450 1dis added to each well after removing
transfection mix. The cells are incubated with the antibody-SOST mixtures for 18-20 hours.
At the end of the incubation, medium is removed, and 300 tl of IX Passive Lysis Buffer
(Promega, Cat#E194A) is added to lyse cells. Luciferase activity is then measured using
Dual-Glo Luciferase System (Promega, Cat#E2940) with 30 tl of lysates in duplicates.
Typically, 30[tl of Dual-Glo luciferase (firefly luciferase; for STF) and 30[tl of Dual-Glo Stop
and Glo (Renilla luciferase; for transfection efficiency control) substrates is used.
Luminescent signals are measured with Mithras LB940 instrument (Berthold Technologies).
The ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferases is calculated. The final results are expressed by
setting the value of Wntl without SOST as 1. Additional details of the assay are provided in
International Patent Publication No. WO 2009/047356.
Example 2
[00140]     The following Example illustrates the ability of a sclerostin inhibitor, namely an
anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody (Scl-Ab), to enhance alveolar bone repair in a rat
periodontal disease model.
[00141]     Rat periodontitismodel: Experimental periodontal disease was induced in rats by
ligature placement as described previously (Jin       Q, et al., 2007. J Periodontol 78:1300-1308;
Graves, DT, et al., 2008. J Clin Periodontol 35:89-105; the disclosures of which are
incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). Briefly, male Sprague Dawley rats (body
weight, approx. 300-350 g, Harlan Laboratory, IN) were anesthetized with ketamine and
xylazine (83/17 ratio). Cotton suture (3.0) was then secured around the cervical part (just
above the gingivae) of the molars on one side of the maxilla, to allow for normal mastication.
The ligatures were evaluated three times per week, gently displaced apically into the gingival
sulci to ensure a subgingival position, and replaced when necessary.
[00142]     Microcomputed Tomography (pCT) Scanning and Analysis: Rats were sacrificed
at designated time points. Maxillae were dissected and placed into 10% neutral buffered
formalin for 48-72 hrs. Fixed, non-demineralized rat maxillae were scanned in 70% ethanol
by a cone beam microCT system (GE Healthcare BioSciences). Linear and volumetric
analyses were based on a previously developed methodology (Park CH, et al., 2007. J
Periodontol 78:273-281). In brief, each maxillar specimen was scanned and reconstructed at
                                                  A '7

    WO 2013/101451                                                          PCT/US2012/068975
18 x 18 x 18-pim voxels using a iCT system. A three-dimensional (3-D) volume viewer and
analyzer software (Microview Analysis, GE Healthcare) were used as the tool for both 3-D
and 2-D visualization and quantification. The vertical, linear bone loss was identified by
measuring the distance from the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) to the alveolar bone crest
(ABC) of the maxillary second molar. In terms of volumetric analysis, the most mesial root
of the first molar (m-M 1), the most distal root of the third molar (d-M3), the roof of the
furcation, and root apex of M1-M3 were used as reproducible landmarks for assessment of
maxillary alveolar bone. Two dimensional regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn at regular
intervals (average, eight data slices) on a coronal view and reconstructed as a 3-D structure to
quantify volumetric parameters, bone volume fraction (BVF), and bone mineral density
(BMD; mg/cc).
[00143]      Statisticalanalysis: GraphPad Prism (V.5.01) was used to perform the statistic
analysis. The differences among groups for linear and volumetric bone measurements were
statistically assessed by one-way analysis of variation (ANOVA) with Tukey multiple
comparison post hoc test. Data were reported as Mean+ SE, and the level of significance was
set as P <0.05.
[00144]      Study Design: Ten to twelve week old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats underwent
experimental periodontitis induced by ligature placement as described above. In one mode of
study, three days before the ligature placement, animals (n=10/group) were subcutaneously
injected once with either saline vehicle or Scl-Ab (dose level of 25 mg/kg). Immediately
after the ligature placement, ligated animals or their normal intact controls were treated with
either saline vehicle or Scl-Ab. Both Scl-Ab (dose level of 25 mg/kg) and its vehicle control
were given by subcutaneous injection twice per week. Necropsy were performed two-week
and four-week post-disease induction respectively.
[00145]      In another mode of study, following four weeks of ligature-induced experimental
periodontitis, treatment was commenced immediately following removal of the ligature.
Animals (n=10/group) with experimental periodontitis or their normal intact controls were
subcutaneously injected twice weekly with either saline vehicle or Scl-Ab (dose level of 25
mg/kg). The treatment lasted for three weeks or six weeks following cessation of disease
induction for a total study duration of seven or ten weeks. Body weight measurements were
taken weekly prior to Scl-Ab administration until the termination of the study. Necropsies
were performed seven-weeks and ten-weeks post-disease induction, respectively. Whole

the Institution Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Michigan.

[00146]      Results:
[00147]      Maxillary alveolar bone: microCT measurements of supporting alveolar bone
volume and density are set forth in Figures 2 and 3. In the mode of the study where the
ligature was placed throughout the study (two-week and four-week), systemic Scl-Ab
administration in the normal intact animal group resulted in a statistically significant increase
in both bone volume fraction (BVF) and bone mineral density (BMD) when compared to
normal intact animals receiving vehicle injections at two and four weeks following initiation
of treatment. Furthermore, ligature-induced periodontal disease groups receiving systemic
Scl-Ab injections showed increased BVF and BMD (although not statistically significant)
values than the disease group receiving vehicle injections at the two- and four-week time
points (Figures 2A and 2B).
[00148]      In the mode of the study where the ligature was removed four-week after
placement and immediately before treatment commencement both BVF and BMD showed a
statistically significant decrease during the disease induction phase in the experimental
periodontitis groups compared to the normal intact animal groups. Within three weeks
following cessation of disease induction, BVF and BMD in the vehicle treatment group
rebounded and then stabilized until the end of the study. Ligated animals receiving Scl-Ab
treatment following induction of experimental periodontitis exhibited improved bone repair
(i.e., greater bone volume and density values) throughout the six-week treatment phase
compared to animal groups receiving vehicle injections. Most important, after six-weeks of
treatment, BVF and BMD were statistically higher in animals treated with Scl-Ab than in
vehicle-treated animal group. Furthermore, no statistical difference was found in the bone
volume fraction and bone density between the Scl-Ab treated disease animals and vehicle
treated normal intact animals at the end of 10- week study, indicating that Scl-Ab may aid in
the regeneration of alveolar bone to healthy normal levels following periodontal disease.
[00149]      Linear bone measurement: Alveolar bone height was measured from the bone
crest to the cement-enamel junction of second molar with microCT assessment (Figure 4).
In the mode of the study where the ligature was removed four-week after placement and
immediately before treatment commencement, scl-Ab administration showed some effects on
the linear bone repair (i.e., increased alveolar bone height). After three-weeks of treatment,
no statistical significance of the linear bone measurement was observed between the Scl-Ab
treatment and vehicle groups at the ligated second molar site. However, at the six-week post
treatment time point, Scl-Ab treatment showed an augment in linear bone repair - with a

statistically significant difference evident between the vehicle and Scl-Ab treatment groups
and vehicle groups at the ligated second molar site (Figures 4A-4C).
[00150]      Systemic administration of Scl-Ab for six weeks following induction of
experimental periodontitis resulted in statistically greater BVF and BMD values compared to
vehicle treatment as well as statistically similar bone measures to the normal intact group.
Thus, systemic Scl-Ab administration contributes to alveolar bone regeneration as measured
by BVF and BMD. Scl-Ab may hold promise as a therapeutic to augment and/or accelerate
oral bone regeneration.
