   Description of the Related Art
   [0002]       United States Patent Number 6,234,853, which issued to Lanyi et al. on May
   22, 2001, discloses a docking system which utilizes the marine propulsion unit of a
15 marine vessel, under the control of an engine control unit that receives command signals
   from a joystick or push button device, to respond to a maneuver command from the
   marine operator. The docking system does not require additional propulsion devices other
   than those normally used to operate the marine vessel under normal conditions. The
   docking or maneuvering system uses two marine propulsion units to respond to an
20 operator's command signal and allows the operator to select forward or reverse
   commands in combination with clockwise or counterclockwise rotational commands
   either in combination with each other or alone.
   [0003]       United States Patent Number 7,267,068, which issued to Bradley et al. on
   September 11, 2007, discloses a marine vessel which is maneuvered by independently
25 rotating first and second marine propulsion devices about their respective steering axes in
   response to commands received from a manually operable control device, such as a
   joystick. The marine propulsion devices are aligned with their thrust vectors intersecting

   at a point on a centerline of the marine vessel and, when no rotational movement is
   commanded, at the center of gravity of the marine vessel. Internal combustion engines
   are provided to drive the marine propulsion devices. The steering axes of the two marine
   propulsion devices are generally vertical and parallel to each other. The two steering axes
 5 extend through a bottom surface of the hull of the marine vessel.
                              BRIEF SUMMARY OF INVENTION
   [0004]      There is provided a mounting assembly for a marine vessel having a bow, a
   stern, a center of rotation and a pair of stern-mounted propulsion units, each propulsion
10 unit having a total steering range. The assembly comprises a pair of angle-setting
   members which forwardly angle the propulsion units towards the bow of the marine
   vessel when each propulsion unit is at the center of the total steering range. Each
   propulsion unit may have a line of action of its propulsion force. The lines of action of
   the propulsion units may intersect each other between the center of rotation of the marine
15 vessel and the stern of the marine vessel when the propulsion units are steered forwardly
   towards each other. The marine vessel may be a twin-hulled vessel.
   [0005]      The marine vessel may have a longitudinal axis. The angle-setting members
   may angle the propulsion units inwardly and forwardly in the range of greater than 0
   degrees and less than 30 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis of the marine vessel.
20 The angle-setting members may angle the propulsion units inwardly and forwardly in the
   range of 5 to 10 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis of the marine vessel. The angle
   setting members may angle the propulsion units inwardly and forwardly by 6 degrees
   relative to the longitudinal axis of the marine vessel. Each of the angle-setting members
   may comprise an inwardly biased tiller arm. Propeller axes of the propulsion units may
25 be forwardly convergent relative to the tiller arms when the tiller arms align parallel with
   the longitudinal axis of the marine vessel.
   [0006]      The angle-setting members may be wedge-shaped. Each angle-setting member
   may have a thin end and a thick end. The thick ends of the angle-setting members may be
                                                 2

   positioned to face each other. There may be a pair of stern brackets which are operatively
   connected to respective ones of the propulsion units. The angle-setting members may be
   connected to the stern brackets. The angle-setting members may be integrally connected
   to and integrally formed with the stern brackets.
 5 [0007]      The marine vessel may have a transom. There may be a pair of stem brackets
   operatively connected to respective ones of the propulsion units. The angle-setting
   members may be connected to the stern brackets. The angle-setting members may be
   interposed between the stem brackets and the transom. Each angle-setting member may
   have a pair of spaced-apart apertures. There may be a plurality of fasteners. Each of the
10 fasteners may extend through a respective one of the apertures. The fasteners may
   connect the stern brackets, the angle-setting members and the transom together. The
   angle-setting members may comprise angled portions of the transom. Each angle-setting
   member may comprise an angled stern bracket that connects to the transom.
   [0008]      There is also provided a mounting assembly for a marine vessel having a pair
15 of stern-mounted propulsion units with a total steering range. The assembly comprises a
   pair of stops which allow the propulsion units to steer to a maximum steering range. The
   maximum steering range is one half of the total steering range plus an angle 0 on a first
   side and one half of the total steering range less the angle 0 on a second side.

                   DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 5
   [0027]      Referring to the drawings and first to Figure 1, there is shown a mounting
   assembly 30 for a marine vessel 10. The vessel 10 has a bow 12, a stem 14 which is
   spaced-apart from the bow, a transom 16 located at the stem, a port side 18 and a
   starboard side 20 which is spaced-apart from the port side. The sides 18 and 20 of the
10 vessel 10 extend from the stern 14 to the bow 12. The sides 18 and 20 of the vessel 10 are
   further spaced-apart in this example compared to a more conventional, narrower beamed
   vessel. Alternatively, the vessel 10 may be stem heavy compared to a conventional
   vessel. The vessel 10 has a longitudinal axis or centerline 200 which extends from the
   stern 14 to the bow 12 and which is situated between the sides 18 and 20 of the vessel.
15 The vessel 10 has a lateral axis 210 that extends perpendicular to the centerline 200 from
   the side 18 to the side 20.
   [0028]      The vessel 10 has a plurality of engines, in this example a pair of engines in
   the form of a port engine 32 located adjacent to the port side 18 and a starboard engine 34
   located adjacent to the starboard side 20. The engines 32 and 34 have propeller axes 36
20 and 38, respectively, as seen in Figure 1, which correspond to the lines of action of their
   propulsion forces. As seen in Figures 7 to 9, the vessel 10 has a center of rotation 40,
   which may correspond to the center of gravity of the vessel in its static state. It is possible
   to apply the improvement to vessels that have three engines, where the outer two engines
   are far apart from each other. Angling the outer engines in a manner similar to the two
25 engine embodiment illustrated herein can achieve a similar result. This description
   focuses on illustrating the improvement with two engines.
   [0029]      Referring back to Figure 1, the mounting assembly 30 has a pair of stern
   brackets 42 and 44 which are operatively connected to the outboard engines 32 and 34,
                                                 6

   respectively. One of the stern brackets 42 is shown in greater detail in Figure 3. The stem
   bracket 42 has a connector portion 46 facing the transom 16 of the vessel 10, shown in
   Figure 1. The outboard engines and stem brackets in this embodiment are conventional,
   with parts and functionings well known to those skilled in the art, and therefore will not
 5 be described in further detail.
   [0030]      The mounting assembly 30 includes a plurality of angle-setting members, in
   this example a pair of spaced-apart members for each engine, as shown by members 48
   and 50 for the engine 32 in Figure 3. Only upper members 48 and 52 for the respective
   engines 32 and 34 are seen in Figure 1. The angle-setting members are configured to
10 position the engines 32 and 34 with a slight forward convergence that is angled towards
   the centerline 200 when the engines are at the center of their steering ranges, thus altering
   the steering angles of the engines relative to the centerline of the vessel.
   [0031]      Each angle-setting member is wedge-shaped in this example, with a thin end
   and a thick end that is thicker than the thin end. This is shown in Figure 1 by thin ends 54
15 and 56 and thick ends 58 and 60 for the members 48 and 52, respectively. The thin ends
   54 and 56 of the angle-setting members are positioned adjacent to respective sides 18 or
   20 of the vessel 10. The thick ends 58 and 60 of the angle-setting members are positioned
   to face each other.
   [0032]      As seen in Figure 4, the angle-setting member 48 has a pair of spaced-apart
20 apertures 62 and 64, in this example, extending therethrough adjacent to its ends 54 and
   58, respectively. The angle-setting member 48 in this example has an outer face 66,
   which extends between and is perpendicular to the ends 54 and 58, and an inner face 68
   which is spaced-apart from the outer face. The inner face 68 extends between the ends 54
   and 58 at a non-perpendicular angle with respect to the ends in this example although this
25 is not essential. As seen in Figure 1, the angle-setting members 48 and 52 are interposed
   between the stern brackets 42 and 44 and the transom 16 in this example, with the inner
   face 68 of the angle-setting member 48 abutting an outer surface 70 of the transom as
                                                  7

   seen in Figure 4. The outer face 66 of the angle-setting member 48 abuts the connector
   portion 46 of the bracket 42 as shown in Figure 3.
   [0033]      As seen in Figures 4 to 6, the angle-setting member 48 includes a pair of
   wedge-shaped washers 74 and 76. Each washer has a thin end, a thick end which is
 5 thicker than the thin end, and a central aperture extending therethrough, as shown by thin
   end 78, thick end 80 and aperture 82 for the washer 76 in Figure 4. The aperture 82 of the
   washer 76 aligns with the aperture 64 of the angle-setting member 48 and an aperture 84
   of the washer 74 aligns with the aperture 62 of the angle-setting member 48. The washer
   76 in this example has a first face 86, which extends between and is perpendicular to the
10 ends 78 and 80, and a second face 88 which is spaced-apart from the first face. The face
   88 extends between the ends 54 and 58 of the angle-setting member 48 at a non
   perpendicular angle with respect to the ends in this example and abuts an inner surface 72
   of the transom 16. The transom has a pair of spaced-apart apertures 90 and 92 extending
   therethrough for the angle-setting member 48 in this example. The washer 76 and the
15 angle-setting member 48 are shaped such that the face 66 of the member 88 and the face
   86 of the washer 76 extend substantially parallel to each other when the washer and the
   angle-setting member abut the transom 16. However, the exact shape of the washer is not
   essential. The washer 74 is similar in structure and function to the washer 76 and is
   accordingly not described in detail herein.
20 [0034]      As seen in Figure 3, the mounting assembly 30 includes a plurality of
   fasteners, in this example a pair of bolts 94 and 96 for the angle-setting member 48. The
   bolts extend through the bracket 42, the apertures 62 and 64 of the angle-setting member
   48, the apertures 90 and 92 of the transom 16 and the apertures 84 and 82 of the washers
   74 and 76, and connect the bracket 42 to the transom 16. As seen in Figure 1, the angle
25 setting members 48 and 52 thus connect to the stem brackets 42 and 44.
   [0035]      Referring to Figure 1, the angle-setting member 48 causes the propeller axis
   36 of the port engine 32 to angle towards the starboard side 20 of the vessel 10 when the
   engine is at the center of its steering range as illustrated. Likewise, the angle-setting
                                                 8

   member 52 causes the propeller axis 38 of the starboard engine 34 to angle towards the
   port side 18 when the engine is at the center of its steering range. According to one
   embodiment, each propeller axis is inwardly and forwardly angled towards the centerline
   200 at an angle 0 relative to the centerline when the engines 32 and 34 are positioned to
 5 the midpoint or center of their steering ranges. In this case and referring to Figure 4, the
   outer face 66 of the angle-setting member 48 is also angularly spaced-apart from the
   lateral axis 210 of the vessel 10 and the inner face 68 of the angle-setting member 48 by
   angle P. It is practical to arrange both port and starboard angle 0 to be the same or
   symmetrical with respect to the centerline. The faces 86 and 88 of the washer 76 are also
10 at angle 0 with respect to each other in this example.
   [0036]       According to one aspect, angle 0 is an angle within the range of 1 to 30
   degrees. According to another aspect, angle 0 is an angle within the range of 5 to 15
   degrees. According to a further aspect seen in Figures 1 and 2, angle 0 is substantially
   equal to 6 degrees, although other angles are possible. In this case and as seen in Figure
15 2, when the engines 32 and 34 are steered to fully forwardly converge towards each other
   at the ends of their steering ranges, the angle of separation # between the axes  36 and 38
   is equal to 72 degrees. This is in contrast to a conventional engine arrangement where the
   angle of separation would typically only be 60 degrees. Due to physical limitations, each
   engine has a total steering range. The embodiments described above allow the total
20 steering range to be maintained while having a biased steering range for the port side
   versus the starboard side. In general, one side has a steering range from center of
   (total-steering-range/2+3). The opposite side has a steering range from center of
   (total-steering-range/2-p).
   [0037]       Other angles may be used depending on the geometry of the vessel. For
25 example, angle 0 may be equal to 12 degrees in another example. In this example, the
   steering range of the port engine extends within the range of 42 degrees to port and 18
   degrees to starboard. The steering range of the starboard engine in this example extends
   within the range of 18 degrees to port and 42 degrees to starboard.
                                                  9

   [0038]       The propeller axes 36 and 38 of the engines 32 and 34 intersect at a point of
   intersection 98 along the centerline 200 of the vessel 10, as seen in Figure 9, when the
   engines are fully steered towards the centerline. The angle-setting members 48 and 52
   enable the point of intersection 98 to be further rearward towards the stern 14 of the
 5 vessel 10 compared to a conventional, wide-berthed or stern-heavy vessel. According to
   one aspect, the angle-setting members 48 and 52 are configured so that the point of
   intersection 98 is at or aft of the center of rotation 40. Thus, the angle-setting members 48
   and 52 allow the point of intersection 98 to be aft of the center of gravity (or rotation) of
   the vessel 10. Positioning the point of intersection 98 rearward of the center of rotation 40
10 allows the vessel 10 to have counter-clockwise rotational adjustment while moving
   sideways, pure sideways movement and clockwise rotational adjustment while moving
   sideways.
   [0039]       In order to achieve pure sideways movement, a forward-moving propeller 100
   of a first one of the engines, in this example port engine 32, has a line of action 102 with
15 a forward propulsion force as seen in Figure 8. A reverse-moving propeller 104 of a
   second one of the engines, in this example starboard engine 34, has a line of action 106
   with a rearward propulsion force. Since the longitudinal components of the two
   propulsion vectors, in this example the line of action 102 of a forward propulsion force
   and the line of action 106 of a rearward propulsion force, are equal and opposite, the
20 longitudinal components cancel each other. The biased steering range created by the
   angle-setting members 48 and 52 allows the engine propellers 100 and 104 to be steered
   further towards each other. The angle-setting members 48 and 52 thus enable alignment
   of the point of intersection 98 with the center of rotation 40 as shown in Figure 8. When
   the point of intersection 98 is at the center of rotation 40, the propulsion force 102 of the
25 port engine 32 will not create a rotational moment on the vessel 10. Likewise, the
   propulsion force 106 of the starboard engine 34 will not create a rotational moment on
   the vessel 10. Since the longitudinal components of the two propulsion vectors cancel
   each other, the lateral components of the two propulsion vectors are summed to provide a
   pure sideways movement towards starboard from the point of view of Figure 8. Thus,
                                                   10

   with the balanced values of steering angles, propulsion forces and moments, the vessel 10
   may move purely sideways.
   [0040]      The biased steering range created by the angle-setting members 48 and 52
   alternatively or additionally allows heading corrections during sideways movement. For
 5 example, as shown in Figure 9, when the engine propellers 100 and 104 are steered fully
   towards each other so the point of intersection 98 is rearward of the center of rotation 40,
   the propulsion forces create a counter-clockwise rotation to the vessel 10 while moving
   sideways to starboard. Conversely, when the engine propellers 100 and 104 are steered
   towards each other so that the point of intersection 98 is forward of the center of rotation
10 40, as shown in Figure 7, the propulsion forces create a clockwise rotation to the vessel
   while moving sideways to starboard. The biased steering range created by the angle
   setting members 48 and 52 accordingly allows the vessel to have clockwise rotational
   adjustment and counter-clockwise rotational adjustment while moving sideways to
   starboard. Similarly, the biased steering range also allows the vessel to have clockwise
15 rotational adjustment, counter-clockwise rotational adjustment and pure sideways
   movement while moving sideways to port.
   [0041]      Both clockwise rotational adjustment and counter-clockwise rotational
   adjustment while moving sideways are important in practice. External forces such as
   wind and current may cause the vessel to rotate unintentionally. Allowing the steering
20 angles to be adjusted slightly provides a smooth maneuver as opposed to shifting gears
   and steering rudders with large angles. For vessel command functionality, it is desirable
   that the engines point towards the center of rotation 40, or what is generally referred to as
   the vessel's center of gravity. It is also desirable that the engine angle should not be at its
   maximum while pointing towards this center and the angle-setting members as herein
25 described facilitate this objective.
   [0042]      As seen in Figure 10, when it is desired to move the vessel 10 in a straight
   ahead forward direction, the angle-setting members 48 and 52 cause propulsion forces
   108 and 110 to be "toed in" with respect to the engine mounts. The propeller axes 36 and
                                                   11

   38 represent the centers of the steering ranges. This amount of toe in towards the
   centerline 200 for movement in a straight or steered direction can be dynamically
   adjusted by an electronic power steering system so that the engines can be parallel when
   desired.
 5 [0043]      Referring to Figure 11, the biased steering range is also useful for turning as it
   can incorporate Ackerman steering geometry. The arcs 112 and 114 represent the turning
   arcs that show the turning radii. The dot 116 represents the turning center of both engines
   32 and 34. Especially when the vessel is moving slowly, this allows smoother steering
   with less slip. The amount of Ackerman geometry can be dynamically changed due to
10 vessel speed, steering load, and aggressiveness settings by a user. The turning center of
   each engine can either coincide or be different. The angle-setting members 48 and 52 are
   not required to incorporate Ackerman steering geometry, but enable the maximum
   amount of Ackerman steering geometry to be greater.
   [0044]      Figure 12 shows a mounting assembly 30.1 according to a second aspect. Like
15 parts have like numbers and functions are the same as for the assembly 30 shown in
   Figures 1 to 11 with the addition of ".1". However angle-setting members 48.1 and 50.1
   are integrally connected to and are integrally formed with a stern bracket 42.1 in this
   example. In this case each angle-setting member comprises an angled stern bracket.
   [0045]      Figure 13 shows a mounting assembly 30.2 and vessel 10.2 according to a
20 third aspect. Like parts have like numbers and functions as the assembly 30 and vessel 10
   shown in Figures 1 to 11 with the addition of ".2". However angle-setting members 48.2
   and 52.2 comprise outwardly angled portions 118 and 120 of a transom 16.2. The angled
   portions are each located adjacent to a respective one of sides 18.2 and 20.2.
   [0046]      Figures 14 and 15 show a mounting assembly 30.3 and vessel 10.3 according
25 to a fourth aspect. Like parts have like numbers and functions as the assembly 30 and
   vessel 10 shown in Figures 1 to 11 with the addition of ".3". However angle-setting
   members 48.3 and 52.3 comprise biased tillers 122 and 124. In this configuration,
                                                12

   engines 32.3 and 34.3 are configured such that when the tillers 122 and 124 are held
   parallel with a centerline 200.3 of the vessel 10.3, propeller axes 36.3 and 38.3 of the
   engines are forwardly convergent towards the centerline at angles 3, each of which is
   equal to 6 degrees in this example.
 5 [0047]      In a further alternative, the tillers may be configured in an unbiased
   conventional manner and the outboard engines may have engine stops which are further
   spaced-apart to allow for a greater than + 30 degrees steering range. In this variation, the
   engine stops may be configured to allow steering in the range of an angle of 30 - 0
   degrees in the steering direction 126 towards the centerline and 30 + 0 degrees in the
10 opposite steering direction 128. In this case, the center point for steering is adjusted,
   making the steering asymmetrical.
   [0048]      Figures 16 and 17 show a mounting assembly 30.4 and vessel 10.4 according
   to a fifth aspect. Like parts have like numbers and functions as the assembly 30 and
   vessel 10 shown in Figures 1 to 11 with the addition of ".4". Typically engine stops are
15 spaced-apart to allow an engine to have a steering range of + 30 degrees. An outboard
   engine 32.4 in this example has a pair of engine stops 130 and 132. The engine stops in
   this example are protrusions operatively connected to a transom and stern bracket (not
   shown). The engine 32.4 has a rotating part 134 with a protrusion 136 that selectively
   abuts the engine stops 130 and 132 at the outer steering ranges of the engine 32.4. In this
20 variation, the angle-setting members are in the form of engine stops that are further
   spaced-apart, with the engine stops being altered when designing the engine to allow for
   a steering range of + (30 + 3) degrees, which in this example equals to + 36 degrees. The
   embodiment of Figures 16 and 17 can be modified to provide a total steering range of 60
   degrees. One side has (60/2+12) = 42 degrees and the other side has (60/2-12) = 18
25 degrees.
   [0049]      The forms of the angle-setting members as described herein may be referred
   to as means for positioning the outboard engines with a slight forward convergence.
                                               13

   [0050]     The assembly 30 is shown in Figure 3 with an upper angle-setting member 48
   and a lower angle-setting member 50 in the form of wedges. However, it will be
   appreciated by a person skilled in the art that many further variations are possible within
   the scope of the invention described herein. For example, one angle-setting member may
 5 be used for each stem bracket instead of two spaced-apart members for each bracket.
   Alternatively, any number of wedge-shaped pieces may be used. For example, the two
   wedges could be made of one solid piece or four separate pieces in other embodiments.
   [0051]     The angle-setting members 48 and 52 may also be built into a jack plate
   mechanism. While the assembly 30 as described herein refers to two engines, the
10 assembly as described herein may be used in conjunction with more than two engines in
   other embodiments. Alternatively, such an assembly 30 can be the engine mount which
   mates to the outboard engine midsection. For example, a metal engine mount is
   commonly used in pontoon or catamaran vessels.
   [0052]     It will be understood by a person skilled in the art that the mounting assembly
15 is described herein with reference to outboard engines but that the mounting assembly
   may also be used with stem drive or inboard-outboard propulsion systems as well.
   [0053]     It will also be understood by a person skilled in the art that many of the details
   provided above are by way of example only and are not intended to limit the scope of the
   invention which is to be determined with reference to at least the following claims.
