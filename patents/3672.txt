Abstract:
         The barrier is formed by a solid body of soft material                                       (1,
l')   with, embedded within, a series of elastic elements                                     (2, 2',
4,   5) that can be embedded directly in the body                                 (V) or embedded
within elements           (3,   3')  of a soft       material         like      that    of the body
 (1,  1'),       forming      a  type    of  bollard        inside        said       body  (1,     1').
The    internal       elastic       elements       may    be      constituted           by   helical
springs        (2,  2'),      bands   (4)   or    rods     (5)     and,      in    any event,        the
body     (1) is capable of being bent over, following the same bend
as the internal           elastic elements           (2-3',        4-3' and 5-3').

   Technological field
              The      present         technology          relates           to     a   highway       protection
   barrier, of the type called vehicle restraint barriers, such as
15 safety        barriers,            parapets,        impact           attenuators,           terminals           and
   transitions, the barrier being made of a soft material, such as
   rubber          or      any      other        elastomeric               material,         and      internally
   provided with elastic                       elements        which         in    addition      to     providing
   the      suitable          rigidity          to  the      barrier            or    fence    being         formed,
20 allow twisting and damping in vehicle impacts.
   Background
              A highway protection                 barrier          is     provided for being located
   at    the side           or    as    a    median    of     a    road,        or    even    as  a     means      for
25 demarcating             areas        to    which    access           is    prohibited,         all       of   this
   for      attenuating             the      consequences             of     accidents         or   impacts           of
   vehicles            which,          by     oversight           or        any       other     circumstance,
   uncontrollably go off the road.
              The       present           technology            seeks          to      provide        a     highway
30 protection            barrier          in   which     the      restraint            in   the   impact         of     a
   vehicle          is     based       on     damping       by     buckling,            thereby       preventing
   abrupt         impacts,          which       thus     gives          rise      to     a   minimization             of
   injuries           for the        occupants        of the           impacting           vehicle      itself        as
   well as a minimization of damages of the vehicle                                             itself.

             Vehicle restraint systems,                          such as protection barriers or
   fences         known        as    "guardrails",              usually       are      made       up     of     rigid
   elements          which,         upon      receiving          an    impact,       become         permanently
   deformed, such that the impact per se is abrupt, due precisely
 5 to the rigidity                of the fence or barrier,                    which not only entails
   serious damage to the vehicle, but also                                    important injuries                    for
   the occupants of the vehicle                            itself.
             Additionally, sometimes it is necessary for the driver of
10 a    vehicle         to     be    warned        that      he/she       has   impacted           against          the
   barrier,            since,          for     example,             if   the      latter          is      made        of
   independent             elements or bollards,                   which are completely flexible,
   an impact because                 of an oversight or because                      of not seeing those
   barrier          elements,          it    can      damage        the   vehicle        itself,          and     even
15 permanently damage                    the elements            or bollards because the                     latter
   are provided so that once the impact has stopped, they recover
   their       original          position          of vertically,            but     if     the driver            does
   not     realize         it,     he/she        can    drag       the bollard          with the vehicle,
   permanently damaging it,                         etc.

   Summary
              The     highway         protection           barrier        proposed         herein        has      been
   designed           to      ameliorate            at    least        one    of    the       aforementioned
   drawbacks, being based on a simple but effective                                              solution.
25
              In    accordance with one aspect of the present invention
   there         is     provided           a   highway           protection           barrier           provided
   for use as a separation median in roads or in urban areas
   for demarcating some areas from others, wherein:
30           the barrier             comprises a solid                body of substantially                  rubber
   material, within which is embedded a plurality of substantially
   rubber         elements          housed        in    substantially            vertical           cylindrical
   bollards;           and
              impact         detection           means       mounted        on    the       solid        body       for
35 activating            light       signaling          elements         and/or      acoustic           signaling
   elements.

                                                                  3
              In  an embodiment variant                        the barrier             has the particularity
   of having a curved profile, the concavity of which is oriented
   inwardly,          that        curved           profile             equally          affecting            the     inner
   elastic elements making up the damping means on impact                                                        against
 5 the fence or barrier.
              That     curved          configuration                   of     the     body         of     the    barrier
   provides        a    greater          ability            of    absorbing            the      impact        than     when
   the       body     of      the        barrier             and       the       inner         elastic          elements
10 themselves are straight.
              In said curved configuration of the barrier, the                                                   elastic
   elements        can be         formed by cylindrical                           bodies         forming bollards
   and,       embedded         in      the      latter,            helical          springs,           which      can       be
15 interconnected by means of horizontal sheets thereby achieving
   an inner reinforcement of the assembly.
              In  another embodiment                      variant         of the barrier                with a     curved
   configuration,               the     inner         elements           of    the      elastic           elements        are
20 made      up of metal            strips,           meshes          or   sheets, being able                    to have
   a    rough      surface           for       improving              the      grip       of      the      elastomeric
   material,         as    well        as   the helical                 springs         themselves,            while        in
   an     embodiment          alternative                 the      inner        elements           are     made     up      of
   vertical or horizontal                        rods, and always with the common                                  factor
25 that       both     the      body       of       the       barrier          and       the      elastic        damping
   elements have a curved profile for achieving greater absorption
   of the impacts.
              Therefore,            the       described                highway           protection             barrier,
30 especially          in     its       curved          configuration,                not       only       absorbs        the
   blow of the vehicle                    upon        impact          against        it     because         the    latter
   is    made     of    an     elastic          material            such       as    rubber,          but     the    inner
   elastic        elements           experience               deformation,                giving         way    together
   with        the    body        of      the         barrier,             achieving             an       attenuation
35 absorption          of the vehicle                    impacting            with the           barrier,        thereby
   preventing abrupt impacts, which in part attenuates injuries to
   the      occupants          of      the       impacted            vehicle,            even       minimizing            the
   damages to the vehicle                       itself.

                                                                 4
               The barrier is able to incorporate impact detection means
   for activating acoustic and/or light signaling elements.
 5             In an embodiment variant, the body of the barrier can be
   formed by independent                      elements like               bollards,           within which there
   is     incorporated              a   circuit          to    which        impact         detection             means       are
   associated through which means the warning signal is triggered,
   which          can    be      made      up     of     a    pressure           sensor          or    a      device         for
10 detecting           the change in              inclination             of the bollard,                 or any other
   similar           conventional               device,          such       that         when      contact            of     the
   vehicle           with       the      circuit           is    detected,              a    warning            signal         is
   generated,            being emitted through one or more speakers or similar
   elements,            also being            able       to    activate           the turning               on of        light
15 indicators             suitably           arranged          on    the       fence        in    question              and/or
   even        in   the      same     device          in     the event           that       the     latter           is    long
   enough to enable being seen from the driver's position.
               In this         embodiment variant,                      the      acoustic/light                  signaling
20 circuit          does not have                to    be     integrated            in the bollard itself,
   but      it     can     be     arranged          outside          the      latter,           such      that         only      a
   single         acoustic/light              signaling           circuit         is     necessary            for a group
   of     bollards           near      each        other,         for      which         purpose          it      has      been
   provided that                the circuit associated with the impact                                           detection
25 means         arranged in each bollard can be                                  associated with a radio
   frequency            emitting          device         of     any      type       emitting          an       activation
   signal          to    activate           the      acoustic/light                   signaling            circuit,            in
   which case said                circuit         will      incorporate the corresponding radio
   frequency           receiver        module through which the corresponding signal
30 will be activated.
               Embodiments            of     the technology                 advantageously                   facilitates
   automatically and unequivocally warning drivers of the possible
   collision           of their        vehicle against                  a bollard,            preventing damages

   Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiment
             As      can      be      seen         in     the        mentioned               figures,            in     and
   specifically            in    relation           with Figures                1,    2    and 3,       the barrier
   of the invention is                  made up of a body                   (1)     of soft         material,          such
25 as rubber from recycled tires or other materials, incorporating
   within a plurality of elastic elements                                       (2) which can be made up
   of cylindrical             bollards,           also made of soft                  material,           i.e.      rubber
   or    the     like,       where       damping          (4)      elastic            (2)     elements          will     be
   embedded within that cylindrical bollard or body, such that the
30 fence       is fixed, i.e.,               the body            (1) forming it,                  by any suitable
   system        on     the      ground,           when       it      receives             the       impact        of    an
   automotive           vehicle,         an     elastic          deformation              of     the body          (1)   of
   the barrier itself, and therefore of the corresponding elastic
   elements            (2-3),       will         occur,          as      seen        in       Figure          3,     which
35 corresponds            to     the      deformation                which         the       barrier          with      the
   elastic element housed within the body thereof experiences once
   a vehicle impacts it.

                                                                  7
             Due     to      the      nature        of     the      materials,               the       barrier          is     not
   permanently deformed given vehicle impacts, just as the elastic
   elements          (2)      with      the      cylindrical               body         (3)     in     which        they       are
   housed, but they recover their initial position when the blows
 5 are not too strong,                    further         absorbing the impact and attenuating
   the blow.
              Therefore,            the barrier             in    question is               formed by a body                    (1)
   which is solid and made of a soft material, i.e.,                                                        elastomeric,
10 such as rubber or the like, preferably obtained from the reuse
   or     recycling           of tires,            and where             the      cylindrical               elements            (3)
   like bollards, incorporating the elastic elements                                                         (2) embedded
   within, will also be solid, together forming a barrier that                                                                   is
   initially            rigid        but      deformable              in     vehicle            impacts,           with        the
15 particularity               that       those        elastic           elements            (2)      can     be    embedded
   directly         in      the      body       (1)     of the          barrier,            without           needing          the
   cylindrical bodies                      (3).
             Figures          4   to      10    inclusive             show       an     embodiment              variant          in
20 which the body                 (1')      of soft material making up the barrier has
   a bent over configuration,                           with the concavity oriented                               inwardly,
   incorporating                within         the      corresponding                  elastic           elements             (2')
   housed in          a    body      (3')      embedded within the body of soft                                     material
    (1'),      as    in     the      previous           cases,         what        happens           in    this       case       is
25 the elastic              elements           (2'-3')         are       also       curved          according           to     the
   trajectory of the body                         (1')      of the barrier.
              Instead         of     springs           (2')      as     is    depicted             in    Figures           4   and
   5,    such inner elastic                   elements           can be made up of sheets                            (4)     like
30 strips        or      leaf       springs,            also      with        the        same        curved         profile,
   making        up,      as    in     all     the      previous            cases,          damping means                  for      a
   vehicle impact.
              In   another           embodiment              variant,           the       elastic           elements           are
35 made up of rods                  (5) as        shown in Figures 8 and                            9, also with the
   curved configuration                      of the body               (1')     of the barrier,                   according
   to the curvature of the latter.

                                                               8
              In   another            embodiment           variant           shown        in     Figure        10,       the
   barrier        or      body        (1')    thereof,           is     able        to     incorporate           within
   motion        sensors          (7)     which,       after        an    impact,           emit      a   warning          by
   radio       frequency          or cable to LED type lights                             (6)     incorporated in
 5 the same body of the barrier                             (1'),       warning of an impact.
              Likewise, the described highway safety barrier, in any of
   its       embodiments,               can     serve        to       support           conventional              safety
   barriers,          replacing the rigid                  metal posts holding the protective
10 metal       sheets or profiles.
              Instead         of     being      a    body       with        an      indefinite            length,          as
   depicted          in    the previously               mentioned             figures,          the barrier              can
   be formed by independent                       elements and in                  each of them an elastic
15 element,         forming a type of bollard                         in    each case of the type used
   in urban areas to serve as a barrier preventing or warning that
   the established line of bollards cannot be trespassed.
              In any case, those independent elements include a control
20 circuit          (8)      associated           with       a     power         source          (9),     preferably
   connected to the power grid, although it could be supported by
   a    rechargeable              battery         associated             with         a   photovoltaic              solar
   panel or any other conventional independent power solution.
25            An   impact         detection          device          (10)       is     associated          with        said
   control circuit, through which device                                       (10) a warning signal is
   triggered,            said      impact       detection            device          being      able to         consist
   of    a pressure            sensor such as                that mentioned for Figure                           10,       or
   such       as,     for      example,         by     means        of     a     pendulum           (11)     shown         in
30 Figures        11      and     12,      which     forms         an    electric            conductor          element
   remaining isolated from the corresponding contacts                                                    (12)     in the
   upright or vertical position of the elastic element or bollard
   in    question,           whereas         when this           latter          changes        position,           i.e.,
   it is inclined due to an impact or the pressure of the body of
35 a   vehicle          thereon,           the pendulum              (11)      tends        to    be    arranged           in
   the vertical position due to the effect of gravity, coming into
   contact with one of the                        contacts, closing the electric control
   circuit        and       the     latter       generating              an     acoustic           warning        signal

                                                                 9
   through one or more speakers                             (13)      or light          indicators             (14)    which
   would be         equivalent to the LEDs                           (6) provided in the embodiment
   shown in Figure 10.
 5           The       control         circuit             assembly             with        all       the       mentioned
   components           can be integrated within the                                 casing or body                   of the
   protection           barrier,          or     bollard           per       se,    as      depicted            in    Figure
   11,     or    the     acoustic           and/or          light         signaling           elements             could be
   arranged externally and independently to save in costs, such as
10 for example in             a post or integrated                       in    any urban fixture                   element,
   being        able    to      be   used        for       the      acoustic           signaling             due     to   the
   impact of multiple elements or bollards forming the barrier and
   having        reference          numbers           (15,       15'      and     15"),       the number              of the
   latter being able to be greater.
15
             In    said      case,      the control                circuit          (8)     will       be     associated
   with a radio frequency emitter                                 (16) of any type existing on the
   market, which in the event of a blow to the barrier or bollard
   element        (15) will generate a signal                                 (17)    that will be received
20 by    a   radio      frequency            receiver            module          (18)     which        is     associated
   with a control sub-circuit                             (8')      supported by the corresponding
   power source             (9')    through which the warning signals                                       through the
   speakers          (13')      and light indicators                         (14')       are activated.
25           In one embodiment,                    a highway barrier is                          characterized in
