             SHAFT HOISTING PLANT HAVING AN OVERWIND BRAKE DEVICE
            The      invention             relates          to      a    shaft      hoisting           plant        having        a
   conveyance            and      an     overwind            brake         device       for      the     conveyance,              a
   travel        path,        extending              in      a     longitudinal              direction,              for     the
 5 conveyance, and an overwind path adjoining a lower and/or upper
   end of the travel path.
            In     mining,           overwinding                describes            the      situation            in     which
   the conveyance comes                       to a stop only above the bank level or the
   upper filling station during shaft hoisting.
10          In     shaft       hoisting            plants,           it     is   possible,           in    the event           of
   a    defect       in     the      control,           for       the       conveyance           to     move      above       the
   upper       filling           station.            In      this         case,      a    safety         device,          which
   acts      directly           on     the       control           of      the    winding          machine,           ensures
   that      the      winding           machine           is      stopped.           The      winding          machine         is
15 then      shut       off      by     the       limit         switch          and    braked          via      the     safety
   brake.         In      the       event          that         the        limit       switch          does        not     work
   properly          or even          fails        entirely,              a    mechanical          apparatus           has     to
   greatly         reduce         the     speed        of      the       conveyance          for      safety        reasons.
   If the conveyance travels in an unbraked manner as far as under
20 the     crash        beam,        this        can     have         grave       consequences               right        up   to
   cable       breakage.            Even        at     a     low        speed     of     a    conveyance,              if     the
   conveyance            travels          in     an    unbraked manner                  under        the      crash beam,
   this       can      be     associated               with          serious         consequences                for      those
   traveling on it.
25          The      overwind            brake        device,             also     referred            to     as    overwind
   protection            system, reduces the                        consequences of overwinding. The
   overwind brake device                         is    located at the                  end of the             shaft       guide
                                                                    1

   and has        a    device         for braking,          which        slows       down       the       conveyance.
   The     braking          effect          may     only      start        above          the       upper         filling
   station        of     the      conveyance           and   after        the     limit         switch         has      been
   passed.        The      maximum          deceleration           of     the      conveyance              should          not

           In      shaft        hoisting         plants      with       guide-rail              guidance,             guide
   rails       that        are        thickened          or    inclined            with         respect           to       one
   another are used as devices for braking. The widened or pulled
   together          guide        rails        usually      consist         of     wood.         In      plants         with
10 rail      guidance,             the      devices        for     braking          can        also        consist          of
   steel.
           The       guide-rail            thickening         is    embodied            such       that      the      guide
   rails       are       enlarged           above       and     below       the        outermost             operating
   position           of      the        conveyance.            This       enlargement                  is      executed
15 symmetrically              on each          side     of  the guide            rails.         If      a   conveyance
   travels         right        into       the    thickened         portion           of     the       guide        rails,
   the     latter          is      damaged         by    the     guide         shoes          arranged            on       the
   conveyance.            The braking             with     guide-rail            thickening               takes place
   in an uncontrolled manner frequently results in the destruction
20 of the conveyance.
           Furthermore,                 an   overwind brake             device          from       SIEMAG         TECBERG
   is     known,         in     which,         during      braking,          a     braking            frame        having
   roller       boxes       is      positively          driven        on   flat        strips.           As     a   result
   of the       plastic          deformation            of  the braking              strips          in     the     roller
25 boxes,       the conveyance striking the braking frame                                           is braked. The
   overwind           brake        device        can     be     installed            at      each         end     of       the
   travel path and in both winding strands.                                        The dimensions                  of the
   flat     strips         are       selected        appropriately              for      the       shaft        hoisting

             The    object          is   achieved by an                 overwind brake            device      having
   the features of claim 1.
            Advantageous                developments of the overwind brake device are
 5 apparent from the dependent claims.
             In   order         for the       absorption             material        to be      able    to    absorb
   the energy             during braking              of    the conveyance,                a braking        path     of
   less       than        10 m        is   provided.            Retaining           elements        embodied         as
10 retaining            bars       are     fastened           to     the      overwind        path     or    to     the
   conveyance             in      pairs      and      in      a     spaced-apart            manner.       Arranged
   between        the       retaining         bars       is    energy-absorbing               material        in    the
   form       of    plates.            A   plow      that       projects           into     the    intermediate
   space        between           the      retaining           bars        is     arranged        so    as     to    be
15 movable in the longitudinal direction relative to the retaining
   bars.       The      retaining          bars     prevent          the      energy-absorbing            material
   from buckling when                     struck       by     the      plow.      The    force     transmission
   of     the    plow         takes      place       in     a    targeted          manner      to    the    energy
   absorbing           material           fixed      by     the       retaining         bars,      said     energy
20 absorbing           material           being      deformed           and/or       destroyed        during        the
   linear        relative            movement         between           the     plow     and     the    retaining
   bars       along       the     braking       path.         Insofar          as   the    braking      operation
   involves         a     deformation          of     the      energy-absorbing               material,         it   is
   a   plastic           deformation,            in     order        to     avoid     elastic        forces        that
25 oppose         the        braking         force.         The        material         properties          of      the
   energy-absorbing material are coordinated with the travel speed
   and the weight of the conveyance, including the cable weight.
             The      energy-absorbing                  material           is,     as   already        mentioned,
30 arranged          in      the      form    of    plates          one     above     another        between        the
                                                                4

   retaining          elements          embodied          as     retaining          bars.       The     plates        can
   be    arranged        one      above      another         individually              or in       the     form of a
   plurality of plate                  stacks. The            retaining bars engage preferably
   around         the    edges       of     the      plates          or    plate        stack       arranged          one
 5 above        another          in     the       longitudinal               direction,             i.e.       in     the
   direction          of    the     braking         path,        between          the    retaining          bars.      If
   the      conveyance            accidentally              travels          into      the      overwind          brake
   device        only     along       a   part-length              of    the      braking       path,       only the
   plates          destroyed          by      the      plow         in     the      process           have      to     be
10 replaced.
            Either       the      plow      is     arranged           in    a    movable        manner        and     the
   retaining          bars        are      arranged           in      a    stationary            manner        on     the
   overwind path or the plow is arranged in a stationary manner on
15 the      overwind         path       and      the     retaining            bars      are      arranged          in     a
   movable manner.
             In    order     to be       arranged          in     a movable          manner,         the plow can
   be arranged directly on the conveyance. Alternatively, the plow
20 can be        arranged         on    a movable          braking          frame      which       is   positively

   are      preferably            used        as     energy-absorbing                 material.          The      fibers
15 confer the high mechanical                             stability on the material, while the
   matrix        absorbs         the      forces         that       act    on     account      of     the    plow       and

   the guide     framework       (3),    in    each      case one plow         (9)    extends        in
   the direction of the two side walls                      (2.1) of the cage             (2),    said
   plow   (9)  having a cutting edge                  (9.1)   in   the opposite         direction
   to the direction of the braking path                       (10).   The plow (9) extends

   the retaining        bars    (6.1,    6.2)      above     the plates        (8)    of energy
   absorbing material. The overwinding conveyance                            (2) moves upward
   along the braking path             (10)    in     the guide framework             (3).     In   the
   process,    the stationary plow               (9)    destroys      the energy-absorbing
20 material    of     the    plates     (8)    between        the    retaining        bars       (6.1,
