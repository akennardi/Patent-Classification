   BACKGROUND
            Chronic pain is pain that persists beyond the expected healing time, if resulting from
   injury, and can progress from a bothersome nuisance to a profound affliction. Chronic pain
   can cause a marked alteration in behavior with depression and anxiety, restriction in daily
25 activities and excessive use of medication and medical services in an afflicted individual.
   The treatment of chronic pain is difficult, often inadequate and associated with high
   economic and psychological cost.
            Buprenorphine is a partial p-opiate receptor agonist, an ORLI/nociceptin receptor
   agonist with high affinity and a slow dissociation rate and a K-opiate receptor antagonist.
30 Buprenorphine is metabolized by the liver, via the CYP3A4 isozyme of the cytochrome P450
   enzyme system, into norbuprenorphine (by N-dealkylation) and other metabolites.
   Buprenorphine has a low oral bioavailability due to very high first-pass metabolism.
            Buprenorphine is an analgesic, available commercially as Temgesic* 0.2 mg
   sublingual tablets, and as Buprenex8 in a 0.3 mg/ml parenteral formulation. Buprenorphine

   is also available as a sublingual preparation (Subutex*) and as a sublingual abuse-resistant
   formulation with naloxone (Suboxone*). The FDA approved Suboxone/Subutex in 2002 as a
   treatment of opioid dependence. Sublingual buprenorphine has been used for opioid
   detoxification and maintenance.
 5          A recent open-label study used sublingual buprenorphine (Suboxone*) for the
   treatment of chronic pain to those chronic opioid users (Malinoff et al., 2005, American
   Journalof Therapeutics 12, 379-384). Patients were treated with daily buprenorphine doses
   that ranged from 2-20 mg (mean 8 mg). The treatment lasted from 2.4 months to 16.6
   months (mean 8.8 months). The article reports that patients experienced improvement in
10 their condition and reported a decrease in their sensation of pain.
            Still, effective methods for treating chronic pain that are not associated with adverse
   effects are needed, especially to those opioid naive or opioid experienced patients.

   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
            The present teachings provide methods for treating chronic pain by administering low
25 doses of buprenorphine twice daily (or once daily) via a mucoadhesive bioerodable drug
   delivery device. The methods and devices efficiently treat chronic pain without significant
   side effects, for example, less than 15% (preferably less than 10%, more preferably less than
   5%) patients experience constipation.

    WO 2013/096811                                                              PCT/US2012/071330
            The devices comprise about 100 Lg to 0.9 mg buprenorphine, and provide steady
   state Cmax of plasma buprenorphine concentration in a range between about 0.1 and about 1.2
   ng/mL, such that the subject is treated for chronic pain.
            In one embodiment, the buprenorphine delivery device comprises a bioerodable
 5 mucoadhesive layer comprising a therapeutically effective amount of buprenorphine disposed
   in a buffered polymeric diffusion environment, wherein the polymeric diffusion environment
   is a buffered environment having a pH of between about 4 and about 6. In another
   embodiment, the buprenorphine delivery device further comprises a barrier layer comprising
   a polymeric barrier environment disposed adjacent to the mucoadhesive layer to provide a
10 unidirectional gradient upon application to a mucosal surface for the rapid and efficient
   delivery of buprenorphine, wherein the unidirectional gradient delivers buprenorphine across
   the buffered polymeric diffusion environment upon application to the mucosal surface. In
   still another embodiment, the device comprises a mucoadhesive layer comprising an effective
   amount of buprenorphine buffered to a pH of between about 4.0 and about 6.0, and a backing
15 layer buffered to a pH between about 4.0 and about 4.8.
            In one embodiment, the device comprises about 120 [tg to 0.9 mg buprenorphine.
            The methods and devices disclosed therein can be used to treat a subject with chronic
   low back pain, such as moderate to severe chronic low back pain, or a subject with
   neuropathic pain or osteoarthritic pain.
20 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
            The present invention provides methods of treating chronic pain with low doses of
   buprenorphine. The present method of treating pain is also associated with lack of significant
   opioid adverse effects. For example, the subject is treated without experiencing any severe
   common opioid adverse effects. Or, the subject is treated experiencing mild or moderate
25 common opioid adverse effects, or no common opioid adverse effects.
            The present invention also provides effective chronic pain relief with twice daily
   administration of buprenorphine. The present invention is based, at least in part, on the
   surprising discovery that a transmucosal drug delivery device containing low doses of
   buprenorphine can be administered twice daily to opioid experienced subjects for effective
30 management and relief of chronic pain, such as chronic low back pain. The present invention
                                                   3

    WO 2013/096811                                                                PCT/US2012/071330
   is also based on the discovery that this therapy does not result in substantial side effects
   associated with opioids, such as constipation and nausea.
   Definitions
            The following definitions are provided as guidance as to the meaning of certain terms
 5 used herein.
            As used herein, the articles "a" and "an" mean "one or more" or "at least one," unless
   otherwise indicated. That is, reference to any element of the present invention by the
   indefinite article "a" or "an" does not exclude the possibility that more than one of the
   element is present.
10          As used herein, the term "acute pain" refers to pain characterized by a short duration,
   e.g., three to six months. Acute pain is typically associated with tissue damage, and
   manifests in ways that can be easily described and observed. It can, for example, cause
   sweating or increased heart rate. Acute pain can also increase over time, and/or occur
   intermittently.
15          As used herein, the term "bioavailability" is as defined in 21 CFR Section 320.1 and
   refers to the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety is absorbed from a
   drug product and becomes available at the site of action. The term "bioavailability",
   "absolute bioavailability" or "total bioavailability" refers to the total bioavailability including
   amounts that are absorbed through the oral mucosal membrane (i.e., transmucosally) and
20 through the GI mucosa of the lower GI tract. In some embodiments, the transmucosal drug
   delivery devices of the present invention provide bioavailability of buprenorphine of between
   65% and 85%. In some embodiments, the bioavailability of buprenorphine is 80%.
            As used herein, the term "bioequivalence" or "bioequivalent" is as defined in 21 CFR
   Section 320.1, and means the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent to
25 which the active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical
   alternatives becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar
   dose under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study. The pharmacokinetic
   parameters   Cmax  and AUC for bioequivalent actives fall within the 80%-125% range of each
   other.
                                                    4

    WO 2013/096811                                                                PCT/US2012/071330
            As used herein, the term "chronic pain" refers to pain which persists beyond the usual
   recovery period for an injury or illness. In one embodiment, chronic pain is the pain that lasts
   longer than one week. Chronic pain can be constant or intermittent. Common causes of
   chronic pain include, but are not limited to, arthritis, cancer, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy
 5 Syndrome (RSDS), repetitive stress injuries, shingles, headaches, fibromyalgia, and diabetic
   neuropathy.
            As used herein, the term "chronic low back pain" refers to a muscoskeletal disorder,
   wherein the subject experiences pain in the lumbar, or low back region for at least 12 weeks.
   In a specific embodiment, a subject experiences chronic low back pain for at least 3 months.
10          As used herein, the term "moderate to severe chronic low back pain" refers to the
   chronic low back pain characterized, e.g., by pain intensity of > 5 on an 11-point Numerical
   Rating Scale (NRS, wherein 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst pain
   imaginable).
            As used herein, the term "neuropathic pain" refers to a complex, chronic pain that
15 usually is accompanied by tissue injury and results from lesions or diseases affecting the
   somatosensory system. With neuropathic pain, the nerve fibers themselves may be damaged,
   dysfunctional or injured. These damaged nerve fibers send incorrect signals to other pain
   centers. The impact of nerve fiber injury includes a change in nerve function both at the site
   of injury and areas around the injury.
20          As used herein, the term "osteoarthritic pain" refers to pain resulting from
   osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease and the most common type of arthritis. It is
   associated with the degradation and loss of a cartilage that covers and cushions the ends of
   bones in normal joints. Osteoarthritis causes the cartilage in a joint to become stiff and lose
   its elasticity, making it more susceptible to damage. Over time, the cartilage may wear away
25 in some areas, greatly decreasing its ability to act as a shock absorber. As the cartilage wears
   away, tendons and ligaments stretch, causing pain. If the condition worsens, the bones could
   rub against each other, causing even more pain and loss of movement.
            As used herein, unless indicated otherwise, the term "buprenorphine", includes any
   pharmaceutically acceptable form of buprenorphine, including, but not limited to, salts,
30 esters, and prodrugs thereof. As used herein, the term "buprenorphine derivative" refers to
                                                    5

    WO 2013/096811                                                                PCT/US2012/071330
   compounds having similar structure and function to buprenorphine. In some embodiments,
   buprenorphine derivatives include those of the following formula:
                                                    R3
                                                    N
                                    R6 0O                   OCH 3
   or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters thereof, wherein
 5          /   is a double or single bond; R3 is selected from a -C1 _4 alkyl group or a cycloalkyl
   substituted-C 1 _4 alkyl group; R4 is selected from a -C1_4 alkyl; Rs is -OH, or taken together,
   R4 and Rs form a =0 group; and R6 is selected from -H or a -C1 _4 alkyl group.
           Buprenorphine derivatives include, but are not limited to, etorphine and
   diprenorphine. General buprenorphine derivatives are described in International Application
10 Publication No. WO 2008/011194, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
           As used herein, unless indicated otherwise, the term "naloxone" includes any
   pharmaceutically acceptable form of naloxone, including, but not limited to, salts, esters, and
   prodrugs thereof.
           As used herein, "non-parenteral" refers to modes of administration other than by
15 direct systemic delivery of the medicament. As such, "non-parenteral" excludes the use of
   intravenous (IV) injection, intramuscular (IM) injection, Intraperitoneal (IP) injection,
   subcutaneous (SC) injection, etc. for administration of the medicament and includes
   transdermal, oral transmucosal administration, and administration via the GI tract, generally.
           As used herein, the term "mucoadhesive layer" or "polymeric diffusion environment"
20 refers to an environment capable of allowing flux of a medicament to a mucosal surface upon
   creation of a gradient by adhesion to a mucosal surface. The flux of a transported
   medicament is proportionally related to the diffusivity of the environment which can be
                                                      6

    WO 2013/096811                                                              PCT/US2012/071330
   manipulated by, e.g., adjusting the pH, taking into account the ionic nature of the medicament
   and/or the ionic nature of the polymer or polymers included in the environment.
            As used herein, the term "backing layer" or "barrier environment" or "non-adhesive
   polymeric environment" refers to an environment in the form of, e.g., a layer or coating or
 5 barrier layer, capable of slowing, or reducing flux of a medicament from the mucoadhesive
   layer into the oral cavity. In some embodiments, the backing layer may contain a second
   medicament intended for dissolution in the saliva. In such cases, the pH of the backing layer
   is adjusted, such that it impedes flux of the medicament toward the mucoadhesive layer
   where transmucosal absorption may occur.        As used herein, the term "unidirectional
10 gradient" refers to a gradient which allows for the flux of a medicament (e.g., buprenorphine)
   through the device, e.g., through a polymeric diffusion environment, in substantially one
   direction, e.g., to the oral mucosa of a subject. For example, the polymeric diffusion
   environment may be a mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion environment in the form of a layer
   or film disposed adjacent to a backing layer or film. Upon oral mucosal application, a
15 gradient is created between the mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion environment and the
   mucosa, and the medicament flows from the mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion environment,
   substantially in one direction towards the mucosa, until the backing layer dissolves.
           As used herein, "treating" or "treatment" of a subject includes the administration of a
   drug to a subject with the purpose of preventing, curing, healing, alleviating, relieving,
20 altering, remedying, ameliorating, improving, stabilizing or affecting a disease or disorder, or
   a symptom of a disease or disorder (e.g., to alleviate pain).
           The term "subject" refers to living organisms such as humans, dogs, cats, and other
   mammals. Administration of the medicaments included in the devices of the present
   invention can be carried out at dosages and for periods of time effective for treatment of a
25 subject. In some embodiments, the subject is a human. In some embodiments, the
   pharmacokinetic profiles of the devices of the present invention are similar for male and
   female subjects.
           An "effective amount" of a drug necessary to achieve a therapeutic effect may vary
   according to factors such as the age, sex, and weight of the subject. Dosage regimens can be
30 adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, the dosage may be
   administered once daily, or may be divided into two individual dosages for twice daily
                                                    7

    WO 2013/096811                                                               PCT/US2012/071330
   administration. The dose may also be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies
   of the therapeutic situation.
           The term "transmucosal," as used herein, refers to any route of administration via a
   mucosal membrane. Examples include, but are not limited to, buccal, sublingual, nasal,
 5 vaginal, and rectal. In one embodiment, the administration is buccal. In one embodiment,
   the administration is sublingual. As used herein, the term "direct transmucosal" refers to
   mucosal administration via the oral mucosa, e.g., buccal and/or sublingual.
           As used herein, the term "water erodable" or "at least partially water erodable" refers
   to a substance that exhibits a water erodability ranging from negligible to completely water
10 erodable. The substance may readily dissolve in water or may only partially dissolve in water
   with difficulty over a long period of time. Furthermore, the substance may exhibit a differing
   erodability in body fluids compared with water because of the more complex nature of body
   fluids. For example, a substance that is negligibly erodable in water may show an erodability
   in body fluids that is slight to moderate. However, in other instances, the erodability in water
15 and body fluid may be approximately the same.
            As used herein, "addiction therapy" as related to a subject includes the administration
   of a drug to a subject with the purpose of reducing the cravings for the addictive substance.
           As used herein, the term "opioid tolerance" refers to the phenomenon in which a
   subject is less susceptible to the effect of an opioid drug as a consequence of its prior
20 administration. "Acute tolerance" describes tolerance that develops very rapidly following
   either a single dose or a few doses of opioids given over a short period of time. "Chronic
   tolerance" describes the observation that opioid administration over a longer period of time
   produces reduced effects. Associative tolerance is best expressed with low doses of opioids
   at long interdose intervals and is readily modified by behavioral or environmental
25 interventions. Nonassociative tolerance is best expressed with high doses of drugs at short
   interdose intervals and is not modified by behavioral or environmental interventions.
            As used herein, the term "opioid tolerant subject" refers to a subject currently
   receiving opioid therapy. In one embodiment, the subject is taking >60 mg oral
   morphine/day or equianalgesic dose of another opioid for 1 week or longer, as specified in
30 the Table 1 below.

   i. Mucoadhesive layer
           In some embodiments, the devices of the present invention adhere to a mucosal
   surface of the subject within about 5 seconds following application. In some embodiments,
20 the devices of the present invention comprise an opioid agonist. In some embodiments, the
   devices of the present invention include a bioerodable- or water-erodable mucoadhesive
   layer, and the opioid agonist is comprised in the mucoadhesive layer. In one embodiment,
   the opioid agonist is buprenorphine. The dose of buprenorphine that can be incorporated into
   the device of the present invention depends on the desired treatment dosage to be
25 administered and can range from about 20 ig to about 20 mg, or from about 120 ig to about
   2000 ig of buprenorphine.
   ii. Backing layer
           In some embodiments, the device further comprises at least one additional non
   adhesive polymeric environment, e.g., a backing layer. This layer is disposed adjacent to the
30 mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion environment, e.g., a backing layer, functions to facilitate
                                                    12

    WO 2013/096811                                                                PCT/US2012/071330
   the delivery of the opioid agonist, such as buprenorphine, to the mucosa. This additional
   layer may comprise the same or a different combination of polymers as the mucoadhesive
   polymeric diffusion environment or the non-adhesive polymeric diffusion environment.
            In some embodiments, the backing layer includes an additional medicament, such as
 5 an opioid antagonist, to render the device of the invention abuse-resistant. In some
   embodiments, the opioid antagonist is naloxone. The dose of naloxone that can be
   incorporated into the backing layer of the device of the present invention can range from
   about 2.5 Lg to about 5 mg of naloxone. In some embodiments, the amount of buprenorphine
   and the amount of naloxone disposed in the device are present in a ratio chosen such that the
10 effect of buprenorphine is negated by naloxone if the mixture is injected or snorted. In some
   embodiments, the amount of buprenorphine and the amount of naloxone disposed in the
   device are present in a 4:1 w/w ratio.
   EXEMPLIFICATION OF THE INVENTION
            The invention will be further understood by the following examples. However, those
15 skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the specific experimental details are only
   illustrative and are not meant to limit the invention as described herein, which is defined by
   the claims which follow thereafter.
   Example 1. Preparation of the devices of the invention
            Transmucosal devices are configured in the form of a disc, rectangular in shape with
20 round corners, yellow on one or both sides of the cheek). Buprenorphine is present in the
   mucoadhesive layer, and this side is to be placed in contact with the buccal mucosa (inside
   the cheek). The drug is delivered into and across the mucosa as the disc erodes in the mouth.
   The non-adhesive, backing layer controls the rate erosion of the disc, and minimizes the
   amount of buprenorphine dissolved in saliva and ultimately swallowed, a pathway of lower
25 absorption due first pass metabolism. The mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion layer and the
   backing layer are bonded together and do not delaminate during or after application.
            The mucoadhesive layer for the transmucosal devices of the present invention
   comprising the desired dosage of buprenorphine is prepared by mixing purified water,
   propylene glycol (about 4.6% total formulation, by dry weight), sodium benzoate (about
30 0.5% total formulation, by dry weight), methylparaben (about 0.9% total formulation, by dry
                                                     13

    WO 2013/096811                                                                 PCT/US2012/071330
   weight), propylparaben (about 0.2% total formulation, by dry weight), vitamin E acetate
   (about 0.06% total formulation, by dry weight), citric acid (about 0.5% total formulation, by
   dry weight), yellow iron oxide (about 0.5% total formulation, by dry weight), monobasic
   sodium phosphate (about 3.4% total formulation, by dry weight). The above ingredients are
 5 added sequentially to a mixing vessel. After the components are dissolved, buprenorphine
   HCl (about 1.3% total formulation, by dry weight) is added, and the vessel was heated to
   120 'F to 130 'F. After dissolution, the polymer mixture (hydroxypropyl cellulose (about
   6.8% total formulation, by dry weight), hydroxyethyl cellulose (about 20.3% total
   formulation, by dry weight), polycarbophil (about 6.3% total formulation, by dry weight),
10 and carboxy methyl cellulose (about 54.3% total formulation, by dry weight)) are added to
   the vessel, and stirred until dispersed. Subsequently, heat is removed from the mixing vessel.
   As the last addition step, tribasic sodium phosphate and sodium hydroxide are added to adjust
   the blend to a desired pH. The blend is mixed under vacuum for a few hours. Each prepared
   mixture is stored in an air-sealed vessel until its use in the coating operation.
15 The backing layer is prepared by adding purified water to a mixing vessel followed by
   sequential addition of sodium benzoate (about 0.5% total formulation, by dry weight),
   methylparaben (about 0.4% total formulation, by dry weight), propylparaben (about 0.1%
   total formulation, by dry weight), citric acid (about 0.5% total formulation, by dry weight),
   vitamin E acetate (about 0.05% total formulation, by dry weight), sodium saccharin (about
20 0.5% total formulation, by dry weight). Subsequently, a mixture of the polymers
   hydroxypropyl cellulose (about 63% total formulation, by dry weight) and hydroxyethyl
   cellulose (about 32% total formulation, by dry weight) are added and stirred at a temperature
   between about 120 'F and 130 'F, until evenly dispersed. Upon cooling to room temperature,
   titanium dioxide (about 2.5% total formulation, by dry weight) and peppermint oil (about
25 0.8% total formulation, by dry weight) are then added to the vessel and stirred. The prepared
   mixture is stored in an air-sealed vessel until it is ready for use in the coating operation.
            The layers are cast in series onto a St. Gobain polyester liner. First, the backing layer
   is cast using a knife-on-a-blade coating method. The backing layer is then cured in a
   continuous oven at about 65 'C to 95 'C and dried. After two coating and drying iterations,
30 an approximately 8 mil (203 to 213 micrometers) thick backing layer is obtained.
   Subsequently, the mucoadhesive polymeric diffusion environment is cast onto the backing
                                                     14

   layer, cured in an oven at about 65 'C to 95 'C and dried. The devices are then die-cut by
   kiss-cut method and removed from the casting surface.
   Example 2. Placebo-controlled, Double-blind Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of BEMA
   Buprenorphine in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Chronic Low Back Pain
 5         A 12-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized withdrawal study was
   conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of buprenorphine delivered twice daily via
   transmucosal drug delivery device with enhanced uptake (BEMA buprenorphine) in subjects
   with moderate to severe chronic low back pain. The study was also designed to define the
   range of BEMA Buprenorphine doses effective for management of moderate to severe
10 chronic lower back pain.
   i. Study Design
           The study consisted of an open-label dose titration period lasting up to 4 weeks,
   followed by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period of 12 weeks.
   The subjects continued on their current pain therapy during the initial screening period (days
15 -14 to -1) and until 12 to 24 hours prior to Day 0/1 of the open-label dose titration period.
   Predose assessments were performed on open-label titration period Day 0 and the first dose
   of study drug was taken on open-label titration period Day 1.
           During the open-label titration period, the subjects were administered BEMA
   Buprenorphine approximately every 12 hours, and dose adjustments were performed at
20 intervals over a period of up to 4 weeks until a stabilized dose was found (i.e., the dose that
   provided meaningful pain relief and was well tolerated). The titration sequence of BEMA
   Buprenorphine is illustrated in the Table 4 below. The subjects for whom a stabilized dose
   could not be found were discontinued from the study.

            The subjects for whom a stabilized dose was identified and who had taken that dose at
   least 12 times over the last 7 days entered a 12-week, double-blind treatment period, in which
   half of subjects received BEMA Placebo and half continued receiving BEMA Buprenorphine
   at the stabilized dose. Each subject's participation in the entire study lasted 19 weeks. The
 5 schematic showing the study design is shown in Figure 1.
   ii. Subject population used in the study
            The subjects who were selected for the inclusion in the study were opioid naive or
   opioid experienced, as defined earlier in this application. Opioid experienced subjects were
   subjects taking <60 mg oral daily dose of morphine or equianalgesic dose of another allowed
10 opioid for 1 week or longer. Opioid naive subjects were not taking any opioids for 1 week or
   longer.
            A total of 334 subjects entered the study, of which 332 subjects entered the 4-week
   open-label dose titration period. As 97 subjects discontinued intervention during the open
   label titration period, a total of 235 subjects continued on to the 12-week double-blind
15 treatment period. Of the 117 subjects who received BEMA Buprenorphine, 28 discontinued
   intervention, and 89 subjects completed the study. Of the 118 subjects who received placebo,
   37 discontinued intervention, and 81 subjects completed the study. Subject disposition
   during the study is summarized in Figure 2, and the characteristics of the population who
   participated in the study are summarized in the Table 5 below:

   iii. Analgesic Efficacy of BEMA Buprenorphine
           Analgesic efficacy was assessed daily by having the subject record their average pain
   intensity over the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 represents no pain and 10
   represents the worst pain imaginable (11-point Numerical Rating Scale, NRS). The mean
 5 change in daily pain intensity from baseline (CBL) to final visit during double blind treatment
   period is presented in Tables 6-12 below. Tables 6-8 present the mean change data for
   different subject groups, and Tables 9-12 present the mean change data for the subject groups
   treated with different doses of buprenorphine.

   pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this
   treatment. The total number of adverse events recorded for both the open label titration and
   double blind treatment periods are listed in the Table 13 below.
