                                                ABSTRACT
An object of the present invention is to provide a squeezable beverage bottle that is relatively
easy to squeeze, provides a desirable flow rate, and exhibits sufficient radial rigidity to resist
damage and/or undesired deformation even after repeated handling and squeezing. Another
object of the present invention is to provide a squeezable beverage bottle used as part of a
bottle mountable filtration system. The present disclosure includes multiple support structures
to adequately secure the filter media within a housing, while ensuring sufficient compression
fit to seal the filter media within the filter assembly and eliminate water leaking past the
filtration system and prevent consumption of unfiltered water.

                                             TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]         The present              disclosure            relates         generally          to    containers
and, in particular,                to     squeezable beverage bottles.                              The present
disclosure        further          relates          generally            to      filtering          systems      for
beverage bottles.
                                                 BACKGROUND
[0002]         Conventional              portable          water        bottles        are     typically        used
to provide        a   thirst-quenching                  liquid        to     a   person.           Such bottles
often include a plastic container having a removable                                                 lid, cover,
cap,   or   other        structure           secured          to     an    opening         of    the     container
to   close    off      the      container.              Water         could       be     obtained         from   the
container       for      drinking           by     squeezing            the      container          and      forcing
the   water     through the              opening.             Such containers                lack      sufficient
elasticity        to    return        to     their original                shape       (or "bounce back")
at    a     suitable             rate          and       without             experiencing                permanent
deformation         or       denting.               Such       containers             ultimately             further
deform     and      degrade           after         repeated            attempts          to      squeeze       such
containers.
[0003]         Conventional               portable          water        bottles         typically           require
the   user    to    proactively              inhale        air      from and          suck      on    an     opening
of   the   bottle         to     facilitate            a     sufficient            flow       to    force      water
through     the      opening          of     the     bottle.              Such      bottles         require      the
user    to  proactively              use       force       on     an     opening         of    the      bottle    to

 [0004]         An object       of one    embodiment       of    the present         disclosure
is    to     provide        a   relatively     inexpensive            squeezable        beverage
bottle     that is        relatively    easy to squeeze,             provides     a desirable
flow     rate,       and    exhibits    sufficient        radial       rigidity      to   resist
damage     and/or undesired deformation                 even after repeated handling
and squeezing.              Another   object    of the       present      disclosure       is  to
provide       a   squeezable      beverage    bottle       used      as  part    of     a bottle
mountable filtration system.
 [0005]         Further,       there   is   no     guarantee        on   the   integrity       or
degree       of       filtering     for    water        obtained        from     conventional
portable        water      bottles.      Conventional          filter      media       materials
such     as,     for    example,     carbon    filters,       easily      break      apart    and
require       special       handling.       Conventional           manufacturing         methods
for filtering           systems    often times       result      in   wasted    filter     media
material.
 [0006]         Therefore,       an  object    of    one embodiment          of the present
disclosure         is   to provide     a relatively         inexpensive       filter      system
for    a   beverage         bottle   that    provides        an     acceptable       degree    of
filtering         of    water    transported       in    the    bottle     and     provides      a
desirable        flow     rate.     Another    object      of   the     present      disclosure
is   to provide          an easy    to manufacture         and      cost-effective        bottle
mountable filtration system.

                                                SUMMARY
 [0007]      Embodiments of          the present disclosure generally provide a
squeezable          beverage       bottle       exhibiting          one      or     more       of   several
desirable characteristics.
 [0008]      In one embodiment, the present disclosure could provide a
relatively         easily      squeezable        beverage        bottle       that      allows      control
of the flow rate of the                  liquid being dispensed to                      the user while
providing           sufficient          radial        rigidity           -     or       resistance           to
squeezing        -    to    return     to  its     original         shape        (or    "bounce      back")
at a suitable             rate without experiencing permanent                           deformation or
denting        and       to   withstand         the       rigors        of     filling,           shipping,
transporting,              dispensing,         repeated          squeezes,            and       subsequent
uses.
 [0009]      In one embodiment, the present disclosure could provide a
squeezable         beverage       bottle       used      as   part       of    a   bottle         mountable
filtration          system.         The    present          disclosure           could       control       the
flow       rate     of      liquid     discharged           from      a    beverage           bottle       and
through       the     bottle     mountable         filtration            system        for     the   liquid
contained in the beverage bottle.
 [0010]      In one embodiment, the present disclosure could provide a
bottle       including        an  elastic        quality       that       aids     in     retaining        its
shape      for aesthetic         and     functional         reasons        (e.g.,       to    sit   upright

or to facilitate future flow of water).
[0011]     In one embodiment, the present disclosure could provide a
relatively        inexpensive            disposable     bottle      or,    alternatively,        a
reusable bottle           for transporting            water    or   other liquids       to   thus
provide       an    environmentally              friendly       option     to    conventional
bottles.
[0012]         Embodiments            of  the present        disclosure     could    provide     a
bottle     mountable         filtration        system     that    delivers     an   acceptable
level of filtration of water transported in the bottle.
[0013]         In      one       embodiment,        the      present     disclosure         could
provide      a   bottle        filter       system.      The     system    could     include     a
filter media having a first end disposed along the proximate end
of a   filter      housing          and   a  second    end disposed        along   the    distal
end  of     the    filter         housing.        The   filter      could    also    include     a
support       structure          disposed      along    an     interior     surface      of    the
proximate       end      of    the      filter    housing.         The   support      structure
could    compress         the      first     end   of   the    filter    media     to    prevent
water   housed        in    the      bottle    from bypassing         the   compressed       seal
between the support structure and the filter media.
[0014]         In      one       embodiment,        the      present     disclosure         could
provide      a   bottle        filter       system.      The     system    could     include     a
filter      housing        removably         mounted      within      a   bottle      having     a
proximate end and a distal end.                      The system could also include a

proximate            end       of     the     filter           housing.            The    support           structure
could be           further          disposed         along       a   bottom        surface        of   a   discharge
mechanism             of       the      bottle.               The     support          structure            could        be
configured             to     cut     into     the       first       end     of     the   filter         media       when
the     filter          media        is    in     an     engaged         position         within         the     filter

                                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 [0050]        The         present            disclosure           generally          provides             a    beverage
bottle           that,           while           being       squeezable,             also        has         sufficient
rigidity            and        elasticity             to   return         to      its     original            shape    (or
"bounce back")                  at      a suitable         rate without experiencing permanent
deformation                 or        denting.               In      one      embodiment,               the      present
disclosure               could         provide        a   squeezable            beverage         bottle          used   as
part        of    a     bottle          mountable         filtration             system.          As      an    example,
the present disclosure                            could be particularly                   suitable for use in
a    bottle        mountable              filtration          system       such      as     those       disclosed       in
U.S.       Patent Nos.               6,569,329 and 5,609,759.
 [0051]              In      another            aspect,        the      present        disclosure              generally
provides               a       relatively              inexpensive               filtration               system       for
disposable                bottles             or,     alternatively,                reusable            bottles        for
transporting                   water           or     other        liquids          to       thus         provide       an
environmentally                     friendly          option         to   conventional              bottled         water
systems.                  In      one        embodiment,             the     present           disclosure           could
include          a     support           system       to   adequately             secure       the      filter      media
within         a    filter          housing          while     ensuring          a  sufficient             compression
fit      and     seal         of     filter         media     within       filter        system         to     eliminate
"bypass          flow"          (i.e.,         water     that      might        leak     past      filter         system)
and prevent consumption of unfiltered water.

[0052]       In    one    embodiment,         the    present    disclosure            could     be
particularly       suitable     for   use     in   a bottle     mountable          filtration
system such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.                             6,569,329 and
5,609,759.           Although       the      following        description            generally
describes    a filter      system for use with a "squeezable"                      bottle,      it
should be      understood      that    embodiments        of   the    filter        system      of
the  present      disclosure      could      be   used   with     any    suitably          sized,
shaped,     or     configured       bottle,        container,       or      container-like
receptacle     including,      for    example,       rigid bottles         and     containers
that are not       squeezable.        FIGURES       1A-2C   are somewhat           simplified
plan   views    of    a  relatively       small      reusable     squeezable           beverage
bottle     100      according       to      one     embodiment        of        the      present
disclosure.           FIGURE     3A    is     a    somewhat      simplified            exploded
perspective      view    of bottle      100,      while   FIGURE      3B     is   a    somewhat
simplified      perspective       view       of   bottle      100   according            to    one
embodiment     of    the   present     disclosure.         It   should be          understood
that   bottle      100   shown    in    FIGURES       1A-3B    are     for      illustrative
purposes only and that any other bottle or bottle-like system or
subsystem could be used in conjunction with or in lieu of bottle
100 according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.
[0053]       In    addition,      FIGURES        1A-3B    illustrate           a   relatively
small    bottle      100    (e.g.,     375     mL    bottle),      and      FIGURES          4A-6B
similarly illustrate a relatively medium-sized bottle 400                                   (e.g.,
550  mL   bottle)       having    similar        characteristics          to     bottle       100.

mold,      creating     pressure         which pushes            the   tubular plastic        stream
outward      along     the    contour       of     the    inside      of   the    mold.     In   this
manner,      the    plastic       stream      is    shaped        and   cooled to produce          the
desired       plastic       container        for      bottles        100,    400,   or   700.       In
addition,        elongated        body      102     could       include      a   smooth    exterior
surface       to    allow      adhesive          labels        to    adhere     sufficiently        or

and 700.
 [0065]         In    one    embodiment,           elongated         body     102  could     aid    in
handling       bottles        100,       400,      and     700.         For    example,      concave
portion       104     could     be     relatively           easily       squeezed     by   hand     to
facilitate        the flow of          liquid out of bottles 100,                  400,    and 700.
Elongated body 102 could exhibit a favorable rate of deformation
and     return     to   its    original        shape       (i.e.,      "breathability")         after
one uses bottles 100,                400, and 700.              As an example, if one were
to     squeeze     bottle      100       (e.g.,      generally         in   the   area   including
concave       portion       104)     to    facilitate           the    flow    of   liquid     to   an
opening of bottle             100    via     discharge          tube    122,   bottle    100    could

118      available        to the contents                of bottles          100,   400,      and 700        could
affect         the   filtering           capability            of   bottles       100,      400,      and       700.
Filter          system         118      could        include          an      outside         surface           area
 (including         the      outside       diameter          and    the bottom          of    filter       system
118)       of   about      7.44    square        inches         and   an    open    area       (having       slots
in      the     housing        of   filter         system)         of    about     2.50      square        inches
according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.
 [0075]           Filter        system        118     could        include       any      suitable         filter
media         120    including,            for      example,          a     carbon,        active        carbon,
charcoal,          reverse        osmosis,          distiller,           backwash,         other       suitable
filter,         or   any      combination           thereof.           In     one   embodiment,            filter
media        120    could       include        one      or     more    carbon       cartridges          having,
for      example,         a   height       of     about        3.10     inches      and     a     diameter         of
about         0.730     inches.            Both      the       height       and   diameter           of    filter

media     120     could    include       any   reasonable        range      of tolerance.           It
has     been     observed,        however,       that    the    range       of     tolerances      for
filter media 120 could be as much as 1/8 of an inch or more.                                        In
one embodiment,           however,       the diameter          of   filter       media     120  could
include      a    tolerance       of   about     ±0.010      inches      while      the   length    of
filter      media       120    could      include       a   tolerance          of    about     ±0.015
inches.
 [0076]          In one embodiment, filter media 120 could have a water
flow rate within            a certain        range     to achieve          desired performance
criteria.           Once    water     is   discharged         through       filter      system     118
and discharge          mechanism        116,    the air       returning        into bottle must
pass     through        this     same     filter      media      120.         Accordingly,         the
return         airflow         could       essentially            provide           cleansing       or
backwashing          function       that    prolongs        the    usable        life     of   filter
system        118      according         to      one     embodiment           of      the    present
disclosure.           Similarly,          any       residual         liquid         remaining       in
discharge        mechanism        116    may   return      into    a     corresponding         bottle
through      filter      media     120    and provide         a cleansing          or backwashing
function.
 [0077]          According       to one embodiment            of the present disclosure,
filter      media     120    could     be   secured       or   otherwise         disposed      within
the filter housing of filter system 118 by supporting structures
associated          with  filter       system      118    and   discharge          mechanism     116.
For     example,        a   proximate        end     of    filter       media       120    could    be
