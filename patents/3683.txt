types of MHV configurations, including for example, orderpickers, swing reach vehicles, and
any other lift vehicles. The various embodiments disclosed herein are suitable for both driver
controlled, pedestrian controlled and remotely controlled MHVs.
[0017]        Fig. 1 shows one non-limiting example of a MHV 100 in the form of a reach truck
according to the present disclosure. The MHV 100 can include one or more forks 102 that are
attached to a telescoping mast 104. The forks 102 may be raised and lowered by the telescoping
mast 104, which can be attached to an operator compartment 106 that includes a power supply
 108.  The MHV 100 can include a traction wheel 110 configured to enable the MHV 100 to
travel. In some non-limiting examples, the operator compartment 106 can include a seat for an
operator, and an operating console to guide the MHV 100 and control the operation thereof. The
operating console can include but is not limited to controls for steering, speed, and positioning
the forks 102 on the MHV 100. It is to be appreciated that alternative embodiments of the MHV
100 may include a platform coupled to the telescoping mast 104 where the operator stands in the
operator platform.
[0018]       With reference to Figs. 1-3, the MHV 100 can include a first base leg 112 and a
second base leg 114. The first and second base legs 112 and 114 can extend outwardly away
from the operator compartment 106 and define a lateral gap therebetween. In some non-limiting
examples, the lateral gap between the first and second base legs 112 and 114 can be dimension to
accommodate the forks 102. In some non-limiting examples, the first and second base legs 112
and 114 can provide structural support for the front end of the MHV 100. For example, the first
and second base legs 112 and 114 at least partially support the telescoping mast 104 as the forks
 102 are raised and lowered thereby.
[0019]        Each of the first base leg 112 and the second base leg 114 can include a wheel mount
 116 configured to receive one or more load wheels 118 therein. In some non-limiting examples,
the load wheels 118 may swivel within the wheel mounts 116. In some non-limiting examples,
the MHV 100 can comprise a rack sensor 120 arranged on at least one of the first base leg 112
and the second base leg 114. The illustrated MHV 100 can include a rack sensor 120 arranged
on each of the first base leg 112 and the second base leg 114 (i.e., the first base leg 112 can
include a first rack sensor 120 and the second base leg 114 can include a second rack sensor
 120). In other non-limiting configurations, the MHV 100 may include a plurality of rack sensors
 120 arranged along each of the first base leg 112 and the second base leg 114.          This may

facilitate sequentially indicating to an operator that the MHV 100 is reaching a desired position
relative to a racking structure 128. The rack sensors 120 can be arranged at a predetermined
distance 132 from a front face 130 defined by the mast 104. In some non-limiting examples, the
front face 130 of the mast 104 can be a face of the mast 104 arranged closest to the racking
structure 128, when the MHV 100 is manipulating a load on the racking structure 128. In some
non-limiting examples, the predetermined distance 132 can be dimensioned to properly position
the forks 102, which are movable coupled to the mast 104, relative to the racking structure 128 to
ensure that a load is accurately placed thereon. The rack sensors 120 can be configured to detect
a racking feature 136 on the racking structure 128, as will be described in detail below.
[0020]       The MHV 100 can include a controller 122 in communication with the rack sensors
120, an indication device 124, and a network 126. In other embodiments, the controller 122 can
be in communication with the indication device 124 over the network 126. The controller 122
can be configured to communicate wirelessly with the indication device 124 and the network 126
using WiFi, Bluetooth@, or any other wireless communication method known in the art or
developed in the future.      Alternatively or additionally, the controller 122 may be in wired
communication with the indication device 124 and the network 126.            In some non-limiting
configurations, the rack sensors 120 may interface through a warehouse management system.
[0021]       In one non-limiting example, the indication device 124 can be in the form of an LED
light on control panel within the operator compartment 106 that can be triggered when the rack
sensors 120 detects a racking feature or may progressively illuminate as the MHV 100
approaches the racking structure 128. In other embodiments, the indication device 124 may be
in the form of other visual indicators, audible indicators, a plugging function, stopping a reach
function, or other indication devices known in the art.
[0022]       Operation of the MHV 100 when manipulating a load 138 on a racking structure 128
will be described with reference to Figs. 3-5.       The racking feature 136 can be one or more
structural elements of the racking structure 128, such as columns, shelving, and cross-members,
as shown in Figs. 3 and 4.       In other embodiments, the racking feature 136 can be a target
positioned on the racking structure 128 to provide indication to the operator that the MHV 100 is
located at a predetermined distance 132 from the racking structure.
[0023]       During operation, the MHV 100 can approach the racking structure 128 with a load
 138 arranged on the forks 102 at step 140. As the MHV 100 approaches the racking structure
                                                 -15

 128, the rack sensors 120 can acquire data at step 142. In one non-limiting configuration, the
rack sensors 120 may operate using a time of flight principle, where the rack sensors 120 sends a
pulse toward the racking structure 128 to detect the racking feature 136. In other non-limiting
configurations, the rack sensors 120 may comprise a multiple frequency phase-shift sensor,
interferometry devices, a magnetic sensor, an optical sensor, or other detection sensors known in
the art. At step 142, the rack sensors 120 may acquire data continuously or discretely (i.e.,
acquire data in predefined increments). Alternatively or additionally, at step 142, a proximity
sensor coupled to the MHV 100 may detect the racking structure 128 and trigger the rack sensors
120 to begin acquiring data.
[0024]       With the rack sensors 120 acquiring data at step 142, the controller 122 can monitor
the data acquired by the rack sensors 120 and determine at step 148 if the rack sensors 120 detect
a racking feature 136 of the racking structure 128. If a racking feature 136 is not detected at step
148, the rack sensors 120 can continue to acquire data at step 142. If a racking feature 136 is
detected at step 148, the indication device 124 can provide an indication to the operator of the
MHV 100 at step 150.       As described above, the rack sensors 120 can be arranged such that the
predetermined distancel32 exists between the front face 130 of the mast 104 and the rack
sensors 120. Thus, when the rack sensors 120 detect a racking feature 136 and subsequently an
indication to the operator is provided by the indication device 124, the predetermined
distance 132 can exist between the front face 130 of the mast 104 and the racking structure 128.
The predetermined distancel32 can be defined to ensure that the load 138 is positioned as
desired when placed on the racking structure 128.          That is, the rack sensors 120 can aid
placement of the load 138 relative to the racking feature 136. For example, a width dimension of
the load 138 (i.e., a dimension from left to right from the perspective of Fig. 3) can be known, or
communicated to the controller 122 by a warehouse management system. The predetermined
distancel32 can be sized to ensure that when the rack sensor 120 detects a racking feature 136,
the forks 102 position the load 138 on the racking structure 128 so that the load 138 does not
protrude from the racking structure 128. That is, the load 138 may be arranged in between the
front and rear faces (left and right faces from the perspective of Fig. 3) of the racking structure
 128.   Thus, the rack sensor 120 can ensure that the MHV 100 accurately places loads on a
racking structure.

Attorney Docket No. 780139.00879
[0025]       Alternatively or additionally, if a racking feature 136 is detected at step 148, it can be
determined if the MHV 100 is square to the racking structure 128 at step 144. That is, the rack
sensors 120 can cooperate to detennine a rotational orientation of the MHV 100 with respect to
the racking structure 128. In other words, the rack sensors 120 can cooperate to detect if the
front face 130 of the mast 104 can be substantially parallel to the racking structure 128. As
described above, in some non-limiting examples, the first base leg 112 and the second base leg
 114 can each include a rack sensor 120. Thus, it can be determined at step 144 if both of the
rack sensors 120 detect a racking feature 136 within a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 0.1
seconds, 0.5 seconds, 1.0 seconds, etc.). If so, it can be determined that the MHV 100 can be
square to the racking structure 128 at step 144 and, subsequently, an indication can be provided
to the operator by the indication device 124 indicating the same at step 146. If not, it can be
determined that the MHV 100 can be arranged askew with respect to the racking structure 128
and an indication can be provided to the operator by the indication device 124 indicating the
same at step 146. Thus, in addition to ensuring that a load is accurately placed on a racking
structure, the rack sensors 120 also enable the MHV 100 to rotationally align the load onto the
racking structure.
[0026]       It should be appreciated that the use of the term "rack" herein is not meant to be
limiting in any way, and the MHVs described herein are capable of interfacing with alternative
storage structures, as would be appreciated by one of skill in the art.
[0027]       Within this specification embodiments have been described in a way which enables a
clear and concise specification to be written, but it is intended and will be appreciated that
embodiments may be variously combined or separated without parting from the invention. For
example, it will be appreciated that all preferred features described herein are applicable to all
aspects of the invention described herein.
