BURNER TUBE FOR GAS GRILL
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] This application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application
No. <removed-apn>, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
FIELD
[0002] The present inventions relate to burners for use in gas appliances such as gas grills. More
particularly, the present inventions relate to tapered burner tubes having raised gas ports and a
smooth interior surface.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003] Burners and burner tube assemblies, including those used in gas grills, are well known.
Most conventional gas grills include burner tube assemblies that provide a plurality of burner
tubes, gas valves and a gas distribution manifold. Each burner tube has a length defined by an
open end and a closed end and a plurality of outlet ports along the length of the burner tube
between the open and closed ends. The open end of the burner tube typically includes an air
shutter that it used to adjust the gas and combustion air mixture, as well as a venturi region to
increase the velocity of the gas/air mixture in the tube. The open end is connected to the neck of
a gas control valve, which is in fluid communication with a gas distribution manifold, which is
in fluid communication with a gas source such as a tank.
[0004] For cost, manufacturing and other reasons, many conventional burner tubes are
constructed from hollow welded circular tubing, often made from stainless steel. A venturi
region is typically formed by pinching the tube near the open end of the burner tube. The venturi
increases the velocity of the fuel/air mixture from the gas nozzle into the burner tube. An air
shutter is also typically provided on the open end of the burner tube to adjust the fuel to air
mixture.
[0005] Also for cost and other manufacturing reasons, the gas ports of typical burner tubes are
punched into the tube from the outside of the tube to the inside, either on the top or sides of the
tube. This results in burrs or other obstructions on the inside of the burner tube that can disrupt

                                                   2
the flow of the fuel/air mixture and provide poor flame quality. Moreover, the flames produced
by those burner tubes typically sit directly on the surface of the burner tube itself. This increases
the temperature of the burner tube and can result in increased corrosion and clogging of the
ports as well as a shorter life of the burner tube. In addition, many known burner tubes have a
substantially uniform cross-section along their length that can result in uneven or inconsistent
fuel pressure along the length of the tube. This can also negatively affect flame quality.
[0006] Thus, there is a need for improved burner tubes that provide improved flame
characteristics and quality and which increase the life of the burner tube. There is also a need for
burner tubes that enable smooth fuel/air flow throughout their length, as well as consistent
pressure throughout the length of the burner tube.
[0007] There is desire for a safe, reliable burner tube that efficiently operates over a wide range
of gases and mixtures and a wide range of input pressures.
[0008] There is another desire for a tapered burner tube that enables consistent pressure along
the length of the tube.
[0009] There is another desire for a burner tube having a smooth interior surface that enables
laminar fluid flow along the length of the interior of the tube.
[0010] There is another desire for raised gas ports that enable better flame characteristics and
help maintain a cooler burner tube temperature.
[0011] There is another desire to manufacture the burner tube by forming the raised gas ports
from what will be the inside of the burner tube to what will be the outside of the burner tube so
that the interior of the burner tube is smooth and free from burrs of other obstructions.
[0012] There is another desire to reduce corrosion and gas port clogging of the burner tube.
[0013] There is another desire for larger gas port openings that provide improved flame
characteristics and are less susceptible to corrosion, yet are not prone to backflash or flame pull
back into the burner tube when in use.

                                                  3
[0014] There is another desire to enable greater material selection as well as manufacturing and
cost advantages.
[0015] There is another desire for a burner tube having improved flame characteristics and less
material degradation.
[0016] There is another desire for an improved venturi member and including one that functions
with a burner tube having a non-circular cross-section.
[0017] There is another desire for an improved burner tube having a tapered cross-section, a
venturi member and an air shutter that cooperates with the open end of the burner tube to adjust
the fuel/air mixture.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0042] Set forth below is a description of what is currently believed to be the preferred
embodiments or best representative examples of the inventions claimed. Future and present
alternatives and modifications to the embodiments and preferred embodiments are

                                                     7
contemplated. Any alternatives or modifications which make insubstantial changes in function,
purpose, structure or result are intended to be covered by the claims of this patent.
[0043] The overall aspects of a burner assembly 10 of the present inventions may be seen by
reference to Figures 1 and 2. Burner assembly 10 includes a preferred burner tube 20, an air
shutter 50 and a venturi member 60. Burner tube 20 has a length between an open end 21 and a
closed end 22. Open end 21 is typically toward the front of the grill adjacent to a gas valve and
gas distribution manifold (not shown) and the closed end 22 is typically secured to the rear of a
grill. In most situations, a grill will include a plurality of burner tubes 20 spaced parallel to each
other.
[0044] In a preferred embodiment, burner tube 20 has a rectangular cross-sectional shape, with
an upper surface 23, two side surfaces 24, 25 and a bottom surface 26 forming a substantially
hollow interior. It will be understood by those of skill in the art that the cross-sectional shape of
burner tube 20 does not have to be rectangular, as in the preferred embodiment. For example,
the cross-sectional shape may be square, circular or oval. In the preferred embodiment, the
burner tube 20 is tapered, i.e., there is a gradual decrease in cross-sectional area along the length
from the open end 21 to the closed end 22. This permits a constant pressure of the fuel/air
mixture throughout the length of the burner tube 20. A window 28 is provided on each side 24,
25 near the open end 21 of burner tube 20. The window 28, in conjunction with air shutter 50
(Figure 9), is used to adjust the air/fuel mixture as will be understood by those of skill in the art.
[0045] A plurality of gas ports 30 are also provided. In a preferred embodiment, gas ports 30 are
equally spread along the top surface 23 of the burner tube 20. It will be understood by those of
skill in the art that the number and spacing of ports, as well as the size of the cross-sectional
shape of burner tube 20, is calculated or determined based upon the BTU's desired from each
burner tube 20. Importantly, the gas ports 30 are formed or extruded from the inside of tube 20
to the outside of tube 20. In this manner, unlike conventional burner tubes which are punched
from the outside to the inside of the tube, there are no burrs or obstructions on the inside of the
burner tube 20 to obstruct the fuel/air flow or to make that flow turbulent. As a result, desirable
blue flame characteristics, among other advantages, are achieved.
[0046] In the preferred embodiment and preferred method of its manufacture, burner tube 20 is
constructed from a single sheet of appropriately sized and shaped material, typically stainless

                                                   8
steel. On what will become the inside of burner tube 20, gas ports 30 are formed or extruded on
what will be the top surface 23. Once the ports 30 are formed from the inside to the outside, the
sheet of material is then folded to form the upper 23 and side surfaces 24, 25, as well as bottom
surface 26. A tab 27 is provided and welded together so that a substantially hollow, tapered and
burr-free burner tube 20 is formed. See Figures 1, 2, 3 and 5. It will be understood by those of
skill in the art that there are methods, other than the preferred method, of manufacturing tapered
burner tube 20 and ports 30 consistent with the goals and objects of the present inventions.
[0047] The preferred raised gas ports 30 of the present inventions may better be seen by
reference to Figures 6 and 7. Each port 30 has a height 32 measured from the upper surface 23
with an opening 33 at the top of the height 32. Each opening 33 has a diameter 34. In the
preferred embodiment, the openings 33 are circular. It will be understood by those of skill in the
art that openings 33 may be another shape and that the dimensions discussed herein for diameter
may be readily converted to area if, for example, square or rectangular openings are used.
Because the opening 33 of port 30 is raised above upper surface 23 of burner tube 20, the flame
is also lifted above upper surface 23 of burner tube 20. This improves flame quality and reduces
the temperature of tube 20 during grilling, which increases the life of the tube 20 and prevents
corrosion and clogging of the port openings 33. It will be understood by those of skill in the art
that ports 30 may alternatively be located on one or both side surfaces 24, 25. It will also be
understood that non-rectangular shapes of burner tube 20 may also be used consistent with the
present inventions.
[0048] Tests have shown that the ratio of port height 32 to port opening 33 diameter 34 is
important to proper and efficient flame quality and burner tube 20 longevity. The ideal
theoretical port height 32 to port opening 33 diameter 34 is 1:1. However, in practice, that ratio
is unobtainable when cost effectively manufacturing a burner tube 20 of the present inventions.
Since the ports 30 are formed from the material of upper surface 23, there is only so much
material available to form the ports 30, as will be understood by those of skill in the art. In
addition, tests have also shown that in burner tubes 20 sized for use in typical gas grills, the port
opening 33 diameter 34 should not exceed .110" to avoid flame pullback into burner tube 20.
Thus, it has been determined that the maximum, reasonably feasible port height 32 is
approximately .020" to .062". And, the preferred port opening 33 diameter 34 is between
approximately .075" and .110". In the preferred embodiment, the port height 32 to opening
diameter 34 ratio is approximately .645. This preferred ratio is achieved using a preferred port

                                                   9
height 32 of .060" and a preferred port opening diameter 34 of .093". This preferred
configuration, along with the taper of burner tube 20, provides the best flame quality, reduces
clogging and extends the life of the burner tube 20.
[0049] A preferred venturi member 60 may be seen by reference to Figure 8. Venturi member
60 includes a front face 61 having an opening 62 to accommodate the neck of a typical gas valve
(not shown). A rearwardly projecting side tab 63 having a hole 64 is also provided on each side
of front face 61. A top flange 65 and a bottom flange 66 project rearward of face 61. Top flange
65 includes a v-shaped portion having an apex 67. Similarly, bottom flange 66 includes an
inverted v-shaped portion having an apex 68. As can be seen in Figure 8, the space between the
top and bottom flanges 65 and 66 becomes constricted where the two opposing apexes 67 and
68 meet. A stabilizer brace 69 is provided at the rear of the member to support the upper and
lower flanges 65 and 66. A hole 70 may be provided on upper flange 65 near the front in order
to accommodate a screw used to secure air shutter 50 to the burner tube 20 (see Figures 2 and
9), as hereinafter described.
[0050] As shown in Figures 1 and 2, venturi member 60 is inserted into the open end 21 of
burner tube 20. It may be affixed to the burner tube 20 using a screw (not shown) through hole
64 of tab 63 into holes 71 in the sides 24, 25 of burner tube 20. It will be understood that other
means may be used to attach venturi member 60 to burner tube 20.
[0051] When inserted into burner tube 20, the neck of a typical gas valve (not shown) is inserted
into opening 62. As the fuel/air mixture passes between the space between upper apex 67 and
lower apex 68, it velocity is increased. It will be understood by those of skill in the art that
venturi member 60 is shaped and sized to fit within the open end 21 and coincides with the
cross-sectional shape of burner tube 20.
[0052] A preferred air shutter 50 of the present inventions may be seen by reference to Figure 9.
As will be understood by those of skill in the art, air shutter 50 cooperates with the window 28
at the open end 21 of burner tube 20 to permit adjustment of the combustion air to fuel mixture.
Preferred shutter 50 includes a top 51 having a slot 52 which is used to secure shutter 50 through
hole 72 to burner tube 20 once in the proper position for the desired mixture. Shutter 50 includes
two sides 53, each having a recess 54 and two bottom sections 55. It will be understood by those
of skill in the art that a space between bottom members 55 is provided to accommodate tab 27

                                                  10
on the bottom of burner tube 20 that is part of a preferred manufacturing process. The recesses
54 of sides 53 accommodate the attachment flanges 63 of venturi member 60 when it is attached
to burner tube 20.
[0053] When in use, the neck of a gas valve is inserted into opening 62 of venturi member 60
with the open end of burner tube 20 typically at the front of the grill. The closed end 22 of
burner tube 20 is movably secured to a rear of the grill and the open end slidingly connected to
the valve neck by the air shutter 50. In this manner, tube 20 may expand and contract as
necessary during use. The gas is injected into venturi member 60 and mixed with the desired
amount of combustion air using air shutter 50. The velocity of the fuel/air mixture is accelerated
by the venturi member 60 and flows down the length of burner tube 20. Because of the taper of
burner tube 20, the pressure throughout the length of the tube 20 is relatively constant.
[0054] When lit, the flame sits on top of the raised gas ports 30 at the opening 33. Since the
flame is lifted off of the upper surface 23 of burner tube 20, the burner tube 20 remains cooler.
This results in less port 30 clogging and less corrosion of the burner tube 20. In this manner, a
longer life of burner tube 20 and high flame quality may be achieved. In addition, when the
preferred port height 32 to port opening 33 diameter 34 is used, flame quality is further
increased.
[0055] The above description is not intended to limit the meaning of the words used in or the
scope of the following claims that define the invention. Rather, it is contemplated that future
modifications in structure, function or result will exist that are not substantial changes and that
all such insubstantial changes in what is claimed are intended to be covered by the claims. Thus,
while preferred embodiments of the present inventions have been illustrated and described, it
will be understood that changes and modifications can be made without departing from the
claimed invention. In addition, although the term "claimed invention" or "present invention" is
sometimes used herein in the singular, it will be understood that there are a plurality of
inventions as described and claimed.
