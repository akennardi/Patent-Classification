FIELD OF THE INVENTION
             [0003]The present invention generally relates to a moment resisting, beam-to
column joint connection structure.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
             [0004] It has been found in a moment-resisting building having a structural steel
framework, that most of the energy of an earthquake, or other extreme loading
condition, is absorbed and dissipated, in or near the beam-to-column joints of the
building.
             [0005] In the structural steel construction of moment-resisting buildings, towers,
and similar structures, most commonly in the past, the flanges of beams were welded to
the face of columns by full-penetration, single bevel, groove welds. Thus, the joint
connection was comprised of highly-restrained welds connecting a beam between
successive columns. Vertical loads, that is, the weight of the floors and loads
superimposed on the floors, were and still are assumed by many to be carried by
vertical shear tabs or pairs of vertical, structural angle irons arranged back-to-back,
bolted or welded to the web of the beam and bolted or welded to the face of the
column.
             [0006]The greater part of the vertical load placed upon a beam was commonly
assumed to be carried by a shear tab bolted or welded to the web of the beam and
bolted or welded to the face of the flange of the column at each end of the beam.
                                                    1
9841453_1 (GHMatters) P99909.AU.2

Through the use of face-to-face gusset plates welded to the column, the greater part of
the vertical load is carried by the gusset plates.
             [0007] Experience has shown that the practice of welding the beam's flanges
directly to the column is uncertain and/or unsuitable for resistance to earthquakes,
explosions, tornadoes and other disastrous events. Such connection means and
welding practice has resulted in sudden, fractured welds, the pulling of divots from the
face of the column flange, cracks in the column flange and column web, and various
other failures. Such highly-restrained welds do not provide a reliable mechanism for
dissipation of earthquake energy, or other large forces, and can lead to brittle fracture
of the weld and the column, particularly the flange of the column and the web of the
column in the locality of the beam-to-column joint, (known as the "panel zone").
             [0008] It is desirable to achieve greater strength, ductility and joint rotational
capacity in beam-to-column connections in order to make buildings less vulnerable to
disastrous events. Greater connection strength, ductility and joint rotational capacity
are particularly desirable in resisting sizeable moments in both the lateral and the
vertical plane. That is, the beam-to-column moment-resisting connections in a steel
frame building can be subjected to large rotational demands in the vertical plane due to
interstory lateral building drift. Engineering analysis, design and full-scale specimen
testing have determined that prior steel frame connection techniques can be
substantially improved by strengthening the beam-to-column connection in a way which
better resists and withstands the sizeable beam-to-column, joint rotations which are
placed upon the beam and the column. That is, the beam-to-column connection must
be a strong and ductile, moment-resisting connection.
             [0009] Reference is made to co-assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,660,017, 6,138,427,
6,516,583, and 8,205,408 (Houghton et al.) for further discussion of prior practice and
the improvement of the structural connection between beams and columns through the
use of gusset plates. These patents illustrate the improvements that have been
manifested commercially in the construction industry by Houghton and others in side
plate technology. Initially, side plate construction was introduced to greatly improve the
quality of the beam-to-column connection. Further improvements included the
provision of side plate technology using full length beams to achieve greater economy
and to facilitate more conventional erection techniques.

SUMMARY
             [0010] The invention provides a prefabricated full-length beam assembly
comprising:
             a full-length beam including top and bottom flanges; and
             a first connecting member attached to the top flange of the full-length beam; and
             bolt holes in the first connecting member arranged for receiving bolts to connect
             the full-length beam to a prefabricated column assembly.
             [0011] In one aspect, a joint connection structure of a building framework
generally comprises a column assembly including a column and a pair of gusset plates
connected to the column on opposite sides of the column and extending laterally
outward from the column. A full-length beam assembly includes a full-length beam
having upper and lower flanges and an end portion received between the gusset plates.
A connecting member is operatively attached by welding to at least one of said flanges
of the full-length beam. The connecting member is bolted to at least one of the gusset
plates of the column assembly to connect the full-length beam assembly to the column
assembly.
             [0012] In another aspect, a prefabricated column assembly generally comprises
a column. A pair of gusset plates are connected to the column on opposite sides of the
column and extend laterally outward from the column. A connecting member is welded
to an outer surface of at least one of the gusset plates. Bolt holes are associated with
the gusset plates and connecting member for receiving bolts to connect the
prefabricated column assembly to a prefabricated beam assembly generally between
the pair of gusset plates during erection of a building framework.
             [0013] In still another aspect, a prefabricated column assembly generally
comprises a column. Gusset plates are connected to the column on opposite sides of
the column and extend laterally outward from the column. A connecting member is
attached to one of the gusset plates. A first plurality of bolt holes are disposed in the
connecting member and a second plurality of bolt holes are disposed in said one gusset
plate. Each of the first bolt holes has a bolt receiving axis extending generally along a
length of the column and each of the second bolt holes has a bolt receiving axis
extending transverse to the length of the column. The bolt holes are configured to
connect the prefabricated column assembly to a beam assembly.
             [0014] In yet another aspect, a prefabricated full-length beam assembly generally
comprises a full-length beam including top and bottom flanges. Slotted bolt holes are
                                                    3

associated with at least one of the top and bottom flanges of the full-length beam for
receiving bolts positioned to connect the prefabricated full-length beam assembly to
gusset plates of a prefabricated column assembly during erection of a building
framework. The slotted bolt holes are slotted generally perpendicular to a longitudinal
axis of the full-length beam such that a dimension of each bolt hole extending generally
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the full-length beam is greater than a dimension
of each bolt hole extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of the full-length beam. The
prefabricated full-length beam assembly is free of connection to a column prior to
erection of the building framework.
             [0015] In still yet another aspect, a joint connection structure of a building
framework generally comprises a column assembly including a column and a pair of
gusset plates connected to the column on opposite sides of the column and extending
laterally outward from the column. A beam assembly includes a beam having upper
and lower flanges and an end portion received between the gusset plates. A first
plurality of bolts connects the upper flange of the beam to the column assembly and a
second plurality of bolts connects the lower flange of the beam to the column assembly.
Each of the first bolts have a bolt receiving axis extending transverse to a length of the
beam member and generally along a length of the column and each of the second bolts
have a bolt receiving axis extending transverse to the length of the beam and
transverse to the length of the column.
             [0016] In yet still another aspect, a joint connection structure of a building
framework generally comprises a column assembly including a column and a gusset
plate assembly including a pair of gusset plates connected to the column on opposite
sides of the column and extending laterally outward from the column. A full-length
beam assembly includes a full-length beam having an end portion. A connecting
member is operatively attached by welding to an axially facing end of the full-length
beam. The connecting member is bolted to the gusset plate assembly of the column
assembly to connect the full-length beam assembly to the column assembly.
             [0017] In another aspect, a prefabricated column assembly generally comprises
a column. A pair of gusset plates extend laterally outward from the column. Bolts
attach the gusset plates to the column on opposite sides of the column.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
             [00163]              Referring to Figs. 1-12, a beam-to-column moment-resisting joint
connection structure of a first embodiment is generally indicated at 11. The joint
connection structure may be used in the construction of a building framework F (see
Fig. 1A). In the illustrated embodiment, the joint connection structure joins a column
assembly 13 including a column 15 to a full-length beam assembly 17 including a full
length beam 19. A full-length beam is a beam that has a length sufficient to extend
substantially the full-length between adjacent columns in a structure. Thus, a stub and
link beam assembly as shown in Figs. 5 and 16 of U.S. Patent No. 6,138,427, herein
incorporated by reference, is not a full-length beam. It is understood that the joint
connection structure may be a beam-to-column type as shown, or a beam-to-column-to
beam type as shown in U.S. Patent No. 8,146,322, herein incorporated by reference,
depending upon the location of the joint connection structure within a building's
framework.
             [00164]              The beam 19 and column 15 may have any suitable configuration,
such as an I-beam, H-beam configuration, or hollow rectangular shape (built up box
member or HSS tube section). A spaced apart pair of parallel, vertically and
horizontally extending gusset plates 21 sandwich the column 15 and beam 19. Four
                                                             11
9841453_1 (GHMatters) P99909.AU.2

optional horizontal shear plates 23 (only three are shown in Fig. 1) are arranged in
vertically spaced pairs generally aligned at top and bottom edges of the gusset plates
21. A horizontal cover plate 27 is disposed on top of an end of the beam 19. The cover
plate 27 is attached in a suitable manner such as by weld 29 to the upper flange of the
beam 19. The cover plate 27 may have a width that is greater than a width of the
beam 19 and a horizontal spacing of the gusset plates 21. The configuration of the
cover plate 27 allows the beam 19 to be lowered between the gusset plates 21 so that
one end of the full-length beam assembly 17 is initially supported in bearing between
the cover plate 27 and the top edge of the horizontal extension of the gusset plates 21
of the column assembly 13. In other words, the beam 19 is self-shoring. Preferably,
the cover plate 27 may rest on a top face of a projecting horizontal leg of upper angle
irons 31 which will be explained in greater detail below. The cover plate 27 extends
along the length of the beam 19 and terminates generally at the ends of the gusset
plates 21. The cover plate 27 has an oblong radiused slot opening 30 extending along
the length of the cover plate. It will be understood that the cover plate 27 may have
other widths, configurations and slot-type oblong openings. For example, a cover plate
(not shown) may extend beyond the ends of the gusset plates 21 and/or have no slot
opening 30.
             [00165]              Referring to Figs. 1-8, each gusset plate 21 has an upper angle iron
31 (broadly, "an upper connecting member") attached to an outer surface of the gusset
plate. The upper angle iron 31 comprises an elongate L-shaped member including a
vertical first leg attached to the outer surface of the gusset plate 21 at an upper portion
of the gusset plate and extending horizontally along the upper portion of the gusset
plate. The first leg of each upper angle iron 31 is attached in a suitable manner such as
by weld 29 to the outer surface of the respective gusset plate 21. (Fig. 4). A horizontal
second leg of the upper angle iron 31 projects from the vertical first leg of the upper
angle iron and laterally away from the gusset plate 21 and away from the beam 19.
The second leg of each upper angle iron 31 is attached in a suitable manner such as by
weld 29 to a top edge of the gusset plate 21. In the illustrated embodiment, the first
and second legs of the upper angle irons 31 are disposed at substantially a right angle
to each other. A top surface of the horizontal second leg of each upper angle iron 31 is
bolted to a bottom surface of the cover plate 27 by horizontally spaced bolts 26
extending through aligned bolt holes 26A in the second leg of the upper angle irons and
cover plate. In another embodiment (not shown), the upper angle irons 31 can be
                                                             12
9841453_1 (GHMatters) P99909.AU.2

configured such that the lateral edges of the second legs project laterally past the
lateral edges of the cover plate 27 to provide a ledger support for metal floor decking
spanning perpendicular to beam 19. This reduces construction cost by reducing steel
material and welding time, and by speeding the floor construction of the building.
Similarly, the horizontal shear plates 23 can extend laterally (perpendicular to the
column web) to also serve as metal decking support if there is no perpendicular steel
frame member framing into the gusset plates 21. Further, the top surfaces of the
second legs of the upper angle irons 31 are disposed above the top edges of the
gusset plates 21 to allow welds between the top edges of the gusset plates 21 and the
interior faces of the vertical first legs of the angle irons 31. The upper angle irons 31
may be otherwise configured and/or arranged within the scope of the present
disclosure.
             [00166]              Referring to Figs. 4 and 9-12, lower angle irons 33 (broadly, "lower
connecting members") are attached to a bottom surface of the bottom flange of the full
length beam 19. The lower angle irons 33 may comprise elongate L-shaped members
including a horizontal first leg attached to the bottom surface of the bottom flange of the
beam 19 at opposite side portions of the beam and extending horizontally along the
side portions. The first leg of each lower angle iron 33 is attached in a suitable manner
such as by weld 29 to the bottom surface of the bottom flange of the beam 19, and
along the bottom flange tips of the beam 19. Each lower angle iron 33 may also include
a second leg projecting from the first leg of the lower angle iron and downward, away
from the beam 19. In the illustrated embodiment, the first and second legs of each
lower angle iron 33 are disposed at substantially a right angle to each other. An outer
surface of the vertical second leg of each lower angle iron 33 is bolted to an inner
surface of a respective gusset plate 21 by horizontally spaced bolts 26 extending
through aligned bolt holes 26A in the second leg of the lower angle iron and the gusset
plate 21. In the illustrated embodiment, the lower angle irons 33 are configured such
that the horizontal first legs extend laterally past the lateral edges of the bottom flange
of the beam 19 so the outer surfaces of the vertical second legs are disposed laterally
away from the flange tips of the bottom flange of the beam 19. The lower angle irons
33 may be otherwise configured and/or arranged within the scope of the present
invention. Although angle irons 33 are illustrated, other forms of connecting members
may be used.

             [00167]              The joint connection structure 11 outlined above is a beam-to-column
type structure. It will be understood by a person having ordinary skill in the art that a
beam-to-column-to-beam type structure will have additional analogous components.
Most preferably, each of the components of the joint connection structure 11, as well as
the beam 19 and column 15, are made of structural steel. Some of the components of
the joint connection structure 11 are united by welding and some by bolting. The
welding may be initially performed at a fabrication shop. The bolting may be performed
at the construction site, which is the preferred option in many regions of the world.
             [00168]              Referring to Fig. 9, the full-length beam assembly 17 may be
fabricated at a fabrication shop prior to being transported to the construction site. To
fabricate the full-length beam assembly 17, the cover plate 27 is welded at 29 or
otherwise attached to the upper flange of the beam. Welding (such as by weld 29) is
carried out between the periphery of the slot opening 30 and the top flange of the beam
19, and along the top flange tips of the beam on the underside of the cover plate. The
slot opening 30 provides additional flexibility for field installation for cases where there
is a skewed orientation of the top beam flange (non-plumb slant) relative to the plumb
web of the beam 19, where the erector needs to rotate the beam slightly around its
longitudinal axis to resolve a particular beam-to-column erection fit up concern, or
where there is a lateral horizontal offset in the beam or column 15 (in the out-of-plane
direction, perpendicular to the plane of the moment-resisting frame). The slot opening
30 also reduces out of plane bowing during the welding processes, thus improving
performance. The slot opening 30 also allows for smaller sized fillet welds connecting
the cover plate 27 to the top surface of the upper flange and to the upper flange tips of
the beam 19. This permits the cover plate 27 to be connected to the upper flange of
the beam 19 using only one pass welds, which reduces construction time and material
cost. The lower angle irons 33 are welded at 29 or otherwise attached to the bottom
flange of the beam and project laterally outwardly from the beam. Any welds needed to
form the full-length beam assembly 17 can be carried out at the shop. In a preferred
embodiment, the welds 29 are fillet welds. Fillet welds do not require ultra-sonic
inspection which results in reduced shop fabrication costs. However, the welds could
be groove welds or stitch welds. Other welds are also within the scope of the present
disclosure. The cover plate 27 and lower angle irons 33 may have other configurations
than those illustrated in the current embodiment.
                                                               14
9841453_1 (GHMatters) P99909.AU.2

             [00169]              Referring to FIG. 5, the column assembly 13 may also be fabricated at
a fabrication shop and later transported to the construction site. To fabricate the
column assembly 13, the gusset plates 21 are welded at 29 or otherwise attached to
the flanges of the column 15, the optional horizontal shear plates 23 are welded at 29
or otherwise attached to the web of the column and to the top and bottom edges of the
gusset plates, and the upper angle irons 31 are welded at 29 or otherwise attached to
the gusset plates 21. Thus, at the shop, the column assembly 13 can be constructed
exclusively by welds. In a preferred embodiment, the welds 29 are fillet welds. Fillet
welds do not require ultra-sonic inspection which results in reduced shop fabrication
costs. However, the welds could be groove welds or stitch welds. Other welds are also
within the scope of the present disclosure. The horizontal shear plates 23 can be
omitted from the column assembly 13 and the gusset plates 21 may have other
configurations than shown.
             [00170]              At the construction site, the column assembly 13 is joined to the full
length beam assembly 17. The column assembly 13 is first erected in a vertical
orientation and the end of the full-length beam assembly 17 is positioned horizontally
and adjacent to the column assembly, so that each end of the beam is over a
respective pair of gusset plates 21. The full-length beam assembly 17 is then lowered
between the gusset plates 21 until the bottom surface of the cover plate 27 engages the
top surfaces of the horizontal second legs of the upper angle irons 31. This
engagement initially locates and supports the full-length beam assembly 17 on the
column assembly 13 to facilitate shoring during erection. To fixedly secure the two
assemblies 13, 17 bolts 26 are used to attach the upper angle irons 31 to the cover
plate 27 and the lower angle irons 33 to the gusset plates 21 through aligned bolt holes
26A in the respective components. Bolt holes 26A in the cover plate 27 are slotted
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the beam 19 (e.g., elongated as shown in Fig.
11) to facilitate attachment and erection fit up of the cover plate to the upper angle irons
31. In addition to or instead of the slotting of the bolt holes 26A in the cover plate 27,
corresponding bolt holes in the horizontal second leg of each upper angle iron 31 can
be slotted perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the beam. Bolt holes 26A near the
bottom edge of the horizontal extension of gusset plates 21 may also be slotted in the
vertical direction (e.g., elongated as shown in Fig. 6) to facilitate attachment and
erection fit up of the lower angle irons 33 to the gusset plates. In addition to or instead
of slotting the bolt holes 26A in the gusset plates 21, corresponding bolt holes in the
                                                              15
9841453_1 (GHMatters) P99909.AU.2

second leg of the lower angle irons 33 can be slotted in the vertical direction. Thus, at
the construction site, the beam-to-column moment-resisting joint connection structure
11, which includes a full-length beam assembly 17, is completed exclusively through
bolted connections. In the field, the joint connection structure 11 is constructed without
the use of welds. The cover plate 27 is designed to transfer most, if not all, of the
vertical shear load from the full-length beam 19, thus eliminating the need for the
vertical shear plates 23, while also reducing material and construction costs. This full
length beam, all field bolted joint connection structure employing gusset plates was not
appreciated in conventional joint connection structures.
             [00171]              The intentional offset positioning of the top horizontal edge of the
gusset plates 21 slightly below the top of steel elevation of the beam 19, a result of the
top surfaces of the second legs of the upper angle irons 31 being disposed above the
top edges of the gusset plates 21, precludes the inadvertent non-plumb positioning of
the top edge of the gusset plates from affecting the desired near flush contact between
the cover plate 27 and the top faces of the horizontal leg of the upper angle irons 31
prior to bolting these two components together. This is because the top edges of the
gusset plates 21 are vertically spaced below the interface between the angle irons 31
and cover plate 27 providing space for the angle irons 31 to be suitably positioned to
account for any inadvertent non-plumb positioning of the gusset plates with respect to
the column 15. In particular, the vertical leg of each upper angle iron 31 is positioned
plumb to the column' s web in the shop and welded inthat position to the gusset plates
21 regardless of any possible non-plumb positioning of the top horizontal edge of the
gusset plates with respect to the column 15, thus achieving a near flush fit up. The
offset of the horizontal legs of the angle irons 31 above the upper edges of the gusset
plates 21 also allows the vertical leg of the upper angle irons 31 to be horizontally
welded to the gusset plates 21 at two locations, the first being at the toe of the vertical
leg of the angle iron, and the second being near the heel of that vertical leg, thus
improving significantly the performance of load transfer between the gusset plates 21
and their respective connecting upper angle irons 31 by providing a force couple that
increases strength of the attachment of the angle iron to the gusset plate.

widened cover plate 27 inherently maximizes the efficiency of cost and time of field
installation because the design geometry can specifically accommodate worst-case
scenarios of cumulative permissible variations in cross section for rolled steel column
                                                             16

and beam shapes (referred to in the industry as "standard mill practice tolerances"),
resulting in less probability of field adjustments needed to accommodate as-built
column assemblies and full-length beam assemblies. In particular, the joint connection
structure 11 can account for possible vertical separation (or gap) between the
underside of the cover plate 27 and the upper angle irons 31, due to a skewed (non
plumb to the web of the beam 19 but within standard mill practice) upper flange
orientation of the beam 19. In particular, the clamping action of the upper bolts 26 upon
being tensioned during installation automatically closes the gap between the cover
plate 27 and the upper angle irons 31, through deformation of the cover plate and the
horizontal legs of the upper angle irons. In this way, the need for burdensome shim
plates to fill the separation between faying surfaces, or other means of remediation in
the field, prior to tightening the bolts is eliminated.
             [00173]              The bolted joint connection structure of the present invention also
increases construction tolerance for misalignment of components during field steel
frame erection because of the slotting of the bolt holes 26A in which some are
elongated in a vertical direction and others are slotted in a horizontal direction that is
transverse to the longitudinal axis of the beam 19. As a consequence of this
construction, the long dimensions of the upper bolts 26 are oriented vertically, and the
long dimension of the lower bolts 26 being oriented transverse to a longitudinal
direction of the beam 19. The unique direction of slotted bolt holes 26A provides
significantly greater shear capacity compared to conventional designs, while
significantly reducing misalignment uncertainties during erection. Thus, the need for
uncertain reaming of standard bolt holes in the field or the use of oversized bolt holes
with slip-critical bolts to accommodate unanticipated field adjustments to the as-built
condition is precluded with the bolted joint connection structure 11. Slip-critical bolts
are bolts that are typically installed in oversized circular bolt holes that depend on the
development of friction forces between clamped faying surfaces to prevent bolt slip
through the pre-tensioning of the bolts. Bolts designated as "slip-critical" are typically
received through bolt holes having an opening diameter that is about 3/16 in. larger
than the diameter of the bolt. Bolts designated as "slip critical" require costly and
restrictive surface-clean conditions, and the use of special primer coatings over defined
clamped faying surfaces, and require an independent special inspection for use, which
is costly and time consuming. Slip-critical bolts with circular oversized holes also have
a significantly reduced load capacity in shear as compared to standard bolts (i.e., bolts
                                                            17
9841453_1 (GHMatters) P99909.AU.2

received through bolt holes having an opening diameter that is about 1/16 in. larger
than the diameter of the bolt). Thus, a much greater number of slip-critical bolts are
required to withstand a given load, as compared to the required number of standard
bolts..
             [00174]              Unlike oversized holes requiring the use of slip-critical bolts, the
slotted bolt holes 26A are larger than standard bolt holes in only one direction. Also,
the slot direction of the bolt holes 26A is perpendicular to the direction of load, that is,
does not extend along the longitudinal axis of the beam 19. Instead, the slots of the
bolt holes 26A extend perpendicular (broadly, "transverse") to the longitudinal axis of
the beam 19 so that when the joint connection structure 11 is loaded, and in particular
when the beam is loaded axially along its length or about its major axis in bending, a
gap is not formed between the bolts 26 and their respective bolt holes 26A (i.e., no slip
of bolt occurs because bolts 26 are already loaded by direct bearing in shear). As used
herein "transverse" to the longitudinal axis of the beam 19 means any direction that
crosses over the longitudinal axis of the beam and is not parallel to the longitudinal axis
of the beam. In some embodiments, the bolt holes 26A have a slotted dimension that is
up to about 2.5 times the diameter of the bolt 26. In some embodiments, the bolt holes
26A have a slotted dimension that is from about 3/16 in. up to about 2 % in. larger than
the diameter of the bolt 26. In a preferred embodiment, the bolt holes 26A have a
slotted dimension that is about % in. larger than the diameter of the bolt 26.
             [00175]              Slotting the bolt holes 26A along the bottom portion of the gusset
plates 21 (or in the vertical leg of each lower angle iron 33) provides a longer vertical
dimension for the bolt holes to account for any alignment problems that can arise from
the bottom flange of the beam 19 being skewed from an exactly perpendicular
orientation with respect to the web of the beam and/or the web of the beam not being
plumb. Slotting the bolt holes 26A in the cover plate 27 (or the horizontal leg of each of
the upper angle irons 31) provides a longer lateral horizontal dimension for the bolt
holes to accommodate transverse alignment problems that can arise from the
construction of the beam 19. Thus, the unique orientation of slotted bolt holes 26A in
the joint connection structure 11 require alignment accuracy in only one out of three
possible translational degrees of freedom (i.e., along the longitudinal axis of the beam
19). This is in contrast to having to resolve alignment accuracy challenges in as many
as three degrees of freedom using conventional joint connection structures. Greater
tolerance for misalignment during the erection of beam 19 and column 15 is achieved
                                                             18
9841453_1 (GHMatters) P99909.AU.2

with the use of the unique orientation of the slotted bolt holes. Bolts 26 installed in the
unique orientation of the slotted bolt holes 26A of this invention also have comparable
shear load and bearing capacity to bolts using standard bolt holes, so significantly
fewer bolt holes and bolts are required to withstand a given load than would be required
if slip-critical bolts were used. According to current industry design standards, the
capacity of a bolt received in the slotted bolt hole elongated in the direction(s)
prescribed by the present invention provides an increase in shear load capacity of two
or more times that provided by slip-critical bolts with circular oversized holes. As a
result, the number of bolts required for the joint connections, the associated labor costs,
and the overall erection time in the field are all decreased. .
             [00176]              Conventional joint connection structures typically include bolted
connections which orient the bolts that connect the beam assembly to the column
assembly so that all the bolts extend along the length of the beam assembly or so that
all the bolts associated with load transfer from beam flanges extend transverse to the
length of the beam assembly. These configurations require alignment accuracy in at
least two, and as many as three degrees of freedom. The directions of the degrees of
freedom include along the longitudinal axis of the beam, a direction along the
longitudinal axis of the column, and a direction transverse to the longitudinal axes of the
beam and column). The current disclosure of horizontally slotted bolt holes 26A
oriented transverse to the longitudinal axis of the beam 19, and the vertically slotted
bolt holes 26A configures the joint connection structure 11 so that alignment accuracy
is only required in one degree of freedom (i.e., along the longitudinal axis of the beam
19). Thus, alignment accuracy is required only along one axis of the joint connection
structure 1. Accordingly, connecting the full-length beam assembly 17 to the column
assembly 13 is significantly easier to accomplish in the field.
             [00177]              The unique geometry and stiffness of this all shop fillet-welded and all
field-bolted beam-to-column moment-resisting joint connection structure 11 maximizes
its performance and the broadness of its design applications, including both extreme
wind and moderate-to-severe seismic conditions. In particular, the all field-bolted joint
connection structure 11 preserves the physical separation (or gap) between the end of
a full-length beam 19 and the flange face of the column 15 made possible by the use of
vertically and horizontally extended parallel gusset plates 21 that sandwich the column
and the beam similar to prior designs which feature an all field fillet-welded joint
connection structure; thus eliminating all of the uncertainty of bending moment load
                                                           19

transfer between a rigidly attached steel moment frame beam and column used in the
past.
             [00178]              Further, by including the vertically and horizontally extending parallel
gusset plates 21 that sandwich both the column 15 and the beam 19, this current all
field-bolted joint connection structure 11 preserves the advantage of increased beam
to-column joint stiffness, with a corresponding increase in overall steel moment frame
stiffness, which results in smaller beam sizes when the building design is controlled by
lateral story drift (not member strength), and hence reduced material costs. When the
building design is controlled by member strength (not lateral story drift), this all field
bolted joint connection structure 11 also reduces the beam size and the column size,
and hence material quantities and cost, because its connection geometry has no net
section reduction in either the beam or the column (i.e., no bolt holes through either the
beam or column), thereby maintaining the full strength of the beam and column.
             [00179]              In one aspect of the present disclosure, a full-length beam is
connected to gusset plates by bolts so that the full-length beam and gusset plates are
substantially free of welded connection. It will be understood that welding the column
assembly 13 to the full-length beam assembly 17 is within the scope of that aspect of
the disclosure.
             [00180]              Referring to Figs. 13-24, a beam-to-column moment-resisting joint
connection structure of a second embodiment is generally indicated at 111. In the
illustrated embodiment, the joint connection joins a column assembly 113 including a
column 115 to a full-length beam assembly 117 including a full-length beam 119. The
joint connection structure 111 of the second embodiment is substantially identical to the
joint connection structure 11 of the first embodiment. Parts of the joint connection
structure 111 of the second embodiment corresponding to those of the joint connection
structure 11 of the first embodiment will be given the same reference numeral plus
"100". This numbering convention is repeated in subsequent embodiments. The joint
connection structure 111 further includes a stiffener bar 132 attached to a top surface of
cover plate 127 in the joint connection structure 111 and vertical shear plates 128
attached to a web of the beam 119 and bolted to the gusset plates 121 by way of
vertical angle irons 134 attached to the vertical shear plates.
             [00181]              The stiffener bar 132 is attached in a suitable manner such as by
welds 129 to the top surface of the cover plate 127. In the illustrated embodiment, the
stiffener bar 132 is attached to the cover plate 127 between adjacent horizontally
                                                             20

spaced bolts 126 received through bolt holes 126A to attach the cover plate to upper
angle irons 131. The stiffener bar 132 extends horizontally across the cover plate 127
transverse to a length of the beam 119. Lateral edges of the stiffener bar 132 are flush
with longitudinal edges of the cover plate 127. The stiffener bar 132 may be otherwise
configured and/or arranged within the scope of the present disclosure. The stiffener bar
 132 is optional.
             [00182]              The vertical shear plates 128 are welded or otherwise attached to
opposite sides of the web of the beam 119 (Fig. 24). Each of the vertical angle irons
 134 is attached in a suitable manner such as by welds 129 at the toe and heel of the
 leg of the angle iron abutting the web of the beam 119. Bolt holes 126A in the other leg
of the angle iron 134 receive bolts 126 extending through corresponding bolt holes
 126A in the gusset plate 11 to connect the web of the beam 119 to the gusset plate. In
the illustrated embodiment, the bolt holes 126A in the angle iron 134 are slotted in a
direction parallel to the length of the beam. The vertical shear plates 128 and angle
 irons 134 are optional.
             [00183]              Referring to Figs. 25-36, a beam-to-column moment-resisting joint
connection structure of a third embodiment is generally indicated at 211. In the
illustrated embodiment, the joint connection joins a column assembly 213 including a
column 215 to a full-length beam assembly 217 including a full-length beam 219. The
joint connection structure 211 of the third embodiment is substantially identical to the
joint connection structure 11 of the first embodiment. The only differences between the
two embodiments is cover plate 227 has a closed oblong radiused slot opening 230
extending along the length of the cover plate. It will be understood that the cover plate
227 may have other widths, configurations and slot-type oblong openings. For
example, multiple smaller slots may be used in place of a single, larger slot (e.g., slot
230). The smaller slots can be punched out of the cover plate rather than cut out.
             [00184]              Referring to Figs. 37-48, a beam-to-column moment-resisting joint
connection structure of a fourth embodiment is generally indicated at 311. In the
illustrated embodiment, the joint connection joins a column assembly 313 including a
column 315 to a full-length beam assembly 317 including a full-length beam 319. The
joint connection structure 311 of the fourth embodiment is substantially identical to the
joint connection structure 211 of the third embodiment. The only difference between
the two embodiments is the addition of a stiffener bar 332 attached to a top surface of
cover plate 327 in the joint connection structure 311.

             [00185]              Referring to Figs. 49-60, a beam-to-column moment-resisting joint
connection structure of a fifth embodiment is generally indicated at 411. The joint
connection structure may be used in the construction of a building framework. In the
illustrated embodiment, the joint connection joins a column assembly 413 including a
column 415 to a full-length beam assembly 417 including a full-length beam 419.
             [00186]              A spaced apart pair of parallel, vertically and horizontally extending
gusset plates 421 sandwich the column 415 and beam 419. Four horizontal shear
plates 423 (only three are shown in Fig. 49) are arranged in vertically spaced pairs
generally aligned at top and bottom edges of the gusset plates 421. Two angle irons
(broadly, "connecting members") 425A are disposed on an upper flange of the beam
419 at an end of the beam. The angle irons 425A are horizontally spaced from one
another and extend along a length of the beam 419. The angle irons 425A connect the
gusset plates 421 to the upper flange of the beam 419. The angle irons 425A are L
shaped in cross section. Each angle iron 425A may include a horizontal first leg
attached to the upper flange of the beam 419 and a vertical second leg projecting from
the first leg perpendicular to the length of the beam. The first leg is attached in a
suitable manner such as by a weld 429 between the toe of the first leg and the top
surface of the upper flange of the beam 419 and by a weld 429 on the underside of the
first leg to the tips of the upper flange. An outer surface of the second leg of each angle
iron 425A are bolted to an inner surface of a respective gusset plate 421 by horizontally
spaced bolts 426 extending through aligned bolt holes 426A in the second leg of the
angle iron and respective gusset plate. Instead of two angle irons 425A for example, a
single channel welded to the top flange could be employed.
             [00187]              Two angle irons (broadly, "connecting members") 425B are disposed
on a lower flange of the beam 419 at an end of the beam (see, Figs. 52 and 57). The
angle irons 425B are horizontally spaced from one another and extend along a length
of the beam 419. The angle irons 425B connect the gusset plates 421 to the lower
flange of the beam 419. The angle irons 425B are L-shaped in cross section. Each
angle iron 425B may include a horizontal first leg attached to the lower flange of the
beam 419 and a vertical second leg projecting from the first leg perpendicular to the
length of the beam. The first leg is attached in a suitable manner to the bottom face of
the lower flange of the beam 419 such as by a weld 429 between a toe of the first leg
and the bottom surface of the lower flange of the beam 419 and a weld 429 between a
top surface of the first leg and a tip of the lower flange.. An outer surface of the second

leg of each angle iron 425B is bolted to an inner surface of a respective gusset plate
421 by horizontally spaced bolts 426 extending through aligned bolt holes 426A in the
second leg of the angle iron and respective gusset plate. Instead of two angle irons
425B a single channel welded to the top flange could be employed. Moreover, different
combinations of connecting structure could be used. For example, one flange of the
beam 419 might use two angle irons, while the other flange of the beam uses a
channel.
             [00188]               The bolt holes 426A in the angle irons 425A, 425B may be larger
than the bolt holes 426A in the gusset plates 421 to facilitate placement of one or more
of the bolts 426 through slightly misaligned holes 426A. In particular, the bolt holes
426A in the gusset plates 421 would be standard size and the bolt holes 426A in the
angle irons 425A, 425B would be vertically slotted, and the bolts would be inserted first
through the standard sized holes in the gusset plates 421 and then into the slotted bolt
holes of the angle irons 425A, 425B. It will be appreciated that similar slotting of one of
two mating holes may be used to facilitate bolting the components together in all
embodiments may be employed. The bolt connection allows workers in the field to
draw the gusset plates 421 into flush engagement with the angle irons 425A, 425B
even with the initial gap between the gusset plates and full-length beam assembly 417,
without the need of external clamping means.
             [00189]              Referring to Figs. 57-60, the full-length beam assembly 417 may be
fabricated at a fabrication shop prior to being transported to the construction site. To
fabricate the full-length beam assembly 417, the angle irons 425A, 425B are welded at
429 or otherwise attached to the upper and lower flanges of the beam 419. Any welds
on the beam assembly needed to form the joint connection structure can be made at
the shop. The angle irons 425A, 425B may have other configurations than those
illustrated in the current embodiment.
             [00190]              Referring to Figs. 53-56, the column assembly 413 may also be
fabricated at a fabrication shop and later transported to the construction site. To
fabricate the column assembly 413, the gusset plates 421 are welded at 429 or
otherwise attached to the flanges of the column 415, the optional horizontal shear
plates 423 are welded at 429 or otherwise attached to the web of the column and to the
top and bottom edges of the gusset plates. Any welds on the column assembly 413
needed to form the beam-to-column moment-resisting joint may be carried out at the
shop. The horizontal shear plates 423 can be omitted from the column assembly 413.

The gusset plates 421 can have other configurations than those illustrated in the
current embodiment. For instance, the gusset plates 421 could have a smaller vertical
dimension so that the gusset plates are flush with top and bottom edges of the
respective angle irons 425A, 425B rather than extending above and below the angle
irons as shown in the illustrated embodiment. The angle irons 425A, 425B may have
configurations other than those illustrated in the embodiment.
             [00191]              At the construction site, the column assembly 413 is joined to the full
length beam assembly 417. The column assembly 413 is first erected in a vertical
orientation and the end of the full-length beam assembly 417 is positioned horizontally
and adjacent to the column assembly, over the gusset plates 421. The full-length beam
assembly 417 is then lowered between the gusset plates 421 such that the gusset
plates are disposed on opposite sides of the beam 419 and angle irons 425A, 425B of
the full-length beam assembly 417. To fixedly secure the two assemblies 413, 417,
horizontally spaced bolts 426 are used to attach the gusset plates 421 to the angle
irons 425A, 425B through aligned bolt holes in the respective components. Thus, at the
construction site, the beam-to-column moment-resisting joint connection structure 411
is completed exclusively through bolt connections. So in the field, the beam-to-column
joint connection structure 411 is constructed without the use of welds. The joint
connection structure 411 can be used if the building frame is dimensionally close to the
exterior curtain wall of the building because the angle irons 425A, 425B are on the
inside of the gusset plates 421.
             [00192]              The joint connection structure 411 may also be constructed with a
 ledger angle 440 (Fig. 52A) attached by the same bolts 426 that attach the column and
 beam assemblies 413, 417, thus saving material. Only one ledger angle 440 is shown
 in Fig. 52A. Others would be used in a typical construction, such as a ledger angle like
the ledger angle 440 shown, but on the opposite side of the top flange of the beam 419.
The bolt 426 that attaches the ledger angle 440 to the assemblies 413, 417 may also
attach angle irons 425A to the gusset plates 421. As understood by persons skilled in
the art, the ledger is configured to support floor decking (not shown).
             [00193]              Referring to Figs. 61-72, a beam-to-column moment-resisting joint
connection structure of a sixth embodiment is generally indicated at 511. The joint
connection structure may be used in the construction of a building framework. In the
illustrated embodiment, the joint connection structure 511 joins a column assembly 513

gusset plates 521 sandwich the column 515 and end of beam 519. Four optional
horizontal shear plates 523 (only three are shown in Fig. 61) are arranged in vertically
spaced pairs generally aligned at top and bottom edges of the gusset plates 521. Two
angle irons (broadly, "connecting members") 525 are disposed on an upper flange of
the beam 519 at an end of the beam. The angle irons 525 are horizontally spaced from
one another and extend along a length of the beam 519. The angle irons 525 connect
the gusset plates 521 to the upper flange of the beam 519. The angle irons 525 are L
shaped in cross section. Each angle iron 525 may include a horizontal first leg
attached to the upper flange of the beam 519 and a vertical second leg projecting
upwardly from the first leg transverse to the length of the beam. The angle iron 525
may be attached to the upper flange of the beam 519 in the same way as the angle
irons 425A were attached to the upper flange of the beam 419 in the fifth embodiment.
An outer surface of the second leg of each angle iron 525 is bolted to an inner surface
of a respective gusset plate 521 by horizontally spaced bolts 526 extending through
aligned bolt holes 526A in the second leg of the angle iron and respective gusset plate.
Instead of two angle irons 525 a single channel welded to the top flange could be
employed.
             [00195]              A bottom flange of the beam 519 rests on a cover plate 527 at the end
of the beam, which acts as a bearing saddle support for the end of the full-length beam
assembly 517. The cover plate 527 is attached in a suitable manner such as by welds
529 to the bottom edge of each gusset plate 521 or near the bottom edges of the
gusset plate. The cover plate 527 has a width that is greater than a width of the beam
519 and may be greater than a horizontal spacing of the gusset plates 521. The
configuration of the cover plate 527 allows the beam 519 to be lowered between the
gusset plates 521 so that the bottom flange of the beam can rest and bear on an upper
surface of the cover plate in a self-shoring condition before fixedly securing the beam
assembly 517 to column assembly 513. Thus, the beam 519 is fully supported by the
column assembly 513 once the end of the beam is placed between the gusset plates
521 onto the top cover plate 527. It will be understood that the cover plate 527 may
have other widths within the scope of the present invention. To fixedly secure the beam
519 to the cover plate 527, the bottom flange of the beam is bolted to the upper surface
                                                            25

of the cover plate 527 by horizontally spaced bolts 526 extending through aligned bolt
holes 526A (see, Fig. 67) in the beam bottom flange and cover plate 527. The bolt
holes 526A in the cover plate 527 are larger than the bolt holes 526A in the beam
flange to facilitate placement of one or more of the bolts 526 through slightly misaligned
holes 526A. In particular, the bolt holes 526A in the beam flange would be standard
size and the bolt holes 526A in the cover plate 527 would be oversized (e.g., elongated
or oversized diameter) and the bolts would be inserted first through the larger holes into
the standard sized holes. The bolt holes 526A in the angle irons 525 may also be
larger than the bolt holes 526A in the gusset plates 521. As such, the bolt holes 526A
in the gusset plates 521 would be standard size and the bolt holes 526A in the angle
irons 525 would be oversized. The component having the oversized hole can be
switched or both components may have oversized holes. The bolt connection allows
workers in the field to draw the gusset plates 521 into flush engagement with the angle
irons 525 and beam 519 even with the initial gap between the gusset plates and full
length beam assembly 517. Moreover, the lower flange of the beam 519 is drawn flush
against the supporting cover plate 527 by the bolts.
             [00196]              Figs. 64A-64C illustrates some variations for the joint connection
structure 511. Figure 64A shows the beam 519 having bolts 520 either formed as one
piece with or fixedly attached as by welding to the bottom surface of the bottom flange
of the beam 519. The bolts 520 would be received in the holes in the cover plate 527
when the beam end portion is lowered into place between the gusset plates 521.
Figure 64B shows a cover plate 527A received between gusset plates 21 and
positioned upward away from a bottom end of the gusset plates. Figure 64C shows a
second lower pair of angle irons 525A located below the upper flange of the beam 519,
which are bolted to the top flange of the beam. The horizontal leg of the upper first pair
of angle irons 25 is not welded to the top flange of the beam, but rather is also bolted
using the bolt that connects the second lower pair of angle irons. In fact, none of the
angle irons 525, 525A is welded to the beam. Thus, these bolts that are common to
both the first and second pair of angle irons act in double shear to resist bending
moments from the beam 519 which doubles the bolt capacity and thereby reduces the
number of bolts required. Where feasible, these alternative configurations can be
incorporated into the other disclosed embodiments.
             [00197]              Referring to Figs. 69-72, the full-length beam assembly 517 may be
fabricated at a fabrication shop prior to being transported to the construction site. To
                                                             26

fabricate the full-length beam assembly 517, the angle irons 525 are welded at 529 or
otherwise attached to the upper flange of the beam 519. The bolt holes 526A may also
be formed at the shop. Any welding of the beam assembly 517 needed for forming the
joint can be done at the shop. Although angle irons 525 are illustrated, other forms of
connecting structure may be used, such as a connecting structure having a channel
shaped cross section.
             [00198]              Referring to Figs. 65-68, the column assembly 513 may also be
fabricated at a fabrication shop and later transported to the construction site. To
fabricate the column assembly 513, the gusset plates 521 are welded at 529 or
otherwise attached to the flanges of the column 515, the horizontal shear plates 523 (if
desired) are welded at 529 (Fig. 67) or otherwise attached to the web of the column and
to the top and bottom edges of the gusset plates, and the cover plate 527 is welded at
529 or otherwise attached to the bottom edges of the gusset plates. Any welding of the
column assembly 511 needed for forming the joint connection structure 513 can be
done at the shop. The gusset plates 521 and attached cover plate 527 form a
receptacle or saddle support for receiving and supporting the end of the beam
assembly 517. The saddle support of the cover plate 527 also provides a permanent
spacer to maintain the required separation between the gusset plates 521 during
transport to the field, and during erection of the full-length beam assembly to the
column assembly. The horizontal shear plates 523 can be omitted from the column
assembly 513. The gusset plates 521 and cover plate 527 can have other
configurations than those illustrated in the current embodiment.
             [00199]              At the construction site, the column assembly 513 is joined to the full
 length beam assembly 517. The column assembly 513 is first erected in a vertical
orientation and the end of the full-length beam assembly 517 is positioned adjacent the
column assembly, over the gusset plates 521. The full-length beam assembly 517 is
then lowered between the gusset plates 521 until the bottom flange of the beam 519
engages the top surface of the cover plate 527. This engagement locates, positions,
and supports the end of the full-length beam assembly 517 on the column assembly
513. To fixedly secure the two assemblies 513, 517, bolts 526 are used to attach the
angle irons 525 to the gusset plates 521, and the bottom beam flange to the cover plate
527 through aligned bolt holes 526A in the respective components. Thus, at the
construction site, the joint connection structure 511 is completed exclusively through
                                                              27

bolt connections. So in the field, the beam-to-column moment resisting joint connection
structure 511 is constructed without the use of welds.
             [00200]              Figs. 64A-64C illustrates some variations for the joint connection
structure 511. Figure 64A shows the beam 519 having bolts 520 either formed as one
piece with or fixedly attached as by welding to the bottom surface of the bottom flange
of the beam 519. The bolts 520 would be received in the holes in the cover plate 527
when the beam end portion is lowered into place between the gusset plates 521.
Figure 64B shows a cover plate 527A received between gusset plates 21 and
positioned upward away from a bottom edges of the gusset plates. Figure 64C shows
a second lower pair of angle irons 525A located below the upper flange of the beam
519, which are bolted to the top flange of the beam. The horizontal leg of the upper first
pair of angle irons 525 is not welded to the top flange of the beam, but rather is also
bolted using the bolt that connects the second lower pair of angle irons. In fact, none of
the angle irons 525, 525A is welded to the beam. Thus, these bolts that are common to

             [00201]              Referring to Figs. 73-84, a beam-to-column moment-resisting joint
connection structure of a seventh embodiment is generally indicated at 611. In the
illustrated embodiment, the joint connection joins a column assembly 613 including a
column 615 to a full-length beam assembly 617 including a full-length beam 619.
             [00202]              A spaced apart pair of parallel, vertically and horizontally extending
gusset plates 621 sandwich the column 615 and full-length beam 619. Four optional
horizontal shear plates 623 (only three are shown in Fig. 73) are arranged in vertically
spaced pairs generally aligned at top and bottom edges of the gusset plates 621 as
illustrated in the previous embodiments. Vertical flange plates 625 (broadly,
"connecting members") are disposed on each side of the beam 619 and attached to the
tips of each flange of the beam 619 as by welding at 629. The gusset plates 621 have
holes that receive bolts 626 that pass through holes 626A in the flange plates 625.
The flange plates 625 facilitate connection of the beam 619 to the gusset plates 621.
             [00203]              Referring to Figs. 77-80, the column assembly 613 may be fabricated
at a fabrication shop and later transported to the construction site. To fabricate the
column assembly 613, the gusset plates 621 are welded at 629 or otherwise attached

to the flanges of the column 615 and the horizontal shear plates 623 are welded at 629
or otherwise attached to the web of the column and to the top and bottom edges of the
gusset plates. Any welds needed on the column assembly 613 for forming the joint can
be made at the shop. The horizontal shear plates 623 can be omitted from the column
assembly 613. The gusset plates 621 can have other configurations than those
illustrated in the current embodiment.
             [00204]              Referring to Figs. 81-84, the full-length beam assembly 617 may also
be fabricated at a fabrication shop prior to being transported to the construction site. To
fabricate the full-length beam assembly 617, inner surfaces of the flange plates 625 are
welded at 629 or otherwise attached to the flange tips of the beam 619. Separate
welds 629 can connect each flange plate 625 to the top and bottom surfaces of a
respective flange of the beam 619. Any welds to the beam assembly 617 needed to
form the joint connection structure can be made at the shop. The flange plates 625 and
may have other configurations than those illustrated in the current embodiment.
             [00205]              At the construction site, the column assembly 613 is joined to the full
length beam assembly 617. The column assembly 613 is first erected in a vertical
orientation and the end of the full-length beam assembly 617 is positioned adjacent the
column assembly. The full-length beam assembly 617 is then lowered between the
gusset plates 621 such that the gusset plates are disposed on opposite sides of the
beam 619 and flange plates 625 of the full-length beam assembly 617. To fixedly
secure the two assemblies 613, 617, bolts 626 are used to attach the gusset plates 621
to the flange plates 625 through aligned bolt holes 626A in the respective components.
The bolt holes 626A can be slotted as described for prior embodiments of this
invention. Thus, at the construction site, the joint connection structure 611 is completed
exclusively through bolt connections. So in the field, the joint connection structure 611
is constructed without the use of welds. The joint connection structure 611 can be used
if the building frame is close to the exterior curtain wall of the building because the
flange plates 625 are on the inside of the gusset plates 621.
             [00206]              Referring to Figs. 85-96, a beam-to-column moment-resisting joint
connection structure of an eighth embodiment is generally indicated at 711. In the
illustrated embodiment, the joint connection joins a column assembly 713 including a
column 715 to a full-length beam assembly 717 including a full-length beam 719.
             [00207]              A spaced apart pair of parallel, vertically and horizontally extending

(only three are shown in Fig. 85) are arranged in vertically spaced pairs generally
aligned at top and bottom edges of the gusset plates 721 as illustrated in the previous
embodiments. A channel-shaped end plate 725 (broadly, "a connecting member") is
disposed on an axially facing end of the beam 719. The end plate 725 provides a
connection of the full-length beam 719 to the gusset plates 721. The end plate 725
may include a first leg, at least a portion of which engages an outer surface of one of
the gusset plates 721 and extends along the vertical dimension of the gusset plate, a
connecting section extending transversely from the first leg toward the other gusset
plate 721, and a second leg extending from the connecting section, at least a portion of
which engages an outer surface of the other gusset plate 721 and extends along the
vertical dimension of the other gusset plate. The connecting section of the end plate
725 is attached in a suitable manner such as by welds 729 to the axially facing end of
the beam 719. The first and second legs of the end plate 725 are bolted to the outer
surface of respective gusset plates 721 by vertically spaced bolts 726 extending
through aligned bolt holes 726A in the first and third legs of the end plate 725 and
gusset plates 721. The bolts 726 straddle beam flanges to provide access to the bolts
from either the top or bottom of the flanges.
             [00208]              Referring to Figs. 89-92, the column assembly 713 may be fabricated
at a fabrication shop and later transported to the construction site. To fabricate the
column assembly 713, the gusset plates 721 are welded at 729 or otherwise attached
to the flanges of the column 715 and the optional horizontal shear plates 723 are
welded at 729 or otherwise attached to the web of the column and to the top and
bottom edges of the gusset plates. Any welds on the column assembly 713 needed to
form the joint can be carried out at the shop. The horizontal shear plates 723 can be
omitted from the column assembly 713. The gusset plates 721 can have other
configurations than those illustrated in the current embodiment.
             [00209]              Referring to Figs. 93-96, the full-length beam assembly 717 may also
be fabricated at a fabrication shop prior to being transported to the construction site. To
fabricate the full-length beam assembly 717, an outer surface of the connecting section
of the end plate 725 is welded at 729 or otherwise attached to the end of the beam 719.
In a preferred embodiment, the end plate 725 is groove welded to the beam 719. Any
welds on the beam assembly 717 needed to form the joint can be made at the shop.
For instance, the welds could be fillet welds or stitch welds. The end plate 725 may
have other configurations than illustrated in the current embodiment.

             [00210]              At the construction site, the column assembly 713 is joined to the full
length beam assembly 717. The column assembly 713 is first erected in a vertical
orientation and the end of the full-length beam assembly 717 is positioned horizontally
and adjacent to the column assembly. The full-length beam assembly 717 is then
moved toward the gusset plates 721 such that the first and second legs of the end plate
725 sandwich portions of the gusset plates. To fixedly secure the two assemblies 713,
717, bolts 726 are used to attach the gusset plates 721 to the end plate 725 through
aligned bolt holes 726A in the respective components. Thus, at the construction site,
the beam-to-column moment-resisting joint connection structure 711 is completed
exclusively through bolt connections. So in the field, the joint connection structure 711
is constructed without the use of welds. Some or all of the bolt holes 726A can be
oversized to reduce alignment constraints in connecting the full length beam assembly
717 to the column assembly 713.
             [00211]              Referring to Figs. 97-108, a beam-to-column moment-resisting joint
connection structure of a ninth embodiment is generally indicated at 811. In the
illustrated embodiment, the joint connection joins a column assembly 813 including a
column 815 to a full-length beam assembly 817 including a full-length beam 819.
             [00212]              A spaced apart pair of parallel, vertically and horizontally extending
gusset plates 821 sandwich the column 815 and an end portion of the beam 819. Four
optional horizontal shear plates 823 (only three are shown in Fig. 97) are arranged in
vertically spaced pairs generally aligned at top and bottom edges of the gusset plates
821 as illustrated in the previous embodiments. A first mounting plate 825 (broadly, "a
connecting member") is disposed on an axially facing end of the beam 819. The first
mounting plate 825 facilitates connection of the beam 819 to the gusset plates 821 as
will be explained in greater detail below. The first mounting plate 825 is attached in a
suitable manner such as by welds 829 to the axially facing end of the beam 819. A
second mounting plate 827 (broadly, "a connecting member) extends between the
gusset plates 821. The second mounting plate 827 is attached in a suitable manner
such as be welds 829 to the gusset plates 821.                      The first mounting plate 825 is bolted
to the second plate 827 by bolts 826 extending through aligned bolt holes 826A in the
first and second plates.                   The mounting plate 827 is attached to the gusset plates 821
such that a gap 828 is formed between the mounting plate 827 and an axially facing
end of the adjacent column flange.

             [00213]              Referring to Figs. 101-104, the column assembly 813 may be
fabricated at a fabrication shop and later transported to the construction site. To
fabricate the column assembly 813, the gusset plates 821 are welded at 829 or
otherwise attached to the flanges of the column 815, the optional horizontal shear
plates 823 are welded at 829 or otherwise attached to the web of the column and to the
top and bottom edges of the gusset plates, and the second mounting plate 827 is
welded at 829 or otherwise attached to inner surfaces of the horizontally extended
gusset plates. Any welding on the column assembly 813 needed to form the joint
connection structure can be carried out at the shop. The horizontal shear plates 823
can be omitted from the column assembly 813. The gusset plates 821 and second
mounting plate 827 can have other configurations than those illustrated in the current
embodiment.
             [00214]              Referring to Figs. 105-108, the full-length beam assembly 817 may
also be fabricated at a fabrication shop prior to being transported to the construction
site. To fabricate the full-length beam assembly 817, an inner surface of the first
mounting plate 825 is welded at 829 or otherwise attached to the end of the full-length
beam 819. Thus, at the shop, the full-length beam assembly 817 is constructed
exclusively by welds. The first mounting plate 825 may have other configurations than
illustrated in the current embodiment.
             [00215]              At the construction site, the column assembly 813 is joined to the full
length beam assembly 817. The column assembly 813 is first erected in a vertical
orientation and the end of the full-length beam assembly 817 is positioned horizontally
and adjacent to the column assembly. The full-length beam assembly 817 is then
moved either vertically up or down into position between the gusset plates 821 such
that the gusset plates are disposed on opposite sides of the beam 819 and the first and
second mounting plates 825, 827 are in opposing relation. To fixedly secure the two
assemblies 813, 817, bolts 826 are used to attach the first mounting plate 825 to the
second mounting plate 827 through aligned bolt holes 826A, 826A in the respective
components. It is possible to oversize the bolt holes 826A to reduce alignment
constraints. Thus, at the construction site, the beam-to-column moment-resisting joint
connection structure 811 is completed exclusively through bolt connections. So in the
field, the joint connection structure 811 can be constructed without the use of welds.
             [00216]              The configuration and position of the adjacent mounting plates 825,
827 and bolts 826 counteract bending moments that can be placed on the full-length

beam 819 after the building framework is erected. As previously mentioned, loads on
the building framework can cause the beam 819 to flex up and/or down generally about
a horizontal axis extending perpendicular to the length of the beam. As the beam 819
flexes up and/or down about the axis, the bolts 826 are placed in tension and/or
compression. This flexing may be cyclical. This is a result of the mounting plates 825,
827 and in particular the bolt holes 826A in the plates being arranged to receive the
bolts 826 in an orientation where the bolts extend along a length of the beam 819,
thereby acting in tension or compression to resist the bending moment applied by the
full-length beam. This is different from other joint connection structures, such as the
joint connection structures 11, 111, 211, 311, 411, 511, 611, 711 described herein that
position the bolts to extend transverse to the length of the beam, thereby acting in
shear.
             [00217]              Referring to Figs. 109-120, a beam-to-column moment-resisting joint
connection structure of a tenth embodiment is generally indicated at 911. The joint
connection structure may be used in the construction of a building framework. In the
illustrated embodiment, the joint connection joins a column assembly 913 including a
column 915 to a full-length beam assembly 917 including a full-length beam 919.
             [00218]              A spaced apart pair of parallel, vertically and horizontally extending
gusset plates 921 sandwich the column 915 and an end portion of the beam 919. Four
optional horizontal shear plates 923 (only three are shown in Fig. 109) are arranged in
vertically spaced pairs generally aligned at top and bottom edges of the gusset plates
921. Two horizontal cover plates 927A, 927B are arranged in a vertically spaced pair
sandwiching the end portion of the full-length beam 919. Bottom cover plate 927B is
optional.             Upper cover plate 927A may have a width that is greater than a width of the
 beam 919 and wider than a horizontal spacing of the gusset plates 921. Lower cover
 plate 927B may have a width that is less than the horizontal spacing between the
gusset plates 921. The configuration of the cover plates 927A, 927B allows the beam
919 to be lowered between the gusset plates 921 so that the upper cover plate 927A
 rests on the top edge of the gusset plates before fixedly securing the beam assembly
917 to column assembly 913 via the gusset plates 921 as will be explained in greater
detail below. It will be understood that the cover plates 927A, 927B may have other
widths relative to each other within the scope of the present disclosure.

gusset plate generally at a top of the gusset plate and attached to an inner surface of
the gusset plate generally at a bottom of the gusset plate. Alternately, both top and
bottom lugs may be cast as an integral part of separate longitudinal steel strip plates
(not shown) that may be individually welded or otherwise attached to the corresponding
faces of the gusset plate 921. The lugs 931A comprise cuboidal members welded at
922 to the gusset plates 921, or cast as an integral part of a longitudinal steel strip plate
which may be welded or otherwise attached to the gusset plates. The lugs 931A have
holes 933A (Fig. 116) for receiving bolts 926 as will be explained in greater detail
below. In the illustrated embodiment, a plurality of lugs 931A (three are shown) are
welded at 922 to the outer surface of each the gusset plate 921 at the top of the gusset
plate, and a plurality of lugs 931A (three) are welded at 922 to the inner surface of each
gusset plate at the bottom of the gusset plate. Each set of lugs 931A is horizontally
spaced and vertically aligned such that the holes 933A of the lugs 931A in each set are
disposed on a common axis extending along a horizontal length of the gusset plates
921.
             [00220]              Referring to Figs. 109-112 and 117-120, each cover plate 927A, 927B
may have a plurality of lugs 931 B (broadly, "connecting members") attached to a
bottom surface of the cover plate. The lugs 931 B may comprise cuboidal members
welded at 922 or otherwise attached to the cover plates 927A, 927B. If cover plate
927B is omitted, bottom lugs 931 B can be welded or otherwise attached to the bottom
face of the beam bottom flange, or may be cast as an integral part of a longitudinal
steel strip plate that is welded or otherwise attached to the bottom face of the bottom
beam flange. The lugs 931B have holes 933B (Fig. 120) for receiving the bolts 926 as
will be explained in greater detail below. In the illustrated embodiment, two sets of
three lugs 931 B are welded at 922 to opposite sides of the bottom surface of each
cover plate 927A, 927B. Each set of three lugs 931 B is horizontally spaced along a
length of the cover plate 927A, 927B and aligned such that the holes 933B of the lugs
931 B in each set are disposed on a common axis extending along the length of the
respective cover plate 927A, 927B and along a length of the beam 919. The cover
plates 927A, 927B are welded at 929 or otherwise attached to respective upper and
lower flanges of the beam 919.
             [00221]              Referring to Fig. 113, the column assembly 913 may be fabricated at a
fabrication shop and later transported to the construction site. To fabricate the column
assembly 913, the gusset plates 921 are welded at 929 or otherwise attached to the
                                                             34

flanges of the column 915 and the horizontal shear plates 923 are welded at 929 or
otherwise attached to the web of the column and to the top and bottom edges of the
gusset plates. Any welding needed on the column assembly 913 to form the beam-to
column joint may be carried out by the shop. The horizontal shear plates 923 can be
omitted from the column assembly 913. The gusset plates 921 and lugs 931A can
have other configurations than those illustrated in the current embodiment. Moreover,
the number of lugs 931A can be other than three.
             [00222]              Prior to attaching the gusset plates 921 to the column 915, the lugs
931A are secured to the gusset plates. The lugs 131A are secured to the gusset plates
921 by welding at 922 each individual lug directly to the surface of the gusset plate as
shown in the illustrated embodiment. Alternatively, the lugs 931A can be grouped using
a common cast steel strip plate (not shown). Still further, the lugs 931A can be
modularly set in place on a longitudinal steel strip plate (not shown) and welded to the
plate. The longitudinal steel strip plate can then be welded or otherwise attached to the
gusset plate 921. This provides a greater weld surface area for a more secure weld
and may allow for greater accuracy in placement of the lugs 931A. The lugs 931A may
also be secured to the gusset plates 921 by casting the lugs with the gusset plates.
Other means of securing the lugs 931A to the gusset plates 921 are envisioned.
             [00223]              Referring to Fig. 117, the full-length beam assembly 917 may be
fabricated at a fabrication shop prior to being transported to the construction site. To
fabricate the full-length beam assembly 917, the cover plates 927A, 927B are welded at
929 or otherwise attached to the upper and lower flanges, respectively, of the full-length
beam 919. Any welding needed on the full-length beam assembly 917 to form the joint
may be carried out at the shop. The cover plates 927A, 927B may have other
configurations than those illustrated in the current embodiment.
             [00224]              Prior to attaching the cover plates 927A, 927B to the full-length beam
919, the lugs 931 B are secured to the cover plates. The lugs 931 B are secured to the
cover plates 927A, 927B by welding at 922 or otherwise attaching each individual lug
directly to the surface of the cover plate as shown in the illustrated embodiment.
Alternatively, the lugs 931 B can be modularly set in place on a longitudinal steel strip
plate (not shown) and welded or otherwise attached to the plate, which can then be
welded to the cover plates 927A, 927B. As mentioned above, this provides a greater
weld surface area for a more secure weld and potentially more accurate location of the
lugs 931 B. The lugs 931 B may also be secured to the cover plates 927A, 927B by
                                                             35

casting the lugs with the cover plates. If cover plate 927B is omitted, the lugs 931 B can
be cast as an integral part of a longitudinal steel strip plate that may be welded or
otherwise attached to the corresponding top or bottom beam flange. Other means of
securing the lugs 931 B to the cover plates 927A, 927B are envisioned
             [00225]              At the construction site, the column assembly 913 is joined to the full
length beam assembly 917. The column assembly 913 is first erected in a vertical
orientation and the end of the full-length beam assembly 917 is positioned adjacent the
column assembly, over the gusset plates 921. The full-length beam assembly 917 is
then lowered between the gusset plates 921 until the bottom surface of the upper cover
plate 927A engages the upper edges of the gusset plates. This engagement
temporarily locates and supports the full-length beam assembly 917 on the column
assembly 913. When the beam assembly 917 is lowered into engagement with the
column assembly 913, the lugs 931 B on the cover plates 927A, 927B are located
adjacent to respective lugs 931A on the gusset plates 921 so that the holes 933A, 933B
in the lugs 931A, 931 B, respectively, are aligned. To fixedly secure the two assemblies
913, 917, bolts 926 are inserted through the aligned holes 933A, 933B in the respective
components. The holes 933B in the lugs 931 B are oversized to facilitate threading the
bolt 926 through holes 931B and 931A, and to ensure that bolts 926 can only act in
tension or compression and thus provide higher both capacity. It will be understood
that it could be the holes 933A in the lugs 931A that are oversized. Thus, at the
construction site, the joint connection structure 911 is completed exclusively through
bolt connections. So in the field, the joint connection structure 911 is constructed
without the use of welds.
             [00226]              The configuration and position of the lugs 931A, 931B and bolts 926
counteract bending moments that can be placed on the full-length beam 919 after the
building framework is erected. Loads on the building framework can cause the beam
919 to flex up and/or down generally about a horizontal axis extending perpendicular to
the length of the beam. As the beam 919 flexes up and/or down about the horizontal
axis, the bolts 926 are placed in tension and/or compression. This loading may be
cyclical. This is a result of the holes 933A, 933B of the lugs 931A, 931B, respectively,
being arranged to receive the bolts 926 in an orientation where the bolts extend along a
length of the beam 919. This is unlike other bolted joint connection structures of the
current disclosure, such as the joint connection structures 11, 111, 211, 311, 411, 511,
611, 711 described herein, which positions the bolts to extend transverse to the length
                                                              36

of the beam, so that the bolts are loaded in shear thereby minimizing the load capacity
of the bolts. In contrast, in the current embodiment the loading in bolts 926 occurs in
tension or compression, which maximizes the capacity of the bolts, allowing a fewer
number of bolts to be employed. It is also envisioned that bearings (not shown) instead
of lugs can be used.
             [00227]              Referring to Figs. 121-132, a beam-to-column moment-resisting joint
connection structure of an eleventh embodiment is generally indicated at 1011. The
joint connection structure may be used in the construction of a building framework. In
the illustrated embodiment, the joint connection joins a column assembly 1013 including
a column 1015 to a full-length beam assembly 1017 including a full-length beam 1019.
             [00228]              A spaced apart pair of parallel, vertically and horizontally extending
gusset plates 1021 sandwich the column 1015 and beam 1019. Four horizontal shear
 plates 1023 (only three are shown in Fig. 121) are arranged in vertically spaced pairs
generally aligned at top and bottom edges of the gusset plates 1021. Vertical shear
 plates 1028 are welded at 1029 to a web of the beam 1019 and bolted to the gusset
 plates 1021 by way of vertical angle irons 1025 attached to the vertical shear plates.
The vertical angle irons 1025 are L-shaped in vertical plan view. Each vertical angle
 iron 1025 may include a vertically extending first leg welded to the a corresponding
vertical shear plate 1028 and a second vertically extending leg projecting perpendicular
to the first leg along the length of the beam.                  An outer surface of the second leg of
each angle iron 1025 is bolted to an inner surface of a respective gusset plate 1021 by
vertically spaced bolts 1026 extending through aligned bolt holes 1026A in the second
 leg of the angle iron and respective gusset plate. A horizontal cover plate 1027 is
 located on a top surface of an upper flange of the beam 1019 and is attached in a
suitable manner as by welding to tips of the upper flange. Cover plate 1027 may have
a width that is greater than a width of the beam 1019 and greater than a horizontal
spacing of the gusset plates 1021. Lower angle irons 1033are each attached in a
suitable manner such as by welds 1029 to a bottom surface of a lower flange of the
 beam 1019 and to a tip of the lower flange. The spacing between laterally outwardly
facing surfaces of vertical legs of the angle irons 1033 is less than the horizontal
spacing between the gusset plates 1021. The configuration of the cover plate 1027 and
angle irons 1033 allows the beam 1019 to be lowered between the gusset plates 1021
so that the cover plate 1027 rests on the top edge of the gusset plates before fixedly
securing the beam assembly 1017 to column assembly 1013 via the gusset plates 1021

as will be explained in greater detail below. It will be understood that the other sizes
and arrangements of the cover plate 1027 and angle irons 1033 are possible. For
example, the angle irons 1033 can be attached to a lower cover plate (not shown) that
is attached to the lower flange of the beam 1019.
             [00229]              Referring to Figs. 121-128, each gusset plate 1021 may have an
upper angle iron 1031 (broadly, "an upper connecting member") attached to an outer
surface of the gusset plate. The upper angle iron 1031 may comprise an elongate L
shaped member including a vertical first leg attached to the outer surface of the gusset
plate at an upper portion of the gusset plate and extending horizontally along the upper
portion of the gusset plate. The first leg of each upper angle iron 1031 may be welded
or otherwise attached to the outer surface of the respective gusset plate 1021.                  A
horizontal second leg of the upper angle iron 1031 may project transversely from the
first leg of the upper angle iron and laterally away from the gusset plate 1021 and away
from the beam 1019. In the illustrated embodiment, the first and second legs of the
upper angle irons 1031 are disposed at substantially a right angle to each other. A top
surface of the second leg of each upper angle iron 1031 is bolted to a bottom surface
the cover plate 1027 by horizontally spaced bolts 1026 extending through aligned bolt
holes 1026A in the second leg of the upper angle irons and upper cover plate. In the
illustrated embodiment, the upper angle irons 1031 are configured such that the lateral
edge of the second legs are flush with the lateral edges of the cover plate 1027 (Fig.
124). Further, the top surface of the second leg of the upper angle irons 1031 are
above the top edge of the gusset plates 1021. In another embodiment, the second leg
of at least one of the upper angle irons 1031' may extend laterally past a lateral edge of
the cover plate 1027 (Fig. 133). This configuration of the upper angle iron 1031' may
provide a support surface for a component such as a metal floor decking 1035 to rest
on top of the upper angle iron. The upper angle irons 1031, 1031' may be otherwise
configured and/or arranged within the scope of the present invention.
             [00230]              Referring to Figs. 129-132, the lower angle irons 1033 (broadly,
"lower connecting members") comprise elongate L-shaped members including a first
leg attached to the bottom surface lower flange of the beam 1019 at opposite side
portions of the lower flange and extending horizontally along the side portions. The
first leg of each lower angle iron 1033 may be welded or otherwise attached to the
bottom surface of the lower flange of the beam 1019. Each lower angle iron 1033 may
also include a second leg projecting transversely from the first leg of the lower angle
                                                            38

iron and downward, away from the lower flange. In the illustrated embodiment, the first
and second legs of each lower angle iron 1033 are disposed at substantially a right
angle to each other. An outer surface of the second leg of each lower angle iron 1033
is bolted to an inner surface of a respective gusset plate 1021 by horizontally spaced
bolts 1026 extending through aligned bolt holes 1026A in the second leg of the lower
angle iron and the gusset plate. The bolt holes 1026A in the various components may
be slotted as shown in the first embodiment to facilitate alignment. Other arrangements
to reduce alignment constraints are possible. Referring to Fig. 129-132, the full-length
beam assembly 1017 may be fabricated at a fabrication shop prior to being transported
to the construction site. To fabricate the full-length beam assembly 1017, the angle
irons 1025 are welded or otherwise attached to the web of the beam 1019, the cover
plate 1027 is welded or otherwise attached to the upper flange of the beam, and the
lower angle irons 1033 are welded or otherwise attached to the lower flange of the
beam. Thus, at the shop, the full-length beam assembly 1017 is constructed
exclusively by welds. The angle irons 1025, cover plate 1027 and lower angle iron
1033 may have other configurations than those illustrated in the current embodiment.
             [00231]              Referring to Fig. 125-128, the column assembly 1013 may also be
fabricated at a fabrication shop and later transported to the construction site. To
fabricate the column assembly 1013, the gusset plates 1021 are welded or otherwise
attached to the flanges of the column 1015, the horizontal sheer plates 1023 are
welded or otherwise attached to the web of the column and to the top and bottom
edges of the gusset plates, and the upper angle arms 1031 are welded or otherwise
attached to the gusset plates. Thus, at the shop, the column assembly 1013 is
constructed exclusively by welds. The horizontal sheer plates 1023 can be omitted
from the column assembly 1013. The gusset plates 1021 and upper angle irons 1031
can have other configurations than those illustrated in the current embodiment.
             [00232]              At the construction site, the column assembly 1013 is joined to the full
length beam assembly 1017. The column assembly 1013 is first erected in a vertical
orientation and the end of the full-length beam assembly 1017 is positioned adjacent
the column assembly, over the gusset plates 1021. The full-length beam assembly
1017 is then lowered between the gusset plates 1021 until the bottom surface of the
cover plate 1027 engages the top surface of the second leg of the upper angle irons
1031. This engagement temporarily locates and supports the full-length beam
assembly 1017 on the column assembly 1013. To fixedly secure the two assemblies
                                                              39

1013, 1017, bolts 1026 are used to attach the upper angle irons 1031 to the cover plate
1027, the lower angle irons 1033 to the gusset plates 1021, and the vertical angle irons
1025 to the gusset plates through aligned bolt holes 1026A in the respective
components. Thus, at the construction site, the joint connection structure 1011 is
completed exclusively through bolt connections. So in the field, the joint connection
structure 1011 is constructed without the use of welds.
             [00233]              Referring to Figs. 134-136, a beam-to-column moment-resisting joint
connection structure of a twelfth embodiment is generally indicated at 1111. In the
illustrated embodiment, the joint connection joins a column assembly 1113 including a
column 1115 to a full-length beam assembly 1117 including a full-length beam 1119.
The joint connection structure 1111 of the twelfth embodiment is substantially identical
to the joint connection structure 11 of the first embodiment. The primary difference
between the two embodiments is gusset plates 1121 are bolted to the column 1115. In
particular, a pair of vertical angle irons 11 24A are welded at 1129 to each flange 1116
of the column 1115 (only three can be seen in the Figures) and a pair of horizontal
angle irons 11 24B are welded at 1129 to opposite sides of the web of the column (only
two ). The vertical angle irons 1124A are elongate L-shaped members. Each vertical
angle iron 11 24A may include a vertically extending first leg welded to the a flange
1116 of the column 1115 and a second vertically extending leg projecting perpendicular
to the first leg transverse to the length of the column.                An outer surface of the second
leg of each vertical angle iron 11 24A is bolted to an inner surface of a respective gusset
plate 1121 by vertically spaced bolts 1126 extending through aligned bolt holes in the
second leg of the vertical bracket and respective gusset plate.
             [00234]              The horizontal angle irons 1124B are also elongate L-shaped
members. Each horizontal angle iron 11 24B may include a horizontally extending first
leg welded to a web of the column 1115 and a second horizontally extending leg
projecting perpendicular to the first leg along the length of the column.                An outer
surface of the second leg of each horizontal angle iron 1124B is bolted to an inner
surface of a respective gusset plate 1121 by vertically spaced bolts 1126 extending
through aligned bolt holes in the second leg of the horizontal angle iron and respective
gusset plate. The angle irons 11 24A, 11 24B can have other configurations without
departing from the scope of the disclosure.
             [00235]              Referring to Figs. 137-139, a beam-to-column moment-resisting joint
connection structure of a thirteenth embodiment is generally indicated at 1211. In the
                                                            40

illustrated embodiment, the joint connection joins a column assembly 1213 including a
column 1215 to a full-length beam assembly 1217 including a full-length beam 1219.
The joint connection structure 1211 of the thirteenth embodiment is substantially
identical to the joint connection structure 1111 of the twelfth embodiment except vertical
brackets 1224A are rectangular plate members rather than angle irons 1124A.
However, brackets 1224A, 1224B can have other configurations without departing from
the scope of the disclosure.
             [00236]              It will be understood that the specific connections described in each of
the embodiments are interchangeable.
