                                       RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]       The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent Application No.
2013406056, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                         TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]       Embodiments of the present invention relate to the field of communications technologies,
and in particular, to a signal transmission method, user equipment, and a base station.
                                            BACKGROUND
[0003]       In a Long Term Evolution (Long Term Evolution, LTE) or Long Term Evolution
Advanced (LTE Advanced, LTE-A) system, user equipment (User Equipment, UE) generally has
different values of a feature parameter at different moments. Herein, the feature parameter of the
UE refers to: a value or information used to measure quality of communication between the UE and
a base station, and/or a value or information used to measure quality of a channel between the UE
and a base station, and/or information used to reflect a service feature of the UE.
[0004]       For example, when the UE communicates with the base station under a poor channel
condition at a particular moment, greater coverage enhancement is required for signal transmission
between the UE and the base station; in this case, more resource overheads may be used to improve
reliability of service transmission. When the channel condition is good, less coverage enhancement
is required for signal transmission between the UE and the base station; in this case, reliable service
transmission can be performed by using fewer resource overheads. However, in the prior art, for
example, when coverage enhancement is performed for signal transmission between the UE and the
base station, a current coverage enhancement value is not considered; instead, a uniform coverage
enhancement technology is used to perform coverage enhancement. Besides, during coverage
enhancement, the UE or the base station may support transmission of same signals, and support
same functions of the signals.
[0005]       That is, in the prior art, when the feature parameter of the UE changes, the UE or the
                                                     I

base station uses a uniform coverage enhancement technology to perform coverage enhancement,
supports transmitting same signals, and supports same functions of the signals, which produces a
large quantity of system resource overheads, results in low resource utilization, and increases
complexity of service processing by the UE or the base station. Therefore, it is necessary to provide
a new method to resolve the foregoing problem.
[0006]      A reference herein to a patent document or any other matter identified as prior art, is not
to be taken as an admission that the document or other matter was known or that the information it
contains was part of the common general knowledge as at the priority date of any of the claims.
[0007]      Where any or all of the terms "comprise", "comprises", "comprised" or "comprising" are
used in this specification (including the claims) they are to be interpreted as specifying the presence
of the stated features, integers, steps or components, but not precluding the presence of one or more
other features, integers, steps or components.

             the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the

supports a function in a first function set of the third signal, and if the feature parameter belongs to
the second feature parameter set, the base station supports using a function in a second function set
of the third signal, where the function in the first function set and the function in the second

                               DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0078]      The following describes the technical solutions in the embodiments of the present
invention with reference to the accompanying drawings in the embodiments of the present invention.
Apparently, the described embodiments are merely some but not all of the embodiments of the
present invention. All other embodiments obtained by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on
the embodiments of the present invention without creative efforts shall fall within the protection
scope of the present invention.
[0079]      The embodiments of the present invention provide a signal transmission method, user
                                                    23

equipment, and a base station. The embodiments of the present invention can optimize resource
utilization of a system, decrease processing complexity, and reduce power consumption.
[0080]       Referring to FIG. 1, FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of UE in the present invention, and UE
100 of this embodiment includes:
             a first determining unit 101, configured to determine a feature parameter of the UE,
where the feature parameter of the UE refers to: a value or information used to measure
communication quality of the UE, and/or a value or information used to measure channel quality of
the UE, and/or information used to reflect a service feature of the UE; and
             a first processing unit 102, configured to: according to the feature parameter of the UE
and a preset correspondence, determine a coverage enhancement technology used by the UE to
transmit a first signal, and/or determine a second signal that the UE supports transmitting, and/or
determine a function, supported by the UE, of a third signal.
[0081]       For ease of comprehension, the following describes, by using an actual application
scenario, an interaction manner between the units of the UE 100 in this embodiment:
[0082]       First, the first determining unit 101 determines a feature parameter of the UE, where the
feature parameter of the UE refers to a value or information used to measure communication quality
of the UE, and/or a value or information used to measure channel quality of the UE, and/or
information used to reflect a service feature of the UE.
[0083]       Specifically, the feature parameter of the UE may include at least one of the following: a
resource, a resource index, a level, a level index, an enhancement level, an enhancement level index,
a repetition level, a repetition level index, a quantity of repetition times, an index of a quantity of
repetition times, a coverage enhancement value, an index of a coverage enhancement range, a path
loss value, an index of a path loss range, a reference signal received power value, an index of a
reference signal received power range, a reference signal received quality value, an index of a
reference signal received quality range, a channel quality information value, an index of a channel
quality information range, a service type, an index of a service type, a power saving requirement, an
index of a power saving requirement, a delay requirement, an index of a delay requirement, a
quantity of times of detecting a pre-specified channel, an index of a quantity of times of detecting a
pre-specified channel, a mobility requirement, and an index of a mobility requirement.
[0084]       The first determining unit 101 may determine the feature parameter of the UE according
to received signaling that indicates the feature parameter of the UE, where the signaling may be sent
by another UE to the UE of this embodiment, or may be sent by a base station or another network
entity to the UE. Alternatively, the first determining unit 101 determines the feature parameter of
the UE according to whether a downlink signal can be correctly received. For example, the UE
                                                    24

sends an uplink signal to a base station, and if the UE can correctly receive a corresponding
downlink signal that is fed back by the base station, the first determining unit 101 can determine a
current feature parameter of the UE (for example, a feature parameter that represents current
communication quality). More specifically, when the feature parameter is an enhancement level
index (or a repetition level index, a repetition level, or an enhancement level), the uplink signal is a
physical random access channel PRACH, and the downlink signal is a random access response, if
the UE successfully receives the random access response or successfully completes a random access
process after repeatedly sending the PRACH r times on a PRACH resource (a time resource, and/or
a frequency resource, and/or a codeword resource) corresponding to the enhancement level index
(or the repetition level index, the repetition level, or the enhancement level) x according to a
quantity r of PRACH repetition times that is corresponding to the enhancement level index (or the
repetition level index, the repetition level, or the enhancement level) x, the UE determines that the
feature parameter of the UE is the enhancement level index (or the repetition level index, the
repetition level, or the enhancement level) x. Alternatively, the first determining unit 101 determines
the feature parameter of the UE by measuring a received downlink signal. Specifically, the UE may
determine the feature parameter of the UE by measuring a reference signal, a synchronization signal,
or a physical broadcast channel. Alternatively, the first determining unit 101 determines the feature
parameter of the UE autonomously.
[0085]      After the first determining unit 101 determines the feature parameter of the UE,
according to the feature parameter of the UE and a preset correspondence, the first processing unit
102 determines a coverage enhancement technology used by the UE to transmit a first signal, and/or
determines a second signal that the UE supports transmitting, and/or determines a function,
supported by the UE, of a third signal.
[0086]      In this embodiment, the preset correspondence may be a preset function relationship, a
preset table relationship, or a preset specification relationship, and the preset correspondence may
be preconfigured by a base station by using signaling or may be preset by a system by using a
standard protocol.
[0087]      The preset correspondence       refers to a preset correspondence between a feature
parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal, a preset
correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported,
and a preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third
signal.
[0088]       Specifically, the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal may be: if the feature parameter is
                                                    25

less than or equal to a feature parameter threshold, the UE uses a first coverage enhancement
technology to transmit the first signal, and if the feature parameter is greater than the feature
parameter threshold, the UE uses a second coverage enhancement technology to transmit the first
signal, where both the first coverage enhancement technology and the second coverage
enhancement technology are technologies for improving signal transmission reliability, and a main
difference between the two lies in that they can implement different converge enhancement
intensities.
[0089]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which
transmission is supported may be: if the feature parameter is less than or equal to the feature
parameter threshold, the UE supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1, and if the feature
parameter is greater than the feature parameter threshold, the UE supports transmitting a second
signal in a signal set 2, where the second signal in the signal set 1 and the second signal in the
signal set 2 are different, and the difference herein mainly refers to that the signal set 1 and the
second set 2 include different types of second signals, but the signal set 1 and the second set 2 may
include a same quantity of or different quantities of second signals.
[0090]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the
third signal may be: if the feature parameter is less than or equal to the feature parameter threshold,
the UE supports using a function in a first function set of the third signal, and if the feature
parameter is greater than the feature parameter threshold, the UE supports using a function in a
second function set of the third signal, where the function in the first function set and the function in
the second function set are not completely the same.
[0091]       Besides, the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal may also be: if the feature parameter
belongs to a first feature parameter set, the UE uses a first coverage enhancement technology to
transmit the first signal, and if the feature parameter belongs to a second feature parameter set, the
UE uses a second coverage enhancement technology to transmit the first signal, where both the first
coverage     enhancement technology and the second coverage enhancement technology                    are
technologies for improving signal transmission reliability, and a main difference between the two
lies in that they can implement different converge enhancement intensities.
[0092]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which
transmission is supported may also be: if the feature parameter belongs to the first feature parameter
set, the UE supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1, and if the feature parameter
belongs to the second feature parameter set, the UE supports transmitting a second signal in a signal
set 2, where the second signal in the signal set 1 and the second signal in the signal set 2 are
                                                   26

different, and the difference herein mainly refers to that the signal set 1 and the second set 2 include
different types of second signals, but the signal set 1 and the second set 2 may include a same
quantity of or different quantities of second signals.
[0093]      The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the
third signal may also be: if the feature parameter belongs to the first feature parameter set, the UE
supports a function in a first function set of the third signal, and if the feature parameter belongs to
the second feature parameter set, the UE supports using a function in a second function set of the
third signal, where the function in the first function set and the function in the second function set
are not completely the same.
[0094]      The foregoing feature parameter threshold, signal set 1, signal set 2, first function set,
second function set, first feature parameter set, and second feature parameter set may be
preconfigured by the base station by using signaling or may be preset by the system by using a
standard protocol.
[0095]      For example, the signal set 2 includes fewer signal types than the signal set 1. The signal
set 1 or the signal set 2 may be an empty set. The signal set 1 and the signal set 2 may include
completely different signals, and in this case, if the UE supports transmission of a signal in the
signal set 2, it indicates that the UE does not support transmission of a signal in the signal set 1. The
signal set 1 or the signal set 2 includes one or more types of the following signals: a physical
downlink control channel, an enhanced physical downlink control channel, a physical random
access channel, a physical control format indicator channel, a physical hybrid automatic repeat
request indicator channel, a unicast physical downlink shared channel, a broadcast or multicast
physical downlink shared channel, a physical uplink shared channel, a physical uplink control
channel, a synchronization channel, a physical broadcast channel, a common reference signal, a
demodulation reference signal, a dedicated reference signal, a random access response message, a
random access response acknowledgment message, a contention resolution message, system
information, and a paging message.
[0096]      In addition, the first function set includes a larger quantity of functions than the second
function set. Specifically, for example, the third signal is a PUCCH, and the first function set and
the second function set include one or more of the following functions: a function of reporting
channel quality information, a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back an
acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received; however, the second function
set includes a smaller quantity of functions than the first function set.
[0097]      After the first determining unit 101 determines the feature parameter of the UE, the first
processing unit 102 may determine, according to the preset correspondence between a feature
                                                    27

parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal, a
coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal and that corresponds to the
feature parameter of the UE; and/or
             the first processing unit 102 determines, according to the preset correspondence between
a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported, a second signal          to
which the feature parameter of the UE corresponds, wherein transmission of the second signal is
supported by the feature parameter; and/or
             the first processing unit 102 determines, according to the preset correspondence between
a feature parameter and a supported function of the third signal, a supported function that is
corresponding to the feature parameter of the UE and is of the third signal.
[0098]       The first signal, the second signal, and the third signal herein may be the same or may be
different. That is, the first signal and the second signal may be the same or may be different; the
first signal and the third signal may be the same or may be different; and the second signal and the
third signal may be the same or may be different.
[0099]       The first signal, the second signal, or the third signal includes at least one of the
following:
             a physical downlink control channel, an enhanced physical downlink control channel, a
physical random access channel, a physical control format indicator channel, a physical hybrid
automatic repeat request indicator channel, a unicast physical downlink shared channel, a broadcast
or multicast physical downlink shared channel, a physical uplink shared channel, a physical uplink
control channel, a synchronization channel, a physical broadcast channel, a common reference
signal, a demodulation reference signal, a dedicated reference signal, a random access response
message, a random access response acknowledgment message, a contention resolution message,
system information, and a paging message.
[00100]      The "transmission" in this embodiment refers to sending or receiving. The "transmit" in
this embodiment refers to send or receive.
[00101]      By using an example in which the feature parameter of the UE is a coverage
enhancement value, the following describes determining, by the UE according to the feature
parameter of the UE and the preset correspondence, the coverage enhancement technology used by
the UE to transmit the first signal, and/or determining the second signal that the UE supports
transmitting, and/or determining the function, supported by the UE, of the third signal.
[00102]      For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to
transmit the first signal is: when a coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and
                                                     28

less than or equal to X dB), a first coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit the first
signal; when the coverage enhancement value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X
dB and less than or equal to Y dB), a second coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit
the first signal. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature threshold.
[0100]        If the first determining unit 101 determines that a coverage enhancement value of the UE
is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the first processing unit 102
determines, according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal, that the first coverage enhancement
technology is used to transmit the first signal. If the first determining unit 101 determines that the
coverage enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and
less than or equal to Y dB), the first processing unit 102 determines, according to the
correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to
transmit the first signal, that the second coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit the
first signal.
[0101]        In this embodiment, the first coverage enhancement technology and the second coverage
enhancement technology may be one of or a combination of multiple of the following technologies:
retransmission, spread spectrum transmission, low bit-rate transmission, transmission time interval
bundling (TTI bundling) transmission, power boosting (power boosting), power spectrum density
boosting (PSD boosting), keep trying (keep trying), relaxing requirement, frequency hopping, and
maximum likelihood detection.
[0102]        More specifically, for example, the first signal is a physical uplink control channel
PUCCH, and the base station or the system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement
value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB, the relaxing requirement (and/or
frequency hopping) is used to perform PUCCH coverage enhancement; when the coverage
enhancement value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), the
relaxing requirement (and/or frequency hopping) and repeated transmission are used to perform
PUCCH coverage enhancement. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold.
For example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If the coverage enhancement value
determined by the first determining unit 101 is 3 dB, that is, the coverage enhancement value is less
than 5 dB, the first processing unit 102 determines that the relaxing requirement (and/or frequency
hopping) is used to perform PUCCH coverage enhancement for the PUCCH. If the coverage
enhancement value determined by the first determining unit 101 is 8 dB, that is, the coverage
enhancement value is greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB (or is greater than 5 dB), the first
processing unit 102 determines that the relaxing requirement (and/or frequency hopping) and
                                                     29

repeated transmission are used to perform PUCCH coverage enhancement for the PUCCH.
[0103]      Specifically, for another example, the first signal is a physical broadcast channel PBCH,
and the base station or the system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement value is C
dB, keep trying is used to perform PBCH coverage enhancement; when the coverage enhancement
value is D dB, keep trying and retransmission are used to perform PBCH coverage enhancement.
Herein, C and/or D are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in
advance that C=10, and D=15. If the first determining unit 101 determines that the coverage
enhancement value is 10 dB, the first processing unit 102 determines that keep trying is used to
perform PBCH coverage enhancement for the PBCH, and the first processing unit 102 keeps trying
PBCH detection to detect the PBCH. If the first determining unit 101 determines that the coverage
enhancement value is 15 dB, the first processing unit 102 determines that keep trying and
retransmission are used to perform PBCH coverage enhancement for the PBCH, and the first
processing unit 102 keeps trying repetition of PBCH detection to detect the PBCH.
[0104]      For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported is:
when a coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB),
the UE supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1; when the coverage enhancement
value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the
UE supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 2. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined
feature threshold.
[0105]      If the first determining unit 101 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the
UE is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the first processing unit 102
determines, according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of
which transmission is supported, that transmission of the second signal in the signal set 1 is
supported. If the first determining unit 101 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the
UE is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the first
processing unit 102 determines, according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a
second signal of which transmission is supported, that transmission of the second signal in the
signal set 2 is supported.
[0106]      More specifically, for example, the second signal in the transmission signal set 1 is a
PBCH and a physical hybrid automatic repeat request indicator channel PHICH, and the second
signal in the transmission signal set 2 is a PBCH. The base station or the system specifies in
advance: when a coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB,
transmission of the second signal in the signal set 1 is supported; when the coverage enhancement
                                                   30

value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), transmission of
the second signal in the signal set 2 is supported. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature
parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If the coverage
enhancement value determined by the first determining unit 101 is 3 dB, that is, the coverage
enhancement value is less than 5 dB, the first processing unit 102 determines that the PBCH and
PHICH can be supported. If the coverage enhancement value determined by the first determining
unit 101 is 8 dB, that is, the coverage enhancement value is greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB,
the first processing unit 102 determines that the PBCH is supported, that is, the first processing unit
102 determines that the PHICH is not supported.
[0107]       Specifically, for another example, the second signal in the transmission signal set 1 is a
PUCCH (or a PHICH), and the second signal in the transmission signal set 2 is a null signal, that is,
the transmission signal set 2 does not include any signal. The base station or the system specifies in
advance: when a coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB,
transmission of the second signal in the signal set 1 is supported; when the coverage enhancement
value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), transmission of
the second signal in the signal set 2 is supported. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature
parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If a coverage
enhancement value of UE 1 is 3 dB, the UE 1 determines that the coverage enhancement value of
the UE 1 is less than 5 dB, and therefore, the UE 1 determines that the PUCCH (or the PHICH) can
be supported. If the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is 8 dB, the UE 1 determines that the
coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB (or is greater than
5 dB), and the UE 1 determines that transmission of the signal in the signal set 1 is not supported,
that is, UE 2 determines that the PUCCH (or the PHICH) is not supported.
[0108]       For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third signal is: when a
coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the
UE supports a function in a first function set of the third signal; when the coverage enhancement
value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the
UE supports a function in a second function of the third signal. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a
predefined feature threshold.
[0109]       If the first determining unit 101 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the
UE is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the first processing unit 102
determines, according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function
of the third signal, that the function in the first function set of the third signal is supported. If the
                                                    31

first determining unit 101 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or is
greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the first processing unit
102 determines, according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported
function of the third signal, that the function in the second function set of the third signal is
supported.
[0110]       More specifically, for example, the third signal is a PUCCH. The base station or the
system specifies in advance that functions in a first function set of the PUCCH include a function of
reporting channel quality information, a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back
an acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received; functions in a second
function set of the PUCCH include a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back an
acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received. Besides, the base station or the
system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than
or equal to X dB, the functions in the first function set of the third signal are supported; when the
coverage enhancement value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than
X dB), the functions in the second function set of the third signal are supported. Herein, X and/or Y
are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in advance that X=5,
and Y=10. If the coverage enhancement value determined by the first determining unit 101 is 3 dB,
that is, the coverage enhancement value is less than 5 dB, the first processing unit 102 determines
that the following functions of the PUCCH are supported: the function of reporting channel quality
information, the scheduling request function, and the function of feeding back an acknowledgement
indicating whether a signal is correctly received. If the coverage enhancement value determined by
the first determining unit 101 is 8 dB, that is, the coverage enhancement value is greater than 5 dB
and less than 10 dB (or is greater than 5 dB), the first processing unit 102 determines that the
scheduling request function and the function of feeding back an acknowledgement indicating
whether a signal is correctly received of the PUCCH are supported.
[0111]       It should be noted that the foregoing description of method implementation of this
embodiment is provided by using an example in which the feature parameter is a coverage
enhancement value. When the feature parameter is a level, a level index, a quantity of repetition
times, an index of a quantity of repetition times, a resource, a resource index, an enhancement level,
an enhancement level index, or other information (which reflects communication quality, channel
quality, or a service feature), implementation of this embodiment may be performed similarly
according to the foregoing description, and details are not described herein again.
[0112]       In this embodiment, according to a current feature parameter of UE and a preset
correspondence, a first processing unit may adaptively determine a coverage enhancement
                                                    32

technology used to transmit a first signal between the UE and a base station, and/or determine a
second signal of which transmission is supported between the UE and a base station, and/or
determine a supported function of a third signal, thereby adapting to different feature parameters, so
as to optimize resource utilization of a system, decrease processing complexity, and reduce power
consumption.
[0113]       The following describes a base station provided by an embodiment of the present
invention. Referring to FIG. 2, a base station 200 of this embodiment includes:
             a second determining unit 201, configured to determine a feature parameter of UE,
where the feature parameter of the UE refers to: a value or information used to measure
communication quality of the UE, and/or a value or information used to measure channel quality of
the UE, and/or information used to reflect a service feature of the UE; and
             a second processing unit 202, configured to: according to the feature parameter of the
UE and a preset correspondence, determine a coverage enhancement technology used by the base
station to transmit a first signal, and/or determine a second signal that the base station supports
transmitting, and/or determine a function, supported by the base station, of a third signal.
[0114]       For ease of comprehension, the following describes, by using an actual application
scenario, an interaction manner between the units of the base station 200 in this embodiment:
[0115]       The UE in this embodiment refers to one or more UEs that communicate with the base
station 200. For the purpose of simplicity, the UE in the following refers to one UE.
[0116]       First, the second determining unit 201 determines a feature parameter of UE, where the
feature parameter of the UE refers to a value or information used to measure communication quality
of the UE, and/or a value or information used to measure channel quality of the UE, and/or
information used to reflect a service feature of the UE.
[0117]       Specifically, the feature parameter of the UE may include at least one of the following: a
resource, a resource index, a level, a level index, an enhancement level, an enhancement level index,
a repetition level, a repetition level index, a quantity of repetition times, an index of a quantity of
repetition times, a coverage enhancement value, an index of a coverage enhancement range, a path
loss value, an index of a path loss range, a reference signal received power value, an index of a
reference signal received power range, a reference signal received quality value, an index of a
reference signal received quality range, a channel quality information value, an index of a channel
quality information range, a service type, an index of a service type, a power saving requirement, an
index of a power saving requirement, a delay requirement, an index of a delay requirement, a
quantity of times of detecting a pre-specified channel, an index of a quantity of times of detecting a
pre-specified channel, a mobility requirement, and an index of a mobility requirement.
                                                    33

[0118]      The second determining unit 201 may determine the feature parameter of the UE
according to received signaling that indicates the feature parameter of the UE, where the signaling
may be sent by the UE or another network entity to the base station. Alternatively, the second
determining unit 201 determines the feature parameter of the UE according to whether an uplink
signal can be correctly received. For example, the base station sends a downlink signal to the UE,
and if the base station can correctly receive a corresponding uplink signal that is fed back by the UE,
the second determining unit 201 can determine a current feature parameter of the UE (for example,
a feature parameter that represents current communication quality). Alternatively, the second
determining unit 201 determines the feature parameter of the UE by measuring a received uplink
signal. Alternatively, the second determining unit 201 determines the feature parameter of the UE
autonomously.
[0119]      After the second determining unit 201 determines the feature parameter of the UE,
according to the feature parameter of the UE and a preset correspondence, the second processing
unit 202 determines a coverage enhancement technology used by the base station to transmit a first
signal, and/or determines a second signal that the base station supports transmitting, and/or
determines a function, supported by the base station, of a third signal.
[0120]      In this embodiment, the preset correspondence may be a preset function relationship, a
preset table relationship, or a preset specification relationship, and the preset correspondence may
be preconfigured by the base station by using signaling or may be preset by a system by using a
standard protocol.
[0121]      The preset correspondence       refers to a preset correspondence between a feature
parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal, a preset
correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported,
and a preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third
signal.
[0122]      Specifically, the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal may be: if the feature parameter is
less than or equal to a feature parameter threshold, the base station uses a first coverage
enhancement technology to transmit the first signal, and if the feature parameter is greater than the
feature parameter threshold, the base station uses a second coverage enhancement technology to
transmit the first signal, where both the first coverage enhancement technology and the second
coverage enhancement technology are technologies for improving signal transmission reliability,
and a main difference between the two lies in that they can implement different converge
enhancement intensities.
                                                   34

[0123]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which
transmission is supported may be: if the feature parameter is less than or equal to the feature
parameter threshold, the base station supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1, and if
the feature parameter is greater than the feature parameter threshold, the base station supports
transmitting a second signal in a signal set 2, where the second signal in the signal set 1 and the
second signal in the signal set 2 are different, and the difference herein mainly refers to that the
signal set 1 and the second set 2 include different types of second signals, but the signal set 1 and
the second set 2 may include a same quantity of or different quantities of second signals.
[0124]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the
third signal may be: if the feature parameter is less than or equal to the feature parameter threshold,
the base station supports using a function in a first function set of the third signal, and if the feature
parameter is greater than the feature parameter threshold, the base station supports using a function
in a second function set of the third signal, where the function in the first function set and the
function in the second function set are not completely the same.
[0125]       Besides, the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal may also be: if the feature parameter
belongs to a first feature parameter set, the base station uses a first coverage enhancement
technology to transmit the first signal, and if the feature parameter belongs to a second feature
parameter set, the base station uses a second coverage enhancement technology to transmit the first
signal, where both the first coverage enhancement technology and the second coverage
enhancement technology are technologies for improving signal transmission reliability, and a main
difference between the two lies in that they can implement different coverage enhancement
intensities.
[0126]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which
transmission is supported may also be: if the feature parameter belongs to the first feature parameter
set, the base station supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1, and if the feature
parameter belongs to the second feature parameter set, the base station supports transmitting a
second signal in a signal set 2, where the second signal in the signal set 1 and the second signal in
the signal set 2 are different, and the difference herein mainly refers to that the signal set 1 and the
second set 2 include different types of second signals, but the signal set 1 and the second set 2 may
include a same quantity of or different quantities of second signals.
[0127]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the
third signal may also be: if the feature parameter belongs to the first feature parameter set, the base
station supports a function in a first function set of the third signal, and if the feature parameter
                                                   35

belongs to the second feature parameter set, the base station supports using a function in a second
function set of the third signal, where the function in the first function set and the function in the
second function set are not completely the same.
[0128]      The foregoing feature parameter threshold, signal set 1, signal set 2, first function set,
second function set, first feature parameter set, and second feature parameter set may be
preconfigured by the base station by using signaling or may be preset by the system by using a
standard protocol.
[0129]      For example, the signal set 2 includes fewer signal types than the signal set 1. The signal
set 1 or the signal set 2 may be an empty set. The signal set 1 and the signal set 2 may include
completely different signals, and in this case, if the base station supports transmission of a signal in
the signal set 2, it indicates that the base station does not support transmission of a signal in the
signal set 1. The signal set 1 or the signal set 2 includes one or more types of the following signals:
a physical downlink control channel, an enhanced physical downlink control channel, a physical
random access channel, a physical control format indicator channel, a physical hybrid automatic
repeat request indicator channel, a unicast physical downlink shared channel, a broadcast or
multicast physical downlink shared channel, a physical uplink shared channel, a physical uplink
control channel, a synchronization channel, a physical broadcast channel, a common reference
signal, a demodulation reference signal, a dedicated reference signal, a random access response
message, a random access response acknowledgment message, a contention resolution message,
system information, and a paging message.
[0130]      In addition, the first function set includes a larger quantity of functions than the second
function set. Specifically, for example, the third signal is a PUCCH, and the first function set and
the second function set include one or more of the following functions: a function of reporting
channel quality information, a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back an
acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received; however, the second function
set includes a smaller quantity of functions than the first function set.
[0131]      After the second determining unit 201 determines the feature parameter of the UE, the
second processing unit 202 may determine, according to the preset correspondence between a
feature parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal, a
coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal and that corresponds to the
feature parameter of the UE; and/or
            the second processing unit 202 determines, according to the preset correspondence
between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported, a second signal
to which the feature parameter of the UE corresponds, wherein transmission of the second signal is
                                                    36

supported by the feature parameter;       and/or
             the second processing unit 202 determines, according to the preset correspondence
between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third signal, a supported function that
is corresponding to the feature parameter of the UE and is of the third signal.
[0132]       The first signal, the second signal, and the third signal herein may be the same or may be
different. That is, the first signal and the second signal may be the same or may be different; the
first signal and the third signal may be the same or may be different; and the second signal and the
third signal may be the same or may be different.
[0133]       The first signal, the second signal, or the third signal includes at least one of the
following:
[0134]       a physical downlink control channel, an enhanced physical downlink control channel, a
physical random access channel, a physical control format indicator channel, a physical hybrid
automatic repeat request indicator channel, a unicast physical downlink shared channel, a broadcast
or multicast physical downlink shared channel, a physical uplink shared channel, a physical uplink
control channel, a synchronization channel, a physical broadcast channel, a common reference
signal, a demodulation reference signal, a dedicated reference signal, a random access response
message, a random access response acknowledgment message, a contention resolution message,
system information, and a paging message.
[0135]       The "transmission" in this embodiment refers to sending or receiving. The "transmit" in
this embodiment refers to send or receive.
[0136]       By using an example in which the feature parameter of the UE is a coverage
enhancement value, the following describes determining, by the base station according to the
feature parameter of the UE and the preset correspondence, the coverage enhancement technology
used by the base station to transmit the first signal, and/or determining the second signal that the
base station supports transmitting, and/or determining the function, supported by the base station, of
the third signal.
[0137]       For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to
transmit the first signal is: when a coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and
less than or equal to X dB), a first coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit the first
signal; when the coverage enhancement value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X
dB and less than or equal to Y dB), a second coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit
the first signal. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature threshold.
[0138]       If the second determining unit 201 determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE
                                                     37

is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the second processing unit 202
determines, according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal, that the first coverage enhancement
technology is used to transmit the first signal during communication with the UE. If the second
determining unit 201 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or is
greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the second processing
unit 202 determines, according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal, that the second coverage
enhancement technology is used to transmit the first signal during communication with the UE.
[0139]      In this embodiment, the first coverage enhancement technology and the second coverage
enhancement technology may be one of or a combination of multiple of the following technologies:
retransmission, spread spectrum transmission, low bit-rate transmission, transmission time interval
bundling (TTI bundling) transmission, power boosting (power boosting), power spectrum density
boosting (PSD boosting), keep trying (keep trying), relaxing requirement, frequency hopping, and
maximum likelihood detection.
[0140]      More specifically, for example, the first signal is a physical uplink control channel
PUCCH, and the base station or the system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement
value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB, the relaxing requirement (and/or
frequency hopping) is used to perform PUCCH coverage enhancement; when the coverage
enhancement value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), the
relaxing requirement (and/or frequency hopping) and repeated transmission are used to perform
PUCCH coverage enhancement. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold.
For example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If the second determining unit 201
determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE 1 is 3 dB, that is, the coverage enhancement
value is less than 5 dB, the second processing unit 202 determines that the relaxing requirement
(and/or frequency hopping) is used to perform PUCCH coverage enhancement for the PUCCH, and
the second processing unit 202 correspondingly receives the PUCCH in this manner. If the second
determining unit 201 determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE 2 is 8 dB, that is, the
coverage enhancement value is greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB (or is greater than 5 dB), the
second processing unit 202 determines that the relaxing requirement (and/or frequency hopping)
and repeated transmission are used to perform PUCCH coverage enhancement for the PUCCH, and
the second processing unit 202 correspondingly receives the PUCCH in this manner.
[0141]      Specifically, for another example, the first signal is a physical broadcast channel PBCH,
and the base station or the system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement value is not
                                                  38

greater than C dB, keep trying is used to perform PBCH coverage enhancement; when the coverage
enhancement value is not greater than D dB, keep trying and retransmission are used to perform
PBCH coverage enhancement. Herein, C and/or D are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold.
For example, it is specified in advance that C=10, and D=15. If the second determining unit 201
determines that a current coverage enhancement value of UE (one UE or multiple UEs) is not
greater than 10 dB, the second processing unit 202 determines that keep trying is used to perform
PBCH coverage enhancement for the PBCH. If the second determining unit 201 determines that a
current coverage enhancement value of UE (one UE or multiple UEs) is not greater than 15 dB, the
second determining unit 201 determines that keep trying and retransmission are used to perform
PBCH coverage enhancement for the PBCH.
[0142]      For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported is:
when a coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB),
the base station supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1; when the coverage
enhancement value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal
to Y dB), the base station supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 2. Herein, X and/or Y
are/is a predefined feature threshold.
[0143]      If the second determining unit 201 determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE
is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the second processing unit 202
determines, according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of
which transmission is supported, that transmission of the second signal in the signal set 1 is
supported during communication with the UE. If the second determining unit 201 determines that
the coverage enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB
and less than or equal to Y dB), the second processing unit 202 determines, according to the
correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported,
that transmission of the second signal in the signal set 2 is supported during communication with
the UE.
[0144]      More specifically, for example, the second signal in the transmission signal set 1 is a
PBCH and a physical hybrid automatic repeat request indicator channel PHICH, and the second
signal in the signal set 2 is a PBCH. The base station or the system specifies in advance: when a
coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB, transmission of the
second signal in the signal set 1 is supported; when the coverage enhancement value is greater than
X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), transmission of the second signal in
the signal set 2 is supported. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold. For
                                                  39

example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If a coverage enhancement value of UE 1 is
3 dB, the second determining unit 201 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1
is less than 5 dB, and therefore, the second processing unit 202 determines that the PBCH and the
PHICH can be supported during communication with the UE 1. If the second determining unit 201
determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE 2 is 8 dB, that is, the coverage enhancement
value of the UE 2 is greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB, the second processing unit 202
determines that the PBCH is supported during communication with the UE 2, that is, it is
determined the PHICH is not supported during communication with the UE 2.
[0145]      Specifically, for another example, the second signal in the transmission signal set 1 is a
PUCCH (or a PHICH), and the second signal in the transmission signal set 2 is a null signal, that is,
the transmission signal set 2 does not include any signal. The base station or the system specifies in
advance: when a coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB,
transmission of the second signal in the signal set 1 is supported; when the coverage enhancement
value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), transmission of
the second signal in the signal set 2 is supported. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature
parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If the second
determining unit 201 determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE 1 is 3 dB, that is, it is
determined that the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is less than 5 dB, the second
processing unit 202 determines that the PUCCH (or the PHICH) can be supported during
communication with the UE 1. If the second determining unit 201 determines that the coverage
enhancement value of the UE 1 is 8 dB, that is, the coverage enhancement value is greater than 5
dB and less than 10 dB (or is greater than 5 dB), the second processing unit 202 determines that
transmission of the signal in the signal set 1 is not supported during communication with the UE 1,
that is, the PUCCH (or the PHICH) is not supported during communication between the base
station and the UE 1.
[0146]      For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third signal is: when a
coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the
base station supports a function in a first function set of the third signal; when the coverage
enhancement value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal
to Y dB), the base station supports a function in a second function of the third signal. Herein, X
and/or Y are/is a predefined feature threshold.
[0147]      If the second determining unit 201 determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE
is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the second processing unit 202
                                                   40

determines, according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function
of the third signal, that the function in the first function set of the third signal is supported. If the
second determining unit 201 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or
is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the second processing
unit 202 determines, according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported
function of the third signal, that the function in the second function set of the third signal is
supported.
[0148]      More specifically, for example, the third signal is a PUCCH. The base station or the
system specifies in advance that functions in a first function set of the PUCCH include a function of
reporting channel quality information, a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back
an acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received; functions in a second
function set of the PUCCH include a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back an
acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received. Besides, the base station or the
system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than
or equal to X dB, the functions in the first function set of the third signal are supported; when the
coverage enhancement value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than
X dB), the functions in the second function set of the third signal are supported. Herein, X and/or Y
are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in advance that X=5,
and Y=10. If the second determining unit 201 determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE
1 is 3 dB, that is, it is determined that the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is less than 5 dB,
the second processing unit 202 determines that the following functions of the PUCCH are supported
during communication with the UE 1: the function of reporting channel quality information , the
scheduling request function, and the function of feeding back an acknowledgement indicating
whether a signal is correctly received.. If the second determining unit 201 determines that the
coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is 8 dB, that is, it is determined that the coverage
enhancement value of the UE 1 is greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB (or is greater than 5 dB),
the second processing unit 202 determines that the scheduling request function and the function of
feeding back an acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received of the PUCCH
are supported during communication with the UE 1.
[0149]      It should be noted that the foregoing description of method implementation of this
embodiment is provided by using an example in which the feature parameter is a coverage
enhancement value. When the feature parameter is a level, a level index, a quantity of repetition
times, an index of a quantity of repetition times, a resource, a resource index, an enhancement level,
an enhancement level index, or other information (which reflects communication quality, channel

quality, or a service feature), implementation of this embodiment may be performed similarly
according to the foregoing description, and details are not described herein again.
[0150]      In this embodiment, according to a current feature parameter of UE and a preset
correspondence, a second processing unit may adaptively determine a coverage enhancement
technology used to transmit a first signal between the UE and the base station, and/or determine a
second signal of which transmission is supported between the UE and the base station, and/or
determine a supported function of a third signal, thereby adapting to different feature parameters of
the UE, so as to optimize resource utilization of a system, decrease processing complexity, and
reduce power consumption.
[0151]      The following describes another embodiment of UE according to the present invention.
Referring to FIG. 3, UE 300 of this embodiment includes:
            a first memory 301, configured to store a preset correspondence; and
            a first processor 302, configured to determine a feature parameter of the UE, where the
feature parameter of the UE refers to: a value or information used to measure communication
quality of the UE, and/or a value or information used to measure channel quality of the UE, and/or
information used to reflect a service feature of the UE; and according to the feature parameter of the
UE and the preset correspondence, determine a coverage enhancement technology used by the UE
to transmit a first signal, and/or determine a second signal that the UE supports transmitting, and/or
determine a function, supported by the UE, of a third signal.
[0152]      For ease of comprehension, the following describes, by using an actual application
scenario, an interaction manner between the units of the UE 300 in this embodiment:
[0153]      A preset correspondence is stored in the first memory 301. In this embodiment, the
preset correspondence may be a preset function relationship, a preset table relationship, or a preset
specification relationship, and the preset correspondence may be preconfigured by a base station by
using signaling or may be preset by a system by using a standard protocol.
[0154]      The preset correspondence       refers to a preset correspondence between a feature
parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal, a preset
correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported,
and a preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third
signal.
[0155]      Specifically, the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal may be: if the feature parameter is
less than or equal to a feature parameter threshold, the UE uses a first coverage enhancement
technology to transmit the first signal, and if the feature parameter is greater than the feature
                                                   42

parameter threshold, the UE uses a second coverage enhancement technology to transmit the first
signal, where both the first coverage enhancement technology and the second coverage
enhancement technology are technologies for improving signal transmission reliability, and a main
difference between the two lies in that they can implement different coverage enhancement
intensities.
[0156]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which
transmission is supported may be: if the feature parameter is less than or equal to the feature
parameter threshold, the UE supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1, and if the feature
parameter is greater than the feature parameter threshold, the UE supports transmitting a second
signal in a signal set 2, where the second signal in the signal set 1 and the second signal in the
signal set 2 are different, and the difference herein mainly refers to that the signal set 1 and the
second set 2 include different types of second signals, but the signal set 1 and the second set 2 may
include a same quantity of or different quantities of second signals.
[0157]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the
third signal may be: if the feature parameter is less than or equal to the feature parameter threshold,
the UE supports using a function in a first function set of the third signal, and if the feature
parameter is greater than the feature parameter threshold, the UE supports using a function in a
second function set of the third signal, where the function in the first function set and the function in
the second function set are not completely the same.
[0158]       Besides, the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal may also be: if the feature parameter
belongs to a first feature parameter set, the UE uses a first coverage enhancement technology to
transmit the first signal, and if the feature parameter belongs to a second feature parameter set, the
UE uses a second coverage enhancement technology to transmit the first signal, where both the first
coverage     enhancement technology and the second coverage enhancement technology                    are
technologies for improving signal transmission reliability, and a main difference between the two
lies that they can implement different coverage enhancement intensities.
[0159]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which
transmission is supported may also be: if the feature parameter belongs to the first feature parameter
set, the UE supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1, and if the feature parameter
belongs to the second feature parameter set, the UE supports transmitting a second signal in a signal
set 2, where the second signal in the signal set 1 and the second signal in the signal set 2 are
different, and the difference herein mainly refers to that the signal set 1 and the second set 2 include
different types of second signals, but the signal set 1 and the second set 2 may include a same
                                                   43

quantity of or different quantities of second signals.
[0160]      The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the
third signal may also be: if the feature parameter belongs to the first feature parameter set, the UE
supports a function in a first function set of the third signal, and if the feature parameter belongs to
the second feature parameter set, the UE supports using a function in a second function set of the
third signal, where the function in the first function set and the function in the second function set
are not completely the same.
[0161]      The foregoing feature parameter threshold, signal set 1, signal set 2, first function set,
second function set, first feature parameter set, and second feature parameter set may be
preconfigured by the base station by using signaling or may be preset by the system by using a
standard protocol.
[0162]      For example, the signal set 2 includes fewer signal types than the signal set 1. The signal
set 1 or the signal set 2 may be an empty set. The signal set 1 and the signal set 2 may include
completely different signals, and in this case, if the UE supports transmission of a signal in the
signal set 2, it indicates that the UE does not support transmission of a signal in the signal set 1. The
signal set 1 or the signal set 2 includes one or more types of the following signals: a physical
downlink control channel, an enhanced physical downlink control channel, a physical random
access channel, a physical control format indicator channel, a physical hybrid automatic repeat
request indicator channel, a unicast physical downlink shared channel, a broadcast or multicast
physical downlink shared channel, a physical uplink shared channel, a physical uplink control
channel, a synchronization channel, a physical broadcast channel, a common reference signal, a
demodulation reference signal, a dedicated reference signal, a random access response message, a
random access response acknowledgment message, a contention resolution message, system
information, and a paging message.
[0163]      In addition, the first function set includes a larger quantity of functions than the second
function set. Specifically, for example, the third signal is a PUCCH, and the first function set and
the second function set include one or more of the following functions: a function of reporting
channel quality information, a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back an
acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received; however, the second function
set includes a smaller quantity of functions than the first function set.
[0164]      The first processor 302 determines a feature parameter of the UE, where the feature
parameter of the UE refers to a value or information used to measure communication quality of the
UE, and/or a value or information used to measure channel quality of the UE, and/or information
used to reflect a service feature of the UE.
                                                    44

[0165]       Specifically, the feature parameter of the UE may include at least one of the following: a
resource, a resource index, a level, a level index, an enhancement level, an enhancement level index,
a repetition level, a repetition level index, a quantity of repetition times, an index of a quantity of
repetition times, a coverage enhancement value, an index of a coverage enhancement range, a path
loss value, an index of a path loss range, a reference signal received power value, an index of a
reference signal received power range, a reference signal received quality value, an index of a
reference signal received quality range, a channel quality information value, an index of a channel
quality information range, a service type, an index of a service type, a power saving requirement, an
index of a power saving requirement, a delay requirement, an index of a delay requirement, a
quantity of times of detecting a pre-specified channel, an index of a quantity of times of detecting a
pre-specified channel, a mobility requirement, and an index of a mobility requirement.
[0166]       The first processor 302 may determine the feature parameter of the UE according to
received signaling that indicates the feature parameter of the UE, where the signaling may be sent
by another UE to the UE of this embodiment, or may be sent by the base station or another network
entity to the UE. Alternatively, the first processor 302 determines the feature parameter of the UE
according to whether a downlink signal can be correctly received. For example, the UE sends an
uplink signal to the base station, and if the UE can correctly receive a corresponding downlink
signal that is fed back by the base station, the first processor 302 can determine a current feature
parameter of the UE (for example, a feature parameter that represents current communication
quality). Alternatively, the first processor 302 determines the feature parameter of the UE by
measuring a received downlink signal. Alternatively, the first processor 302 determines the feature
parameter of the UE autonomously.
[0167]       After determining the feature parameter of the UE, according to the feature parameter of
the UE and the preset correspondence, the first processor 302 determines a coverage enhancement
technology used by the UE to transmit a first signal, and/or determines a second signal that the UE
supports transmitting, and/or determines a function, supported by the UE, of a third signal.
[0168]       After the first processor 302 determines the feature parameter of the UE, the first
processor 302 may determine, according to the preset correspondence between a feature parameter
and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal, a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal and that corresponds to the feature
parameter of the UE; and/or
             the first processor 302 determines, according to the preset correspondence between a
feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported, a second signal            to
which the feature parameter of the UE corresponds, wherein transmission of the second signal is
                                                    45

supported by the feature parameter; and/or
             the first processor 302 determines, according to the preset correspondence between a
feature parameter and a supported function of the third signal, a supported function that is
corresponding to the feature parameter of the UE and is of the third signal.
[0169]       The first signal, the second signal, and the third signal herein may be the same or may be
different. That is, the first signal and the second signal may be the same or may be different; the
first signal and the third signal may be the same or may be different; and the second signal and the
third signal may be the same or may be different.
[0170]       The first signal, the second signal, or the third signal includes at least one of the
following:
             a physical downlink control channel, an enhanced physical downlink control channel, a
physical random access channel, a physical control format indicator channel, a physical hybrid
automatic repeat request indicator channel, a unicast physical downlink shared channel, a broadcast
or multicast physical downlink shared channel, a physical uplink shared channel, a physical uplink
control channel, a synchronization channel, a physical broadcast channel, a common reference
signal, a demodulation reference signal, a dedicated reference signal, a random access response
message, a random access response acknowledgment message, a contention resolution message,
system information, and a paging message.
[0171]       The "transmission" in this embodiment refers to sending or receiving. The "transmit" in
this embodiment refers to send or receive.
[0172]       By using an example in which the feature parameter of the UE is a coverage
enhancement value, the following describes determining, by the UE according to the feature
parameter of the UE and the preset correspondence, the coverage enhancement technology used by
the UE to transmit the first signal, and/or determining the second signal that the UE supports
transmitting, and/or determining the function, supported by the UE, of the third signal.
[0173]       For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to
transmit the first signal is: when a coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and
less than or equal to X dB), a first coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit the first
signal; when the coverage enhancement value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X
dB and less than or equal to Y dB), a second coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit
the first signal. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature threshold.
[0174]       If the first processor 302 determines that a coverage enhancement value of the UE is X
dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the first processor 302 determines,
                                                     46

according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage enhancement
technology that is used to transmit the first signal, that the first coverage enhancement technology is
used to transmit the first signal. If the first processor 302 determines that the coverage enhancement
value of the UE is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y
dB), the first processor 302 determines, according to the correspondence between a feature
parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal, that the
second coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit the first signal.
[0175]      In this embodiment, the first coverage enhancement technology and the second coverage
enhancement technology may be one of or a combination of multiple of the following technologies:
retransmission, spread spectrum transmission, low bit-rate transmission, transmission time interval
bundling (TTI bundling) transmission, power boosting (power boosting), power spectrum density
boosting (PSD boosting), keep trying (keep trying), relaxing requirement, frequency hopping, and
maximum likelihood detection.
[0176]      More specifically, for example, the first signal is a physical uplink control channel
PUCCH, and the base station or the system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement
value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB, the relaxing requirement (and/or
frequency hopping) is used to perform PUCCH coverage enhancement; when the coverage
enhancement value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), the
relaxing requirement (and/or frequency hopping) and repeated transmission are used to perform
PUCCH coverage enhancement. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold.
For example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If the coverage enhancement value
determined by the first processor 302 is 3 dB, that is, the coverage enhancement value is less than 5
dB, the first processor 302 determines that the relaxing requirement (and/or frequency hopping) is
used to perform PUCCH coverage enhancement for the PUCCH. If the coverage enhancement
value determined by the first processor 302 is 8 dB, that is, the coverage enhancement value is
greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB (or is greater than 5 dB), the first processor 302 determines
that the relaxing requirement (and/or frequency hopping) and repeated transmission are used to
perform PUCCH coverage enhancement for the PUCCH.
[0177]      Specifically, for another example, the first signal is a physical broadcast channel PBCH,
and the base station or the system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement value is C
dB, keep trying is used to perform PBCH coverage enhancement; when the coverage enhancement
value is D dB, keep trying and retransmission are used to perform PBCH coverage enhancement.
Herein, C and/or D are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in
advance that C=10, and D=15. If the first processor 302 determines that the coverage enhancement
                                                      47

value is 10 dB, the first processor 302 determines that keep trying is used to perform PBCH
coverage enhancement for the PBCH, and the first processor 302 keeps trying PBCH detection to
detect the PBCH. If the first processor 302 determines that the coverage enhancement value is 15
dB, the first processor 302 determines that keep trying and retransmission are used to perform
PBCH coverage enhancement for the PBCH, and the first processor 302 keeps trying repetition of
PBCH detection to detect the PBCH.
[0178]      For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported is:
when a coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB),
the UE supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1; when the coverage enhancement
value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the
UE supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 2. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined
feature threshold.
[0179]      If the first processor 302 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE is X
dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the first processor 302 determines,
according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which
transmission is supported, that transmission of the second signal in the signal set 1 is supported. If
the first processor 302 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or is
greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the first processor 302
determines, according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of
which transmission is supported, that transmission of the second signal in the signal set 2 is
supported.
[0180]      More specifically, for example, the second signal in the transmission signal set 1 is a
PBCH and a physical hybrid automatic repeat request indicator channel PHICH, and the second
signal in the signal set 2 is a PBCH. The base station or the system specifies in advance: when a
coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB, transmission of the
second signal in the signal set 1 is supported; when the coverage enhancement value is greater than
X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), transmission of the second signal in
the signal set 2 is supported. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold. For
example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If the coverage enhancement value
determined by the first processor 302 is 3 dB, that is, the coverage enhancement value is less than 5
dB, the first processor 302 determines that the PBCH and PHICH can be supported. If the coverage
enhancement value determined by the first processor 302 is 8 dB, that is, the coverage enhancement
value is greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB, the first processor 302 determines that the PBCH is
                                                   48

supported, that is, the first processor 302 determines that the PHICH is not supported.
[0181]       Specifically, for another example, the second signal in the transmission signal set 1 is a
PUCCH (or a PHICH), and the second signal in the transmission signal set 2 is a null signal, that is,
the transmission signal set 2 does not include any signal. The base station or the system specifies in
advance: when a coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB,
transmission of the second signal in the signal set 1 is supported; when the coverage enhancement
value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), transmission of
the second signal in the signal set 2 is supported. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature
parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If a coverage
enhancement value of UE 1 is 3 dB, the UE 1 determines that the coverage enhancement value of
the UE 1 is less than 5 dB, and therefore, the UE 1 determines that the PUCCH (or the PHICH) can
be supported. If the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is 8 dB, the UE 1 determines that the
coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB (or is greater than
5 dB), and the UE 1 determines that transmission of the signal in the signal set 1 is not supported,
that is, UE 2 determines that the PUCCH (or the PHICH) is not supported.
[0182]      For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third signal is: when a
coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the
UE supports a function in a first function set of the third signal; when the coverage enhancement
value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the
UE supports a function in a second function of the third signal. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a
predefined feature threshold.
[0183]      If the first processor 302 determines that a coverage enhancement value of the UE is X
dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the first processor 302 determines,
according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third
signal, that the function in the first function set of the third signal is supported. If the first processor
302 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or
is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the first processor 302 determines, according
to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third signal, that
the function in the second function set of the third signal is supported.
[0184]      More specifically, for example, the third signal is a PUCCH. The base station or the
system specifies in advance that functions in a first function set of the PUCCH include a function of
reporting channel quality information, a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back
an acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received; functions in a second
                                                     49

function set of the PUCCH include a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back an
acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received. Besides, the base station or the
system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than
or equal to X dB, the functions in the first function set of the third signal are supported; when the
coverage enhancement value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than
X dB), the functions in the second function set of the third signal are supported. Herein, X and/or Y
are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in advance that X=5,
and Y=10. If the coverage enhancement value determined by the first processor 302 is 3 dB, that is,
the coverage enhancement value is less than 5 dB, the first processor 302 determines that the
following functions of the PUCCH are supported: the function of reporting channel quality
information, the scheduling request function, and the function of feeding back an acknowledgement
indicating whether a signal is correctly received.. If the coverage enhancement value determined by
the first processor 302 is 8 dB, that is, the coverage enhancement value is greater than 5 dB and less
than 10 dB (or is greater than 5 dB), the first processor 302 determines that the scheduling request
function and the function of feeding back an acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is
correctly received of the PUCCH are supported.
[0185]       It should be noted that the foregoing description of method implementation of this
embodiment is provided by using an example in which the feature parameter is a coverage
enhancement value. When the feature parameter is a level, a level index, a quantity of repetition
times, an index of a quantity of repetition times, a resource, a resource index, an enhancement level,
an enhancement level index, or other information (which reflects communication quality, channel
quality, or a service feature), implementation of this embodiment may be performed similarly
according to the foregoing description, and details are not described herein again.
[0186]       In this embodiment, according to a current feature parameter of UE and a preset
correspondence, a first processor may adaptively determine a coverage enhancement technology
used to transmit a first signal between the UE and a base station, and/or determine a second signal
of which transmission is supported between the UE and a base station, and/or determine a supported
function of a third signal, thereby adapting to different feature parameters, so as to optimize
resource utilization of a system, decrease processing complexity, and reduce power consumption.
[0187]       The following describes another embodiment of a base station according to the present
invention. Referring to FIG. 4, a base station 400 of this embodiment includes:
             a second memory 401, configured to store a preset correspondence; and
             a second processor 402, configured to determine a feature parameter of UE, where the
feature parameter of the UE refers to: a value or information used to measure communication
                                                    50

quality of the UE, and/or a value or information used to measure channel quality of the UE, and/or
information used to reflect a service feature of the UE; and according to the feature parameter of the
UE and the preset correspondence, determine a coverage enhancement technology used by the base
station to transmit a first signal, and/or determine a second signal that the base station supports
transmitting, and/or determine a function, supported by the base station, of a third signal.
[0188]      For ease of comprehension, the following describes, by using an actual application
scenario, an interaction manner between the units of the base station 400 in this embodiment:
[0189]      The UE in this embodiment refers to UE that communicates with the base station 400.
[0190]      A preset correspondence is stored in the second memory 401. In this embodiment, the
preset correspondence may be a preset function relationship, a preset table relationship, or a preset
specification relationship, and the preset correspondence may be preconfigured by the base station
by using signaling or may be preset by a system by using a standard protocol.
[0191]      The preset correspondence       refers to a preset correspondence between a feature
parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal, a preset
correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported,
and a preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third
signal.
[0192]      Specifically, the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal may be: if the feature parameter is
less than or equal to a feature parameter threshold, the base station uses a first coverage
enhancement technology to transmit the first signal, and if the feature parameter is greater than the
feature parameter threshold, the base station uses a second coverage enhancement technology to
transmit the first signal, where both the first coverage enhancement technology and the second
coverage enhancement technology are technologies for improving signal transmission reliability,
and a main difference between the two lies in that they can implement different converge
enhancement intensities.
[0193]      The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which
transmission is supported may be: if the feature parameter is less than or equal to the feature
parameter threshold, the base station supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1, and if
the feature parameter is greater than the feature parameter threshold, the base station supports
transmitting a second signal in a signal set 2, where the second signal in the signal set 1 and the
second signal in the signal set 2 are different, and the difference herein mainly refers to that the
signal set 1 and the second set 2 include different types of second signals, but the signal set 1 and
the second set 2 may include a same quantity of or different quantities of second signals.
                                                   51

[0194]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the
third signal may be: if the feature parameter is less than or equal to the feature parameter threshold,
the base station supports using a function in a first function set of the third signal, and if the feature
parameter is greater than the feature parameter threshold, the base station supports using a function
in a second function set of the third signal, where the function in the first function set and the
function in the second function set are not completely the same.
[0195]       Besides, the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal may also be: if the feature parameter
belongs to a first feature parameter set, the base station uses a first coverage enhancement
technology to transmit the first signal, and if the feature parameter belongs to a second feature
parameter set, the base station uses a second coverage enhancement technology to transmit the first
signal, where both the first coverage enhancement technology and the second coverage
enhancement technology are technologies for improving signal transmission reliability, and a main
difference between the two lies in that they can implement different coverage enhancement
intensities.
[0196]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which
transmission is supported may also be: if the feature parameter belongs to the first feature parameter
set, the base station supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1, and if the feature
parameter belongs to the second feature parameter set, the base station supports transmitting a
second signal in a signal set 2, where the second signal in the signal set 1 and the second signal in
the signal set 2 are different, and the difference herein mainly refers to that the signal set 1 and the
second set 2 include different types of second signals, but the signal set 1 and the second set 2 may
include a same quantity of or different quantities of second signals.
[0197]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the
third signal may also be: if the feature parameter belongs to the first feature parameter set, the base
station supports a function in a first function set of the third signal, and if the feature parameter
belongs to the second feature parameter set, the base station supports using a function in a second
function set of the third signal, where the function in the first function set and the function in the
second function set are not completely the same.
[0198]       The foregoing feature parameter threshold, signal set 1, signal set 2, first function set,
second function set, first feature parameter set, and second feature parameter set may be
preconfigured by the base station by using signaling or may be preset by the system by using a
standard protocol.
[0199]       For example, the signal set 2 includes fewer signal types than the signal set 1. The signal
                                                   52

set 1 or the signal set 2 may be an empty set. The signal set 1 and the signal set 2 may include
completely different signals, and in this case, if the base station supports transmission of a signal in
the signal set 2, it indicates that the base station does not support transmission of a signal in the
signal set 1. The signal set 1 or the signal set 2 includes one or more types of the following signals:
a physical downlink control channel, an enhanced physical downlink control channel, a physical
random access channel, a physical control format indicator channel, a physical hybrid automatic
repeat request indicator channel, a unicast physical downlink shared channel, a broadcast or
multicast physical downlink shared channel, a physical uplink shared channel, a physical uplink
control channel, a synchronization channel, a physical broadcast channel, a common reference
signal, a demodulation reference signal, a dedicated reference signal, a random access response
message, a random access response acknowledgment message, a contention resolution message,
system information, and a paging message.
[0200]       In addition, the first function set includes a larger quantity of functions than the second
function set. Specifically, for example, the third signal is a PUCCH, and the first function set and
the second function set include one or more of the following functions: a function of reporting
channel quality information, a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back an
acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received; however, the second function
set includes a smaller quantity of functions than the first function set.
[0201]       The second processor 402 determines a feature parameter of the UE, where the feature
parameter of the UE refers to a value or information used to measure communication quality of the
UE, and/or a value or information used to measure channel quality of the UE, and/or information
used to reflect a service feature of the UE.
[0202]       Specifically, the feature parameter of the UE may include at least one of the following: a
resource, a resource index, a level, a level index, an enhancement level, an enhancement level index,
a repetition level, a repetition level index, a quantity of repetition times, an index of a quantity of
repetition times, a coverage enhancement value, an index of a coverage enhancement range, a path
loss value, an index of a path loss range, a reference signal received power value, an index of a
reference signal received power range, a reference signal received quality value, an index of a
reference signal received quality range, a channel quality information value, an index of a channel
quality information range, a service type, an index of a service type, a power saving requirement, an
index of a power saving requirement, a delay requirement, an index of a delay requirement, a
quantity of times of detecting a pre-specified channel, an index of a quantity of times of detecting a
pre-specified channel, a mobility requirement, and an index of a mobility requirement.
[0203]       The second processor 402 may determine the feature parameter of the UE according to
                                                     53

received signaling that indicates the feature parameter of the UE, where the signaling may be sent
by the UE or another network entity to the base station. Alternatively, the second processor 402
determines the feature parameter of the UE according to whether an uplink signal can be correctly
received. For example, the base station sends a downlink signal to the UE, and if the base station
can correctly receive a corresponding uplink signal that is fed back by the UE, the second processor
402 can determine a current feature parameter of the UE (for example, a feature parameter that
represents current communication quality). Alternatively, the second processor 402 determines the
feature parameter of the UE by measuring a received uplink signal. Alternatively, the second
processor 402 determines the feature parameter of the UE autonomously.
[0204]       After determining the feature parameter of the UE, according to the feature parameter of
the UE and the preset correspondence, the second processor 402 determines a coverage
enhancement technology used by the base station to transmit a first signal, and/or determines a
second signal that the base station supports transmitting, and/or determines a function, supported by
the base station, of a third signal.
[0205]       After the second processor 402 determines the feature parameter of the UE, the second
processor 402 may determine, according to the preset correspondence between a feature parameter
and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal, a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal and that corresponds to the feature
parameter of the UE; and/or
             the second processor 402 determines, according to the preset correspondence between a
feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported, a second signal            to
which the feature parameter of the UE corresponds, wherein transmission of the second signal is
supported by the feature parameter; and/or
             the second processor 402 determines, according to the preset correspondence between a
feature parameter and a supported function of the third signal, a supported function that is
corresponding to the feature parameter of the UE and is of the third signal.
[0206]       The first signal, the second signal, and the third signal herein may be the same or may be
different. That is, the first signal and the second signal may be the same or may be different; the
first signal and the third signal may be the same or may be different; and the second signal and the
third signal may be the same or may be different.
[0207]       The first signal, the second signal, or the third signal includes at least one of the
following:
             a physical downlink control channel, an enhanced physical downlink control channel, a
physical random access channel, a physical control format indicator channel, a physical hybrid
                                                     54

automatic repeat request indicator channel, a unicast physical downlink shared channel, a broadcast
or multicast physical downlink shared channel, a physical uplink shared channel, a physical uplink
control channel, a synchronization channel, a physical broadcast channel, a common reference
signal, a demodulation reference signal, a dedicated reference signal, a random access response
message, a random access response acknowledgment message, a contention resolution message,
system information, and a paging message.
[0208]       The "transmission" in this embodiment refers to sending or receiving. The "transmit" in
this embodiment refers to send or receive.
[0209]       By using an example in which the feature parameter of the UE is a coverage
enhancement value, the following describes determining, by the base station according to the
feature parameter of the UE and the preset correspondence, the coverage enhancement technology
used by the base station to transmit the first signal, and/or determining the second signal that the
base station supports transmitting, and/or determining the function, supported by the base station, of
the third signal.
[0210]       For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to
transmit the first signal is: when a coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and
less than or equal to X dB), a first coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit the first
signal; when the coverage enhancement value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X
dB and less than or equal to Y dB), a second coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit
the first signal. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature threshold.
[0211]       If the second processor 402 determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE is X
dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the second processor 402 determines,
according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage enhancement
technology that is used to transmit the first signal, that the first coverage enhancement technology is
used to transmit the first signal during communication with the UE. If the second processor 402
determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is
greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the second processor 402 determines, according
to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is
used to transmit the first signal, that the second coverage enhancement technology is used to
transmit the first signal during communication with the UE.
[0212]       In this embodiment, the first coverage enhancement technology and the second coverage
enhancement technology may be one of or a combination of multiple of the following technologies:
retransmission, spread spectrum transmission, low bit-rate transmission, transmission time interval
                                                    55

bundling (TTI bundling) transmission, power boosting (power boosting), power spectrum density
boosting (PSD boosting), keep trying (keep trying), relaxing requirement, frequency hopping, and
maximum likelihood detection.
[0213]      More specifically, for example, the first signal is a physical uplink control channel
PUCCH, and the base station or the system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement
value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB, the relaxing requirement (and/or
frequency hopping) is used to perform PUCCH coverage enhancement; when the coverage
enhancement value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), the
relaxing requirement (and/or frequency hopping) and repeated transmission are used to perform
PUCCH coverage enhancement. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold.
For example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If the second processor 402 determines
that a coverage enhancement value of UE 1 is 3 dB, that is, the coverage enhancement value is less
than 5 dB, the second processor 402 determines that the relaxing requirement (and/or frequency
hopping) is used to perform PUCCH coverage enhancement for the PUCCH, and the second
processor 402 correspondingly receives the PUCCH in this manner. If the second processor 402
determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE 2 is 8 dB, that is, the coverage enhancement
value is greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB (or is greater than 5 dB), the second processor 402
determines that the relaxing requirement (and/or frequency hopping) and repeated transmission are
used to perform PUCCH coverage enhancement for the PUCCH, and the second processor 402
correspondingly receives the PUCCH in this manner.
[0214]      Specifically, for another example, the first signal is a physical broadcast channel PBCH,
and the base station or the system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement value is not
greater than C dB, keep trying is used to perform PBCH coverage enhancement; when the coverage
enhancement value is not greater than D dB, keep trying and retransmission are used to perform
PBCH coverage enhancement. Herein, C and/or D are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold.
For example, it is specified in advance that C=10, and D=15. If the second processor 402
determines that a current coverage enhancement value of UE (one UE or multiple UEs) is not
greater than 10 dB, the second processor 402 determines that keep trying is used to perform PBCH
coverage enhancement for the PBCH. If the second processor 402 determines that a current
coverage enhancement value of UE (one UE or multiple UEs) is not greater than 15 dB, the second
processor 402 determines that keep trying and retransmission are used to perform PBCH coverage
enhancement for the PBCH.
[0215]      For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported is:
                                                  56

when a coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB),
the base station supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1; when the coverage
enhancement value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal
to Y dB), the base station supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 2. Herein, X and/or Y
are/is a predefined feature threshold.
[0216]      If the second processor 402 determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE is X
dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the second processor 402 determines,
according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which
transmission is supported, that transmission of the second signal in the signal set 1 is supported
during communication with the UE. If the second processor 402 determines that the coverage
enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than
or equal to Y dB), the second processor 402 determines, according to the correspondence between a
feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported, that transmission of the
second signal in the signal set 2 is supported during communication with the UE.
[0217]      More specifically, for example, the second signal in the transmission signal set 1 is a
PBCH and a physical hybrid automatic repeat request indicator channel PHICH, and the second
signal in the signal set 2 is a PBCH. The base station or the system specifies in advance: when a
coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB, transmission of the
second signal in the signal set 1 is supported; when the coverage enhancement value is greater than
X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), transmission of the second signal in
the signal set 2 is supported. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold. For
example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If a coverage enhancement value of UE 1 is
3 dB, the second processor 402 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is less
than 5 dB, and therefore, the second processor 402 determines that the PBCH and the PHICH can
be supported during communication with the UE 1. If the second processor 402 determines that a
coverage enhancement value of UE 2 is 8 dB, that is, the coverage enhancement value of the UE 2
is greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB, the second processor 402 determines that the PBCH is
supported during communication with the UE 2, that is, it is determined the PHICH is not supported
during communication with the UE 2.
[0218]       Specifically, for another example, the second signal in the transmission signal set 1 is a
PUCCH (or a PHICH), and the second signal in the transmission signal set 2 is a null signal, that is,
the transmission signal set 2 does not include any signal. The base station or the system specifies in
advance that when a coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X
dB, transmission of the second signal in the signal set 1 is supported; and when the coverage
                                                   57

enhancement value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB),
transmission of the second signal in the signal set 2 is supported. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a
predefined feature parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10.
If the second processor 402 determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE 1 is 3 dB, that is,
it is determined that the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is less than 5 dB, the second
processor 402 determines that the PUCCH (or the PHICH) can be supported during communication
with the UE 1. If the second processor 402 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the
UE 1 is 8 dB, that is, the coverage enhancement value is greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB (or is
greater than 5 dB), the second processor 402 determines that transmission of the signal in the signal
set 1 is not supported during communication with the UE 1, that is, the PUCCH (or the PHICH) is
not supported during communication between the base station and the UE 1.
[0219]       For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third signal is: when a
coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the
base station supports a function in a first function set of the third signal; when the coverage
enhancement value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal
to Y dB), the base station supports a function in a second function of the third signal. Herein, X
and/or Y are/is a predefined feature threshold.
[0220]       If the second processor 402 determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE is X
dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the second processor 402 determines,
according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third
signal, that the function in the first function set of the third signal is supported. If the second
processor 402 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or is greater than
X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the second processor 402 determines,
according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third
signal, that the function in the second function set of the third signal is supported.
[0221]       More specifically, for example, the third signal is a PUCCH. The base station or the
system specifies in advance that functions in a first function set of the PUCCH include a function of
reporting channel quality information, a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back
an acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received; functions in a second
function set of the PUCCH include a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back an
acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received. Besides, the base station or the
system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than
or equal to X dB, the functions in the first function set of the third signal are supported; when the
                                                   58

coverage enhancement value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than
X dB), the functions in the second function set of the third signal are supported. Herein, X and/or Y
are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in advance that X=5,
and Y=10. If the second processor 402 determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE 1 is 3
dB, that is, it is determined that the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is less than 5 dB, the
second processor 402 determines tha the following functions of the PUCCH are supported during
communication with the UE 1: the function of reporting channel quality information, the scheduling
request function, and the function of feeding back an acknowledgement indicating whether a signal
is correctly received. If the second processor 402 determines that the coverage enhancement value
of the UE 1 is 8 dB, that is, it is determined that the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is
greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB (or is greater than 5 dB), the second processor 402 determines
that the scheduling request function and the function of feeding back an acknowledgement
indicating whether a signal is correctly         received of the PUCCH are supported           during
communication with the UE 1.
[0222]      It should be noted that the foregoing description of method implementation of this
embodiment is provided by using an example in which the feature parameter is a coverage
enhancement value. When the feature parameter is a level, a level index, a quantity of repetition
times, an index of a quantity of repetition times, a resource, a resource index, an enhancement level,
an enhancement level index, or other information (which reflects communication quality, channel
quality, or a service feature), implementation of this embodiment may be performed similarly
according to the foregoing description, and details are not described herein again.
[0223]      In this embodiment, according to a current feature parameter of UE and a preset
correspondence, a second processor may adaptively determine a coverage enhancement technology
used to transmit a first signal between the UE and the base station, and/or determine a second signal
of which transmission is supported between the UE and the base station, and/or determine a
supported function of a third signal, thereby adapting to different feature parameters of the UE, so
as to optimize resource utilization of a system, decrease processing complexity, and reduce power
consumption.
[0224]      The following describes a signal transmission method provided by the present invention.
Referring to FIG. 5, the method can be applied to the UE provided in FIG. 1 or FIG. 3, and an
embodiment of the signal transmission method of the present invention includes:
[0225]      501: UE determines a feature parameter of the UE.
[0226]      In this embodiment, the feature parameter of the UE refers to a value or information
used to measure communication quality of the UE, and/or a value or information used to measure
                                                   59

channel quality of the UE, and/or information used to reflect a service feature of the UE.
[0227]       Specifically, the feature parameter of the UE may include at least one of the following: a
resource, a resource index, a level, a level index, an enhancement level, an enhancement level index,
a repetition level, a repetition level index, a quantity of repetition times, an index of a quantity of
repetition times, a coverage enhancement value, an index of a coverage enhancement range, a path
loss value, an index of a path loss range, a reference signal received power value, an index of a
reference signal received power range, a reference signal received quality value, an index of a
reference signal received quality range, a channel quality information value, an index of a channel
quality information range, a service type, an index of a service type, a power saving requirement, an
index of a power saving requirement, a delay requirement, an index of a delay requirement, a
quantity of times of detecting a pre-specified channel, an index of a quantity of times of detecting a
pre-specified channel, a mobility requirement, and an index of a mobility requirement.
[0228]       The UE may determine the feature parameter of the UE according to received signaling
that indicates the feature parameter of the UE, where the signaling may be sent by another UE to the
UE of this embodiment, or may be sent by a base station or another network entity to the UE.
Alternatively, the UE determines the feature parameter of the UE according to whether a downlink
signal can be correctly received. For example, the UE sends an uplink signal to a base station, and if
the UE can correctly receive a corresponding downlink signal that is fed back by the base station,
the UE can determine a current feature parameter of the UE (for example, a feature parameter that
represents current communication quality). Alternatively, the UE determines the feature parameter
of the UE by measuring a received downlink signal. Alternatively, the UE determines the feature
parameter of the UE autonomously.
[0229]       502: According to the feature parameter of the UE and a preset correspondence, the UE
determines a coverage enhancement technology used by the UE to transmit a first signal, and/or
determines a second signal that the UE supports transmitting, and/or determines a function,
supported by the UE, of a third signal.
[0230]       In this embodiment, the preset correspondence may be a preset function relationship, a
preset table relationship, or a preset specification relationship, and the preset correspondence may
be preconfigured by a base station by using signaling or may be preset by a system by using a
standard protocol.
[0231]       The preset correspondence      refers to a preset correspondence between a feature
parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal, a preset
correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported,
and a preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third
                                                    60

signal.
[0232]        Specifically, the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal may be: if the feature parameter is
less than or equal to a feature parameter threshold, the UE uses a first coverage enhancement
technology to transmit the first signal, and if the feature parameter is greater than the feature
parameter threshold, the UE uses a second coverage enhancement technology to transmit the first
signal, where both the first coverage enhancement technology and the second coverage
enhancement technology are technologies for improving signal transmission reliability, and a main
difference between the two lies in that they can implement different converge enhancement
intensities.
[0233]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which
transmission is supported may be: if the feature parameter is less than or equal to the feature
parameter threshold, the UE supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1, and if the feature
parameter is greater than the feature parameter threshold, the UE supports transmitting a second
signal in a signal set 2, where the second signal in the signal set 1 and the second signal in the
signal set 2 are different, and the difference herein mainly refers to that the signal set 1 and the
second set 2 include different types of second signals, but the signal set 1 and the second set 2 may
include a same quantity of or different quantities of second signals.
[0234]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the
third signal may be: if the feature parameter is less than or equal to the feature parameter threshold,
the UE supports using a function in a first function set of the third signal, and if the feature
parameter is greater than the feature parameter threshold, the UE supports using a function in a
second function set of the third signal, where the function in the first function set and the function in
the second function set are not completely the same.
[0235]       Besides, the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal may also be: if the feature parameter
belongs to a first feature parameter set, the UE uses a first coverage enhancement technology to
transmit the first signal, and if the feature parameter belongs to a second feature parameter set, the
UE uses a second coverage enhancement technology to transmit the first signal, where both the first
coverage     enhancement technology and the second coverage enhancement technology                    are
technologies for improving signal transmission reliability, and a main difference between the two
lies in that they can implement different coverage enhancement intensities.
[0236]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which
transmission is supported may also be: if the feature parameter belongs to the first feature parameter
                                                   61

set, the UE supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1, and if the feature parameter
belongs to the second feature parameter set, the UE supports transmitting a second signal in a signal
set 2, where the second signal in the signal set 1 and the second signal in the signal set 2 are
different, and the difference herein mainly refers to that the signal set 1 and the second set 2 include
different types of second signals, but the signal set 1 and the second set 2 may include a same
quantity of or different quantities of second signals.
[0237]      The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the
third signal may also be: if the feature parameter belongs to the first feature parameter set, the UE
supports a function in a first function set of the third signal, and if the feature parameter belongs to
the second feature parameter set, the UE supports using a function in a second function set of the
third signal, where the function in the first function set and the function in the second function set
are not completely the same.
[0238]      The foregoing feature parameter threshold, signal set 1, signal set 2, first function set,
second function set, first feature parameter set, and second feature parameter set may be
preconfigured by the base station by using signaling or may be preset by the system by using a
standard protocol.
[0239]      For example, the signal set 2 includes fewer signal types than the signal set 1. The signal
set 1 or the signal set 2 may be an empty set. The signal set 1 and the signal set 2 may include
completely different signals, and in this case, if the UE supports transmission of a signal in the
signal set 2, it indicates that the UE does not support transmission of a signal in the signal set 1. The
signal set 1 or the signal set 2 includes one or more types of the following signals: a physical
downlink control channel, an enhanced physical downlink control channel, a physical random
access channel, a physical control format indicator channel, a physical hybrid automatic repeat
request indicator channel, a unicast physical downlink shared channel, a broadcast or multicast
physical downlink shared channel, a physical uplink shared channel, a physical uplink control
channel, a synchronization channel, a physical broadcast channel, a common reference signal, a
demodulation reference signal, a dedicated reference signal, a random access response message, a
random access response acknowledgment message, a contention resolution message, system
information, and a paging message.
[0240]      In addition, the first function set includes a larger quantity of functions than the second
function set. Specifically, for example, the third signal is a PUCCH, and the first function set and
the second function set include one or more of the following functions: a function of reporting
channel quality information, a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back an
acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received; however, the second function
                                                    62

set includes a smaller quantity of functions than the first function set.
[0241]       After determining the feature parameter of the UE, the UE may determine, according to
the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that
is used to transmit the first signal, a coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the
first signal and that corresponds to the feature parameter of the UE; and/or
             the UE determines, according to a preset correspondence between a feature parameter
and a second signal of which transmission is supported, a second signal to which the feature
parameter of the UE corresponds, wherein transmission of the second signal is supported by the
feature parameter; and/or
             the UE determines, according to the preset correspondence between a feature parameter
and a supported function of the third signal, a supported function that is corresponding to the feature
parameter of the UE and is of the third signal.
[0242]       The first signal, the second signal, and the third signal herein may be the same or may be
different. That is, the first signal and the second signal may be the same or may be different; the
first signal and the third signal may be the same or may be different; and the second signal and the
third signal may be the same or may be different.
[0243]       The first signal, the second signal, or the third signal includes at least one of the
following:
             a physical downlink control channel, an enhanced physical downlink control channel, a
physical random access channel, a physical control format indicator channel, a physical hybrid
automatic repeat request indicator channel, a unicast physical downlink shared channel, a broadcast
or multicast physical downlink shared channel, a physical uplink shared channel, a physical uplink
control channel, a synchronization channel, a physical broadcast channel, a common reference
signal, a demodulation reference signal, a dedicated reference signal, a random access response
message, a random access response acknowledgment message, a contention resolution message,
system information, and a paging message.
[0244]       By using an example in which the feature parameter of the UE is a coverage
enhancement value, the following describes determining, by the UE according to the feature
parameter of the UE and the preset correspondence, the coverage enhancement technology used by
the UE to transmit the first signal, and/or determining the second signal that the UE supports
transmitting, and/or determining the function, supported by the UE, of the third signal.
[0245]       For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to
transmit the first signal is: when a coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and
                                                     63

less than or equal to X dB), a first coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit the first
signal; when the coverage enhancement value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X
dB and less than or equal to Y dB), a second coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit
the first signal. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature threshold.
[0246]        If the UE determines that a coverage enhancement value of the UE is X dB (or is greater
than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the UE determines, according to the correspondence
between a feature parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the
first signal, that the first coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit the first signal. If the
UE determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or
is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the UE determines, according to the
correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to
transmit the first signal, that the second coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit the
first signal.
[0247]        In this embodiment, the first coverage enhancement technology and the second coverage
enhancement technology may be one of or a combination of multiple of the following technologies:
retransmission, spread spectrum transmission, low bit-rate transmission, transmission time interval
bundling (TTI bundling) transmission, power boosting (power boosting), power spectrum density
boosting (PSD boosting), keep trying (keep trying), relaxing requirement, frequency hopping, and
maximum likelihood detection.
[0248]        More specifically, for example, the first signal is a physical uplink control channel
PUCCH, and the base station or the system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement
value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB, the relaxing requirement (and/or
frequency hopping) is used to perform PUCCH coverage enhancement; when the coverage
enhancement value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), the
relaxing requirement (and/or frequency hopping) and repeated transmission are used to perform
PUCCH coverage enhancement. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold.
For example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If a coverage enhancement value of UE
1 is 3 dB, the UE 1 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is less than 5 dB,
and therefore, the UE 1 determines that the relaxing requirement (and/or frequency hopping) is used
to perform PUCCH coverage enhancement for the PUCCH. If a coverage enhancement value of UE
2 is 8 dB, that is, the UE 2 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE 2 is greater
than 5 dB and less than 10 dB (or is greater than 5 dB), the UE 2 determines that the relaxing
requirement (and/or frequency hopping) and repeated transmission are used to perform PUCCH
coverage enhancement for the PUCCH.
                                                    64

[0249]      Specifically, for another example, the first signal is a physical broadcast channel PBCH,
and the base station or the system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement value is C
dB, keep trying is used to perform PBCH coverage enhancement; when the coverage enhancement
value is D dB, keep trying and retransmission are used to perform PBCH coverage enhancement.
Herein, C and/or D are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in
advance that C=10, and D=15. If UE 1 determines that a coverage enhancement value of the UE 1
is 10 dB, the UE 1 determines that keep trying is used to perform PBCH coverage enhancement for
the PBCH, and the UE 1 keeps trying PBCH detection to detect the PBCH. If the UE 1 determines
that the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is 15 dB, the UE 1 determines that keep trying and
retransmission are used to perform PBCH coverage enhancement for the PBCH, and the UE 1
keeps trying repetition of PBCH detection to detect the PBCH.
[0250]      For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported is:
when a coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB),
the UE supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1; when the coverage enhancement
value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the
UE supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 2. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined
feature threshold.
[0251]      If the UE determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE is X dB (or is
greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the UE determines, according to the
correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported,
that transmission of the second signal in the signal set 1 is supported. If the UE determines that the
coverage enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and
less than or equal to Y dB), the UE determines, according to the correspondence between a feature
parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported, that transmission of the second
signal in the signal set 2 is supported.
[0252]      More specifically, for example, the second signal in the transmission signal set 1 is a
PBCH and a physical hybrid automatic repeat request indicator channel PHICH, and the second
signal in the signal set 2 is a PBCH. The base station or the system specifies in advance: when a
coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB, transmission of the
second signal in the transmission signal set 1 is supported; when the coverage enhancement value is
greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), transmission of the
second signal in the signal set 2 is supported. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature
parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If a coverage
                                                   65

enhancement value of UE 1 is 3 dB, the UE 1 determines that the coverage enhancement value of
the UE 1 is less than 5 dB, and therefore, the UE 1 determines that the PBCH and the PHICH can
be supported. If a coverage enhancement value of UE 2 is 8 dB, the UE 2 determines that the
coverage enhancement value of the UE 2 is greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB, and the UE 2
determines that the PBCH is supported, that is, the UE 2 determines that the PHICH is not
supported.
[0253]      Specifically, for another example, the second signal in the transmission signal set 1 is a
PUCCH (or a PHICH), and the second signal in the transmission signal set 2 is a null signal, that is,
the transmission signal set 2 does not include any signal. The base station or the system specifies in
advance: when a coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB,
transmission of the second signal in the signal set 1 is supported; when the coverage enhancement
value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), transmission of
the second signal in the signal set 2 is supported. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature
parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If a coverage
enhancement value of UE 1 is 3 dB, the UE 1 determines that the coverage enhancement value of
the UE 1 is less than 5 dB, and therefore, the UE 1 determines that the PUCCH (or the PHICH) can
be supported. If the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is 8 dB, the UE 1 determines that the
coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB (or is greater than
5 dB), and the UE 1 determines that transmission of the signal in the signal set 1 is not supported,
that is, UE 2 determines that the PUCCH (or the PHICH) is not supported.
[0254]      For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third signal is: when a
coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the
UE supports a function in a first function set of the third signal; when the coverage enhancement
value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the
UE supports a function in a second function of the third signal. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a
predefined feature threshold.
[0255]      If the UE determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE is X dB (or is
greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the UE determines, according to the
correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third signal, that the
function in the first function set of the third signal is supported. If the UE determines that the
coverage enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and
less than or equal to Y dB), the UE determines, according to the correspondence between a feature
parameter and a supported function of the third signal, that the function in the second function set of
                                                  66

the third signal is supported.
[0256]      More specifically, for example, the third signal is a PUCCH. The base station or the
system specifies in advance that functions in a first function set of the PUCCH include a function of
reporting channel quality information, a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back
an acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received; functions in a second
function set of the PUCCH include a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back an
acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received. Besides, the base station or the
system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than
or equal to X dB, the functions in the first function set of the third signal are supported; when the
coverage enhancement value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than
X dB), the functions in the second function set of the third signal are supported. Herein, X and/or Y
are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in advance that X=5,
and Y=10. If a coverage enhancement value of UE 1 is 3 dB, that is, the UE 1 determines that the
coverage enhancement value of UE 1 is less than 5 dB, the UE 1 determines that the following
functions of the PUCCH are supported: the function of reporting channel quality information, the
scheduling request function, and the function of feeding back an acknowledgement indicating
whether a signal is correctly received. If the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is 8 dB, that
is, the UE 1 determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is greater than 5 dB and
less than 10 dB (or is greater than 5 dB), the UE 1 determines to support the scheduling request
function and the function of feeding back an acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is
correctly received of the PUCCH.
[0257]      It should be noted that the foregoing description of method implementation of this
embodiment is provided by using an example in which the feature parameter is a coverage
enhancement value. When the feature parameter is a level, a level index, a quantity of repetition
times, an index of a quantity of repetition times, a resource, a resource index, an enhancement level,
an enhancement level index, or other information (which reflects communication quality, channel
quality, or a service feature), implementation of this embodiment may be performed similarly
according to the foregoing description, and details are not described herein again.
[0258]      The "transmission" in this embodiment refers to sending or receiving. The "transmit" in
this embodiment refers to send or receive.
[0259]      In this embodiment, according to a current feature parameter of UE and a preset
correspondence, the UE may adaptively determine a coverage enhancement technology used to
transmit a first signal between the UE and a base station, and/or determine a second signal of which
transmission is supported between the UE and a base station, and/or determine a supported function
                                                   67

of a third signal, thereby adapting to different feature parameters, so as to optimize resource
utilization of a system, decrease processing complexity, and reduce power consumption.
[0260]       The following describes another embodiment of a signal transmission method provided
by the present invention. Referring to FIG. 6, the method can be applied to the base station provided
in FIG. 2 or FIG. 4, and the signal transmission method of this embodiment includes:
[0261]       601: A base station determines a feature parameter of UE.
[0262]       The UE in this embodiment refers to UE that communicates with the base station; in this
embodiment, the feature parameter of the UE refers to a value or information used to measure
communication quality of the UE, and/or a value or information used to measure channel quality of
the UE, and/or information used to reflect a service feature of the UE.
[0263]       Specifically, the feature parameter of the UE may include at least one of the following: a
resource, a resource index, a level, a level index, an enhancement level, an enhancement level index,
a repetition level, a repetition level index, a quantity of repetition times, an index of a quantity of
repetition times, a coverage enhancement value, an index of a coverage enhancement range, a path
loss value, an index of a path loss range, a reference signal received power value, an index of a
reference signal received power range, a reference signal received quality value, an index of a
reference signal received quality range, a channel quality information value, an index of a channel
quality information range, a service type, an index of a service type, a power saving requirement, an
index of a power saving requirement, a delay requirement, an index of a delay requirement, a
quantity of times of detecting a pre-specified channel, an index of a quantity of times of detecting a
pre-specified channel, a mobility requirement, and an index of a mobility requirement.
[0264]       The base station may determine the feature parameter of the UE according to received
signaling that indicates the feature parameter of the UE, where the signaling may be sent by the UE
or another network entity to the base station. Alternatively, the base station determines the feature
parameter of the UE according to whether an uplink signal can be correctly received. For example,
the base station sends a downlink signal to the UE, and if the base station can correctly receive a
corresponding uplink signal that is fed back by the UE, the base station can determine a current
feature parameter      of the UE (for example, a feature parameter that represents current
communication quality). Alternatively, the base station determines the feature parameter of the UE
by measuring a received uplink signal. Alternatively, the base station determines the feature
parameter of the UE autonomously.
[0265]       602: According to the feature parameter of the UE and a preset correspondence, the base
station determines a coverage enhancement technology used by the base station to transmit a first
signal, and/or determines a second signal that the base station supports transmitting, and/or
                                                    68

determines a function, supported by the base station, of a third signal.
[0266]      In this embodiment, the preset correspondence may be a preset function relationship, a
preset table relationship, or a preset specification relationship, and the preset correspondence may
be preconfigured by the base station by using signaling or may be preset by a system by using a
standard protocol.
[0267]      The preset correspondence refers to a preset correspondence between a feature
parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal, a preset
correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported,
and a preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third
signal.
[0268]      Specifically, the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage
enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal may be: if the feature parameter is
less than or equal to a feature parameter threshold, the base station uses a first coverage
enhancement technology to transmit the first signal, and if the feature parameter is greater than the
feature parameter threshold, the base station uses a second coverage enhancement technology to
transmit the first signal, where both the first coverage enhancement technology and the second
coverage enhancement technology are technologies for improving signal transmission reliability,
and a main difference between the two lies in that they can implement different converge
enhancement intensities.
[0269]      The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which
transmission is supported may be: if the feature parameter is less than or equal to the feature
parameter threshold, the base station supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1, and if
the feature parameter is greater than the feature parameter threshold, the base station supports
transmitting a second signal in a signal set 2, where the second signal in the signal set 1 and the
second signal in the signal set 2 are different, and the difference herein mainly refers to that the
signal set 1 and the second set 2 include different types of second signals, but the signal set 1 and
the second set 2 may include a same quantity of or different quantities of second signals.
[0270]      The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the
third signal may be: if the feature parameter is less than or equal to the feature parameter threshold,
the base station supports using a function in a first function set of the third signal, and if the feature
parameter is greater than the feature parameter threshold, the base station supports using a function
in a second function set of the third signal, where the function in the first function set and the
function in the second function set are not completely the same.
[0271]      Besides, the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage
                                                   69

enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal may also be: if the feature parameter
belongs to a first feature parameter set, the base station uses a first coverage enhancement
technology to transmit the first signal, and if the feature parameter belongs to a second feature
parameter set, the base station uses a second coverage enhancement technology to transmit the first
signal, where both the first coverage enhancement technology and the second coverage
enhancement technology are technologies for improving signal transmission reliability, and a main
difference between the two lies in that they can implement different coverage enhancement
intensities.
[0272]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which
transmission is supported may also be: if the feature parameter belongs to the first feature parameter
set, the base station supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1, and if the feature
parameter belongs to the second feature parameter set, the base station supports transmitting a
second signal in a signal set 2, where the second signal in the signal set 1 and the second signal in
the signal set 2 are different, and the difference herein mainly refers to that the signal set 1 and the
second set 2 include different types of second signals, but the signal set 1 and the second set 2 may
include a same quantity of or different quantities of second signals.
[0273]       The preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the
third signal may also be: if the feature parameter belongs to the first feature parameter set, the base
station supports a function in a first function set of the third signal, and if the feature parameter
belongs to the second feature parameter set, the base station supports using a function in a second
function set of the third signal, where the function in the first function set and the function in the
second function set are not completely the same.
[0274]       The foregoing feature parameter threshold, signal set 1, signal set 2, first function set,
second function set, first feature parameter set, and second feature parameter set may be
preconfigured by the base station by using signaling or may be preset by the system by using a
standard protocol.
[0275]       For example, the signal set 2 includes fewer signal types than the signal set 1. The signal
set 1 or the signal set 2 may be an empty set. The signal set 1 and the signal set 2 may include
completely different signals, and in this case, if the base station supports transmission of a signal in
the signal set 2, it indicates that the base station does not support transmission of a signal in the
signal set 1. The signal set 1 or the signal set 2 includes one or more types of the following signals:
a physical downlink control channel, an enhanced physical downlink control channel, a physical
random access channel, a physical control format indicator channel, a physical hybrid automatic
repeat request indicator channel, a unicast physical downlink shared channel, a broadcast or
                                                    70

multicast physical downlink shared channel, a physical uplink shared channel, a physical uplink
control channel, a synchronization channel, a physical broadcast channel, a common reference
signal, a demodulation reference signal, a dedicated reference signal, a random access response
message, a random access response acknowledgment message, a contention resolution message,
system information, and a paging message.
[0276]       In addition, the first function set includes a larger quantity of functions than the second
function set. Specifically, for example, the third signal is a PUCCH, and the first function set and
the second function set include one or more of the following functions: a function of reporting
channel quality information, a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back an
acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received; however, the second function
set includes a smaller quantity of functions than the first function set.
[0277]       After determining the feature parameter of the UE, the base station may determine,
according to the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage enhancement
technology that is used to transmit the first signal, a coverage enhancement technology that is used
to transmit the first signal and that corresponds to the feature parameter of the UE; and/or
             the base station determines, according to the preset correspondence between a feature
parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported, a second signal           to which the
feature parameter of the UE corresponds, wherein transmission of the second signal is supported by
the feature parameter; and/or
             the base station determines, according to the preset correspondence between a feature
parameter and a supported function of the third signal, a supported function that is corresponding to
the feature parameter of the UE and is of the third signal.
[0278]       The first signal, the second signal, and the third signal herein may be the same or may be
different. That is, the first signal and the second signal may be the same or may be different; the
first signal and the third signal may be the same or may be different; and the second signal and the
third signal may be the same or may be different.
[0279]       The first signal, the second signal, or the third signal includes at least one of the
following:
             a physical downlink control channel, an enhanced physical downlink control channel, a
physical random access channel, a physical control format indicator channel, a physical hybrid
automatic repeat request indicator channel, a unicast physical downlink shared channel, a broadcast
or multicast physical downlink shared channel, a physical uplink shared channel, a physical uplink
control channel, a synchronization channel, a physical broadcast channel, a common reference
signal, a demodulation reference signal, a dedicated reference signal, a random access response
                                                     71

message, a random access response acknowledgment message, a contention resolution message,
system information, and a paging message.
[0280]       By using an example in which the feature parameter of the UE is a coverage
enhancement value, the following describes determining, by the base station according to the
feature parameter of the UE and the preset correspondence, the coverage enhancement technology
used by the base station to transmit the first signal, and/or determining the second signal that the
base station supports transmitting, and/or determining the function, supported by the base station, of
the third signal.
[0281]       For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to
transmit the first signal is: when a coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and
less than or equal to X dB), a first coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit the first
signal; when the coverage enhancement value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X
dB and less than or equal to Y dB), a second coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit
the first signal. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature threshold.
[0282]       If the base station determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE is X dB (or is
greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the base station determines, according to the
correspondence between a feature parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to
transmit the first signal, that the first coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit the first
signal during communication with the UE. If the base station determines that the coverage
enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than
or equal to Y dB), the base station determines, according to the correspondence between a feature
parameter and a coverage enhancement technology that is used to transmit the first signal, that the
second coverage enhancement technology is used to transmit the first signal during communication
with the UE.
[0283]       In this embodiment, the first coverage enhancement technology and the second coverage
enhancement technology may be one of or a combination of multiple of the following technologies:
retransmission, spread spectrum transmission, low bit-rate transmission, transmission time interval
bundling (TTI bundling) transmission, power boosting (power boosting), power spectrum density
boosting (PSD boosting), keep trying (keep trying), relaxing requirement, frequency hopping, and
maximum likelihood detection.
[0284]       More specifically, for example, the first signal is a physical uplink control channel
PUCCH, and the base station or the system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement
value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB, the relaxing requirement (and/or
                                                    72

frequency hopping) is used to perform PUCCH coverage enhancement; when the coverage
enhancement value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), the
relaxing requirement (and/or frequency hopping) and repeated transmission are used to perform
PUCCH coverage enhancement. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold.
For example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If the base station determines that a
coverage enhancement value of UE 1 is 3 dB, the base station determines that the coverage
enhancement value of the UE 1 is less than 5 dB, and therefore, the base station determines that
relaxing requirement (and/or frequency hopping) is used to perform PUCCH coverage enhancement
for the PUCCH, and the base station correspondingly receives the PUCCH in this manner. If the
base station determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE 2 is 8 dB, the base station
determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE 2 is greater than 5 dB and less than 10
dB (or is greater than 5 dB), and therefore, the base station determines that relaxing requirement
(and/or frequency hopping) and repeated transmission are used to perform PUCCH coverage
enhancement for the PUCCH, and the base station correspondingly receives the PUCCH in this
manner.
[0285]       Specifically, for another example, the first signal is a physical broadcast channel PBCH,
and the base station or the system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement value is not
greater than C dB, keep trying is used to perform PBCH coverage enhancement; when the coverage
enhancement value is not greater than D dB, keep trying and retransmission are used to perform
PBCH coverage enhancement. Herein, C and/or D are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold.
For example, it is specified in advance that C=10, and D=15. If the base station determines that a
current coverage enhancement value of UE (one UE or multiple UEs) is not greater than 10 dB, the
base station determines that keep trying is used to perform PBCH coverage enhancement for the
PBCH. If the base station determines that a current coverage enhancement value of UE (one UE or
multiple UEs) is not greater than 15 dB, the base station determines that keep trying and
retransmission are used to perform PBCH coverage enhancement for the PBCH.
[0286]      For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported is:
when a coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB),
the base station supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 1; when the coverage
enhancement value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal
to Y dB), the base station supports transmitting a second signal in a signal set 2. Herein, X and/or Y
are/is a predefined feature threshold.
[0287]      If the base station determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE is X dB (or is
                                                   73

greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the base station determines, according to the
correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of which transmission is supported,
that transmission of the second signal in the signal set 1 is supported during communication with
the UE. If the base station determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or is
greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB), the base station
determines, according to the correspondence between a feature parameter and a second signal of
which transmission is supported, that transmission of the second signal in the signal set 2 is
supported during communication with the UE.
[0288]      More specifically, for example, the second signal in the transmission signal set 1 is a
PBCH and a physical hybrid automatic repeat request indicator channel PHICH, and the second
signal in the signal set 2 is a PBCH. The base station or the system specifies in advance: when a
coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB, transmission of the
second signal in the transmission signal set 1 is supported; when the coverage enhancement value is
greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), transmission of the
second signal in the signal set 2 is supported. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature
parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If a coverage
enhancement value of UE 1 is 3 dB, the base station determines that the coverage enhancement
value of the UE 1 is less than 5 dB, and therefore, the base station determines that the PBCH and
the PHICH can be supported during communication with the UE 1. If the base station determines
that a coverage enhancement value of UE 2 is 8 dB, the base station determines that the coverage
enhancement value of the UE 2 is greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB, and the base station
determines that the PBCH is supported during communication with the UE 2, that is, it is
determined that the PHICH is not supported during communication with the UE 2.
[0289]      Specifically, for another example, the second signal in the transmission signal set 1 is a
PUCCH (or a PHICH), and the second signal in the transmission signal set 2 is a null signal, that is,
the transmission signal set 2 does not include any signal. The base station or the system specifies in
advance: when a coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB,
transmission of the second signal in the signal set 1 is supported; when the coverage enhancement
value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than X dB), transmission of
the second signal in the signal set 2 is supported. Herein, X and/or Y are/is a predefined feature
parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in advance that X=5, and Y=10. If the base station
determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE 1 is 3 dB, the base station determines that the
coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is less than 5 dB, and therefore, the base station
determines that the PUCCH (or the PHICH) can be supported during communication with the UE 1.
                                                   74

If the base station determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is 8 dB, the base
station determines that the coverage enhancement value of the UE 1 is greater than 5 dB and less
than 10 dB (or is greater than 5 dB), and the base station determines that transmission of the signal
in the signal set 1 is not supported during communication with the UE 1, that is, the PUCCH (or the
PHICH) is not supported during communication between the base station and the UE 1.
[0290]      For example, the preset correspondence, specified by the base station or the system in
advance, between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third signal is: when a
coverage enhancement value is X dB (or is greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the
base station supports a function in a first function set of the third signal; when the coverage
enhancement value is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB and less than or equal
to Y dB), the base station supports a function in a second function of the third signal. Herein, X
and/or Y are/is a predefined feature threshold.
[0291]      If the base station determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE is X dB (or is
greater than 0 dB and less than or equal to X dB), the base station determines, according to the
correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third signal, that the
function in the first function set of the third signal is supported. If the base station determines that
the coverage enhancement value of the UE is Y dB (or is greater than X dB, or is greater than X dB
and less than or equal to Y dB), the base station determines, according to the correspondence
between a feature parameter and a supported function of the third signal, that the function in the
second function set of the third signal is supported.
[0292]      More specifically, for example, the third signal is a PUCCH. The base station or the
system specifies in advance that functions in a first function set of the PUCCH include a function of
reporting channel quality information, a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back
an acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received; functions in a second
function set of the PUCCH include a scheduling request function, and a function of feeding back an
acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received. Besides, the base station or the
system specifies in advance: when a coverage enhancement value is greater than 0 dB and less than
or equal to X dB, the functions in the first function set of the third signal are supported; when the
coverage enhancement value is greater than X dB and less than or equal to Y dB (or is greater than
X dB), the functions in the second function set of the third signal are supported. Herein, X and/or Y
are/is a predefined feature parameter threshold. For example, it is specified in advance that X=5,
and Y=10. If the base station determines that a coverage enhancement value of UE 1 is 3 dB, the
base station determines that the coverage enhancement value of UE 1 is less than 5 dB, and
therefore, the base station determines that the following functions of the PUCCH are supported
                                                    75

during communication with the UE 1: the function of reporting channel quality information, the
scheduling request function, and the function of feeding back an acknowledgement indicating
whether a signal is correctly received. If the base station determines that the coverage enhancement
value of the UE 1 is 8 dB, the base station determines that the coverage enhancement value of the
UE 1 is greater than 5 dB and less than 10 dB (or is greater than 5 dB), and the base station
determines    that the    scheduling  request function     and the    function   of feeding back an
acknowledgement indicating whether a signal is correctly received of the PUCCH are supported
during communication with the UE 1.

embodiment is provided by using an example in which the feature parameter is a coverage
enhancement value. When the feature parameter is a level, a level index, a quantity of repetition
times, an index of a quantity of repetition times, a resource, a resource index, an enhancement level,
an enhancement level index, or other information (which reflects communication quality, channel
quality, or a service feature), implementation of this embodiment may be performed similarly
according to the foregoing description, and details are not described herein again.
[0294]      The "transmission" in this embodiment refers to sending or receiving. The "transmit" in
this embodiment refers to send or receive.
[0295]      In this embodiment, according to a current feature parameter of UE and a preset
correspondence, a base station may adaptively determine a coverage enhancement technology used
to transmit a first signal between the UE and the base station, and/or determine a second signal of
which transmission is supported between the UE and the base station, and/or determine a supported
function of a third signal, thereby adapting to different feature parameters of the UE, so as to
optimize resource utilization of a system, decrease processing complexity, and reduce power
consumption.

determining, by the base station, the feature parameter of the UE by measuring a received uplink
signal, or determining, by the base station, the feature parameter of the UE autonomously.
     21. The signal transmission method according to claim 19, wherein the preset correspondence
is a preset function relationship, a preset table relationship, or a preset specification relationship,
and the preset correspondence is preconfigured by the base station by using signaling or is preset by
a system.
     22. The signal transmission method according to claim 21, wherein the preset correspondence
between a feature parameter and a first signal of which transmission is supported is: if the feature
parameter belongs to the first feature parameter set, the base station supports transmitting a first
signal in a signal set 1, and if the feature parameter belongs to the second feature parameter set, the
base station supports transmitting a first signal in a signal set 2, wherein the first signal in the signal
set 1 and the first signal in the signal set 2 are different; and
     the preset correspondence between a feature parameter and a supported function of a second
signal is: if the feature parameter belongs to the first feature parameter set, the base station supports
a function in a first function set of the second signal, and if the feature parameter belongs to the

the second signal, wherein the function in the first function set and the function in the second
function set are not completely the same.
     23. The signal transmission method according to claim 19, wherein the first signal and the
second signal are the same or different.
     24. The signal transmission method according to claim 23, wherein the first signal or the
second signal comprises at least one of the following:
     a physical downlink control channel, an enhanced physical downlink control channel, a
physical random access channel, a physical control format indicator channel, a physical hybrid
automatic repeat request indicator channel, a unicast physical downlink shared channel, a broadcast
or multicast physical downlink shared channel, a physical uplink shared channel, a physical uplink
control channel, a synchronization channel, a physical broadcast channel, a common reference
signal, a demodulation reference signal, a dedicated reference signal, a random access response
message, a random access response acknowledgment message, a contention resolution message,
system information, and a paging message.
