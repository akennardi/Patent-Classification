 1     Public Domain Work
The formula for the complex square root, taken from [6] is:
    The square roots of a + bi (with b! = 0) are +(7 + 6i), where
               2
                  2
    In the author's Wikipedia math blog[1], an analogue of the complex
square root theorum is shown. This is public domain knowledge, except
for the parts where reference is given to Innovation Patents the author has
taken out.
    There is also work on this page that establishes the concept of a modular
tessarine, that is a tesserine that is expressed in modular arithmetic.
    Quoting from [1]:
       Cockle's Tessarines very close to Modular Quaternions
       After some research in the Wikipedia, it does seem that the
       imaginary units I have put forth have been written of already as
       the Wikipedia Bicomplex number article or tessarines by James
       Cockle (lawyer) in 1848.
       Quoting from the Wikipedia Bicomplex[7] number article:
            In 1848 James Cockle introduced the "'tessarines"' in
            a series of articles in "Philosophical Magazine".
            A "'tessarine"' is a hypercomplex number of the form
            :t = w + xi + yj+ zk where w, x, y, z are Real numbers.
            where ij = ji = k, i 2 = -1,       j 2 = +1. Cockle used
            tessarines to isolate the hyperbolic cosine series and the
            hyperbolic sine series in the exponential series. He also
            showed how [[zero divisorl]s arise in tessarines, inspir
            ing him to use the term "impossibles." The tessarines
            are now best known for their subalgebra of "'real tes
            sarines"' t = w+yj , also called split-complex numbers,
            which express the parametrization of the unit hyper
            bola.
                                          2

      In the case of modular tessarines, then i =      -11 mod p * q, j =
        lE mod p * q and k =      -l2 mod p * q.
      An analogue to Tessarines are bicomplex numbers[7], introduced
      in 1892 by Corrado Segre.
    Quoting the imaginary multiplication table from the Wikipedia Bicom
plex number article[7]:
      1.1     Tessarine multiplication
                                      1    i  j   k
                                11         i  j   k
                                i i      -1   k  -j

      1.2     Modular Tessarine multiplication
      I have constructed the slightly different imaginary multiplication
      table for a modular tessarines mod p*q (p and q are 1 mod 4
      primes) where =       -l 1 mod p * q, j =      lmod p * q, and k =
         12 mod p * q:
                                     1    i   j    k

    Quoting again from [1]:
      1.3 The Modular Quaternion(Tessarines) Worked
      Out And Demonstrated
      I was able to come up with an analogue, for this Quaternion-like
      system, for both the conjugate, the form, and the multiplicative
                                           3

inverse. Given / 1 mod p * q -i, v [-12mod p * q                j  and
vI mod p * q      k, then the conjugate of (a + b * i + c * j + d * k)
would be:
(a - b * i - c *j+ d * k)
There is a norm to this (which isn't great) of:
(a2 + b2 + C2 + d2 - 2 * v/1* (b * c - a * d))
and so the multiplicative inverse is:
                              2      2 +c 2    2 -2*   1*(b    c-a
(a-b*i-c*j+d*k)*(a               +b         +d
d))-' mod p * q
(It can be seen from the above definition that the norm of modular
quarternions where a = b = c = d, or b * c == a * d, is indeed the
norm of quaternions: a 2 + b2 + c 2 + d 2 and thus, looking at the
definition of the quad root of 1 mod p*q, as a modular quaternion
(see above), the norm is (1/2)2 + (1/2)2 + (1/2)2 + (1/2)2 = 1.
This makes the quad root of 1 a unit quaternion. I suspect that
all roots of 1 have norms of 1, since the cube root of 1 also has a
norm of 1)
Since we know the norm of the quad root of 1 to be 1, we can
take a stab at the inverse of the quad root of 1:
In[61:= Mod[PowerMod[2,         -1,   89 291    (1 + 568 + 945 + 2493), 89 291
Out[61= 713
In[71:= PowerMod[713, -1, 89 291
Out[71= 1781
and the inverse of the quad root of 1 is:
In[91:= Mod[(1 - 568 - 945 + 2493) PowerMod[2, -1, 89 291,
 89 291
Out[91= 1781
                                    4

Thus the inverse of the quad root of 1, after considering it as a
modular quaternion, is:
2* (1 -     -11 -  V   2+ vTI *4    mod p * q - (1 -     - I) * (I
     12) * 2
See User:Endo999#TheCubeRootOfIDefinedInPolarCoordinates
for the cube root of -I shown as a quaternion, and it's inverse suc
cessfully computed.
An example, showing a conjugate, norm, and multiplicative in
verse, follows:
A modular quaternion for 89 * 29 is:
(29 + 13 * 568 + 17 * 945 + 23 * 2493) mod 89 * 29      806
The conjugate is:
(29 - 13 * 568 - 17 * 945 + 23 * 2493) mod 89 * 29      366
The norm(it's odd) is:
(292+132+172+232-2*2493*(13*17-29*23))           mod 89 * 29 - 762
and the multiplicative inverse of quaternion 806, given above, is:
(29 + 13 * 568 + 17 * 945 + 23 * 2493)     mod 89 * 29 - 806-1
366 * 762-'      285
Multiplication follows the following rule:
Mod[(29 + 13 568 + 17 945 + 23 2493)           (39 + 23 568 + 27 945 +
      33 2493),    89 291==2172
In [151:=
Mod[k (a w + b x + c y + d z) + j ( -b w + a x - d y + c z) +
     i (-c w - d x + a y + b z) + d w - c x - b y + a z,
   89 291 /. {k -> 2493, i -> 568, j -> 945, a -> 29, b -> 13,         c -> 17,
    d -> 23, z -> 39, y -> 23, x -> 27, w -> 33}
Out[151= 2172
                                 5

      It is somewhat similar to the Hamilton Product but is different
      regarding the non i,j,k items.
      There are some minor differences, but mostly the same for the
      two systems.
2     Prior Work
Two Australian Innovation Patents will provide the main method of taking
square roots of
   1. Quaternions, i., Q = a + b *i + c *j        d * k where i* j* k = -1 and
      12     2 = k2     _i
   2. Tessarines. ie., T = a+b*i+c*j          +d*k where *j =j*i        = k and
      j2 = +1
   3. Modular Tessarines (described in the public domain section)., T mod
      P *q
   4. split complex numbers, (described in the public domain section)., a +
      b*  j where  j2 =  i
    The two Australian Innovation Patents, written by the author of this
patent, which describe a means of populating the Complex Square Root
formula with the parameters of Pythagorean Triples, are:
   1. #<removed-apn>: The Complex Square Root Formula In Modular Arith
      metic And Pythagorean Triples
   2. #<removed-apn>: The Complex Square Root Formula In Modular Arith
      metic And Pythagorean Triples, Part B
    The two Innovation Patents describe how the three parameters of the
Pythagorean Triple (a 2 +b 2 = c 2 ) are, according to Euclid's famous formulas:
   1. a=2*m*n
                  2
   2. b=m 2    _n
                                          6

                     2
   3. c=m 2 -n
    As such, for each Pythagorean Triple,
   1. a-+c=2*m*n+m 2             +n  2
                                       = (m + n) 2 . Thus (a+c) =m+nisan
       integer where a and c are integers
   2. c-a= m 2 +n 2 -2*m*n=(m-n) 2. Thus                  (c-  a) =m-nisan
       integer where a and c are integers.
    As such, all the intermediate calculations of the Complex Square Root
formula reduce to natural squares, thus, modular square roots need not be
taken. Thus, the Complex Square Root formula immediately reveals the
square root of a modular complex number where the REAL and IMAGIN
ERY coefficients are taken from Pythagorean Triples when one of the square
roots of -1 mod p*q is known. (Please see either of the patents quoted for 4
examples of this).
    The two patents describe a mapping between a square and its root for
p*q 1 mod 4 semiprimes modula, once one of the two square roots of -1 is
known.
    Thus, to summarize the method of the two quoted patents:
    If a 2 + b2 = c 2 where a, b and c are natural numbers, then if a = 2 * m * n
via the famous Pythagorean formula for Pythagorean Triples, then:
   1. aroot =      (c + a) = (m + n)
   2. broot =     (c - a) = (m - n)
    so that the square 2(a     + b * v-1) mod p * q has the root: aroot + broot *
v   Tmod p * q
3      The Inventive Work
Since the two patents quoted above show how to take the modular square root
of a modular complex number, when the coefficients of that complex number
are populated by Pythagorean Triples, then it follows that this method can
be applied to any number construct where
    a + b * X where X 2 = _1.
                                          7

3.1      Square Roots Of Some Quaternions Taken
So for the Quaternions it could be applied for each of the three imaginary
numbers (i, j, k) since
      2    2 = k2 = -i
     So the method of taking the square root could be applied to a Quaternion
of the form:
     (a1 + b1 * i) * (a 2 + b2 * j) * (a3 + b3 * k)
    as long as all the a's and b's are part of Pythagorean Triples.
    Thus (a1 + b1 * i) * (a 2 + b2 *j) could be a root, or (a1 + b1 *j) * (a 2 + b2 *j)
could also be a root.
Examples Showing some mathematica computations to show examples of
this math above, note that:
    1. 32+42 =52
   2. a = 4, b= 3
   3. V4-+5 =3 = a
   4. /5-4= 1=           b1
    Thus v8+6*i = 3+1*i
<< Quaternions'             (*load quaternion package$)
In[31:= Quaternion[3, 1, 0, 01 ** Quaternion[3, 1, 0, 01
Out[31= Quaternion[8,           6, 0,   01
    1. 52 + 122 = 132
   2. a = 12, b = 5
   3. v13 +12      = 5 = ai
   4. /13 -12      = 1 = b1
    Thus v24+10*i =5+1*
                                            8

In[41:= Quaternion[5, 1, 0, 01 ** Quaternion[5, 1, 0, 01
Out[41= Quaternion[24, 10, 0, 01
   This can happen for the other imaginary terms too. In this case k will
be shown:
 In[51:= Quaternion[5,      0,  0, 11 ** Quaternion[5,     0, 0, 11
 Out[51= Quaternion[24, 0, 0, 101
   Any combination of Pythagorean Triple inspired terms can be squares
and roots as well:
 In[71:=
Quaternion[5, 0, 0, 11 ** Quaternion[5, 0, 0, 11 **
 Quaternion[3, 1, 0, 01 ** Quaternion[3, 1, 0, 01
 Out[71= Quaternion[192, 144, 60, 801
 In[8]:= Quaternion[24, 0, 0, 101 ** Quaternion[8, 6, 0, 01
 Out[81= Quaternion[192, 144, 60, 801
3.2     Square Roots Of Some Tessarines Taken
Says [7] on the equivalance of Tessarines and Bicomplex numbers:
      In 1892 Corrado Segre introduced bicomplex numbers in Mathe
      matische Annalen, which form an algebra isomorphic to the tes
      sarines.
      Corrado Segre read W. R. Hamilton's Lectures on Quaternions
      (1853) and the works of W. K. Clifford. Segre used some of
      Hamilton's notation to develop his system of bicomplex numbers:
      Let h and i be elements that square to -1 and that commute.
      Then, presuming associativity of multiplication, the product hi
                                      9

        must square to +1. The algebra constructed on the basis 1, h,
        i, hi is then the same as James Cockle's tessarines, represented
        using a different basis.
    For the Tessarines where j 2 = 1 a slight modification needs to be taken.
     Since (a + b * 1)2 = a 2 + 2 * a * b * i - b2 when 42 = -1, but when, as in
the tessarine case, J = 1 and 42 = 2 = -1(i and k are equivalent to h and
i of Segre's system) then
     (a + b * j) 2 = a 2 + 2 * a * b * j + b2 therefore the relationship between the
square and the square root is:
     (a 1 + b1 * j) 2 = 2 * (a + b2 + b * j) We need to add twice the imaginary
coefficient squared of the root into the square.
Examples
    1. 32+42=52
   2. a = 4, b= 3
   3. V4-+5=3= a
   4. /5-4=        1=     b1
    Thus v8+6*i= 3+1*I
Tessarine[3, 1, 0,           01 *Tessarine[3,       1, 0, 01=Tessarine[8,       6, 0, 01
    This will be the same for the imaginary k as for i, however,        j is different
    1. 52 + 122    =  132
   2. a = 12, b = 5
   3.     r13+12 = 5 = a
   4.     /13 -12   = 1 = b1
    Thus v24+2+10O*i = 5+ 1 *i
                                             10

Tessarine[5, 0, 1, 01 *Tessarine[5, 0, 1, 01
Tessarine[26, 0,             10,     01
    This can happen for the other imaginary terms too. In this case k will
be shown:
Tessarine[5, 0, 0, 11                 * Tessarine[5, 0, 0,           11=Tessarine[24,        0,  0, 101
3.3       Square Roots Of Some Modular Tessarines Taken
Since the Modular Tessarine is similar to the Tessarine except for a slightly
different multiplication table between the three imaginary units, then the
reasoning and equations are the same for modular tessarines as for tessarines.
    When we try to multiply the different nodes of the tessarines, such as
     ((a1, 1 + bi, 1 * i) * (a 2 ,1 + b2 ,1 * j)) 2
                                                    = (2* (a1 + bi *i) * 2* (a 2 + b21 + b2 *j))
3.4       Square Roots Of Split Complex Numbers Taken
Since the split complex number, (a + b * j where j 2 = 1) is a subalgebra of
the Tessarines, with one imaginary unit instead of three, the same square
root procedures of tessarines hold.
     (a 1 + b1 * j)2 = 2 * (a + b2 + b * j) We need to add twice the imaginary
coefficient squared of the root into the square.
    This will be the same for the imaginary k as for i, however, j is different
Examples
    1. modulus=89 * 29
   2. 1                 -568
   3. j       v1       2493
   4. k              22Z945
   5. 52 + 122       =  132
   6. a = 12, b       =  5
                                                     11

   7.   /13-+ 12= 5 =a    1
   8. V/13 -12=      1 =b 1
    Thus    2 * (12  + 1 + 5 * 2493) = 5 + 1 * 2493 and
In[91:= Mod[26 + 10 2493,         89 291
Out [91= 1727
In[121:= Mod[(5 + 2493)^2, 89 291
Out[121= 1727
    The examples for (ai + b1 * V/1o,2)2 mod p * q - 2(a + b /110,2) can
be seen in the prior patents quoted above.
    The modular case for j or / mod p * q is shown below:
   1. modulus=89 * 29
   2.                568
   3.        1     2493
   4. k          22Z945
   5. 282 + 452 = 532
   6. a = 28, b = 45
   7. v/28 +53 = 9 = a1
   8. v/53 -28    = 5= b
    Thus    2 * (28 + 5 * 5 + 5 * 2493) = 9 + 5 * 2493 and
                                        12

In[41:= Mod[2 (28 + 5 5 + 45 2493),             89 291
Out[41= 2510
In[21:= Mod[(9 + 5 2493)^2,           89 291
Out[21= 2510
3.5       Square Roots Of Quaternions By Unit Vectors
 [4] says the following:
        You can write any quaternion in the form
        q = a+b*UNITVECTOR where a and b are real, and UNITVEC
        TOR is a unit vector. You probably know that as a quaternion a
        UNITVECTOR 2 = -1.          Therefore we can treat UNITVECTOR
        as if it were the usual imaginary unit i of the complex numbers.
        So we can use the usual techniques of finding square roots of
        complex numbers.
      Therefore we can use the Pythagorean method of finding a square root
to a Quaternion as soon as we have created a UNITVECTOR which is:
      b*i+c*j+d*k where the norm of the vector is 1, such that b2 +c 2 +d2          1
      In our following example we will have:
      (1/3) * i + (2/3) *j + (2/3) * k be the unit vector since (1/3)2 + (2/3)2 +
(2/3)2    = 9/9 = 1.
      Any Pythagorean Quadruple (a 2     + b2 + c 2 = d 2 ) divided by d will suffice.
Example
     1. 282 + 452 = 532
     2. a = 28, b = 45
     3. v28 +53 = 9 = ai
     4. /53 -28    = 5= b
                                          13

    5. 12 + 22 + 22 = 32 coefficients for the unit vector
  this is the square
remember to multiply a*2 and b*2 so it is 2*28=56 and 2*45=90
Quaternion[56, 90 1/3 , 90 2/3, 90 2/31=Quaternion[56, 30, 60, 601
this is the root
Quaternion[9, 5 1/3, 5 2/3, 5 2/31 ** Quaternion[9, 5 1/3, 5 2/3, 5 2/31
Quaternion[56, 30, 60, 601
     so, by this method, the square root of any Pythagorean Triple and a unit
vector can be taken quite easily.
4       Inventiveness Of Work
An Internet search shows that [5], available at: "https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/"
"lwanp7/relation-between-complex-numbers-andpythagorean/", has discov
ered how Pythagorean Triples can solve for Complex Square Roots, but the
source in question only mentions this for continuous numbers using the ac
tual i number. Another source[3] also has a similar idea that Pythagorean
Triples can help take Complex Square Roots.
     This Patent extends this work to modular arithmetic and to multi-imaginary
number systems such as Quaternions, Tessarines, Split Complex numbers,
and also modular Tessarines.
5       Utility of Work
It is not necessary to have rational modular numbers for the imaginaries, i,j,
k, for either quaternions or for tessarines. Quaternions are used to compute
rotations in computer graphics and for space craft movements. Quaternions
                                        14

and tessarines and split complex numbers have utility even if the instanti
ation of the imaginaries cannot be done, except for that of tessarines and
split complex numbers in modular arithmetic of p*q modula of 1 mod 4
semiprimes.
    Tessarines, and split complex numbers, are used for unit hyperbole cal
culations.
    Tessarines have also been applied in digital signal processing[7]. Split
Complex numbers are also used in calculations of Minkowski space[2], which
is used in calculations dealing with special relativity.
    Any procedure that needs to quickly take a square root of a 4 dimensional
object and wishes to keep the coefficients integers could use the procedures
outlined above.
    Math teachers, who are making examples of square roots for the above
math identities for their classwork and for the preparations of tests, would
very much like to use the Pythagorean Method of taking the square roots,
since it keeps the numbers to be integers, which are easier for students to
work out.
