                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0037] The present disclosure describes systems and methods for measuring properties of
water within a water distribution system at multiple locations throughout the water
distribution system. The present disclosure also describes sensors that may be installed in
the water distribution system for one or more clients (e.g., water utility companies). The
sensors may be configured to generate energy from the water itself to power its internal
circuitry. The sensors may be tapped into the side of a pipe or installed at any location in
the system.
[0038] The water property measurements may be logged in the sensors and periodically
uploaded to a server using a wireless communication network. Measurements may also be

                                                 6
uploaded on demand in some embodiments. The server, which may be a web server,
maintains the measurements in a database. Clients may access the measurements to view
the readings during various time periods. Also, the clients may request a substantially real
time measurement.
[0039] FIG. 1A is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a system 100 for managing
data related to properties of water in a water distribution system. As shown in this
implementation, the system 100 comprises a sensing device 102, a web application 104,
and a client system 106. It may be noted that, as illustrated, the system 100 includes a
single sensing device 102 and a single client system 106. However, it will be understood by
one of skill in the art that the system 100 may include any number of sensing devices 102
installed in various locations in the water distribution system. Also, the system 100 may
include any number of client systems 106 for any number of clients. The multiple client
systems 106 may be connected to the web application 104 through a communication
network. In this respect, multiple sensing devices 102 may be used to monitor water
properties at various locations within one or more water distribution systems for multiple
clients, and the clients can access their respective sensor readings through the web
application 104.
[0040] The sensing device 102 of the current embodiment comprises, among other things,
a sensor 110 (e.g., a pressure sensor), a battery 112, and an antenna 114. The sensing
device 102 may include any suitable type of sensor 110 for sensing various characteristics
of water within a water distribution system. For example, the sensor 110 may be a pressure
sensor for measuring water pressure at a particular location in the water distribution system,
a flow rate sensor for measuring the rate that water is flowing through the particular location
of the water distribution system, a chlorine sensor for measuring the chlorine content of the
water at the location, or other types of sensors.
[0041] The battery 112 may include any suitable type of battery or batteries for providing
power to the sensor 110 and other electronics of the sensing device 102. In some
embodiments, the sensing device 102 may include a power generation device that harvests
energy from the flow of water. The power generation device may be configured to recharge
the battery 112, supplement the power of the battery 112, or even replace the battery 112.
[0042] The antenna 114 is configured to wirelessly transmit properties of water that are
sensed by the sensing device 102 to the web application 104. The sensor data may be
transmitted over any suitable type of wireless network 116, such as, for example, a cellular
network, radio frequency (RF) channels, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. A receiver on the wireless

                                               7
network 116 is configured to convert the sensor data signals to allow transmission over a
data network 118 using any suitable protocol, such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http),
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet Protocol (IP), or other communication
protocol. The data network 118 may include a wide area network (WAN), such as the
Internet, and/or may include local area networks (LANs).
[0043] The web application 104 as shown in FIG. 1A may be configured on a server, such
as a web server, or a group of servers. The web application 104 may be associated with a
data management company that provides a service to its clients for managing the clients'
sensor data. For example, multiple clients (e.g., water distribution companies) may wish to
have the data management company monitor the sensor data and then make the data
available to the clients as desired. As explained in more detail below, the clients can
customize how the water properties for the pipes in their system are to be sensed. They
can also customize how the information about the sensor data can be accessed. They can
also customize how they will be contacted if the sensor data reveals a warning or critical
condition. In FIG. 1A, only one client system 106 is shown, but it should be understood that
multiple client systems 106 may be configured in the system 100 to access the server on
which the web application 104 is running.
[0044] FIG. 1B is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a system 150 for
measuring properties of water and managing the measurement data. According to the
embodiment shown in FIG. 1B, the system 150 includes a plurality of sensing devices 152
that are distributed throughout an area and are installed to be in contact with water within a
water distribution system. The sensing devices 152 are installed and put into service to
allow them to take measurements of the water at their particular location and wirelessly
communicate the measurement data to a cell tower 154 or other wireless communication
device for receiving wireless signals, such as a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth receiver. Also, multiple
cell towers 154 or receivers may be incorporated in the system 150.
[0045] The system 150 of FIG. 1B also includes a network 156, which enables
communication from a wireless communication protocol, or other communication channel
protocol, to a data network protocol. The network 156 enables the measurement data
received by the cell tower 154 to be transmitted to a server 160. The server 160 may be
one or more computer systems for managing the measurements of water properties. The
server 160 may be a web server for providing a web site for clients to access if authorized.
The system 150 also includes client devices 162, which may include desktop computers,
wired or wireless laptop devices, smart phones, or other computer system. The client

                                                8
devices 162 may include computer systems for any number of clients. Also, it should be
known that any number of client devices 162 may be used for each client.
[0046] FIG. 1C is a block diagram of an embodiment of the server 160 shown in FIG. 1B.
In this implementation, the server 160 comprises a processor 170, a memory 172, an
interface 174, and the database 122. In some embodiments, the database 122 may be
separate from the server 160. The processor 170 is configured to control the operations of
the server 160. The server 160 may execute certain functions that may be stored in
software and/or firmware and execute functions that may be configured in hardware. The
memory 172, in some embodiments, may comprise the web application 104 and the API
126. The interface 174, in some embodiments, may comprise the browser interface 124.
The interface 174 may be a network interface for interfacing with the client devices 162 via
the network 156.
[0047] The web application 104, according to the embodiment shown in FIG. 1A, may
comprise at least a web site 120, a database 122, a browser interface 124, and an
Application Programming Interface (API) 126. As shown in FIG. 1C, the web application
104, database 122, browser interface 124, and API 126 may be contained within the server
160. The web site 120 provides various web pages and screen views (as explained below)
to a user on the client system 106 or client devices 162. The database 122 is configured to
store the data retrieved from the sensing devices 102, 152. The database 122 may be
arranged to securely separate the data for one client from another. In some embodiments,
multiple databases 122 may be used. The browser interface 124 enables a user on the
client system 106 to access the web site 120 and obtain sensor data formatted in an
organized way, as described below. The API 126 provides an interface for the client system
106 to access the web application 104. The web application 104, with the web site 120,
browser interface 124, database 122, and API 126, may be configured in one package, such
as in a single server (e.g., server 160).
[0048] The web site 120 can take requests from authorized clients, search the database
122, and send information back to the clients. In some embodiments, the clients may wish
to request a certain reading at a certain time and date. The log in the database 122 that is
closest to that time and date can be retrieved from the database 122 and sent to the SCADA
system.
[0049] Furthermore, the web site 120 may be configured to include two different types of
retrieval techniques for the clients' use. The first technique is a simple Read, while the
second technique is referred to ReadX. With Read, the client may make requests for data,

                                                9
and in response the data log is retrieved and sent back to the client. In this case, the data is
merely read from the database 122 and remains in the database 122 without any change to
the data entry.
[0050] However, a ReadX command allows a client to request data. Again, the data is
retrieved and sent to the client. In this case, however, the web application 104 checks to
ensure that the client has indeed received the data. For example, the API 126 may request
for an acknowledgement from the client that the records were received successfully. When
the client system 106 receives the data successfully and stores this data in its own
database, it sends an acknowledgement (ACK) receipt back to the web application 104.
When the API 126 receives this ACK receipt signal, the web application 104 erases that
data from the database 122.
[0051] One benefit of the ReadX command, for example, is for security. Certain clients
may not want their data to be stored on another database that does not belong to them.
This may also be beneficial for the data management company that owns the server 160 or
web application 104, because the owner may be released from any liability associated with
the other party's information. In this respect, the client can be able to hide or manage their
proprietary data any way they see fit.
[0052] The client system 106 or client device 162 may include any suitable communication
device capable of transmitting and receiving http or other data transmissions. For example,
the client system 106 or client device 162 may be a personal computer, laptop computer,
tablet computer, or other computer systems. The client system 106 or client device 162
may also include portable electronic communication devices, such as cell phones, smart
phones, or other mobile devices that may utilize a cellular network, data network, or other
types of networks. The client system 106 or client device 162 may include its own database
for storing sensor data retrieved from the web application 104. The client system 106 or
client device 162 may be a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. The
client system 106 or client device 162 may also be configured to contain a user interface
that allows a user to see web pages of the web application 104, as described below with
respect to FIG. 11-18.
[0053] The system 100 may be a multi-tenant system for managing sensors for multiple
clients. The system 100 may be configured to show only the sensor devices for each
particular client when a client signs in. Thus, each client is only able to see their own
sensors and not the sensor of other clients. However, a master device may be connected in
the system 150 to allow a user to access information for all the sensors. The master device

                                                10
may be the server 160 that run the web application 104 or may be computer system
connected directly to the server 160. In some respects, the master device may be operated
by a city or county government for monitoring the water distribution systems in their
jurisdictions.
[0054] The system 100 gives clients an inexpensive product that can be employed
relatively easily on the part of the client. The system 100 allows a client (e.g., water utility
company) to sign up with a service that provides a combination of water monitoring
functions all in one package.
[0055] The server 160 associated with the web application 104 may be configured with a
system health monitoring module 180. The system health monitoring module 180 may be
configured in software, hardware, and/or firmware. The system health monitoring module
180 may be configured to evaluate the health of the water distribution system using an
empirical method of analyzing many data points. The system health monitoring module 180
may be neural network for determining whether values are within a normal range. In some
embodiments, the data points may be evaluated based on their location in the water
distribution system and based on the time of day when the measurements were taken. The
system health monitoring module 180 may use statistical analysis to determine if certain
points are abnormal or unhealthy with respect to baseline data points established for a
normal or healthy system.
[0056] In some embodiments, the system health monitoring module 180 may use the
Mahalanobis-Taguchi System (MTS) for determining the health of the system. The MTS, for
example, uses pattern recognition to analyze multi-variate data. The system health
monitoring module 180 can analyze values with respect to norms based on the MTS model.
Not only does the MTS model diagnose the norms, but it can also include a predictive
method for analyzing patterns in multivariate cases.
[0057] The system health monitoring module 180 may analyze both location-dependent
and time-dependent data. For example, a water flow rate at 4:00 pm at a certain location in
the water distribution system may have a certain normal range based on multiple
measurements taken at this time. When values are outside of this range, the system health
monitoring module 180 can instruct the interface 174 to provide an alert to the client. In
some embodiments, the system health monitoring module 180 may process data stored in
the database 122 from multiple sensors and consider all the parameters when diagnosing
health.

                                                11
[0058] The server 160 is also configured to read data in real time, perform hydraulic
simulation in real-time, and recommend a pump power level in real-time. The server 160
may also read data, perform hydraulic simulation, and control the pump power level. The
server 160 may also be configured to detect leaks in the main when the pressure matrix is
abnormal.
[0059]    FIG. 2 is a cutaway side view of a water sensing assembly 200, according to
various embodiments of the present disclosure. The water sensing assembly includes a
housing 210 enclosing a battery pack 220, a generator 230, a pressure sensor 240, and
measurement and communication electronics 250. An antenna 260 is mounted to the
exterior of the housing 210. Extending from a lower end of the housing 210 is a turbine 270.
The turbine 270 is a vertical axis turbine in the current embodiment, and is coupled to the
generator 230 by a turbine shaft 275 extending through a sealed shaft bore 277 and a seal
partition 279 to connect with a generator shaft 235 of the generator 230. In various
embodiments, the turbine 270 is may be indirectly coupled to the generator, such as with
magnets, so that the turbine 270 may be fully separated from a sealed interior of the
housing 21.
[0060]    The pressure sensor 240 is mounted within the housing 210 such that the pressure
sensor 240 extends through the seal partition 275 to partially expose pressure sensor 240 to
fluid flow along the lower end of the housing 210, which may travel around turbine 270 into
the lower interior of housing 210. The pressure sensor 240 communicates fluid pressure
readings to measurement and communications electronics 250, which may process, store,
and/or communicate the date through antenna connection 260. The measurement and
communications electronics 250, pressure sensor 240, and antenna 260 are powered by
battery pack 220, which is recharged by generator 230.
[0061]    In operation, the water sensing assembly 200 is a self-contained, removable
sensing unit that may be tapped into a fluid pipe or other valve through a tap or bore. The
turbine 270 is situated such that the turbine 270 is within the fluid path of the fluid passing
through the fluid pipe. The fluid flow thereby turns the turbine 270, turning the generator
shaft 235, causing the generator 230 to generate a current to recharge batter pack 220. The
presence of the turbine 270 and generator 230 attached to the battery pack 220 allows the
battery pack 220 to last longer, giving the water sensing assembly 200 a longer life to detect
sensing data. The pressure sensor 240 may be replaced by various other sensors in various
embodiments, such as chlorine or flow sensors.

[0062] FIG. 3A is detail view of the shape of a vertical axis turbine 370. As seen in FIG.
3A, the vertical axis turbine 370 includes two wings 372a,b, each wing having a curved
profile and extending in opposite spirals on either side of a central turbine axis 374. When
fluid flows in against vertical axis turbine 370 in a direction 376 orthogonal to the central
turbine axis 374, fluid pushes wings 372a,b such that the vertical axis turbine 370 spins
about central turbine axis 374.
[0063] FIG. 3B is a perspective view of a second water sensing assembly 300, according
to various embodiments of the present disclosure. The water sensing assembly 300 includes
a housing 310, a mounting bracket 320, mounting bracket fasteners 325, power wires 330,
and a turbine 340. As seen in FIG. 3B, the housing 310 is coupled to the mounting bracket
320, and power wires 330 extend through a wiring bore 322 defined in the mounting bracket
320 into housing 310.
[0064] FIG. 3C is another cutaway side view of the second water sensing assembly 300 of
FIG. 3B, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. As seen in FIG. 3C, a
generator 350 is mounted within the housing 310 similarly to generator 230. The turbine 340
extends from a lower end of the housing 310 similarly to turbine 270. The turbine 340 is a
vertical axis turbine in the current embodiment, and is coupled to the generator 340 by a
turbine shaft 345 extending through a sealed shaft bore 347 and a seal partition 349 to
connect with a generator shaft 355 of the generator 350. A side bore 380 is defined in the
housing 310 below seal partition 349 so that fluid may flow around turbine 340 to side bore
380. In various embodiments, the turbine 340 is may be indirectly coupled to the generator,
such as with magnets, so that the turbine 340 may be fully separated from a sealed interior
of the housing 310. In the current embodiment, the power wires 330 may be directly
connected to the generator to power sensing, communication, process, data storage, and
other electronic equipment. Further, a pressure sensor or other sensor may be mounted
within the housing 310 similarly to pressure sensor 240 within housing 210. The mounting
bracket 320 may mount the water sensing assembly 300 on any sort of sensing, tapping, or
boring equipment.
[0065] FIG. 4 is a diagram of the water sensing assembly 400 of FIG. 2 installed on a pipe,
with various partial cross-sectional views of parts of the water sensing assembly 400 and
the surrounding environment, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.
The water sensing assembly 400 is buried underground in the current embodiment such that
it extends from a pipe 410 to a ground surface 420, such as a road.

                                              13
[0066] FIG. 5 is front cross-sectional view of the water sensing assembly 400 of FIG. 4,
according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. As seen in FIG. 5, the water
sensing assembly 400 includes a valve box 1 mounted over pipe 4. A saddle 15 connects
ball valve 6 to the pipe 4, and a reducer 5 couples a pressure sensor 7 to the ball valve 6.
Wiring 11 runs up through the valve box 1 to a communication assembly 17. The
communication assembly 17 may contain processing, data storage, and power equipment in
various embodiments to store, communicate, and receive orders based on data received
from the pressure sensor 7. To communicate data and receive orders, the communication
assembly 17 is connected by a wire 14 to an antenna 2 mounted on an iron cap 18, the iron
cap 18 itself mounted on an adjustable top 3. The adjustable top 3 connects to the valve box
1, forming an enclosure extending from ground surface 420 to the top of pipe 410 to protect
the enclosed equipment. The adjustable top 3 can be adjusted telescopically to vary the
overall height of the water sensing assembly 400, based on the depth of the pipe below
ground level. Other sensors may be used with water sensing assembly, such as chlorine or
flow sensors.
[0067] FIG. 6 is a partially cutaway side view of the water sensing assembly 400 of FIG. 4,
according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. As seen in FIG. 6, the
communication assembly 17 is mounted to the iron cap 18 by a hanging bracket 16. The
communication assembly 17 is configured to receive measurement signals from the        __  and
transmit the signals from antenna 2 of the sensor assembly. The signals are transmitted to
the web application 104 via the cellular network 116 or 154. The antenna 2 may be
configured for Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication using a cellular network,
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) communication, or can be used with other types of
communication networks and protocols. In some embodiments, the communication device
17 may include a plug-in for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other short range communication.
[0068] FIG. 7 is an exploded view of the water sensing assembly 400 of FIG. 4, according
to various embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in FIG. 7, the water assembly
400 includes two flat washers 8, lock washer 9, two hex nuts 10, hanging bracket 16,
machine screw 12, and jam nut 13, the combination of which mounts communication
assembly 17 to iron cap 18.
[0069] FIG. 8 is a cutaway side view of a water sensing assembly 300 mounted in a multi
port service saddle 800 on a pipe 810, according to various embodiments of the present
disclosure. As shown in FIG. 8, the multi-port service saddle 800 includes a main port 820
and a secondary port 830. A ball valve 840 is mounted in main port 820 and a ball valve 850

                                               14
is mounted in secondary port 830. Ball valve 840 includes a ball bore 842 and ball valve 850
includes a ball bore 852, each of which may be turned to open and close main port 820 and
secondary port 830, respectively. In FIG. 8, the ball valve 840 is closed and the ball valve
850 is open. A lower end 860 of the multi-port service saddle 800 defines a lower opening
862, which is aligned with a bore 812 in the pipe 810.
[0070] To form bore 812 in the pipe 810 without leakage from the pipe, the multi-port
service saddle 800 is mounted to the pipe exterior with the ball valve 840 open and the ball
valve 850 closed. A tapping machine is mounted to main port 820 and is pushed down
through main port 820 to form bore 812. The tapping machine is then pulled out of ball valve
840 into a pre-insertion position and ball valve 840 is closed. Water sensing assembly 300
may then be mounted to multi-port service saddle as shown in FIG. 8.
[0071] As shown in FIG. 8, water sensing assembly 300 is mounted to a port bracket 890
coupled to main port 820. Insertion screws 870 extend between mounting bracket 320 and
port bracket 890, with turbine 340 and housing 310 pre-inserted into main port 820. A
sensor cap 880 is shown coupled to secondary port 830 and including a sensor 882. Sensor
882 can be any sensor for fluid data collection, such as a pressure sensor, chlorine sensor,
or flow sensor. While the water sensing assembly 300 is mounted outside ball valve 840,
fluid may flow into multi-port service saddle 800 to secondary port 830 where the fluid may
be sensed by sensor 882.
[0072] FIG. 9 is a cutaway side view of the second water sensing assembly 300 in a power
generation mode, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. To place
water sensing assembly 300 in power generation mode, ball valve 840 is opened and
insertion screws 870 are tightened to pull mounting bracket 320 towards port bracket 890.
Once mounting bracket 320 and port bracket 890 are flush together, as shown in FIG. 9,
mounting bracket fasteners 325 fasten mounting bracket 320 to port bracket 890. However,
in various embodiments, water sensing assembly 300 may be inserted to various degrees
within main port 820 such that turbine 340 may be partially presented at varying depths to
fluid flow within pipe 810, which may lessen the speed at which turbine 340 turns,
generating less power and allowing for a customizable level of power generation based on
known fluid flow and power needs. Moving mounting bracket 320 towards port bracket 890
inserts housing 310 and turbine 340 into main port 820 such that turbine 340 extends down
through lower opening 862 bore 812 into fluid flow within pipe 810, thereby turning turbine
340 and generating current to power various equipment or recharge batteries. In this
configuration, fluid flow may pass up through side bore 380 so that sensor 882 may continue

                                                15
to sense fluid conditions within pipe 810. Turbine 340 may be removed from the fluid path
within pipe 810 by use of insertion screws 870 to move mounting bracket 320 away from
port bracket 890. This may be necessary if, for instance, a pig is sent down the pipe 810 to
clean the system and it is desired to prevent damage to turbine 340.
[0073] FIG. 10 is a chart showing an exemplary sampling rate, log rate, and upload rate
related to sensing water properties. The sensing assembly may be configured to remain in
a sleep mode until it is configured to wake up and take a sample reading. For example, the
sampling rate may include sampling once every 15 seconds. The log rate may be set, for
example, at about once every 15 minutes. During the log interval (e.g., 15 minutes), the
processing device of the sensor assembly may be configured to store only the samples that
are the highest value and the lowest value. Measurements in between the high value and
low value during that log interval may be discarded. When a new high or new low value is
sampled, it replaces the old value. In this sense, only two values are stored during each log
interval. At the end of the log interval, the processing device stores the high and low value
for that interval in memory. Therefore, at the log rate (e.g., once every 15 minutes), two
values are stored or logged. The sensor assembly repeats the logging at the log rate until it
is time for uploading as determined by the upload rate. In one example, the upload rate
may be about once per day. This is the rate at which the sensor assembly uploads the log
information via the antenna 114 to the server 160.
[0074] One benefit of these three rates is that the sensor data does not consume much
memory within the sensor assembly, only the high and low values for each log interval.
Also, the upload rate may be set to upload not very often (e.g., once a day), which can
conserve battery life versus uploading after every reading. Thus, the sensor and
communication device 17 may be in a sleep mode and then wake up only to sense and
upload data. For example, with these rate settings, a battery may last about seven years or
longer.
[0075] In some embodiments, the sampling rate and log rate may be set to the same rate.
A client may request such a set-up if they wish to view the data in more detail and have
access to the data at any time. The cellular modem may be placed in a low-power mode
and listen for a signal, such as an SMS message from the client. In this way, the client can
get a substantially real-time measurement. When requested in this manner, the sensor
assembly is waken up, regardless of the sampling rate times, and takes a reading. The
communication device sends the newly taken reading, or, in some embodiments, may send
the high and low readings of a current logging interval, to the web application 104. The web

                                                16
site 120 can then communicate that data directly to the client, via e-mail, SMS, or other
communication channel. Of course, this strategy may increase the battery usage compared
with normal operations. This may cut the battery life to about two years.
[0076] The client may be given options to choose between different types of plans for
receiving sensor data. For example, the client may wish to have access to data under
normal operations, with the uploaded data being available the following day. The second
option may be the substantially real-time plan.
[0077] Another feature of the sensor assembly is that when sample data is measured, the
processing device may analyze the data to see if it falls within a normal range of values. If
so, then nothing needs to be done, except store the values if they are highs or lows for the
period. Otherwise, if the values are not within normal range, the communication device
sends an alert to the web site 120. In this case, the modem is waken from sleep mode and
instructed to transmit the details of the out-of-range measurement. In response to receiving
this alert, the web site 120 may be configured to check the reading with the client's settings
to find out what type of notification they wish to receive when such a condition occurs. The
web site 120 may then send an SMS message, e-mail, or other type of message to inform
the client of the condition.
[0078] FIGS. 11-18 show examples of various screen views of web pages that may be
displayed on a user interface, such as the user interface of the client system 106. The web
pages may be part of the web site 120 shown in FIG. 1 that allows a client to access the
data stored in the database 122. The web pages are designed to provide an organized and
easy to understand display for the users.
[0079] FIG. 11 is an example of a screen view of a web page that may be displayed on a
user interface 1100 for enabling a user to sign up to receive a service for viewing water
property data. Initially, a new user signs up or registers with the web server. After the user
is registered, he or she can sign in to the server and obtain the relevant data. For example,
the web server may include the one or more web servers that are configured to run the web
application 104 shown in FIG. 1. In this respect, the user interface 1100 may be displayed
on a screen, display, monitor, or other visual indication device of the client system 106. The
user interface 1100 allows a user to sign up using an e-mail address, password, first name,
last name, and mobile phone number.
[0080] Also, the sign up user interface 1100 includes an entry window for a "service
contract number." The service contract number is a number that is set up for a particular
client that has a service contract with the company that manages the web application 104

                                                 17
shown in FIG. 1. A client may allow its associates or employees to also sign up to gain
access under the respective service contract number.
[0081] The user interface 1100 also includes entry windows for time zone, street address,
city, state, and zip code. This can be the information for the location of the client (e.g.,
water distribution company).
[0082] In addition, the user interface 1100 includes four selectable boxes that allow the
new user to set up the types of ways that the user may be contacted if a warning condition
or critical condition occurs. For example, the user may choose to receive a text message
(e.g., a Short Message Service (SMS)) message or other type of electronic message on a
portable electronic device. The user may also choose to receive an e-mail message for
warning or critical conditions. For example, a warning condition may be a condition that if
untreated may lead to problems with the water distribution system, while a critical condition
may be a condition that indicates a more severe problem, such as pipe that has burst.
[0083] One method for initiating a new contract according to one implementation may
include the following. The data managing company provides a service contract number to a
new client. They also send the client a URL and instructions on how to set up an account.
The URL and instructions are contained in an e-mail that is sent to the client. A contact
person (e.g., a boss) at the client's company may set up a profile for himself or herself. He
or she may also send the URL and instructions to other in the company so that they too can
set up a profile. The additional profiles will include the personal information for the other
people (e.g., employees) and will also include the same service contract number for that
company. Each individual in the company can therefore choose the types of notifications
they receive when a warning condition or critical condition is sensed.
[0084] FIG. 12 is an example of a screen view of a web page that may be displayed on a
user interface 1200 showing a map of sensing device locations. The map may be any
suitable map of an area where a client's sensing devices are installed. Sensors may be
installed in any part of the water distribution system, such as on main pipes, secondary
pipes, neighborhood pipes, residential pipes, etc. For example, the map may be provided
by Google Maps or other online mapping service.
[0085] Superimposed on this map are icons 1202, which are configured to display the
locations of the sensor devices 102. As shown in this figure, five icons are displayed,
representing five different sensor devices 102. It should be understood that the map may
show any number of icons 1202, depending on how many sensor devices are installed and
placed in service. The icons 1202 can each include a number for distinguishing one sensor

                                                18
from another. If a user selects one of the icons, such as by hovering a mouse icon over an
icon 1202, clicking an icon 1202, tapping an icon 1202 on a touch-sensitive screen, or by
other entry methods, the web site 120 may be configured to bring up a new page, such as
the page described with respect to FIG. 13.
[0086] The icons 1202 can be displayed in different ways to indicate various conditions of
the sensor. For example, if the sensor senses a warning condition, the icon 1202 may be
displayed in a different way from a normal condition. In one embodiment, the icons 1202
may be green if they measurements are within a normal range, but may be changed to
yellow or red if the measurements indicate a warning or critical condition. Other than
changing color to indicate condition, the icons 1202 can also be displayed in other ways,
such as by changing the size or shape of the icon 1202, or by flashing the icon 1202, or
other means of distinguishing an abnormal condition from a normal one.
[0087] The user interface 1200 may be configured to show different types of sensors. For
example, if a client has any combination of pressure sensors, flow rate sensors, chlorine
sensors, etc., each type of sensor may be displayed differently. As an example, the
different types may be distinguished by using different colors (e.g., blue, green, black, etc.)
for the icons. The different sensors may also be shown with icons of different shapes (e.g.,
circle, square, triangle, etc.).
[0088] FIG. 13 is an example of a screen view of a web page that may be displayed on a
user interface 1300 showing a map of sensing locations with information about a sensing
device superimposed. In this example, the information for the selected sensor is displayed
in a box 1302, representing a device condition window. The information may include a
current reading for that sensor. With respect to implementations in which the sensing
device is a pressure sensor, the reading may give a value in units of pounds per square inch
(psi). The illustrated example shows a current pressure of 40.0 psi. If the sensor is
configured to measure chlorine content, for instance, the box 1302 may display "Chlorine
Content" with the reading.
[0089] If the reading (e.g., pressure) is out of a normal range, then the numbers may be
highlighted in a particular way to draw attention to it. For example, the number may appear
in yellow if the reading is within a warning level and may appear in red if it is within a critical
condition. Also, green may be a color used to indicate that the reading is normal.
[0090] The box 1302 may also include a phone number of the device 102, which may be
the cellular number used to communicate the data to the cellular network 116. The box
1302 may also include an address of the device 102.

                                                  19
[0091] The superimposed box 1302 may also include a first link to "Device" and a second
link to "Measurements." The first link allows a user to navigate to another web page, such
as the web page described with respect to FIG. 14. The second link allows the user to
navigate to yet another web page, such as the web page described with respect to FIG. 16.
[0092] FIG. 14 is an example of a screen view of a web page that may be displayed on a
user interface 1400 showing further details of a sensing device. For example, this web page
may be displayed when the user selects the "Devices" link shown in FIG. 13 or when the
user navigates to the page by some other route. The user interface 1400 shows more
details of the particular sensing device highlighted at an earlier time. The device information
may include the phone number, a description of its location, latitude and longitude
information, high warning level, critical high level, low warning level, and critical low level.
The information may also include a reading of a particular property (e.g., pressure). The
measurement value (e.g., pressure) may be highlighted in any suitable way if the value is
outside of the range indicated by the high and low warning levels or outside the range
indicated by the high and low critical condition levels.
[0093] The high warning level, critically high level, low warning level, and critically low level
may be set by the client, having an understanding of the nature of the various pipes
throughout the water distribution system. For example, a high warning level of 110.0 psi is a
level that the client knows may be an indication of a problem that should likely be
investigated. A critically high level of 150.0 psi is likely an indication that a pipe is about to
burst. A low warning level of 40.0 psi may indicate a small leak in the pipe, and a critically
low level of 30.0 psi may indicate a larger leak that likely needs to be attended to
immediately. Also, when a critically low level occurs in a pressure reading, the client may
need to notify its customers of a "boil" notice that water may be engraphed with
contaminates.
[0094] A "status" output may also be displayed. If status is normal, the output may be
blank, but if the status is a warning or critical, the status indication may be changed to show
such conditions. For example, the status may change to a different color, may blink, or may
include some other type of highlighting feature. In one embodiment, for a warning, the
status output may be displayed yellow, and for a critical condition, the status output may be
displayed red.
[0095] FIG. 15 is an example of a screen view of a web page that may be displayed on a
user interface 1500 for enabling a user to edit parameters of a sensing device. In this web
page, the user can change the description, which may include location information of the

                                               20
device. The user can also change the latitude and longitude information, and the high and
low warning and critical condition levels. When finished editing, the user can click on the
"update device" button. In some embodiments, the phone number box may not be available
to the client but may only be available for users of the management company.
[0096] FIG. 16 is an example of a screen view of a web page that may be displayed on a
user interface 1600 showing a graph and data points representing measurements by a
sensing device. This web page shows measurement data from one sensor over certain time
periods. The user may select time periods of 1 day, 2 days, 5 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1
month, 6 months, 1 year, or all. The graph section of the web page shows the high and low
points for each day. The data point section shows the reading (e.g., pressure), notes (if
any), and the time when the measurement was taken. This web page also gives the user an
option to edit or annotate a particular record by pressing the "edit" button on the same line
as the record.
[0097] The data points in the graph and in the table may be highlighted in any suitable way
to indicate when a measurement is outside a range of normal limits. For example, the date
points or measurement readings may be given a different color, size, shape, or other
distinctive feature to indicate abnormal conditions.
[0098] FIG. 17 is an example of a screen view of a web page that may be displayed on a
user interface 1700 for enabling a user to edit measurements. For example, if the user of
the user interface 1600 of FIG. 16 presses the "edit" button, the web site 120 navigates the
user to the user interface 1700. In this page, the user can enter a note that is saved with
the particular data record. In this example, the user wishes to annotate a low pressure
reading that occurred when the client was aware that a pipe was broken. In this case, the
user enters a message, such as "Main Pipe was broken." To enter the new note into the
database 122, the user selects the "update measurement" button. In some embodiments,
the "destroy" button may not be available or may be available to a limited extent. The
purpose of the destroy button is to remove the particular sensor from the system and/or
ignore any readings or communications from the sensor.
[0099] FIG. 18 is an example of a screen view of a web page that may be displayed on a
user interface 1800 for enabling a user to edit user information. The user interface 1800 in
this example is similar to the user sign-up page shown in FIG. 11. A user can access this
page using the "Edit Profile" link on any of the user interfaces shown in FIGS. 12-18. The
user can edit any information, such as e-mail, address, password, or other personal
information. The user can also edit the ways that the user will receive warnings from the

                                                 21
system 100. For example, if the user decides that he or she wants to receive both an SMS
message and an e-mail when there is a critical condition, the user can check the appropriate
boxes.
[0100] The server 160 may be part of the utility company (e.g., water utility company) and
provide communication with other users via the communication network. In some
embodiments, the server may be part of a company responsible for managing the utility
measurement data. The communication network in these embodiments may be a local area
network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), such as the Internet, or any other suitable data
communication networks. The communication network may also include other types of
networks, such as plain old telephone service (POTS), cellular systems, satellite systems,
etc.
[0101] The server 160 may detect extreme events and provide an alarm in response. The
alarm may be in the form of an automated e-mail, a pop-up window, an interrupt signal or
indication on a computer of the client device 162, SMS, or other suitable message signifying
an urgent event.
[0102] The client system 106 may include a computer system used by the utility provider.
In this respect, the utility provider system may be a client of the data management company
that manages the utility measurement data and/or provides monitoring services regarding
the status of the utility infrastructure. The client system, therefore, may be able to receive
and review status updates regarding the infrastructure. Alarms may be provided to the
client system, which may then be acknowledged and confirmed. The client system may also
receive historic data and manage the client's accounts and usage information. In some
embodiments, information may be provided to the client system in a read-only manner.
[0103] The sensing devices 152 and client devices 162 may communicate with the server
160 by a cellular service, via cellular towers and/or satellites. The wireless communication
between the devices may be active during some periods of time (when two respective
devices are linked) and may be inactive during other periods of time (when the devices are
not linked and/or are in sleep mode). Alternatively, any of the sensing devices 152 may be
connected to the network 156 through wired connections.
[0104] The water mains may include transmission mains, which may include water pipes
having an inside diameter of at least twelve inches. The water mains also include
distribution mains, which may include smaller pipes having an inside diameter of less than
twelve inches. The transmission mains, having a greater size, may be configured to allow a
greater amount of water flow in comparison with the distribution mains. The transmission

                                                  22
mains may be located nearer to the utility source and the distribution mains may be located
farther from the utility provider. In some systems, distribution mains may be located along
secondary roads or residential roads.
[0105] The cellular network 116 may include relay devices (e.g., using ISM frequency
transmission) for relaying radio signals from the cell towers 154 to the data network 156.
The network 156 in some embodiments may also include the cellular network 116, a satellite
network, a radio network, a LAN, a WAN, or any other suitable network.
[0106] In some embodiments, the sensing devices 152 may comprise printed circuit board
with the components of a sensor interface, processing device, and communication device
incorporated on the printed circuit board. In other embodiments, multiple printed circuit
boards may be used with the components of the sensor interface, processing device, and
communication device incorporated on the boards in any suitable configuration. When the
electrical components are disposed on multiple boards, standoffs may be used as needed.
Connectors may be used to couple the processing device with the sensor interface and
communication device.
[0107] The sensor assembly may include any combination of sensors for detecting various
parameters that may be analyzed. For example, the sensor assembly may include one or
more piezoelectric sensors, acoustic sensors, acoustic transducers, hydrophones, pressure
sensors, pressure transducers, temperature sensors, accelerometers, flow sensors, chlorine
sensors, leak detectors, vibration sensors, or other types of sensors.
[0108] The power supply of the sensor assembly may contain one or more batteries, solar
powered devices, electrical power line couplers, or other power sources. When external
power is received, additional connectors or ports may be added through the walls of the
enclosure. When batteries are used, the power supply may also include a battery capacity
detection module for detecting the capacity of the one or more batteries. In some
embodiments, the power may be partially or completely supplied by the energy harvesting
device housed on the sensor assembly itself.
[0109] A sensor interface may be incorporated in the sensor assembly. The sensor
interface may be configured to acquire the acoustic, pressure, and/or temperature data from
the sensor assembly. In addition, the sensor interface may include amplification circuitry for
amplifying the sensed signals. The sensor interface may also include summing devices, low
pass filters, high pass filters, and other circuitry for preparing the signals for the processing
device. The sensor assembly may also include a processing device configured to log the

                                               23
measurement information and save it in memory until a designated upload time or when
requested by a client.
[0110] The communication device of the sensor assembly may include a modem, such as
a cellular or ISM-enabled modem to provide network access to the communication device.
Also, the communication device may include a tuning module, such as a GPS timing
receiver, for providing an accurate timing reference and for synchronizing timing signals with
other elements of the cellular network 116. The communication device may be configured
to transmit and receive RF signals (e.g., ISM frequency signals), cellular signals, GPS
signals, etc., via the antenna 114.
[0111] The processing device housed in the sensor assembly may include a processor, a
sensor data handling device, a power assembly, a communication module, a time/sleep
module, a data processing module, a health status detecting module, and a storage module.
The processor may comprise one or more of a microcontroller unit (MCU), a digital signal
processor (DSP), and other processing elements.
[0112] The sensor data handling device connects with the sensor interface and handles
the sensor data to allow processing of the signals by the processor. The power assembly
may comprise a power source, which may be separate from the power supply. In some
embodiments, however, the power assembly may be connected to the power supply. The
power assembly may also be configured to control the voltage and current levels to provide
constant power to the processor. In some embodiments, the processor may be provided
with about 3.3 volts DC. The communication module connects with the communication
device and receives and/or sends signals for communication through the communication
device. In some embodiments, the communication device may include a GPS device for
receiving timing samples for synchronization purposes. The timing samples may be
forwarded to the communication module to allow the processing device to be synchronized
with other devices. The timing samples may also be used to wake up the processing device
when needed or sleep when inactive.
[0113] The processing device also includes a time/sleep module for providing timing
signals to the processor and may include a crystal oscillator. The time/sleep module also
controls sleep modes in order to minimize battery usage when the sensor assembly is not in
use. For example, the processor may include an MCU that operates continually and a DSP
that sleeps when not in use. Since the DSP normally uses more power, it is allowed to
sleep in order to conserve battery power.

                                               24
[0114] The time/sleep module may be configured to wake various components of the
processor at designated times in order that sensor data stored during a previous time may
be transmitted to the host. In some embodiments, the time/sleep module may wake the
sensor assembly at a certain time during the day, enable the sensor assembly to analyze
and record the measurements, return to a sleep mode according to the sampling rate, and
repeat the analysis every 15 seconds or so for about 15 minutes. At the end of log period,
the communication device sends the data to the server 160 and the time/sleep module
returns the device to a sleep mode until the next designated time. Separate from the
regular sensing schedule, the time/sleep module may be configured to wake up the
processor in the event that a warning or critical condition has been detected.
[0115] The storage module of the sensor assembly may include flash memory, read-only
memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), or other types of memory.
[0116] Pressure sensors may be used in particular to measure an absolute pressure value.
Also, pressure sensors may be used as a burst sensor. In this respect, the sensor may
measure a high-speed pressure transient profile. Both the pressure change value and
absolute pressure value may be useful for different applications. The sensor(s) may
measure voltage signals or frequency measurements. Temperature sensors may also be
used for measuring the temperature of the pipe. The sensed waveform signals are supplied
to the processing device, which may process the signals at the point of measurement. In
other embodiments, the signals may be transmitted to the host for processing.
[0117] It should be noted that the functions of the sensor assembly may be configured in
software or firmware and the functions performed by the processor. The processor, as
mentioned above, may include a DSP, microcontroller, or other types of processing units. In
some embodiments, the signals may be communicated to the server 160 where processing
may occur. The real time processing may be performed by a DSP, for example.
[0118] One should note that conditional language, such as, among others, "can," "could,"
"might," or "may," unless specifically stated otherwise, or otherwise understood within the
context as used, is generally intended to convey that certain embodiments include, while
other embodiments do not include, certain features, elements and/or steps. Thus, such
conditional language is not generally intended to imply that features, elements and/or steps
are in any way required for one or more particular embodiments or that one or more
particular embodiments necessarily include logic for deciding, with or without user input or
prompting, whether these features, elements and/or steps are included or are to be
performed in any particular embodiment.
