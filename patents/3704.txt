Field
         Provided herein are methods, compounds, and compositions for reducing expression of
DMPK mRNA and protein in an animal. Also, provided herein are methods, compounds, and
compositions comprising a DMPK inhibitor for preferentially reducing CUGexp DMPK RNA,
reducing myotonia, or reducing spliceopathy in an animal. Such methods, compounds, and
compositions are useful, for example, to treat, prevent, or ameliorate type 1 myotonic dystrophy
(DM1) in an animal.
Background
          Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in
adults with an estimated frequency of 1 in 7,500 (Harper PS., Myotonic Dystrophy. London: W.B.
Saunders Company; 2001). DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by expansion of a non
coding CTG repeat in DMPK1. DMPK1 is a gene encoding a cytosolic serine/threonine kinase
(Brook JD, et al., Cell., 1992, 68(4):799-808). The physiologic functions and substrates of this
kinase have not been fully determined. The expanded CTG repeat is located in the 3' untranslated
region (UTR) of DMPK1. This mutation leads to RNA dominance, a process in which expression
of RNA containing an expanded CUG repeat (CUGexp) induces cell dysfunction (Osborne RJ and
Thornton CA., Human Molecular Genetics., 2006, 15(2): R162-R169).
          The DMPK gene normally has 5-37 CTG repeats in the 3' untranslated region. In
myotonic dystrophy type I, this number is significantly expanded and is, for example, in the range of
50 to greater than 3,500 (Harper, Myotonic Dystrophy (Saunders, London, ed.3, 2001); Annu. Rev.
Neurosci. 29: 259, 2006; EMiBO J. 19: 4439, 2000; Curr Opin Neurol. 20: 572, 2007).
                                                     1

       WO 2012/012443                                                           PCT/US2011/044555
            The CUGexp tract interacts with RNA binding proteins including muscleblind-like
  (MBNL) protein, a splicing factor, and causes the mutant transcript to be retained in nuclear foci.
  The toxicity of this RNA stems from sequestration of RNA binding proteins and activation of
  signaling pathways. Studies in animal models have shown that phenotypes of DM1 can be reversed
  if toxicity of CUGexp RNA is reduced (Wheeler TM, et al., Science., 2009, 325(5938):336-339;
  Mulders SA, et al., ProcNatlAcadSci USA., 2009, 106(33):13915-13920).
            In DM1, skeletal muscle is the most severely affected tissue, but the disease also has
  important effects on cardiac and smooth muscle, ocular lens, and brain. The cranial, distal limb, and
  diaphragm muscles are preferentially affected. Manual dexterity is compromised early, which
  causes several decades of severe disability. The median age at death is 55 years, usually from
  respiratory failure (de Die-Smulders CE, et al., Brain., 1998, 121(Pt 8):1557-1563).
            Antisense technology is emerging as an effective means for modulating expression of
  certain gene products and may therefore prove to be uniquely useful in a number of therapeutic,
  diagnostic, and research applications for the modulation of DMPKl. Intramuscular injection of
  fully modified oligonucleotides targeting with the CAG-repeat were shown in mice to block
  formation of CUGexp-MBNL1 complexes, disperse nuclear foci of CUGexp transcripts, enhance
  the nucleocytoplasmic transport and translation of CUGexp transcripts, release MBNL proteins to
  the nucleoplasm, normalize alternative splicing of MBNL-dependent exons, and eliminate myotonia
  in CUGexp-expressing transgenic mice (Wheeler TM, et al., Science., 2009, 325(5938):336-339;
  W02008/036406).
            Presently there is no treatment that can modify the course of DM1. The burden of disease,
  therefore, is significant. It is, therefore, an object herein to provide compounds, compositions, and
  methods for treating DM1
  Summary
5          Provided herein are methods, compounds, and compositions for inhibiting expression of
  DMPK and treating, preventing, delaying or ameliorating a DMPK related disease and or a
  symptom thereof. In certain embodiments, the compounds and compositions inhibit mutant DMPK
  or CUGexp DMPK.
           Certain embodiments provide a method of reducing DMPK expression in an animal
0 comprising administering to the animal a compound comprising a modified oligonucleotide as
  further described herein targeted to DMPK.

        WO 2012/012443                                                         PCT/US2011/044555
           Certain embodiments provide a method of preferentially reducing CUGexp DMPK, reducing
   myotonia, or reducing spliceopathy in an animal comprising administering to the animal a
   compound comprising a modified oligonucleotide, as further described herein, targeted to CUGexp
   DMPK. CUGexp DMPK transcripts are believed to be particularly sensitive to antisense
   knockdown via nuclear ribonucleases, because of their longer residence time in the nucleus, and this
   sensitivity is thought to permit effective antisense inhibition of CUGexp DMPK transcripts in
  relevant tissues such as muscle despite the biodistribution barriers to tissue uptake of antisense
   oligonucleotides. Antisense mechanisms that do not elicit cleavage via nuclear ribonucleases, such
   as the CAG-repeat ASOs described in, for example, Wheeler TM, et al., Science., 2009,
   325(5938):336-339 and WO2008/036406, do not provide the same therapeutic advantage.
           Certain embodiments provide a method of treating an animal with type 1 myotonic
  dystrophy. In certain embodiments, the method includes administering to the animal a
  therapeutically effective amount of a compound comprising a modified oligonucleotide as further
  described herein targeted to DMPK. In certain embodiments, the method includes identifying an
  animal with type 1 myotonic dystrophy.
           Certain embodiments provide a method of treating, preventing, delaying, or ameliorating
  symptoms and outcomes associated with development of DM1 including muscle stiffness, myotonia,
  disabling distal weakness, weakness in face and jaw muscles, difficulty in swallowing, drooping of
  the eyelids ptosiss), weakness of neck muscles, weakness in arm and leg muscles, persistent muscle
  pain, hypersomnia, muscle wasting, dysphagia, respiratory insufficiency, irregular heartbeat, heart
  muscle damage, apathy, insulin resistance, and cataracts. Certain embodiments provide a method
  of treating, preventing, delaying, or ameliorating symptoms and outcomes associated with
  development of DM1 in children, including, developmental delays, learning problems, language and
  speech issues, and personality development issues.

  counteract RNA dominance by directing the cleavage of pathogenic transcripts.

  Antisense Compounds
           Oligomeric compounds include, but are not limited to, oligonucleotides, oligonucleosides,
  oligonucleotide analogs, oligonucleotide mimetics, antisense compounds, antisense
  oligonucleotides, and siRNAs. An oligomeric compound can be "antisense" to a target nucleic acid,
  meaning that is capable of undergoing hybridization to a target nucleic acid through hydrogen
  bonding.
           In certain embodiments, an antisense compound has a nucleobase sequence that, when
  written in the 5' to 3' direction, comprises the reverse complement of the target segment of a target
  nucleic acid to which it is targeted. In certain such embodiments, an antisense oligonucleotide has a
  nucleobase sequence that, when written in the 5' to 3' direction, comprises the reverse complement
  of the target segment of a target nucleic acid to which it is targeted.
0          In certain embodiments, an antisense compound targeted to DMPK as described herein is 10
  to 30 nucleotides in length. In other words, the antisense compounds are in some embodiments
  from 10 to 30 linked nucleobases. In other embodiments, the antisense compound comprises a
  modified oligonucleotide consisting of 8 to 80, 10 to 80, 12 to 30, 12 to 50, 15 to 30, 18 to 24, 19 to
  22, or 20 linked nucleobases. In certain such embodiments, the antisense compound comprises a
5 modified oligonucleotide consisting of 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,

  embodiments, antisense compounds of any of these lengths contain at least 8, at least 9, at least 10,

  at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 16, at least 17, at least 18, or at least
  19, contiguous nucleobases of the nucleobase sequence of any of the exemplary antisense
  compounds described herein (e.g., at least 8 contiguous nucleobases of a nucleobase sequence
 recited in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 12-156, 160-770, and 774-792.
          In certain embodiments, the antisense compound comprises a shortened or truncated
 modified oligonucleotide. The shortened or truncated modified oligonucleotide can have a single
 nucleoside deleted from the 5' end (5' truncation), or alternatively from the 3' end (3' truncation).
 A shortened or truncated oligonucleotide can have two nucleosides deleted from the 5' end, or
 alternatively can have two subunits deleted from the 3' end. Alternatively, the deleted nucleosides
 can be dispersed throughout the modified oligonucleotide, for example, in an antisense compound
 having one nucleoside deleted from the 5' end and one nucleoside deleted from the 3' end.
          When a single additional nucleoside is present in a lengthened oligonucleotide, the additional
 nucleoside can be located at the 5' or 3' end of the oligonucleotide. When two or more additional
 nucleosides are present, the added nucleosides can be adjacent to each other, for example, in an
 oligonucleotide having two nucleosides added to the 5' end (5' addition), or alternatively to the 3'
 end (3' addition), of the oligonucleotide. Alternatively, the added nucleoside can be dispersed
 throughout the antisense compound, for example, in an oligonucleotide having one nucleoside added
 to the 5' end and one subunit added to the 3' end.
          It is possible to increase or decrease the length of an antisense compound, such as an
 antisense oligonucleotide, and/or introduce mismatch bases without eliminating activity. For
example, in Woolf et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:7305-7309, 1992), a series of antisense
oligonucleotides 13-25 nucleobases in length were tested for their ability to induce cleavage of a
target RNA in an oocyte injection model. Antisense oligonucleotides 25 nucleobases in length with
 8 or 11 mismatch bases near the ends of the antisense oligonucleotides were able to direct specific
cleavage of the target mRNA, albeit to a lesser extent than the antisense oligonucleotides that
contained no mismatches. Similarly, target specific cleavage was achieved using 13 nucleobase
antisense oligonucleotides, including those with 1 or 3 mismatches.
          Gautschi et al (J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 93:463-471, March 2001) demonstrated the ability of
an oligonucleotide having 100% complementarity to the bcl-2 mRNA and having 3 mismatches to
the bcl-xL mRNA to reduce the expression of both bcl-2 and bcl-xL in vitro and in vivo.
Furthermore, this oligonucleotide demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in vivo.

         Maher and Dolnick (Nuc. Acid. Res. 16:3341-3358, 1988) tested a series of tandem 14
 nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides, and a 28 and 42 nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides
 comprised of the sequence of two or three of the tandem antisense oligonucleotides, respectively, for
 their ability to arrest translation of human DHFR in a rabbit reticulocyte assay. Each of the three 14
 nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides alone was able to inhibit translation, albeit at a more modest
 level than the 28 or 42 nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides.
Antisense Compound Motifs
         In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to a DMPK nucleic acid have
 chemically modified subunits arranged in patterns, or motifs, to confer to the antisense compounds
properties such as enhanced the inhibitory activity, increased binding affinity for a target nucleic
acid, or resistance to degradation by in vivo nucleases.
         Chimeric antisense compounds typically contain at least one region modified so as to confer
increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, increased binding affinity for
the target nucleic acid, and/or increased inhibitory activity. A second region of a chimeric antisense
compound can optionally serve as a substrate for the cellular endonuclease RNase H, which cleaves
the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex.
         Antisense compounds having a gapmer motif are considered chimeric antisense compounds.
In a gapmer an internal region having a plurality of nucleotides that supports RNaseH cleavage is
positioned between external regions having a plurality of nucleotides that are chemically distinct
from the nucleosides of the internal region. In the case of an antisense oligonucleotide having a
gapmer motif, the gap segment generally serves as the substrate for endonuclease cleavage, while
the wing segments comprise modified nucleosides. In certain embodiments, the regions of a gapmer
are differentiated by the types of sugar moieties comprising each distinct region. The types of sugar
moieties that are used to differentiate the regions of a gapmer can in some embodiments include      p
D-ribonucleosides, P-D-deoxyribonucleosides, 2'-modified nucleosides (such 2'-modified
nucleosides can include 2'-MOE, and 2'-O-CH3 , among others), and bicyclic sugar modified
nucleosides (such bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides can include those having a 4'-(CH2)n-O-2'
bridge, where n=1 or n=2). Preferably, each distinct region comprises uniform sugar moieties. The
wing-gap-wing motif is frequently described as "X-Y-Z", where "X" represents the length of the 5'
wing region, "Y" represents the length of the gap region, and "Z" represents the length of the 3'
wing region. As used herein, a gapmer described as "X-Y-Z" has a configuration such that the gap
                                                    25

  segment is positioned immediately adjacent each of the 5' wing segment and the 3' wing segment.
  Thus, no intervening nucleotides exist between the 5' wing segment and gap segment, or the gap
  segment and the 3' wing segment. Any of the antisense compounds described herein can have a
  gapmer motif. In some embodiments, X and Z are the same, in other embodiments they are
  different. In a preferred embodiment, Y is between 8 and 15 nucleotides. X, Y or Z can be any of 1,
  2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30 or more nucleotides. Thus,
  gapmers include, but are not limited to, for example 5-10-5, 4-8-4, 4-12-3, 4-12-4, 3-14-3, 2-13-5, 2
   16-2, 1-18-1, 3-10-3, 2-10-2, 1-10-1, 2-8-2, 6-8-6, 5-8-5, 1-8-1, or 2-6-2.

  configuration. Thus, wingmer configurations include, but are not limited to, for example 5-10, 8-4,
  4-12, 12-4, 3-14, 16-2, 18-1, 10-3, 2-10, 1-10, 8-2, 2-13, or 5-13.

  least 16, at least 17, at least 18, or at least 19, contiguous nucleobases of the nucleobase sequence of

  GenBank Accession No. NM_001100.3 (incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 801). It is understood
  that the sequence set forth in each SEQ ID NO in the Examples contained herein is independent of
  any modification to a sugar moiety, an internucleoside linkage, or a nucleobase. As such, antisense
  compounds defined by a SEQ ID NO can comprise, independently, one or more modifications to a
  sugar moiety, an internucleoside linkage, or a nucleobase. Antisense compounds described by Isis
  Number (Isis No) indicate a combination of nucleobase sequence and motif.
          In certain embodiments, a target region is a structurally defined region of the target nucleic
  acid. For example, a target region can encompass a 3' UTR, a 5' UTR, an exon, an intron; an -
  exon/intron junction, a coding region, a translation initiation region, translation termination region,
  or other defined nucleic acid region. The structurally defined regions for DMPK can be obtained by
  accession number from sequence databases such as NCBI and such information is incorporated
  herein by reference. In certain embodiments, a target region can encompass the sequence from a 5'
  target site of one target segment within the target region to a 3' target site of another target segment
  within the target region.
          Targeting includes determination of at least one target segment to which an antisense
  compound hybridizes, such that a desired effect occurs. In certain embodiments, the desired effect
5 is a reduction in mRNA target nucleic acid levels. In certain embodiments, the desired effect is
  reduction of levels of protein encoded by the target nucleic acid or a phenotypic change associated
  with the target nucleic acid.
          A target region can contain one or more target segments. Multiple target segments within a
  target region can be overlapping. Alternatively, they can be non-overlapping. In certain
0 embodiments, target segments within a target region are separated by no more than about 300
  nucleotides. In certain embodiments, target segments within a target region are separated by a
                                                      27

  90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, or 10 nucleotides on the target nucleic acid, or is a range defined by
  any two of the preceding values. In certain embodiments, target segments within a target region are
  separated by no more than, or no more than about, 5 nucleotides on the target nucleic acid. In
  certain embodiments, target segments are contiguous. Contemplated are target regions defined by a
  range having a starting nucleic acid that is any of the 5' target sites or 3' target sites listed herein.
           Suitable target segments can be found within a 5' UTR, a coding region, a 3' UTR, an intron,
  an exon, or an exon/intron junction. Target segments containing a start codon or a stop codon are
  also suitable target segments. A suitable target segment can specifically exclude a certain
  structurally defined region such as the start codon or stop codon.
          The determination of suitable target segments can include a comparison of the sequence of a
  target nucleic acid to other sequences throughout the genome. For example, the BLAST algorithm
  can be used to identify regions of similarity amongst different nucleic acids. This comparison can
  prevent the selection of antisense compound sequences that can hybridize in a non-specific manner
  to sequences other than a selected target nucleic acid (i.e., non-target or off-target sequences).
          There can be variation in activity (e.g., as defined by percent reduction of target nucleic acid
  levels) of the antisense compounds within an active target region. In certain embodiments,
  reductions in DMPK mRNA levels are indicative of inhibition of DMPK protein expression.
  Reductions in levels of a DMPK protein are also indicative of inhibition of target mRNA
  expression. Further, phenotypic changes, such as a reducing myotonia or reducing spliceopathy, can
  be indicative of inhibition of DMPK mRNA and/or protein expression.
  Hybridization
          In some embodiments, hybridization occurs between an antisense compound disclosed
  herein and a DMPK nucleic acid. The most common mechanism of hybridization involves
5 hydrogen bonding (e.g., Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding)
  between complementary nucleobases of the nucleic acid molecules.
          Hybridization can occur under varying conditions. Stringent conditions are sequence
  dependent and are determined by the nature and composition of the nucleic acid molecules to be
  hybridized.

            Methods of determining whether a sequence is specifically hybridizable to a target nucleic
  acid are well known in the art (Sambrooke and Russell, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,
  3 rd Ed., 2001). In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds provided herein are specifically
  hybridizable with a DMPK nucleic acid.
  Complementarity
            An antisense compound and a target nucleic acid are complementary to each other when a
  sufficient number of nucleobases of the antisense compound can hydrogen bond with the
  corresponding nucleobases of the target nucleic acid, such that a desired effect will occur (e.g.,
  antisense inhibition of a target nucleic acid, such as a DMPK nucleic acid).
            An antisense compound can hybridize over one or more segments of a DMPK nucleic acid
  such that intervening or adjacent segments are not involved in the hybridization event (e.g., a loop
  structure, mismatch or hairpin structure).
            In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds provided herein, or a specified portion
  thereof, are, or are at least, 70%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%,
  95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% complementary to a DMPK nucleic did, a target region,
  target segment, or specified portion thereof. In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds are
  at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at
  least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least
  97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100% complementary to a DMPK nucleic acid, a target region,
D target segment, or specified portion thereof, and contain at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11,
  at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 16, at least 17, at least 18, or at least 19,
  contiguous nucleobases of the nucleobase sequence of any of the exemplary antisense compounds
  described herein (e.g., at least 8 contiguous nucleobases of a nucleobase sequence recited in any one
  of SEQ ID NOs: 12-156, 160-770, and 774-792). Percent complementarity of an antisense
5 compound with a target nucleic acid can be determined using routine methods, and is measured over
  the entirety of the antisense compound.
            For example, an antisense compound in which 18 of 20 nucleobases of the antisense
  compound are complementary to a target region, and would therefore specifically hybridize, would
  represent 90 percent complementarity. In this example, the remaining noncomplementary
) nucleobases can be clustered or interspersed with complementary nucleobases and need not be
                                                           29

       WO 2012/012443                                                          PCT/US2011/044555
  contiguous to each other or to complementary nucleobases. As such, an antisense compound which
  is 18 nucleobases in length having 4 (four) noncomplementary nucleobases which are flanked by
  two regions of complete complementarity with the target nucleic acid would have 77.8% overall
  complementarity with the target nucleic acid and would thus fall within the scope of the present
  invention. Percent complementarity of an antisense compound with a region of a target nucleic acid
  can be determined routinely using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search tools) and
  PowerBLAST programs known in the art (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1990, 215, 403 410; Zhang
  and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649 656). Percent homology, sequence identity or
  complementarity, can be determined by, for example, the Gap program (Wisconsin Sequence
  Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park,
  Madison Wis.), using default settings, which uses the algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Adv.
  Appl. Math., 1981, 2, 482 489).
          In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds provided herein, or specified portions
  thereof, are fully complementary (i.e. 100% complementary) to a target nucleic acid, or specified
  portion thereof. For example, antisense compound can be fully complementary to a DMPK nucleic
  acid, or a target region, or a target segment or target sequence thereof. -As used herein, "fully
  complementary" means each nucleobase of an antisense compound is capable of precise base
  pairing with the corresponding nucleobases of a target nucleic acid. For example, a 20 nucleobase
  antisense compound is fully complementary to a target sequence that is 400 nucleobases long, so
  long as there is a corresponding 20 nucleobase portion of the target nucleic acid that is fully
  complementary to the antisense compound. Fully complementary can also be used in reference to a
  specified portion of the first and /or the second nucleic acid. For example, a 20 nucleobase portion
  of a 30 nucleobase antisense compound can be "fully complementary" to a target sequence that is
  400 nucleobases long. The 20 nucleobase portion of the 30 nucleobase oligonucleotide is fully
5 complementary to the target sequence if the target sequence has a corresponding 20 nucleobase
  portion wherein each nucleobase is complementary to the 20 nucleobase portion of the antisense
  compound. At the same time, the entire 30 nucleobase antisense compound can be fully
  complementary to the target sequence, depending on whether the remaining 10 nucleobases of the
  antisense compound are also complementary to the target sequence.
)         The location of a non-complementary nucleobase can be at the 5' end or 3' end of the
  antisense compound. Alternatively, the non-complementary nucleobase or nucleobases can be at an
                                                      30

   internal position of the antisense compound. When two or more non-complementary nucleobases
   are present, they can be either contiguous (i.e. linked) or non-contiguous. In one embodiment, a
  non-complementary nucleobase is located in the wing segment of a gapmer antisense
  oligonucleotide.
            In certain embodiments, antisense compounds that are, or are up to 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
   18, 19, or 20 nucleobases in length comprise no more than 4, no more than 3, no more than 2, or no
  more than 1 non-complementary nucleobase(s) relative to a target nucleic acid, such as a DMPK
  nucleic acid, or specified portion thereof.
            In certain embodiments, antisense compounds that are, or are up to 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
   18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 nucleobases in length comprise no more than 6,
  no more than 5, no more than 4, no more than 3, no more than 2, or no more than 1 non
  complementary nucleobase(s) relative to a target nucleic acid, such as a DMPK nucleic acid, or
  specified portion thereof.
            The antisense compounds provided herein also include those which are complementary to a
  portion of a target nucleic acid. As used herein, "portion" refers to a defined number of contiguous
  (i.e. linked) nucleobases within a region or segment of a target nucleic acid. A "portion" can also
  refer to a defined number of contiguous nucleobases of an antisense compound. In certain
  embodiments, the antisense compounds, are complementary to at least an 8 nucleobase portion of a
  target segment. In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds are complementary to at least a
  10 nucleobase portion of a target segment. In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds are
  complementary to at least a 15 nucleobase portion of a target segment. Also contemplated are
  antisense compounds that are complementary to at least an 8, at least a 9, at least a 10, at least an 11,
  at least a 12, at least a 13, at least a 14, at least a 15, at least a 16, at least a 17, at least an 18, at least
  a 19, at least a 20, or more nucleobase portion of a target segment, or a range defined by any two of
5 these values.
  Identity
           The antisense compounds provided herein can also have a defined percent identity to a
  particular nucleotide sequence, SEQ ID NO, or compound represented by a specific Isis number, or
  portion thereof. As used herein, an antisense compound is identical to the sequence disclosed herein
j if it has the same nucleobase pairing ability. For example, a RNA which contains uracil in place of
                                                          31

  thymidine in a disclosed DNA sequence would be considered identical to the DNA sequence since
  both uracil and thymidine pair with adenine. Shortened and lengthened versions of the antisense
  compounds described herein as well as compounds having non-identical bases relative to the
  antisense compounds provided herein also are contemplated. The non-identical bases can be
  adjacent to each other or dispersed throughout the antisense compound. Percent identity of an
  antisense compound is calculated according to the number of bases that have identical base pairing
  relative to the sequence to which it is being compared.
          In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds, or portions thereof, are at least 70%, at
  least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least
  98%, at least 99% or 100% identical to one or more of the exemplary antisense compounds or SEQ
  ID NOs, or a portion thereof, disclosed herein.
  Modifications
          A nucleoside is a base-sugar combination. The nucleobase (also known as base) portion of
  the nucleoside is normally a heterocyclic base moiety. Nucleotides are nucleosides that further
  include a phosphate group covalently linked to the sugar portion of the nucleoside. For those
  nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to the 2', 3' or 5'
  hydroxyl moiety of the sugar. Oligonucleotides are formed through the covalent linkage of adjacent
  nucleosides to one another, to form a linear polymeric oligonucleotide. Within the oligonucleotide
  structure, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as forming the internucleoside linkages of
  the oligonucleotide.
          Modifications to antisense compounds encompass substitutions or changes to internucleoside
  linkages, sugar moieties, or nucleobases. Modified antisense compounds are often preferred over
  native forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake,
  enhanced affinity for nucleic acid target, increased stability in the presence of nucleases, or
5 increased inhibitory activity.
          Chemically modified nucleosides can also be employed to increase the binding affinity of a
  shortened or truncated antisense oligonucleotide for its target nucleic acid. Consequently,
  comparable results can often be obtained with shorter antisense compounds that have such
  chemically modified nucleosides.

  Modified InternucleosideLinkages
           The naturally occurring internucleoside linkage of RNA and DNA is a 3' to 5' phosphodiester
  linkage. Antisense compounds having one or more modified, i.e. non-naturally occurring,
  internucleoside linkages are often selected over antisense compounds having naturally occurring
  internucleoside linkages because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular
  uptake, enhanced affinity for target nucleic acids, and increased stability in the presence of
  nucleases.
           Oligonucleotides having modified internucleoside linkages include internucleoside linkages
  that retain a phosphorus atom as well as internucleoside linkages that do not have a phosphorus
  atom. Representative phosphorus containing internucleoside linkages include, but are not limited to,
  phosphodiesters, phosphotriesters, methylphosphonates, phosphoramidate, and phosphorothioates.
  Methods of preparation of phosphorous-containing and non-phosphorous-containing linkages are
  well known.
           In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to a DMPK nucleic acid comprise
  one or more modified internucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, the modified
  internucleoside linkages are phosphorothioate linkages. In certain embodiments, each
  intemucleoside linkage of an antisense compound is a phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage.
  Modified Sugar Moieties
            Antisense compounds of the invention can optionally contain one or more nucleosides
0 wherein the sugar group has been modified. Such sugar modified nucleosides may impart enhanced
  nuclease stability, increased binding affinity, or some other beneficial biological property to the
  antisense compounds. In certain embodiments, nucleosides comprise chemically modified
  ribofuranose ring moieties. Examples of chemically modified ribofuranose rings include without
  limitation, addition of substitutent groups (including 5' and 2' substituent groups, bridging of non
5 geminal ring atoms to form bicyclic nucleic acids (BNA), replacement of the ribosyl ring oxygen
  atom with S, N(R), or C(R1 )(R2) (R, R1 and R2 are each independently H, C1 -C12 alkyl or a
  protecting group) and combinations thereof. Examples of chemically modified sugars include 2'-F
  5'-methyl substituted nucleoside (see PCT International Application WO 2008/101157 Published on
  8/21/08 for other disclosed 5',2'-bis substituted nucleosides) or replacement of the ribosyl ring
0 oxygen atom with S with further substitution at the 2'-position (see published U.S. Patent
  Application US2005-0130923, published on June 16, 2005) or alternatively 5'-substitution of a BNA

  compounds provided herein include one or more BNA nucleosides wherein the bridge comprises

           In nucleotides having modified sugar moieties, the nucleobase moieties (natural, modified
 or a combination thereof) are maintained for hybridization with an appropriate nucleic acid target.
           In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to a DMPK nucleic acid comprise
 one or more nucleotides having modified sugar moieties. In certain embodiments, the modified
 sugar moiety is 2'-MOE. In certain embodiments, the 2'-MOE modified nucleotides are arranged in
 a gapmer motif.
 Modified Nucleobases
         Nucleobase (or base) modifications or substitutions are structurally distinguishable from, yet
 functionally interchangeable with, naturally occurring or synthetic unmodified nucleobases. Both
 natural and modified nucleobases are capable of participating in hydrogen bonding. Such
 nucleobase modifications can impart nuclease stability, binding affinity or some other beneficial
 biological property to antisense compounds. Modified nucleobases include synthetic and natural
 nucleobases such as, for example, 5-methylcytosine (5-me-C). Certain nucleobase substitutions,
 including 5-methylcytosine substitutions, are particularly useful for increasing the binding affinity
 of an antisense compound for a target nucleic acid. For example, 5-methylcytosine substitutions
have been shown to increase nucleic acid duplex stability by 0.6-1.2*C (Sanghvi, Y.S., Crooke, S.T.
 and Lebleu, B., eds., Antisense Research and Applications, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1993, pp. 276
278).
         Additional unmodified nucleobases include 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine, xanthine,
hypoxanthine, 2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2
propyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-thiouracil, 2-thiothymine and 2
thiocytosine, 5-halouracil and cytosine, 5-propynyl (-C=C-CH 3) uracil and cytosine and other
alkynyl derivatives of pyrimidine bases, 6-azo uracil, cytosine and thymine, 5-uracil (pseudouracil),
4-thiouracil, 8-halo, 8-amino, 8-thiol, 8-thioalkyl, 8-hydroxyl and other 8-substituted adenines and
guanines, 5-halo particularly 5-bromo, 5-trifluoromethyl and other 5-substituted uracils and
cytosines, 7-methylguanine and 7-methyladenine, 2-F-adenine, 2-amino-adenine, 8-azaguanine and
8-azaadenine, 7-deazaguanine and 7-deazaadenine and 3-deazaguanine and 3-deazaadenine.
        Heterocyclic base moieties can also include those in which the purine or pyrimidine base is
replaced with other heterocycles, for example 7-deaza-adenine, 7-deazaguanosine, 2-aminopyridine
and 2-pyridone. Nucleobases that are particularly useful for increasing the binding affinity of

           In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to a DMPK nucleic acid comprise
  one or more modified nucleobases. In certain embodiments, gap-widened antisense
  oligonucleotides targeted to a DMPK nucleic acid comprise one or more modified nucleobases. In
  certain embodiments, the modified nucleobase is 5-methylcytosine. In certain embodiments, each
  cytosine is a 5-methylcytosine.
  Compositions and Methodsfor FormulatingPharmaceuticalCompositions
           Antisense oligonucleotides can be admixed with pharmaceutically acceptable active or inert
  substance for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions or formulations. Compositions and
  methods for the formulation of pharmaceutical compositions are dependent upon a number of
  criteria, including, but not limited to, route of administration, extent of disease, or dose to be
  administered.
           Antisense compound targeted to a DMPK nucleic acid can be utilized in pharmaceutical
  compositions by combining the antisense compound with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable
  diluent or carrier. A pharmaceutically acceptable diluent includes phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
  PBS is a diluent suitable for use in compositions to be delivered parenterally. Accordingly, in one
  embodiment, employed in the methods described herein is a pharmaceutical composition comprising
  an antisense compound targeted to a DMPK nucleic acid and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent.
J In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable diluent is PBS. In certain embodiments,
  the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide.
           Pharmaceutical compositions comprising antisense compounds encompass any
  pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, or salts of such esters, or any other oligonucleotide which,
  upon administration to an animal, including a human, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly)
5 the biologically active metabolite or residue thereof. Accordingly, for example, the disclosure is
  also drawn to pharmaceutically acceptable salts of antisense compounds, prodrugs, pharmaceutically
  acceptable salts of such prodrugs, and other bioequivalents. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable
  salts include, but are not limited to, sodium and potassium salts.

         A prodrug can include the incorporation of additional nucleosides at one or both ends of an
 antisense compound which are cleaved by endogenous nucleases within the body, to form the active
 antisense compound.
 ConjugatedAntisense Compounds
         Antisense compounds can be covalently linked to one or more moieties or conjugates which
 enhance the activity, cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the resulting antisense
 oligonucleotides. Typical conjugate groups include cholesterol moieties and lipid moieties.
 Additional conjugate groups include carbohydrates, phospholipids, biotin, phenazine, folate,
 phenanthridine, anthraquinone, acridine, fluoresceins, rhodamines, coumarins, and dyes.
         Antisense compounds can also be modified to have one or more stabilizing groups that are
 generally attached to one or both termini of antisense compounds to enhance properties such as, for
 example, nuclease stability. Included in stabilizing groups are cap structures. These terminal
 modifications protect the antisense compound having terminal nucleic acid from exonuclease
 degradation, and can help in delivery and/or localization within a cell. The cap can be present at the
 5'-terminus (5'-cap), or at the 3'-terminus (3'-cap), or can be present on both termini. Cap structures
are well known in the art and include, for example, inverted deoxy abasic caps. Further 3' and 5'
stabilizing groups that can be used to cap one or both ends of an antisense compound to impart
nuclease stability include those disclosed in WO 03/004602 published on January 16, 2003.
Cell culture and antisense compounds treatment
         The effects of antisense compounds on the level, activity or expression of DMPK nucleic
acids can be tested in vitro in a variety of cell types. Cell types used for such analyses are available
from commercial vendors (e.g. American Type Culture Collection, Manassus, VA; Zen-Bio, Inc.,
Research Triangle Park, NC; Clonetics Corporation, Walkersville, MD) and cells are cultured
according to the vendor's instructions using commercially available reagents (e.g. Invitrogen Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Illustrative cell types include, but are not limited to, HepG2 cells,
Hep3B cells, primary hepatocytes, A549 cells, GM04281 fibroblasts and LLC-MK2 cells.
In vitro testing of antisense oligonucleotides
        Described herein are methods for treatment of cells with antisense oligonucleotides, which
can be modified appropriately for treatment with other antisense compounds.

         In general, cells are treated with antisense oligonucleotides when the cells reach
 approximately 60-80% confluence in culture.
         One reagent commonly used to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into cultured cells
 includes the cationic lipid transfection reagent LIPOFECTIN@ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
 Antisense oligonucleotides are mixed with LIPOFECTIN@ in OPTI-MEM@ 1 (Invitrogen,
 Carlsbad, CA) to achieve the desired final concentration of antisense oligonucleotide and a
LIPOFECTIN@ concentration that typically ranges 2 to 12 ug/mL per 100 nM antisense
 oligonucleotide.
         Another reagent used to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into cultured cells includes
LIPOFECTAMINE 2000@ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Antisense oligonucleotide is mixed with
LIPOFECTAMINE 2000@ in OPTI-MEM@ 1 reduced serum medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
to achieve the desired concentration of antisense oligonucleotide and a LIPOFECTAMINE@
concentration that typically ranges 2 to 12 ug/mL per 100 nM antisense oligonucleotide.
        Another reagent used to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into cultured cells includes
Cytofectin@ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Antisense oligonucleotide is mixed with Cytofectin@ in
OPTI-MEM@ 1 reduced serum medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to achieve the desired
concentration of antisense oligonucleotide and a Cytofectin@ concentration that typically ranges 2 to
 12 ug/mL per 100 nM antisense oligonucleotide.
        Another technique used to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into cultured cells includes
electroporation.
        Cells are treated with antisense oligonucleotides by routine methods. Cells are typically
harvested 16-24 hours after antisense oligonucleotide treatment, at which time RNA or protein
levels of target nucleic acids are measured by methods known in the art and described herein. In
general, when treatments are performed in multiple replicates, the data are presented as the average
of the replicate treatments.
        The concentration of antisense oligonucleotide used varies from cell line to cell line.
Methods to determine the optimal antisense oligonucleotide concentration for a particular cell line
are well known in the art. Antisense oligonucleotides are typically used at concentrations ranging
from I nM to 300 nM when transfected with LIPOFECTAMINE2000@, Lipofectin or Cytofectin.

   Antisense oligonucleotides are used at higher concentrations ranging from 625 to 20,000 nM when
   transfected using electroporation.
   RNA Isolation
           RNA analysis can be performed on total cellular RNA or poly(A)+ mRNA. Methods of
   RNA isolation are well known in the art. RNA is prepared using methods well known in the art, for
   example, using the TRIZOL@ Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's
  recommended protocols.
  Analysis of inhibition of target levels or expression
           Inhibition of levels or expression of a DMPK nucleic acid can be assayed in a variety of
  ways known in the art. For example, target nucleic acid levels can be quantitated by, e.g., Northern
  blot analysis, competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or quantitaive real-time PCR. RNA
  analysis can be performed on total cellular RNA or poly(A)+ mRNA. Methods of RNA isolation
  are well known in the art. Northern blot analysis is also routine in the art. Quantitative real-time
  PCR can be conveniently accomplished using the commercially available ABI PRISM@ 7600, 7700,
  or 7900 Sequence Detection System, available from PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA and
  used according to manufacturer's instructions.
  QuantitativeReal-Time PCR Analysis of Target RNA Levels
           Quantitation of target RNA levels can be accomplished by quantitative real-time PCR using
  the ABI PRISM@ 7600, 7700, or 7900 Sequence Detection System (PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster
) City, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Methods of quantitative real-time PCR are well
  known in the art.
          Prior to real-time PCR, the isolated RNA is subjected to a reverse transcriptase (RT)
  reaction, which produces complementary DNA (cDNA) that is then used as the substrate for the
  real-time PCR amplification. The RT and real-time PCR reactions are performed sequentially in the
  same sample well. RT and real-time PCR reagents are obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).
  RT, real-time-PCR reactions are carried out by methods well known to those skilled in the art.
          Gene (or RNA) target quantities obtained by real time PCR are normalized using either the
  expression level of a gene whose expression is constant, such as cyclophilin A, or by quantifying
  total RNA using RIBOGREEN@ (Invitrogen, Inc. Carlsbad, CA). Cyclophilin A expression is
                                                     47

   quantified by real time PCR, by being run simultaneously with the target, multiplexing, or
   separately. Total RNA is quantified using RIBOGREEN@ RNA quantification reagent (Invitrogen,
   Inc. Eugene, OR). Methods of RNA quantification by RIBOGREEN@ are taught in Jones, L.J., et
   al, (Analytical Biochemistry, 1998, 265, 368-374). A CYTOFLUOR@ 4000 instrument (PE
   Applied Biosystems) is used to measure RIBOGREEN@ fluorescence.
            Probes and primers are designed to hybridize to a DMPK nucleic acid. Methods for
   designing real-time PCR probes and primers are well known in the art, and can include the use of
   software such as PRIMER EXPRESS@ Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
  Analysis of ProteinLevels
            Antisense inhibition of DMPK nucleic acids can be assessed by measuring DMPK protein
   levels. Protein levels of DMPK can be evaluated or quantitated in a variety of ways well known in
  the art, such as immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis (immunoblotting), enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative protein assays, protein activity assays (for example,
   caspase activity assays), immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry or fluorescence-activated
   cell sorting (FACS). Antibodies directed to a target can be identified and obtained from a-variety of
   sources, such as the MSRS catalog of antibodies (Aerie Corporation, Birmingham, MI), or can be
  prepared via conventional monoclonal or polyclonal antibody generation methods well known in the
  art.
  In vivo testing of antisense compounds
D          Antisense compounds, for example, antisense oligonucleotides, are tested in animals to
  assess their ability to inhibit expression of DMPK and produce phenotypic changes. Testing can be
  performed in normal animals, or in experimental disease models, for example, the HSALR mouse
  model of myotonic dystrophy (DM1).
           The HSALR mouse model is an established model for DM1 (Mankodi, A. et al. Science.
5 289: 1769, 2000). The mice carry a human skeletal actin (hA CTA1) transgene with 220 CTG
  repeats inserted in the 3' UTR of the gene. The hACTA1-CUGexP transcript accumulates in nuclear
  foci in skeletal muscles and results in myotonia similar to that in human DM1 (Mankodi, A. et al.
  Mol. Cell 10: 35, 2002; Lin, X. et al. Hum. Mol. Genet. 15: 2087, 2006). Hence, it is expected
  that amelioration of DM1 symptoms in the HSALR mouse by antisense inhibition of the hACTA1
                                                    48

     WO 2012/012443                                                           PCT/US2011/044555
transgene would predict amelioration of similar symptoms in human patients by antisense inhibition
of the DMPK transcript.
        Expression of CUGxP RNA in mice causes extensive remodeling of the muscle
transcriptome, much of which is reproduced by ablation of MBNL1. Hence, it is expected that
normalization of the transcriptome in HSALR mice would predict normalization of the human
transcriptome in DM1 patients by antisense inhibition of the DMPK transcript.
        For administration to animals, antisense oligonucleotides are formulated in a
pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, such as phosphate-buffered saline. Administration includes
parenteral routes of administration. Following a period of treatment with antisense oligonucleotides,
RNA is isolated from tissue and changes in DMPK nucleic acid expression are measured. Changes
in DMPK protein levels are also measured.
Splicing
        Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is caused by CTG repeat expansions in the 3' untranslated
region oftheiDMPK gene (Brook, J.D. et al. Cell. 68: 799, 1992). This mutation leadsto RNA
dominance, a process in which expression of RNA containing an expanded CUG repeat (CUGexp)
induces cell dysfunction (Osborne RJ and Thornton CA., Human Molecular Genetics., 2006, 15(2):
R162-Ri69). Such CUGexp are retained in the nuclear foci of skeletal muscles (Davis, B.M. et al.
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94:7388, 1997). The accumulation of CUGexp in the nuclear foci
leads to the sequestration of poly(CUG)-binding proteins, such as, Muscleblind-like 1 (MBLN1)
(Miller, J.W. et al. EMBO J. 19: 4439, 2000). MBLN1 is a splicing factor and regulates the
splicing of genes such as Sercal, CIC-1, Titin, and Zasp. Therefore, sequestration of MBLN1 by
CUGexp triggers misregulated alternative splicing of the exons of genes that MBLN1 normally
controls (Lin, X. et al. Hum. Mol. Genet. 15: 2087, 2006). Correction of alternative splicing in an
animal displaying such disregulation, such as, for example, in a DM1 patient and the HSALR mouse
model, is a useful indicator for the efficacy of a treatment, including treatment with an antisense
oligonucleotide.

  Certain Biomarkers
          DM1 severity in mouse models is determined, at least in part, by the level of CUGP
  transcript accumulation in the nucleus or nuclear foci. A useful physiological marker for DM1
  severity is the development of high-frequency runs of involuntary action potentials (myotonia).

   EXAMPLES
   Non-limiting disclosure and incorporation by reference
            While certain compounds, compositions and methods described herein have been described
   with specificity in accordance with certain embodiments, the following examples serve only to
   illustrate the compounds described herein and are not intended to limit the same. Each of the
   references recited in the present application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
   Example 1: Antisense inhibition of human dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) in
   human skeletal muscle cells (hSKMC)
            Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to a human DMPK nucleic acid were tested for their
   effect on DMPK RNA transcript in vitro. Cultured hSKM cells at a density of 20,000 cells per well
   were transfected using electroporation with 100 nM antisense oligonucleotide. After approximately
   24 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and DMPK RNA transcript levels were measured by
   quantitative real-time PCR with human primer probe set RTS3164 (forward sequence
  AGCCTGAGCCGGGAGATG, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 9; reverse sequence
   GCGTAGTTGACTGGCGAAGTT, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 10; probe sequence
  AGGCCATCCGCACGGACAACCX, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 11). DMPK RNA
  transcript levels were adjusted according to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN*.
  Results are presented as percent inhibition of hDMPK, relative to untreated control cells.
            The antisense oligonucleotides in Tables 1 and 2 are 5-10-5 gapmers, where the gap segment
D comprises ten 2'-deoxynucleosides and each wing segment comprises five 2'-MOE nucleosides.
  The internucleoside linkages throughout each gapmer are phosphorothioate (P=S) linkages. All
  cytosine residues throughout each gapmer are 5-methylcytosines. 'Target start site' indicates the 5'
  most nucleoside to which the antisense oligonucleotide is targeted. 'Target stop site' indicates the
  3'-most nucleoside to which the antisense oligonucleotide is targeted. All the antisense
  oligonucleotides listed in Table 1 target SEQ ID NO: 1 (GENBANK Accession No.
  NM_001081560.1). All the antisense oligonucleotides listed in Table 2 target SEQ ID NO: 2 (the
  complement of GENBANK Accession No. NT_011109.15 truncated from nucleotides 18540696 to
  18555106).
            Several antisense oligonucleotides demonstrated significant inhibition of human DMPK mRNA
  levels under the conditions specified above.

           The antisense oligonucleotides from Tables 1 and 2 were also tested in an assay with
  similar conditions as described above, and mRNA levels measured with the human primer probe
  RTS3162 (forward sequence CGGGCCGTCCGTGTT, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 157;
  reverse sequence CTTTGCACTTTGCGAACCAA, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 158; probe
D sequence CATCCTCCACGCACCCCCACCX, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 159). The results
  are presented in Table 3. DMPK mRNA expression was also assessed by RTS3162 which targets
  the DMPK gene near the 3'UTR. The use of a second primer probe was employed to confirm that
  the expression of the entire DMPK gene had been inhibited

Example 3: Dose-dependent antisense inhibition of human DMPK in human skeletal muscle
cells
        Several of the antisense oligonucleotides exhibiting in vitro inhibition of DMPK in hSKMC
(see Example 1) were tested at various doses. Cells were plated at a density of 20,000 cells per well
and transfected using electroporation with 1,250 nM, 2,500 nM, 5,000 nM, 10,000 nM and 20,000
nM concentrations of each antisense oligonucleotide. After approximately 16 hours, RNA was
isolated from the cells and DMPK mRNA transcript levels were measured by quantitative real-time
PCR using primer probe set RTS3164, described hereinabove. DMPK mRNA transcript levels were
normalized to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN*. Results are presented in Table 5
as percent inhibition of DMPK, relative to untreated control cells.
        The tested antisense oligonucleotides demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of DMPK
mRNA levels under the conditions specified above.

         The antisense oligonucleotides from Table 5 were also tested with primer probe set
RTS3162, described hereinabove. The results are presented in Table 6. DMPK mRNA expression
was also assessed by RTS3162 which targets the DMPK gene near the 3'UTR. The use of a second
primer probe was employed to confirm that the expression of the entire DMPK gene had been
inhibited.

Example 4: Dose-dependent antisense inhibition of human DMPK in human skeletal muscle
cells
         Several of the antisense oligonucleotides exhibiting in vitro inhibition of DMPK in hSKMC
(see Example 3) were tested at various doses. Cells were plated at a density of 20,000 cells per well
and transfected using electroporation with 1,250 nM, 2,500 nM, 5,000 nM, 10,000 nM and 20,000
nM concentrations of each antisense oligonucleotide. After approximately 16 hours, RNA was
isolated from the cells and DMPK mRNA transcript levels were measured by quantitative real-time
PCR using primer probe set RTS3164, described hereinabove. DMPK mRNA transcript levels were
normalized to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN*. Results are presented in Table 7
as percent inhibition of DMPK, relative to untreated control cells.
        The majority of the tested antisense oligonucleotides demonstrated dose-dependent
inhibition of DMPK mRNA levels under the conditions specified above.

 Example 5: Dose-dependent antisense inhibition of human DMPK in human skeletal muscle
 cells
         Several antisense oligonucleotides were designed to target human DMPK mRNA and were
 tested in hSKMC at various doses. Several other antisense oligonucleotides were designed to target
 human actin mRNA and were also tested in hSKMC at various doses. The newly designed gapmers
 are 2-10-2 MOE or 3-10-3 MOE gapmers. The 2-10-2 MOE gapmers are 14 nucleosides in length
 and where the gap segment comprises ten 2'-deoxynucleosides and each wing segment comprises
two 2'-MOE nucleosides. The 3-10-3 MOE gapmers are 16 nucleosides in length and where the gap
 segment comprises ten 2'-deoxynucleosides and each wing segment comprises three 2'-MOE
nucleosides. The internucleoside linkages throughout each gapmer are phosphorothioate (P=S)
linkages. All cytosine residues throughout each gapmer are 5-methylcytosines. 'Target start site'
indicates the 5'-most nucleoside to which the antisense oligonucleotide is targeted. 'Target stop
site' indicates the 3'-most nucleoside to which the antisense oligonucleotide is targeted. The
antisense oligonucleotides listed in Table 8 target either the human DMPK genomic sequence,
designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 2 (the complement of GENBANK Accession No. NT_011109.15
truncated from nucleotides 18540696 to 18555106) or the human actin sequence, designated herein as SEQ
ID NO: 801 (GENBANK Accession No. NM_001100.3).
         Cells were plated at a density of 20,000 cells per well and transfected using electroporation
with 1,250 nM, 2,500 nM, 5,000 nM, 10,000 nM and 20,000 nM concentrations of each antisense
oligonucleotide. After approximately 16 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and DMPK mRNA

          The mutant form of the DMPK mRNA, harboring large CUG repeats, are fully transcribed
  and polyadenylated, but remain trapped in the nucleus (Davis et al, 1997, Proc. Natl. Acad Sci.
  U. S. A. 94, 7388-7393). These mutant nuclear-retained mRNAs are one of the most important
  pathological features of myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). Antisense inhibition of mutant DMPK
  mRNA in DM1 fibroblast cells was studied.
          The DMPK gene normally has 5-37 CTG repeats in the 3' untranslated region. In myotonic
  dystrophy type I, this number is significantly expanded and may be in the range of 50 to greater than
  3,500 (Harper, Myotonic Dystrophy (Saunders, London, ed.3, 2001); Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 29: 259, 2006;
  EMBO J. 19: 4439, 2000; Curr Opin Neurol. 20: 572, 2007).DM1 fibroblast cells were plated at a density
  of 4,500 cells per well and transfected using Cytofectin reagent with 9.4 nM, 18.8 nM, 37.5 nM,
  75.0 nM, 150.0 nM, and 300.0 nM concentrations of each antisense oligonucleotide. After
  approximately 16 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and DMPK RNA transcript levels were
  measured by quantitative real-time PCR using primer probe set RTS3164, described hereinabove.
  DMPK RNA transcript levels were normalized to total RNA content, as measured by
  RIBOGREEN*. Results are presented in Table 10 as percent inhibition of DMPK, relative to
  untreated control cells.
          An assay with similar conditions was also performed with primer probe set RTS3162,
  described hereinabove, which targets the 3'-end of the DMPK transcript. Results are presented in
  Table 11 as percent inhibition of DMPK, relative to untreated control cells.
          The tested antisense oligonucleotides demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of DMPK
  mRNA levels under the conditions specified above.

   Example 7: Antisense inhibition of human DMPK in human skeletal muscle cells (hSKMc)
            Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to a human DMPK nucleic acid were tested for their
  effect on DMPK RNA transcript in vitro. Cultured hSKMc at a density of 20,000 cells per well
  were transfected using electroporation with 10,000 nM antisense oligonucleotide. After
  approximately 24 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and DMPK transcript levels were
  measured by quantitative real-time PCR. DMPK RNA transcript levels were adjusted according to
  total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN*. Results are presented as percent inhibition of
  DMPK, relative to untreated control cells.
           The antisense oligonucleotides in Tables 12 and 13 are 5-10-5 gapmers, where the gap
  segment comprises ten 2'-deoxynucleosides and each wing segment comprises five 2'-MOE
  nucleosides. The internucleoside linkages throughout each gapmer are phosphorothioate (P=S)
  linkages. All cytsoine residues throughout each gapmer are 5-methylcytosines. 'Target start site'
  indicates the 5'-most nucleoside to which the antisense oligonucleotide is targeted in the human
  genomic gene sequence. 'Target stop site' indicates the 3'-most nucleoside to which the antisense
  oligonucleotide is targeted in the human genomic sequence. All the antisense oligonucleotides
  listed in Table 12 target SEQ ID NO: 1 (GENBANK Accession No. NM_001081560.1). All the
) antisense oligonucleotides listed in Table 13 target SEQ ID NO: 2 (the complement of GENBANK
  Accession No. NT_011109.15 truncated from nucleotides 18540696 to 18555106).
            Several of the antisense oligonucleotides demonstrated significant inhibition of DMPK
  mRNA levels under the conditions specified above.

  Example 8: Antisense inhibition of murine DMPK in mouse primary hepatocytes
          Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to a murine DMPK nucleic acid were tested for their
  effect on DMPK RNA transcript in vitro. Cultured mouse primary hepatocytes at a density of
5 35,000 cells per well were transfected using electroporation with 8,000 nM antisense

  oligonucleotide. After approximately 24 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and DMPK
  transcript levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. DMPK RNA transcript levels were
  adjusted according to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN*. Results are presented as
  percent inhibition of DMPK, relative to untreated control cells.
           The antisense oligonucleotides in Tables 14, 15, and 16 are 5-10-5 gapmers, where the gap
  segment comprises ten 2'-deoxynucleosides and each wing segment comprises five 2'-MOE
  nucleosides. The internucleoside linkages throughout each gapmer are phosphorothioate (P=S)
  linkages. All cytosine residues throughout each gapmer are 5-methylcytosines. 'Murine Target start
  site' indicates the 5'-most nucleoside to which the antisense oligonucleotide is targeted in the
  murine gene sequence. 'Murine Target stop site' indicates the 3'-most nucleoside to which the
  antisense oligonucleotide is targeted in the murine gene sequence. All the antisense
  oligonucleotides listed in Table 12 target SEQ ID NO: 3 (GENBANK Accession No. NT_039413.7
  truncated from nucleotides 16666001 to 16681000). All the antisense oligonucleotides listed in
  Table 13 target SEQ ID NO: 4 (GENBANK Accession No. NM_032418.1). The antisense
  oligonucleotides of Table 14 target SEQ ID NO: 5 (GENBANK Accession No. A1007148.1), SEQ
  ID NO: 6 (GENBANK Accession No. -A1304033.1), SEQ ID NO: 7 (GENBANK Accession No.
  BC024150.1), SEQ ID NO: 8 (GENBANK Accession No. BC056615.1), SEQ ID NO: 793
  (GENBANK Accession No. BC075715.1), SEQ ID NO: 794 (GENBANK Accession No.
  BU519245.1), SEQ ID NO: 795 (GENBANK Accession No. CB247909.1), SEQ ID NO: 796
  (GENBANK Accession No. CX208906.1), SEQ ID NO: 797 (GENBANK Accession No.
  CX732022.1), SEQ ID NO: 798 (GENBANK Accession No. S60315.1), or SEQ ID NO: 799
  (GENBANK Accession No. S60316.1). In addition, the human antisense oligonucleotide ISIS
  451421 targeting SEQ ID NO: 800(GENBANK Accession No. NM_001081562.1) was also
  included in this assay and is listed in Table 14.
5         The murine oligonucleotides of Tables 14, 15, and 16 may also be cross-reactive with human
  gene sequences. 'Mismatches' indicate the number of nucleobases by which the murine
  oligonucleotide is mismatched with a human gene sequence. The greater the complementarity
  between the murine oligonucleotide and the human sequence, the more likely the murine
  oligonucleotide can cross-react with the human sequence. The murine oligonucleotides in Tables
0 14, 15, and 16 were compared to SEQ ID NO: 800 (GENBANK Accession No. NM_001081562.1).
  "Human Target start site" indicates the 5'-most nucleoside to which the gapmer is targeted in the

gapmer is targeted human gene sequence.
        Several of the tested antisense oligonucleotides demonstrated significant inhibition of
DMPK mRNA levels under the conditions specified above. Certain of the tested antisense
oligonucleotides are cross-reactive with human gene sequences.

  Example 10: Antisense inhibition of human alphal skeletal actin in HepG2 cells
           Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to a human alphal skeletal actin nucleic acid, a gene
  which may carry an expanded CTG repeat capable of causing symptoms of DMl when inserted into
  mouse models, were tested for their effect on alphal actin RNA transcript in vitro. Cultured HepG2
  cells at a density of 20,000 cells per well were transfected using electroporation with 10,000 nM
  antisense oligonucleotide. After approximately 24 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and
  alphal actin RNA transcript levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Alphal actin
D RNA transcript levels were adjusted according to total RNA content, as measured by
  RIBOGREEN*. Results are presented as percent inhibition of alphal actin, relative to untreated
  control cells.
           The antisense oligonucleotides in Table 18 are 5-10-5 gapmers, where the gap segment
  comprises ten 2'-deoxynucleosides and each wing segment comprises five 2'-MOE nucleosides.
5 The internucleoside linkages throughout each gapmer are phosphorothioate (P=S) linkages. All
  cytosine residues throughout each gapmer are 5-methylcytosines. 'Target start site' indicates the 5'
  most nucleoside to which the antisense oligonucleotide is targeted. 'Target stop site' indicates the
  3'-most nucleoside to which the antisense oligonucleotide is targeted. All the antisense
  oligonucleotides listed in Table 18 target SEQ ID NO: 801 (GENBANK Accession No.

  Example 12: In vivo antisense inhibition of human alphal actin by intramuscular
  administration in transgenic mice
          To test the effect ofantisense inhibition for the treatment of myotonic dystrophy, an
  appropriate mouse model was required. The HSALR mouse model is an established model for DM1
  (Mankodi, A. et al. Science. 289: 1769, 2000). The mice carry a human skeletal actin (hACTA1)
  transgene with 220 CTG repeats inserted in the 3' UTR of the gene. The hACTAl-CUGexp
  transcript accumulates in nuclear foci in skeletal muscles and results in myotonia similar to that in
  human DM1 (Mankodi, A. et al. Mol. Cell 10: 35, 2002; Lin, X. et al. Hum. Mol. Genet. 15:
  2087, 2006). Hence, it was expected that amelioration of DM1 symptoms in the HSALR mouse by
  antisense inhibition of the hACTA1 transgene would predict amelioration of similar symptoms in
  human patients by antisense inhibition of the DMPK transcript.
          HSA (human skeletal actin)    LR (long repeat) DM1 mice were generated by insertion in
5 FVB/N mice of a transgene with 250 CUG repeats in the 3' UTR of human skeletal actin. The
  transgene is expressed in the mice as a CUG repeat RNA, which is retained in the nucleus, forming
  nuclear inclusions or foci, similar to that seen in human tissue samples of patients with myotonic
  dystrophy (DM1).

  inhibition in vitro (see Example 11), were evaluated for their ability to reduce human alphal actin
  RNA transcript in vivo.
  Treatment
           HSALR mice were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum normal Purina
  mouse chow. Animals were acclimated for at least 7 days in the research facility before initiation of
  the experiment. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were prepared in PBS and sterilized by filtering
  through a 0.2 micron filter. Oligonucleotides were dissolved in 0.9% PBS for injection.
           The mice were divided into two treatment groups. The two groups received direct
  intramuscular injections of ISIS 190403 or ISIS 445238 at a dose of 0.8 nM into the tibialis anterior
  muscle on one side. The contralateral tibialis anterior muscle in each mouse received a single dose
  intramuscular injection of PBS. The PBS-injected muscle acted as the control.
  Inhibition of alpha] actin RNA
           Twenty four hours after the final dose, the animals were sacrificed and tissue from the
  tibialis anterior miUscles of both sides was isolated. RNA was isolated for real-time PCR airalysis of
  alphal actin and normalized to 18s RNA. As presented in Table 20, treatment with antisense
  oligonucleotides reduced human alphal actin RNA transcript expression. The results are expressed
  as percent inhibition of alphal actin transcript, relative to the PBS control.

  Assessment of myotonia by electromyography
           Myotonia refers to repetitive action potential that is due to delayed relaxation of muscle
  fibers. This phenomenon is observed in patients of myotonic dystrophy as well as in the HSALR
  mice. When the EMG needle is inserted into a myotonic muscle, the electrical activity is prolonged
5 for up to several seconds past when the insertional activity should normally cease. The frequency of
  myotonic discharges ranges from 50 to 100 impulses per second.

        Myotonia was measured via electromyography and graded in the following manner: grade 0
refers to no myotonia elicited by any needle insertion (0%); grade 1 refers to myotonia elicited by
less than 50% needle insertions; grade 2 refers to myotonia elicited by more than 50% needle
insertions; and grade 3 refers to mytonia elicited by 100% needle insertions.
        Before electromyography, mice were anesthetized by using i.p. a cocktail of 100 mg/kg
ketamine, 10 mg/kg xylazine, and 3 mg/kg acepromazine. Electromyography on left and right
quadriceps, left and right gastrocnemius muscles, left and right tibialis anterior muscles and lumbar
paraspinals muscles was performed as previously described (Kanadia et al, 2003, Science, 302:
1978-1980) by using 30 gauge concentric needle electrodes and a minimum of 10 needle insertions
for each muscle. The data is presented in Table 22 as the average myotonia grade observed in four
mice of each group and demonstrates significant reduction of myotonia in mice treated with ISIS
445236.

Correctionof alternativesplicing
        In DM1 / HSALR mouse model, the accumulation of expanded CUG RNA in the nucleus
leads to the sequestration of poly(CUG)-binding proteins, such as Muscleblind-like 1 (MBLN1)
(Miller, J.W. et al. EMBO J. 19: 4439, 2000). The splicing factor MBNL1, which controls
alternative splicing of the Sercal gene is sequestered in expanded CUG foci. This triggers
dysregulation of the alternative splicing of this gene. To evaluate the effect of antisense inhibition
of human alpha 1 actin on such alternative splicing, total RNA was purified from the tibialis
anterior, gastrocnemius, and quadriceps muscle using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen),
according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed with the SuperScript III One
Step RT-PCR System and Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen), using gene-specific primers for
cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification. The forward and reverse primers for Serca-1 have been
described in Bennett and Swayze (Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. 2010; 50: 259-93). PCR products were
                                                    108

 separated on agarose gels, stained with SybrGreen I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Invitrogen), and
imaged using a Fujifilm LAS-3000 Intelligent Dark Box.
         The PCR products of Sercal splicing in the PBS control demonstrated exon 22 exclusion as
a result of dysregulation of MBLN1. Treatment with ISIS 445236 resulted in exon 22 inclusion and
normalization of alternative splicing of the Sercal gene in the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and
quadriceps muscles.
        Therefore, antisense inhibition of alphal actin corrected Sercal splicing dysregulation,
which indicates that treatment with antisense oligonucleotide reduced accumulation of CUGexp in
the nuclear foci. Reduced accumulation of CUGexp in the nuclear foci corrects MBLN1
sequestration thereby allowing normal splicing to occur.

through a 0.2 micron filter. Oligonucleotides were dissolved in 0.9% PBS for injection.
        The mice were divided into four treatment groups. The first three groups received
subcutaneous injections of ISIS 190403, ISIS 445236 or ISIS 445238 at a dose of 25 mg/kg twice
per week for 4 weeks. The fourth group received subcutaneous injections of PBS twice weekly for
4 weeks. The PBS-injected group served as the control group to which the oligonucleotide-treated

5 Correctionof alternative splicing
          The splicing factor MBNL1, which controls Sercal splicing, m-Titin splicing, CIC-1
  chloride channel gene (Clcnl) splicing, and Zasp splicing, is sequestered in expanded CUG foci.
  MBNL1 sequestration triggers dysregulated splicing in each of these genes. To evaluate the effect
  of antisense inhibition of human alpha 1 actin on splicing, total RNA was purified from the tibialis
3 anterior, gastrocnemius, and quadriceps muscle and RT-PCR was performed, as described in
  Example 13. The forward and reverse primers for Serca-1, m-Titin, Clcn1, and ZASP have been
  described in Bennett and Swayze, Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. 2010; 50: 259-93.
          In PBS treated HSALR mice, Sercal splicing is dysregulated as demonstrated by exon 22
  exclusion. Treatment with each of ISIS 445236 and ISIS 445238 resulted in exon 22 inclusion and
                                                      111

       WO 2012/012443                                                           PCT/US2011/044555
  normalization of alternative splicing of the Sercal gene in the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and
  quadriceps muscles.
          In PBS treated HSALR mice, m-Titin splicing is dysregulated as demonstrated by exon 5
  inclusion. Treatment with each of ISIS 445236 and ISIS 445238 resulted in skipping of exon 5 and
  normalization of alternative splicing of the m-Titin gene in the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and
  quadriceps muscles.
          In PBS treated HSALR mice, Clcn1 splicing is dysregulated as demonstrated by exon 7a
  inclusion. Treatment with each of ISIS 445236 and ISIS 445238 resulted in skipping of exon 7a and
  normalization of alternative splicing of the Clcnl gene in the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and
  quadriceps muscles.
          In PBS treated HSALR mice, Zasp splicing is dysregulated as demonstrated by exon 11
  inclusion. Treatment with each of ISIS 445236 and ISIS 445238 resulted in skipping of exon 11 and
  normalization of alternative splicing of the Zasp gene in the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and
  quadriceps muscles.
          Therefore, antisense inhibition of alphal actin corrected Sercal, m-Titin, Clcnl, and Zasp
  splicing dysregulation, which indicates that treatment with antisense oligonucleotide reduced
  accumulation of CUGexp in the nuclear foci. Reduced accumulation of CUGexp in the nuclear foci
  correct MBLN1 sequestration thereby allowing normal splicing to occur.

)          Antisense inhibition of human alphal actin RNA transcript by ISIS 445236 and ISIS 445238
  on myotonia in HSALR mice was further evaluated.
  Treatment
          HSALR mice were divided into three treatment groups. The first two groups received
  subcutaneous injections of ISIS 445236 or ISIS 445238 at a dose of 25 mg/kg twice per week for 2
  weeks. The third group received subcutaneous injections of PBS twice per week for 2 weeks. The
  PBS-injected group served as the control group to which the oligonucleotide-treated group was
  compared.

  Inhibition of alpha] actin RNA
          Twenty four hours after the final dose, the animals were sacrificed and tissue from the
  quadriceps muscles, gastrocnemius muscles, and tibialis anterior muscles was isolated. RNA was
  isolated for real-time PCR analysis of alphal actin and normalized to 18s RNA. As presented in
  Table 25, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides reduced human alphal actin RNA transcript
  expression. The results are expressed as percent inhibition of alphal actin transcript, relative to the
  PBS control.
          Both ISIS 445236 and ISIS 445238 demonstrated significant inhibition of alphal actin
  mRNA levels under the conditions specified above.

          Electromyography on left and right quadriceps, left and right gastrocnemius muscles, left

  electrodes and a minimum of 10 needle insertions for each muscle. The data is presented in Table

   Correctionof alternative splicing
           To evaluate the effect of ISIS 190401 on alternative splicing of Serca1, total RNA purified
   from the tibialis anterior gastrocnemius, and quadriceps muscle was analyzed in a procedure similar
  to that described in Example 13.
           In PBS treated HSALR mice, Sercal splicing is dysregulated as demonstrated by exon 22
  exclusion, as a result of MBLN1 dysregulation. Treatment with each of ISIS 445236 and ISIS
  445238 resulted in near-complete inclusion and normalization of alternative splicing of exon 22 of
  the Sercal gene in the tibialis anterior and quadriceps muscles.
          Therefore, antisense inhibition of alphal actin corrected Sercal splicing dysregulation,
  which indicates that treatment with antisense oligonucleotide reduced accumulation of CUGexp in
  the nuclear foci. Reduced accumulation of CUGexp in the nuclear foci correct MBLN1
  sequestration thereby allowing normal splicing to occur.
  Example 16: Dose-dependent antisense inhibition of human alphal actin in transgenic mice
            Dose-dependent inhibition of human alphal actin RNA transcript by ISIS 445236 and ISIS
  445238 on myotonia in HSA Lk mice was evaluated.
  Treatment
          HSALR mice were subcutaneously injected with ISIS 445236 or ISIS 445238 at doses of 2.5
  mg/kg, 8.5 mg/kg or 25.0 mg/kg twice per week for 4 weeks. The control group received
  subcutaneous injections of PBS twice per week for 4 weeks. The PBS-injected group served as the
0 control group to which the oligonucleotide-treated group was compared.
  Inhibition of alpha] actin RNA
          Twenty four hours after the final dose, the animals were sacrificed and tissue from the
  quadriceps muscles (Quad), gastrocnemius muscles (Gastroc), and tibialis anterior muscles (TA)

5 RNA. As presented in Table 27, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides reduced human alphal
  actin RNA transcript expression. The results are expressed as percent inhibition of alphal actin
  transcript, relative to the PBS control.

          In PBS treated HSALR mice, Sercal splicing is dysregulated as demonstrated by exon 22
  exclusion, as a result of MBLN1 dysregulation. Treatment with ISIS 190401 resulted in complete
  inclusion and normalization of alternative splicing of exon 22 of the Sercal gene in all three muscle
  types.
          Therefore, antisense inhibition of alphal actin corrected Sercal splicing dysregulation,
  which indicates that treatment with antisense oligonucleotide reduced accumulation of CUGexp in
  the nuclear foci. Reduced accumulation of CUGexp in the nuclear foci corrects MBLN1
  sequestration thereby allowing normal splicing to occur.
  Example 18: Duration of action of antisense inhibition by an oligonucleotide targeting human
  alphal actin in transgenic mice
            The duration of action of antisense inhibition of human alphal actin RNA transcript by ISIS
  445236 in HSALR mice was evaluated.
  Treatment
          HSALR mice received subcutaneous injections of ISIS 445236 at a dose of 25 mg/kg twice
  per week for 4 weeks. A control group received subcutaneous injections of PBS twice per week for
  2 weeks. The PBS-injected group served as the control group to which the oligonucleotide-treated
  group was compared. The mice were analyzed 6 weeks after administration of the last dose.
  Inhibition of alpha] actin RNA
          Six weeks after the final dose, the animals were sacrificed and tissue from the quadriceps
0 muscles, gastrocnemius muscles, and tibialis anterior muscles was isolated. RNA was isolated for
  real-time PCR analysis of alphal actin and normalized to 18s RNA. As presented in Table 31,
  treatment with ISIS 445236 reduced human alphal actin RNA transcript expression, and this effect
  was sustained at least for 6 weeks. The results are expressed as percent inhibition of alphal actin
  transcript, relative to the PBS control.
5         Treatment with ISIS 445236 resulted in significant inhibition of alphal actin mRNA levels
  in quadriceps muscle, gastrocnemius muscle, and tibialis anterior muscle under the conditions
  specified above.

  Example 23: In vivo antisense inhibition of human DMPK in transgenic mice
          LC15 mice, Line A, are transgenic mice containing the entire human DMPK 3'UTR
  (developed by Wheeler et al, University of Rochester). The mice are the second generation of mice

  backcrossed to an FVB background. The transgene is expressed in the mice as a CUG repeat RNA,
  which is retained in the nucleus, forming nuclear inclusions or foci, similar to that seen in human
  tissue samples of patients with myotonic dystrophy (DM1). There are 350-400 CUG repeats in the
  DMPK transgene. These mice display early signs of DM1 and do not display any myotonia in their
  muscle tissues.
  ISIS 445569, ISIS 444404, ISIS 444436 and ISIS 473810, which demonstrated statistically
  significant dose-dependent inhibition in vitro (see Example 5), were evaluated for their ability to
  reduce human DMPK RNA transcript in vivo.
  Treatment
           LC15, Line A mice were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum normal
  Purina mouse chow. Animals were acclimated for at least 7 days in the research facility before
  initiation of the experiment. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were prepared in PBS and
  sterilized by filtering through a 0.2 micron filter. Oligonucleotides were dissolved in 0.9% PBS for
  injection.
           The mice were divided into five treatment groups. The first three groups received
  subcutaneous injections of ISIS 445569, ISIS 444404 or ISIS 444436 at a dose of 25 mg/kg twice
  per week for 4 weeks. The fourth group received subcutaneous injections of ISIS 473810 at a dose
  of 12.5 mg/kg twice per week for 4 weeks. The fifth group received subcutaneous injections of PBS
  twice weekly for 4 weeks. The PBS-injected group served as the control group to which the
  oligonucleotide-treated group was compared.
  Inhibition ofDMPK RNA
           Twenty four hours after the final dose, the animals were sacrificed and tissue from the
  quadriceps muscles was isolated. RNA was isolated for real-time PCR analysis of DMPK and
  normalized to 18s RNA. As presented in Table 38, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides
5 reduced human DMPK RNA transcript expression. The results are expressed as percent inhibition
  of DMPK transcript, relative to the PBS control.

Assessment of myotonia by electromyography
         Electromyography on left and right quadriceps, left and right gastrocnemius muscles, left
and right tibialis anterior muscles and lumbar paraspinals muscles was performed as previously
described (Kanadia et al, 2003, Science, 302: 1978-1980) by using 30 gauge concentric needle
electrodes and a minimum of 10 needle insertions for each muscle. Since LC15 mice do not have
myotonia, neither the control group nor the treatment groups displayed any myotonia in any muscle
tested.
Example 24: In vivo antisense inhibition of human DMPK in transgenic mice
          LC15 mice, Line D, are transgenic mice containing the entire human DMPK 3'UTR
(developed by Wheeler et al, University of Rochester). The mice are the third generation of mice
backcrossed to an FVB background. The transgene is expressed in the mice as a CUG repeat RNA,
which is retained in the nucleus, forming nuclear inclusions or foci, similar to that seen in human
tissue samples of patients with myotonic dystrophy (DM1). There are 350-400 CUG repeats in the
DMPK transgene. These mice display early signs of DM1 and do not display any myotonia in their
muscle tissues.
         ISIS 445569, ISIS 444404, ISIS 444436 and ISIS 473810 were further evaluated for their
ability to reduce human DMPK RNA transcript in vivo.
Treatment
         LC15, Line D mice were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum normal
Purina mouse chow. Animals were acclimated for at least 7 days in the research facility before
initiation of the experiment. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were prepared in PBS and
sterilized by filtering through a 0.2 micron filter. Oligonucleotides were dissolved in 0.9% PBS for
injection.
         The mice were divided into six treatment groups. The first three groups received
subcutaneous injections of ISIS 445569, ISIS 444404 or ISIS 444436 at a dose of 25.00 mg/kg twice
per week for 4 weeks. The fourth group received subcutaneous injections of ISIS 473810 at a dose
                                                    125

   of 12.50 mg/kg twice per week for 4 weeks. The fifth group received subcutaneous injections of
  ISIS 473810 at a dose of 6.25 mg/kg twice per week for 4 weeks. The sixth group received
   subcutaneous injections of PBS twice weekly for 4 weeks. The PBS-injected group served as the
  control group to which the oligonucleotide-treated group was compared.
  Inhibition of DMPK RNA
          Twenty four hours after the final dose, the animals were sacrificed and tissue from the
  quadriceps muscles was isolated. RNA was isolated for real-time PCR analysis of DMPK and
  normalized to 18s RNA. As presented in Table 39, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides
  reduced human DMPK RNA transcript expression. The results are expressed as percent inhibition
  of DMPK transcript, relative to the PBS control.
          The results indicate that treatment with the antisense oligonucleotides resulted in inhibition
  of DMPK mRNA in the mice.

  Assessment of myotonia by electromyography
          Electromyography on left and right quadriceps, left and right gastrocnemius muscles, left

  Example 25: In vivo antisense inhibition of human DMPK in SXL transgenic mouse model
          Using hDMPK-targeting ASOs 444401 and 299471 target knockdown in soleus muscle was

  contains a 1000 CUG repeat sequence in the 3'UTR of DMPK gene. Mice were dosed 50mg/kg
  twice weekly for 4 weeks (n= 3 mice per group, except n=2 for saline-injected controls). Results of
  Taqman assays demonstrated that treatment with either ISISI 444401 or ISIS 299471 significantly
  reduced mut-hDMPK mRNA levels but had negligible effect on endogenous mouse Dmpk mRNA
  levels.
          Therefore, ISIS 444401 and ISIS 299471 selectively target human DMPK mRNA transcript.
  Example 26: Duration of action of antisense inhibition by an oligonucleotide targeting human
  alphal actin in transgenic mice
            The duration of action of antisense inhibition of human alphal actin RNA transcript by ISIS
  190401 in HSALR mice was evaluated.
  Treatment
          HSALR mice received subcutaneous injections of ISIS 190401 at a dose of 25 mg/kg twice
  per week for 4 weeks. A control group received subcutaneous injections of PBS twice per week for
  4 weeks. The PBS-injected group served as the control group to which the oligonucleotide-treated
  group was compared. The mice were analyzed 15 weeks after administration of the last dose.
  Inhibition of alphal actin RNA
          Fifteen weeks after the final dose, the animals were sacrificed and tissue from the quadriceps
  muscles, gastrocnemius muscles, and tibialis anterior muscles was isolated. RNA was isolated for
  real-time PCR analysis of alphal actin and normalized to 18s RNA. As presented in Table 40,
D treatment with ISIS 190401 reduced human alphal actin RNA transcript expression, and this effect
  was sustained at least for 15 weeks. The results are expressed as percent inhibition of alphal actin
  transcript, relative to the PBS control.
          Treatment with ISIS 190401 resulted in significant inhibition of alphal actin mRNA levels
  under the conditions specified above.

  Correctionof alternative splicing
5          To evaluate the effect of ISIS 190401 on alternative splicing of Sercal, total RNA purified
  from the tibialis anterior gastrocnemius, and quadriceps muscle was analyzed in a procedure similar
  to that described in Example 13.
           In PBS treated HSALR mice, Sercal splicing is dysregulated as demonstrated by exon 22
  exclusion. Treatment with ISIS 190401 resulted in complete inclusion and normalization of
) alternative splicing of exon 22 of the Sercal gene in all three muscle types, which was sustained
  even after 15 weeks.
          Therefore, antisense inhibition of alphal actin corrected Sercal splicing dysregulation,
  which indicates that treatment with antisense oligonucleotide reduced accumulation of CUGexp in
                                                        128

   the nuclear foci. Reduced accumulation of CUGexp in the nuclear foci corrects MBLN1
   sequestration thereby allowing normal splicing to occur.
   Example 27: Microarray analysis of transcriptomic effect of antisense inhibition of human actin
           Expression of actin mRNA with expanded CUG repeats causes extensive remodeling of the
   muscle transcriptome. To evaluate the overall transcriptomic effects of ISIS 190401 and ISIS
   445236, microarray analyses was utilized in HSALR mice.
   Treatment
           HSALR mice received subcutaneous injections of ISIS 190401 or ISIS 445236 at a dose of 25
  mg/kg twice per week for 4 weeks. A control group received subcutaneous injections of PBS twice
  per week for 4 weeks. The PBS-injected group served as the control group to which the
  oligonucleotide-treated group was compared.
   Transcriptomeanalysis by microarray
           RNA was isolated from the quadriceps muscle of wild-type or HSALR mice. RNA integrity
  was verified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (RNA integrity number > 7.5). RNA was processed to
  complementary RNA (cRNA) and hybridized on microbeads using MouseRef-8 v2.0 Expression
  BeadChip Kits (Illumina, San Diego), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Image
  data were quantified using BeadStudio software (Illumina). Signal intensities were quantile
  normalized. Row-specific offsets were used to avoid any values of less than 2 prior to
  normalization. Data from all probe sets with 6 or more nucleotides of CUG, UGC, or GCU repeats
D was suppressed to eliminate the possibility that expanded repeats in the hybridization mixture (CAG
  repeats in cRNA originating from CUG repeats in the mRNA) could cross-hybridize with repeat
  sequences in the probes. To eliminate genes whose expression was not readily quantified on the
  arrays, probes showing a P value for detection probability of<0.1 were suppressed in all samples.
  Comparisons between groups were summarized and rank-ordered by fold-changes of mean
  expression level and t tests. The software package R (Butler et al. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1028-34)
  was used to perform principal components analysis (Levin et al. In Antisense Drug Technology:
  Principles,Strategies, andApplications, S.T. Crooke, Ed. (CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2008), pp 183
  215; Geary et al. DrugMetab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 1419-28) on wild-type, ISIS oligonucleotide
  treated, and PBS-treated microarray samples. The principle components allowed the capture of the
                                                    129

      WO 2012/012443                                                                PCT/US2011/044555
 majority of the expression variation in each sample within 3 dimensions. The first three principal
 components of each sample were plotted.
          The principle component analysis of untreated wild-type and HSALR mice demonstrated
 segregation of HSALR away from wild-type mice, in widely separated clusters. In contrast,
 antisense oligonucleotide-treated HSALR mice clustered more closely to wild-type mice, suggesting
an overall trend for transcriptome normalization. Comparisons of HSALR transgenic mice with
wild-type mice identified 93 transcripts whose expression levels were altered more than two-fold
(P< 0.0001), as presented in Table 42, below. The extent of dysregulation for these transcripts was
reduced or normalized for antisense oligonucleotides (88% dysregulated transcripts responded to
ISIS 445236, P< 0.05 for ISIS 445236 vs. PBS control, whereas 90% responded to ISIS 190401).
          In order to consider transcripts that have off-target knockdown, all transcripts whose
expression was reduced in antisense oligonucleotide-treated HSALR mice were identified (> two
fold reduction by either oligonucleotide, P< 0.000 1, n = 41 transcripts). All transcripts that were
down-regulated by these criteria demonstrated upregulation in HSALR mice. The only exception,
collagen 6 alpha2,is unlikely to result from off-target cleavage because it was down-regulated by
the two antisense oligonucleotides with non-overlapping sequences.
          These results indicate that treatment with antisense oligonucleotides for 4 weeks resulted in a
general improvement of the muscle transcriptome without any evidence for off-target effects.
