[0001]           This application claims the priority benefit of U.S. provisional application Serial
No. 61/574,406, filed August 1, 2011, the contents of which are incorporated herein by

specification.
                                       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]           The provision of two distinct signals to T-cells is a widely accepted model for
lymphocyte activation of resting T lymphocytes by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Lafferty
et al, Aust. J. Exp. Biol. Med. ScL 53: 27-42 (1975). This model further provides for the
discrimination of self from non-self and immune tolerance. Bretscher et al, Science 169:
 1042-1049 (1970); Bretscher, P.A., P.N.A.S. USA 96: 185-190 (1999); Jenkins et al, J. Exp.
Med. 165: 302-319 (1987). The primary signal, or antigen specific signal, is transduced
through the T- cell receptor (TCR) following recognition of foreign antigen peptide presented
in the context of the major histocompatibility-complex (MHC). The second or co
stimulatory signal is delivered to T-cells by co-stimulatory molecules expressed on antigen
presenting cells (APCs), and induce T-cells to promote clonal expansion, cytokine secretion
and effector function. Lenschow et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol. 14:233 (1996). In the absence of
co-stimulation, T-cells can become refractory to antigen stimulation, do not mount an
effective immune response, and further may result in exhaustion or tolerance to foreign
antigens.
[0004]           In the two-signal model T-cells receive both positive and negative secondary co
stimulatory signals. The regulation of such positive and negative signals is critical to
maximize the host's protective immune responses, while maintaining immune tolerance and
preventing autoimmunity. Negative secondary signals seem necessary for induction of T-cell
tolerance, while positive signals promote T-cell activation. While the simple two-signal
model still provides a valid explanation for naive lymphocytes, a host's immune response is a
                                                      -1
9866665_1 (GHMatters) P93275.AU.2

dynamic process, and co- stimulatory signals can also be provided to antigen-exposed T
cells. The mechanism of co-stimulation is of therapeutic interest because the manipulation of
co-stimulatory signals has shown to provide a means to either enhance or terminate cell
based immune response. Recently, it has been discovered that T cell dysfunction or anergy
occurs concurrently with an induced and sustained expression of the inhibitory receptor,
programmed death 1 polypeptide (PD-1). As a result, therapeutic targeting of PD-i and other
molecules which signal through interactions with PD-1, such as programmed death ligand 1
(PD-Ll) and programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2) are an area of intense interest.
[0005]           PD-Li is overexpressed in many cancers and is often associated with poor
prognosis (Okazaki T et al., Intern. Immun. 2007 19(7):813) (Thompson RH et al., Cancer
Res 2006, 66(7):3381). Interestingly, the majority of tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes
predominantly express PD-1, in contrast to T lymphocytes in normal tissues and peripheral
blood T lymphocytes indicating that up-regulation of PD-i on tumor-reactive T cells can
contribute to impaired antitumor immune responses (Blood 2009 114(8):1537). This may be
due to exploitation of PD-Li signaling mediated by PD-LI expressing tumor cells interacting
with PD-i expressing T cells to result in attenuation of T cell activation and evasion of
immune surveillance (Sharpe et al., Nat Rev 2002) (Keir ME et al., 2008 Annu. Rev.
Immunol. 26:677). Therefore, inhibition of the PD-Li/PD-i interaction may enhance CD8+
T cell-mediated killing of tumors.
[0006]           The inhibition of PD-i axis signaling through its direct ligands (e.g., PD-L1, PD-L2)
has been proposed as a means to enhance T cell immunity for the treatment of cancer (e.g.,
tumor immunity). Moreover, similar enhancements to T cell immunity have been observed
by inhibiting the binding of PD-Li to the binding partner B7-1. Furthermore, combining
inhibition of PD-i signaling with other signaling pathways (e.g. MAPK pathway, "MEK")
that are deregulated in tumor cells may further enhance treatment efficacy. However, an
optimal therapeutic treatment would combine blockade of PD-I receptor/ligand interaction
with an agent that directly inhibited tumor growth, optionally further including unique
immune enhancing properties not provided by PD-I blockade alone. There remains a need
for such an optimal therapy for treating, stabilizing, preventing, and/or delaying development
of various cancers.

treated with MEK inhibitor.
[0022]           Figure 2 is a histogram showing that treatment of human melanoma cell lines (5/8
cell lines of which were BRAF mutant; BRAF wild-type cells indicated with asterisk) with
BRAF inhibitor did not upregulate MHC I surface expression.
[0023]           Figure 3 shows that treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with
MEK inhibitor did not upregulate MHC I surface expression. (A-D) Histogram showing

MEK inhibitor treatment. (A) Graph of CD8+ T cells levels shows that MEK inhibitor
treatment reduced T cell proliferation and activation normally induced by stimulation of
CD3. (B) Graph of CD8+ T cells show that co-stimulation of CD3 and CD28 was sufficient
to overcome the inhibitory effect of MEK inhibitor treatment.

of dendritic cells stimulated with anti-CD40 antibodies. (A-C) Histogram showing dendritic
cells stimulated with anti-CD40 antibodies and treated with MEK or BRAF inhibitor. MEK
inhibitor enhanced DC activation as evidenced by upregulation of DC surface activation
markers CD83, MHC II and CD86. (D-F) Graphs of activated dendritic cell levels
demonstrates that MEK inhibitor enhanced DC activation in a dose dependent manner.
[0026]           Figure 6 is a graph showing reduced serum levels of immunosuppressive and pro

changes in tumor volume with anti-PD-LI antibodies and MEK inhibitor co-treatment
demonstrate a significant reduction of early stage tumor growth and sustained anti-tumor
effect as compared to anti-PD-LI antibodies or MEK inhibitor treatment alone. (B) Graph

[0029]           Figure 9 is a graph demonstrating that treatment with MEK inhibitor G02443714
enhanced the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-Li antibodies in in vivo models of colorectal
cancer. An enhanced reduction in tumor volume with anti-PD-Li antibody and MEK
inhibitor combination treatment was observed as compared to treatment with anti-PD-LI
antibody or MEK inhibitor G02443714 alone.
 [0030]          Figure 10 is a graph demonstrating that treatment with MEK inhibitor G02442104
enhanced the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-LI antibodies in in vivo models of colorectal
cancer. An enhanced reduction in tumor volume with anti-PD-Li antibody and MEK
inhibitor combination treatment was observed as compared to treatment with anti-PD-Li
antibody or MEK inhibitor G02442104 alone.
 [0031]          Figure 11 is a graph demonstrating that treatment with MEK inhibitor G00039805
enhanced the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-Li antibodies in in vivo models of colorectal
cancer. An enhanced reduction in tumor volume with anti-PD-Li antibody and MEK
inhibitor combination treatment was observed as compared to treatment with anti-PD-Li
antibody or MEK inhibitor G00039805 alone.

[0033]           Figure 13 is a graph demonstrating that co-treatment with anti-PD-Li antibodies
and a chemotherapeutic agent Temodar did not reduce tumor growth in an in vivo model of
melanoma. Therefore, the anti-tumor effect of MEK inhibitor and anti-PD-LI antibodies is
specific.
[0034]           Figure 14 is a graph demonstrating that co-treatment with anti-OX40 antibodies
and a MEK inhibitor did not reduce tumor growth in an in vivo colorectal model. Therefore,
the anti-tumor effect of MEK inhibitor and anti-PD-Li antibodies is specific.
[0035]           Figure 15 contains several graphs showing that MEK inhibitor increased activation
of dendritic cells independently of anti-PD-LI antibody treatment. (A) Graph demonstrating
that anti-PD-Li antibody treatment slightly increased MHC I surface expression. MEK
inhibitor treatment significantly enhanced MHCI expression, however co-treatment with anti
PD-LI antibodies did not enhance the effect of MEK inhibitor treatment. (B-D) Graphs
demonstrating that anti-PD-Li antibody treatment did not increase expression of dendritic
cell activation markers MHC II, CD80, and CD86. In contrast MEK inhibitor treatment
significantly enhanced expression of dendritic cell activation markers. Co-treatment with
anti-PD-LI antibodies did not enhance the effect of MEK inhibitor treatment. (E-H) Graphs

I.           Definitions
 [0037]          In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the
context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word
''comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition
of further features in various embodiments of the invention.
 [0038]          The term "PD-1 axis binding antagonist"is a molecule that inhibits the interaction
of a PD-I axis binding partner with either one or more of its binding partner, so as to remove
T-cell dysfunction resulting from signaling on the PD-I signaling axis - with a result being to
restore or enhance T-cell function (e.g., proliferation, cytokine production, target cell killing).
As used herein, a PD-I axis binding antagonist includes a PD-I binding antagonist, a PD-LI
binding antagonist and a PD-L2 binding antagonist.
[0039]           The term "PD-1 binding antagonists" is a molecule that decreases, blocks, inhibits,
abrogates or interferes with signal transduction resulting from the interaction of PD-1 with
one or more of its binding partners, such as PD-Li, PD-L2. In some embodiments, the PD-1
binding antagonist is a molecule that inhibits the binding of PD-I to its binding partners. In a
specific aspect, the PD-1 binding antagonist inhibits the binding of PD-1 to PD-Li and/or
PD-L2. For example, PD-1 binding antagonists include anti-PD-i antibodies, antigen
binding fragments thereof, immunoadhesins, fusion proteins, oligopeptides and other
molecules that decrease, block, inhibit, abrogate or interfere with signal transduction

resulting from the interaction of PD-i with PD-Li and/or PD-L2. In one embodiment, a PD
 1 binding antagonist reduces the negative co-stimulatory signal mediated by or through cell
surface proteins expressed on T lymphocytes mediated signaling through PD-I so as render a
dysfunctional T-cell less dysfunctional (e.g., enhancing effector responses to antigen
recognition). In some embodiments, the PD-i binding antagonist is an anti-PD-i antibody.
In a specific aspect, a PD-I binding antagonist is MDX- 1i06 described herein. In another
specific aspect, a PD-i binding antagonist is Merck 3745 described herein. In another
specific aspect, a PD-I binding antagonist is CT-01I described herein.
 [0040]          The term "PD-Li binding antagonists"is a molecule that decreases, blocks, inhibits,
abrogates or interferes with signal transduction resulting from the interaction of PD-Li with
either one or more of its binding partners, such as PD-1, B7-1. In some embodiments, a PD
LI binding antagonist is a molecule that inhibits the binding of PD-LI to its binding partners.
In a specific aspect, the PD-Li binding antagonist inhibits binding of PD-Li to PD-i and/or
B7-1. In some embodiments, the PD-Li binding antagonists include anti-PD-Li antibodies,

(e.g., enhancing effector responses to antigen recognition). In some embodiments, a PD-Li
binding antagonist is an anti-PD-Li antibody. In a specific aspect, an anti-PD-Li antibody is
YW243.55.S70 described herein. In another specific aspect, an anti-PD-Li antibody is
MDX- 1105 described herein. In still another specific aspect, an anti-PD-LI antibody is
MPDL3280A described herein.
[0041]           The term "PD-L2 binding antagonists"is a molecule that decreases, blocks, inhibits,
abrogates or interferes with signal transduction resulting from the interaction of PD-L2 with
either one or more of its binding partners, such as PD-1. In some embodiments, a PD-L2
binding antagonist is a molecule that inhibits the binding of PD-L2 to its binding partners. In
a specific aspect, the PD-L2 binding antagonist inhibits binding of PD-L2 to PD-1. In some
embodiments, the PD-L2 antagonists include anti-PD-L2 antibodies, antigen binding
fragments thereof, immunoadhesins, fusion proteins, oligopeptides and other molecules that
decrease, block, inhibit, abrogate or interfere with signal transduction resulting from the
                                                -10

interaction of PD-L2 with either one or more of its binding partners, such as PD-1. In one
embodiment, a PD-L2 binding antagonist reduces the negative co-stimulatory signal
mediated by or through cell surface proteins expressed on T lymphocytes mediated signaling
through PD-L2 so as render a dysfunctional T-cell less dysfunctional (e.g., enhancing
effector responses to antigen recognition). In some embodiments, a PD-L2 binding
antagonist is an immunoadhesin.
 [0042]          The term "dysfunction" in the context of immune dysfunction, refers to a state of
reduced immune responsiveness to antigenic stimulation. The term includes the common
elements of both exhaustion and/or anergy in which antigen recognition may occur, but the
ensuing immune response is ineffective to control infection or tumor growth.
 [0043]          The term "dysfunctional", as used herein, also includes refractory or unresponsive
to antigen recognition, specifically, impaired capacity to translate antigen recognition into
down-stream T-cell effector functions, such as proliferation, cytokine production (e.g., IL-2)
and/or target cell killing.
[0044]           The term "anergy" refers to the state of unresponsiveness to antigen stimulation
resulting from incomplete or insufficient signals delivered through the T-cell receptor (e.g.
increase in intracellular Ca+2 in the absence of ras-activation). T cell anergy can also result
upon stimulation with antigen in the absence of co-stimulation, resulting in the cell becoming
refractory to subsequent activation by the antigen even in the context of costimulation. The
unresponsive state can often be overriden by the presence of Interleukin-2. Anergic T-cells
do not undergo clonal expansion and/or acquire effector functions.
[0045]           The term "exhaustion" refers to T cell exhaustion as a state of T cell dysfunction
that arises from sustained TCR signaling that occurs during many chronic infections and
cancer. It is distinguished from anergy in that it arises not through incomplete or deficient
signaling, but from sustained signaling. It is defined by poor effector function, sustained
expression of inhibitory receptors and a transcriptional state distinct from that of functional
effector or memory T cells. Exhaustion prevents optimal control of infection and tumors.
Exhaustion can result from both extrinsic negative regulatory pathways (e.g.,
immunoregulatory cytokines) as well as cell intrinsic negative regulatory (costimulatory)
pathways (PD-1, B7-H3, B7-H4, etc.).
[0046]           "EnhancingT-cellfunction " means to induce, cause or stimulate a T-cell to have a
sustained or amplified biological function, or renew or reactivate exhausted or inactive T
cells. Examples of enhancing T-cell function include: increased secretion of y-interferon
                                                     -11
9866665_1 (GHMatters) P93275.AU.2

from CD8+ T-cells, increased proliferation, increased antigen responsiveness (e.g., viral,
pathogen, or tumor clearance) relative to such levels before the intervention. In one
embodiment, the level of enhancement is as least 50%, alternatively 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%,
 100%, 120%, 150%, 200%. The manner of measuring this enhancement is known to one of
ordinary skill in the art.
[0047]           A "T cell dysfunctional disorder"is a disorder or condition of T-cells characterized
by decreased responsiveness to antigenic stimulation. In a particular embodiment, a T-cell
dysfunctional disorder is a disorder that is specifically associated with inappropriate
increased signaling through PD-1. In another embodiment, a T-cell dysfunctional disorder is
one in which T-cells are anergic or have decreased ability to secrete cytokines, proliferate, or
execute cytolytic activity. In a specific aspect, the decreased responsiveness results in
ineffective control of a pathogen or tumor expressing an immunogen. Examples of T cell
dysfunctional disorders characterized by T-cell dysfunction include unresolved acute
infection, chronic infection and tumor immunity.
 [0048]            "Tumor immunity" refers to the process in which tumors evade immune
recognition and clearance. Thus, as a therapeutic concept, tumor immunity is "treated" when
such evasion is attenuated, and the tumors are recognized and attacked by the immune
system. Examples of tumor recognition include tumor binding, tumor shrinkage and tumor
clearance.
 [0049]           "Immunogenecity " refers to the ability of a particular substance to provoke an
immune response. Tumors are immunogenic and enhancing tumor immunogenicity aids in
the clearance of the tumor cells by the immune response. Examples of enhancing tumor
immunogenicity include treatment with anti-PDL antibodies and a MEK inhibitor.
[0050]           "Sustained response" refers to the sustained effect on reducing tumor growth after
cessation of a treatment. For example, the tumor size may remain to be the same or smaller
as compared to the size at the beginning of the administration phase. In some embodiments,
the sustained response has a duration at least the same as the treatment duration, at least 1.5X,
2.OX, 2.5X, or 3.OX length of the treatment duration.
[0051]           The term "antibody" includes monoclonal antibodies (including full length
antibodies which have an immunoglobulin Fc region), antibody compositions with
polyepitopic specificity, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies, diabodies, and
single-chain molecules, as well as antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, F(ab') 2 , and Fv). The term
"immunoglobulin" (Ig) is used interchangeably with "antibody" herein.

[0052]           The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two
identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. An IgM antibody consists of 5
of the basic heterotetramer units along with an additional polypeptide called a J chain, and
contains 10 antigen binding sites, while IgA antibodies comprise from 2-5 of the basic 4
chain units which can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages in combination with the J
chain. In the case of IgGs, the 4-chain unit is generally about 150,000 daltons. Each L chain
is linked to an H chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the two H chains are linked to
each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L
chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N
terminus, a variable domain (VH) followed by three constant domains (CH) for each of the c
and y chains and four CH domains for p and c isotypes. Each L chain has at the N-terminus, a
variable domain (VL) followed by a constant domain at its other end. The VL is aligned with
the VH and the CL is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain (CHIA)
Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and
heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a VH and VL together forms a single antigen
binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, see e.g.,
Basic and ClinicalImmunology, 8th Edition, Daniel P. Sties, Abba I. Terr and Tristram G.
Parsolw (eds), Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT, 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6. The L chain
from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa
and lambda, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the
amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains (CH), immunoglobulins
can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins:
IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, having heavy chains designated c, 6, c, y and p, respectively.
The y and c classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor
differences in the CH sequence and function, e.g., humans express the following subclasses:
IgGI, IgG2A, IgG2B, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2.
[0053]           The "variable region" or "variabledomain" of an antibody refers to the amino
terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domains of the
heavy chain and light chain may be referred to as "VI" and "VL", respectively. These
domains are generally the most variable parts of the antibody (relative to other antibodies of
the same class) and contain the antigen binding sites.
                                                     -13

[0054]           The term "variable"refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains
differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates antigen binding
and defines the specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the
variability is not evenly distributed across the entire span of the variable domains. Instead, it
is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain
and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable
domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and
light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration,
connected by three HVRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of,
the beta-sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the
FR regions and, with the HVRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the
antigen binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., Sequences ofImmunological Interest,
Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991)). The constant domains are
not involved directly in the binding of antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector
functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.
[0055]           The term "monoclonalantibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from
a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies
comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations
and/or post-translation modifications (e.g., isomerizations, amidations) that may be present in
minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single
antigenic site. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include
different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal
antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their
specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the
hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier "monoclonal"
indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous
population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody
by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance
with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example,
the hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler and Milstein., Nature, 256:495-97 (1975); Hongo et al.,
Hybridoma, 14 (3): 253-260 (1995), Harlow et al., Antibodies: A LaboratoryManual, (Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2"d ed. 1988); Hammerling et al., in: MonoclonalAntibodies
and T-Cell Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981)), recombinant DNA methods (see,

 [0056]          The term "naked antibody" refers to an antibody that is not conjugated to a
cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.
[0057]           The terms "full-length antibody," "intact antibody" or "whole antibody" are used
interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form, as opposed to an
antibody fragment. Specifically whole antibodies include those with heavy and light chains
including an Fc region. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains
(e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variants thereof. In
some cases, the intact antibody may have one or more effector functions.
[0058]           An "antibodyfragment" comprises a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the
antigen binding and/or the variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody
fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2 and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies (see U.S.
Patent 5,641,870, Example 2; Zapata et al., Protein Eng. 8(10): 1057-1062 [1995]); single
chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.
Papain digestion of antibodies produced two identical antigen-binding fragments, called
"Fab" fragments, and a residual "Fc" fragment, a designation reflecting the ability to
crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable
region domain of the H chain (VH), and the first constant domain of one heavy chain (CHI).
Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen
binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(ab') 2 fragment which
                                                    -15
9866665_1 (GHMatters) P93275.AU.2

roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having different antigen-binding
activity and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. Fab' fragments differ from Fab
fragments by having a few additional residues at the carboxy terminus of the CH 1 domain
including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation
herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol
group. F(ab') 2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which
have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also
known.
[0059]           The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy-terminal portions of both H chains held
together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in
the Fc region, the region which is also recognized by Fc receptors (FcR) found on certain
types of cells.
[0060]           "Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen
recognition and -binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light
chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association. From the folding of these
two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the H and L chain) that
contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity
to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only
three HVRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at
a lower affinity than the entire binding site.
[0061]            "Single-chainFv " also abbreviated as "sFv " or "scFv " are antibody fragments that
comprise the VH and VL antibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain.
Preferably, the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and
VL domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a
review of the sFv, see Pluckthun in The PharmacologyofMonoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113,
Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).
[0062]           "Functionalfragments"of the antibodies of the invention comprise a portion of an
intact antibody, generally including the antigen binding or variable region of the intact
antibody or the Fc region of an antibody which retains or has modified FcR binding
capability. Examples of antibody fragments include linear antibody, single-chain antibody
molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.
[0063]           The term "diabodies" refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing
sFv fragments (see preceding paragraph) with short linkers (about 5-10) residues) between
                                                    -16
9866665_1 (GHMatters) P93275.AU.2

the VH and VL domains such that inter-chain but not intra-chain pairing of the V domains is
achieved, thereby resulting in a bivalent fragment, i.e., a fragment having two antigen
binding sites. Bispecific diabodies are heterodimers of two "crossover" sFv fragments in
which the VH and VL domains of the two antibodies are present on different polypeptide
chains. Diabodies are described in greater detail in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161;
Hollinger et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448 (1993).
[0064]           The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies
(immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or
homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or
belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s)
is(are) identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from
another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of
such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Patent No.
4,816,567; Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 8:6851-6855 (1984)). Chimeric
antibodies of interest herein include PRIMATIZED* antibodies wherein the antigen-binding
region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by, e.g., immunizing macaque
monkeys with an antigen of interest. As used herein, "humanized antibody" is used a subset
of "chimeric antibodies."
[0065]           "Humanized"forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies
that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In one
embodiment, a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin (recipient antibody) in
which residues from an HVR (hereinafter defined) of the recipient are replaced by residues
from an HVR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non
human primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and/or capacity. In some instances,
framework ("FR") residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding
non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not
found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made
to further refine antibody performance, such as binding affinity. In general, a humanized
antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains,
in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non
human immunoglobulin sequence, and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a
human immunoglobulin sequence, although the FR regions may include one or more
individual FR residue substitutions that improve antibody performance, such as binding
                                                   -17
9866665_1 (GHMatters) P93275.AU.2

affinity, isomerization, immunogenicity, etc. The number of these amino acid substitutions
in the FR are typically no more than 6 in the H chain, and in the L chain, no more than 3.
The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an
immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further
details, see, e.g., Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323

 [0066]          A "human antibody" is an antibody that possesses an amino-acid sequence
corresponding to that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made using any of
the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human
antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding
residues. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art,
including phage-display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter, J Mol. Biol., 227:381 (1991);
Marks et al., J Mol. Biol., 222:581 (1991). Also available for the preparation of human
monoclonal antibodies are methods described in Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and
Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985); Boemer et al., J Immunol., 147(1):86-95
(1991). See also van Dijk and van de Winkel, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol., 5: 368-74 (2001).
Human antibodies can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic animal that
has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge, but whose
endogenous loci have been disabled, e.g., immunized xenomice (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos.
6,075,181 and 6,150,584 regarding XENOMOUSETM technology). See also, for example, Li
et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 103:3557-3562 (2006) regarding human antibodies
generated via a human B-cell hybridoma technology.
[0067]           The term "hypervariableregion," "HVR," or "HV," when used herein refers to the
regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form
structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the VH (HI,
H2, H3), and three in the VL (LI, L2, L3). In native antibodies, H3 and L3 display the most
diversity of the six HVRs, and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring
fine specificity to antibodies. See, e.g., Xu et al., Immunity 13:37-45 (2000); Johnson and
Wu, in Methods in Molecular Biology 248:1-25 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ, 2003).
Indeed, naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are
                                                  -18

functional and stable in the absence of light chain. See, e.g., Hamers-Castermanet al.,
Nature 363:446-448 (1993); Sheriff et al., Nature Struct. Biol. 3:733-736 (1996).
[0068]           A number of HVR delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat
Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on sequence variability and are the
most commonly used (Kabat et al., Sequences ofProteins ofImmunologicalInterest, 5th Ed.
Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)). Chothia refers
instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk, J Mol. Biol. 196:901-917
(1987)). The AbM HVRs represent a compromise between the Kabat HVRs and Chothia
structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software. The
"contact" HVRs are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The
residues from each of these HVRs are noted below.

[0069]           HVRs may comprise "extended HVRs" as follows: 24-36 or 24-34 (LI), 46-56 or
50-56 (L2) and 89-97 or 89-96 (L3) in the VL and 26-35 (HI), 50-65 or 49-65 (H2) and 93
 102, 94-102, or 95-102 (H3) in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered
according to Kabat et al., supra, for each of these definitions.
 [0070]          The expression "variable-domainresidue-numberingas in Kabat" or "amino-acid
position numbering as in Kabat," and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used
for heavy-chain variable domains or light-chain variable domains of the compilation of
antibodies in Kabat et al., supra. Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid
sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or
insertion into, a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy-chain variable
domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue
52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after
heavy-chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given
antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a
"standard" Kabat numbered sequence.

[0071]           "Framework"or "FR" residues are those variable-domain residues other than the
HVR residues as herein defined.
[0072]           A "human consensusframework" or "acceptorhumanframework" is a framework
that represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residues in a selection of human
immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally, the selection of human
immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences.
Generally, the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al., Sequences ofProteins
ofImmunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD (1991). Examples include for the VL, the subgroup may be subgroup kappa I,
kappa II, kappa III or kappa IV as in Kabat et al., supra. Additionally, for the VH, the
subgroup may be subgroup I, subgroup II, or subgroup III as in Kabat et al., supra.
Alternatively, a human consensus framework can be derived from the above in which
particular residues, such as when a human framework residue is selected based on its
homology to the donor framework by aligning the donor framework sequence with a
collection of various human framework sequences. An acceptor human framework "derived
from" a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise
the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence
changes. In some embodiments, the number of pre-existing amino acid changes are 10 or
less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less.
[0073]           A "VH subgroup III consensusframework" comprises the consensus sequence
obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable heavy subgroup III of Kabat et al., supra.
In one embodiment, the VH subgroup III consensus framework amino acid sequence
comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences:
EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAAS (HC-FR1)(SEQ ID NO:4), WVRQAPGKGLEWV
(HC-FR2), (SEQ ID NO:5), RFTISADTSKNTAYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAR (HC-FR3,
SEQ ID NO:6), WGQGTLVTVSA (HC-FR4), (SEQ ID NO:7).
[0074]           A "VL kappa I consensusframework" comprises the consensus sequence obtained
from the amino acid sequences in variable light kappa subgroup I of Kabat et al., supra. In
one embodiment, the VH subgroup I consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at
least a portion or all of each of the following sequences: DIQMTQSPSSLSASVGDRVTITC
(LC-FR1) (SEQ ID NO: 11), WYQQKPGKAPKLLIY (LC-FR2) (SEQ ID NO: 12),

[0075]           An "amino-acidmodification" at a specified position, e.g. of the Fc region, refers to
the substitution or deletion of the specified residue, or the insertion of at least one amino acid
residue adjacent the specified residue. Insertion "adjacent" to a specified residue means
insertion within one to two residues thereof. The insertion may be N-terminal or C-terminal
to the specified residue. The preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution.
[0076]           An "affinity-matured" antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more
HVRs thereof that result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen,
compared to a parent antibody that does not possess those alteration(s). In one embodiment,
an affinity-matured antibody has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target
antigen. Affinity-matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. For
example, Marks et al., Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by
VH- and VL-domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of HVR and/or framework residues is
described by, for example: Barbas et al. Proc Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3809-3813 (1994);
Schier et al. Gene 169:147-155 (1995); Yelton et al. J Immunol. 155:1994-2004 (1995);
Jackson et al., J Immunol. 154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al,J Mol. Biol. 226:889
896 (1992).
 [0077]          As use herein, the term "specifically binds to" or is "specificfor"refers to
measurable and reproducible interactions such as binding between a target and an antibody,
which is determinative of the presence of the target in the presence of a heterogeneous
population of molecules including biological molecules. For example, an antibody that
specifically binds to a target (which can be an epitope) is an antibody that binds this target
with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other
targets. In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an antibody to an unrelated target is less
than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to the target as measured, e.g., by a
radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that specifically binds to a
target has a dissociation constant (Kd) of <4 [M, <100 nM, <0 nM, < nM, or             <0. 1 nM.
In certain embodiments, an antibody specifically binds to an epitope on a protein that is
conserved among the protein from different species. In another embodiment, specific
binding can include, but does not require exclusive binding.
 [0078]          As used herein, the term "immunoadhesin" designates antibody-like molecules
which combine the binding specificity of a heterologous protein (an "adhesin") with the
effector functions of immunoglobulin constant domains. Structurally, the immunoadhesins
comprise a fusion of an amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity which is
                                                     -21
9866665_1 (GHMatters) P93275.AU.2

other than the antigen recognition and binding site of an antibody (i.e., is "heterologous"),
and an immunoglobulin constant domain sequence. The adhesin part of an immunoadhesin
molecule typically is a contiguous amino acid sequence comprising at least the binding site of
a receptor or a ligand. The immunoglobulin constant domain sequence in the
immunoadhesin may be obtained from any immunoglobulin, such as IgG- 1, IgG-2 (including
IgG2A and IgG2B), IgG-3, or IgG-4 subtypes, IgA (including IgA-I and IgA-2), IgE, IgD or
IgM. The Ig fusions preferably include the substitution of a domain of a polypeptide or
antibody described herein in the place of at least one variable region within an Ig molecule.
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the immunoglobulin fusion includes the hinge, CH2
and CH3, or the hinge, CHI, CH2 and CH3 regions of an IgGI molecule. For the production
of immunoglobulin fusions see also US Patent No. 5,428,130 issued June 27, 1995. For
example, useful immunoadhesins as second medicaments useful for combination therapy
herein include polypeptides that comprise the extracellular or PD-I binding portions of PD
LI or PD-L2 or the extracellular or PD-LI or PD-L2 binding portions of PD-1, fused to a
constant domain of an immunoglobulin sequence, such as a PD-Li ECD - Fc, a PD-L2 ECD
- Fc, and a PD-I ECD - Fc, respectively. Immunoadhesin combinations of Ig Fc and ECD of
cell surface receptors are sometimes termed soluble receptors.
[0079]           A 'fusion protein" and a "fusionpolypeptide" refer to a polypeptide having two
portions covalently linked together, where each of the portions is a polypeptide having a
different property. The property may be a biological property, such as activity in vitro or in
vivo. The property may also be simple chemical or physical property, such as binding to a
target molecule, catalysis of a reaction, etc. The two portions may be linked directly by a
single peptide bond or through a peptide linker but are in reading frame with each other.
[0080            A "PD-1 oligopeptide," "PD-Li oligopeptide," or "PD-L2 oligopeptide" is an
oligopeptide that binds, preferably specifically, to a PD-1, PD-LI or PD-L2 negative
costimulatory polypeptide, respectively, including a receptor, ligand or signaling component,
respectively, as described herein. Such oligopeptides may be chemically synthesized using
known oligopeptide synthesis methodology or may be prepared and purified using
recombinant technology. Such oligopeptides are usually at least about 5 amino acids in
length, alternatively at least about 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,

98, 99, or 100 amino acids in length or more. Such oligopeptides may be identified using
well known techniques. In this regard, it is noted that techniques for screening oligopeptide
libraries for oligopeptides that are capable of specifically binding to a polypeptide target are
well known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,556,762, 5,750,373, 4,708,871, 4,833,092,

[0081]           A "blocking" antibody or an "antagonist"antibody is one that inhibits or reduces a
biological activity of the antigen it binds. In some embodiments, blocking antibodies or
antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.
The anti-PD-LI antibodies of the invention block the signaling through PD-I so as to restore
a functional response by T-cells (e.g., proliferation, cytokine production, target cell killing)
from a dysfunctional state to antigen stimulation.
[0082]           An "agonist" or activating antibody is one that enhances or initiates signaling by the
antigen to which it binds. In some embodiments, agonist antibodies cause or activate
signaling without the presence of the natural ligand.
[0083]           The term "Fc region" herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an
immunoglobulin heavy chain, including native-sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions.
Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the
human IgG heavy-chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at
position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The C-terminal lysine
(residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for
example, during production or purification of the antibody, or by recombinantly engineering
the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly, a composition of
intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed,
antibody populations with no K447 residues removed, and antibody populations having a
mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue. Suitable native-sequence Fc

regions for use in the antibodies of the invention include human IgG 1, IgG2 (IgG2A,
IgG2B), IgG3 and IgG4.
[0084]           "Fc receptor" or "FcR" describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an
antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is
one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcyRI,
FcyRII, and Fc7RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of
these receptors, FcyRII receptors include FcyRIIA (an "activating receptor") and FcyRIIB (an
"inhibiting receptor"), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the
cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor FcyRIIA contains an immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor
FcyRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its
cytoplasmic domain. (see M. Daeron, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234 (1997). FcRs are
reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9: 457-92 (1991); Capel et al.,
Immunomethods 4: 25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., J Lab. Clin. Med. 126: 330-41 (1995).
Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term "FcR"
herein.
[0085]           The term "Fc receptor" or "FcR" also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which
is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus. Guyer et al., J Immunol. 117:
587 (1976) and Kim et al., J Immunol. 24: 249 (1994). Methods of measuring binding to
FcRn are known (see, e.g., Ghetie and Ward, Immunol. Today 18: (12): 592-8 (1997); Ghetie
et al., Nature Biotechnology 15 (7): 637-40 (1997); Hinton et al., J Biol. Chem. 279 (8):
6213-6 (2004); WO 2004/92219 (Hinton et al.). Binding to FcRn in vivo and serum half-life
of human FcRn high-affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed, e.g., in transgenic mice or
transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn, or in primates to which the
polypeptides having a variant Fc region are administered. WO 2004/42072 (Presta) describes
antibody variants which improved or diminished binding to FcRs. See also, e.g., Shields et
al., J Biol. Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001).
[0086]           The phrase "substantiallyreduced," or "substantiallydifferent," as used herein,
denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values (generally one
associated with a molecule and the other associated with a reference/comparator molecule)
such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of
statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said
                                                   -24

values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, greater than
about 10%, greater than about 20%, greater than about 30%, greater than about 40%, and/or
greater than about 50% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator molecule.
[0087]           The term "substantiallysimilar" or "substantiallythe same," as used herein,
denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (for example,
one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a
reference/comparator antibody), such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference
between the two values to be of little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the
context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The
difference between said two values is, for example, less than about 50%, less than about
40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, and/or less than about 10% as a function of
the reference/comparator value.
 [0088]          "Carriers"as used herein include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients,
or stabilizers that are nontoxic to the cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages
and concentrations employed. Often the physiologically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH
buffered solution. Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include buffers such as
phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low
molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin,
gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino
acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides,
disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating
agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions
such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEENTM, polyethylene glycol (PEG),
and PLURONICS TM.
 [0089]          A "packageinsert" refers to instructions customarily included in commercial
packages of medicaments that contain information about the indications customarily included
in commercial packages of medicaments that contain information about the indications,
usage, dosage, administration, contraindications, other medicaments to be combined with the
packaged product, and/or warnings concerning the use of such medicaments, etc.
 [0090]          As used herein, the term "treatment" refers to clinical intervention designed to alter
the natural course of the individual or cell being treated during the course of clinical
pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include decreasing the rate of disease progression,
ameliorating or palliating the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. For
                                                    -25

example, an individual is successfully "treated" if one or more symptoms associated with
cancer are mitigated or eliminated, including, but are not limited to, reducing the proliferation
of (or destroying) cancerous cells, decreasing symptoms resulting from the disease,
increasing the quality of life of those suffering from the disease, decreasing the dose of other
medications required to treat the disease, delaying the progression of the disease, and/or
prolonging survival of individuals.
[0091]           As used herein, "delaying progression of a disease" means to defer, hinder, slow,
retard, stabilize, and/or postpone development of the disease (such as cancer). This delay can
be of varying lengths of time, depending on the history of the disease and/or individual being
treated. As is evident to one skilled in the art, a sufficient or significant delay can, in effect,
encompass prevention, in that the individual does not develop the disease. For example, a
late stage cancer, such as development of metastasis, may be delayed.
[0092]           An "effective amount" is at least the minimum concentration required to effect a
measurable improvement or prevention of a particular disorder. An effective amount herein
may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the patient,
and the ability of the antibody to elicit a desired response in the individual. An effective
amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the treatment are outweighed
by the therapeutically beneficial effects. For prophylactic use, beneficial or desired results
include results such as eliminating or reducing the risk, lessening the severity, or delaying the
onset of the disease, including biochemical, histological and/or behavioral symptoms of the
disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during
development of the disease. For therapeutic use, beneficial or desired results include clinical
results such as decreasing one or more symptoms resulting from the disease, increasing the
quality of life of those suffering from the disease, decreasing the dose of other medications
required to treat the disease, enhancing effect of another medication such as via targeting,
delaying the progression of the disease, and/or prolonging survival. In the case of cancer or
tumor, an effective amount of the drug may have the effect in reducing the number of cancer
cells; reducing the tumor size; inhibiting (i.e., slow to some extent or desirably stop) cancer
cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and desirably stop)
tumor metastasis; inhibiting to some extent tumor growth; and/or relieving to some extent
one or more of the symptoms associated with the disorder. An effective amount can be
administered in one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective
amount of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to
                                                      -26
9866665_1 (GHMatters) P93275.AU.2

accomplish prophylactic or therapeutic treatment either directly or indirectly. As is
understood in the clinical context, an effective amount of a drug, compound, or
pharmaceutical composition may or may not be achieved in conjunction with another drug,
compound, or pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an "effective amount" may be considered
in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be
considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other
agents, a desirable result may be or is achieved.
[0093]           As used herein, "in conjunction with" refers to administration of one treatment
modality in addition to another treatment modality. As such, "in conjunction with" refers to
administration of one treatment modality before, during, or after administration of the other
treatment modality to the individual.
[0094]           As used herein, "complete response" or "CR" refers to disappearance of all target
lesions; "partial response" or "PR" refers to at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest
diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SLD; and "stable disease"
or "SD" refers to neither sufficient shrinkage of target lesions to qualify for PR, nor sufficient
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SLD since the treatment started.
[0095]           As used herein, "progressive disease" or "PD" refers to at least a 20% increase in
the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment
started or the presence of one or more new lesions.
[0096]           As used herein, "progression free survival" (PFS) refers to the length of time during
and after treatment during which the disease being treated (e.g., cancer) does not get worse.
Progression-free survival may include the amount of time patients have experienced a
complete response or a partial response, as well as the amount of time patients have
experienced stable disease.
[0097]           As used herein, "overall response rate" (ORR) refers to the sum of complete
response (CR) rate and partial response (PR) rate.
[0098]           As used herein, "overall survival" refers to the percentage of individuals in a group
who are likely to be alive after a particular duration of time.
[0099]           A "chemotherapeuticagent" is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of
cancer. Examples of chemotherapeutic agents include alkylating agents such as thiotepa and
cyclophosphamide (CYTOXAN@); alkyl sulfonates such as busulfan, improsulfan, and

                                                EXAMPLES
[0206]           The invention can be further understood by reference to the following examples,
which are provided by way of illustration and are not meant to be limiting.
Example 1: MEK inhibitor enhanced MHC I expression on tumor cell lines
[0207]           To determine if treatment with MEK inhibitor (MEKi) enhanced immunogenicity of
tumor cells, surface expression of MHC-I on tumor cell lines treated with MEK inhibitors
GDC-0973 and G-38963 was assayed. Briefly, human melanoma cell lines (Malme-3M,
A2058, A375, HS294T, SK23, SKMEL-28, 537 Mel, RPMI-795) and human colorectal cell
lines (Colo 320 DM, Colo 205, WiDr, Colo 741, RKO, DLD-1, HM7, HCT-15) were treated
with 1 micromolar MEKi GDC-0973 or G-38963, BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) GDC-0879, or
DMSO vehicle for 24 hours. Following treatment, cells were stained for surface MHC Class
I expression with an antibody against HLA-A,B,C for subsequent FACS analysis. Data
shown is for treatment with MEKi GDC-0973. Labeled isotype-matched antibodies were
used to determine the level of non-specific staining. Data analysis and construction of
histograms demonstrated that cell surface expression of MHC-I was upregulated in MEKi
treated cells as compared to vehicle treated cells (Figure 1A). In contrast, cell surface
expression of MHC-I in BRAFi treated cells was not upregulated as compared to vehicle
treated cells (Figure 2). These results demonstrate that enhanced cell surface expression of
MHC-I in both melanoma and colorectal tumor cells is specific to MEK inhibition and not
due to general inhibition of the RAS/RAF/MEK signaling pathway.
[0208]           To determine if treatment with MEK inhibitor (MEKi) enhanced immunogenicity of
mouse tumor cells similarly to human tumor cells, surface expression of MHC-I on mouse
tumor cell lines treated with MEKi GDC-0973 was assayed. Briefly, mouse melanoma cell
lines (MC38 and B16.F10) and a mouse colorectal cell line (CT26) were treated with MEKi
GDC-0973, G-38963 or vehicle. Briefly, cells were stimulated for 24 hours with 1
micromolar MEK inhibitor or DMSO vehicle control. Following treatment, cells were
surfaced stained with an antibody against MHC-I (H-2D) and expression was assayed by
subsequent FACS analysis. Labeled isotype-matched antibodies were used to determine the
                                                    -86
9866665_1 (GHMatters) P93275.AU.2

level of non-specific staining. Data analysis and construction of histograms demonstrated
that cell surface expression of MHC-I was upregulated in MEKi treated cells (data shown is
for MEKi GDC-0973) as compared to vehicle treated cells (Figure IB). These results
demonstrate that enhanced cell surface expression of MHC-I occurred across several
melanoma and colorectal tumor cell lines regardless of mouse or human origin.
[0209]           To determine if enhanced cell surface expression of MHC-I is specific to tumor
cells, the effect of MEKi treatment on MHC-I expression on human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PMBCs) was assayed. Briefly, PMBCS were isolated from whole blood
by first diluting it with an equal volume of room temperature PBS and subsequent overlay
onto Ficoll-filled Leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-One). Post-centrifugation, the PBMC
interface was then washed twice and resuspended in culture media (RPMI-1640 with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 20pM HEPES, 55pM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50pg/ml gentamicin, and 1:100
dilutions of the following supplements from Gibco: Gluta-MAX, sodium pyruvate,
penicillin/streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids). Cells were plated in 6 well plates at
4x10 6 per well with a total of 4 ml per well. MEK inhibitor GDC-0973 was added at either
 1pM or 3pM. Cells were harvested 24 hours later and distributed to a 96-well V-bottom
plate for FACS staining. Cells were stained with the following antibodies (all from BD
Biosciences, at 1:10 for 30 minutes on ice): CD3-FITC, HLA-ABC-PE, CD4-APC, CD19
FITC, and CD14-FITC. Propidium iodide was included to exclude dead cells. Samples
were run on a BD FACSCaliber flow cytometer and data was analyzed using FlowJo
software (Tree Star, Inc.). Data analysis and construction of histograms demonstrated that
cell surface expression of MHC-I was not upregulated in CD4+ T cells (Figure 3A), CD8+ T
cells (Figure 3B), B cells (Figure 3C), or monocytes (Figure 3D) treated with 1pM MEKi
GDC-0973 or 3pM MEKi GDC-0973 as compared to vehicle treated cells. These results
demonstrate that enhanced cell surface expression of MHC-I by MEK inhibitor treatment is
specific to tumor cells.
Example 2: Co-stimulatory signals made T cells resistant to TCR signaling inactivation
by MEK inhibitor
[0210]           Recent studies have shown that MEK inhibitor treatment impairs T lymphocyte
function (Boni et al., CancerRes., 70(13), 2010). To confirm that MEK inhibitor treatment
impaired CD8+ T cells, T cells were treated with MEKi in combination with T cell
                                                    -87
9866665_1 (GHMatters) P93275.AU.2

stimulation signals and assayed for T cell proliferation. Briefly, human CD8+ T cells were
purified from whole blood using StemCell Technologies human CD8 RosetteSep as per
manufacturer' s instructions. Purified cells were       #ated at 200,000 per well in triplicate in 96
well U-bottom plates with 200,000 per well of either anti-CD3 or anti-CD3/anti-CD28
Dynabeads (Invitrogen). MEK inhibitors GDC-0973 and G-38963 were titrated 10-fold from
 10pM to 0.001pM such that the final culture concentration was 0.5% DMSO in a total
volume of 200pl per well. Culture medium was RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum,
20gM HEPES, 55gM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50pg/ml gentamicin, and 1:100 dilutions of the
following supplements from Gibco: Gluta-MAX, sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin,
and non-essential amino acids. At 48 hours, wells were pulsed with 1pCi/well of 3H
thymidine and cultured an additional 16 hours prior to freezing and harvest. Data analysis
demonstrated that treatment of CD8+ T cells with anti-CD3 stimulated T cell activation
(closed triangle) as compared to unstimulated T cells (open circle). Treatment of T cells with
two different MEK inhibitors reduced the stimulatory effect of anti-CD3 (closed circle,
closed square) at all MEKi concentrations tested, with nearly complete inhibition of T cell
receptor induced proliferation occurring at 0.01 pM MEKi treatment (Figure 4A). In
contrast, co-stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in MEKi treated T cells (closed circle,
closed square) was sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effect of MEKi on T cell activation
(Figure 4B). These unexpected results demonstrate the novel finding that inhibition of TCR
signaling by MEKi treatment can be overcome by providing sufficient T cell co-stimulation
which is provided to T cells by antigen presenting cells such as B cells, macrophages, and
dendritic cells.
[0211]           Without being bound to theory, a key component of co-stimulation is thought to be
the activation of P13 kinase and is provided by CD28 via association of P13K p 8 5 subunit
with its cytoplsmic YMNM motif. PD-1, through its interaction with SHP2, impedes the
activity of P13K. Therefore, blockade of the PDI axis may disinhibit Pl3kinase, resulting in
enhanced T cell costimulation and provides a means to overcome the inhibitory effect of
MEKi on T cell activation. PD-1/-LI blockade is to enhance co-stimulation under conditions
when expression of co-stimulatory ligands such as B7.1 and B7.2 is often limiting such as in
most tumors or the tumor microenvironment. Combining MEKi with blockade of the PD 1
axis should enhance tumor specific T cell immunity by enhancing Ag recognition by the
TCR through upregulation of tumor MHC I (enhancing Signal I) by MEKi and by relieving
inhibition of P13K (enhancing Signal 2) through PDI/PDLI blockade.

Example 3: MEK inhibitor specifically enhanced maturation and activation of dendritic
cells
[0212]           To determine if MEK inhibitor treatment specifically enhanced tumor
immunogenicity by stimulating dendritic cells (DCs), monocyte-derived dendritic cells were
treated with increasing concentration of MEKi GDC-0973, MEKi GDC-38963 or BRAFi
GDC-0879 in combination with antibodies to the DC co-stimulatory molecule CD40.
Briefly, human monocytes were purified from whole blood using StemCell Technologies
human monocyte RosetteSep as per manufacturer' s instructions. Monocytes were seeded in
T175 flasks at approximately 0.5-1.0x10        6 per ml in 50ng/ml human GM-CSF and 1OOng/ml
human IL-4 for 7 days total, with half-media exchanges every 2 days. Cells were then
harvested and plated at 100,000 cells/well in 96-well flat bottom plates with or without Pfizer
anti-CD40 at 1pg/ml. MEK inhibitors and BRAF inhibitor were titrated 10-fold from 10pM
to 0.001pM such that the final culture concentration was 0.5% DMSO in a total volume of
200pl per well. Forty-eight hours later, cells were harvested and transferred to a 96-well V
bottom plate. Cells were first Fc-receptor blocked (Miltenyi) and then stained using the
following antibodies (from BD Biosciences at 1:10, 30 minutes on ice): HLA-DR,-DP,-DQ
FITC, HLA-ABC-PE, CD83-APC, CD14-FITC, CD80-PE, and CD86-APC. Propidium
iodide was included to exclude dead cells. Samples were run on a BD FACSCaliber flow
cytometer and data was analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). Data analysis and
construction of histograms demonstrated that the frequency of cells expressing the maturation
marker CD83 (Figure 5A), MHC-II (Figure 5B), and co-stimulatory molecule CD86 (Figure
5C) was increased in cells treated with 1gM MEKi GDC-0973 as compared to vehicle treated
cells. In contrast, cell surface expression of these DC surface activation markers in DCs
treated with 1gM BRAFi was not upregulated and was similar to vehicle treated cells.
Furthermore, increasing concentrations of either MEKi G-38963 (closed square) or MEKi
GDC-0973 (closed circle) enhanced the frequency of DCs expressing these surface markers
of DC maturation and activation in concentration dependent manner (Figure 5D-5F). In
contrast BRAFi (closed triangle) treatment did not enhance the anti-CD40 co-stimulatory
effect. These novel results demonstrate that enhanced maturation and activation of DCs is
specific to MEK inhibitor treatment and not due to general inhibition of the RAS/RAF/MEK
signaling pathway. Furthermore, MEKi enhanced activation of human monocyte-derived
                                                    -89
9866665_1 (GHMatters) P93275.AU.2

DCs co-stimulated with anti-CD40 in a concentration dependent manner indicating that
MEKi may have an immunomodulatory effect on DCs.
Example 4: Co-treatment with MEK inhibitor and anti-PD-Li antibodies reduced
serum levels of cytokines that promote tumor growth
[0213]           Due to the novel observation that MEKi treatment enhanced T cell and DC
activation in the presence of a co-stimulator, MEKi G-38963 was used in combination with
anti-PD-Li antibodies to determine if MEKi could enhance the anti-tumor effects of anti-PD
LI antibody treatment and modulate cytokine levels in tumor bearing animals. The anti-PD
Li antibody employed in these experiments was PRO314483, LOT#59554.96, raised against
human PD-Li and recognizes both human and murine PD-Li. Briefly, 7 days after
treatment, mice were anaesthetized and bled retro-orbitally for serum. Analysis for serum
levels of cytokines was conducted using the BioRad Bio-Plex assay and it was determined
that the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 was significantly reduced in in vivo models for
both melanoma (Figure 6A) and colorectal (Figure 6C) tumors. IL-10 levels were decreased
with anti-PD-Li antibody or MEKi treatment alone but were significantly reduced by co
treatment with MEKi and anti-PD-LI antibodies. Furthermore, serum levels of the murine
chemokine KC, homolog of the human chemokine IL-8 that is known to play a role in tumor
progression, was also significantly reduced in in vivo models for both melanoma (Figure 6B)
and colorectal (Figure 6D) tumors with the most significant reduction induced by co
treatment with MEKi and anti-PD-LI antibodies. These results indicate that combination
treatment of anti-PD-LI antibodies and MEKi inhibits release of cytokines that promote
tumor growth.
Example 5: MEK inhibition enhanced anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-Li antibodies in
colorectal tumors in vivo
 [0214]          To determine if MEKi enhanced the anti-tumor effect of anti-PD-Li antibodies,
mouse models for colorectal tumors were treated with the combination treatment. Briefly,
mice were inoculated subcutaneously with tumor cells and allowed to grow tumors. When
tumor bearing mice achieved a mean tumor volume of 200 mm3 (Figure 7A) or 450 mm3
(Figure 7B), mice were randomly assigned to I of 4 treatment groups. Group 1: received 10
mg/kg of an isotype control antibody (anti-gp120, PR067181, PUR#20455) intraperitoneally
three times a week for 3 weeks plus MCT control vehicle, orally, daily for 21 days; Group 2:
received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-Li antibody PRO314483, LOT#59554.96 intraperitoneally three
                                                    -90
9866665_1 (GHMatters) P93275.AU.2

times a week for three weeks; Group 3: received 10 mg/kg of an isotype control antibody
(anti-gp120, PR067181, PUR#20455) intraperitoneally 3x/week x 3 plus 75 mg/kg MEKi G
38963, orally, daily for 21 days; Group 4: received 10 mg/kg of an anti-PD-LI antibody
PRO314483, LOT#59554.96 intraperitoneally three times a week for three weeks plus 75
mg/kg MEKi G-38963, orally, daily for 21 days. Mice were monitored for tumor growth and
body weight changes. Blockade of PD-L1 with anti-PD-Li antibody PRO314483,
LOT#5944.96 either in early (Figure 7A) or in late (Figure 7B) intervention was highly
effective as a single agent therapy at preventing tumor growth. Treatment with MEKi G
38963 was also highly effective as a single agent therapy at preventing tumor growth either
in early or in late intervention and was comparable to anti-PD-Li antibody treatment.
Combination treatment with anti-PD-LI antibodies and MEKi significantly inhibited tumor
growth both in early and late intervention and was significantly more effective than anti-PD
LI antibodies or MEKi treatment alone. Furthermore, co-treatment at an early stage of tumor
growth resulted not only in significant reduction of tumor volume but also demonstrated a
sustained response. Early intervention resulted in about a 60% complete response that was
maintained for at least 92 days. These results indicate that MEKi enhanced the anti-tumor
activity of PD-LI blockade and therefore worked synergistically with anti-PD-LI antibodies
to inhibit tumor growth.
[0215]           To further determine if MEKi enhanced the anti-tumor effect of anti-PD-Li
antibodies, mouse models for colorectal tumors were treated with the combination treatment
using a different MEK inhibitor, MEKi GDC-0973, in two different studies.
[0216]           For the first study, female BALB/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the
unilateral thoracic region with 100,000 CT26 murine colorectal cells in 100 pL of
HBSS:matrigel. When mice achieved a mean tumor volume of approximately 200 mm3,
they were randomly assigned to one of nine different treatment groups on experimental day 0
and treatment was initiated on experimental day 1. Groups of 10 mice were orally given the
following in a volume of 200 pl daily for 21 days: Group 1 received MCT vehicle; Group 2
received 0.5 mg/kg GDC-0973; Group 3 received 1.0 mg/kg GDC-0973; Group 4 received
2.0 mg/kg GDC-0973; Group 5 received 3.0 mg/kg GDC-0973; Group 6 received 4.0 mg/kg
GDC-0973; Group 7 received 5.0 mg/kg GDC-0973; Group 8 received 6.0 mg/kg GDC
0973; and Group 9 received 7.5 mg/kg GDC-0973.
[0217]           For the second study, female BALB/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the
unilateral thoracic region with 100,000 CT26 murine colorectal cells in 100 pL of
                                                    -91
9866665_1 (GHMatters) P93275.AU.2

HBSS:matrigel. When mice achieved a mean tumor volume of approximately 200 mm3,
they were randomly assigned to one of six different treatment groups on experimental day 0
and treatment was initiated on experimental day 1. Groups of 10 mice were given the
following: Group 1 received MCT vehicle orally in 200 uL volume daily for 21 days and 10
mg/kg of an isotype control antibody (anti-gp120, PR067181, PUR#20455) intraperitoneally
3 times per week; Group 2 received 7.5 mg/kg GDC-0973 orally daily for 21 days; Group 3
received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-Li antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 intraperitoneally 3 times
per week; Group 4 received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-Li antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96
intraperitoneally 3 times per week and 1.0 mg/kg GDC-0973 orally daily for 21 days; Group
5 received 10 mg/kg anti-PD-Li antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 intraperitoneally 3
times per week and 3.0 mg/kg GDC-0973 orally daily for 21 days; and Group 6 received 10
mg/kg anti-PD-Li antibody PRO314483, LOT#5944.96 intraperitoneally 3 times per week
and 6.0 mg/kg GDC-0973 orally daily for 21 days. The anti-PD-Li antibody PRO314483,
LOT#5944.96 was a reverse chimera, containing the human variable region of MPDL3280A
and the murine constant region of IgG2A, with an effector-less Fc D265A/N297A
substitution in the constant region.
[0218]           For both studies, mice were monitored for tumor growth and body weight changes
two to three times per week for the duration of the study. For measurement of tumor growth,
tumor volume was measured using UltraCal-IV calipers (Model 54-10-111; Fred V. Fowler
Company; Newton, MA) with length and width measurements perpendicular to one another,
and tumor volume was calculated using the equation:
                                          Tumor Volume (mm 3)  =  (Length x Width 2 ) x 0.5
[0219]           For measurement of body weights, mice were weighed using an Adventura Pro
AV812 scale (Ohaus Corporation; Pine Brook, NJ). Percent body weight change was
calculated using the equation:
                            Body weight change (%) = [(WeightDay new - WeightDay 0)/WeightDay 0] X 100
[0220]           Data was analyzed using R, version 2.9.2 (R Development Core Team 2008; R
Foundation for Statistical Computing; Vienna, Austria), and the mixed models were fit within
R using the nlme package, version 3.1-96 (Pinheiro J et al., R package version 3. 2009, 1
96). Plotting was performed in Prism, version 5.Ob for Mac (GraphPad Software, Inc.; La
Jolla, CA). A mixed modeling approach was used to analyze the repeated measurement of
tumor volumes from the same animals over time (Pinheiro J et al., Statistics and Computing,
Springer. 2010). This approach addressed both repeated measurements and modest dropouts

tumor volume at any time during the study. Overall Response Rate (ORR) was defined as
the sum of the complete and partial responses.

group. Linear mixed-effects analysis was also employed to analyze the repeated
measurement of body weight changes from the same animals over time.

[0225]           Further studies were conducted to determine if additional MEK inhibitors
(G02443714, G02442104, and G00039805) also enhanced the anti-tumor effect of anti-PD

mice were monitored for tumor growth and body weight changes two to three times per week
for the duration of the study. For measurement of tumor growth, tumor volume was
measured using UltraCal-IV calipers (Model 54-10-111; Fred V. Fowler Company; Newton,
MA) with length and width measurements perpendicular to one another, and tumor volume
was calculated using the equation:

 [0234]          Combination treatment with the anti-PD-Li antibody and G02443714 resulted in
enhanced reduction of tumor growth for a longer period of time as compared to treatment
with anti-PD-Li antibodies or G02443714 alone with a 20% partial response observed at 18
days (Figure 9). Combination treatment with the anti-PD-Li antibody and G02442104 also
resulted in enhanced reduction of tumor growth for a longer period of time as compared to
treatment with anti-PD-Li antibodies or MEKi G02442104 alone with a 40% partial response
and 10% complete response observed at 37.5 days (Figure 10). In addition, combination
treatment with the anti-PD-Li antibody and G00039805 resulted in enhanced reduction of
tumor growth for a longer period of time as compared to treatment with anti-PD-Li
antibodies or MEKi G00039805 alone with a 30% partial response observed at 22 days

enhance the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-LI antibodies to inhibit tumor growth.

mice were inoculated subcutaneously with tumor cells and allowed to grow tumors. When
tumor bearing mice achieved a mean tumor volume of 100-200 mm3, mice were randomly
assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. Group 1: received 10 mg/kg of an isotype control

PRO314483, LOT#59554.96 intraperitoneally three times a week for three weeks plus 75
mg/kg MEKi G-38963, orally, daily for 21 days. Mice were monitored for tumor growth and
body weight changes. Blockade of PD-L1 with anti-PD-Li antibody PRO314483,
LOT#59554.96 in Cloudman S91 (Figure 12) melanoma tumors was effective as a single
agent therapy at preventing tumor growth. Treatment with MEKi G-38963 was also highly
effective as a single agent therapy at preventing tumor growth (Figure 12) and was
comparable to anti-PD-Li antibody treatment. Combination treatment with anti-PD-Li
antibodies and MEKi significantly inhibited tumor growth in both melanoma cell lines. In
contrast, Temodar, a chemotherapeutic agent, when used in combination with anti-PD-Li
antibodies inhibited the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-Li antibodies (Figure 13). Similar
results were obtained when an antibody that blocks the T cell OX40 co-stimulatory molecule
was used in combination with the MEK inhibitor G-38963 (Figure 14). These results
indicate that MEKi specifically enhanced the anti-tumor activity of PD-LI blockade and
therefore worked synergistically with anti-PD-LI antibodies to inhibit melanoma tumor
growth.
Example 7: MEK inhibitor increased activation of dendritic cells independently of
PDL1 antibody activity
[0236]           Previous studies have indicated that MEK inhibition can augment immune function
by downregulation of surface PD-LI suggesting that the effects of MEKi were mediated via
alterations in PD-LI expression. To determine if enhanced tumor immunogenicity is due to
dependency of PD-LI expression upon MEK activation, activation of dendritic cells was
compared when treated with MEKi GDC-0973 alone, anti-PD-LI antibodies (a chimeric
antibody composed of variable regions of MPDL3280A fused to mouse IgG2a constant

alone or MEKi in combination with anti-PD-LI antibodies. Briefly, mouse bone marrow
cells were isolated and seeded at 2x 106 per 1Oml total volume per 10cm non-tissue culture
treated dishes with 40ng/ml mouse GM-CSF for 7 days. Fresh media was half-exchanged
every 2-3 days. Culture medium was RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20pM
HEPES, 55pM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50pg/ml gentamicin, and 1:100 dilutions of the following
supplements from Gibco: Gluta-MAX, sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin, and non
essential amino acids. On day 7 all cells were harvested and washed, then seeded at 100,000
cells/well in a 96-well flat-bottom plate. MEK inhibitor GDC-0973 was added at a final
concentration of 1pM, anti-PDL 1 human/mouse reverse chimera or anti-Ragweed mouse
IgG2a isotype control (Genentech PUR 22251) were added at 10pg/ml. Prior to adding to
cells for a final concentration of 1p g/ml each, anti-CD40 clone FGK-45 (Genentech lot
68020-62) was crossed-linked with goat anti-Rat IgG Fc-gamma-receptor (Jackson
ImmunoResearch) at room temperature for one hour. After 48 hours of stimulation, cells
were harvested and transferred to a 96-well V-bottom plate. Samples were first Fc receptor
blocked (purified anti-CD16/CD32 from BD Biosciences, 5pg/ml) and then stained with I
A/I-E-FITC, H-2Db/H-2Kb-biotin (followed by streptavidin-PE), CD 11 c-APC, CD86-FITC,
and CD80-PE (all from BD Biosciences). Propidium iodide was included to exclude dead
cells. Samples were run on a BD FACSCaliber flow cytometer and data was analyzed using
FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). Treatment with functionally blocking anti-PD-LI
antibodies alone modestly increased DC surface expression of MHC-I (Figure 15A) however
it did not induce expression of DC surface activation markers MHC-II (Figure 15B), CD80
(Figure 15C), or CD86 (Figure 15D). In contrast MEKi treatment enhanced MHC-II, CD80,
and CD86 as well as MHC-I expression. Interestingly, combination treatment of MEKi and
anti-PD-LI antibodies did not alter DC surface activation markers as compared to MEKi
alone. Similar results were obtained with the addition of the co-stimulatory anti-CD40
antibodies (Figure 15E-H). These novel findings indicate that MEKi induced activation of
DCs independently of its effect on PD-Li expression. Altogether these results demonstrate
that MEKi increased tumor immunogenicity by mechanisms unique from anti-PDL and
provide support for combining MEKi and PD-LI blockade for optimal enhancement of anti
tumor immunity.

Example 8a: MEK Assay (MEK activity assay)
[0237]           Constitutively activated human mutant MEKI expressed in insect cells is used as
source of enzymatic activity at a final concentration in the kinase assay of 62.5nM.
[0238]           The assay is carried out for 30 minutes in the presence of 50pM ATP using
recombinant GST-ERK1 produced in E.Coli as substrate. Phosphorylation of the substrate is
detected and quantified using HTRF reagents supplied by Cisbio. These consist of an anti
GST antibody conjugated to allophycocyanin (XL665) and an anti-phospho (Thr202/Tyr2O4)
ERK antibody conjugated to europium-cryptate. The anti-phospho antibody recognises ERK1
dually phosphorylated on Thr202 and Tyr204. When both antibodies are bound to ERK1 (i.e.
when the substrate is phosphorylated), energy transfer from the cryptate to the
allophycocyanin occurs following excitation at 340nm, resulting in fluorescence being
emitted that is proportional to the amount of phosphorylated substrate produced.
Fluorescence is detected using a multiwell fluorimeter.

Example 8b: MEK Assay (MEK activity assay)
[0241]           Constitutively activated human mutant MEKI expressed in insect cells is used as
source of enzymatic activity at a final concentration in the kinase assay of 15nM.
[0242]           The assay is carried out for 30 minutes in the presence of 50pM ATP using
recombinant GST-ERK1 produced in E.Coli as substrate. Phosphorylation of the substrate is
detected and quantified using HTRF reagents supplied by Cisbio. These consist of an anti
GST antibody conjugated to allophycocyanin (XL665) and an anti-phospho (Thr202/Tyr204)
ERK antibody conjugated to europium-cryptate. These are used at a final concentration of
4tg/ml and 0.84pg/ml respectively. The anti-phospho antibody recognises ERK1 dually
phosphorylated on Thr202 and Tyr204. When both antibodies are bound to ERKI (i.e. when
the substrate is phosphorylated), energy transfer from the cryptate to the allophycocyanin
occurs following excitation at 340nm, resulting in fluorescence being emitted that is
                                                     -100
