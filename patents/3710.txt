                       STEEL ALLOY FOR A LOW ALLOY HIGH-STRENGTH STEEL
Description
[001]                       The invention relates to a steel alloy for a low alloy high strength steel
which at the same time is tenacious and has excellent wear resistance according to
patent claim 1.
[002]                       In particular, the invention relates to pipes, strips and sheets made of
this alloy, from which for example components for the automobile industry such as
vehicle bodies, components of support structures or airbag tubes and cylinder tubes
are produced. In the field of construction-machine industry, wear plates made of this
alloy can for example be used in case of high wear requirements for excavator
shovels. Such steels are also used for applications where sudden impact energies
have to be absorbed, for example as bullet proof armor.
[003]                       Pipes produced from this alloy can be configured as welded pipes that
are produced from hot or cold strip or in a seamlessly, and which depending on the
case can have a cross section which deviates from the circular shape.
[004]                       Construction pipes or plates made of this alloy can also be used for
welded steel constructions that are exposed to particularly high stress for example in
crane construction, bridge construction, hoist construction and heavy-duty vehicle
construction.
[005]                       The demands for ever higher strength and improved processing
properties and component properties while at the same time reducing weight and/or
costs have lead among other things to the development of ultra-fine grained duplex
steels which are also known under the name "Super Bainite" as carbide-free steels.
The generation of such a microstructure consisting of bainitic ferrite with residual
9991858 1 (GHMatters) P99274.AL.1

                                                        2
austenite lamellae is schematically shown in Figure 1 in contrast to the upper and
lower bainite microstructure.
[006]                       Characteristic for these steels is for example a strength of 1000 to
about 2000 MPa, an elongation at brake of at least 5% depending on the strength
and an extremely fine (nano) structured bainitic microstructure with portions of
residual austenite.
[007]                       The approach for generating this ultra-fine microstructure is based on
the phase transformation at low temperatures in the bainite region while avoiding the
precipitation of cementite and formation of martensite. Suppression of carbides that
precipitate in the bainite such as cementite is necessary because on one hand, these
have a strong embrittling effect as possible fracture inducers thereby preventing
achieving the required tenacity, and on the other hand, the proportions of stabilized
austenite, which are necessary for achieving the properties according to the
invention, cannot be established.
[008]                       The economic use of these steels is impeded, however, because at
these low transformation                    temperatures the transformation     kinetic is strongly
decelerated which depending on the alloy composition, in particular with increasing
carbon content, can lead to longer isothermal holding times of many hours up to one
or more days. Such long processing times are, however, not acceptable for an
economic production of components so that alloy concepts were pursued as
solutions to accelerate the transformation.
[009]                       An    alloy composition   which   requires  such   a   long   isothermal
transformation time of up to 48 hours is known from WO 2009/0-75494. It is also
disadvantageous that this steel contains expensive nickel, molybdenum, boron and
titanium beside carbon and iron and the achievable tenacities are not yet sufficient
for the described fields of application.
9991858 1 (GHMatters) P99274.AL.1

                                                           3
[0010]                      Carbide-free bainitic steels for rail tracks are for example known from
DE 696 31 953 T2. Beside manganese, chromium and further elements such as
molybdenum nickel vanadium wolfram titanium and boron, the steel alloy disclosed
there has a silicon content between 1 and 3%.
[0011]                      This publication also mentions that beside silicone the addition of
aluminum can reduce or suppress the formation of carbides in the bainite and can
stabilize the remaining residual austenite. This steel also allows overcoming the
disadvantage of a long transformation time, wherein a corresponding bainitic
microstructure can be generated by continuous cooling at air (air hardening) alone.
[0012]                      This steel is configured for the demands on rail tracks that are exposed
to strong wear stress, however it cannot be used or is uneconomical for strips, sheets
and pipes for the mentioned field of application because in these cases beside the
demands on wear resistance, the strength and tenacity requirements also have to be
met. In addition, due the their compact cross section, the cross sectional dimensions
of rails significantly differ from those of strips, sheets and pipes which requires
adjustment of the alloying concept with regard to the material properties to be
achieved after air cooling of the steel. A disadvantage of the known steel is also the
expensive addition of titanium and other alloy elements such as nickel, molybdenum
and wolfram.
[0013]                      A further problem in the known steels is that no information regarding
the nitrogen content are given which adversely affects material properties in
particular through formation of aluminum nitrides when aluminum is added.
[0014]                      As a result of the addition of aluminum due to the great affinity to the
nitrogen present in the steel, coarse aluminum                           nitrides are formed during
solidification which precipitate primarily in the steel which has a very negative effect
on the ductility notch impact toughness the bursting behavior and the service life of
9991858 1 (GHMatters) P99274.AL.1

                                                          4
the steel and with this significantly deteriorates the mechanical properties.
[0015]                      As a result, this known steel alloy in which instead of silicone, aluminum
or in addition further aluminum is added, is rendered unusable in praxis because the
amount of precipitations and size of deleterious aluminum nitrides is dependent on
the respective nitrogen and aluminum content in the steel and, because the nitrogen
is not taken into account, the concrete material properties cannot be predicted. In
addition, the achievable tenacities for the described field of application according to
the invention are also not sufficiently high.
[0016]                      The demands on the mechanical properties of the steel alloy that have
to be satisfied can be summarized as follows:
[0017]                      Strength:                                  1250 to 2500 MPa
[0018]                      Elongation at break                        above 12%
[0019]                      Notch impact toughness at -20OC:           at least 15 J
[0020]                      Object of the invention is to set forth a steel alloy for a low alloy, high
strength carbide-free bainitic steel which is tenacious and wear resistant for
producing strips, sheets and pipes, which on one hand is more cost effective than the
known steel alloys and on the other hand ensures uniform material properties which
meet the demands such as strength, elongation at break, tenacity etc. In addition,
these material properties are also to be achieved when cooling at stationary air by air
hardening.
[0021]                      This object is solved based on the preamble of claim 1 together with the
characterizing features. Advantageous refinements are the subject matter of the sub
claims.

           martensite and lamallae of ferrite and residual austenite with an average
           distance of the residual austenite lamellae being less than 750 nm.

[0023]                      Optionally rare earths and reactive elements such as Ce, Hf, La, Re, Sc
and/or Y of a\overall up to 1 weight % can be added.
[0024]                      In the puddle lump or slab state, steels according to the invention have
already after cooling at air a strength (Rm) of over 1250 MPa, an elongation at break
of over 12% and a tenacity (KBZ) at -20*C of at least 15 J (cf. Table 1). The
microstructure consists of carbide-free bainite and residual austenite with a
proportion of at least 75% bainitic ferrite, at least 10 % residual austenite and up to
maximally 5% martensite (or martensite phase and/or decomposed austenite).
[0025]                      The steel alloy according to the invention is based on the development
of the carbide-free bainitic steel form DE 6906 953 T2 and WO 2009/075494 Al.
[0026]                      Tests that were carried out in the context of the present invention have
surprisingly shown that compared to known steel alloys for achieving the demanded
material properties already can be achieved by an air hardening by targeted addition
of aluminum in the range of 0.05 to 3.0 weight % and niobium in the range of 0.001 to
0.5 weight % beside an excellent material strength and wear resistance, very good
tenacity can be achieved. In particular, the addition of niobium results in a significant
improvement of the tenacity properties through grain refinement, so that this alloy
meets the high requirements regarding mechanical properties and wear resistance.
[0027]                      Also, as a result of the advantageous addition of chromium in the range
of 0.10 to 2.00 weight %, the kinetic of the ferrite formation can be decisively
controlled so that the formation of coarse polygonal ferrite bodies, which can
adversely affect the material properties, can be effectively avoided. Important in this
regard is the interaction between aluminum                        and chromium. While aluminum
accelerates the ferritic and bainitic transformation, addition of chromium delays the
ferritic transformation (cf. Figure 2). Targeted combination of these two elements,

                                                             7
allows controlling the kinetic of the ferrite and bainite formation.
[0028]                      Beside the known advantageous effect of adding aluminum on avoiding
carbide precipitations in the bainite, tests have shown that the addition of aluminum
compared                 to       silicone   significantly accelerates  the  kinetic of the  bainitic
transformation. The latter also increases with increasing contents of aluminum which
mean that the tenacity and strength of the steel according to the invention is
significantly improved after continuous cooling compared to steel which are only
alloyed with silicone, i.e., higher tenacity and strength values can be achieved.
Advantageous are cooling rates greater than 100C/s in order to achieve the
demanded combination of mechanical properties also in thicker sheets (for example
above 10 mm); the demanded mechanical properties can also be achieved by means
of cooling at stationary air in the case of thinner sheets or by adjusting the alloying
concept. The influence of different alloying elements on the kinetic of the
transformation is shown in Figure 2. The effects of C, Si, Al, Mn, Cr and Mo on the
transformation kinetic of ferrite, perlite and bainite and on the martensite start
temperature are shown schematically.
[0029]                      According to the invention, compared to the known steel, it is strictly
necessary for achieving these advantageous properties that the nitrogen content
does not exceed the stated upper limit of 0.025%, better 0.015% or optimally 0.010
weight % in order to minimize the number and size of the deleterious aluminum
nitrides as primary precipitations in the steel, wherein in addition the condition Al x N
< 5 x 10-3 has to be satisfied. Otherwise, a minimal content of nitrogen of 0.001
weight %, optimally 0.0020 is required in order to enable a required niobium
carbonitride formation for increasing tenacity by grain refinement.
[0030]                      The       tested  alloy compositions    and  the determined   mechanical
characteristics are shown in Table 1. All samples where heated to about 9500C and
then cooled at stationary air or subjected to accelerated cooling. The required cooling
9991858 1 (GHMatters) P99274.AL.1

                                                         8
speed is selected depending on the sheet thickness and the composition. As the
results of the mechanical sampling show, the demanded properties could not be
achieved with the sample melt 14 due to the too low Cr content. The test melt 16
satisfied the demands due to the greater sheet thickness of 12 mm only after
accelerated cooling. Typical temperature profiles for the cooling at stationary air or
with quenching are shown in Figure 3.
[0031]                      In Figure 4 some of the tested test melts and their mechanical
characteristics and cooling conditions are shown in comparison to the conventional
and high strength steel materials. It can be seen that in the developed steel the
region of higher strength materials at improved stretch properties.
[0032]                      The results confirm the excellent mechanical properties (strength and
tenacity of the steel alloy according to the invention already for semi-finished
products such as puddle lumps or slabs) in the hardened state (Table 1).
[0033]                      As essential element, aluminum plays an important role which beside
accelerating the transformation kinetic also suppresses the carbide precipitation in
the bainite in combination with silicone, as a result, residual austenite is stabilized
because carbon only has a limited solubility in the ferrite. A high proportion of
residual austenite of at least 10% in the bainite causes beside the extremely fine
lamellar              microstructure     the   excellent   mechanical properties.  The    different
microstructure components were determined by scanning electron microscopy,
wherein a mean lamellar interspacing of 300 nm was determined. A schematic
representation of a previous austenite grain with substructure (such as for example
sub grains) with fine lamellar microstructure is schematically shown in figure 5. Here,
the previous austenite grain structure is stabilized via Nb(C,N) precipitations.

[0034]                      With corresponding proportions of residual austenite a so called TRIP
effect can then also be advantageously used. Steels which usually are referred to by
the term TRIP ("Transformation Induced Plasticity") are steels which at the same time
have a very high strength and a high ductility, which makes them especially suited for
cold forming. These properties are obtained owing to their special microscopic
structure, wherein the deformation-induced martensite formation and the work
hardening associated therewith is inhibited and the ductility is increased. The effect of
the TRIP effect is optimal for a residual austenite proportion of about 1 to 20%.
[0035]                      In the following, the alloying concept according to the invention is
explained in more detail.
       -     Carbon: for reason of sufficient strength of the material the minimal content
             should not be below 0.10 weight %. With regard to a sufficiently low martensite
             start temperature and with this the establishment of a very fine microstructure,
             however still good weldability, the carbon content should not be above 0.70
             weight %. Carbon contents between 0.15 and 0.60 weight % have proven
             advantageous, wherein optimal properties are achieved when the carbon
             content is between 0.18 and 0.50 weight %.
       -     Aluminum/silicone: the essential element for achieving the demanded material
             properties after continuous cooling is aluminum which strongly accelerates the
             transformation kinetic.
             In order to achieve this effect the aluminum content should be at leas 0.05%
             weight % but maximally 3.00% weight % because otherwise coarse polygonal
             ferrite bodies could form which in turn adversely affect the material properties.
             If the aluminum content is too low the bainitic transformation becomes too
             slow so that the formation of martensite is promoted which adversely affects
             the elongation at break and the notch impact toughness. For a sufficient
             suppression of carbides in the bainite, silicone at contents of 0.25 to 4.00
9991858 1 (GHMatters) P99274.AL.1

                                                  11
             weight % can be added. Good material properties are achieved at aluminum
             contents between 0.07 and 1.50 weight % and optimal ones between 0.09 and
             0.75 weight %. Corresponding silicone contents are between 0.50 to 1.75
             weight % or between 0.75 and 1.50 weight %.
             As a result of the targeted addition of chromium of at least 0.10 to 2.00 weight
             % the ferritic transformation can be decelerated and via a combination with
             aluminum the kinetic of the ferrite and bainite formation can be controlled in a
             targeted manner. Advantageous chromium contents are between 0.10 to 1.75
             weight % or between 0.10 and 1.50 weight %.
             Manganese: the addition of Manganese in the range of 1.00 to 3.00 weight %
             results in dependence on the respective demands on the steel alloy as a
             compromise between strength, which can be achieved by higher additions,
             and a sufficient tenacity which can be achieved at lower contents. With regard
             to a very good or optimal property combination, the manganese content
             should be between 1.50 and 2.50 weight % or between 1.70 and 2.70 weight
             Niobium/nitrogen: A niobium content of 0.001 to 0.50 weight % has to be
             established for ensuring formation of Nb(C,N). The resulting grain refinement
             contributes to a significant improvement of the tenacity properties. In addition
             a nitrogen content of 0.001 to 0.025 weight % is recommended for forming
             Nb(N) because NbN is more stable than NbC and thus leads to an increased
             grain refinement. Advantageous niobium contents are 0.001 to 0.10 or 0.001
             to 0.05 weight % at advantageous nitrogen contents of 0.001 to 0.015 or 0.002
             to 0.010 weight %. In addition, adding nitrogen prevents excessive binding of
             C via Nb because otherwise the austenite stabilizing effect of C could be lost.
             If needed for example molybdenum (up to 1.00 weight %), nickel (up to 5.00

             weight %) cobalt (up to 2.00 weight %) or wolfram (up tol.50 weight %) can be
             added as solid solution hardener for further increasing strength. As an
             alternative or in addition micro-alloying elements such as vanadium at up to
             0.2 weight % and/or titanium up to 0.10 weight % can be added. A total
             content of Ti, V of max 0.20 weight % and Ni, Mo, Co, W, Zr of max 5.50
             weight % should be observed. In order to take advantage of the effect of these
             alloy elements, a minimal content of 0.01 weight % should be observed.
             Rare earths and reactive elements: rare earths and reactive elements such as
             Ce, Hf, La, Re, Sc and/or Y can be optionally added to achieve an optimal
             lamellar interspacing and thus for further increase of strength and tenacity at
             total contents of up to 1 weight %. If necessary a total content of 20 ppm
             should be added.
[0036]                      In the alloy composition the following conditions should be adhered to
for achieving the demanded material properties in particular of the mechanical
technological properties for the transformation                     kinetic and the transformation
behavior (Figure 2) the stabilizing of the residual austenite and the martensite start
temperature while taking the cooling rate into account wherein in the mentioned
empirically determined formulas the contents of C, Mn, Si, Al, Cr and Mo in weight %
and Tas cooling rate in                 OC/s have to be inserted. The units of the coefficients that are
used in the formula are to be selected according to the variables used in the formula.
[0037]                      Kinetic of the ferritic transformation:
For adhering to or setting the mechanical-technical properties and in particular for
avoiding the formation of the coarse polygonal ferrite grains which adversely affect
the material properties, the following condition has to be satisfied:
(35 x C) + (10 x Mn) -Si                 - (5 x Al) + Cr > 134/T+ 10
[0038]                      Kinetic of the bainitic transformation:

                                                          13
The following equation for the kinetic of the bainitic transformation has to be
established to achieve a suitable microstructure with very finely configured bainitic
ferrite/residual austenite lamellae for the mechanical technological properties:
400 x exp [(-7 xC) - (4 x Mn) + 8 Al + 3]/ T > 1
[0039]                      Martensite start temperature (0C):
for avoiding greater martensitic microstructure proportions which deteriorate the
mechanical technological properties the martensite start temperature has to be
determined as follows:
525 - (350 x C) - (45 x Mn) - (16 x Mo) - (5 x Si) + (15 Al) << 400
[0040]                      For stabilizing the residual austenite, formation of cementite has to be
suppressed. This is achieved by a targeted alloying with Si and Al because both
elements have a very low solubility in cementite. For this, the following condition has
to be satisfied:
Si + Al > 43 x C
[0041]                      For avoiding deleterious primary AIN precipitations, the following
condition has to be satisfied:
Al x N > 5 x 10-3
In Figure 6, this relationship is again shown schematically.
[0042]                      Transformation capacity:
For establishing the properties according to the invention on the basis of the describe
microstructure a complete austeniziation of the steels according to the invention has
to be achieved prior to the final heat treatment (cf. Figure 1).
[0043]                      In order to achieve the demanded combination of the mechanical
properties (strength ductility and tenacity) the following relationship of the ferrite and
austenite formers is to be satisfied:

C+Si/6+Mn/4+(Cr+Mo)/3>1.
[0044]                      The microstructure of the steel according to the invention consist of
ferrite and residual austenite lamellae. It can have proportions of martensite of up to
5% (or martensite/austenite phase and/or decomposed austenite). The two most
important characteristics of the microstructure which significantly influence the
mechanical properties of the steel are the lamella spacing and the proportion of
residual austenite. The smaller the lamellar interspacing and the higher the
proportion of residual austenite the higher are the strength and elongation at break of
the material.
[0045]                      In order to achieve the demanded high strength of the material of at
least 1250 to 2500 MPa the average lamellar interspacing should be smaller than
750 nm, advantageously smaller than 500 nm.
[0046]                      In order to achieve the stretch values of at least 12% (and elongation at
break) a residual austenite proportion of at least 10% and a martensite proportion of
at most 5% should be present.
[0047]                      In order to achieve the high tenacity by grain refinement by means of
niobium carbonitride formation, the average previous austenite grain size should not
exceed a value of 100 pm.
[0048]                      Because the microstructure is very fine, the components of the
microstructure can hardly be distinguished from each other microscopically so that
depending on the case a combination of electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction
has to be used.
[0049]                      The components of the microstructure can be distinguished by means
of scanning electron microscopy. In this way, an average lamellar interspacing of

about 300 nm was determined.
[0050]                      The result of an x-ray diffraction measurement is shown in Figure 7.
From the intensity distribution of the x-ray spectrum, the crystal structure of the
present microstructure components and their phase proportions can be determined.
[0051]                      Residual austenite proportions between 10% and 20% were determined
using the x-ray diffraction method.
