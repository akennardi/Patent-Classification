                            A BASKET SUPPORT SYSTEM
[001] Field of the Invention
[002] The present invention relates to a basket support system. In particular the
present invention relates to a basket support system for supporting a washing basket,
which is effective for supporting heavy loads, can be used in diminishing lighting
conditions and is aesthetically pleasing.
[003] The invention has been developed primarily for use in/with a washing basket
support and system, and will be described hereinafter with reference to this
application.    However, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to this
particular field of use.
[004] Background of the Invention
[005] When a person finishes a load of clothes washing, it is not unusual to
subsequently take the wet load, which can weigh 20kg, to a clothesline for hanging
and drying. The washed clothes are usually transported to the clothesline in a basket
and the basket of washing placed on the ground in the vicinity of the line whereby the
person repeatedly bends over to pick up wet washing for hanging on the clothesline.
The repetitive nature of hanging out washed clothes is tedious and can result in back
strain injury if not aggravating an existing back injury.
[006] Some attempts have been made to address the above however such devices
have included multi-component devices which are expensive and labor intensive in
manufacturing, or cumbersome to use and not very aesthetic in appearance.
Alternatively, devices have been used which are not sufficiently sturdy to withstand
the weight of a basket of wet washing and tend to deform or break.
[007] In view of the above, it is desirable to have an improved means that addresses
and ameliorates at least one or more of the prior art deficiencies or at least provides a
practical variation to avert from one of more of the prior art deficiencies.
[008] It is to be understood that, if any prior art information is referred to herein, such
reference does not constitute an admission that the information forms part of the
common general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country.

                                             2
[009] Summary of Invention
[0010] According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a basket
support system for mounting on a clothesline or other support structure, the basket
support comprising: a mast attachable to the clothesline or support structure by
releasable fastening means; a boom pivotally mounted to a portion of the mast,
wherein the boom is movable relative to the mast between a stored position and an

platform locatable on the mounting portion of the boom for receiving a basket thereon;
and a storage means on or in the mast and/or boom for receiving the support platform
when the boom is in a storage condition.
[0011] The present invention represents an advance over prior art devices as it allows
stable support for a basket, including a washing basket carrying a load of washing, at
a height to substantially obviate the need for repeated back bending to select washing
for hanging on a line, and provides an aesthetic finish when not in use.
[0012] Throughout the specification and claims the term 'basket' means a carrier for
articles such as washing articles, clothing and the like and can include a peg holder or
bag.
[0013] The mast can include a longitudinal structure having a spine with first and
seconds ends, dependent wall portions, and a partially open front, wherein the spine,
side walls and open front define a sleeve for receiving the boom in a storage condition.
[0014] The boom preferably comprises an arm member having a complimentary
shape to the sleeve to allow movement of the boom relative to the mast between an
operating and storage condition.
[0015] Preferably the shape of the arm is square in vertical cross-section. Preferably
the boom is pivotally movable relative to the mast by a hinge mount in the mast. In an
operating condition, the mast can extend between a storage condition in which the
mast is retained in a substantially upright position within the sleeve of the mast and an
operating condition in which the arm is substantially perpendicular to the mast.
[0016] The basket support platform can include a plurality of elongate support
members releasably mounted on a mounting portion of the arm in spaced apart
relation, wherein the support members extend substantially at 90 degrees to the arm
