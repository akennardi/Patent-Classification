                                           ABSTRACT
A fiber optic cable assembly includes leg assemblies, a trunk assembly, a splice assembly, and a
furcation assembly. Each leg assembly includes a jacket, an optical fiber, strength members, and
a connector. The trunk assembly includes a jacket, optical fibers, strength members, and a multi
fiber connector. The splice assembly includes a tube supporting the optical fibers of the leg and
trunk assemblies that are spliced together. The furcation assembly is attached to the splice
assembly and includes a fan-out structure and first and second locks. The first lock binds the
strength members of the leg assemblies to the furcation assembly, and the second lock binds the
strength members of the trunk to the furcation assembly. As such, the furcation assembly
provides a mechanical linkage between the trunk and leg assemblies to strain relieve the spliced
optical fibers in the tube.

                             FIBER OPTIC CABLE ASSEMBLY
                                     RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]     The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent Application
No. 2014216530, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                           BACKGROUND
[0002]    Aspects of the present disclosure relate generally to fiber optic cable assemblies. More
specifically, aspects of the present disclosure relate to a robust cable assembly that includes a
trunk cable joined with a plurality of leg cables.
[0003]    Cable assemblies may be used to branch optical fibers from a trunk cable to a plurality
of leg cables. However, manufacture of cable assemblies may be cumbersome. For example,
optical fibers of the trunk cable are typically individually routed through furcation tubes that
become the leg cables, which may be particularly time-consuming. Connectors are then
attached, often manually, to distal ends of the leg cables. Further, cable assemblies may be less
robust than the associated cables. For example, reinforcement components of the cables may
simply be glued to the assemblies, where the pull-out strength of the individual leg cables is
directly related to the strength of the glue, as opposed to the reinforcement components of the leg
cables. A need exists for a robust cable assembly that may be efficiently manufactured.
[0004]     A reference herein to a patent document or any other matter identified as prior art, is
not to be taken as an admission that the document or other matter was known or that the
information it contains was part of the common general knowledge as at the priority date of any
of the claims.

                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[002631]     Before turning to the Figures, which illustrate exemplary embodiments now
described in detail, it should be understood that the present inventive and innovative technology
is not limited to the details or methodology set forth in the Detailed Description or illustrated in
the Figures. For example, as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, features and
attributes associated with embodiments shown in one of the Figures may be applied to
embodiments shown in others of the Figures.
[002732]     Referring to FIG. 1, a fiber optic cable assembly 110 includes leg assemblies 112, a
trunk assembly 114, a splice assembly 116, and a furcation assembly 118. According to an
exemplary embodiment, as shown in FIG. IB, each leg assembly 112 includes a jacket 120, an
optical fiber 122, strength members 124, and a connector 126. In some embodiments, the jacket
120 of the leg assembly 112 is a polymeric jacket, such as including polyvinyl chloride, medium
or high-density polyethylene, fire-retardant additives, carbon black, and/or other materials. As
shown in FIG. IB, the jacket 120 is round in cross-section and has a diameter of less than 10
mm, such as less than 8 mm, allowing the leg assembly 112 to maneuver in narrower ducts
without preferential bending. In other embodiments, the jacket 120 is otherwise shaped. The leg
assemblies 112 may include a buffer tube surrounding the optical fiber 122, partitioning the
optical fiber 122 from the strength members 124 interior to the jacket 120.
[002833]     In some embodiments, the optical fiber 122 of the leg assembly 112 is a high
performance optical fiber, such as a bend-insensitive optical fiber. For example, when wrapped
one turn around a 10 mm diameter mandrel, the optical fiber 122 exhibits a bend-induced change
in optical attenuation of less than 0.5 dB at an 850 nm wavelength, such as less than 0.4 dB, such
as less than 0.25 dB. High performing optical fibers, such as CLEARCURVE TM fibers
manufactured by Corning Incorporated of Coming, New York, allow the leg assembly 112 to be
easily routed into and through equipment, ducts, and elsewhere. The optical fiber 122 may be a
single-mode optical fiber, a multi-mode optical fiber, a multi-core optical fiber, tight-buffered
optical fibers, and/or another type of optical fiber. In some embodiments, each leg assembly 112
may include more than one optical fiber 122, such as two optical fibers each or other numbers of
optical fibers.
                                                  -5 -

 [002934]    According to an exemplary embodiment, the connector 126 of the leg assembly 112
supports (i.e., uses, incorporates) the optical fiber 122. For example, the optical fiber 122 may
be cleaved, fixed to a ferrule of the connector 126, laser- or machine-polished/shaped, and
protected in a rugged, weatherproof connector housing (as shown in FIG. 1). In some
embodiments, the connector 126 is an SC-type connector, in other embodiments the connector
 126 is an LC-type (duplex) connector, and in still other embodiments the connector 126 is an
MPO-type connector. In contemplated embodiments, other types of connectors 126 are used.
The connector 126 may be a single-fiber connector or a multi-fiber connector.
 [00305]    Still referring to FIG. 1, the trunk assembly 114 includes a jacket 128, optical fibers
 130, strength members 132, and a multi-fiber connector 134. Similar to the jacket 120 of the leg
assemblies 112, in some embodiments the jacket 128 of the trunk assembly 114 is a polymeric
jacket, such as including polyvinyl chloride, medium- or high-density polyethylene, fire
retardant additives, carbon black, and/or other materials. The jacket 128 of the trunk assembly
 114 may have flat exterior sides, as shown in FIG. IB, or may be round or otherwise shaped.
 [00316]    According to an exemplary embodiment, the jacket 128 of the trunk assembly 114
forms an interior cavity 133 within which the optical fibers 130 are positioned. The cavity 133
may be rectangular to guide movement of the optical fibers 130 as the trunk assembly 114 bends,
such as where the optical fibers 130 are loosely positioned in the cavity 133 without a buffer
tube. In other embodiments, buffer tubes and/or strength members (e.g., aramid) may be
positioned in the cavity 133. The cable of the trunk assembly as shown in FIG. 1A, including the
jacket 128, strength members 132, and optical fibers 130, as well as the cable of the leg
assemblies as shown in FIG. IB, including the jacket 120, strength members 124, and optical
fiber 122, may be a gel-filled cable, where a petroleum-based gel or other filler surrounds the
optical fibers 122, 130 for water-blocking and coupling of the optical fibers 122, 130 to the
respective cables; or the cables may be gel-free ("diy"), including a super-absorbent powder,
which may be positioned in open spaces of the cables, alone or integrated with yarn, and used to
expand when exposed to water, to block flow of the water through the respective cable.
 [00327]    Although shown as having a relatively short length between the splice assembly 116
and the connector 134 in FIG. 1, in contemplated embodiments the trunk assembly 114 may be
                                                   -6-

significantly longer than the leg assemblies 122, such as five or even ten times longer or more.
For example, the trunk assemblies 114 may span a large distance, such as portion of an outdoor
communications antenna, while the leg assemblies 112 may extend into antenna equipment.
According to an exemplary embodiment, the trunk assembly 114 includes an aerial cable
between the splice assembly 116 and the connector 134 that is self-supporting along a span of at
least 50 meters under National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) light-loading conditions at 1%
installation sag, such as at least 60 meters, and/or at least 75 meters at 1% installation sag.
[00338]     In some embodiments, the optical fibers 130 are part of a fiber optic ribbon, such as a
side-by-side arrangement of a plurality of optical fibers bound to one another by a common
matrix (e.g., ultra-violet cured acrylate). In some embodiments, the fiber optic ribbon is a
twelve-fiber ribbon, a four-fiber ribbon, a six-fiber ribbon, a twelve-fiber ribbon. In some
embodiments, the trunk cable includes a stack of ribbons. In other embodiments, the optical
fibers 130 of the trunk assembly 114 are loosely arranged therein, and may be located in one or
more buffer tubes. The buffer tubes may be gel-filled or gel-free. According to an exemplary
embodiment, the number of leg assemblies of the cable assembly is a multiple of the number of
optical fibers in the trunk assembly. Like the leg assembly, the individual optical fibers of the
trunk assembly may be single-mode, multi-mode, multi-core, tight-buffered optical fibers, bend
insensitive, or other types of optical fibers.
[00349]     According to an exemplary embodiment, the multi-fiber connector 134 of the trunk
assembly 114 supports (i.e., uses, incorporates) some or all of the optical fibers 130 of the trunk
assembly 114. For example, the optical fiber 122 may be cleaved together in the multi-fiber
connector 134, fixed to a ferrule of the connector 134, laser- or machine-polished/shaped, and
protected in a rugged, weatherproof connector housing (as shown in FIG. 1). In some
embodiments, the multi-fiber connector 134 is an MPO-type connector, such as an MTP@
connector manufactured by US Conec Ltd of Hickory, North Carolina. In contemplated
embodiments, another type of connector is used.
[003540]     Referring to FIGS. 1 and 11-12, according to an exemplary embodiment, the optical
fibers 122, 130 of the leg and trunk assemblies 112, 114 are spliced together at splice points 164.
The optical fibers 122, 130 are preferably fusion spliced together but may be otherwise spliced.
                                                 -7-

The splice assembly includes 116 a tube 136 (FIG. 12) sized to support a plurality of spliced
optical fibers 122, 130 of the leg and trunk assemblies 112, 114. In some embodiments, the tube
136 is elongate, having a length L of at least ten times the average width W thereof. The tube
may be cylindrical or otherwise shaped and may be formed from a polymer, such as a clear
plastic. In contemplated embodiments, multiple overlapping tubes are used, where the innermost
tube supports the spliced optical fibers, and epoxy or another filler may be used to fill space
between the innermost tube and one or more tubes exterior thereto (essentially providing a
thicker composite tube). Splice protectors, such as UV-cured acrylate encapsulant and/or splints,
may be used to reinforce the splice points 164.
[003641]     According to an exemplary embodiment, the interior of the tube 136, in some
embodiments, is left with open space (e.g., at least 50% of the interior volume is air) and the tube
136 serves to isolate the spliced optical fibers 122, 130 from other parts of the cable assembly
110, such as the encapsulant 138 as shown in FIG. 14 and discussed below, and the strength
members 132, 140 as shown in FIG. 15. The open space in the tube 136 allows the spliced
optical fibers 122, 130 to move within the tube 136, such as moving to a neutral axis as the cable
assembly 110 bends, or to translate within the tube 136 to accommodate strain on either the trunk
or leg assemblies 114, 112.
[003742]     According to an exemplary embodiment, the optical fibers 122, 130 in the tube 136
have excess length relative to the length L of the tube 136 (e.g., at least 0.5% longer, at least
1.5% longer), which allows the tube 136 to stretch without straining the spliced optical fibers
122, 130, such as if the cable assembly 110 is axially loaded in tension. Also, contraction of the
cable assembly 110, such as in cold weather, has little to no impact on the spliced optical fibers
122, 130 within the tube 136, which are free to bend and buckle in the open space of the tube 136
of the splice assembly 116. In other contemplated embodiment, the tube 136 is filled with a
potting material, such as epoxy, which may further protect the spliced fibers 122, 130 therein by
encapsulation and/or improve the weather-ability of the cable assembly 110.
[003843]     Splicing the optical fibers 122 of the individual leg assemblies 112 to the plurality of
optical fibers 130 of the trunk assembly 114, instead of using continuous optical fibers running
from the trunk assembly 114 to form the optical fibers of the leg assemblies 112, allows for use
                                                  -8-

of pre-terminated pigtails (i.e., short lengths of cable with connectorized ends) that have been
separately pre-assembled, such as by an automated process. In other contemplated
embodiments, one or more of the optical fibers 122 of the leg assemblies 112 are direct
continuations of optical fibers 130 of the trunk assembly 114, not spliced thereto.
[003944]     Referring now to FIGS. 1-10, the furcation assembly 118 is attached to the splice
assembly 116 (see FIGS. 1 and 12) and includes a fan-out structure 142 and first and second
locks 144, 146. The fan-out structure includes openings 158 for receiving individual leg
assemblies 112. In some embodiments, the furcation assembly 118 further includes a funnel 160
that connects to or is integrally formed with the fan-out structure 142 to direct the optical fibers
122 of the leg assemblies 112 toward the splice assembly 116 and/or to support attachment of the
splice assembly 116 to the furcation assembly 118.
[00405]    Some or all of the openings 158 of the fan-out structure 142 may be used, depending
upon the number of leg assemblies 112 of the particular cable assembly 110. For example, one
fan-out structure 142 may support three leg assemblies 112, while another supports six leg
assemblies 112. Also, the openings 158 may be tiered or tapered lengthwise therethrough, such
as by having a stair-step profile, which allows different jacket 120 sizes to be inserted into the
same fan-out structure 142. In some embodiments, different size leg assemblies 112 may be
used with the same furcation assembly 118 (e.g., wider and narrower jackets 120; differently
shaped jackets 120, 220). For example, a hybrid cable assembly, as discussed below, may
include both wider leg assemblies 112 that support conductive members and narrower leg
assemblies 112 that support optical fibers 122.
[00416]    The first lock 144 binds the strength members 124 of the leg assemblies 112 to the
furcation assembly 118, and the second lock 146 binds the strength members 132 of the trunk
114 to the furcation assembly 118. As such, the furcation assembly 118 provides a robust
mechanical linkage between the trunk and leg assemblies 112, 114 to strain relieve the spliced
optical fibers 122, 132 in the tube 136. According to an exemplary embodiment, while fixing the
multi-fiber connector 134 of the trunk assembly 114 and pulling one connector 126 of the leg
assemblies 112, the cable assembly 110 can support at least 50 lbf of pulling force ), such as at
least 100 lbf or even at least about 150 lbf of pulling force, without permanently damaging the
                                                  -9-

cable assembly 110, such as (i) without pulling out of the leg assembly 112 from the furcation
assembly 118, (ii) without pulling the trunk assembly 114 apart from the splice assembly 116,
(iii) without fracturing of the optical fibers 122, 132 of the trunk or leg assemblies 114, 112,
and/or (iv) without severing the splice of the spliced optical fibers 122, 132 in the tube 136 of the
splice assembly 116.
[00427]    According to an exemplary embodiment, the strength members 124 of the leg
assemblies 112 are loose strength members (e.g., not bound together in a cured matrix) in the
form of fibrous strength members that provide tensile strength to the leg assemblies 112.
According to an exemplary embodiment, the strength members 124 of the leg assemblies 112
include tensile fibers, such as dielectric aramid and/or fiberglass fibers. The fibrous strength
members 124 may be arranged as yarns of such tensile fibers; which may, in some embodiments,
be stranded around the optical fibers 122.
[00438]    According to an exemplary embodiment, the strength members 132 of the trunk
assembly 114 are rigid strength members in the form of rod strength members (e.g., beams, rigid
wires) that provide anti-buckling support for the trunk assembly 114 as well as tensile
reinforcement to the trunk assembly 114. In some embodiments, the strength members 132 of
the trunk assembly 114 include metallic rods or dielectric, glass-reinforced plastic rods.
[00449]    In contemplated embodiments, strength member of the leg assemblies 112 (cf. trunk
assembly 114) are rigid strength members, or include rigid strength members. For example, in
contemplated embodiments, one or more of the leg assemblies 112 may include a cross-section
similar to the cross-section of the trunk assembly 114 shown in FIG. 1A, except with a fewer
number of the optical fibers 122 than the trunk assembly 114. In contemplated embodiments,
strength member of the trunk assembly 114 are loose strength members, or include loose strength
members. For example, in contemplated embodiments, the trunk assembly may include a cross
section similar to the cross-section of the leg assembly 112 shown in FIG. IB, except with a
greater number of optical fibers 130 than the leg assembly 112. In some such embodiments, the
trunk assembly 114 may include a central strength member (e.g., rigid strength member, rod
strength member), and buffer tubes including groups of optical fibers (e.g., twelve per tube) may
                                                 - 10 -

be stranded about the central strength member. The trunk cable assembly may include armor,
such as wrapped metal tape or extruded dielectric armor (e.g., tough polyvinyl chloride).
[004550]     Referring to FIGS. 1 and 9-15, the furcation assembly 118 is attached to the splice
assembly 116 on an end of the tube 136. Further, as mentioned above, the furcation assembly
118 includes the fan-out structure 142 through which optical fibers 122 of leg assemblies 112
may extend, as shown in FIG. 10. The first lock 144 of the furcation assembly 118, as shown in
FIG. 9-10, is configured to bind fibrous strength members of the leg assemblies 112. The second
lock 146, as shown in FIG.S 14-15, is configured to bind rigid strength members 140, which may
be crimped, such as with metallic crimp sleeves, or otherwise fastened to the rigid strength
members 132 of the trunk assembly 114. As such, the furcation assembly 118 is configured to
provide a mechanical linkage between the fibrous and rigid strength members 124, 132.
[004651]     Referring more specifically to the first lock 144 as shown in FIGS. 9-10, in some
embodiments the furcation assembly 118 includes an end piece 148, such as a plate, guide,
and/or washer. The end piece 148 and the fan-out structure 142 include a passage 166 for receipt
of a threaded fastener 150. Accordingly, the fastener 150 (FIG. 10) can be used to compress the
end piece 148 toward the fan-out structure 142, such as with fibrous strength members 124 of the
leg assemblies 112 clamped therebetween, locking the fibrous strength members 124 of the leg
assemblies 112 to the furcation assembly 118.
[004752]     In other contemplated embodiments, the fibrous strength members 124 are drawn
forward through the fan-out structure 142 and clamped on a side of the fan-out structure 142
between the fan-out structure 142 and the tube 136 of the splice assembly 116. In still other
contemplated embodiments, the fibrous strength members 124 may be clamped directly to the
rigid strength members 140 or 132, and/or wrapped around and/or epoxied thereto. In some
embodiments, the leg assemblies 112 are adhered to the furcation assembly 118, such as with
epoxy or another adhesive. The threaded fastener 150 may also be used to fasten a loop 156
(FIG. 1) or hook to the cable assembly 110 for hauling the cable assembly 110, such as vertically
up an antenna tower.

 [004853]   Referring more specifically to the second lock 146, as shown in FIGS. 14-15, in
some embodiments the furcation assembly 118 includes ports 152 for receiving rigid strength
members 140. The ports 152 may include grooves extending along an exterior surface of the
fan-out structure 142, as shown in FIGS. 4-9. In other embodiments, the ports 152 may include
holes in the fan-out structure 142. According to an exemplary embodiment, the strength
members 140 lock into the furcation assembly 118 with a cap 154 (FIG. 13) or bump/stop (e.g.,
crimp sleeve) integrated with the strength members 140 that is too wide to allow the strength
members 140 to pull out of or backward through the port 152. In some embodiments the
strength members 140 are adhered to the furcation assembly 118.
 [004954]   Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 16-18, according to an exemplary embodiment the
cable assembly 110 is overmolded, such as with a polymeric encapsulant 138. The polymeric
encapsulant 138 provides a water-impermeable barrier to the cable assembly 110 and/or
improves the robustness of the cable assembly 110. In some embodiments, the encapsulant 138
is polyurethane. According to an exemplary embodiment, the encapsulant 138 fully surrounds
the splice assembly 116 and the furcation assembly 118. FIG. 16 shows the mold 162, FIG. 17
shows the mold 162 opened, and FIG. 18 shows the encapsulated cable assembly 110.
According to an exemplary embodiment, the polymeric encapsulant 138 does not penetrate the
tube 136 of the splice assembly 116, and accordingly does not fill the open space therein.
 [00505]   In other contemplated embodiments, one or more heat-shrink tubes or wraps are used
in place of or in conjunction with the overmolded encapsulant 138 (e.g., underneath the
encapsulant 138; over lengthwise end-portions of the encapsulant 138, extending over adjoining
jackets 128, 120). Furthermore, seals, sealants, and gaskets may be used between the leg,
furcation, splice, and trunk assemblies 112, 114, 116, 118 to prevent or mitigate leakage of
water, encapsulant (e.g., epoxy, polyurethane), or other liquids between or around components of
the assemblies 112, 114, 116, 118.
 [00516]   According to an exemplary embodiment, the overmolded portion 138 of the cable
assembly 110 has a particularly low-profile, allowing the cable assembly 110 to be maneuvered
through narrow ducts and openings in equipment. For example, in some embodiments, the
overmolded portion 138 of the cable assembly 110 has a length that is at least ten times the
                                               - 12 -

average width thereof and/or at least five times the maximum width thereof, such as at least
fifteen times the average width thereof and/or at least ten times the maximum width thereof. In
some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 1, the overmolded portion 138 of the cable assembly 110
has a particularly narrow profile such that the overmolded portion 138 of the cable assembly 110
is no wider than the widest of the connectors 126 of the leg assemblies 112 and/or the multi-fiber
connector 134 of the trunk assembly 114. In other contemplated embodiments, the overmolded
portion 138 of the cable assembly 110 has a profile such that the overmolded portion 138 of the
cable assembly 110 is no wider than three-times, two-times, and/or 1.5 times the widest of the
connectors 126 of the leg assemblies 112 and/or the multi-fiber connector 134 of the trunk
assembly 114
[00527]     Referring now to FIG. 19, a cable assembly 210, similar to the cable assembly 110,
includes leg assemblies 212, a trunk assembly 214, a splice assembly 216, and a furcation
assembly 218. Each leg assembly 212 includes a jacket 220, an optical fiber 222, and strength
members 224. The trunk assembly 214 includes a jacket 228, optical fibers 230, and strength
members 232. In some embodiments, the trunk and/or the leg assemblies 212, 214 may include
connectors on distal ends thereof, as shown with the cable assembly 110. The splice assembly
216 includes a tube 236 where the optical fibers 222, 230 of the leg and trunk assemblies 212,
214 are spliced together. The furcation assembly 218 is attached to the splice assembly 216 and
includes first and second locks 244, 246.
[00538]     Different than the cable 110, the leg assemblies 212 of the cable 210 include flat, drop
cables, such as SST DROPTM or ROC DROPTM cables manufactured by Coming Cable Systems
LLC of Hickory, North Carolina. As such, the strength members 224 of the leg assemblies 212
are rigid strength members. As shown in FIG. 19, each leg assembly 212 includes at least two
rigid strength members 224, and rigid strength members 224 from adjoining leg assemblies 212
in the furcation assembly 218 are mechanically crimped together to form the first lock 244,
which binds the strength members 224 of the leg assemblies 212 to the furcation assembly 218.
[00549]     According to an exemplary embodiment, the trunk assembly 214 may be a flat
distribution cable, such as an RPXTM cable manufactured by Coming Cable Systems LLC of
Hickory, North Carolina. According to an exemplary embodiment, the trunk assembly 214
                                                 - 13 -

includes access features 260 in the jacket 228 thereof, such as discontinuities of material (e.g.,
polypropylene) co-extruded into the jacket 228 (e.g., polyethylene) that facilitate tearing open of
the jacket 228 to access the strength members 232 and the optical fibers 230 therein. The torn
open jacket 228 may then be cut away and the strength members 232 of the trunk assembly 214
may then locked directly to the furcation assembly 218, without intermediate strength members
140. In other contemplated embodiments, the strength members 232 of the trunk cable 214
extend through the interior of the tube 236 of the splice assembly 216 to fasten to the furcation
assembly 218 and/or are fibrous strength members.
[005560]     Referring generally to FIGS. 1 and 19, in contemplated embodiments the trunk cable
assembly 114, 224 may include a hybrid cable (also called composite cable) having both optical
fibers 122 and conductive elements (e.g., stranded copper wires). The optical fibers 122, 222
may be spliced, with the spliced connections located in a splice assembly 116, and the
conductive elements may be electrically connected to conductive elements in one or more leg
assemblies 122 in the splice assembly 16. In some such embodiments, some of the leg
assemblies 122 include only optical fibers 122 while others include only electrical conductors.
In other such embodiments, some of the leg assemblies 112 include both optical fibers 122 and
electrical conductors. Embedded strength members 224 may be used as electrical conductors.
For example, the embedded strength members 224 may include co-axial components, such as a
steel core surrounded by a more-conductive copper layer.
[005661]     Referring to FIG. 20, technology disclosed herein may also be used with cable
assemblies in the form of harness assemblies, such as a harness assembly 310 that include
multiple leg assemblies 312, 314 on different sides of a splice assembly 316. For example, a
tube 336 of the splice assembly 316 may be adjoined on ends thereof with furcation assemblies
318, 362, similar to the furcation assembly 118. According to an exemplary embodiment,
strength members of the leg assemblies 312, 314 on both sides of the harness assembly 310 may
be locked to the furcation assemblies 318, 362 by any of the various mechanisms disclosed
herein. The number of leg assemblies 312 on one side of the harness assembly 310 may be
different than the number of leg assemblies 314 on the other side; however, according to an
exemplary embodiment, the total number of optical fibers 322, 330 (spliced together in the splice
                                                - 14 -

assembly 316) is the same on either side of the harness assembly 310. Each leg assembly 312,
314 may include a connector 334, 326. The harness assembly 310 maybe overmolded with an
encapsulant 338.
[005762]    The construction and arrangements of the cable assembly, as shown in the various
exemplary embodiments, are illustrative only. Although only a few embodiments have been
described in detail in this disclosure, many modifications are possible (e.g., variations in sizes,
dimensions, structures, shapes, and proportions of the various members, values of parameters,
mounting arrangements, use of materials, colors, orientations, etc.) without materially departing
from the novel teachings and advantages of the subject matter described herein. Some elements
shown as integrally formed may be constructed of multiple parts or elements, the position of
elements may be reversed or otherwise varied, and the nature or number of discrete elements or
positions may be altered or varied. For example, in at least one contemplated embodiment, the
furcation assembly 118 is not included, and the cable assembly 110 includes only one leg
assembly 112, such as where the cable assembly 110 may be used to convert one connector type
to another. The order or sequence of any process, logical algorithm, or method steps may be
varied or re-sequenced according to alternative embodiments. Other substitutions,
modifications, changes and omissions may also be made in the design, operating conditions and
arrangement of the various exemplary embodiments without departing from the scope of the
present inventive and innovative technology.
