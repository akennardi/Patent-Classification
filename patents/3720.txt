                               DESCRIPTION
              PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR INHIBITOR-1      INHIBITOR
         This application is a divisional of AU <removed-apn>, which is
a divisional of 2010231058, the entire contents of which are
incorporated herein by reference.
Technical Field
         The present invention relates to a novel compound
having plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (hereinafter referred to
as "PAI-1") inhibitory activity, and a PAI-1 inhibitor comprising
the compound as an active ingredient.      The present invention further
relates    to a pharmaceutical composition having an inhibitory action
on PAI-1 activity and being efficacious         in the prevention and
treatment of various diseases whose development is influenced by
PAI-1    activity.
Background Art
         Reference to any prior art    in the specification    is   not, and
should not be taken as, an acknowledgment,     or any form of suggestion,
that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in
Australia or any other jurisdiction or that this prior art could
reasonably be expected to be ascertained,        understood and regarded
as relevant by a person skilled in the art.
         Atrial thrombus caused by atrial fibrillation and thrombi
formed by the disruption of atheroma        (atherosclerotic vessels) in
the aorta or carotid artery may cause ischemic cerebrovascular
diseases such as cerebral embolism, cerebral infarction,          transient
ischemic attack, etc.,     and ischemic heart diseases such as angina
pectoris, myocardial infarction, atrial thrombus caused by atrial
fibrillation, cardiac insufficiency, etc. While blood circulation
must have good fluidity to deliver oxygen and nutrients to body
tissues and remove waste      (from the circulatory system),       it is
required to be coagulative to stop bleeding for the prevention of
blood loss due to injury. When the balance between such opposed
functions of fluidity and coagulation is lost and shifts to
1002007553

                                      - 1A
coagulation,       an intravascular thrombus is    formed, which is     thought
to cause ischemic cerebrovascular disorders and heart diseases.
         The fibrinolytic    system plays important roles in thrombolysis,
tissue    destruction and repair, cell     migration, etc. The fibrinolytic
system is activatedwhen plasminogen activator (hereinafter referred
to as "PA")       converts plasminogen to plasmin, whereas plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1         (PAI-l)
1002007553

                                      -2
    inhibits PA.
               Tissue plasminogen activator (hereinafter referred to
    as "t-PA") converts plasminogen, i.e.,      the precursor of plasmin,
    to plasmin.   Plasmin converts fibrin to a fibrin degradation
  5 product by breaking it down.
                PAI-1 is a serine protease inhibitor that specifically
    inhibits t-PA and urokinase plasminogen activator (hereinafter
    referred to as "u-PA"), suppresses plasmin generation, and as a
    result inhibits fibrin degradation.
10              Based on tertiary structural differences, PAI-1 is
    present in an active form that shows PA inhibitory activity and
    in a latent form that shows no PA inhibitory activity.
    In plasma, PAI-1 is known to be typically present in a
    concentration of 20 ng/mL, and produced in hepatocytes,
15  megakaryocytes and lipocytes in addition to the vascular
    endothelial cells, which are the primary PAI-1 producing cells.
                PAI-1 is an acute phase protein, and is thought to be
    one of the factors that cause ischemic organ dysfunctions in
    sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome (DIC)
20  through accelerated production due to various cytokines and
    growth factors.   Further,   genetic polymorphism due to single base
    substitutions in the PAI-1 gene promoter is known, and it has
    been revealed that plasma PAI-1 concentration increases as a
    result of such genetic polymorphism.
25              Furthermore, in diabetes mellitus, accelerating
    arteriosclerosis and microvascular complications are presumed to
    be factors in ischemic heart disease, diabetic retinopathy, and
    renal damage, i.e.,   all are critical complications of diabetes
    mellitus.   For example,  in  diabetic nephropathy,   increased
30   extracellular matrix in the glomerulus and fibrous stroma are
     observed characteristics, and PAI-1 expression is increased in
     the glomerulus and renal tubules.     In  proximal renal tubule
     incubation, increased PAI-1 production is evident under
     hyperglycemic conditions.    Further,   a correlation between PAI-1
 35  expression in renal tissues and macrophage infiltration is

                                     -3
    confirmed in experiments using a model mouse with renal
    interstitial fibrosis (see Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2).
               Furthermore, PAI-1 concentrations in urine are
    documented as being high in nephrotic syndrome patients based on
  5 the measurement results of PAI-1 levels in urine collected over a
    24-hour period from nephrotic syndrome patients    (see Non-Patent
    Document 3).
               As described above, deep involvement of PAI-1 in kidney
    diseases such as diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease
10  (CKD), nephrotic syndrome, post-renal kidney injury, and
    pyelonephritis has been extensively studied and reported (see
    Non-Patent Documents 4 to 8).   In  contrast thereto,  as a result of
    administrating an inactive PAI-1 mutant or t-PA as a PAI-1
    antagonist to a Thy-1 nephritis model, it is reported that the
15  alleviation of inflammation (cellular infiltration), TGF-P
    suppression, and a decrease in mesangial matrix are observed,
    whereby Thy-1 nephritis is alleviated (Non-Patent Documents 9 and
    10).
               Reduced fibrinolytic activity due to an increased PAI-1
20  concentration in plasma is associated with ischemic heart
    diseases such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, cardiac
    insufficiency; deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism
    originated therefrom; and diabetic angiopathy (for example, see
    Non-Patent Document   11). In addition to reduced fibrinolytic
25   activity, some other thrombogenic abnormalities including
    hypercoagulation and platelet hyper-aggregation are also seen in
     diabetic patients.  They are caused by microthrombus formation,
     and play important roles in the progression of diabetic
     microangiopathy and diabetic macroangiopathy.
 30             As described above, PAI-1 is presumably involved in the
     formation and progression of various pathological conditions of
     various diseases, specifically, various kinds of thrombosis,
     cancer, diabetes mellitus, ocular diseases such as glaucoma and
     retinopathy, polycystic ovary syndrome, radiation damage,
 35  alopecia (calvities), splenohepatomegaly, arteriosclerosis, etc.

                                       -4
    (see Non-Patent Documents    12 to 17).     In  addition,      PAI-1 is   also
    presumably involved in control of the circadian rhythm, which is
    presumed to be involved in the formation of vascular endothelial
    cells and the occurrence of events such as cerebral infarction
  5 and myocardial infarction    (Non-Patent Documents        18 to 20).      For
    this reason, a compound that inhibits PAI-1 activity is useful as
    a preventive and treatment agent for various diseases such as
    thrombosis, cancer, diabetes mellitus, diabetic complications,
    various kidney diseases, ocular diseases such as glaucoma and
10  retinopathy, polycystic ovary syndrome, alopecia, bone-marrow
    regeneration, splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis,
    amyloidosis, and arteriosclerosis (see Non-Patent Documents 21
    and 22).   In particular, Non-Patent Document 14 reports that PAI-1
    promotes angiogenesis in the retina, and a PAI-1 inhibitor is
15  therefore considered to be useful as an agent for preventing and
    treating retinopathy and various other diseases that occur in
    association with angiogenesis.      Further,     Non-Patent Document 23
    states that a low-molecular-weight PAI-1 inhibitor inhibits
    differentiation of adipose cells, thereby inhibiting the
20  development   of diet-induced obesity.      Therefore,     a PAI-1 inhibitor
    is presumably effective for preventing and treating obesity.
                Tissue fibril formation occurs in many tissues and
    organs such as the lungs, heart, blood vessels, liver, kidneys,
     etc.  A report has disclosed that the progression of pulmonary
25   fibrosis can be suppressed by the administration of a PA or PAI-1
     inhibitor to activate the fibrinolysis system (Non-Patent
     Document 24).   Therefore,  a PAI-1 inhibitor is       known to be
     effective for treating tissue fibrosis, in particular pulmonary
     fibrosis  (Non-Patent Documents 22,    25,    and 26).    However,     there is
 30  no drug available to treat    them radically.      In  reality,
     adrenocorticotropic hormones such as predonisolone,
     corticosteroid, etc.,   and cytotoxic drugs such as
     cyclophosphamide (alkylating agent) and azathioprine
     (antimetabolites, immunosuppressants) have been used as
 35  palliative therapy based on experience.

                                          -5
                    Further, it is believed that the onset of Alzheimer's
    disease is triggered by the accumulation of amyloid @ peptide
    (AP) in      the brain.   Therefore, current research and development of
    drugs for preventing or treating Alzheimer's disease has been
  5 conducted with a focus on suppressing the production of A@ or
    promoting decomposition of AB.         It was recently discovered that
    the decomposition of AP can be promoted by inhibiting PAI-1; this
    finding suggests that a PAI-1 inhibitor may be usable as a drug
    for treating Alzheimer's disease (Non-Patent Document 27).

                                 -7A
Summary of Invention
Technical Problem
         Urokinase, i.e., u-PA, is known as a fibrinolysis
1002007553

                                          -8
    promoter.  This drug is      obtained by the purification of human
    urine, and is not considered to be highly productive or safe.
    Moreover, urokinase is a high-molecular-weight compound having a
    molecular weight of about 54,000.        Other known fibrinolysis
 5  promoters include tisokinase, alteplase (gene recombinant),
    nasaruplase (cell culture), nateplase (gene recombinant),
    monteplase (gene recombinant), pamiteplase (gene recombinant),
    and batroxobin; however, they are all high-molecular-weight
    compounds.   Considering this      fact, a highly safe low-molecular
10  weight compound drug that can be synthesized in large amounts is
    in  demand as a fibrinolysis      promoter.  Also expected is the
    development of drugs efficacious in radically treating fibrous
    tissue and the alleviation thereof.
                In order to solve the foregoing problems, focus was
15  placed on PAI-1 that is involved in the inhibition of activation
    of the fibrinolytic system as well as the formation and
    progression of various pathological conditions such as various
    types of thrombosis; cancer; diabetes mellitus; diabetic
    complications such as macroangiopathy and microangiopathy; tissue
20  fibrosis such pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, and renal
     fibrosis; various kidney diseases such as diabetic nephropathy,
     chronic kidney disease (CKD), nephrotic syndrome, post-renal
     kidney injury, and pyelonephritis; ocular diseases such as
     glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and oxygen-induced retinopathy;
25   polycystic ovary syndrome; radiation damage; alopecia
     (calvities); splenohepatomegaly; bone-marrow regeneration;
     obesity; amyloidosis; Alzheimer's disease; and arteriosclerosis.
     With that focus, the present invention aims to provide a highly
     safe pharmaceutical composition that has an inhibitory action on
 30  the PAI-1 and contains, as an active component, a low-molecular
     weight that can be synthesized in       large amounts.  More
     specifically, the present invention aims to provide a
     pharmaceutical composition that is useful as fibrinolysis
     promoter as an anti-thrombogenic agent or a thrombolytic agent;
 35  cancer progression inhibitor; anti-tissue fibrosis agent such as

                                            -9
    anti-pulmonary fibrosis agent, anti-hepatic fibrosis agent, or
    anti-renal fibrosis agent; antidiabetic drug; drug for treating
    diabetic complications such as macroangiopathy or
    microangiopathy; drug for treating various kidney diseases such
 5  as diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), nephrotic
    syndrome, post-renal kidney injury, or pyelonephritis; drug for
    treating ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, oxygen
    induced retinopathy, or glaucoma; drug for treating polycystic
    ovary syndrome;        anti-radiation damage drug; drug for treating
10  alopecia  (calvities);        drug for treating splenohepatomegaly;    agent
    for promoting bone-marrow regeneration;           anti-obesity drug;  anti
    amyloid drug;      anti-arteriosclerosis agent, or anti-Alzheimer's
    drug.
                Another object of the present invention is to provide a
15  novel compound effective as an active component for a
    pharmaceutical composition that is effective for prevention and
    treatment of the above-described various pathological conditions
    and diseases.
20  Solution to Problem
                 The present inventors have conducted studies to solve
     the above problems, and found that a compound represented by the
     following formula (I) or a salt thereof, or a solvate thereof
     (hereinafter collectively referred to as "compound (I) of the
 25  present invention" or simply referred to as "compound (I)"), as
     well as the compound described in an international publication
     (patent document 1), has high inhibitory activity on plasminogen
     activator inhibitor-1        (PAI-1).   As described above,  it is  known
     that PAI-1 inhibitor has effects as a fibrinolysis promoter as
 30  well as an anti-fibrosis agent for inhibiting tissue fibrosis
     such as pulmonary fibrosis.          In addition to these effects, PAI-1
     inhibitor is know to have effects of preventing or treating
     diseases and pathological conditions such as cancer; diabetes
     mellitus; diabetic complications such as macroangiopathy and
 35  microangiopathy; ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy,

                                                -10
    oxygen-induced retinopathy, and glaucoma; various kidney diseases
    (diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), nephrotic
    syndrome, post-renal kidney injury, and pyelonephritis);
    polycystic ovary syndrome; radiation damage; alopecia
 5  (calvities); splenohepatomegaly; bone-marrow regeneration;
    obesity; amyloidosis;         and arteriosclerosis.            Further,   current
    studies suggest that PAI-1 inhibitor is useful as a therapeutic
    medicine for Alzheimer's disease, which is considered to be
    caused by AB deposition in the brain.
10                  Accordingly, in addition to the fact that the compound
     (I) of the present invention is effective as a fibrinolysis
    promoter, based on its inhibitory action on the PAI-1 activity,
    the compound (I) is considered to be capable of significantly
    ameliorating tissue fibrosis as an anti-fibrosis agent and is
15  also capable of preventing or ameliorating various diseases and

 5               The condensation reaction may be carried out between
    the compounds (1) and (2) in the presence of a known condensing

                   The reaction of the compounds (1) and (2) with the
    reactive derivative is generally carried out in a solvent, and,
    if    necessary,   in   the presence of a base.    An inert   organic solvent
    is commonly used as a solvent; however, water can sometimes be
 5  used as a solvent, or a mixture thereof can also be used.
    Examples of usable organic solvents include halogenated alkyls
     (e.g., methylene chloride and chloroform); aromatic hydrocarbons
     (e.g., benzene, toluene, xylene, and anisole); ethers (e.g.,
     diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl isobutyl ether, methyl
10   cyclopentyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dioxane); esters
     (e.g., methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, and
     butyl acetate); ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and
     methyl isobutyl ketone);        acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide
     (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), N-methylpiperidone, dimethyl
15   sulfoxide;     etc.    Examples of usable bases include inorganic bases
      (e.g., sodium hydrogencarbonate, potassium hydrogencarbonate,
     sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide,
     potassium hydroxide, and lithium hydroxide);          and organic bases
      (e.g., pyridine, triethyl amine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, N
20   methylmorpholine,        and N-methylpiperidine).    The reaction
     temperature varies depending on the condensing agent used or the
     kind of reactive derivative of the compound (2),           but typically
                                                0
      ranges from about -30 0 C to about 120 C,     and preferably from about
      -10  0
             C to about 100 0 C.  The amount of the condensing agent and base
 25   used is typically about 1 to about 5 equivalent weight, and
      preferably about 1 to about 3 equivalent weight, per mol of the
      compound (2).       The amount of the compound (2),     when used in  the
      form of a reactive derivative, is about 1 to about 5 equivalent
      weight, and preferably about 1 to about 2 equivalent weight, per
 30   mol of the compound (1).
                    The thus-prepared ester moiety (I-1) can be made into
       the compound (1-2) of the present invention in the form of a free
       radical carboxylic acid by removing the ester linkage therefrom.
                    The conditions to perform such a removal vary depending
 35    on the kind of R9a,      but preferably used acids include hydrogen

                                           -81
     chloride, hydrogen bromide, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic
     acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, etc., when R9a
     is a t-butyl group.        In this case, the removal reaction is
     typically carried out in an inactive solvent           (e.g., benzene,
 5   toluene, ethyl ether, isopropyl ether, THF, ethyl acetate,
                                                                           0
     dichloromethane,     and chloroform) at about 00C to about 60 C.             The
     amount of acid used varies depending on the kind thereof, but is
     typically about 1 to about 10 equivalent weight per mol of the
     compound (I-1).      Further, when trifluoroacetic acid is used as the
10   acid, it can also be used as a solvent.
                  When R 9a is   alkyl,  aryl, or aralkyl,     an alkali
     hydrolysis reaction can be employed.          In this   case,  suitably
     usable alkalis     include lithium hydroxide,       sodium hydroxide,
     potassium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, etc.; and suitably usable
15    solvents include methanol, ethanol, dioxane, THF, or mixtures
      thereof,  etc.    The amount of alkali     used is   typically about 1 to
      about 3 equivalent weight per mole of the compound (I-1), and the
      reaction temperature ranges from about OC           to about 80 0 C.   In   an
      alkali hydrolysis reaction, a salt is first formed from the
 20   alkali  used.    Thus,  R9a can be isolated as a salt      thereof,    or can
      be isolated as a free radical carboxylic acid by neutralization
      using a suitable acid (e.g., acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and
      sulfuric acid).     Alternatively,     a free radical carboxylic acid is
      first isolated and then converted into an alkali metal salt or
 25    alkaline earth metal salt      by a known method.      Further, when the
       compound (I) of the present invention contains a basic nitrogen
       functional group in     molecules,   R9a can be isolated as an acid
       chloride of the compound (I) by treating with an equivalent or
       excessive weight of an acid.
 30                 When R9a is   aralkyl (e.g.,   benzyl),   the compound      (I-1)
       can be converted to a free radical carboxylic acid (1-2) by being
       subjected to catalytic reduction by a known method using hydrogen
       gas in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium carbon,
       palladium black, etc.

    represented by D-Ta-M (14) are reacted in the presence of a
    catalyst,  as necessary.   The reaction conditions vary depending on

    is, when a compound that is boric acid or (cyclic) boric acid
    ester residue is used, preferable examples of the catalyst
    include palladium catalysts (e.g.,

     (e.g., DMF, 1,4-dioxane, toluene, and THF) in the presence of, if
    necessary, a base (e.g., sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate,
    and potassium phosphate).    The reaction temperature is        about 200 C
20  to about 120 0 C, and preferably about 30 0 C to about 100'C.         The
     amount of D-Ta-M (14) used is about 1 to about 5 equivalent
    weight, and preferably about 1.5 to about 2 equivalent weight,

     tetrakis(triphenylphosphine))palladium (0),
 30  bis(dibenzylideneacetone)palladium (0),     and palladium acetate)
     are preferably used,  in  a manner similar to the above.         The amount
     of the zinc reagent (Ar-Ta-M) used is about 1 to about 3
     equivalent weight, and preferably about 1.5 to about 2 equivalent
     weight, per mole of the compound (13).

    D-Tb (15) and the compound (13) are subjected to a Sonogashira
    reaction in    the presence of a catalyst.      The catalyst used in    the
    Sonogashira reaction is generally a suitable combination of a
    main catalyst (e.g., a palladium complex), a ligand (e.g., a
 5  phosphine compound),     and a promoter (e.g.,     copper halide).    The
    reaction conditions vary depending on the kind of W, D-Tb, etc.;
    however, examples of the palladium complex include
    bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium dichloride,
    bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium dibromide,
10  tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium,        etc.   Examples of the
    copper halide include copper iodide and copper bromide.           Examples
    of the phosphine compound (i.e.,       ligand)   include
    triphenylphosphine, tris(2-methylphenyl)phosphine, tris(3
    methylphenyl)phosphine, tris(4-methylphenyl)phosphine, tris(4
15  methoxyphenyl)phosphine, tri-n-butylphosphine, tri-tert
    butylphosphine, tricyclopentylphosphine, tri-n-hexylphosphine,
     tri-cyclohexyl phosphine,    tri-n-octylphosphine,      etc.  Although the
     amount of the catalyst used in the Sonogashira reaction is not
     particularly specified, specifically, for example, the amount of
20   bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium dichloride added is preferably
     0.01 to 0.5 mol% relative to the amount of the acetylene compound
     (15).   The amount of triphenylphosphine added is 1 to 20
     equivalent weight, per mole of bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium
     dichloride.    Moreover,  the amount of copper iodide added is       1 to
 25  10 equivalent weight, per mole of
     bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium       dichloride.   The amount of the
     compound (15) used in the Sonogashira reaction is generally 1 to
     10 equivalent weight,    per mole of the compound (13).       The solvent
     usable in the Sonogashira reaction is, for example, an amine
 30  solvent,   such as diethylamine,    triethylamine,    or butylamine.   When
     the starting materials are difficult to dissolve in such an amine
      solvent, an aprotic polar solvent, such as N,N'-dimethylformamide
      (DMF), N,N'-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), or N-methylpyrrolidone
      (NMP),  may be added.   The amount of amine solvent used in       the
 35   Sonogashira reaction is not particularly specified; however, the

                                                  -92
    amount of amine solvent is typically 2 to 10 equivalent weight,
    per mole of the starting materials.                    The reaction temperature in
    the Sonogashira reaction depends on the kind of solvent used, but
                                          0
    is     room temperature to 90 C.            The reaction pressure may be normal
 5  pressure, and the reaction time is not particularly limited.

    (3) PAI-1 inhibitor
                The present invention provides an application of the
 5  compound (I)    as a PAI-1 inhibitor.      More specifically, the present
    invention provides a PAI-1 inhibitor comprising the compound (I)
    as an active ingredient.     In   other words,   the PAI-1 inhibitor of
    the invention comprises the compound (I) having PAI-1 inhibitory
    activity as an active ingredient.
10               The PAI-1 inhibitory activity of the compound (I) can
    be evaluated using an in    vitro     assay system.  For example,
    mentioned as such an in vitro assay system is a method for
    examining change in PAI-1 activity to a tissue plasminogen
    activator  (t-PA)   in the presence of the compound (I).      The change
15  in PAI-1 activity can be examined by setting, as an index, a
    reaction product produced by the action of t-PA on a substrate.
    For example, the test example described later shows an in vitro
    assay system for examining change in the PAI-1 activity by
    setting, as an index, a quantity of p-nitroaniline (reaction
20  product) produced by the action of t-PA on a coloring substrate
     (S-2288).      It can be judged that when the amount of reaction
    product is larger, the t-PA activity is higher, and accordingly
     the PAI-1 inhibitory activity is higher.
                 The evaluation of PAI-1 inhibitory activity of the
 25  compound (I) can also be carried out by examining the change in
     formation of a complex of PAI-1 and t-PA (PAI-1/t-PA complex) in
     the presence of the compound (I) using, for example, western
     blotting.   In  the invention,   it   can be judged that when the amount
     of formation of PAI-1/t-PA complex is smaller (PAI-1/t-PA complex
 30  formation inhibition), the PAI-1 inhibitory action is higher.
                 The action can increase plasmin-dependent degradation
     of fibrin and fibrinogen, thereby promoting in vivo fibrinolysis
     and also improving various diseases (e.g., ischemic heart
     diseases such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and
 35  cardiac insufficiency;    deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary

                                      -105
    embolism originated therefrom; and diabetic angiopathy) caused by
    depression of in vivo fibrinolysis (see Non-Patent Document 11).
                It has been proved that one of the causes of tissue
    fibrosis is PAI-l.     It is also known that the development of
  5 pulmonary fibrosis can be inhibited by PAI-1 inhibitors (see Non
    Patent Document 24).     Therefore, the use of the compound (I) makes
    it possible to prevent or improve tissue fibrosis and diseases
    associated with tissue fibrosis      (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis) based
    on inhibitory action on PAI-1 activity.
10              Additionally, it is also reported that PAI-1 inhibitors
    have a stimulatory effect on the degradation of AP, which is
    regarded as a cause of the development of Alzheimer's disease, as
    a result of being accumulated in the brain (see Non-Patent
    Document 27).     Therefore, the compound (I) is expected to be able
15  to promote AP degradation based on the PAI-1 inhibitory activity
    to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease or to improve the
    disease.
                 Furthermore, PAI-1 inhibitors are effective to prevent
    or alleviate various pathologies reportedly associated with PAI-1
20   (e.g., various thromboses, cancers, diabetes and diabetic
    complications, eye diseases such as glaucoma and retinopathy,
    polycystic ovary syndrome, radiation injuries, alopecia
     (calvities), hepatosplenomegaly, obesity, and arteriosclerosis)
     (see Non-Patent Documents 12 to 17).
 25              The PAI-1 inhibitor of the invention comprises the
     compound (I) having PAI-1 inhibitory activity as an active
     ingredient.   In  the PAI-1 inhibitor of the invention,   the
     proportion of the compound (I) may be 100%; conversely, the PAI-1
     inhibitor of the invention may comprise an effective amount of
 30  the compound (I)    for demonstrating PAI-1 inhibitory activity.   The
     proportion of the compound (I) is not limited, and is usually 0.1
     to 99% by weight, and preferably 1 to 80% by weight.
     (4) Pharmaceutical composition
 35              The present invention provides a pharmaceutical

                                        -106
    composition comprising the PAI-1 inhibitor described above as an
    active ingredient.        In other words,  the pharmaceutical composition
    of the invention comprises the compound (I) described above as an
    active ingredient.        The pharmaceutical   composition of the
 5  invention is imparted with PAI-1 inhibitory action by including
    an effective       amount of the compound (I).    As a result, the
    pharmaceutical composition of the invention increases the
    plasmin-dependent degradation of fibrin and fibrinogen, to
    thereby demonstrate the actions of promoting in vivo fibrinolysis
10  or improving depression of in vivo fibrinolysis.
                   Therefore, the pharmaceutical composition of the
    invention can be used as a fibrinolysis promoter.          To be specific,
    the pharmaceutical composition of the invention is useful as a
    prophylactic and therapeutic agent for thrombotic diseases and
15  pathologies whose development is attributed to PAI-1 activity, or
    diseases and pathologies whose development is attributed to
    depression of the fibrinolytic        system.   Mentioned as such diseases
     or pathologies are various diseases or pathologies caused by
     thrombus formation, such as thrombosis in arteries, thrombosis in
20  veins, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) during surgical operations,
     disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome (DIC), diabetic
     complications, such as angiopathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and
     nephropathy, or restenosis after percutaneous transluminal
     coronary angioplasty (PTCA).       Examples of thrombosis in    arteries
 25  include thrombosis in the brain (cerebral thrombosis, cerebral
     embolism, and transient ischemic attack), thrombosis in the heart
     (angina pectoris and myocardial infarction), thrombosis in the
     lower extremities (lower extremity acute arterial thrombosis),
     and thrombosis in the upper intestinal tract (upper intestinal
 30  tract  arterial     thrombosis).  Examples of thrombosis in    veins
     include thrombosis in the extremities (deep-vein thrombosis) and
     thrombosis occurring when a blood clot travels to the lung
      (pulmonary embolism).
                     The pharmaceutical composition of the invention has an
 35   effective amount of the compound (I),        and is thus imparted with a

                                     -107
    PAI-1 inhibitory action.    Therefore,  the pharmaceutical
    composition of the invention prevents or alleviates tissue or
    organ fibrosis.   Accordingly, the pharmaceutical composition of
    the invention is useful as an agent for preventing or treating
  5 diseases and/or pathologies related to tissue or organ fibrosis
    whose development is   influenced by PAI-1 activity.      Examples of
    such diseases or pathologies include tissue fibrosis associated
    with pulmonary fibrosis and myocardial infarction, and organ
    fibrosis associated with nephropathy, etc.
10
                 Moreover, since the pharmaceutical composition of the
    invention has an effective amount of the compound (I),       and thus
    is imparted with a PAI-1 inhibitory action, the pharmaceutical
    composition of the invention is useful as an anti-Alzheimer's
15  drug,  as described above.   Therefore,  the pharmaceutical
    composition of the invention is useful as an agent for preventing
    or treating Alzheimer's disease.
                Furthermore, since the pharmaceutical composition of
    the invention has an effective amount of the compound (I),        and
20  thus is imparted with a PAI-1 inhibitory action, the
    pharmaceutical composition of the invention is useful as an agent
    for preventing or treating various pathologies mentioned above
     (e.g., various thromboses, cancers, diabetes and diabetic
    complications, eye diseases such as glaucoma and retinopathy,
25  polycystic ovary syndrome, radiation injuries, alopecia
     (calvities), hepatosplenomegaly, bone-marrow regeneration,
    obesity,  amyloidosis,   and arteriosclerosis).     The pharmaceutical
    composition of the invention generally comprises a
    pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or additive in addition to
 30 the compound (I) in an amount effective for exhibiting PAI-1
     inhibitory action.  The proportion of the compound (I)      in the
    pharmaceutical composition of the invention is suitably
     determined according to the kind of target diseases and/or
    pathologies or manner of administrating the pharmaceutical
 35  composition, and is usually in the range of from 0.001 to 50% by

                                          -108
    weight, and particularly from 0.01 to 10% by weight, based on the
    total weight of the pharmaceutical composition (100% by weight).
                    The pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be
    administered orally or parenterally, such as intravenously,
  5 intramuscularly, subcutaneously, transmucosally, transdermally,
    intrarectally,       etc.   Among these,   preferable are oral
    administration and intravenous administration, and more
    preferable is       oral administration.     The pharmaceutical  composition
    of the invention can be provided in various forms of preparations
10   (dosage forms) depending on the above-mentioned administration
    manners.       Various preparations (dosage forms) are described below;

    (cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)phenol                   and       541     mg     (3.82     mmol)          of     ethyl
    bromoacetate.         The mixture was heated while stirring                           at 80 0 C for 3
    hours,      and     then      cooled      to  room       temperature.           Water         and     ethyl
    acetate       were     added       thereto,     and      extraction        was     performed.            The

     to the residue at 00 C. The mixture was stirred                                at room temperature
     for 5 hours.          After the completion of the reaction,                              ethyl acetate
     and water were added                  to separate          the mixture.          The organic           layer
 25 was washed with water two times and dried over magnesium sulfate,
     followed     by      filtration.             After      the   filtrate        was     condensed,         the

               Each of compounds (1) to (7) and (9) to (14) prepared in
    Examples 1 to 14,           and the known compounds                  (1)    and (2)   (see Table
 5  1)  was   evaluated          for     inhibitory        activity          against    human      PAI-1
    (manufactured        by     Molecular        Innovations,            Inc.     (USA);     the     same
    applies hereinafter).
                Specifically,            human-derived          PAI-1 was         added    to   a    0.1%
    Tween   80-containing           100 mM Tris-HCl             (pH     8)     solution    containing
10  each of the above compounds in                   a given concentration               (0.29     mM or
    0.12 mM),    and the mixture was incubated                         at 37 0 C for 15 minutes.
    Subsequently,        human-derived          tissue       plasminogen          activator       (t-PA)
    (manufactured         by     American       Diagnostica,            Inc.      (USA);     the     same
    applies hereinafter)             adjusted      to 0.35        pmol/pL was added thereto,
15  and   the  mixture        was     further      incubated         at     37'C   for   15   minutes.
    Then,   1.25    mM      of    S-2288      synthetic         substrate         (manufactured        by
    Chromogenix,       (Italy);        the same applies hereinafter),                    which was a
    chromogenic substrate, was added.                     The final mixture contained 100
    mM Tris-HCl       (pH     8),    30 mM NaCl,          1% DMSO,         0.1% Tween       80,    67   nM
20  PAI-1,    9.8   nMt-PA,          1    mM   S-2288      synthetic           substrate,      and    the
    compound (50 pM or 20 pM).
                Free radical p-nitroaniline removed from the chromogenic
     substrate     (S-2288)           by     t-PA       action        was       measured      using      a
     spectrophotometer            at     an    absorbance           of     405     nm   at    5-minute
 25  intervals for 30 minutes.                A systems that did not contain each of
     compounds (1) to (7) and (9) to (14) was similarly evaluated, and
     the PAI-1    activity         of    the system after             30 minutes        was   taken     as
     100% to evaluate           the     PAI-1    activity        of    a     system in    which      test
     compound was added. The results are shown in Table 1.

     a rat model of ferric chloride-induced thrombosis.
                    Male     9-week-old       SD     rats       (Japan        SLC)      were       used,     and

10   having      n=10).      Two   hours    before         the     operation          for     performing          a
     test,       in     the   test     compound           group,          a    0.5%       aqueous       sodium
     carboxymethylcellulose              (CMC)       solution          obtained        by     suspending          a
     test compound in a mortar was added so that the test compound was
     orally administered in              an amount of 0.3 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg.                             In    the
15   vehicle group, a 0.5% CMC aqueous solution that contained no test
     compound          was    orally       administered.                Two       hours         after       oral
      administration, the rats in each group were anesthetized using 50
     mg/kg i.p.,         and the following operations were performed on a heat

      carotid      artery     was    exposed      in     such      a    manner       that     the     cervical
      skeletal         muscle    was      not     injured.            The      adhesion          tissue       was
      carefully        peeled    off.     Silk     thread        was      placed       over     the    carotid
      artery,      and filter       paper was put on the backside                          of    the carotid

  5  0.5 mL of physiological saline filled into a syringe. Observation
     was then continued until                      a blood clot was               formed and the carotid
     artery        was    occluded           (maximum        30     minutes).          The     blood    flow    was

      (2) Evaluation of fibrinolytic action
                 The      fibrinolytic       action     of      Compounds        a   and      b    were
 5  evaluated       in    accordance     with    the   document         (Matsuo,       0.    et    al.,
    Haemostasis, 16, 43-50 (1986)).
                  Specifically,         an   aqueous      solution         (containing          25    mM
    barbital-sodium,           50   mM   NaCl,     and    25      mM    CaCl2)      containing           a
    concentration          of   1.5   mg/mL   of    fibrinogen         (produced        by    Organon
10  Teknica) was added, on a 9 cm-plate, to thrombin dissolved in 0.2
    mL     of  physiological          saline    (10NIH      U/mL:      produced         by    Mochida
    Pharmaceutical          Co.,   Ltd.),    and the mixture was              allowed       to stand
    at room temperature for 2 hours.                 Using this        mixture,      fibrinolysis
    assay was conducted.
15                Namely,      a  mixture of      PAI-1,       t-PA,     and a     test     compound
    was added dropwise to the plate and incubated at room temperature
     for    18 hours.       Then,    fibrinolysis       due     to plasminogen           activation
    was measured from the lysis area on the plate.
                  The results        demonstrate      that      compounds      a   and b inhibit
20   the suppression of fibrinolysis caused by PAI-1.
       (3)    Evaluation         of    effects      on    bleomycin-induced                pulmonary
     fibrosis
                   In   order to evaluate the in            vivo antifibrotic              action of
 25  compound       b    having     PAI-1     inhibitory          activity,        the     following
     experiments        were carried       out using an          animal     (mouse)      model with
     pulmonary fibrosis artificially induced by bleomycin.
                  A     C57BL/6    mouse    (male,     body      weight:      19    to    21    g)   was
      intraperitoneally           anesthetized         with        pentobarbital,            and       an
 30   incision was        made on the cervical          organ.        Ten mice were used as
      controls.        Bleomycin     (produced     by Nippon Kayaku             Co.,     Ltd.)      (1.5
      U/kg)      lysed        in    physiological         saline          was      endotracheally
      administered        to each of the control mice                (n=10)     twice a        day for
      14   days.       On   the   other    hand,   the    test      mice     were    subjected          to
 35   forcible oral administration of compound b (200 mg/kg), suspended

                                                -235
    in   a  0. 5% carboxymethyl          cellulose aqueous           solution,       twice     a  day
    for      14      days,     in      addition         to     the     above        endotracheal
    administration.          Then,    the lung tissues           taken from these control
    mice     and     test    mice    were     analyzed,        and    further        assayed      for
 5  hydroxyproline          level.       The   hydroxyproline           level      in     the    lung
    tissues      was     measured      as    the    hydrolysate        level       of     the    lung
    tissues,       according      to    the   method       of   Kivirikko        et   al.     (Anal.
    Biochem. 19,        249-255     (1967)).       The level       (severity)       of pulmonary
    fibrosis was        scored from 0 to 8,             based on the method of Ashcort
10  et    al.    (J.    Clin.     Pathol.     41,    467-470       (1988)).         Further,      the
     control     mice     and   the   test    mice     were     assayed     for     plasma      PAI-1
     activity (ng/mL).
                   Fig. 3 shows the results of the lung tissue analysis (a:
     fibrosis      scores,     b:   tissue     stained       images),      and    the     following

      significantly        reduced       the   hydroxyproline          level        in    the    lung
      tissues,        which     had      been      dramatically          increased          by     the
      administration        of   bleomycin.         Further,       the   results       demonstrate
      that   the administration           of bleomycin        remarkably       increased plasma
 25   PAI-1   activity,      and that such increases in               plasma PAI-1 activity
      were significantly reduced by the administration of compound b.

     the administered bleomycin                            (fibrosis score:             4.7           0.17,     Control
     group:         0.5         0.17,     P<0.001)          was significantly ameliorated by the
     administration                 of     compound           b     (fibrosis         score:           2.9         0.42,
     P<0.01).           These results agree with the results of the above PAI-1
 5   activity.
                      The results              suggest that compound b and other compounds

     process          of      pulmonary            fibrosis,           in     addition          to     an     effect      of
     promoting           fibrinolytic              system.          It    has    already been reported                    by
10   Eitzman          et     al.     that        a   strong        relationship            is     observed       between
     PAI-1        expression            and       the    accumulation            of    collagen           in   the     lung
     tissues          of      mice      in     which        the     PAI-1       gene      is      overexpressed            or

     results,            showing           that        pulmonary            fibrosis          is      alleviated           by
15   compound           b     having       a     strong        PAI-1       inhibitory           activity,        suggest
      that       PAI-1       is    not     a    simply        an    indicator       of       pulmonary fibrosis,
      but the primary factor thereof.                                 Fibril      formation occurs in                  many
      tissues          and       organs        such      as     the      heart,      blood          vessels,       liver,
      kidneys,          etc.,        in      addition          to     lungs.        For        this      reason,       this
20    finding is critical.
                        Additionally,               PAI-1       is     also     known         to     be     involved       in
      radiation            injuries,           and      in     the      development            and     metastasis          of
      cancer.          More specifically, some studies on humans or animals have
      reported          increased expression of PAI-1 in                              radiation            injuries and
 25   growth          and       metastasis           of      cancer,         in   addition            to     thrombosis,
      fibrosis, and atherosclerosis (Thromb. Haemost. 2005 Apr;                                                   93 (4),

                        Another         finding related                 to PAI-1       is      that in        myocardial

       involved in              intimal hyperplasia,                   and that PAI-1 plays a key role

    is     suggested            to     be     associated            with     the   inhibition            of     matrix
    degradation            in     cirrhotic          liver.          This    implies       that PAI-1           has    an
 5  important role in                   the development               of liver     fibrosis in             cirrhotic

    is    known that            PAI-1 is           related to expansion of the mesangium in

     Regarding         radiation            injuries,           it    is    reported       that     in     radiation
     therapy for abdominal and pelvic cancers, radiation-induced PAI-1
     plays    a    critical           role      in    intestinal           damage    (Am.     J.     Pathol.         2008

15   PAI-1,      PAI-1          is     considered            to     be     deeply    associated             with      the
     development           of many diseases                  in     various     organs,       as explained in
