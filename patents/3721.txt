                    METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR THERAPEUTIC AGENTS
                                       Cross Reference to Related Applications
[0001]                     The present application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Serial
No. 61/591,837, filed on January 27, 2012, the contents of which are herein incorporated by
reference in their entirety.
                                                       Background
[0002]                     Most vaccines, including attenuated virus vaccines, lose potency over time and
the rate of potency loss is temperature-dependent. Therefore, cold-chain systems have been
established to ensure that the potency of vaccines is maintained by storing them under
refrigerated conditions (in most cases between 2 and 8'C) until the point of use. Establishing a
cold chain for vaccine storage and distribution is a major undertaking and maintenance is
difficult. It is also apparent that, despite best efforts, cold chains do not always function as
intended for many reasons, such as improperly maintained or outdated refrigeration equipment,
power outages resulting in equipment failure, poor compliance with cold-chain procedures and
inadequate monitoring. The result is that vaccines in the cold chain are often subjected to
temperature excursions (i.e., temperatures outside of the target range).
[00031                     Other therapeutic agents, e.g., certain therapeutic proteins also lose potency when
exposed to high temperatures. There therefore remains a need in the art for improved
compositions and methods that allow these therapeutic agents to be stable and retain potency
when exposed to high temperatures.
                                                         Summary
[0004]                     The present disclosure provides inter alia compositions that comprise therapeutic
agents (e.g., live attenuated viral antigens, therapeutic proteins, etc.) and a lipid component. The
lipid component may comprise or consist of different types of lipid or lipids as described herein.
In some embodiments the therapeutic agents are thermolabile.
                                                              1
9770469_1 (GHMaters) P97653.AU.1

[00051                     In one aspect, the lipid component consists of one or more non-ionic surfactants.
In some embodiments, the lipid component in these compositions consists of a single non-ionic
surfactant (e.g., MPG).
[00061                     In another aspect, the lipid component consists of one or more non-ionic
surfactants and one or more steroids. In some embodiments, the lipid component in these
compositions consists of a single non-ionic surfactant (e.g., MPG) and a single steroid (e.g.,
cholesterol).
[0007]                     In another aspect, the lipid component comprises one or more lipids that combine
to form vesicles (i.e., "vesicular compositions"). In some embodiments, the lipids are combined
to form vesicles in the absence of therapeutic agent and then admixed with the therapeutic agent
(i.e., the compositions include "pre-formed vesicles"). In some of these embodiments, the lipids
comprise a non-ionic surfactant, a steroid and an ionic amphiphile. Vesicular compositions
prepared in accordance with these embodiments may include any ionic amphiphile including any
of the exemplary ionic amphiphiles that are described herein. In some embodiments, the lipids
are combined to form vesicles in the presence of therapeutic agent. Vesicular compositions
prepared in accordance with these embodiments may include any of the exemplary
phosphoglycerides that are described herein as an ionic amphiphile. In some embodiments, the
lipid component in these vesicular compositions consists of a single non-ionic surfactant (e.g.,
MPG), a single steroid (e.g., cholesterol) and a single ionic amphiphile (e.g., DCP or DPPG). In
some embodiments, the lipid component in these vesicular compositions consists of a single non
ionic surfactant (e.g., MPG), a single steroid (e.g., cholesterol) and a single ionic amphiphile
(e.g., DCP) and the vesicles are pre-formed. In some embodiments, the lipid component in these
vesicular compositions consists of a non-ionic surfactant (e.g., MPG), a steroid (e.g., cholesterol)
and a phosphoglyceride as the ionic amphiphile (e.g., DPPG) and the vesicles are pre-formed or
formed in the presence of therapeutic agent.
[00081                     The present disclosure also provides methods for preparing compositions,
including the aforementioned compositions (e.g., melt methods and spray injection methods
among others).

                                                       Definitions
[00131                     Throughout the present disclosure, several terms are employed that are defined in
the following paragraphs.
[0014]                     As used herein, the term "antigen" or "viral antigen" refers to a substance
containing one or more epitopes that can be recognized by an antibody. In some embodiments,
an antigen can be a virus. The term "antigen" encompasses inter alia attenuated and inactivated
viruses. In some embodiments, an antigen may be an "immunogen."
[0015]                     As used herein, the term "immune response" refers to a response elicited in an
animal. An immune response may refer to cellular immunity, humoral immunity or may involve
both. An immune response may also be limited to a part of the immune system. For example, in
some embodiments, an immunogenic composition may induce an increased IFNy response. In
some embodiments, an immunogenic composition may induce a mucosal IgA response (e.g., as
                                                            3
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

measured in nasal and/or rectal washes). In some embodiments, an immunogenic composition
may induce a systemic IgG response (e.g., as measured in serum).
[00161                     As used herein, the term "immunogenic" means capable of producing an immune
response in a host animal against a non-host entity (e.g., a viral antigen). In some embodiments,
this immune response forms the basis of the protective immunity elicited by a vaccine against a
specific infectious organism (e.g., a virus).
[0017]                     As used herein, the terms "therapeutically effective amount" refer to the amount
sufficient to show a meaningful benefit in a subject being treated. The therapeutically effective
amount of a composition may vary depending on such factors as the desired biological endpoint,
the nature of the composition, the route of administration, the health, size and/or age of the
subject being treated, etc.
[00181                     As used herein, the term "treat" (or "treating", "treated", "treatment", etc.) refers
to the administration of a composition to a subject who has a disease, a symptom of a disease or
a predisposition toward a disease, with the purpose to alleviate, relieve, alter, ameliorate,
improve or affect the disease, a symptom or symptoms of the disease, or the predisposition
toward the disease. In some embodiments, the term "treating" refers to the vaccination of a
subject.
[0018a]                    It is to be understood that, if any prior art publication is referred to herein, such
reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part of the common
general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country.
[0018b]                    In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the invention,
except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication,
the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive
sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or
addition of further features in various embodiments of the invention.

                                      Detailed Description of Some embodiments
I. Compositions
[0019]                     The present disclosure provides inter alia compositions that comprise therapeutic
agents and a lipid component. As used herein the term "lipid component" encompasses all lipids
that are present in the composition. The lipid component may comprise or consist of different
types of lipid or lipids as described herein.
Lipid Component
[0020]                     In one aspect, the lipid component consists of one or more non-ionic surfactants.
In some embodiments, the lipid component consists of a single non-ionic surfactant. Without
limitation, examples of suitable non-ionic surfactants include ester-linked surfactants based on
glycerol. Such glycerol esters may comprise one of two higher aliphatic acyl groups, e.g.,
containing at least ten carbon atoms in each acyl moiety. Non-ionic surfactants based on such
glycerol esters may comprise more than one glycerol unit, e.g., up to 5 glycerol units. Glycerol
monoesters may be used, e.g., those containing a C12-C 2oalkanoyl or alkenoyl moiety, for
example caproyl, lauroyl, myristoyl, palmitoyl, oleyl or stearoyl. An exemplary non-ionic
surfactant is 1-monopalmitoyl glycerol (MPG). Ether-linked surfactants may also be used as
non-ionic surfactants. For example, ether-linked surfactants based on glycerol or a glycol having
a lower aliphatic glycol of up to 4 carbon atoms, such as ethylene glycol, are suitable. Non-ionic
surfactants based on such glycols may comprise more than one glycol unit, e.g., up to 5 glycol
units (e.g., diglycolcetyl ether and/or polyoxyethylene-3-lauryl ether). Glycol or glycerol
monoethers may be used, including those containing a C 12-C 2oalkanyl or alkenyl moiety, for
example capryl, lauryl, myristyl, cetyl, oleyl or stearyl. Ethylene oxide condensation products
that can be used include those disclosed in PCT Publication No. W088/06882 (e.g.,
polyoxyethylene higher aliphatic ether and amine surfactants). Exemplary ether-linked
surfactants include 1-monocetyl glycerol ether and diglycolcetyl ether.
[0021]                     In another aspect, the lipid component consists of one or more non-ionic
surfactants and one or more steroids (e.g., a sterol such as cholesterol). In some embodiments,
                                                            5
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

the lipid component consists of a single non-ionic surfactant (e.g., MPG) and a single steroid
(e.g., cholesterol). In some embodiments, the non-ionic surfactant(s) and steroid(s) are present in
the composition in a molar ratio in the range of about 6:4 to about 4:4, e.g., about 5:4.
[0022]                     In another aspect, the lipid component comprises one or more lipids that combine
to form vesicles (i.e., "vesicular compositions").
[00231                     In some embodiments, the lipids are combined to form vesicles in the absence of
therapeutic agent and then admixed with the therapeutic agent (i.e., the compositions include
"pre-formed vesicles"). In some of these embodiments, the lipids comprise a non-ionic
surfactant, a steroid (e.g., a sterol such as cholesterol) and an ionic amphiphile. Vesicular
compositions prepared in accordance with these embodiments may include any ionic amphiphile
including any of the exemplary ionic amphiphiles that are described below.
[0024]                     In some embodiments, the lipids are combined to form vesicles in the presence of
therapeutic agent. Vesicular compositions prepared in accordance with these embodiments may
include any of the exemplary phosphoglycerides that are described below as an ionic amphiphile.
[0025]                     Exemplary ionic amphiphiles may include, but are not limited to, acidic materials
such as higher alkanoic and alkenoic acids (e.g., palmitic acid, oleic acid) or other compounds
containing acidic groups including phosphates such as dialkyl phosphates (e.g., dicetylphospate
or DCP, or phosphatidic acid or phosphatidyl serine) and sulphate monoesters such as higher
alkyl sulphates (e.g., cetylsulphate), may all be used for this purpose.
[00261                     As noted, above, in some embodiments, a phosphoglyceride (also known as a
glycerophospholipid) can be used as an ionic amphiphile. Phosphoglycerides can be
plasmalogens, phosphatidates (such as phosphatidylethanoamines, phosphatidylcholines),
phosphatidylchonlines, or the like. Exemplary phosphoglycerides include, but are not limited to
diphosphatidyl glycerol (DPPG); 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DPPS); 1,2
Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC); 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3
phosphoethanolamine (DSPE); phosphatidylcholine dipalmitoyl (DPPC) and derivatives thereof.
[0027]                     In some embodiments, the lipid component in these vesicular compositions
consists of a single non-ionic surfactant (e.g., MPG), a single steroid (e.g., cholesterol) and a
                                                            6
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

single ionic amphiphile (e.g., DCP or DPPG). In some embodiments, the lipid component in
these vesicular compositions consists of a single non-ionic surfactant (e.g., MPG), a single
steroid (e.g., cholesterol) and a single ionic amphiphile (e.g., DCP) and the vesicles are pre
formed. In some embodiments, the lipid component in these vesicular compositions consists of a
non-ionic surfactant (e.g., MPG), a steroid (e.g., cholesterol) and a phosphoglyceride as the ionic
amphiphile (e.g., DPPG) and the vesicles are pre-formed or formed in the presence of therapeutic
agent.
[00281                     In some embodiments, the non-ionic surfactant(s) and steroid are present in these
vesicular compositions in a molar ratio in the range of about 6:4 to about 4:4:, e.g., about 5:4. In
some embodiments, the non-ionic surfactant(s) and ionic amphiphile are present in these
vesicular compositions in a molar ratio in the range of about 6:1 to about 4:1:, e.g., about 5:1. In
some embodiments, the steroid and ionic amphiphile are present in these vesicular compositions
in a molar ratio in the range of about 5:1 to about 3:1:, e.g., about 4:1.
[0029]                     In certain embodiments, a lipid concentration of at least about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90 or 95
mg/ml is achieved. In certain embodiments, the lipid concentration is in a range of about 5
mg/ml to about 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or 25 mg/ml. In certain embodiments,
the lipid concentration is in a range of about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 mg/ml to about
30 mg/ml. In certain embodiments, the lipid concentration is in a range of about 5 mg/ml to
about 50 mg/ml, about 5 mg/ml to about 25 mg/ml, about 10 mg/ml to about 50 mg/ml, about 10
mg/ml to about 30 mg/ml, or about 10 mg/ml to about 50 mg/ml.
[00301                     In some embodiments, the compositions described herein do not comprise a
transport enhancing molecule which facilitates the transport of lipid-like molecules across
mucosal membranes. In some embodiments, the compositions do not comprise a "bile acid"
such as cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, their conjugation products with glycine or taurine
such as glycocholic and taurocholic acid, derivatives including deoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic
acid, and salts of each of these acids. In some embodiments, the compositions do not comprise
acyloxylated amino acids, such as acylcarnitines and salts thereof, and palmitoylcarnitines.

Therapeutic Agents
[0031]                     The present disclosure encompasses the uses of different types of therapeutic
agents. In some embodiments, these agents are thermolabile. As used herein, the terms
"thermolabile agent" refer to agents that loses potency when exposed to certain elevated
temperatures. In some embodiments, exposure of a thermolabile agent to elevated temperatures
destroys over 20% of the potency of the antigen (e.g., over 30%, over 40%, over 50% or more)
as measured in a potency assay (e.g., based on an ICso or EC 50 value) as compared to the un
manipulated agent. In some embodiments, a thermolabile antigen loses potency at temperatures
above 30'C (e.g., above 35'C, above 40'C, above 45'C, or above 50'C). In some embodiments,
storage of a thermolabile agent at one of these elevated temperatures for more than 3 minutes
(e.g., 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes or more) destroys over 20% of the potency (e.g., over
30%, over 40%, over 50% or more) as measured in a potency assay (e.g., based on an ICso or
EC 50 value) as compared to the un-manipulated agent. It is however to be understood that the
methods and compositions of the present disclosure are not limited to thermolabile agents and
that, in some embodiments, the methods or compositions may also involve more stable agents
including traditional small molecule therapeutics.
 Viral Antigens - Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Viral Antigens
[0032]                     Measles, mumps and rubella are three common childhood diseases that are caused
by viral infection (by measles virus (a paramyxovirus), mumps virus (a paramyxovirus), and
rubella virus (a togavirus), respectively). Measles, mumps and rubella infections may cause
serious medical complications which may lead to death. Measles is an infection of the
respiratory system and causes symptoms including fever, cough, runny nose, and general rash,
and commonly leads to complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis. Mumps is an
infection that causes symptoms including inflammation, fever, headache and orchitis, and can
lead to complications such as aseptic meningitis and deafness. Rubella, commonly known as
German measles, generally causes mild symptoms, although infection of a mother during
pregnancy can be quite serious.
                                                           8
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

[00331                     Vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella are produced from live attenuated
viruses which have been propagated in cell substrates.            Each component of MMR vaccine is
initially prepared in the monovalent form, each of which is then mixed together to produce a
trivalent form in which the component virus population is present in a well defined quantity
sufficient to induce an effective immune response in a vaccine recipient. The marketed MMR
vaccines are presented as a lyophilized vial, which has to be kept at 2-8 'C for no more than 3
years as per the licensure indications. However several factors including stabilizer composition,
storage conditions and residual moisture can affect the thermal stability of the lyophilized
vaccine. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends tissue culture infective doses
(TCIDso) assay using Vero cells for evaluating potency of live measles virus in the vaccine.
However, the potency measurements may vary depending on the method of determination, the
laboratory, and the conditions at the time of the test.
[0034]                     WHO has set up minimum requirements for vaccine stability in freeze dried form
as well as when reconstituted as a liquid solution prior to administration. In the freeze dried
state, current measles vaccines must retain a minimum potency of at least 3.0 logio virus particles
per human dose after exposure to a temperature of 37'C for at least one week and the virus titre
dose not decrease by more than 1.0 logio during incubation. However, reconstituted measles
vaccines quickly lose potency at exposure to room temperatures. At 22'C to 25'C the vaccine
loses approximately 50% of potency in one hour. At temperatures over 37'C the vaccine is
inactivated within one hour (The Immunological Basis for Immunization Series, Module 7:
Measles (WHO/EPI/GEN/93.17).
[0035]                     Several attenuated measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines are currently
licensed and have been successful in reducing the incidence of viral infection, and may be used
in accordance with the present disclosure.
[00361                     In some embodiments, the compositions and methods of the present disclosure
may be used with one or more antigens included in a vaccine that is licensed or under
development. Table 1 is a non-limiting list of vaccines that are licensed or under development
for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella infections.

[0037]                     In the following sections we discuss these and other exemplary viral antigens that
could be used in compositions or methods of the present disclosure.
[00381                     In the United States, a measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was first
licensed in 1971, with a second dose of the vaccine introduced in 1989. In general, in countries
where childhood MMR vaccination is routine, the incidence of measles, mumps and rubella has
dramatically decreased (e.g., by more than 99% in 1995 as compared to the number of cases in
 1941).
[00391                     Several attenuated measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines are currently
licensed. For example, M-M-R-II" is developed and manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. M-M
R-II" contains a sterile lyophilized preparation of (1) Attenuvax* (Measles Virus Vaccine Live)
an attenuated line of measles virus, (2) Mumpsvax" (Mumps Virus Vaccine Live) a strain of
mumps virus propagated in chick embryo cell culture, and (3) Meruvax II" (Rubella Virus
Vaccine Live) an attenuated strain of rubella virus. Each 0.5 mL dose contains not less than
 1,000 TCID5 0 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of measles virus, not less than 5,000 TCID5 0
                                                            10
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

of mumps virus, and not less than 1,000 TCID5 0 of rubella virus. Upon reconstitution, M-M-R
II* (as with other licensed MMR vaccines) is typically administered subcutaneously. Although
one dose of M-M-R-II* in children over 12 months of age generally induces the production of
neutralizing antibodies, some patients fail to seroconvert after the first dose. Accordingly, a
second booster is recommended, especially prior to elementary school entry, in order to
seroconvert those who did not respond to the first dose. In order to ensure that there is no loss of
potency of the M-M-R-II" vaccine, it must be maintained at a temperature of 10 C or colder
during shipment, maintained at a temperature of 2'C to 8'C during storage in a lyophilized state,
and used within 8 hours after reconstitution.
[0040]                     Another example of an MMR vaccine, PROQUAD which also contains a
Varicella component has been licensed and sold in the Unites States by Merck, although
production is currently suspended. PROQUAD* is administered once in children over 12
months of age, with an optional booster administered at least three months later.
[0041]                     In one aspect, the present disclosure provides immunogenic compositions that
include an attenuated or inactivated virus. It is to be understood that immunogenic compositions
provided by the present disclosure may include one or more components of an MMR vaccine
(e.g., measles, mumps, or rubella virus, or a combination thereof). In some embodiments,
immunogenic compositions include a varicella virus component (e.g., alone, such as with
VARIVAX*, or in combination with other virus components, such as with PROQUAD*).
[0042]                     As mentioned above, all known licensed MMR vaccines include attenuated
viruses. It is to be understood that any one of these licensed vaccines may be used as described
herein to produce an immunogenic composition. For example, commercial M-M-R-II* may be
used to produce an immunogenic composition. In some embodiments, licensed vaccines are first
purified (e.g., to remove alum adjuvant or other reagents in the vaccine). In some embodiments,
licensed vaccines are not purified prior to formulation as described herein.
[00431                     As is well known in the art, the advantage of an attenuated virus lies in the
potential for higher immunogenicity which results from its ability to replicate in vivo without
causing a full infection. One method which has been used in the art to prepare attenuated viruses
is viral adaptation which involves serially passing a viral strain through multiple cell cultures.
                                                             11
9770469_1 (GHMaters) P97653.AU.1

Over time the strain mutates and attenuated strains can then be identified. For example, in
preparing M-M-R-II*, an attenuated strain of measles virus is propagated in chick embryo cell
culture, a B level strain of mumps is propagated in chick embryo cell culture, and an attenuated
strain of rubella is propagated in human diploid lung fibroblasts. In some embodiments the virus
may be passed through different cell cultures.
[0044]                     It will be appreciated that any measles, mumps, and/or rubella virus strain may be
used, e.g., without limitation any of the following strains which have been described in the art:
                     " Measles virus Enders' attenuated Edmonston strain (AttA)
                     " Measles virus attenuated AIK-C strain
                     " Mumps virus Jeryl Lynn (B-level) strain
                     " Mumps virus Leningrad Zagreb strain
                     " Mumps virus Urabe Am 9 strain
                     " Rubella virus Wistar RA 27/3 strain
                     " Rubella virus Giguere; 1964 United States
                     " Rubella virus HPV-77; 1961 United States
                     " Rubella virus Judith; 1963 Liverpool U.K.
                     " Rubella virus KO-1; 1967 Kochi, Japan
[0045]                     While all currently licensed MMR vaccines include attenuated viruses, alternative
vaccines which include inactivated viruses may be used in accordance with the present
disclosure. In some embodiments, an immunogenic composition may comprise such an
inactivated virus. It will be appreciated that any method may be used to prepare an inactivated
virus. In general, these methods will involve propagating a virus in a host cell, lysing the host
cell to release the virus, isolating and then inactivating the virus. The virus is typically harvested
from cell cultures and screened for infectious dosage as well as for the absence of adventitious
agents. Chemical treatment of the virus (e.g., formalin, formaldehyde, among others) is
commonly used to inactivate the virus. However, it is to be understood that other techniques
could be used, e.g., treatment with chlorine, exposure to high temperatures, etc.

[0047]                     Canine distemper is a disease caused by viral infection by canine distemper virus,
which is a paramyxovirus that is closely related to measles virus. Canine distemper virus may
cause serious medical conditions affecting a variety of mammalian species including dogs,
weasels, skunks, hyenas, raccoons, and non-domestic felines. Canine distemper infection may
causes symptoms including fever, anorexia, runny nose, and eye discharge, and commonly leads
to complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis. An attenuated canine distemper vaccine
has been licensed, including a multivalent DA2PPC vaccine, which protects against canine
distemper (D), adenovirus type 2 (A2), parainfluenza (P), canine parvovirus (P) and canine
coronavirus (C). It is to be understood that immunogenic compositions provided by the present
disclosure may include one or more components of DA2PPC (e.g., a canine distemper virus
antigen).
[00481                     Rotavirus infection leads to rotavirus gastroenteritis, which can be especially
severe in infants and young children. Licensed live attenuated vaccines for treatment of
rotavirus infection include RotaTeq* and Rotarix*. RotaTeq* is indicated for the prevention of
rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by the G1, G2, G3, and G4 serotypes of the virus. RotaTeq* is
administered orally in a three-dose series to infants between the ages of 6 to 32 weeks. Each 2
                                                              13
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

ml dose of RotaTeq* contains a live reassortant virus, containing G1, G2, G3, G4, and PlA and
contains a minimum of 2.0-2.8 x 106 infectious units (IU). Rotarix* is indicated for the
prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by G1, G3, G4, and G9 serotypes of the virus.
Rotarix* is administered orally in a two-dose series to infants between the ages of 6 weeks and
24 weeks of age. Each 1 ml dose of Rotarix® contains a minimum of 106 CCID50 of live,
attenuated human GlP rotavirus.
[0049]                     Shingles is a viral infection of the nerve roots, which typically causes pain and
rash on one side of the body. Shingles is most common in older adults and people with weak
immune systems. A licensed virus for treatment of shingles caused by herpes zoster virus
infection is Zostavax*, which is a lyophilized preparation of the Oka/Merck strain of live,
attenuated varicella-zoster virus. Zostavax* is indicated for subcutaneous administration and is
indicated for individuals 60 years of age and older. Each 0.65 ml dose of Zostavax* contains at
least 19,400 pfu of live, attenuated virus.
[0050]                     Another example of a licensed live attenuated vaccine is DRYVAX          , which is a
live-virus preparation of vaccinia virus for treatment of smallpox virus infection. DRYVAX* is
prepared from calf lymph which is purified, concentrated, and dried by lyophilization. The
reconstituted vaccine has been shown to contain not more than 200 viable bacterial organisms
per ml. DRYVAX* is intended for multiple-puncture use, i.e., administration of the vaccine into
the superficial layers of the skin using a bifurcated needle. Typically, vaccination with
DRYVAX* results in viral multiplication, immunity, and cellular hypersensitivity. With the
primary vaccination, a papule appears at the site of vaccination on about the 2nd to 5th day. This
becomes a vesicle on the 5th or 6th day, which becomes pustular, umbilicated, and surrounded
by erythema and induration. The maximal area of erythema is attained between the 8th and 12th
day following vaccination (usually the 10th). The erythema and swelling then subside, and a
crust forms which comes off about the 14th to 21st day. At the height of the primary reaction
known as the Jennerian response, there is usually regional lymphadenopathy and there may be
systemic manifestations of fever and malaise. Primary vaccination with DRYVAX* at a potency
of 100 million pock-forming units (pfu)/ml has been shown to elicit a 97% response rate by both
major reaction and neutralizing antibody response in children.
                                                              14
9770469_1 (GHMattem) P97653.AU.1

[00511                     Yet another example of a licensed live attenuated vaccine is YF-VAX* for
treatment of yellow fever virus infections. YF-VAX® is prepared by culturing the 17D strain of
yellow fever virus in living avian leukosis virus-free chicken embryos. YF-VAX* is lyophilized
and sealed under nitrogen for storage and is reconstituted immediately prior to use. YF-VAX* is
formulated to contain not less than 5.04 Logio pfu per 0.5 ml dose. Typically, immunity to
yellow fever develops by the tenth day after primary vaccination with YF-VAX*. Although it
has been demonstrated that yellow fever vaccine immunity can persist for at least 30-3 5 years,
and in some cases for life, booster vaccinations are required at intervals of 10 years in order to
boost antibody titer.
[0052]                     Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), also known as
blue-ear pig disease is a virus that causes a disease of pigs, called porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome (PRRS). This economically important, pandemic disease causes
reproductive failure in breeding stock and respiratory tract illness in young pigs. A live
attenuated vaccine has been developed to prevent PRRS.
[00531                     Pseudorabies is a viral disease in swine that is endemic in most parts of the world.
It is caused by Suid herpesvirus 1 (SuHV-1), which is also called Pseudorabies virus (PRV) and
is also known as Aujeszky's disease, and in cattle as mad itch. Other domestic and wild
mammals, such as cattle, sheep, goats, cats, dogs, and raccoons, are also susceptible where the
disease is usually fatal. Research on PRV in pigs has pioneered animal disease control with live
attenuated vaccines. Although the word "pseudorabies" means "false rabies," or "rabies-like," it
is a misnomer. Pseudorabies is related to the herpes virus, not the rabies virus.
TherapeuticProteins
[0054]                     Many therapeutic proteins (including a number of thermolabile therapeutic
proteins) are currently licensed or in development and may be used in accordance with the
present disclosure.
[0055]                     As used herein, the term "protein" refers to a polymer of amino acids. In some
embodiments, proteins may include moieties other than amino acids (e.g., may be glycoproteins,
                                                             15
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

proteoglycans, lipoproteins, etc.) and/or may be otherwise processed or modified. Those of
ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a "protein" can be a complete polypeptide chain as
produced by a cell (with or without a signal sequence), or can be a portion thereof. Those of
ordinary skill will appreciate that a protein can sometimes include more than one polypeptide
chain, for example linked by one or more disulfide bonds or associated by other means.
Polypeptides may contain L-amino acids, D-amino acids, or both and may contain any of a
variety of amino acid modifications or analogs known in the art.
[00561                     Therapeutic proteins are proteins that are either extracted from human cells or
engineered in the laboratory for pharmaceutical use. The majority of therapeutic proteins are
recombinant human proteins manufactured using non-human mammalian cell lines that are
engineered to express certain human genetic sequences to produce specific proteins.
Recombinant proteins are an important class of therapeutics used, for example, to replace
deficiencies in critical blood borne growth factors and to strengthen the immune system to fight
cancer and infectious disease. Therapeutic proteins are also used to relieve patients' suffering
from many conditions, including various cancers (treated by monoclonal antibodies and
interferons), heart attacks, strokes, cystic fibrosis and Gaucher's disease (treated by enzymes and
blood factors), diabetes (treated by insulin), anemia (treated by erythropoietins), and hemophilia
(treated by blood clotting factors).
[0057]                     The FDA has approved 75 therapeutic proteins, also known as
biopharmaceuticals, and there are more than 500 additional proteins under development.
Therapeutic biological products currently under regulatory review include: monoclonal
antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, immunomodulators; and thrombolytics and
proteins intended for therapeutic use that are extracted from animals or microorganisms,
including recombinant versions of these products and other non-vaccine therapeutic
immunotherapies.
[00581                     In some embodiments, a therapeutic protein is an antibody. As used herein, the
term "antibody" is intended to include immunoglobulins and fragments thereof which are
specifically reactive to the designated protein or peptide, or fragments thereof. Suitable
antibodies include, but are not limited to, human antibodies, primatized antibodies, chimeric
                                                            16
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

antibodies, bi-specific antibodies, humanized antibodies, conjugated antibodies (i.e., antibodies
conjugated or fused to other proteins, radiolabels, cytotoxins), Small Modular
ImmunoPharmaceuticals ("SMIPs TM"), single chain antibodies, cameloid antibodies, antibody
like molecules, and antibody fragments. As used herein, the term "antibodies" also includes
intact monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, single domain antibodies (e.g., shark single
domain antibodies (e.g., IgNAR or fragments thereof)), multispecific antibodies (e.g., bi-specific
antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, and antibody fragments so long as they
exhibit the desired biological activity. Antibodies may be of any type (e.g., IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG,
IgM).
[0059]                     In some embodiments, a therapeutic protein is an antibody fragment. As used
herein, an "antibody fragment" includes a portion of an intact antibody, such as, for example, the
antigen-binding or variable region of an antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab,
Fab' , F(ab' )2, Fc and Fv fragments; triabodies; tenbodies; linear antibodies; single-chain
antibody molecules; and multi specific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. The term
"antibody fragment" also includes any synthetic or genetically engineered protein that acts like
an antibody by binding to a specific antigen to form a complex. For example, antibody
fragments include isolated fragments, "Fv" fragments, consisting of the variable regions of the
heavy and light chains, recombinant single chain polypeptide molecules in which light and heavy
chain variable regions are connected by a peptide linker ("ScFv proteins"), and minimal
recognition units consisting of the amino acid residues that mimic the hypervariable region.
[00601                     Some exemplary therapeutic proteins that may be used in accordance with the
present disclosure are listed in Table 3 below. One exemplary therapeutic protein is Herceptin@
(trastuzumab), a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular component of
the Her2/neu receptor, a 185 kDa transmembrane oncoprotein that is overexpressed in
approximately 20 to 25% of breast cancer patients. The antibody and other biosimilars are
designed to express the human Fc-Gamma-1 isotype to increase both Complement Dependent
Cytotoxicity (CDC) and Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) function of the
antibody. The Fab-related function of trastuzumab enables high affinity binding to the
extracellular domain of the Her2/neu receptor which inhibits cell proliferation and prevents
angiogenesis.

Polynucleotides
[00611                     Polynucleotides may also be used in accordance with the present disclosure. As
used herein, the term "polynucleotide" refers to a polymer of nucleotides. The polymer may
include natural nucleosides (i.e., adenosine, thymidine, guanosine, cytidine, uridine,
deoxyadenosine, deoxythymidine, deoxyguanosine, and deoxycytidine), nucleoside analogs (e.g.,
2-aminoadenosine, 2-thiothymidine, inosine, pyrrolo-pyrimidine, 3-methyl adenosine, 5
methylcytidine, C5-bromouridine, C5-fluorouridine, C5-iodouridine, C5-propynyl-uridine,
C5-propynyl-cytidine, C5-methylcytidine, 7-deazaadenosine, 7-deazaguanosine,
8-oxoadenosine, 8-oxoguanosine, 0(6)-methylguanine, 4-acetylcytidine, 5
(carboxyhydroxymethyl)uridine, dihydrouridine, methylpseudouridine, 1-methyl adenosine, 1
methyl guanosine, N6-methyl adenosine, and 2-thiocytidine), chemically modified bases,
biologically modified bases (e.g., methylated bases), intercalated bases, modified sugars (e.g., 2'
fluororibose, ribose, 2'-deoxyribose, 2'-0-methylcytidine, arabinose, and hexose), or modified
phosphate groups (e.g., phosphorothioates and 5' -N-phosphoramidite linkages).
[0062]                     In some embodiments, a polynucleotide used in accordance with the present
disclosure is DNA, RNA, an aptamer, shRNA, siRNA, miRNA, and/or antisense RNA, or
antagomir RNA.
Polysaccharides
[00631                     Polysaccharides may also be used in accordance with the present disclosure. As
used herein, the term "polysaccharide" refers to a polymer of sugars. The polymer may include
natural sugars (e.g., arabinose, lyxose, ribose, xylose, ribulose, xylulose, allose, altrose,
galactose, glucose, gulose, idose, mannose, talose, fructose, psicose, sorbose, tagatose,
mannoheptulose, sedoheptulose, octolose, and sialose) and/or modified sugars (e.g., 2'
fluororibose, 2'-deoxyribose, and hexose).

Small Molecules
[0064]                     As noted previously, while the methods and compositions of the present
disclosure are thought to be particularly useful for thermolabile agents it is to be understood that
in some embodiments, they may be used with more stable agents including traditional small
molecule therapeutics. Many therapeutic small molecules have been developed and may be used
in accordance with the present disclosure. As used herein, the term "small molecule therapeutic"
refers to a non-polymeric therapeutic molecule that may contain several carbon-carbon bonds
and have a molecular weight of less than about 1500 Da (e.g., less than about 1000 Da, less than
about 500 Da or less than about 200 Da). A small molecule therapeutic can be synthesized in a
laboratory (e.g., by combinatorial synthesis, using an engineered microorganism, etc.) or can be
found in nature (e.g., a natural product). In general, a small molecule therapeutic may alter,
inhibit, activate, or otherwise affect a biological event. For example, small molecule
therapeutics may include, but are not limited to, anti-AIDS substances, anti-cancer substances,
antibiotics, anti-diabetic substances, immunosuppressants, anti-viral substances, enzyme
inhibitors, neurotoxins, opioids, hypnotics, anti-histamines, lubricants, tranquilizers, anti
convulsants, muscle relaxants and anti-Parkinson substances, anti-spasmodics and muscle
contractants including channel blockers, miotics and anti-cholinergics, anti-glaucoma
compounds, anti-parasite and/or anti-protozoal compounds, modulators of cell-extracellular
matrix interactions including cell growth inhibitors and anti-adhesion molecules, vasodilating
agents, inhibitors of DNA, RNA or protein synthesis, anti-hypertensives, analgesics, anti
pyretics, steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, anti-angiogenic factors, anti
secretory factors, anticoagulants and/or anti-thrombotic agents, local anesthetics, ophthalmics,
prostaglandins, anti-depressants, anti-psychotic substances, anti-emetics, and imaging agents. A

II. Methods of preparing compositions
[0066]                     In another aspect, the present disclosure provides methods for preparing
compositions including the aforementioned compositions. The specific method used may
depend on the nature of the therapeutic agent, the nature of the lipid component, whether vesicles
will be formed and whether these vesicles will be formed in the presence or absence of the
therapeutic agent.
Compositions with pre-formed vesicles
[0067]                     In the case of compositions that comprise pre-formed vesicles, the vesicles may
be prepared in accordance with any known method and then combined with the therapeutic agent
to produce a composition. For example, an exemplary technique is the rotary film evaporation
method, in which a film of the vesicle-forming lipids is prepared by rotary evaporation from an
organic solvent, e.g., a hydrocarbon or chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent such as chloroform, e.g.,
see Russell and Alexander, J. Immunol. 140:1274, 1988. The resulting thin film is then
rehydrated in bicarbonate buffer to produce the vesicles.
[00681                     Another method involves hydration in the presence of shearing forces. An
apparatus that can be used to apply such shearing forces is a well known, suitable equipment
(see, e.g., PCT Publication No. W088/06882). Sonication and ultra-sonication are also effective
means to form the vesicles or to alter their particle size.
[00691                     Another method for the production of vesicles is that disclosed by Collins et al., J.
Pharm.Pharmacol.42:53, 1990. This method involves melting a mixture of the vesicle-forming
lipids and hydrating with vigorous mixing in the presence of aqueous buffer.
                                                             23
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

[00701                     It is to be understood that other methods, including other melt methods and spray
injection methods that are described below may also be used to prepare pre-formed vesicles.
Other compositions
[0071]                     When vesicles are formed in the presence of the therapeutic agent these are
preferably (but not necessarily) prepared by one of the following melt or spray injection
methods. Compositions that do not necessarily contain vesicles (e.g., compositions that are
prepared using lipid components that consist of a non-ionic surfactant such as MPG or a non
ionic surfactant and a steroid such as MPG/cholesterol) may also be prepared in this manner
even though they may not necessarily form vesicles. As discussed elsewhere, these methods
avoid exposing the therapeutic agent to organic solvents and high temperatures. Without
wishing to be limited to any theory, these methods are therefore thought to minimize any damage
to the therapeutic agent (and hence loss in potency) that might result from other formulation
methods.
Melt Method - Standard
[0072]                     In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods that involve
melting the lipid(s) of the lipid component and then mixing them with the therapeutic agent. In
some embodiments these methods include steps of providing a molten mixture of the one or
more lipids and then adding an aqueous solution comprising the therapeutic agent to the molten
mixture (standard melt method). In some embodiments the lipids form into vesicles when added
to the aqueous solution.
[00731                     It is to be understood that a molten mixture of one or more lipids may be obtained
in any manner, e.g., lipid(s) are melted to form a molten mixture. In some embodiments, lipid(s)
are melted at a temperature range between 120'C and 150'C (e.g., between 120'C and 125'C,
between 120'C and 130'C, between 120'C and 140'C, between 130'C and 140'C, between
 135'C and 145'C, or between 140'C and 145'C).
                                                             24
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

[00741                     In some embodiments, the mixture produced by adding the antigen solution to the
molten mixture of lipid(s) is placed under temperature-controlled conditions of less than 60 0 C,
e.g., less than 55 0 C, less than 50 0 C, less than 450C, less than 40 0 C, less than 350 C, less than
300 C, less than 25 0 C or even less than 20 0 C. In some embodiments, the molten mixture lipid(s)
may be placed under the temperature-controlled conditions (e.g., using a water bath) just before
the antigen solution is added. Alternatively, the antigen solution may be added to the molten
mixture of lipid(s) and the resulting mixture can then be placed under temperature-controlled
conditions. In some embodiments, the mixture produced by adding the antigen solution to the
molten mixture of lipid(s) is placed under temperature-controlled conditions in the range of 20
60 0 C, e.g., 20-50 0 C, 20-400 C, 20-30 0 C, 30-60 0 C, 30-50 0 C, 30-40 0 C, 40-60 0 C, 40-50 0 C, or 50
60 0 C. It is to be understood that terms "temperature-controlled conditions" does not require the
temperature to be fixed at a particular temperature but simply that the temperature remain within
a range (e.g., ±1 C, ±20 C, ±50 C, ±10 C, etc. from some value) or that the temperature remain
below or above a particular temperature.
[0075]                     In some embodiments, the aqueous solution comprising an antigen is at a
temperature of less than 50 0 C when added to the mixture of molten lipid(s), e.g., less than 450 C,
less than 40 0C, less than 350 C, less than 300 C, less than 25 0 C or even less than 20 0 C. In some
embodiments, the aqueous solution comprising an antigen is a temperature in the range of 20
60 0 C, e.g., 20-50 0 C, 20-400 C, 20-30 0 C, 30-60 0 C, 30-50 0 C, 30-40 0 C, 40-60 0 C, 40-50 0 C, or 50
60 0 C when added to the mixture of molten lipid(s). In some embodiments, the aqueous solution
comprising an antigen is placed under temperature-control before being added to the mixture of
molten lipid(s).
[00761                     In some embodiments, the molten mixture of lipid(s) is at a temperature that is no
more than 50 0 C above its melting point when the antigen solution is added. In some
embodiments, the molten mixture of lipid(s) is at a temperature that is no more than 45 0C, 40 0 C,
350 C, 300C, 25 0C, 20 0 C, 100 C, or 50 C above its melting point when the antigen solution is
added. In some embodiments, the molten mixture of lipid(s) is at a temperature that is no more
than 5-50 0 C, e.g., 5-400 C, 5-30 0 C, 5-20 0 C, 5-10 0 C, 10-50 0 C, 10-40 0 C, 10-30 0 C, or 10-20 0 C
above its melting point when the antigen solution is added. For example, in some embodiments,
                                                         25

the molten mixture of lipid(s) is at a temperature of less than 1 10 C, less than 100 C, less than
90 0 C, or less than 80 0 C when the antigen solution is added.
Melt Method - Inverted
[0077]                     In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods that involve
melting the lipid(s) of the lipid component and then adding the mixture of molten lipid(s) to the
aqueous solution comprising a therapeutic agent (inverted melt method). In some embodiments
the lipids form into vesicles when added to the aqueous solution.
[00781                     In some embodiments, the aqueous solution comprising a therapeutic agent is at a
temperature of less than 50 0 C when the mixture of molten lipids is added, e.g., less than 450 C,
less than 40 0C, less than 350 C, less than 300 C, less than 25 0 C or even less than 20 0 C. In some
embodiments, the aqueous solution comprising a prophylactic and/or therapeutic agent is a
temperature in the range of 20-60 0 C, e.g., 20-50 0 C, 20-400 C, 20-30 0 C, 30-600 C, 30-50 0 C, 30
40 0 C, 40-60 0 C, 40-50 0 C, or 50-60 0 C when the mixture of molten lipid(s) is added. In some
embodiments, the aqueous solution comprising a therapeutic agent is under temperature-control.
[0079]                     In some embodiments, the molten mixture of lipid(s) is at a temperature in the
range between 120'C and 150'C (e.g., between 120'C and 125'C, between 120'C and 130'C,
between 120'C and 140'C, between 130'C and 140'C, between 135'C and 145'C, or between
 140'C and 145'C) when added to the aqueous solution.
[00801                     In some embodiments, the molten mixture of lipid(s) is at a temperature that is no
more than 50 0 C above its melting point when added to the aqueous solution. In some
embodiments, the molten mixture of lipid(s) is at a temperature that is no more than 450C, 40 0 C,
350 C, 300 C, 25 0C, 20 0 C, 100 C, or 50 C above its melting point when added to the aqueous
solution. In some embodiments, the molten mixture of lipid(s) is at a temperature that is no more
than 5-50 0 C, e.g., 5-400 C, 5-30 0 C, 5-20 0 C, 5-10 0 C, 10-50 0 C, 10-40 0 C, 10-30 0 C, or 10-20 0 C
above its melting point when added to the aqueous solution. For example, in some
embodiments, the molten mixture of lipid(s) is at a temperature of less than 120 0 C, less than
 1 10 C, less than 100 C, or less than 90 0 C, when added to the aqueous solution.

Solvent Injection Methods
[00811                     In some embodiments, compositions may be prepared using a solvent injection
method. For example, in some embodiments, the methods may involve providing a solution of
one or more lipids and adding the solution of lipids to an aqueous solution comprising
therapeutic agent by injection.
[0082]                     Solvent injection methods may offer some advantages over other preparation
methods, e.g., those methods involving high temperature or pressure methods, since the lipid(s)
may be dissolved in organic solutions under temperature controlled conditions. Furthermore,
high pressure homogenization can be avoided using solvent injection methods.
[00831                     In some embodiments, the mixture produced by injecting the solution of one or
more lipids into the aqueous solution comprising a therapeutic agent is placed under
temperature-controlled conditions of less than 55 0 C, e.g., less than 50 0 C, less than 450 C, less than
40 0 C, less than 350 C, less than 300C, less than 25 0 C or even less than 200 C. In some
embodiments, the mixture produced by injecting the solution of one or more lipids into the
aqueous solution comprising a therapeutic agent is placed under temperature-controlled
conditions in the range of 20-55 0 C, e.g., 20-50 0 C, 20-40 0 C, 20-30 0 C, 30-55 0 C, 30-50 0 C, 30-40 0 C,
40-55 0 C, 40-50 0 C, or 50-55 0 C.
[0084]                     In some embodiments, the aqueous solution comprising a prophylactic therapeutic
agent is at a temperature of less than 50 0 C prior to injection of the solution of one or more lipids,
e.g., less than 450 C, less than 40 0 C, less than 350C, less than 300 C, less than 25 0 C or even less
than 20 0 C. In some embodiments, the aqueous solution comprising a therapeutic agent is a
temperature in the range of 20-60 0 C, e.g., 20-50 0 C, 20-400 C, 20-30 0 C, 30-60 0 C, 30-50 0 C, 30
40 0 C, 30-35 0 C, 40-60 0 C, or 40-50 0 C prior to injection of the solution of one or more lipids. In
some embodiments, the aqueous solution comprising a therapeutic agent is placed under
temperature-control prior to injection of the solution of one or more lipids.
[0085]                     In some embodiments, the solution of one or more lipids is at a temperature of
less than 90 0C when it is injected into the aqueous solution comprising a therapeutic agent, e.g.,
less than 80 0C, less than 70 0C, less than 65 0 C, less than 60 0C, or less than 55 0 C. In some
                                                          27
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

embodiments, the solution of one or more lipids is at a temperature in the range of 50-90 0 C when
it is injected into the aqueous solution comprising a therapeutic agent, e.g., 50-80 0 C, 50-700 C,
50-65 0 C, 50-60 0 C, 50-55 0 C, 55-80 0 C, 55-70 0 C, 55-65 0 C, or 55-60 0 C.
[0086]                     Various solvent injection methods have been disclosed and can be adapted in
accordance with the present disclosure. For example, solvent injection methods in which lipids
were dissolved in diethyl ether are discussed in Syan et al. (Nanoparticle vesicular systems: A
versatile tool for drug delivery, J. Chemical and Pharmaceutical Research 2(2):496, 2010). In
another example, solvent injection methods in which lipids were dissolved in ethanol are
discussed in Wagner et al. (Liposome Technology for Industrial Purposes, J. Drug Delivery;
Volume 2011, Article ID 591325). In a further example, tert-butyl alcohol was used to dissolve
lipids as described by Wang et al. (Colloids and Surfaces V: Biointerfaces 79:254, 2010). See
also the methods in Schubert M.A. et al. (European Journal of Pharmaceutics and
Biopharmaceutics 55:125-131, 2003).
[00871                     In some embodiments, the lipid(s) are dissolved in an organic solvent. In some
embodiments, the solvent is an ether solvent, e.g., diethyl ether. In some embodiments, the
solvent is a polar-protic water-miscible organic solvent. Protic solvents are solvents that contain
dissociable protons (e.g., a hydrogen atom bound to an oxygen as in a hydroxyl group or a
nitrogen as in an amine group). In some embodiments, the polar-protic water-miscible organic
solvent is an aliphatic alcohol having 2-5 carbon atoms (e.g., 2 carbon atoms, 3 carbon atoms, 4
carbon atoms, or 5 carbon atoms). In some embodiments, the solvent is tert-butanol. In some
embodiments, the solvent is ethanol.
[00881                     In some embodiments, the one or more lipids are dissolved in a polar-protic
water-miscible organic solvent without any co-solvents present. In some embodiments, the one
or more lipids are dissolved in a polar-protic water-miscible organic solvent with one or more
co-solvents present. In some embodiments, one or more of the co-solvents are also polar-protic
water-miscible organic solvents. In some embodiments, the polar-protic water-miscible organic
solvent makes up at least 70% v/v of the solvent system, e.g., at least 75%, 80%, 90%, 95% or
99%. In some embodiments, the one or more lipids are dissolved in a water-free solvent system.
In some embodiments, the one or more lipids are dissolved in a solvent system that includes an
                                                           28
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

amount of water such that vesicles do not form. In some embodiments, the one or more lipids
are dissolved in a solvent system that includes less than 5% v/v water, e.g., less than 4%, 3%,
2%,     1 %,    0.5%, or 0.1%.
Lyophilization
[00891                     In some embodiments, a composition of the present disclosure may be lyophilized
for future use and subsequently hydrated prior to use.
[0090]                     Lyophilization involves freezing the composition and then reducing the
surrounding pressure (and optionally heating the preparation) to allow the frozen solvent(s) to
sublime directly from the solid phase to gas (i.e., drying phase). In some embodiments, the
drying phase is divided into primary and secondary drying phases.
[0091]                     The freezing phase can be done by placing the composition in a container (e.g., a
flask, eppendorf tube, etc.) and optionally rotating the container in a bath which is cooled by
mechanical refrigeration (e.g., using dry ice and methanol, liquid nitrogen, etc.). In some
embodiments, the freezing step involves cooling the composition to a temperature that is below
the eutectic point of the composition. Since the eutectic point occurs at the lowest temperature
where the solid and liquid phase of the composition can coexist, maintaining the material at a
temperature below this point ensures that sublimation rather than evaporation will occur in
subsequent steps.
[0092]                     The drying phase (or the primary drying phase when two drying phases are used)
involves reducing the pressure and optionally heating the preparation to a point where the
solvent(s) can sublimate. This drying phase typically removes the majority of the solvent(s)
from the composition. It will be appreciated that the freezing and drying phases are not
necessarily distinct phases but can be combined in any manner. For example, in some
embodiments, the freezing and drying phases may overlap.
[00931                     A secondary drying phase can optionally be used to remove residual solvent(s)
that was adsorbed during the freezing phase. Without wishing to be bound to any theory, this
phase involves raising the temperature to break any physico-chemical interactions that have
                                                           29
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

formed between the solvent molecules and the frozen preparation. Once the drying phase is
complete, the vacuum can be broken with an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen or helium) before the
lyophilized product is optionally sealed.
[0094]                     In some embodiments, the lyophilized product is substantially free of organic
solvent(s).
[0095]                     Excipients such as sucrose, amino acids or proteins such as gelatin or serum
albumin may be used to further protect the therapeutic agent during the drying process and
storage. In some embodiments, a lyoprotectant may be used to protect the therapeutic agent
during lyophilization. Exemplary lyoprotectants include sucrose, trehalose, polyethylene glycol
(PEG), dimethyl-succinate buffer (DMS), bovine serum albumin (BSA), mannitol, sorbitol, and
dextran. Any suitable amount and/or combination of lyoprotectant(s) may be used to protect the
antigen. For example, as demonstrated in U.S. Patent 6,290,967, the dual presence of a
disaccharide (e.g., sucrose) and a 6-carbon polyhydric alcohol (e.g., a sorbitol) enhanced the
stability of a vaccine composition compared to control compositions. Sucrose was added in an
amount ranging from 10 to 70 grams per liter of vaccine, and sorbitol was added in an amount
ranging from about 15 to 90 grams per liter of vaccine.
Rehydration
[00961                     Once a composition has been lyophilized (and optionally stored), the methods of
the present disclosure may include a step of rehydrating the lyophilized product. In some
embodiments, this is achieved by mixing the lyophilized product with an aqueous solution.
[0097]                     In some embodiments, the aqueous solution includes a buffer. The buffer used
will typically depend on the nature of the therapeutic agent. For example, without limitation, a
PCB buffer, an Na 2HPO 4/NaH 2PO 4 buffer, a PBS buffer, a bicine buffer, a Tris buffer, a HEPES
buffer, a MOPS buffer, etc. may be used. PCB buffer is produced by mixing sodium propionate,
sodium cacodylate, and bis-Tris propane in the molar ratios 2:1:2. Varying the amount of HCl
added enables buffering over a pH range from 4-9. In some embodiments, a carbonate buffer
may be used.
                                                           30
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

[00981                     In some embodiments, a composition may be lyophilized for future use and
subsequently hydrated (e.g., with sterile water or an aqueous buffer) prior to use. In some
embodiments, a composition may be stored at -80'C prior to lyophilization.
[0099]                     In some embodiments, the rehydrated composition exhibits substantially the same
potency as the composition prior to lyophilization.
[0100]                     In some embodiments, the rehydrated composition exhibits at least about 50% of
the potency as the composition prior to lyophilization (e.g., at least about 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%,
75%, 8 0%,           8
                       5%, 9 0%, 95% or  99
                                            %). In some embodiments, the level of potency is based on
measurements of IC 50 or EC50 (or some other measure of potency, e.g., TCID50 based on an in
vitro microtitration assay in the case of an MMR vaccine based composition). In some
embodiments, the level of potency is based on a plaque assay measurement.
[0101]                     In some embodiments, the rehydrated composition exhibits at least 1.5 fold
greater potency as compared to an otherwise equivalent composition that was formulated without
the lipid component (e.g., at least about 2 fold, 2.5 fold, 3 fold, 3.5 fold, 4 fold or 5 fold). In
some embodiments, the level of potency is based on measurements of IC5 0 or EC 50 (or some
other measure of potency, e.g., TCID50 based on an in vitro microtitration assay in the case of an
MMR vaccine based composition). In some embodiments, the level of potency is based on a
plaque assay measurement.
Storage
[0102]                     In some embodiments, the lyophilized composition may be stored for a period of
time (e.g., days, weeks or months) prior to rehydration and administration to a subject in need
thereof. In some embodiments, the lyophilized composition is exposed to temperatures in excess
of 80 C during storage (e.g., temperatures in excess of 10 C, 150C , 200 C , 25 0C , 300C, 350 C, or
40 0 C, temperatures in the range of 10 C to 40 0C, temperatures in the range of 20 0C to 40 0 C,
temperatures in the range of 30 C to 40 0C, temperatures in the range of 10 C to 30 C,
temperatures in the range of 20 0 C to 300C, room temperature, etc.). In some embodiments, the
lyophilized composition is stored under conditions that are not temperature controlled.
                                                         31
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

[01031                     In some embodiments, the lyophilized compositions are thermostable in that the
potency of the composition remains substantially unchanged during storage despite being
exposed to temperatures in excess of 80 C (e.g., temperatures in excess of 10 C, 150 C , 20 0 C ,
25 0 C , 300 C, 350C, or 40 0 C, temperatures in the range of 10 C to 40 0C, temperatures in the range
of 20 0 C to 40 0 C, temperatures in the range of 30 C to 40 0C, temperatures in the range of 100 C to
300 C, temperatures in the range of 20 0 C to 300C, 37 0C, room temperature, etc.) for a period of 1
to 6 months (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 months, 12 weeks, etc.).
[0104]                     In some embodiments, storage of the lyophilized composition at these elevated
temperatures destroys less than 20% of the potency of the composition (e.g., less than 15%, less
than 10%, less than 5%, less than 1%) as measured in a potency assay and as compared to an
equivalent lyophilized composition that was stored between 2 and 8'C for the same time period.
[0105]                     In some embodiments, the potency of the composition post-storage is at least 1.5
fold greater than in an otherwise equivalent lyophilized composition that was stored under the
same elevated temperatures but that was formulated without the lipid component (e.g., at least
about 2 fold, 2.5 fold, 3 fold, 3.5 fold, 4 fold or 5 fold). In some embodiments, the level of
potency is based on measurements of IC 50 or EC 50 (or some other measure of potency, e.g.,
TCID50 based on an in vitro microtitration assay in the case of an MMR vaccine based
composition). In some embodiments, the level of potency is based on a plaque assay
measurement.
[01061                     In some embodiments, one or more of these potency results are obtained when the
lyophilized composition is stored at 25 0 C for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 months. In some embodiments,
these results are obtained when the lyophilized composition is stored at 15 0 C, 20 0 C, 300 C, 350 C,
37 0C or 40 0C for 1 month. In some embodiments, these results are obtained when the
lyophilized composition is stored at 15 0 C, 20 0 C, 300 C, 350 C, 37 0C or 40 0C for 2 months. In
some embodiments, these results are obtained when the lyophilized composition is stored at 15
0C,   20 0C, 300 C, 350 C, 37 0C or 40 0C for 3 months (or 12 weeks). In some embodiments, these
results are obtained when the lyophilized composition is stored at 15 0 C, 20 0 C, 300 C, 350 C, 37 0 C
or 40 0 C for 4 months. In some embodiments, these results are obtained when the lyophilized
composition is stored at 150C, 20 0C, 300 C, 350 C, 37 0C or 40 0C for 5 months. In some
                                                         32
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

embodiments, these results are obtained when the lyophilized composition is stored at 150 C,
20 0 C, 300 C, 350C, 37 0C or 40 0C for 6 months. In some embodiments these temperatures may be
allowed to vary within a range, e.g., ± 2 0C.
III. Dosage and administration
[0107]                     The compositions and methods of this disclosure are useful for treating humans
including adults and children. In general, however, compositions and methods of the present
disclosure may be used with any animal. In some embodiments, compositions and methods
herein may be used for veterinary applications, e.g., canine and feline applications. If desired,
compositions and methods herein may also be used with farm animals, such as ovine, avian,
bovine, porcine and equine breeds.
[01081                     Compositions described herein will generally be administered in such amounts
and for such a time as is necessary or sufficient to induce a therapeutic response (e.g., a
therapeutically effective amount). Dosing regimens may consist of a single dose or a plurality of
doses over a period of time. The exact amount of a composition to be administered may vary
from subject to subject and may depend on several factors. Thus, it will be appreciated that, in
general, the precise dose used will be as determined by the prescribing physician and will depend
not only on the weight of the subject and the route of administration, but also on the age of the
subject and the severity of the symptoms and/or the risk of infection.
[0109]                     In some embodiments, the dose of viral antigen in an immunogenic composition
is sufficient to yield TCID50 values that are comparable to those in a licensed vaccine. For
example, the licensed M-M-R-II" vaccine includes at least 1000 TCID50 measles virus, at least
5000 TCID50 mumps virus and at least 1000 TCID5 o rubella virus. TCID50 (50% tissue culture
infectious dose) quantifies the amount of virus required to infect 50% of inoculated tissue culture
cells. Typically, TCID50 values are measured by plating host cells (e.g., Vero cells) and adding
serial dilutions of the viral antigen. After incubation, the percentage of infected cells is manually
observed and recorded for each virus dilution, and results are used to mathematically calculate a
TCID50 value, e.g., according to the Behrens-Kirber method (Kirber, Arch Exp Pathol
Pharmakol 162:480-483, 1931).

[0110]                     In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is taken from a licensed human
product (e.g., a drug product or vaccine) and the composition is administered to a human at a
dose that is less than the standard human dose (e.g., in the range of 10-90%, 10-80%, 10-70%,
 10-60%, 10-50%, 10-40%, 10-30%, 10-20%, 20-90%, 20-80%, 20-70%, 20-60%, 20-50%, 20

80%, or 80-90% of the standard human dose).
[0111]                     In some embodiments the composition is administered as a single dose. In some
embodiments the composition is administered as more than one dose (e.g., 1-3 doses that are
separated by 1-12 months).
[0112]                     In some embodiments, the compositions may be formulated for delivery
parenterally, e.g., by injection. In such embodiments, administration may be, for example,
intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, or subcutaneous, or via by infusion or needleless
injection techniques. In some embodiments, the compositions may be formulated for
intramuscular delivery. In some embodiments, the compositions may be formulated for
subcutaneous delivery. For such parenteral administration, the compositions may be prepared
and maintained in conventional lyophilized compositions and reconstituted prior to
administration with a pharmaceutically acceptable saline solution, such as a 0.9% saline solution.
The pH of the injectable composition can be adjusted, as is known in the art, with a
pharmaceutically acceptable acid, such as methanesulfonic acid. Other acceptable vehicles and
solvents that may be employed include Ringer's solution and U.S.P. In addition, sterile, fixed
oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland
fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids
such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. The injectable compositions can be
sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating
sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in
sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.

                                                          Examples
[0113]                     The following examples describe some exemplary modes of making and
practicing certain compositions that are described herein. It should be understood that these
examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to limit the scope of the
compositions and methods described herein.
Example 1: Two-step inverted melt method
[0114]                     This example describes a two-step inverted melt method that was used to prepare
certain compositions (including compositions in which vesicles were formed in the presence of a
viral antigen).
[0115]                     In Step 1, a 5:4:1 molar ratio of the following lipids: 1-monopalmitoyl glycerol
(MPG), cholesterol (CHO) and dicetyl phosphate (DCP) was placed in a flat bottom 50 ml glass
beaker, ensuring none of the powder stuck to the side of the glass beaker. The lipids were melted
in a heated oil bath at about 120'C for 10 minutes, with occasional swirling in the glass beaker
covered with aluminum foil.
[01161                     At this stage, a stock solution of M-M-R-II" vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella
virus vaccine, live attenuated, Merck Frosst Std.) was pre-incubated for 5 minutes at about 30'C
in a heated water bath. In Step 2, the resulting M-M-R-II@ vaccine stock solution was
homogenized at an appropriate speed (e.g., at 8,000 rpm), the molten lipid mixture was added
into the homogenizing M-M-R-II@ vaccine stock solution, and homogenization was continued
for a further 30 seconds at about 30'C. The resulting homogenate was shaken for 30 minutes at
220 rpm and about 30'C. An equivalent volume of a 400 mM sucrose solution in 25 mM
sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.7) was added to the shaken homogenate and the homogenate
was further shaken for 5 minutes at 220 rpm at about 30 'C. This mixture was aliquoted and
frozen at -80'C, then lyophilized and reconstituted with 0.5 ml of sterile water for injection
(WFI) prior to use.

Example 2: Measles potency assays (TCID5 0 and Plaque)
[0117]                     A common test method that is used to quantitate the number of infectious
particles in live virus vaccines is the 50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose (TCIDso) assay. This
endpoint dilution assay quantifies the amount of virus required to kill 50% of infected hosts or to
produce a cytopathic effect in 50% of inoculated tissue culture cells. This assay may be more
common in clinical research applications where the lethal dose of virus must be determined or if
the virus does not form plaques (see discussion of alternative plaque assay below). In the
context of tissue culture, host cells are plated and serial dilutions of the virus are added. After
incubation, the percentage of cell death (i.e., infected cells) is manually observed and recorded
for each virus dilution, and results are used to mathematically calculate a TCID50 result. Due to
distinct differences in assay methods and principles, TCID5 o and pfu/ml (plaque assay result) or
other infectivity assay results are not equivalent. This method can take up to a week due to cell
infectivity time.
[01181                     Vero cells were used in these experiments to assess the potency of the measles
viruses in the reformulated M-M-R-II@ vaccines. Reformulated M-M-R-II@ vaccines prepared
in accordance with Example 1 were reconstituted after a period of storage (discussed below) in
water for injection. Vero cells were grown to 80% confluency in 96-well plates. 100 pl of
tenfold dilutions of the reformulated vaccine were added to wells starting with a 1/10 dilution
and doing seven additional 10 fold serial dilutions of the reformulated M-M-R-II@ vaccines in
culture medium. The virus titer quantifies the amount of virus required to produce a cytopathic
effect in 50% of inoculated tissue culture cells. Measles virus titer (TCIDso) was determined
after reconstitution as discussed above.
[0119]                     As mentioned above, another common test method that is used to quantitate the
number of infectious particles in live virus vaccines is the plaque assay. This test method is
based on the cytopathic effect of the virus in the vaccine on a susceptible cell line and is an in
vitro measure of the potency of the vaccine composition (Schalk et al., Journalof Virological
Methods 117:179-187, 2004).
[0120]                     Reformulated M-M-R-II@ vaccines prepared in accordance with Example 1 were
reconstituted after a period of storage (e.g., as discussed above) in water for injection. Since the
                                                           36
9770469_1 (GHMatter) P97653.AU.1

M-M-R-II@ vaccine is a trivalent vaccine, mumps and rubella viruses in the vaccine were
initially neutralized by the addition of anti-mumps and anti-rubella antiserum followed by
incubation at 4'C for one hour (the antisera were heat-inactivated at 56'C for 30 minutes prior to
addition). 100, 500, 1000, 2500 and 5000-fold serial dilutions of the reformulated M-M-R-II@
vaccines in culture medium were then prepared. Vero cells were grown to 90% confluency in 6
well plates. One day before infection, culture medium was refreshed. Cells were infected with
200 pl of each dilution (12 wells per dilution). After absorption of the virus for 45 minutes at
room temperature, cells received a 4 ml agar-overlay consisting of medium M199 (BioWhittaker
Europe) with 4.7% inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 0.11% NaHCO 3 and 0.33% agar.
The plates were inverted and incubated at 36'C and 2.5% CO 2. After 9 days, the agar-overlay
was removed and cells are fixed in 96% ethanol for 2 minutes. Subsequently, cells were stained
in carbol fuchsin and dried. Plaques were generally counted manually and results, in
combination with the dilution factor used to prepare the plate, were used to calculate the number
of plaque forming units per sample unit volume (pfu/ml). The pfu/ml result represents the
number of infective particles within the sample and is based on the assumption that each plaque
formed is representative of one infective virus particle.
Example 3: Comparison of viral antigen-containing vesicles and pre-formed vesicles admixed
with viral antigen: effect of lipid concentration on thermostability and liquid stability
[0121]                     This study was designed to evaluate the stabilization of non-ionic surfactant
vesicles (NISVs) containing live attenuated M-M-R-II@ formulated with different lipid
concentrations, buffers and sucrose using the inverted melt process as described in Example 1.
The study also compared formulating M-M-R-II@ into vesicles versus formulating M-M-R-II@
with pre-formed vesicles. The samples were stored at 5 ±3'C and 37±2'C. The commercial
vaccine M-M-R-II@ was used as a positive control for comparison. The TCID50 was used as an
in vitro test (as described in Example 2) to determine the vaccine potency following 1, 2 and 12
weeks of storage. The results were compared to the performance of the commercial vaccine to
evaluate the thermostable benefit of the reformulated samples.

[01221                     A 5:4:1 molar ratio of the lipids: monopalmitoyl glycerol (MPG), cholesterol
(CHO) and dicetyl phosphate (DCP) were placed in the bottom of a flat bottom glass beaker.
The lipids were melted in an oil bath at 120'C-1220 C with occasional mixing. M-M-R-II@
vaccine (reconstituted with supplied diluents) was warmed at 30'C-320 C for 5 minutes. The M
M-R-II@ vaccine solution was homogenized at 8000 rpm and the melted lipids were immediately
transferred into the vaccine solution, and warmed at 30'C-320 C. After homogenization (10
minutes for TA 8 and 9; 30 seconds for TA 1-7 and 10-12), the resulting mixture was mixed for
30 minutes at 220 rpm at 30'C-320 C. For certain samples, an equivalent volume of 400 mM
sucrose solution, optionally prepared with 25 mM of bicarbonate buffer or sterile water, was then
added. The prepared sample was mixed for another 5 minutes at 220 rpm at 30'C-320 C. For TA
4, the concentrated phosphate buffer was added to M-M-R-II@ vaccine solution prior to adding
melted lipid. The solution was aliquoted into 1.0 mL aliquots/vial (TA 1-4, 8, 9, 10, 11) and 0.5
mL (TA 5-7 and 12) followed by lyophilization. The lyophilized vials were stored at 5 ± 3C
and 37 ± 2'C. Each vial of lyophilized samples was reconstituted with 1.0 mL of sterile water
prior to Tissue Culture Infectious Dose5 0 (TCIDso) analysis. The samples for this stability study
are as described in the following Table 4.

[01231                     The lyophilized samples were collected from the temperature chamber. All
samples were coded and stored at 4'C before testing. The potency of measles component was
determined with an in vitro microtitration assay. The TCID50 assay estimated viable virus using
a streamlined endpoint dilution assay that was analyzed statistically. Briefly, serial dilutions of
these samples and the reference standard preparations were inoculated in rows of 10 wells of
microtiter plates, together with Vero cells (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells; ATCC
- CCL 81) used for 1, 2 and 12 week sample. The Vero cell line was initiated from the kidney of
a normal adult African green monkey. The microtitre plates were inoculated with 50 pL of Vero
cells in order to obtain 4.0 x 105 cells/mL titer in 24 hrs at 5% C02/370 C (75-80% cell
confluence is expected in these conditions). Each sample was reconstituted with 1000 pl of
sterile distilled water, mixed for 15 seconds by hand followed with vortex for 45 seconds on
medium speed (setting 5). The reconstituted samples (4 vials per time point) were transferred to
the microtitre plates within 5 minutes in undiluted and diluted form (10-1 to 10-7) on a 96- well
plate in quadruplicates (100 pL /well). Dilutions 10-1 to 10-7 were prepared in 24-well plates
completed with 5% FBS supplemented IMDM media and 100 pL was added to individual wells
in quadruplicates. Positive and negative controls were included (in house processed commercial
vaccine/commercial vaccine and cells, respectively). The plates were incubated at 35'C/5% CO 2
for 5 days. At the end of the incubation period, the numbers of the specific viral cytopathic
effect (CPE) were counted and recorded. The TCID5 0 per human dose was calculated according
to these criteria. TCID50 values were used to derive the geometric mean titers for statistical
analysis.
[0124]                     For statistical analysis of all the samples, the transformed variables were related
by using Prism 5 for windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) software to perform two
tailed unpaired t-test and detect p-value between the groups. Statistical significance is indicated
by a p-value between 0.05 to 0.01 and high statistical significance is indicated by a p-value less
than 0.01. TCID50 values were manipulated if the titre was identical for all the experiments in
one group, such that the titre was rounded to the fourth decimal point to avoid the software
limitation for nonparametric statistical analysis.

commercial vaccine (M-M-R-II@, TA 13) at both 5 ± 30 C and 37 ± 2 0 C. The container closure
system and the fill volume for TA 1 (1 mL of the reformulated proposed sample in 6 cc vials)
was different compared to TA 5 (0.5 mL filled into a 2 cc vial) but results obtained for TCID50
and physicochemical characterizations (data not shown) were comparable. The potency of TA 1,
5 and 8 stored over 1, 2 and 12 weeks at 5 ± 3 0 C and 37 ± 20 C was higher than the limit advised
by WHO (3.0 logio) (Figure 1). The reformulated samples with 25 mg/mL lipid did not show a
loss in potency over 12 weeks when stored at higher temperature (37 ± 20 C) whereas the
commercial vaccine potency decreased significantly (p<0.0001). The M-M-R-II@ vaccine added
to pre-formed NISV and formulated by the inverted melt method showed comparable TCID50
results. It was also observed that the non-lipid containing process control TA 10 and TA 12 were
not stable for more than one week when stored at higher temperature (37 ± 2C) (Figure 1, TA
 10). The TA 12 did not show stability at higher temperature after one week compared to the
commercial vaccine which was stable up to two weeks at 37 ± 2 0 C but showed a decrease after
 12 weeks. These results demonstrate a thermostable M-M-R-II@ vaccine with a lipid
concentration of 25 mg/mL (with or without sucrose and buffer) at elevated temperatures. At 5
3 C, the TA 1, 5 and 8, the process controls (TA 10 and 12) and the commercial M-M-R-II@
(TA 13) showed no loss in potency over 12 weeks of storage. TA 1, 5 and 8 stored at 37 ± 2 0 C,
maintained higher potency compared to the commercial vaccine.

TA 2 (1 ml of the reformulated proposed Test Article in 6 cc vials) was different compared to
TA 6 (0.5 ml filled into 2 cc vials). The appearance of TA 6 was more consistent throughout the

2'C) (Figure 2 for TA 10 and TA 11). TA 12 did not show a loss in potency at higher
temperature after one week compared to the commercial vaccine which was stable up to two
weeks at 37 ± 2'C. These results demonstrate a thermostable M-M-R-II@ vaccine with the lipid
concentration of 12.5 mg/ml. At 5 ± 3C, the samples (TA 2, 4, 6 and 9), process control (no
lipids) and the commercial vaccine showed stability up to 12 weeks. Samples formulated with
NISVs (TA 2, 4, 6 and 9) stored at both temperatures (5 ± 3C and 37 ± 2'C) maintained higher
potency compared to the 2 and 12 week old commercial vaccines.
[0127]                     In summary, the lyophilized samples containing M-M-R-II@ vaccine in NISVs
(12.5 or 25.0 mg/mL of lipid) prepared by inverted melt process had no change in potency over
 12 weeks storage at 5 ± 3C and 37 ± 2'C. The highest lipid concentration tested 25 mg/mL did
not appear to provide any additional benefit in maintaining potency compared to samples
containing lower lipid concentration (12.5 mg/ mL). The lyophilized sample containing M-M-R
II@ vaccine added to pre-formed NISVs had no loss in potency over 12 weeks storage at 5 ± 3C
and 37± 2C.
Example 4: Physical characterization of compositions prepared with different lipid
components
[01281                     The main objective of this study was to investigate the use of 1, 2
dipalmitoylphosphatidyl glycerol (DPPG) as an alternative anionic surfactant to DCP in lipid
M-M-R-II@ compositions prepared by the inverted melt method (as described in Example 1).
The secondary objective was to investigate excluding DCP or DPPG (and also CHO) in the M
M-R-II@ compositions.
[0129]                     A 5:4:1 molar ratio of the lipids: MPG, CHO and DCP or DPPG were placed in
the bottom of a flat bottom glass beaker. The lipids were melted in an oil bath at 120'C-122'C
(140'C for samples with DPPG) with occasional mixing. M-M-R-II@ vaccine (reconstituted
with supplied diluents) was warmed at 30'C-320 C for 5 minutes. The M-M-R-II@ vaccine
solution was homogenized at 8000 rpm and the melted lipids immediately transferred into the
                                                             42

vaccine solution, warmed at 30'C-320 C. After 30-40 seconds of homogenization, the mixture
was mixed for 30 minutes at 220 rpm at 30 0C-32 0 C. The solution was aliquoted into 0.5 mL/vial
(2 cc lyophilization vial) followed by lyophilization. The lyophilized vials were stored at 2-8'C
after lyophilization. Each vial of lyophilized sample was reconstituted with 0.5 mL of distilled
water (GIBCO) prior to analysis. TA 5, the M-M-R-II@ in-process control, was prepared by
putting hydrated M-M-R-II@ commercial vaccine through the inverted melt process in the
absence of lipids. TA 6, the commercial vaccine control remained as a lyophilized powder until
analysis. The samples for this study are as described in the following Table 5.

Zeta potential values for TA 1 (-48.5 mV) and 2 (-38.8 mV) containing anionic surfactant had
more negative values than those without anionic surfactants and non lipid controls (-5.68 to -16.7
mV). Microscopically, lipid vesicle particles (LPV) were observed for the samples containing
surfactants (TA 1 and 2, data not shown). However, visible aggregates of lipid particles were
seen in the non-surfactant containing samples (TA 3 and 4). No visible lipid particles were seen
in the non lipid containing controls (TA 5 and 6). Light yellow lyophilized cakes were observed
for all of the samples (see Table 6).
Example 5: Use of an Anionic Surfactant in Vesicles and pre-formed Vesicles with an
Exemplary Therapeutic Protein
[0132]                     The main objective of this study was to investigate the use of 1, 2
Dipalmitoylphosphatidyl Glycerol (DPPG) as an alternative anionic surfactant to DCP in NISV
formulations prepared by Inverted Melt Method (as described in Example 1) with an exemplary
therapeutic protein (trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that interferes with the HER2/neu
receptor). The secondary objective was to investigate whether admixing the therapeutic protein
with pre-formed anionic surfactant vesicles can impart thermostability.
[01331                     A 5:4:1 molar ratio of the lipids: MPG, CHO and DPPG were placed in the
bottom of a flat bottom glass beaker. The lipids were melted in an oil bath at 140'C with
occasional mixing. Dialyzed trastuzumab solution (buffer exchanged with 5% sucrose in 25 mM
Tris and 25 mM of Sodium-Citrate buffer, pH 6.5) was warmed at 320 C-350 C for 5-10 minutes.
The trastuzumab solution was homogenized at 8000 rpm and the melted lipids immediately
transferred into the therapeutic protein solution, warmed at 30'C-320 C. After 2 minutes of
homogenization, the liposome mixture was mixed for 15-30 minutes at 220 rpm at 300C-350C in
an incubator shaker. The solution was aliquoted into 0.5 mL/vial (2 cc lyophilization vial)
followed by lyophilization. The lyophilized vials were stored at 2-8'C after lyophilization. Each
vial of lyophilized Test Article was reconstituted with 0.5 mL of WFI water. Pre-formed
vesicles were similarly made except that the homogenization step occurs with buffer only and the
trastuzumab was admixed to the pre-formed vesicles after formulation rather than during
formulation. The Test Articles for this stability study are as described in the following Table 7.

Example 6: Comparison of Thermostability of an Exemplary Therapeutic Protein in Anionic
Surfactant Vesicles or admixed with pre-formed Vesicles
[0134]                     The purity and potency of trastuzumab formulated in NISV' s was evaluated after
8 weeks storage at two temperatures (50 C±30 C and 370 C±20 C) using a Size Exclusion
Chromatography (SEC) procedure to determine percent purity and a BT-474 anti-proliferation
biological potency assay. A validated potency assay for trastuzumab is the BT-474 inhibition of
proliferation bioassay. This assay measures the activity of the Fab binding affinity. The
principle of the trastuzumab inhibition of proliferation bioassay is that the relevant target cell
line, typically BT-474 cells are prepared in cell plates using a procedure designed to optimize
receptor expression. A dilution series of trastuzumab is then prepared, added to the plate and
allowed to bind to the BT-474 cells for a period of time. Sample results are reported as a percent
of inhibition of cell growth or as a relative potency measurement against a reference standard.
The results were compared to the performance of the unformulated therapeutic protein to
evaluate the thermostable benefit of the reformulations.
[0135]                     Figure 3 shows the SEC percent purity results of the Test Article LPV-1
(trastuzumab formulated with DPPG containing vesicles) versus the no-LPV control test article
(unformulated trastuzumab) for the evaluation of effect on thermostability at 8 weeks of storage
at 40'C versus 4'C. The no-LPV reference control showed a loss in % purity (measured as
single major peak on SEC) when stored for 8 weeks at 40'C versus when stored for 8 weeks at
4'C. In contrast to the no-LPV control, there were no differences in % purity observed in the
lipid containing Test Article (LPV-1) stored for 8 weeks at either 4'C or 40'C.
[01361                     Figure 4 shows the BT-474 anti-proliferation biological potency assay results of
the Test Article LPV- 1 (trastuzumab formulated with DPPG containing vesicles) versus the no
LPV control test article (unformulated trastuzumab) for the evaluation of effect on
thermostability at 8 weeks of storage at 40'C versus 4'C. The no-LPV reference control showed
a loss in potency (as measured by UV detection) when stored for 8 weeks at 40'C versus when
stored for 8 weeks at 4 0 C. In contrast to the no-LPV control, there were no differences in %
purity observed in the lipid containing Test Article (LPV-1) stored for 8 weeks at either 4 0 C or

formulated with DPPG containing vesicles or admixed to pre-formed Anionic surfactant vesicles.
