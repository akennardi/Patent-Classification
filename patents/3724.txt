Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments
[0031]      FIG. 1 illustrates a package 100 including a bottle 110, and a closure or stopper 112
and an aerator 114 disposed in the bottle 110. The package may be used to contain and
dispense wine, liquor, beer, or any other suitable beverage B. As will be discussed below in
detail, the package 100 is also configured to aerate the beverage B as it flows by gravity
through the bottle B before being dispensed from the bottle 110. Accordingly, no devices, tools,
or the like external to the bottle 110 are necessary to aerate the beverage B. The aerator 114
may be used, for example, to agitate the beverage for mixing with air and/or to release gas from
the beverage to aerate wine, form a head in beer, or for any other suitable purpose.
[0032]      The bottle may include a base 116 at a closed end 118, a sidewall 120 extending
from the base 116 along a longitudinal axis A of the package 100, a shoulder 122 extending
from the sidewall in a direction along the axis A, a neck 124 extending from the shoulder 122 in
a direction along the axis A. The neck 124 includes an interior 126, an interior surface 128, and
a mouth 130 at an open end 132 and having an end surface 134. The base 116 may be flat, or
may include a punt or push-up (not shown), or may be shaped in any other suitable
configuration. The sidewall 120 may be cylindrical, flat-sided, or shaped in any other suitable
configuration. The shoulder 122 may be excurvate or rounded, angled, or shaped in any other
suitable configuration. The neck 124 may include a frusto-conical portion 124a and a cylindrical
portion 124b, as shown, or may be cylindrical, or may be shaped in any other suitable
configuration. Also, the neck 124 may include a neck finish 136, which may include a retention
feature 138 for cooperation with a cap, cover, or the like (not shown). As shown, the bottle 110
is preferably composed of glass, but may be composed of any other suitable material(s) and
according to any suitable construction.
[0033]      The stopper 112 may include an article disposed within the neck of the bottle, as
shown, or may include a cap (not shown) that may be carried by the neck finish 136, for
example, by threads, crimp, clasp, or in any suitable retention arrangement. The stopper 112
may include a "cork" that may be composed of cork or any other suitable natural material, or of
polymeric material or any other suitable synthetic material. The stopper 112 may be press-fit or
interference-fit into the mouth 130 of the bottle neck 124.
[0034]      Referring now to FIG. 1A, the aerator 114 is separate from the bottle 110, extends
across the interior 126 of the bottle neck 124. For example, the aerator 114 may extend
laterally across the axis A, for instance, from wall-to-wall of the bottle neck 124. Also, the
aerator 114 is disposed entirely within the interior 126 of the neck 124 and does not extend out

                                                 -6
of the bottle neck 124. The aerator 114 includes an inlet end140, an outlet end 142 axially
spaced from the inlet end 140 in an upstream direction, an annular collar or outer wall 144 in
contact with the interior surface 128 of the bottle neck 124, a baffle 146 disposed radially
inwardly of the outer wall 144 and axially between the inlet and outlet ends 140, 142. The terms
"upstream" and "downstream" are used in context with dispensing of beverage out of the bottle,
wherein the beverage flows downstream in a direction from the closed end 118 toward the open
end 132.
[0035]     The baffle 146 may restrict, redirect, distribute, agitate, or aerate the beverage B in
any other suitable manner so that air is mixed with the beverage B. The baffle 146 may include
a conduit 148 that is disposed radially inwardly of the outer wall 144 and that extends in a
direction along the axis A, and a wall 150 that extends transversely between the conduit 148
and the outer wall 144 and that includes one or more apertures 152 that may be used for
venting air into the bottle 110 when dispensing the beverage B out of the bottle B. The
transverse wall 150 may extend from an upstream end of the outer wall 144 in a radially inward
and downstream direction. Accordingly, the upstream end of the outer wall 144 may be integral
with the transverse wall 150, and a downstream end of the outer wall 144 may be a free end.
At the upstream end 140 of the aerator 114, the aerator 114 may include a frusto-conical
circumferential surface 154 spaced from the interior surface 128 of the bottle 110. The
transverse wall 150 may be frusto-conical and may extend from an upstream end of the outer
wall 144 in a radially inward and downstream direction. In turn, the conduit 148 may extend
from a downstream end of the transverse wall 150 in a direction along the axis A. The conduit
148 may be cylindrical as shown but may also be funnel-shaped, inverse-funnel-shaped, frusto
conically-shaped, or of any other suitable shape. The conduit 148 may terminate at a
downstream end that may be disposed downstream of a downstream end of the outer wall 144.
 In this embodiment, the transverse wall 150 and/or the conduit 148 may have a wall thickness
that is less than the wall thickness of the outer wall 144. As used herein, the term transverse
means disposed at some angle with respect to the longitudinal axis A of the package 100 and
along any direction intersecting the package 100, and may include but is not limited to a radial
direction.
[0036]     As shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, the transversely extending wall may include a plurality
of the apertures 152 disposed radially outward of the conduit 148 and radially inward of the
outer wall 144. The apertures 152 may be arranged in an array 156 of circumferentially spaced
apertures 152. As best shown in FIG. 1A, the transverse wall 150 may be a frusto-conical
funnel with a larger diameter proximate the upstream end 140 of the aerator 114 and a smaller
diameter axially spaced from the upstream end 142 of the aerator 114.

                                                -7
[0037]      The conduit 148 may include a tubular passage 158 that may extend from a radially
inward end or portion of the transverse wall 150. In this embodiment, the inner diameter of the
tubular passage 158 may be 30-40% of the inner diameter of the bottle neck 124 where the
tubular passage 158 and the neck 124 overlap in an axial direction. The conduit 148 may
terminate in an aerating head 160 at the downstream end 142 of the aerator 114 that may be
larger than the tubular passage 158 of the conduit 148. The aerating head 160 may function
like a shower head to distribute the beverage B. The baffle 146 also may include a plate or disc
162 separate from the conduit 148 and that may be coupled to the aerator conduit 148 at the
downstream end of the aerator conduit 148, for example, at the aerating head 160. The
downstream end of the aerator conduit 148 may include apertures 164 extending radially
therethrough and the disc 162 may extend transversely across the aerator conduit 148 and
bisect or intersect the aerator conduit apertures 164. For example, the aerating head 160 may
establish a circular base wherein the openings 164 have slots in an axial end thereof with the
disc 162 snap fit into an annular groove 166 in the aerating head 160. Although shown as a
two-piece assembly, it is also contemplated that the aerator 114 could be molded from a single
component with the apertures 164 produced in any suitable manner after molding.
[0038]      In this embodiment, the aerator 114 is retained within the bottle neck 124 by frictional
fit between the aerator outer wall 144 and the bottle neck interior surface 128. For example, the
aerator outer wall 144 may be composed of a material with a coefficient of friction suitable to
resist slippage between the aerator 114 and the bottle neck interior surface 128. In another
example, the aerator outer wall 144 may be constructed with point-contact projections, or any
other suitable features to resist slippage between the aerator 114 and the bottle neck interior
surface 128. In a further example, the aerator outer wall 144 may be sized with respect to the
bottle neck interior surface 128 in such a manner resist slippage between the aerator 114 and
the bottle neck 124.
[0039]      In production of the package 100, the beverage B may be introduced into the bottle
110, and then the aerator 114 may be inserted through the open end 132 into the bottle neck
124 to a predetermined depth into the bottle neck 124 and held by friction to the bottle 110.
Thereafter, the stopper 112 may be inserted through the open end 132 into the bottle neck 124
to any suitable depth therein.
[0040]      In use, the stopper 112 may be removed in any suitable manner, and the bottle 110
may be tipped to a suitable angle at which the beverage B not only flows in a downstream
direction but also becomes aerated as it flows through the aerator 114 on its way to and out of
the bottle open end 132. In particular, the beverage B may flow from the bottle neck 124 and

                                                 -8
change direction to travel along the transverse wall 150, change direction again and flow
through the conduit 148, impact the disc 162 and change direction again, and flow out of the
apertures 164 and change direction again to flow toward and along the interior surface of the
bottle neck 124, and eventually be dispensed out of the open end 132.         Accordingly, the flow of
the beverage B changes direction, impacts various aerator surfaces, and impacts the bottle
neck interior surface 128, all of which contributes to aeration of the beverage. While the
beverage is being aerated and dispensed, air from outside of the bottle 110 may flow into the
bottle neck 124 and through one or more of the vent apertures 152 in the transverse wall 150 of
the aerator 114. Therefore, the beverage may flow in a direction away from the closed end 118
from a location upstream of the aerator 114, along the interior surface 128 of the bottle 110, and
may be directed or constricted by the aerator 114 to flow radially inwardly away from the bottle
interior surface 128 and through the aerator 114 in a direction toward the bottle open end 132,
and may be expanded away from the aerator 114 to flow back toward the interior surface 128 of
the bottle neck 124. Accordingly, the beverage B may be aerated not only specifically by the
aerator head 160, but also may be aerated by the constriction and expansion of the rest of the
geometry of the aerator 114, as well as by flow along the interior surfaces of the bottle neck
124, and/or the like.
[0041]      FIGS. 2A through 8B illustrate many other illustrative embodiments of aerators.
These embodiments are similar in many respects to the embodiment of FIGS. 1-1B and like
numerals between the embodiments generally designate like or corresponding elements
throughout the several views of the drawing figures. Accordingly, the descriptions of the
embodiments are incorporated into one another. Additionally, the description of the common
subject matter generally may not be repeated.
[0042]      FIG. 2A illustrates a package 200 that is substantially similar to that shown in FIG. 1A,
with some exceptions. The package 200 includes a bottle 210 that may include a neck 224 that
may include a frusto-conical portion 224a that may at least partially carry an aerator 214 and a
cylindrical portion 224b carrying the stopper 112. Also, the bottle 210 may include an aerator
retention feature 268 integral with an interior surface 228 of the bottle neck 224. In this
embodiment, the aerator retention feature 268 includes an annular depression in the interior
surface 228 of the bottle neck 224, and the aerator 214 includes a bottle engagement feature
270 that may include an annular projection extending radially outwardly from an outer wall 244
of the aerator 214 for cooperation with the retention feature 268 of the bottle 210 to retain the
aerator 214 within the bottle neck 224.

                                                 -9
[0043]      As also shown in FIG. 2B, the aerator 214 includes a plurality of vent apertures 252.
More specifically, the aerator 214 may include one or more radially outer vent apertures 252a,
and one or more radially inner vent apertures 252b disposed radially inwardly of the outer vent
apertures. For example, the apertures 252 may include a radially outer array of apertures, and a
radially inner array of apertures. The apertures 252 of each array may be circumferentially
spaced, and may be spaced in such a manner so as to be radially aligned. As used herein, the
term "annular" may include circumferentially extending, and may include circumferentially
continuous or circumferentially interrupted structure.
[0044]      Referring to FIG. 2A, the aerator also may include a stopper coupling feature 272 that
may facilitate insertion of both the stopper 112 and the aerator 214 in one manufacturing
operation. For example, in this embodiment, the stopper coupling feature 272 may project from
an aeration disc 262 in an axial direction downstream of the downstream end 242 of the aerator
214. The stopper coupling feature 272 may include one or more bayonets 274 as shown.
[0045]      In production of the package 200, the beverage B may be introduced into the bottle
210, and then the aerator 214 may be inserted through the open end 232 into the bottle neck
224 until the retention and engagement features 268, 270 engage. Such engagement may be
evidenced by tactile and/or audible feedback by the aerator 214 snapping against the bottle
210.
[0046]      FIG. 3A illustrates a package 300 that is substantially similar to that shown in FIG. 2A,
with some exceptions. In this embodiment, a bottle 310 includes aerator retention feature 368
that may include an annular projection extending radially inwardly from a bottle neck interior
surface 328, and the aerator 314 includes a bottle engagement feature 370 that may include an
annular shoulder at a downstream end of an outer wall 344 for cooperation with the retention
feature 368 of the bottle 310 to retain the aerator 314 within the bottle neck 324. Also, the
aerator 314 may include a longitudinally extending opening 376 through the outer wall 344
and/or a conduit 348 to circumferentially interrupt the outer wall 344 and/or the conduit 348.
Such an interruption may provide additionally resiliency of the aerator 314 to facilitate insertion
and retention thereof in the bottle 310. Additionally, in this embodiment, the inner diameter of a
tubular passage 358 may be less than 30% of the inner diameter of the bottle neck 324 where
the tubular passage 358 and the neck 324 axially overlap.
[0047]      In production of the package 300, the beverage B may be introduced into the bottle
310, and then the aerator 314 may be inserted through an open end 332 into the bottle neck
324. The longitudinal opening 376 facilitates radial and/or circumferential compression of the

                                               - 10
aerator 314, wherein the opening 376 at least partially closes when the aerator 314 is pressed
into the bottle neck 324. When the aerator shoulder 370 travels just beyond the retention
feature 368, where after the aerator 314 can expand into engagement with the interior surface
328 of the bottle neck 324 as a function of the resiliency of the outer wall 344 and the opening
376. Such engagement may be evidenced by tactile and/or audible feedback by the aerator
outer wall 344 snapping against the bottle 310.
[0048]     Referring now to FIG. 4A, a package 400 may include the bottle 310 from FIG. 3A,
and the stopper 112 and an aerator 414 disposed in the bottle 310. In this embodiment, the
aerator 414 may be a unitary component that does not require assembly of multiple parts and
that may be formed, machined, or otherwise produced as a single product. The aerator 414
includes a hub 457 that is connected to an outer wall 444 by a baffle 446 including a plurality of
vanes 478 that may be circumferentially spaced, for example, equidistantly from one another.
The circumferential spacing of the vanes 478 may be such that circumferential spaces 480 are
established between the vanes 478 with no circumferential overlap of the vanes 478. The
vanes 478 may form a turbine shape to force beverage flow to change direction and, more
specifically, one or more of the vanes 478 may be sail-shaped, for example, having radially
extending sides 482 and incurvate-shaped or incurvately extending sides 484. The outer wall
444 may include an annular shoulder 470 for engaging the annular retention feature 368 of the
bottle 310, and the vanes 478 may include radially outer portions 486 at the outer wall 444, and
the vanes 478 may extend in a direction axially downstream of the shoulder 470 and radially
inward and may terminate at the hub 457 for example at radially inner portions 488 of the vanes
478. A stopper coupling feature 472 may project from the hub 457 in an axial direction
downstream of a downstream end 442 of the aerator 414. The stopper coupling feature 472
may include one or more bayonets 474 as shown.
[0049]     In use, a portion of the beverage may flow along a radially inward surface of the outer
wall 444 and a larger portion of the beverage may flow along faces of the vanes 478 in an axial
and radially inward direction, and through the spaces 480 between the vanes 478. Thereafter,
the beverage may exit the aerator 414 at the downstream end 442 thereof and flow radially
outwardly toward and along the interior surface 328 of the bottle neck 324, before being
dispensed out of the open end 332. Therefore, the beverage may flow in a direction away from
the closed end of the bottle 310 from a location upstream of the aerator 314 along the interior
surface 328 of the bottle 310, may be directed or constricted by the aerator 314 to flow radially
inwardly away from the bottle interior surface 328 and along the aerator 314 in a direction
toward the open end 332, and may expand away from the aerator 314 to flow toward the interior
surface 328 of the bottle neck 324.

[0050]     With reference to FIG. 5A, a package 500 may include the bottle 310, and the stopper
112 and an aerator 514 disposed in the bottle 310. The aerator 514 may include an outer wall
544, and a radially outwardly facing frusto-conical circumferential surface 554 spaced from the
interior surface 328 of the bottle 310 at an upstream end 540 of the aerator 514, for the purpose
of leading the insertion of the aerator 514 into the bottle 310. The outer wall 544 may include
an annular shoulder 570 for engaging the annular retention feature 368 of the bottle 310, and a
circumferential extension 590 extending axially and radially inwardly from the outer wall 544 at
the shoulder 570.
[0051]     The aerator 514 includes a baffle 546 that extends across the outer wall 544. The
baffle 546 may include a funnel or radially inwardly facing frusto-conical circumferential surface
550 extending from the upstream end 540 toward a downstream end 542 of the aerator 514.
The baffle 546 also includes a plurality of vanes 578 that extend, for example radially, between
the wall 544 and a hub 557. The vanes 578 may include radially outer portions 586 at the outer
wall 544 and the extension 590, and radially inner portions 588 at the hub 557. The vanes 578
may be circumferentially spaced, for example, equidistantly from one another. The
circumferential spacing of the vanes 578 may be such that circumferential spaces 580 are
established between the vanes 578 with no circumferential overlap of the vanes 578. One or
more of the vanes 578 may be helically shaped, for example, like a propeller. The vanes 578
may have excurvate-shaped or excurvately extending sides 584. The hub 557 may be conically
or frusto-conically shaped with a smaller circumference at an upstream end and a larger
circumference at a downstream end thereof. A stopper coupling feature 572 may project from
the hub 557 in an axial direction downstream of the downstream end of the aerator 514.
[0052]      In use, a portion of the beverage may flow along a radially inward surface of the outer
wall 544 and a smaller portion of the beverage may flow along faces of the vanes 578 in an
axial and radially inward direction and along the hub 557, which may redirect flow of the
beverage in a radially outward direction. Thereafter, the beverage may exit the aerator 514 at
the downstream end 542 thereof and flow radially outwardly toward and along the interior
surface 328 of the bottle neck 324, before being dispensed out of the open end 332. Therefore,
the beverage may flow in a direction away from the closed end of the bottle 310 from a location
upstream of the aerator 514 along the interior surface 328 of the bottle 310, may be directed or
constricted by the aerator 514 to flow radially inwardly away from the bottle interior surface 328
and through the aerator 514 in a direction toward the open end 332, and may expand away from
the aerator 514 to flow toward the interior surface 328 of the bottle neck 324.

[0053]      Referring to FIG. 6A, a package 600 may include the bottle 310, and the stopper 112
and an aerator 614 carried in the bottle 310. The aerator 614 includes an outer wall 644 having
an upstream end and a downstream end, and a baffle 646 that may include a frusto-conical wall
648 extending in a radially inward and axially upstream direction from the outer wall 644 and
including a central aperture 658 and a plurality of other apertures 664 disposed radially
outwardly of the central aperture 658. The other apertures 664 may be arranged in one or more
arrays 664a, 664b of circumferentially spaced apertures 664, for example, a radially inner array
664b and a radially outer array 664a. The aerator 614 also may include one or more stopper
coupling features 672, for example, spikes that may extend from the downstream end of the
outer wall in a downstream direction.
[0054]      In use, a portion of the beverage flows along a radially inward surface of the outer
wall 344 and may flow through the baffle apertures 664 which direct flow in a radially inward
direction, and another portion may flow through the central aperture 658. Thereafter, the
beverage may exit the aerator 614 at a downstream end 642 thereof and flow radially outwardly
toward and along the interior surface 328 of the bottle neck 324, before being dispensed out of
the open end 332. Therefore, the beverage may flow in a direction away from the closed end of
the bottle 310 from a location upstream of the aerator 614 along the interior surface 328 of the
bottle 310, may be directed or constricted by the aerator 614 to flow radially inwardly away from
the bottle interior surface 328 and through the aerator 614 in a direction toward the open end
332, and may expand away from the aerator 614 to flow toward the interior surface 328 of the
bottle neck 324.
[0055]      Referring to FIG. 7A, a package 700 may include the bottle 310, and the stopper 112
and an aerator 714 carried in the bottle 310. The aerator 714 may be of multiple-piece
construction. For example, the aerator 714 may include an upstream portion 714a and a
downstream portion 714b coupled to the upstream portion 714a. The portions 714a, 714b may
be coupled at corresponding axial end portions of an outer wall 744 thereof by integral
fastening, melting or welding, or in any other suitable manner. The aerator 714 includes a
baffle 746, which includes a plurality of transverse walls 750a, 750b, 750c, 750d extending
radially inwardly from an outer wall 744 across the interior of the bottle neck 324. The
transverse walls 750a, 750b, 750c, 750d may include an upstream wall 750a that may be
integral with the upstream portion 714a, a downstream wall 750b that may be integral with the
downstream portion 714b, an intermediate upstream wall 750c that may be separately coupled
to the upstream portion 714a in a location downstream of the upstream wall 750a, and an
intermediate downstream wall 750d that may be separately coupled to the downstream portion
714b in a location downstream of the intermediate upstream wall 750c and upstream of the

                                                 - 13
downstream wall 750b. The separate walls 750c, 750d may be snap-fit into corresponding
annular reliefs of the respective portions 714a, 714b. The walls 750a, 750b, 750c, 750d may
include pluralities of apertures 752a, 752b, 752c, 752d. At least one of the walls 750a, 750b,
750c, 750d includes a plurality of apertures that are transversely misaligned with respect to
another plurality of apertures of at least one other of the walls 750a, 750b, 750c, 750d. For
example, apertures 752c of the intermediate upstream wall 750c may be misaligned with one or
both of the apertures 752a, 752d of the upstream and intermediate downstream walls 750a,
750d. Likewise, the apertures 752d of the intermediate downstream wall 750d may be
misaligned with the apertures 752b of the downstream wall 750b. Also, the walls 750a, 750b,
750c, 750d need not include the same quantities and sizes of apertures. The apertures in the
intermediate walls may be smaller and more numerous than the apertures in the upstream and
downstream walls, to facilitate flow of the beverage in conjunction with an opposite flow of air
into the container, thereby facilitating aeration of the beverage. The aerator 714 also may
include a circumferential ledge 790 extending radially inwardly from the outer wall 744 at the
downstream end 742 of the aerator 714. One or more stopper coupling features 772, for
example, spikes may extend from the downstream end of the outer wall 744 in a downstream
direction.
[0056]      In use, the beverage may flow into the open upstream end of the aerator 714, contact
the upstream wall 750a of the baffle 746 and change direction and flow through the apertures
752a therein, contact the intermediate upstream wall 750c and change direction and flow
through apertures 752c therein, contact the intermediate downstream wall 750d and change
direction and flow through the apertures 752d therein, and contact the downstream wall 750b
and change direction and flow through the apertures 752b therein and flow out of the open
downstream end of the aerator 714. Therefore, the beverage may flow in a direction away from
the closed end of the bottle 310 from a location upstream of the aerator 714 along the interior
surface 328 of the bottle 310, may be directed or constricted by the aerator 714 to flow in a
circuitous path away from the bottle interior surface 328 and along the aerator 714 in a direction
toward the open end 332, and may expand away from the aerator 714 to flow toward the interior
surface 328 of the bottle neck 324.
[0057]      Referring to FIG. 8A, a package 800 may include the bottle 310, and the stopper 112
and an aerator 814 carried in the bottle 310. The aerator 814 may be of unitary or single-piece
construction. The aerator 814 includes an outer wall 844 in contact with the interior surface 328
of the bottle neck 310. The aerator 814 also includes a baffle 846 that may include a first funnel
or frusto-conical wall 850 that extends from an upstream end of the outer wall 844 and in a
radially inward and axially downstream direction. The baffle 846 also may include a second

                                               - 14
funnel or frusto-conical wall 890 that extends from a downstream end of the outer wall 844 and
in a radially inward and axially downstream direction. The baffle 846 additionally includes
spokes 878 extending radially inwardly from the outer wall 844, and a hub 857 connected to the
outer wall 844 by the spokes 878. The circumferential spacing of the spokes 878 may be such
that circumferential spaces 880 are established between the spokes 878 with no circumferential
overlap of the spokes 878. The hub 857 may be frusto-conical with a smaller diameter at an
upstream end and a larger diameter at a downstream end. The baffle 846 also may include
projections 892 extending at a non-zero angle with respect to a plane established by the spokes
and/or at a non-zero angle with respect to the longitudinal axis A of the package 800. One or
more stopper coupling features 872, for example, spikes may extend from the downstream end
of the hub 857 in a downstream direction.
[0058]      In use, the beverage may flow into the open upstream end of the aerator 814, contact
the first funnel 850, the hub 857, projections 892, and spokes 878, flow through the spaces 880
between the spokes 878 and flow over the second funnel 890 out of the open downstream end
of the aerator 814. The first funnel 850 may direct the beverage flow radially inward, the hub
857 and/or projections 892 may direct the beverage flow radially outward, and the second
funnel 890 may direct the beverage flow radially inward. Therefore, the beverage may flow in a
direction away from the closed end of the bottle 810 from a location upstream of the aerator 814
along the interior surface 328 of the bottle 310, may be directed or constricted by the aerator
814 to flow in radially inward and outward directions away from and toward the bottle interior
surface 328 and along the aerator 814 in a direction toward the open end 332, and may be
expanded away from the aerator 814 to flow toward the interior surface 328 of the bottle neck
324.
[0059]      According to another embodiment, a method of producing a beverage package
includes forming a bottle and inserting an aerator into the bottle.
[0060]      The bottle may be formed in any suitable manner. The bottle includes a base, a
sidewall extending from the base, a shoulder extending from the sidewall, and a neck extending
from the shoulder and including an open end having an end surface, an interior, and an interior
surface.
[0061]      In one example, the glass bottle can be fabricated in a press-and-blow manufacturing
operation, wherein a molten glass charge or gob is placed in a blank mold and a plunger is
moved into the blank mold to form the molten glass gob against the inside surfaces of the blank
mold. The glass preform or parison is then removed from the blank mold and placed in a blow

                                                  - 15
mold, in which the parison body and a major portion of the neck are stretched by blow gas
(usually air) against the internal surfaces of the blow mold while the neck finish remains in the
geometry formed in the blank mold.
[0062]     In another example, the glass bottle can be formed in a blow-and-blow manufacturing
operation, wherein a gob of glass is loaded into an inverted parison mold having neck rings at
its bottom end, a baffle is applied to the open top end of the parison mold, and a settle blowing
pressure is applied to the gob of glass to force the molten glass into the cavity defined by the
neck rings. Subsequently, a counter blow pressure is applied through the bore of the neck rings
to blow the gob of glass into intimate engagement with the walls of the parison mold and form a
parison having a hollow interior. The baffle is then removed, the parison mold opened, and the
inverted parison is transferred to an upright position by the neck rings where it is enclosed
within the blow mold by closing two blow mold halves thereon.
[0063]     The aerator may be inserted into the bottle so that the aerator is disposed entirely
within the interior of the bottle neck and spaced axially from the end surface of the bottle neck.
The aerator may be coupled to a stopper wherein the stopper and the aerator are inserted into
the bottle together. The aerator may include an aerator and/or a funnel or pour spout.
[0064]     There thus has been disclosed a package and a related method that fully satisfy all of
the objects and aims previously set forth. The disclosure has been presented in conjunction
with several illustrative embodiments, and additional modifications and variations have been
discussed. Other modifications and variations readily will suggest themselves to persons of
ordinary skill in the art in view of the foregoing discussion.
[0065]     This application is a divisional application of Australian patent application number
<removed-apn> which is a divisional application of Australian patent application number
2013267901, whose specifications as originally filed are hereby incorporated by reference in
entirety.
