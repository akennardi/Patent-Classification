                     CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] The present application is a divisional application from Australian patent application
number 2013312135, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by way of this
reference.
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]    A tumor cell exists in part because it has selected for one or more mutations that
allows it to partially or completely escape immune surveillance in vivo.
[0003]    In an attempt to elicit an immune response to a tumor cell, previous researchers have
used dendritic cells, which are professional antigen-presenting cells, to present tumor
antigens to the immune system. For example, dendritic cells pulsed with peptide or tumor
lysate have been used to vaccinate melanoma patients.
[0004]    However, simply presenting tumor antigens to the immune system in the foregoing
manner has not been effective because such antigens were merely endocytosed by the
dendritic cells and generally presented through the Major Histocompatibility Complex
(MHC) class II, which elicits only helper T cells and does not provide a robust immune
response.
[0005]    In contrast, presenting tumor antigens via the MHC class I pathway contributes to a
more robust anti-tumor immunity by activating CD8+ T cells. Previous researchers have
attempted to present tumor antigens through the MHC class I pathway by using gene transfer
methods. However, these methods have disadvantages, including (1) a limited ability to
identify all of the important tumor-specific antigens, (2) a limited ability to map the genes of
specific tumor antigens, (3) only one or a small number of known tumor antigen genes can be
introduced into a dendritic cell and (4) the methods are time-consuming and cumbersome.
                                                -1-

                               SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006]     Some embodiments relate to an isolated dendritic cell comprising a phagocytosed
component consisting essentially of (i) a particle and (ii) a tumor lysate loaded within the
particle. In specific embodiments, the tumor lysate is present in an amount from about 200
pg to about 500 pg. In specific embodiments, the tumor lysate is present in an amount of
about 200 pg.
[0007]    In some embodiments, the tumor lysate is a lysate selected from a cancer selected
from the group consisting of breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer,
glioma, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma,
liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer and ocular melanoma.
[0008]    In some embodiments, the particle is a yeast cell wall particle. In some
embodiments, the dendritic cell is an immature cell that has been isolated for no more than 8
days.
[0009]    Another embodiment relates to a vaccine comprising the foregoing isolated dendritic
cell.
[0010]     Some embodiments relate to a method for producing an isolated dendritic cell
containing a tumor lysate loaded particle comprising: (i) loading the tumor lysate into the
particle to produce the tumor lysate loaded particle; (ii) freeze-drying the tumor lysate loaded
particle; and (iii) incubating the tumor lysate loaded particle with a dendritic cell, wherein the
incubating causes the dendritic cell to phagocytose the tumor lysate loaded particle.
[0011]    In specific embodiments, the foregoing method further comprises (a) resuspending
the tumor lysate loaded particle in solution and (b) freeze-drying the resuspended solution
before step (iii). In specific embodiments, the tumor lysate is produced by freezing and
thawing the tumor. In specific embodiments, the foregoing method further comprises
repeating the freezing and thawing steps. In specific embodiments, the foregoing method
further comprises cryopreserving the tumor lysate at -150 C.
                                                -2-

[0012]    In specific embodiments, step (iii) comprises: (a) adding tumor lysate into a yeast
cell wall particle, (b) incubating the yeast cell wall particle, (c) freeze-drying the yeast cell
wall particle and (d) washing the yeast cell wall, wherein steps (b)-(c) are repeated at least
once with a step of adding water into the yeast cell particle before step (b) is repeated.
[0013]    In specific embodiments, step (iii) comprises: (a) contacting the tumor lysate loaded
particle and the dendritic cell at a ratio of about 100:1, (b) incubating the tumor lysate loaded
particle with the dendritic cell for 1 to 2 hours and (c) collecting the dendritic cell and
washing the cell.
[0014]    In a preferred embodiment, a small amount of one or more immune response
enhancing adjuvants is added to the tumor lysis buffer prior to incubating with a dendritic
cell. The addition of one or more adjuvants increases the effects of the tumor lysate on the
dendritic cell while dramatically decreasing any systemic effects from such adjuvants.
Commonly used adjuvants include but are not limited to proteins, peptides, nucleic acids and
carbohydrates.
[0015]    Exemplary adjuvants include but are not limited to monophosphoryl lipid A, GpC
ologonucleotides (such as GpC DNA), Poly I:C, Poly ICLC, potent MHC II epitope peptides,
beta glucan, and dendritic cell stimulating cytokines such as IL-12. Suitable adjuvants are
those molecules known to interact with receptors on dendritic cells in order to activate
dendritic cells and further stimulate a more robust generation of T cells, such as CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells.
[0016]    In one embodiment, the amount of one or more immune response enhancing
adjuvants is at least about 5 pg, at least about 10 pg, at least about 15 pg, at least about 20
pg, at least about 25 pg, at least about 30 pg, at least about 35 pg, at least about 40 pg, at
least about 45 pg, at least about 50 pg, at least about 60 pg, at least about 70 pg, at least
about 80 pg, at least about 80 pg, at least about 90 pg, or at least about 100 pg. In one
                                                              1
embodiment, the amount of adjuvant represents between           -10% of the total lysate amount.
The amount of adjuvant is sufficient to stimulate receptors, such as the toll-like receptor, on
the dendritic cell.
                                                 -3-

[0017]     Some embodiments relate to a method for treating cancer, comprising administering
a vaccine comprising the foregoing isolated dendritic cell. In specific embodiments, the
cancer is selected from the group consisting of breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, non
small cell lung cancer, glioma, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms tumors,
rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, prostate
cancer and ocular melanoma.

therapeutically effective amounts and therapeutic levels are provided below with reference to
adult human subject. Those skilled in the art can adjust such amounts in accordance with
standard practices as needed to treat a specific subject and/or condition/disease.
[0030]    Tumor Lysate
[0031]    As described herein, "tumor lysate" refers to a tumor that has been lysed. Tumor
lysis can occur under a number of conditions, including repeated freezing and thawing of the
tumor, physical breakage of the tumor by homogenizing, contact with a hyper- or hypo-tonic
solution and contact with one or more non-ionic detergents. The tumor lysate is not cross
linked during the lysing process. In another embodiment, the tumor lysate is produced by
mincing, grinding or mashing the tumor, or otherwise pulverizing the tumor using any known
technique in the art. In another embodiment, the tumor lysate is produced by mincing,
grinding, mashing or pulverizing the tumor in the presence of phosphate buffer solution
(PBS), such as IX PBS.
                                                -5-

[0032]    In specific embodiments, the tumor lysate is produced from a solid tumor weighing
a minimum of 200 to 500 pg.
[0033]    In another embodiment, the tumor lysate is produced by mincing, grinding, mashing
or pulverizing the tumor followed by repeated freezing and thawing. In specific
embodiments, the minced tumor is frozen and thawed multiple times. In specific
embodiments, the minced tumor is frozen and thawed at least 1, 2, 3 or 4 times. In some
embodiments, the freezing is performed in liquid nitrogen, and can be performed for 20
minutes. In specific embodiments, the thawing is performed at room temperature. In another
embodiment, the tumor lysate is stored at a temperature of about -135 C or below after the
freezing and thawing process. In specific embodiments, the tumor lysate is store at a
temperature of -150 C or below after the freezing and thawing process.
[0034]    The tumor lysate can be prepared from any solid tumor including, but not limited to
carcinomas, and sarcomas. In some embodiments, the solid tumors are from tumors relating
to breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, glioma, medulloblastoma,
neuroblastoma, Wilms tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, liver cancer, pancreatic
cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer and ocular melanoma.
[0035]    A number of immune response enhancing agents can be added to the tumor lysis
buffer as adjuvants to boost immune response such that when the tumor lysate is incubated
with a dendritic cell, the adjuvants exhibit an increased effect on the dendritic cell while
dramatically decreasing any systemic effects from such adjuvants.
[0036]    It is within the purview of one of ordinary skill in the art to select one or more
suitable adjuvants for this invention. For instance, monophosphoryl lipid A, GpC
oligonucleotides, Poly I:C, Poly ICLC, potent MHC II epitope peptides, and dendritic cell
stimulating cytokines such as IL-12, IL-2, and GM-CSF are good adjuvant candidates of this
invention.
[0037]    Particle
[0038]    As described herein, "particle" refers to any hollow and porous structure that can
contain tumor lysate therein and also allow the lysate to exit the structure. In some
                                                -6-

embodiments, the size of the particle is about 0.5 to about 5 pim, which approximates the size
of bacterium to allow the particle to be ingested by monocytes, such as dendritic cells. In
specific embodiments, the size of the particle is about 0.5 to about 1 pim. In specific
embodiments, the size of the particle is about 0.5 to about 2.5 pim. In some embodiments, the
particle can be any particle with a glycan network, so long as the particle is about 0.5 to about
5 pm in size.
[0039]    In some embodiments, the particle is a bead vector. The bead vector is not limited
by shape or material, but can be any shape, size or material that allows the bead vector to be
phagocytosed by monocytes, including dendritic cells.
[0040]    In another embodiment, the particle is a yeast cell wall particle ("YCWP"). The
YCWP is prepared from yeast cell wall such that the particle is porous and can contain lysate
therein. In one embodiment, the YCWP is prepared from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In
another embodiment, the YCWP is a zymosan particle. In another embodiment, the YCWP
approximates the size of microbial structures that cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system
and other phagocytic cells typically ingests. In specific embodiments, the YCWP is about 1
5 pim.
[0041]    In one embodiment, the YCWP is prepared by (a) suspending yeast to produce a
suspension, (b) incubating the suspension, (c) centrifuging the suspension and removing the
supernatant and (d) recovering the resulting YCWP. In another embodiment, steps (a)-(d) are
repeated at least 1, 2, 3 or 4 times.
[0042]    In another embodiment, the YCWP is prepared by (a) suspending yeast in a solution
to produce a first suspension, (b) incubating the first suspension, (c) centrifuging the first
suspension and removing the supernatant, (d) suspending the resulting pellet to produce a
second suspension, (e) incubating the second suspension, (f) centrifuging the second
suspension and removing the supernatant and (g) washing the resulting pellet to recover the
YCWP. In another embodiment, the YCWP is sterilized.
[0043]    In specific embodiments, the yeast is suspended in NaOH, including IM NaOH. In
specific embodiments, the first suspension is incubated at about 80 C for about 1 hour or for
1 hour. In specific embodiments, the centrifuging is performed at about 2000 times gravity
                                               -7-

for about 10 minutes, or at 2000 times gravity for 10 minutes. In specific embodiments, the
pellet is suspended in water, including water at about pH 4.5 or at pH 4.5. In specific
embodiments, the second suspension is incubated at about 55 C for about 1 hour or at 55 C
for 1 hour. In specific embodiments, the pellet is washed in water at least 1, 2, 3 or 4 times.
In specific embodiments, the pellet is washed once.
[0044]     In another embodiment, the YCWP is sterilized using isopropanol and/or acetone
following washing of the pellet. In specific embodiments, other known alcohols are
appropriate. In specific embodiments, the YCWP is allowed to fully dry after sterilization.
In another embodiment, the YCWP is resuspended after being allowed to dry. In specific
embodiments, the YCWP is resuspended in PBS, such as IX PBS. In another embodiment,
the YCWP is allowed to dry and then frozen before the tumor lysate is loaded into the
YCWP, in order to place it in storage before use. In specific embodiments, the YCWP is
freeze dried and store at about 4 C or lower. In specific embodiments, the YCWP is freeze
dried and store at 4 C.
[0045]     Tumor Lysate Loaded Particle
[0046]     The particle is loaded with tumor lysate. In one embodiment, the tumor lysate is
loaded into the particle by incubating the lysate and a suspension of particles together and
allowing the lysate to penetrate into the hollow insides of the particles.
[0047]     In another embodiment, after the particle is loaded with tumor lysate, the
combination is freeze-dried to create an anhydrous tumor lysate within the particle. By
freeze-drying the particle loaded with tumor lysate, the lysate is trapped within the particle
and ready to be phagocytosed by a monocyte, such as a dendritic cell. In specific
embodiments, the freeze-drying is the only mechanism used to trap the lysate within the
particle. In specific embodiments, the entrapment is not caused by a separate component
blocking the lysate from exiting the particle, for example, by physical entrapment,
hydrophobic binding, any other binding. In specific embodiments, the entrapment is not
caused by crosslinking or otherwise attaching the lysate to the particle outside of any
attachment that may occur upon freeze-drying.
                                                -8-

[0048]     In another embodiment, the particle is resuspended in solution after the freeze
drying. In specific embodiments, the solution is water. In specific embodiments, the particle
is resuspended to allow additional tumor lysate to penetrate the particle and then the
combination is freeze-dried again. In other embodiments, the combination is subjected to
multiple freeze-drying and resuspensions. In other embodiments, the tumor lysate loaded
particle is sterilized in ethanol after the freeze-drying and before use.
[0049]     In specific embodiments, the tumor lysate is loaded into the particle by (a)
incubating the lysate and a suspension of the particles, allowing the lysate to penetrate into
the hollow insides of the particles and freeze-drying the suspension of particles loaded with
lysate and (b) optionally resuspending the particles, incubating the resuspended particles and
freeze drying the resuspended particles and any tumor lysate not already in the particle.
[0050]     In specific embodiments using YCWPs, the number of YCWPs is about 1 x 109 and
the volume of tumor lysate is about 50 pL (generated from about 200 pg of tumor tissue). In
specific embodiments, the number of YCWPs is 1 x 109 and the volume of tumor lysate is 50
pL (from about 200 pg of tumor tissue). In specific embodiments, the incubation in step (a)
is for about 2 hours at about 4 C. In specific embodiments, the incubation in step (a) is for 2
hours at 4 C. In some embodiments, the foregoing suspension is freeze dried in step (b) over
a period of about 2 hours or over a period of 2 hours. In some embodiments, the YCWPs in
step (c) are resuspended in water, including about 50 pL of water or 50 pL of water. In some
embodiments, the resuspended YCWPs are incubated in step (d) for about 2 hours at about 4
 C or for 2 hours at 4 -C.
 [0051]     Dendritic Cell
[0052]     As described herein, "dendritic cell" refers to a cell generated from a peripheral
blood mononuclear cell ("PBMC"). In one embodiment, a dendritic cell is prepared by (a)
collecting blood, (b) diluting the blood, (c) performing a density gradient separation of
PBMCs, (d) lysing red blood cells and washing the PBMCs, (e) incubating the PBMCs, (f)
removing nonadherent cells and (g) culturing adherent cells in media.
                                                  -9-

[0053]    In some embodiments, the dendritic cell is an immature dendritic cell that has been
cultured for no more than 5 days. In other embodiments, the dendritic cell has been cultured
for 6-8 days.
[0054]    In specific embodiments, the blood is heparinized. In specific embodiments, the
density gradient separation at step (c) comprises placing the blood in a Lymphocyte
Separation Medium and then centrifuging the blood. In specific embodiments, the
centrifuging is performed at about 1000 times gravity for about 20 minutes or at 1000 times
gravity for 20 minutes. In specific embodiments, a second centrifuging is performed before
step (d) and is performed at about 500g for about 5 minutes or is performed at 500g for 5
minutes. In specific embodiments, a third centrifuging is performed before step (d) and is
performed at about 500g for about 10 minutes or is performed at 500g for 10 minutes. In
specific embodiments, the lysing is performed using an ACK lysing solution, followed by
incubation, preferably at room temperature for about 5 minutes, and followed by a
subsequent centrifugation. In specific embodiments, the PBMCs are washed in RPMI-1640
medium. In specific embodiments, the PBMCs are incubated at step (e) in flasks at about 37
 C for about 1-2 hours or at 37 C for 1-2 hours. In specific embodiments, serum-free DC
media is added to the flask.
[0055]    In some embodiments, one or more cytokines is present in the culture media,
including, but not limited to, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (800
units/ml) and IL-4 (500 units/ml).
[0056]    Tumor Lysate Loaded Particles Phagocytosed in Dendritic Cells
[0057]    The tumor lysate loaded particle is phagocytosed within a monocyte, preferably a
dendrite cell. In one embodiment, the tumor lysate loaded particle is incubated with a
dendritic cell such that the cell phagocytoses the tumor lysate loaded particle.
[0058]    In specific embodiments, the particle is incubated with the dendritic cell at a ratio of
about 100:1 or at a ratio of 100:1. The incubation can be performed for in about 1 hour, 1
hour or preferably less than 1 hour.
                                               -10-

[0059]     In specific embodiments, the incubated dendritic cell containing the tumor lysate
particle is collected and washed, for example, at least 1, 2, 3 or 4 times. In other
embodiments, the dendritic cells are incubated after washing and resuspended in freezing
medium. In specific embodiments, the resuspension produces a concentration of about 10 x
106 cells per ml or 10 x 106 cells per ml. In specific embodiments, the resuspension is frozen
for storage before use.
[0060]     Vaccine
[0061]     In one embodiment, the dendritic cell containing a tumor lysate loaded particle is
used as a vaccine to prevent and/or treat a disease, including cancer. The disease to be
treated is not particularly limiting, but depends on the particular tumor lysate loaded into the
particle. For example, a vaccine using tumor lysate from a breast cancer tumor is used to
treat breast cancer. In another embodiment, a patient's own tumor cells are used to create the
vaccine. For example, the vaccine can be produced using tumor lysate from a tumor
associated with breast cancer and then administered to the breast cancer patient from which
the tumor was extracted. In another embodiment, about 200 pL of a 10 x 106 concentration
of dendritic cells containing tumor lysate loaded particles forms one dose of the vaccine.
[0062]     In another embodiment, the dose is administered by diluting the 200 pL aliquot to a
final volume of 1 ml before administering the dose to a patient. In specific embodiments, the
aliquot is diluted with sterile saline containing 5% human serum albumin. In specific
embodiments, the 200 pL aliquot will need to be thawed before dilution. In such a scenario,
the length of time between thawing and administration of the dose to a patient will be no
longer than 2 hours. In some embodiments, the diluted aliquot is administered in a 3 cc
syringe. In some embodiments, a syringe needle no smaller than 23 gauge is used.
[0063]     In another embodiment, a patient is administered at least 1, 2, 3 or 4 doses. In
specific embodiments, a patient is re-vaccinated once every 4 weeks. In specific
embodiments, about 1-2 million dendritic cells containing tumor lysate loaded particles will
be administered at each vaccination. In another embodiment, the dendritic cells containing
tumor lysate loaded particles are administered to a patient by injection. In specific
                                                -11-

embodiments, the tumor lysate loaded particles are injected in a patient at or near (1) a tumor
or (2) a lymph node.
[0064]    In some embodiments, the vaccine is not administered with any other
immunosuppressive treatment, such as steroids or chemotherapy. The vaccine can be
administered using any technique, including intravenous injection and inhalation.
[0065]    The vaccine can also contain biological adjuvants, including but not limited to
nucleic acids such as GpC oligonucleotides, proteins or peptide epitopes such as the tetanus
toxoid MHC class II-binding p30 peptide.
 [0066]    EXAMPLE 1: Preparing Dendritic Cells
[0067]    Dendritic cells were generated from a patient's PBMCs. PBMCs were collected
from the patient by a blood draw of 200 ml following standard operating procedures. The
blood was then transferred to 250 ml centrifuge tubes and diluted 1:1 with 1X PBS. Then, 35
ml of the diluted blood was layered over 15 ml of room temperature Lymphocyte Separation
Medium (LSM; Mediatech) in 50 ml tubes and centrifuged at 1000g for 20 minutes at room
temperature. The PBMC layers were removed by pipetting from the LSM gradients and
placed into clean 50 ml centrifuge tubes. Four volumes of IX PBS were added and the tubes
were inverted to mix the contents. The PBMCs were then centrifuged at 500g at room
temperature for 5 minutes. Ten ml of IX PBS were added into each tube and the cells were
resuspended and pooled into 1 tube. The PBMCs were again centrifuged at 500g at room
temperature for 10 minutes, resuspended in 20 to 40 ml of ACK lysing solution (Cambrex)
and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. The cells were then centrifuged again at
1500 rpm for 5 minutes. The PBMCs were resuspended in 30 ml RPMI-1640 medium
(Mediatech). The cells were then transferred into 2-4 T75 flasks. The flasks were incubated
at 370 C for 1 to 2 hours. The non-adherent cells were then removed by rinsing. Afterwards,
10 ml of IX PBS were added into each flask, the flask swirled, and the PBS removed.
Afterwards, 10 ml of complete DC media (serum-free DC Medium + 800 U/ml GM-CSF +
1000 U/ml IL-4) was added to each flask. The flasks were then incubated at 37'C, 5% C02
for 2 days. On Day 3, 10 ml of complete DC medium was added into each flask. The cells
                                             -12-

were then incubated for another 2 days. On Day 6 or 7, the resulting immature DCs were
ready for use.

[0069]    EXAMPLE 2: Preparing Tumor Lysate
[0070]    A tumor sample was obtained from a patient. After separating fat and necrotic
tissue away from the tumor tissue, the tissue was weighed and IX PBS added (50 pL of PBS
per 200pg of tissue) and the tumor was minced thoroughly with scalpels in IX PBS. The
tumor cells were then subjected to 4 cycles of freeze and thaw. The freezing was performed
in liquid nitrogen for 20 minutes and the thawing was performed at room temperature.
Prepared tumor lysate was quantified by a spectrophotometer. An aliquot was taken for
quality control testing. The remainder was stored at < -135' C in preparation for vaccine
preparation. Small amounts of adjuvant can optionally be added after the freeze thaw cycles.

 [0072]    EXAMPLE 3: Preparing YCWP
[0073]    YCWPs were prepared from Fleishmans Baker's Yeast or equivalent. Briefly, 10 g
of Fleishmans Baker's yeast was suspended in 100 ml of 1 M NaOH and heated to 80 C for
one hour. The undissolved yeast cell walls were recovered by centrifugation at 2000 x g for
10 minutes. The recovered yeast cell walls were then resuspended in 100 ml of water with
the pH adjusted to 4.5 with HCl and incubated at 55 C for an additional hour, and
subsequently recovered by centrifugation. The recovered YCWPs were then washed with
water once, isopropanol 4 times and finally acetone 2 times. Once the YCWPs were fully
dried they were resuspended in PBS, counted, aliquoted into groups of 1 X10 9 particles and
freeze dried for use in manufacturing the vaccine.

[0075]    EXAMPLE 4: Preparing YCWP
                                              -13-

[0076]    Three grams of active dry yeast (Fleischmann's or equivalent) were washed three
times in water by suspending the yeast in 30 mL of sterile water, vortexing, and centrifuging
at 800-1000 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature. After decanting the supernatant, the yeast
pellet was resuspended in 50 mL of 1 M NaOH and heated in a 90 C water bath for 1 hour.
[0077]    The yeast suspension was subsequently centrifuged at 800-1000 x g for 5 minutes,
and the pellet was resuspended in 25-30 mL of acid water (pH adjusted to 4.5 with HCl). The
acid water wash step was repeated until the pH of the suspension is < 7.0. Then the pellet
was resuspended in 30 mL acid water and incubated in a 75 C water bath for 1 hour. The
yeast pellet was recovered by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 5 minutes, and then washed with
10 mL of sterile water 3 times, 10 mL of isopropanol 4 times and finally 10 mL of acetone 2
times. The acetone was carefully removed, and the pellet was spread evenly on the glass
surface of a beaker, allowed to air dry overnight.
[0078]    The dried YWCPs were collected and stored in a vacuum jar at 4 C and then
washed in 10-15 mL of filtered 70% ethanol 3 times. The YWCPs were briefly sonicated on
the final wash, and the sonication was repeated if necessary to disperse clumps. Once the
ethanol was removed, the YWCPs were washed in sterile water. Aliquots of 100 pl of
YWCPs were dispensed into 2.0 mL rounded bottom snap top centrifuge tubes, placed in
freezer for 1 hour, freeze dried, and stored in a vacuum jar at 4 C for future use.
[0079]    EXAMPLE 5: Loading Tumor Lysate into YCWP
[0080]    A suspension of fully anhydrous YCWPs (1 X 109) was placed in contact with 50
pL of tumor lysate in PBS (from 200 pgs of tumor tissue) over a period of 2 hours at 4 C,
allowing the lysate to penetrate into the hollow insides of the YCWPs to produce loaded
YCWPs. The suspension was then freeze dried for 2 hours. After freeze drying, 50 pL of
water was added to the loaded YCWPs, incubated for another 2 hours at 4 C and again
freeze dried to yield YCWPs with dry tumor lysate within their hollow insides. The loaded
YCWPs were then sterilized by washing in ethanol and maintained in ethanol.
[0081]    Figure 4 provides an overview of the YCWPs loading procedure.
[0082]    EXAMPLE 6: Loading YCWPs with Tumor Lysate
                                               -14-

[0083]    A patient tumor biopsy sample was mixed carefully with 50-100 pl of lysis buffer
(PBS) (depending on the amount of the tumor sample), avoiding bubbles during mixing, and
was then incubated at 4 C for 30 minutes. The mixture was subjected to freeze-thaw 3 times
in acetone-dry ice bath and 37 C water bath, and centrifuged at 4 C for 10 minutes at
maximum speed. 50 pl of the prepared tumor lysate was added in a sterile 2 mL centrifuge
tube containing 10 mg of dried YCWPs such that the liquid tumor lysate covered the
YCWPs. The mixture was incubated at 4 C for 2 hours until the liquid tumor lysate soaked
into the YCWPs.
[0084]    The tube was then placed into a -85 C freezer for 30 minutes for a quick freeze of
the pellet. The tube was placed on freeze drier overnight. 50 pl of sterile water was added
onto the dried yeast pellet and incubated at 4 C for 2 hours to allow the liquid to soak into
the pellets.
[0085]    The tube was placed into a -85 C freezer for 30 minutes for a quick freeze of the
pellet. The tube was then placed on freeze drier overnight. The dried particles were then
resuspended in 1 mL of 70% ethanol and stored at 4 C for future use.
[0086]    EXAMPLE 8: Preparing Dendritic Cells Containing Tumor Lysate Loaded Particles
[0087]    The tumor lysate loaded YCWPs in 70% ethanol suspension was centrifuged. The
ethanol was removed carefully and replaced with 1 mL of PBS. The loaded YCWPs were
sonicated. The loaded YCWPs were washed with sterile IX PBS. After final wash, the
loaded YCWPs were resuspended in PBS to approximately 1 X 108 particles/100 pl PBS.
[0088]    The loaded YCWPs were added to a dendritic cell culture at a ratio of 1:100, and the
culture was returned to 37 'C incubator. Subsequently, the following factors were added to
the culture: 50 pg/mL of TNF-a in sterile water was added to the culture at a ratio of 1:5000
in volume (2 pL per 10 mL of culture); 10 pg/mL of IL-1P in sterile water was added to the
culture at a ratio of 1:1000 in volume; 10 pg/mL of IL-6 in sterile water was added to the
culture at a ratio of 1:1000 in volume; and 1 mg/mL of PGE2 in 100% ethanol was added to
the culture at a ratio of 1:1000 in volume. After all factors were added and mixed into the
culture, the culture was incubated overnight.

[0089]   EXAMPLE 9: Harvest of Dendritic Cells, Preparation and Cryopresrvation of
Vaccine
[0090]   The dendritic cell culture prepared according to Example 9 was removed from the
incubator. The following procedure was performed in a hood under sterile conditions. 10
mL of media were removed from culture flask. The culture flask was rinsed with 4.0-4.5 mL
of IX PBS and also added to the media.
[0091]    1.5-2.0 mL of CellStripperTM was added to the culture flask. The culture flask was
placed in 37 'C incubator for 10-20 minutes. About 4 mL of the culture media were added
back to the flask from the tube to wash and remove cells. The flask was washed to harvest as
many cells as possible. The cells were counted on hemacytometer or Cellometer TM. The
supernatant was removed after centrifugation.
[0092]    Subsequently, the cells were resuspended in CryoStorTM 10 at 5 X 106 cells/mL,
aliquoted into cryovials properly labeled with patient ID Number, date and cell concentration
at 1.25 X 106 cells/mL per vial (about 250 pL). A 250-500 pL portion was saved in a
cryovial for sterility testing, and the remaining vials were stored in Styrofoam containers and
placed under -86 'C to step down freeze.
[0093]   EXAMPLE 10: Preparation of the Solid Tumor Vaccine for Patient Administration
[0094]   One cryovial of patient's cell was removed from cryostorage and carefully thawed at
37 'C in a water bath. Under sterile conditions, 1 mL of sterile saline for injection with 5%
human serum albumin (or 1 mL of sterile IX PBS) was gently added to the cryovial
containing the cells. After the cells were carefully resuspended, the entire volume from the
cryovial was drawn and the syringe containing the tumor cells was used for administration of
the vaccine to a patient.
[0095]   EXAMPLE 11: Dendritic Cells Containing Tumor Lysate Loaded Particles versus
antigen pulsed dendritic cells (DCs)
[0096]   B3Z cells are a T cell hybridoma expressing a T-cell receptor that specifically
recognizes the OVA( 25 7-2 6 4 ) (SIINFEKL) epitope in the context of H-2Kb and carry a beta
                                                -16-

galactosidase (lacZ) construct driven by a nuclear factor of activated T cells elements from
the interleukin 2 promoter (X). These B3Z cells were used to evaluate the effectiveness of
dendritic cells pulsed with ovalbumin versus those loaded with ovalbumin by way of
ovalbumin loaded YCWPs for antigen presentation, resulting in a CD8+ T cell response.
[0097]    Upon activation by interaction with MHC class I molecules on dendritic cells
presenting ovalbumin epitopes, the B3Z cells were engineered to respond by expressing        p
galactosidase. p-Galactosidase catalyzes a breakdown of X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl-p
D-galactopyranoside) to yield 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-hydroxyindole, a blue colored product.
Spectroscopic measurement of this blue color gives a measure of the effective MHC class I
presentation of the ovalbumin epitope. The results of this experiment, shown in Figure 6,
demonstrate that loading dendritic cells by ovalbumin loaded YCWPs gave more than a 100
fold increase in CD8+ T cell response over dendritic cells pulsed with ovalbumin.
[0098]    EXAMPLE 12: In vitro Data
[0099]    Dendritic cells were prepared from cells obtained from the bone marrow of the
femur and tibia of both hind legs of a female C57BL/6J mouse. B16FO murine melanoma
cells were obtained (ATCC (CRL-6322)) and cultured using standard tissue culture
techniques. The dendritic cells were loaded with YCWPs containing B 16F0 tumor lysate
(around 2x10- 5 g/YCWP) at a ratio of 100:1 particles:DC by adding the particles at day 7 of
a dendritic cell culture for a period of 2 hours. Three days prior to the preparation of the
dendritic cells containing tumor lysate loaded particles, female C57BL/6J mice were
challenged with 0.75 x 106 B16F0 melanoma cells in 0.4 ml IX PBS by intravenous
injection. Once the dendritic cells containing tumor lysate loaded particles were prepared,
each mouse in the treatment group was injected intravenously with 2x1 06 of dendritic cells
containing tumor lysate loaded particles and this vaccination was repeated for three weekly
doses. The mice were monitored up to four weeks for pulmonary metastasis.
 [0100]    At the end of four weeks (when one of the control mice died), the mice were
sacrificed and any occurrence of metastases was counted. All four control animals that were
not treated with dendritic cells containing tumor lysate loaded particles had more than
50 tumors. However, none of the treated animals had measurable metastases. This data
                                                -17-

indicates that dendritic cells containing tumor lysate loaded particles is effective in treating
cancer in a proven animal model system. The data are compiled in Table 1.

experiment and Figure 7B shows the lungs of the four treated mice.
[0103]    EXAMPLE 13: In vivo Procedure
[0104]    To vaccinate a subject, a dose of 1.25 million dendritic cells containing tumor lysate
loaded particles can be cryopreserved in 0.2 mL of a serum-free, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide
freezing medium (CryoStorTM CS-10, BioLife Solutinos, Ihc.). Before injection, the dendritic
                                               -18-

cells can be thawed and diluted to a 1 mL with sterile saline for injection containing 5%
human serum albumin (Albuminar -25, Aventis Behring). The dilution can then be
transferred to a 3.0 cc syringe for injection and using a needle no smaller than 23 gauge,
which should be administered within 2 hours of the thawing. The injection can be
administered subcutaneously into an area of lymph nodes.
