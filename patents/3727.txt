                                         BACKGROUND
 [00031      The detection and/or monitoring of glucose levels or other analytes, such as
     lactate, oxygen, Al C, or the like, in certain individuals is vitally important to their
     health. For example, the monitoring of glucose is particularly important to individuals
     with diabetes. Diabetics generally monitor glucose levels to determine if their glucose
     levels are being maintained within a clinically safe range, and may also use this
     information to determine if and/or when insulin is needed to reduce glucose levels in
     their bodies or when additional glucose is needed to raise the level of glucose in their
     bodies.
[0004]       Growing clinical data demonstrates a strong correlation between the frequency of
     glucose monitoring and glycemic control. Despite such correlation, many individuals
     diagnosed with a diabetic condition do not monitor their glucose levels as frequently as
    they should due to a combination of factors including convenience, testing discretion,
    pain associated with glucose testing, and cost.
[0005]       Devices have been developed for the automatic monitoring of analyte(s), such as
     glucose, in bodily fluid such as in the blood stream or in interstitial fluid ("ISF"), or
    other biological fluid. Some of these analyte measuring devices are configured so that
    at least a portion of the devices are positioned below a skin surface of a user, e.g., in a
    blood vessel or in the subcutaneous tissue of a user, so that the monitoring is
    accomplished in vivo.
[0006]      With the continued development of analyte monitoring devices and systems,
    there is a need for such analyte monitoring devices, systems, and methods, as well as
    for processes for manufacturing analyte monitoring devices and systems that are cost
    effective, convenient, and with reduced pain, provide discreet monitoring to encourage
    frequent analyte monitoring to improve glycemic control.
                                           SUMMARY
[0007]      Embodiments of the subject disclosure include in vivo analyte monitoring
    devices, systems, kits, and processes of analyte monitoring and making analyte
    monitoring devices, systems and kits.
[0008]      In an aspect, the present invention provides an apparatus comprising:

                                                 -3
         an analyte sensor having a portion configured to be in fluid contact with bodily
    fluid under a skin surface and configured to generate analyte signals;
         a Bluetooth communication module;
         a data storage unit that stores calibration information; and
    sensor electronics configured to receive the signals generated by the analyte sensor and
   to process the received signals with the calibration information to generate calibrated
    analyte sensor data, and to generate one or more data packets that includes the
   calibrated analyte sensor data so that no user performed calibration is required during
   the entire period of the analyte sensor usage life;
         wherein the communication module is configured to connect with a mobile
   telephone using Bluetooth, and upon connection with the mobile telephone, the sensor
   electronics is configured to control the communication module to communicate the
   generated one or more data packets to the mobile telephone at a programmed
   communication time interval.
[00091     Such device and system with analyte sensors provide continuous or periodic
   analyte level monitoring that is executed automatically, or semi-automatically by
   control logic or routines programmed or programmable in the monitoring devices or
   systems. As used herein, continuous, automatic, and/or periodic monitoring refer to the
   in vivo monitoring or detection of analyte levels with transcutaneously positioned
   analyte sensors.
[00101      In certain embodiments, the results of the in vivo monitored analyte level are
   automatically communicated from an electronics unit to another device or component
   of the system. That is, when the results are available, the results are automatically
   transmitted to a display device (or other user interaction device) of the system, for
   example, according to a fixed or dynamic data communication schedule executed by the
   system. In other embodiments, the results of the in vivo monitored analyte level are not
   automatically communicated, transferred or output to one or more device or component
   of the system. In such embodiments, the results are provided only in response to a
   query to the system. That is, the results are communicated to a component or a device
   of the system only in response to the query or request for such results. In certain
   embodiments, the results of the in vivo monitoring may be logged or stored in a
   memory of the system and only communicated or transferred to another device or
   component of the system after the one or more predetermined monitoring time periods.

                                                 -4
 [00111      Embodiments include software and/or hardware to transform any one of the
     devices, components or systems into any one of the other devices, components or
     systems, where such transformation may be user-configurable after manufacture.
     Transformation modules that include hardware and/or software to accomplish such
     transformation may be mateable to a given system to transform it.
 [0012]      Embodiments include electronics coupled to analyte sensors that provide
     functionalities to operate the analyte sensors for monitoring analyte levels over a
     predetermined monitoring time period such as for example, about 30 days (or more in
     certain embodiments), about 14 days, about 10, about 5 days, about 1 day, less than
     about 1 day. In certain embodiments, the usage life of each analyte sensor may be the
     same as or different from the predetermined monitoring time periods. Components of
    the electronics to provide the functionalities to operate the analyte sensors in certain
     embodiments include control logic or microprocessors coupled to a power supply such
     as a battery to drive the in vivo analyte sensors to perform electrochemical reactions to
     generate resulting signals that correspond to the monitored analyte levels.
 [0013]     Electronics may also include other components such as one or more data storage
    units or memory (volatile and/or non volatile), communication component(s) to
    communicate information corresponding to the in vivo monitored analyte level to a
    display device automatically when the information is available, or selectively in
    response to a request for the monitored analyte level information. Data communication
    between display devices and the electronics units coupled to the sensor may be
    implemented serially (e.g., data transfer between them are not performed at the same
    time), or in parallel. For example, the display device may be configured to transmit a
    signal or data packet to the electronics coupled to the sensor, and upon receipt of the
    transmitted signal or data packet, the electronics coupled to the sensor communicates
    back to the display device. In certain embodiments, a display device may be configured
    to provide RF power and data/signals continually, and detecting or receiving one or
    more return data packet or signal from electronics coupled to the sensor when it is
    within a predetermined RE power range from the display device. In certain
    embodiments, the display device and the electronics coupled to the sensor may be
    configured to transmit one or more data packets at the same time.
[00141      In certain embodiments, the one or more data storage units or memory stores data
   under the control of the electronics. In certain embodiments, the one or more data
    storage units or memory stores data according to a rolling data storage protocol

                                                -5
     executed by the control logic or microprocessors of the electronics. The data may be
     rolled according to time and/or prioritization, or otherwise. For example, a rolling data
     storage protocol may include a First-In/First-Out (FIFO) algorithm, First-In/Last-Out
     (FILO) algorithm, Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) algorithm, Last-In/Last-Out (LILO)
     algorithm. For example, embodiments include displacing the oldest stored data with
     most recent data in an iterative manner, or other rolling data protocol variations thereof.
 [0015]      Embodiments include self powered in vivo analyte sensors that do not require a
     separate power supply to operate the analyte sensors for the detection or monitoring of
    the analyte level. In other words, self powered sensors that provide their own power to
    operate and do not require any other power supply to monitor analyte in vivo are
    described.
 [0016]     Embodiments also include electronics programmed to store or log in the one or
    more data storage units or a memory data associated with the monitored analyte level
    over the sensor usage life or during a monitoring time period. During the monitoring
    time period, information corresponding to the monitored analyte level may be stored
    but not displayed or output during the sensor usage life, and the stored data may be later
    retrieved from memory at the end of the sensor usage life or after the expiration of the
    predetermined monitoring time period, e.g., for clinical analysis, therapy management,
    etc.
[0017]      In certain embodiments, the predetermined monitoring time period may be the
    same as the sensor usage life time period such that when an analyte sensor usage life
    expires (thus no longer used for in vivo analyte level monitoring), the predetermined
   monitoring time period ends. In certain other embodiments, the predetermined
   monitoring time period may include multiple sensor usage life time periods such that
   when an analyte sensor usage life expires, the predetermined monitoring time period
   has not ended, and the expired analyte sensor is replaced with another analyte sensor
   during the same predetermined monitoring time period. The predetermined monitoring
   time period may include the replacement of multiple analyte sensors for use.
[0018]     In certain embodiments, in addition to the monitored analyte level information,
   other information may be communicated to a device, system or a component thereof,
   such as, but not limited to, monitored temperature information, heart rate, one or more
   biomarkers such as HbA I C or the like, stored analyte level information spanning a time
   period, e.g., the past 1 second to about 48 hours, e.g., the past 1 minute to about 24
   hours, e.g., the past about 1 minute to about 10 hours, e.g., the past about 8 hours, or the

                                               -6
    past about 2 hours, or the past about 1 hour, or the past about 30 minutes, or the past
    about 15 minutes.
[0019]     In certain embodiments, temperature (in vivo and/or skin and/or ambient)
    information may be obtained and stored in memory, e.g., to be used in an algorithm to
    compensate for temperature dependent inaccuracies in monitored analyte levels.
[0020]     Analyte level trend information may be generated or constructed based on stored
    analyte level information spanning a time period (e.g., corresponding to a temperature
   time period, or other) and communicated to the display device. The trend information
   may be output graphically and/or audibly and/or tactilely, and/or numerically and/or
   otherwise presented on a user interface of the display device to provide indication of the
   analyte level variation during this time period.
[0021]     Embodiments include wirelessly communicating analyte level information from
   an on body electronics device to a second device such as a display device. Examples of
   communication protocols between on body electronics and the display device may
   include radio frequency identification (RFID) protocols or RF communication
   protocols. Exemplary RFID protocols include but are not limited to near field
   communication protocols that include short communication ranges (e.g., about 12
   inches or less, or about 6 inches or less, or about 3 inches or less, or about 2 inches or
   less), high frequency wireless communication protocols, far field communication
   protocols (e.g., using ultra high frequency (UHF) communication systems) for
   providing signals or data from on body electronics to display devices.
[00221     Communication protocols may use 433 MHz frequency, 13.56 MHz frequency,
   2.45 GHz frequency, or other suitable frequencies for wireless communication between
   the on body electronics that includes electronics coupled to an analyte sensor, and
   display devices and/or other devices such as a personal computer. While certain data
   transmission frequencies and/or data communication ranges are described above, within
   the scope of the present disclosure, other data suitable data transmission frequencies
   and/or data communication ranges may be used between the various devices in the
   analyte monitoring system.
[0023]    Embodiments include data management systems including, for example, a data
   network and/or personal computer and/or a server terminal and/or one or more remote
   computers that are configured to receive collected or stored data from the display
   device for presenting analyte information and/or further processing in conjunction with
   the physiological monitoring for health management. For example, a display device

                                                  -7
    may include one or more communication ports (hard wired or wireless) for connection
    to a data network or a computer terminal to transfer collected or stored analyte related
     data to another device and/or location. Analyte related data in certain embodiment are
     directly communicated from the electronics coupled to the analyte sensor to a personal
    computer, server terminal, and/or remote computers over the data network.
 [0024]     In certain embodiments, calibration "invisible" systems and methods are
    provided that determine clinically accurate analyte concentrations at least over the
    predetermined sensing period of analyte sensor systems without obtaining one or more
    independent analyte measurements (e.g., without using an in vitro test strip or other
    reference device) for calibration of generated analyte related signal from the analyte
    sensor during the usage life of the sensor, i.e., post-manufacture. In other words, once
    the analyte sensors are positioned in the body of the user, control logic or
    microprocessors in the electronics, or the microprocessors in the display device include
    one or more algorithms or programming to accurately convert or correlate signals
    related to the sensed analyte (e.g., in nA, counts, or other appropriate units) to a
    corresponding analyte level (e.g., converted to an analyte level in mg/dL or other
    appropriate units) without a reference value provided to the system, rendering sensor
    calibration "invisible" to the user such that the system does not require any human
    intervention for analyte sensor calibration.
[0025]      These and other features, objects and advantages of the present disclosure will
    become apparent to those persons skilled in the art upon reading the details of the
    present disclosure as more fully described below.
[0026]      As used herein, except where the context requires otherwise, the term "comprise"
    and variations of the term, such as "comprising", "comprises" and "comprised", are not
    intended to exclude other additives, components, integers or steps.

[0060]      Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value,
   to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise,
   between the upper and lower limit of that range and any other stated or intervening
   value in that stated range, is encompassed within the disclosure. The upper and lower
   limits of these smaller ranges may independently be included in the smaller ranges is
   also encompassed within the disclosure, subject to any specifically excluded limit in the
   stated range. Where the stated range includes one or both of the limits, ranges
   excluding either or both of those included limits are also included in the disclosure.
[00611     Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the
   same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this
   disclosure belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those
   described herein can also be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, the
   preferred methods and materials are now described. All publications mentioned herein
   are incorporated herein by reference to disclose and describe the methods and/or
   materials in connection with which the publications are cited.
[00621     It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular
   forms "a", "an", and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates
   otherwise.
[0063]     The publications discussed herein are provided solely for their disclosure prior to
   the filing date of the present application. Nothing herein is to be construed as an
   admission that the present disclosure is not entitled to antedate such publication by
   virtue of prior disclosure. Further, the dates of publication provided may be different
   from the actual publication dates which may need to be independently confirmed.
[00641     As will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading this disclosure, each
   of the individual embodiments described and illustrated herein has discrete components
   and features which may be readily separated from or combined with the features of any
   of the other several embodiments without departing from the scope or spirit of the
   present disclosure.
[0065]     The figures shown herein are not necessarily drawn to scale, with some
   components and features being exaggerated for clarity.
[00661     Generally, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to in vivo methods and
   devices for detecting at least one analyte such as glucose in body fluid. Accordingly,
   embodiments include in vivo analyte sensors configured so that at least a portion of the
   sensor is positioned in the body of a user (e.g., within the ISF), to obtain information

                                                -11
     about at least one analyte of the body, e.g., transcutaneously positioned in user's body.
     In certain embodiments, an in vivo analyte sensor is coupled to an electronics unit that
     is maintained on the body of the user such as on a skin surface, where such coupling
     provides on body, in vivo analyte sensor electronics assemblies.
 [00671      In certain embodiments, analyte information is communicated from a first device
     such as an on body electronics unit to a second device which may include user interface
     features, including a display, and/or the like. Information may be communicated from
    the first device to the second device automatically and/or continuously when the analyte
     information is available, or may not be communicated automatically and/or
     continuously, but rather stored or logged in a memory of the first device. Accordingly,
     in many embodiments of the system, analyte information derived by the sensor/on body
    electronics (for example, on body electronics assembly) is made available in a user
    usable or viewable form only when queried by the user such that the timing of data
    communication is selected by the user.
[0068]      In this manner, analyte information is only provided or evident to a user
    (provided at a user interface device) when desired by the user even though an in vivo
    analyte sensor automatically and/or continuously monitors the analyte level in vivo, i.e.,
    the sensor automatically monitors analyte such as glucose on a pre-defined time interval
    over its usage life. For example, an analyte sensor may be positioned in vivo and
    coupled to on body electronics for a given sensing period, e.g., about 14 days. In
    certain embodiments, the sensor-derived analyte information is automatically
    communicated from the sensor electronics assembly to a remote monitor device or
    display device for output to a user throughout the 14 day period according to a schedule
    programmed at the on body electronics (e.g., about every 1 minute or about every 5
    minutes or about every 10 minutes, or the like). In certain embodiments, sensor
    derived analyte information is only communicated from the sensor electronics assembly
    to a remote monitor device or display device at user-determined times, e.g., whenever a
    user decides to check analyte information. At such times, a communications system is
    activated and sensor-derived information is then sent from the on body electronics to
    the remote device or display device.
[0069]      In still other embodiments, the information may be communicated from the first
    device to the second device automatically and/or continuously when the analyte
    information is available, and the second device stores or logs the received information
    without presenting or outputting the information to the user. In such embodiments, the

                                               -12
    information is received by the second device from the first device when the information
    becomes available (e.g., when the sensor detects the analyte level according to a time
    schedule). However, the received information is initially stored in the second device
    and only output to a user interface or an output component of the second device (e.g.,
    display) upon detection of a request for the information on the second device.
[00701     Accordingly, in certain embodiments once a sensor electronics assembly is
    placed on the body so that at least a portion of the in vivo sensor is in contact with
    bodily fluid such as ISF and the sensor is electrically coupled to the electronics unit,
    sensor derived analyte information may be communicated from the on body electronics
    to a display device on-demand by powering on the display device (or it may be
    continually powered), and executing a software algorithm stored in and accessed from a
    memory of the display device, to generate one or more request commands, control
    signal or data packet to send to the on body electronics. The software algorithm
    executed under, for example, the control of the microprocessor or application specific
    integrated circuit (ASIC) of the display device may include routines to detect the
   position of the on body electronics relative to the display device to initiate the
   transmission of the generated request command, control signal and/or data packet.
[00711     Display devices may also include programming stored in memory for execution
   by one or more microprocessors and/or ASICs to generate and transmit the one or more
   request command, control signal or data packet to send to the on body electronics in
   response to a user activation of an input mechanism on the display device such as
   depressing a button on the display device, triggering a soft button associated with the
   data communication function, and so on. The input mechanism may be alternatively or
   additionally provided on or in the on body electronics which may be configured for user
   activation. In certain embodiments, voice commands or audible signals may be used to
   prompt or instruct the microprocessor or ASIC to execute the software routine(s) stored
   in the memory to generate and transmit the one or more request command, control
   signal or data packet to the on body device. In the embodiments that are voice activated
   or responsive to voice commands or audible signals, on body electronics and/or display
   device includes a microphone, a speaker, and processing routines stored in the
   respective memories of the on body electronics and/or the display device to process the
   voice commands and/or audible signals. In certain embodiments, positioning the on
   body device and the display device within a predetermined distance (e.g., close
   proximity) relative to each other initiates one or more software routines stored in the

                                               -13
    memory of the display device to generate and transmit a request command, control
    signal or data packet.
[00721     Different types and/or forms and/or amounts of information may be sent for each
    on demand reading, including but not limited to one or more of current analyte level
    information (i.e., real time or the most recently obtained analyte level information
    temporally corresponding to the time the reading is initiated), rate of change of an
    analyte over a predetermined time period, rate of the rate of change of an analyte
    (acceleration in the rate of change), historical analyte information corresponding to
    analyte information obtained prior to a given reading and stored in memory of the
    assembly. Some or all of real time, historical, rate of change, rate of rate of change
    (such as acceleration or deceleration) information may be sent to a display device for a
   given reading. In certain embodiments, the type and/or form and/or amount of
   information sent to a display device may be preprogrammed and/or unchangeable (e.g.,
   preset at manufacturing), or may not be preprogrammed and/or unchangeable so that it
   may be selectable and/or changeable in the field one or more times (e.g., by activating a
   switch of the system, etc). Accordingly, in certain embodiments, for each on demand
   reading, a display device will output a current (real time) sensor-derived analyte value
   (e.g., in numerical format), a current rate of analyte change (e.g., in the form of an
   analyte rate indicator such as a arrow pointing in a direction to indicate the current
   rate), and analyte trend history data based on sensor readings acquired by and stored in
   memory of on body electronics (e.g., in the form of a graphical trace). Additionally, the
   on skin or sensor temperature reading or measurement associated with each on demand
   reading may be communicated from the on body electronics to the display device. The
   temperature reading or measurement, however, may not be output or displayed on the
   display device, but rather, used in conjunction with a software routine executed by the
   display device to correct or compensate the analyte measurement output to the user on
   the display device.
[0073]     As described, embodiments include in vivo analyte sensors and on body
   electronics that together provide body wearable sensor electronics assemblies. In certain
   embodiments, in vivo analyte sensors are fully integrated with on body electronics
   (fixedly connected during manufacture), while in other embodiments they are separate
   but connectable post manufacture (e.g., before, during or after sensor insertion into a
   body). On body electronics may include an in vivo glucose sensor, electronics, battery,
   and antenna encased (except for the sensor portion that is for in vivo positioning) in a

                                               -14
    waterproof housing that includes or is attachable to an adhesive pad. In certain
    embodiments, the housing withstands immersion in about one meter of water for up to
    at least 30 minutes. In certain embodiments, the housing withstands continuous
   underwater contact, e.g., for longer than about 30 minutes, and continues to function
   properly according to its intended use, e.g., without water damage to the housing
   electronics where the housing is suitable for water submersion.
[00741      Embodiments include sensor insertion devices, which also may be referred to
   herein as sensor delivery units, or the like. Insertion devices may retain on body
   electronics assemblies completely in an interior compartment, i.e., an insertion device
   may be "pre-loaded" with on body electronics assemblies during the manufacturing
   process (e.g., on body electronics may be packaged in a sterile interior compartment of
   an insertion device). In such embodiments, insertion devices may form sensor
   assembly packages (including sterile packages) for pre-use or new on body electronics
   assemblies, and insertion devices configured to apply on body electronics assemblies to
   recipient bodies.
[0075]      Embodiments include portable handheld display devices, as separate devices and
   spaced apart from an on body electronics assembly, that collect information from the
   assemblies and provide sensor derived analyte readings to users. Such devices may
   also be referred to as meters, readers, monitors, receivers, human interface devices,
   companions, or the like. Certain embodiments may include an integrated in vitro
   analyte meter. In certain embodiments, display devices include one or more wired or
   wireless communications ports such as USB, serial, parallel, or the like, configured to
   establish communication between a display device and another unit (e.g., on body
   electronics, power unit to recharge a battery, a PC, etc). For example, a display device
   communication port may enable charging a display device battery with a respective
   charging cable and/or data exchange between a display device and its compatible
   informatics software.
[00761     Compatible informatics software in certain embodiments include, for example,
   but not limited to stand alone or network connection enabled data management software
   program, resident or running on a display device, personal computer, a server terminal,
   for example, to perform data analysis, charting, data storage, data archiving and data
   communication as well as data synchronization. Informatics software in certain
   embodiments may also include software for executing field upgradable functions to
   upgrade firmware of a display device and/or on body electronics unit to upgrade the

                                                -15
     resident software on the display device and/or the on body electronics unit, e.g., with
     versions of firmware that include additional features and/or include software bugs or
     errors fixed, etc.
 [0077]     Embodiments may include a haptic feedback feature such as a vibration motor or
     the like, configured so that corresponding notifications (e.g., a successful on-demand
    reading received at a display device), may be delivered in the form of haptic feedback.
 [00781     Embodiments include programming embedded on a computer readable medium,
    i.e., computer-based application software (may also be referred to herein as informatics
     software or programming or the like) that processes analyte information obtained from
    the system and/or user self-reported data. Application software may be installed on a
    host computer such as a mobile telephone, PC, an Internet-enabled human interface
    device such as an Internet-enabled phone, personal digital assistant, or the like, by a
    display device or an on body electronics unit. Informatics programming may transform
    data acquired and stored on a display device or on body unit for use by a user.
[00791      Embodiments of the subject disclosure are described primarily with respect to
    glucose monitoring devices and systems, and methods of glucose monitoring, for
    convenience only and such description is in no way intended to limit the scope of the
    disclosure. It is to be understood that the analyte monitoring system may be configured
    to monitor a variety of analytes at the same time or at different times.
[0080]      For example, analytes that may be monitored include, but are not limited to,
    acetyl choline, amylase, bilirubin, cholesterol, chorionic gonadotropin, creatine kinase
    (e.g., CK-MB), creatine, DNA, fructosamine, glucose, glutamine, growth hormones,
    hormones, ketones, lactate, oxygen, peroxide, prostate-specific antigen, prothrombin,
    RNA, thyroid stimulating hormone, and troponin. The concentration of drugs, such as,
    for example, antibiotics (e.g., gentamicin, vancomycin, and the like), digitoxin, digoxin,
    drugs of abuse, theophylline, and warfarin, may also be monitored. In those
    embodiments that monitor more than one analyte, the analytes may be monitored at the
    same or different times, with a single sensor or with a plurality of sensors which may
    use the same on body electronics (e.g., simultaneously) or with different on body
    electronics.
[0081]      As described in detail below, embodiments include devices, systems, kits and/or
    methods to monitor one or more physiological parameters such as, for example, but not
    limited to, analyte levels, temperature levels, heart rate, user activity level, over a
   predetermined monitoring time period. Also provided are methods of manufacturing.

                                               -16
   Predetermined monitoring time periods may be less than about 1 hour, or may include
   about 1 hour or more, e.g., about a few hours or more, e.g., about a few days of more,
   e.g., about 3 or more days, e.g., about 5 days or more, e.g., about 7 days or more, e.g.,
   about 10 days or more, e.g., about 14 days or more, e.g., about several weeks, e.g.,
   about 1 month or more. In certain embodiments, after the expiration of the
   predetermined monitoring time period, one or more features of the system may be
   automatically deactivated or disabled at the on body electronics assembly and/or
   display device.
[00821     For example, a predetermined monitoring time period may begin with
   positioning the sensor in vivo and in contact with a body fluid such as ISF, and/or with
   the initiation (or powering on to full operational mode) of the on body electronics.
   Initialization of on body electronics may be implemented with a command generated
   and transmitted by a display device in response to the activation of a switch and/or by
   placing the display device within a predetermined distance (e.g., close proximity) to the
   on body electronics, or by user manual activation of a switch on the on body electronics
   unit, e.g., depressing a button, or such activation may be caused by the insertion device,
   e.g., as described in U.S. Patent Application No. 12/698,129 filed on February 1, 2010
   and U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 61/238,646, 61/246,825, 61/247,516,
   61/249,535, 61/317,243, 61/345,562, and 61/361,374, the disclosures of each of which
   are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.
[00831     When initialized in response to a received command from a display device, the
   on body electronics retrieves and executes from its memory software routine to fully
   power on the components of the on body electronics, effectively placing the on body
   electronics in full operational mode in response to receiving the activation command
   from the display device. For example, prior to the receipt of the command from the
   display device, a portion of the components in the on body electronics may be powered
   by its internal power supply such as a battery while another portion of the components
   in the on body electronics may be in powered down or low power including no power,
   inactive mode, or all components may be in an inactive mode, powered down mode.
   Upon receipt of the command, the remaining portion (or all) of the components of the
   on body electronics is switched to active, fully operational mode.
[0084]    Embodiments of on body electronics may include one or more printed circuit
   boards with electronics including control logic implemented in ASIC, microprocessors,
   memory, and the like, and transcutaneously positionable analyte sensors forming a

                                                -17
    single assembly. On body electronics may be configured to provide one or more
    signals or data packets associated with a monitored analyte level upon detection of a
    display device of the analyte monitoring system within a predetermined proximity for a
    period of time (for example, about 2 minutes, e.g., 1 minute or less, e.g., about 30
    seconds or less, e.g., about 10 seconds or less, e.g., about 5 seconds or less, e.g., about 2
    seconds or less) and/or until a confirmation, such as an audible and/or visual and/or
   tactile (e.g., vibratory) notification, is output on the display device indicating successful
    acquisition of the analyte related signal from the on body electronics. A distinguishing
   notification may also be output for unsuccessful acquisition in certain embodiments.
[0085]     In certain embodiments, the monitored analyte level may be correlated and/or
   converted to glucose levels in blood or other fluids such as ISF. Such conversion may
   be accomplished with the on body electronics, but in many embodiments will be
   accomplished with display device electronics. In certain embodiments, glucose level is
   derived from the monitored analyte level in the ISF.
[00861     Analyte sensors may be insertable into a vein, artery, or other portion of the body
   containing analyte. In certain embodiments, analyte sensors may be positioned in
   contact with ISF to detect the level of analyte, where the detected analyte level may be
   used to infer the user's glucose level in blood or interstitial tissue.
[00871     Embodiments include transcutaneous sensors and also wholly implantable
   sensors and wholly implantable assemblies in which a single assembly including the
   analyte sensor and electronics are provided in a sealed housing (e.g., hermetically
   sealed biocompatible housing) for implantation in a user's body for monitoring one or
   more physiological parameters.
Embodiments of In Vivo Analyte Monitoring Systems
[00881     FIG. 1 shows an exemplary in vivo-based analyte monitoring system 100 in
   accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown, in certain
   embodiments, analyte monitoring system 100 includes on body electronics 110
   electrically coupled to in vivo analyte sensor 101 (a proximal portion of which is shown
   in FIG. 1) and attached to adhesive layer 140 for attachment on a skin surface on the
   body of a user. On body electronics 110 includes on body housing 119, that defines an
   interior compartment. Also shown in FIG. 1 is insertion device 150 that, when operated,
   transcutaneously positions a portion of analyte sensor 101 through a skin surface and in
   fluid contact with ISF , and positions on body electronics 110 and adhesive layer 140

                                                -18
     on a skin surface In certain embodiments, on body electronics 110, analyte sensor 101
     and adhesive layer 140 are sealed within the housing of insertion device 150 before use,
     and in certain embodiments, adhesive layer 140 is also sealed within the housing or
    itself provides a terminal seal of the insertion device 150. Devices, systems and
    methods that maybe used with embodiments herein are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent
    Application No. 12/698,129 and U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 61/238,646,
    61/246,825, 61/247,516, 61/249,535, 61/317,243, 61/345,562, and 61/361,374, the
    disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.
 [0089]     Referring back to the FIG. 1, analyte monitoring system 100 includes display
    device 120 which includes a display 122 to output information to the user, an input
    component 121 such as a button, actuator, a touch sensitive switch, a capacitive switch,
    pressure sensitive switch, jog wheel or the like, to input data or command to display
    device 120 or otherwise control the operation of display device 120. It is noted that
    some embodiments may include display-less devices or devices without any user
    interface components. These devices may be functionalized to store data as a data
    logger and/or provide a conduit to transfer data from on body electronics and/or a
    display-less device to another device and/or location. Embodiments will be described
    herein as display devices for exemplary purposes which are in no way intended to limit
    the embodiments of the present disclosure. It will be apparent that display-less devices
   may also be used in certain embodiments.
[0090]      In certain embodiments, on body electronics 110 may be configured to store
    some or all of the monitored analyte related data received from analyte sensor 101 in a
   memory during the monitoring time period, and maintain it in memory until the usage
   period ends. In such embodiments, stored data is retrieved from on body electronics
    110 at the conclusion of the monitoring time period, for example, after removing
   analyte sensor 101 from the user by detaching on body electronics 110 from the skin
   surface where it was positioned during the monitoring time period. In such data
   logging configurations, real time monitored analyte level is not communicated to
   display device 120 during the monitoring period or otherwise transmitted from on body
   electronics 110, but rather, retrieved from on body electronics 110 after the monitoring
   time period.
[0091]     In certain embodiments, input component 121 of display device 120 may include
   a microphone and display device 120 may include software configured to analyze audio
   input received from the microphone, such that functions and operation of the display

                                                -19
    device 120 may be controlled by voice commands. In certain embodiments, an output
    component of display device 120 includes a speaker for outputting information as
    audible signals. Similar voice responsive components such as a speaker, microphone
    and software routines to generate, process and store voice driven signals may be
    provided to on body electronics 110.
 [0092]     In certain embodiments, display 122 and input component 121 may be integrated
    into a single component, for example a display that can detect the presence and location
    of a physical contact touch upon the display such as a touch screen user interface. In
    such embodiments, the user may control the operation of display device 120 by
    utilizing a set of pre-programmed motion commands, including, but not limited to,
    single or double tapping the display, dragging a finger or instrument across the display,
    motioning multiple fingers or instruments toward one another, motioning multiple
    fingers or instruments away from one another, etc. In certain embodiments, a display
    includes a touch screen having areas of pixels with single or dual function capacitive
   elements that serve as LCD elements and touch sensors.
[0093]       Display device 120 also includes data communication port 123 for wired data
   communication with external devices such as remote terminal (personal computer) 170,
   for example. Example embodiments of the data communication port 123 include USB
   port, mini USB port, RS-232 port, Ethernet port, Firewire port, or other similar data
   communication ports configured to connect to the compatible data cables. Display
   device 120 may also include an integrated in vitro glucose meter, including in vitro test
   strip port 124 to receive an in vitro glucose test strip for performing in vitro blood
   glucose measurements.
[0094]     Referring still to FIG. 1, display 122 in certain embodiments is configured to
   display a variety of information - some or all of which may be displayed at the same or
   different time on display 122. In certain embodiments the displayed information is user
   selectable so that a user can customize the information shown on a given display screen.
   Display 122 may include but is not limited to graphical display 138, for example,
   providing a graphical output of glucose values over a monitored time period (which
   may show important markers such as meals, exercise, sleep, heart rate, blood pressure,
   etc, numerical display 132, for example, providing monitored glucose values (acquired
   or received in response to the request for the information), and trend or directional

 [0095]    As further shown in FIG. 1, display 222 may also include date display 135
    providing for example, date information for the user, time of day information display
     139 providing time of day information to the user, battery level indicator display 133
    which graphically shows the condition of the battery (rechargeable or disposable) of the
    display device 120, sensor calibration status icon display 134 for example, in
    monitoring systems that require periodic, routine or a predetermined number of user
    calibration events, notifying the user that the analyte sensor calibration is necessary,
    audio/vibratory settings icon display 136 for displaying the status of the audio/vibratory
    output or alarm state, and wireless connectivity status icon display 137 that provides
    indication of wireless communication connection with other devices such as on body
    electronics, data processing module160, and/or remote terminal 170. As additionally
    shown in FIG. 1, display 122 may further include simulated touch screen button 125,
    126 for accessing menus, changing display graph output configurations or otherwise for
    controlling the operation of display device 120.
[0096]     Referring back to FIG. 1, in certain embodiments, display 122 of display device
    120 may be additionally, or instead of visual display, configured to output alarms
   notifications such as alarm and/or alert notifications, glucose values etc, which may be
   audible, tactile, or any combination thereof. In one aspect, the display device 120 may
   include other output components such as a speaker, vibratory output component and the
   like to provide audible and/or vibratory output indication to the user in addition to the
   visual output indication provided on display 122. Further details and other display
   embodiments can be found in, e.g., U.S. Patent Application No. 12/871,901, U.S.
   provisional application nos. 61/238,672, 61/247,541, 61/297,625, the disclosures of
   each of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.
[0097]     After the positioning of on body electronics 110 on the skin surface and analyte
   sensor 101 in vivo to establish fluid contact with ISF (or other appropriate body fluid),
   on body electronics 110 in certain embodiments is configured to wirelessly
   communicate analyte related data (such as, for example, data corresponding to
   monitored analyte level and/or monitored temperature data, and/or stored historical
   analyte related data) when on body electronics 110 receives a command or request
   signal from display device 120. In certain embodiments, on body electronics 110 may
   be configured to at least periodically broadcast real time data associated with monitored
   analyte level which is received by display device 120 when display device 120 is within

                                                 -21
     communication range of the data broadcast from on body electronics 110, i.e., it does
     not need a command or request from a display device to send information.
 [00981     For example, display device 120 may be configured to transmit one or more
     commands to on body electronics 110 to initiate data transfer, and in response, on body
     electronics 110 may be configured to wirelessly transmit stored analyte related data
     collected during the monitoring time period to display device 120. Display device 120
     may in turn be connected to a remote terminal 170 such as a personal computer and
     functions as a data conduit to transfer the stored analyte level information from the on
    body electronics 110 to remote terminal 170. In certain embodiments, the received data
    from the on body electronics 110 may be stored (permanently or temporarily) in one or
    more memory of the display device 120. In certain other embodiments, display device
     120 is configured as a data conduit to pass the data received from on body electronics
     110 to remote terminal 170 that is connected to display device 120.
[0099]      Referring still to FIG. 1, also shown in analyte monitoring system 100 are data
    processing module 160 and remote terminal 170. Remote terminal 170 may include a
    personal computer, a server terminal a laptop computer or other suitable data processing
    devices including software for data management and analysis and communication with
    the components in the analyte monitoring system 100. For example, remote terminal
    170 may be connected to a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or
    other data network for uni-directional or bi-directional data communication between
    remote terminal 170 and display device 120 and/or data processing module 160.
[001001 Remote terminal 170 in certain embodiments may include one or more computer
   terminals located at a physician's office or a hospital. For example, remote terminal 170
   may be located at a location other than the location of display device 120. Remote
   terminal 170 and display device 120 could be in different rooms or different buildings.
   Remote terminal 170 and display device 120 could be at least about one mile apart, e.g.,
   at least about 10 miles apart, e.g., at least about 100 miles apart. For example, remote
   terminal 170 could be in the same city as display device 120, remote terminal 170 could
   be in a different city than display device 120, remote terminal 170 could be in the same
   state as display device 120, remote terminal 170 could be in a different state than
   display device 120, remote terminal 170 could be in the same country as display device
   120, or remote terminal 170 could be in a different country than display device 120, for
   example.

                                               -22
 [00101] In certain embodiments, a separate, optional data communication/processing
    device such as data processing module 160 may be provided in analyte monitoring
    system 100. Data processing module 160 may include components to communicate
    using one or more wireless communication protocols such as, for example, but not
    limited to, infrared (IR) protocol, Bluetooth protocol, Zigbee protocol, and 802.11
    wireless LAN protocol. Additional description of communication protocols including
   those based on Bluetooth protocol and/or Zigbee protocol can be found in U.S. Patent
    Publication No. 2006/0193375 incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Data
   processing module 160 may further include communication ports, drivers or connectors
   to establish wired communication with one or more of display device 120, on body
   electronics 110, or remote terminal 170 including, for example, but not limited to USB
   connector and/or USB port, Ethernet connector and/or port, FireWire connector and/or
   port, or RS-232 port and/or connector.
[00102] In certain embodiments, data processing module 160 is programmed to transmit a
   polling or query signal to on body electronics 110 at a predetermined time interval (e.g.,
   once every minute, once every five minutes, or the like), and in response, receive the
   monitored analyte level information from on body electronics 110. Data processing
   module 160 stores in its memory the received analyte level information, and/or relays
   or retransmits the received information to another device such as display device 120.
   More specifically in certain embodiments, data processing module 160 may be
   configured as a data relay device to retransmit or pass through the received analyte
   level data from on body electronics 110 to display device 120 or a remote terminal (for
   example, over a data network such as a cellular or WiFi data network) or both.
[00103] In certain embodiments, on body electronics 110 and data processing module 160
   may be positioned on the skin surface of the user within a predetermined distance of
   each other (for example, about 1-12 inches, or about 1-10 inches, or about 1-7 inches,
   or about 1-5 inches) such that periodic communication between on body electronics 110
   and data processing module 160 is maintained. Alternatively, data processing module
   160 may be worn on a belt or clothing item of the user, such that the desired distance
   for communication between the on body electronics 110 and data processing module
   160 for data communication is maintained. In a further aspect, the housing of data
   processing module 160 may be configured to couple to or engage with on body
   electronics 110 such that the two devices are combined or integrated as a single
   assembly and positioned on the skin surface. In further embodiments, data processing

                                              -23
    module 160 is detachably engaged or connected to on body electronics 110 providing
    additional modularity such that data processing module 160 may be optionally removed
    or reattached as desired.
[001041 Referring again to FIG. 1, in certain embodiments, data processing module 160 is
    programmed to transmit a command or signal to on body electronics 110 at a
    predetermined time interval such as once every minute, or once every 5 minutes or once
    every 30 minutes or any other suitable or desired programmable time interval to request
    analyte related data from on body electronics 110. When data processing module 160
    receives the requested analyte related data, it stores the received data. In this manner,
    analyte monitoring system 100 may be configured to receive the continuously
    monitored analyte related information at the programmed or programmable time
    interval, which is stored and/or displayed to the user. The stored data in data
    processing module 160 may be subsequently provided or transmitted to display device
    120, remote terminal 170 or the like for subsequent data analysis such as identifying
    frequency of periods of glycemic level excursions over the monitored time period, or
   the frequency of the alarm event occurrence during the monitored time period, for
    example, to improve therapy related decisions. Using this information, the doctor,
   healthcare provider or the user may adjust or recommend modification to the diet, daily
   habits and routines such as exercise, and the like.
[00105] In another embodiment, data processing module 160 transmits a command or
   signal to on body electronics 110 to receive the analyte related data in response to a
   user activation of a switch provided on data processing module 160 or a user initiated
   command received from display device 120. In further embodiments, data processing
   module 160 is configured to transmit a command or signal to on body electronics 110
   in response to receiving a user initiated command only after a predetermined time
   interval has elapsed. For example, in certain embodiments, if the user does not initiate
   communication within a programmed time period, such as, for example about 5 hours
   from last communication (or 10 hours from the last communication, or 24 hours from
   the last communication), the data processing module 160 may be programmed to
   automatically transmit a request command or signal to on body electronics 110.
   Alternatively, data processing module 160 may be programmed to activate an alarm to
   notify the user that a predetermined time period of time has elapsed since the last
   communication between the data processing module 160 and on body electronics 110.
   In this manner, users or healthcare providers may program or configure data processing

                                                -24
    module 160 to provide certain compliance with analyte monitoring regimen, so that
    frequent determination of analyte levels is maintained or performed by the user.
 [001061 In certain embodiments, when a programmed or programmable alarm condition
    is detected (for example, a detected glucose level monitored by analyte sensor 101 that
    is outside a predetermined acceptable range indicating a physiological condition which
    requires attention or intervention for medical treatment or analysis (for example, a
    hypoglycemic condition, a hyperglycemic condition, an impending hyperglycemic
    condition or an impending hypoglycemic condition), the one or more output indications
    may be generated by the control logic or processor of the on body electronics 110 and
    output to the user on a user interface of on body electronics 110 so that corrective
    action may be timely taken. In addition to or alternatively, if display device 120 is
    within communication range, the output indications or alarm data may be
    communicated to display device 120 whose processor, upon detection of the alarm data
    reception, controls the display 122 to output one or more notification.
[00107] In certain embodiments, control logic or microprocessors of on body electronics
    110 include software programs to determine future or anticipated analyte levels based
    on information obtained from analyte sensor 101, e.g., the current analyte level, the rate
    of change of the analyte level, the acceleration of the analyte level change, and/or
    analyte trend information determined based on stored monitored analyte data providing
    a historical trend or direction of analyte level fluctuation as function time during
    monitored time period. Predictive alarm parameters may be programmed or
    programmable in display device 120, or the on body electronics 110, or both, and
    output to the user in advance of anticipating the user's analyte level reaching the future
    level. This provides the user an opportunity to take timely corrective action.
[00108] Information, such as variation or fluctuation of the monitored analyte level as a
    function of time over the monitored time period providing analyte trend information,
   for example, may be determined by one or more control logic or microprocessors of
   display device 120, data processing module 160, and/or remote terminal 170, and/or on
   body electronics 110. Such information may be displayed as, for example, a graph
   (such as a line graph) to indicate to the user the current and/or historical and/or and
   predicted future analyte levels as measured and predicted by the analyte monitoring
   system 100. Such information may also be displayed as directional arrows (for
   example, see trend or directional arrow display 131) or other icon(s), e.g., the position
   of which on the screen relative to a reference point indicated whether the analyte level

                                                -25
   is increasing or decreasing as well as the acceleration or deceleration of the increase or
   decrease in analyte level. This information may be utilized by the user to determine
   any necessary corrective actions to ensure the analyte level remains within an
   acceptable and/or clinically safe range. Other visual indicators, including colors,
   flashing, fading, etc., as well as audio indicators including a change in pitch, volume, or
   tone of an audio output and/or vibratory or other tactile indicators may also be
   incorporated into the display of trend data as means of notifying the user of the current
   level and/or direction and/or rate of change of the monitored analyte level. For example,
   based on a determined rate of glucose change, programmed clinically significant
   glucose threshold levels (e.g., hyperglycemic and/or hypoglycemic levels), and current
   analyte level derived by an in vivo analyte sensor, the system 100 may include an
   algorithm stored on computer readable medium to determine the time it will take to
   reach a clinically significant level and will output notification in advance of reaching
   the clinically significant level, e.g., 30 minutes before a clinically significant level is
   anticipated, and/or 20 minutes, and/or 10 minutes, and/or 5 minutes, and/or 3 minutes,
   and/or 1 minute, and so on, with outputs increasing in intensity or the like.
[00109] Referring again back to FIG. 1, in certain embodiments, software algorithm(s)
   for execution by data processing module 160 may be stored in an external memory
   device such as an SD card, microSD card, compact flash card, XD card, Memory Stick
   card, Memory Stick Duo card, or USB memory stick/device including executable
   programs stored in such devices for execution upon connection to the respective one or
   more of the on body electronics 110, remote terminal 170 or display device 120. In a
   further aspect, software algorithms for execution by data processing module 160 may
   be provided to a communication device such as a mobile telephone including, for
   example, WiFi or Internet enabled smart phones or personal digital assistants (PDAs) as
   a downloadable application for execution by the downloading communication device.
[00110] Examples of smart phones include Windows, Android M , iPhone* operating
   system, Palm* WebOSTM, Blackberry operating system, or Symbian* operating
   system based mobile telephones with data network connectivity functionality for data
   communication over an internet connection and/or a local area network (LAN). PDAs
   as described above include, for example, portable electronic devices including one or
   more microprocessors and data communication capability with a user interface (e.g.,
   display/output unit and/or input unit, and configured for performing data processing,
   data upload/download over the internet, for example. In such embodiments, remote

                                              -26
   terminal 170 may be configured to provide the executable application software to the
   one or more of the communication devices described above when communication
   between the remote terminal 170 and the devices are established.
[00111] In still further embodiments, executable software applications may be provided
   over-the-air (OTA) as an OTA download such that wired connection to remote terminal
   170 is not necessary. For example, executable applications may be automatically
   downloaded as software download to the communication device, and depending upon
   the configuration of the communication device, installed on the device for use
   automatically, or based on user confirmation or acknowledgement on the
   communication device to execute the installation of the application. The OTA
   download and installation of software may include software applications and/or
   routines that are updates or upgrades to the existing functions or features of data
   processing module 160 and/or display device 120.
[00112] Referring back to remote terminal 170 of FIG. 1, in certain embodiments, new
   software and/or software updates such as software patches or fixes, firmware updates or
   software driver upgrades, among others, for display device 120 and/or on body
   electronics 110 and/or data processing module 160 may be provided by remote terminal
    170 when communication between the remote terminal 170 and display device 120
   and/or data processing module 160 is established. For example, software upgrades,
   executable programming changes or modification for on body electronics 110 may be
   received from remote terminal 170 by one or more of display device 120 or data
   processing module 160, and thereafter, provided to on body electronics 110 to update
   its software or programmable functions. For example, in certain embodiments,
   software received and installed in on body electronics 110 may include software bug
   fixes, modification to the previously stalled software parameters (modification to
   analyte related data storage time interval, resetting or adjusting time base or information
   of on body electronics 110, modification to the transmitted data type, data transmission
   sequence, or data storage time period, among others). Additional details describing
   field upgradability of software of portable electronic devices, and data processing are
   provided in U.S. Application Nos. 12/698,124, 12/794,721, 12/699,653, and
    12/699,844, and U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 61,359,265, and 61/325,155 the
   disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.

 Embodiments of On-Body Electronics Units
 [001131 FIGS. 2A-2B are perspective and top cross sectional views, respectively, of on
    body electronics 110 of FIG. 1 in certain embodiments. In particular, FIG. 2A
    illustrates the cross-sectional view of on body electronics 110 along the dotted line A
    shown in FIG. 2B. Referring to FIGS. 2A-2B, on body electronics 110 in certain
    embodiments is sized and shaped such that the height or thickness profile is minimized
    (for example, to less than or equal to about 10 mm, e.g., or less than or equal to about 7
    mm, e.g., or less than or equal to about 5 mm, e.g., or less than or equal to about 4.5
    mm, e.g., or less than or equal to about 4 mm or less). For example, as shown in the
    figures, in certain embodiments, on body electronics 110 includes a dome-like or
    tapered shape with a height or thickness dimension of up to about 5 mm at its thickest
    point, and may taper (gradually or step wise) to a height or thickness dimension of less
    than about 4 mm, or about 3mm or less, or about 2 mm or less, or about 1 mm or less.
    In certain embodiments, on body electronics 110 has a compact z-height 118 (e.g.,
    height or thickness of on body electronics 110) that is not more than about 4.5mm thick
    at its thickest area (if the thickness is not uniform or rather varies within a given unit),
    and no more than about 4.6 mm thick including an adhesive patch.
[001141 Referring to FIGS. 2A-2B, in certain embodiments, analyte sensor 101 is
    assembled during manufacturing with on body electronics 110, for example, and
    fixedly connected to PCB 111 of on body electronics 110. As shown in FIGS. 2A-2B,
    proximal portion 102 of sensor 101 is placed on upper surface 112 of PCB 111 and
    secured to PCB 111 for example, using rivets, fasteners, clamps or the like. The fixedly
    positioned proximal portion 102 of sensor 101 may be positioned such that proximal
    portion 102 is electrically coupled to the respective contact points on upper surface 112
    of PCB 111. As can be further seen from FIGS. 2A-2B, in such embodiments, the
    distal portion 103 of sensor 101 is bent or angled such that approximately a 90 degree
    angle is defined between the proximal portion 102 and distal portion 103 of sensor 101.
    In certain embodiments, the angle between the proximal portion 102 and distal portion
    103 of sensor 101 may be less than about 90 degrees, less than about 80 degrees, less
   than about 70 degrees, less than about 60 degrees, less than about 50 degrees, less than
   about 40 degrees, less than about 30 degrees, less than about 20 degrees, or less than
   about 10 degrees.
[001151 Referring still to FIG. 2A-2B, as shown, sensor 101 is positioned relative to PCB
    111 such that sensor 101 is positioned through opening 109 defined between upper

                                                -28
    surface 112 and lower surface 113 of PCB 111. In certain embodiments, PCBs of on
    body electronics do not include an opening such as that shown in FIGS. 2A-2B.
 [001161 Furthermore, adhesive layer 140 (single sided or two sided) may be provided to
    securely position on body electronics 110 on the skin surface during and after sensor
    deployment. Adhesive may be manufactured so to be attached to the on body unit, or to
    be attachable post manufacturing, e.g., by a user. In certain embodiments, a sensor
    insertion process causes the adhesive patch to be attached to the on body unit. In certain
    embodiments, on body electronics 110 with analyte sensor 101 may be contained or
    disposed (e.g., during manufacturing) within insertion device 150 (FIG. 1), avoiding the
    need for a user to align, position, or otherwise connect or couple analyte sensor 101 and
    on body electronics 110 to insertion device 150 (FIG. 1) prior to the insertion of analyte
    sensor 101 and initializing on body electronics 110. In certain embodiments, an
    optional sensor guide 105 is provided to further assist in alignment of the analyte sensor
    101 with insertion device 150. Thus, potential misuse, user error, or misalignment of
    analyte sensor 101 relative to a needle or insertion mechanism of insertion device 150
    by the user may be avoided.
[001171 Referring to FIGS. 2A-2B, embodiments of on body electronics 110 include
    dimensions and weight that are optimized for reduction and thus maximized for comfort
    in use and wear. In certain embodiments, on body electronics 110 has a small on-body
    footprint, e.g., less than about 50 mm in diameter excluding adhesive patch 140 e.g.,
    less than about 45 mm in diameter excluding adhesive patch 140, e.g., less than about
    40 mm in diameter excluding adhesive patch 140, e.g., less than about 35 mm in
    diameter excluding adhesive patch 140, e.g., less than about 30 mm in diameter
    excluding adhesive patch 140, where in certain embodiments the on-body footprint may
    be about 25 mm to about 28 mm excluding adhesive patch 140.
[00118] In certain embodiments, on body electronics 110, including adhesive patch 140,
    has an on-body footprint that is less than about 70 mm in diameter (at its widest if isn't
    uniform), e.g., less than about 65 mm in diameter, e.g., less than about 60 mm in
    diameter, e.g., less than about 55 mm in diameter, e.g., less than about 50 mm in
    diameter, e.g., less than about 45 mm in diameter, e.g., less than about 40 mm in
    diameter, where in certain embodiments the on-body footprint may be about 35 mm to
   about 37 mm including adhesive patch 140.
[001191 In certain embodiments, adhesive patch 140 has an on body footprint that is less
   than about 3.0 inches in diameter, e.g., less than about 2.0 inches in diameter, less than

                                                 -29
     about 1.0 inches in diameter, where in certain embodiments an adhesive patch may
     have a diameter that is 1.0 inch to about 1.5 inches or less.
  [001201 Embodiments include on body electronics 110 that has a small surface area, e.g.,
     less than about 2 square inches excluding adhesive patch 140, e.g., less than about 1.5
     square inches excluding adhesive patch 140, e.g., less than about 1 square inches
     excluding adhesive patch 140, e.g., less than about 0.9 square inches excluding
     adhesive patch 140, e.g., less than about 0.8 square inches excluding adhesive patch
      140, e.g., less than about 0.75 square inches excluding adhesive patch 140, e.g., less
     than about .7 square inches excluding adhesive patch 140, where in certain
     embodiments the surface area of an on body electronics unit may be about 0.75 square
     inches to about 0.79 square inches excluding an adhesive patch.
 [001211 In certain embodiments, on body electronics 110, including adhesive patch 140,
     has a surface area that is about 3.0 square inches or less including an adhesive patch,
     e.g., about 2.0 square inches or less including an adhesive patch, e.g., about 1.9 square
     inches or less including an adhesive patch, e.g., about 1.8 square inches or less
     including an adhesive patch, e.g., about 1.75 square inches or less including an adhesive
    patch, e.g., about 1.6 square inches or less including an adhesive patch, where in certain
    embodiments the surface area of an on body electronics unit may be about 1.75 square
    inches to about 1.77 square inches or less.
 [001221 In certain embodiments, on body electronics 110 may have a circular footprint
    and/or adhesive patch 140 may have a circular footprint. In certain embodiments, on
    body electronics 110 may be circular in shape. Other shapes for on body electronics
    and/or adhesive patches include, but are not limited to oval, rectangle, square triangle,
    or polygon shapes may also be used, as well as irregular and complex shapes.
[00123] In certain embodiments, on body electronics 110 has low mass, e.g., less than
    about 10 grams including adhesive patch 140 e.g., less than about 5 grams including
    adhesive patch 140, less than about 3.5 grams including adhesive patch 140, wherein
    certain embodiments the mass is no more than 3 grams including adhesive patch 140.
[00124] FIG. 3 illustrates a PCB for use in on body electronics in certain embodiments.
    Referring to FIG. 3, PCB 300 in certain embodiments includes a plurality of notches
    3 1Oa-310i around an outer periphery of PCB 300. In certain embodiments, notches
    31 Oa-3 1Oi provide a flowpath during manufacturing for an overmold material to
    encapsulate first and second surfaces 320, 330 of PCB 300 within a housing of an on
    body electronics. Referring still to FIG. 3, in certain embodiments, notch 340 is

                                              -30
    additionally provided on the outer periphery of PCB 300 to receive and retain a battery
    350. As shown, battery 350 in certain embodiments is securely retained within notch
    340 of PCB 300 using securement element 360 that is fixedly retained on first surface
    320 of PCB 300. In certain embodiments, securement element 360 is configured as
    battery contact terminal to connect the battery to a respective electrical contact on PCB
    300 to provided power to the components of PCB 300 in an on body electronics. In
    certain embodiments, PCB 300 may be encapsulated after all the components including
    battery 350 and securement element 360 are assembled.
[00125] Referring still to FIG. 3, in certain embodiments, an antenna 390 for wireless
    communication may include surface mounted inductors 391a-391j provided between
    each of the plurality of notches 310a-310i and 340 of PCB 300 either on a top and/or
    bottom surface of PCB 300, or at the edge surface of PCB 300 within notches 310a
    310i, similar to battery 350 in notch 340. In addition, in certain embodiments, surface
   mounted thermisters 370, 380 are provided on first and second surfaces 320, 330 of
   PCB 300 to detect/monitor on skin temperature and ambient temperature.
[00126] FIG. 4A illustrates a side view of on body electronics 400 in certain
   embodiments. Referring to FIG. 4A, on body electronics 400 includes housing 410
   with PCB 411 provided therein, PCB 411 having a portion in electrical contact with
   analyte sensor 401 such that proximal portion 402 of analyte sensor 401 is electrically
   connected to bottom surface 411 A of PCB 411 while distal portion 403 of analyte
   sensor 401 protrudes outwards or downwards from bottom surface 41 OA of on body
   electronics 400. Distal portion 403 of analyte sensor 401 is maintained in fluid contact
   with, for example, ISF under the skin layer when on body electronics 400 is positioned
   on the skin surface with analyte sensor 401 transcutaneously positioned for analyte
   monitoring.
[001271    Referring to FIG. 4A, in certain embodiments, PCB 411 and the proximal portion
   402 of analyte sensor 401 may be encapsulated either partially or entirely, with potting
   material. Encapsulation of PCB 411 and proximal portion 402 of analyte sensor 401
   provides protection of the electronic components provided on PCB 411 from
   contaminants and/or moisture. In certain embodiments, PCB 411 includes a data
   processing or control unit such as one or more microprocessors and/or ASICs, one or
   more memory or data storage devices such as random access memory (RAM), read
   only memory (ROM) and the like, to store data and programming and/or control logic
   or routines to perform the operations related to the processing of signals received from

                                                -31
    analyte sensor 401. Data processing or control unit may be programmed to perform
    signal processing such as, for example, but not limited to, analog to digital conversion,
    signal filtering, storage, data transmission and reception.
[00128] Referring still to FIG. 4A, in certain embodiments, analyte sensor 401 is
   permanently connected to PCB 411, such that the respective electrical contacts of the
    sensor including electrical contacts for one or more of the electrodes including, for
   example, a working electrode, a counter electrode, a reference or a counter/reference
   electrode, in a three electrode system are permanently maintained in electrical
   communication with respective electrical contacts on PCB 411. In other words, during
   manufacturing and assembly, analyte sensor 401 and PCB 411 are permanently
   connected together to provide a fixed electrical coupling. In this manner, in certain
   embodiments, on body electronics 400 is disabled, deactivated or no longer used after
   the expiration of the sensor useful life.
[00129] FIG. 4B illustrates a side view of PCB 411 in contact with analyte sensor 401 in
   certain embodiments with housing 400 removed. Referring to FIG. 4B, analyte sensor
   401 is physically attached to PCB 411 without any substantial or significant stress or
   pressure upon the body of analyte sensor 401 to either bend or otherwise deform the
   shape of analyte sensor 401 in order to connect the electrodes of analyte sensor 401 to
   respective electrical contacts on PCB 411 (however, the sensor could be bent if desired,
   for example, to further minimize the height of the on body electronics assembly). That
   is, as discussed further in conjunction with FIG. 5 below, sensor 401 may be connected
   to PCB 411 using an interconnect component that provides electrical connection or
   coupling between analyte sensor 401 and PCB 411 without deforming or otherwise
   bending of flexing the body of analyte sensor 401 in order to make the electrical
   connection.
[001301 FIG. 5 is a perspective, exploded view of the components of PCB 411 in contact
   with the analyte sensor 401 shown in FIG. 4B in certain embodiments. Referring to
   FIG. 5, proximal portion 402 of analyte sensor 401 is connected to PCB 411 using a
   conductive film 530 and an interconnect component 510 that includes conductive
   material 520. That is, in certain embodiments, conductive film 530 is positioned
   between the proximal portion 402 of analyte sensor 401 and interconnect component
   510 such that when analyte sensor 401, conductive film 530 and interconnect
   component 510 are physically attached, the electrical connection of each of the

                                                 -32
     electrodes of the analyte sensor 401 is maintained via the conductive film 530 and
     interconnect component 510 to PCB 411.
 [00131] In certain embodiments, conductive film 530 includes conductive traces or
     contact points that electrically couple with respective electrical contacts on the proximal
     portion 402 of analyte sensor 401 to provide a continuous electrical signal path for
     electrodes of the analyte sensor 401. Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 5, conductive film
     530 in certain embodiments may be configured to provide electrical conductivity at
     least two (e.g., opposing) surfaces of its body such that when the two surfaces of the
     conductive film 530 are physically coupled to the interconnect component 510, the
     continuous electrical signal path for each of the electrodes of the analyte sensor 401 is
     maintained via the interconnect component 510 to PCB 411.
 [001321 Referring still to FIG. 5, in certain embodiments, the interconnect component
     510 may include a three-sided or more configuration, e.g., a substantially triangular
     shape or the like. For example, a triangularly shaped interconnect may have a first
     surface in contact with the respective surface of the conductive film 530, while a second
     surface of the interconnect component 510 configured for electrical contact with the
     electrical contact points on PCB 411 is substantially at a right angle relative to the first
     surface of the interconnect component 510. The defined angular relationship between
    the first and second surfaces respectively coupling to conductive film 530 and the
     contact points on PCB 411 substantially define the transcutaneous insertion angle of the
     analyte sensor 401 relative to PCB 411 of on body electronics 410 (FIG. 4). In certain
    embodiments, this geometry of interconnect component 510 facilitates the electrical
    connection between the electrodes of the analyte sensor 401 and the respective
    electrical contact points on PCB 411 without physically modifying the configuration of
    either the analyte sensor 401 or PCB 411. Of course, other geometries could be
    employed as well. For example, different geometries (e.g., based on angular
    relationships between a first and second surface) of interconnect component 510
    provides varied insertion angle of analyte sensor 101 such as, for example, about 90
    degree or less, e.g., about 80 degrees or less, about 70 degrees or less, about 60 degrees
    or less, about 50 degrees or less, about 40 degrees or less, about 30 degrees or less, or
    about 20 degrees or less, relative to the skin surface.
[00133] In certain embodiments, conductive film 530 includes an anisotropic conductive
    film while the interconnect component 510 includes molded components which, in
    combination provide for a reduced height or z-profile 420 of the on body electronics

                                               -33
   400 resulting from, for example, the geometry of the interconnect component 510 that
   provides a planar surface for connection or coupling with analyte sensor 401 and
   another planar surface for connection to PCB 411. Embodiments also include
   conductive film 530 that is isotropic, or die cut. In this manner, in certain
   embodiments, the configuration of the interconnect component 510 provides
   mechanical fixturing and electrical connection of analyte sensor 401 to PCB 411 of on
   body electronics 400.
[00134] FIG. 6 is a close up detailed perspective view of analyte sensor 401, conductive
   film 530 and the interconnect component 510 shown in FIG. 5 in certain embodiments.
   FIG. 7A is a bottom perspective view of the interconnect component 510 shown in FIG.
   6 while FIG. 7B is a top perspective view of the interconnect component 510 shown in
   FIG. 6 in certain embodiments. As can be seen from the figures, analyte sensor 401,
   conductive film 530 and interconnect component 510 in certain embodiments are sized
   and shaped to be mated or physically coupled to each other with the conductive film
   530 disposed between the respective surfaces of the analyte sensor 401 proximal
   portion 402 and the first contacting surface of the interconnect component 510.
[00135] In this manner, electrical contacts 520 of interconnect component 510 are
   maintained in signal communication with the respective electrodes of analyte sensor
   401 via the conductive film 530 (and to the respective contact points on the printed
   circuit board (PCB) 411 of on body electronics 410) such that when ready to use, on
   body device electronics 410 includes PCB 411 connected to analyte sensor 401 in a
   fixed position relative to each other. Further, as discussed, PCB 411 may be fully or
   partially encapsulated with potting material such as epoxy, polyurethane or other
   suitable material or compounds to, for example, protect the components of on body
   electronics 410 from contaminants or moisture.
[00136] In certain embodiments, the conductive film 530 may include anisotropic
   conductive adhesive film, e.g., such as those available from 3M Corporation, St. Paul,
   Minnesota, which is heat bondable, electrically conductive and include a thermosetting
   epoxy/acrylate adhesive matrix with conductive particles that allow interconnection of
   circuit lines through the adhesive thickness after bonding while providing sufficient
   space or gap for electrical insulation in the plane of the adhesive.
[00137] Furthermore, referring back to FIGS. 5-7B, the interconnect component 510 in
   certain embodiments may be manufactured using one or more processes of injection
   molding, laser activation and/or metallization to provide electrical conductive paths (for

                                               -34
    example, as shown on the surfaces of the interconnect component 510), or assembly
    procedure to form the desired three dimensional triangular shape with two conductive
    surfaces at substantially a 90 degree angle relative to each other as shown, for example,
    in FIGS. 5-7B. In certain embodiments, the two conductive surfaces may be formed at
    an angle greater or less than 90 degrees relative to each other.
 [00138] Additionally, in certain embodiments, interconnect component 530 may be
    configured to be used as a spacer component for a temperature probe (for example,
    thermister, a thermocouple, or a resistive thermal device (RTD, or sometimes referred
    to as resistance temperature detectors) that detects or monitors the temperature of or
    around or surrounding analyte sensor 401. In certain embodiments, monitored or
    detected temperature data may be used to process the signals from analyte sensor 401
    to, for example, compensate for potential analyte sensor signal deviation (thus resulting
    in error) due to temperature change or variation.
[00139] Accordingly, in certain embodiments, analyte sensor 401 including sensing
    chemistry, an analyte flux-limiting membrane and/or other compositions, may be
    initially manufactured separately from the printed circuit board (PCB) 411 and other
    components of on body electronics 410, and electrically connected during the final
    stages of the manufacturing process to electrically connect the electrodes of the analyte
    sensor 401 to the respective electrical contact points on PCB 411. Use of interconnect
    component 510 in certain embodiments allows for the initial separate manufacturing of
    analyte sensor 401 and on body electronics 410, and thereafter, assembled or connected
    together to form an integrated assembly prior to use.
[00140] In certain embodiments, the conductive material for the interconnect component
    510 includes conductive traces embedded in a flexible material, such as a flexible strip,
    which generally can be formed from a thermoplastic material. Suitable thermoplastic
    materials may include polyimides such as for example, Kapton polymide film, but other
    suitable material may be used. In other embodiments, conductive traces are
    encapsulated in a flexible sheath.
[00141] FIG. 8A-8D illustrate on body electronics including a module interconnect in
    certain embodiments, with FIGS. 8A-8B illustrating top perspective views, while FIGS.
    8C-8D illustrating bottom perspective views. Referring to FIGS. 8A-8D, on body
    electronics 810 includes modular sensor assembly 802 which includes analyte sensor
    801 (see e.g., FIGS. 8C-8D), for engageably coupling with electronics component 806.
   As illustrated, the modular sensor assembly 802 may be configured to interlock or

                                                 -35
     otherwise engage with the electronics component 806. Accordingly, upon engagement
     of modular sensor assembly 802 and electronics component 806, on body electronics
     810 with analyte sensor 801 may be provided.
 [00142] In certain embodiments, modular sensor assembly 802 may be a molded device,
     such as for example, formed by injection molding techniques. As illustrated in FIG.
     8B, modular sensor assembly 802 includes bottom surface 805 connected to top surface
     807 by sidewall 803. As can be seen in the perspective views of FIGS. 8C and 8D, in
     certain embodiments, top surface 807 includes conductive material 814 disposed
     thereon. Further, top surface 807 may include a vertical surface extending downwardly,
     which may include conductive material 816 disposed thereon. In certain embodiments,
     conductive material 816 includes conductive traces and/or conductive contacts.
 [00143]    Still referring to the figures, on body electronics 810 in certain embodiments
     include modular sensor assembly 802 and electronics component 806 configured for a
     slidable engagement. As illustrated in FIG. 8B, the bottom of electronics component
     806 may include a surface configured to slidably receive modular sensor assembly 802.
    Further, in certain embodiments, top surface 807 of modular sensor assembly 802 may
    be configured to define a tongue to interlock with a corresponding groove 804 defined
    in electronics component 806 to define the shape of on body electronics 810.
 [00144] Electronics component 806 in certain embodiments may include one or more
    PCBs including conductive material 808 disposed thereon, such as one or more
    conductive traces and/or conductive contacts. During engagement of electronics
    component 806 with modular sensor assembly 802, the conductive material 808 can
    interface with interconnect conductive material 814. Thus, during engagement, the
    electronics component 806 and modular sensor assembly 802 establishes electrical
    communication.
[001451 As illustrated in FIG. 8C, modular sensor assembly 802 includes analyte sensor
    801 secured or otherwise coupled to a surface of the modular sensor assembly 802. For
    example, analyte sensor 801 may be coupled to the vertical surface extending from the
    top surface of the modular sensor assembly 802. In this manner, the vertical surface
    includes conductive material, such as conductive contacts 816 that connect with the one
    or more conductive contacts of analyte sensor 801 to establish an electrical
    communication between analyte sensor 801 and modular sensor assembly 802.
[00146] In certain embodiments, as best illustrated in FIGS. 8C and 8D, analyte sensor
    801 may be mounted to sidewall 803 of modular sensor assembly 802. In this

                                                -36
   embodiment, distal portion 801a of analyte sensor 801 is inserted perpendicular to the
   skin (not shown). In this regard, the bottom surface of the modular sensor assembly
   802 includes an aperture 820 (FIGS. 8C and 8D) to permit the distal portion 801a of
   analyte sensor 801 to extend from the bottom of on body electronics 810 such that
   distal portion 801a of analyte sensor 801 may be implanted into the body of a user
   when in use. In certain embodiments, modular sensor assembly 802 may also include a
   power source 812, such as a battery. Power source 812 may provide power via
   conductive traces 814 to the electronics component 806. In this manner, the electronics
   component 806 may be powered by power source 812 of modular sensor assembly 802
   such that the electronics component 806 does not need an internal power source.
[00147] The conductive material disposed on the modular sensor assembly 802 and/or the
   electronics component 806 and analyte sensor 801 may include conductive film, such as
   but not limited to, an anisotropic film. Conductive material, such as the conductive
   film and/or the Zebra style connector, can provide both a mechanical and electrical
   connection between modular sensor assembly 802 and sensor 801 or electronics
   component 806. Modular sensor assembly 802, analyte sensor 801, and electronics
   component 806 may also be bonded together utilizing an adhesive, such as a UV
   curable adhesive, or a multi-adhesive, such as a silver loaded epoxy can be used. Other
   adhesives can alternatively be employed.
[00148] FIGS. 9A-9J illustrate on body electronics including an analyte sensor and the
   PCB provided in the housing of the on body electronics in certain embodiments.
   Referring to the Figures, in certain embodiments, the analyte sensor 901 is electrically
   connected to the printed circuit board 911 during manufacturing of the on body patch
   assembly such that the position of the analyte sensor 901 is fixed relative to the printed
   circuit board 911 prior to and during use. For example, referring to FIGS. 9A and 9B,
   as shown, the analyte sensor 901 is electrically connected to the printed circuit board
   911 such that the respective contact pads 904 on the analyte sensor 901 are soldered, jet
   bonded, or otherwise electrically connected to the respective one of the contact points
   960 on the printed circuit board 911. In certain embodiments, printed circuit board 911
   may include a hole 915 for guiding and/or aligning insertion needle assembly 930 (FIG.
   9E) and the sensor distal portion 903.
[00149] In certain embodiments, as shown in FIG. 9C, conductive material 950 such as
   solder, gold, silver, silver filled epoxy, copper or other suitable material is separately
   provided on each of the contact pads 904 of analyte sensor 901 so as to establish

                                              -37
    electrical connection with the respective contact points 960 on PCB 911. A side cross
    sectional view of such connection is shown in FIGS. 9C and 9D where the analyte
    sensor 901 is permanently connected to PCB 911, for example, at a substantially 90
   degree angle relative to PCB 911 or at other suitable angles. In FIG. 9C-9D, it can be
   seen that wetted solder or conductive adhesive 950 is provided to establish permanent
   electrical connection between the contact pads 904 of the analyte sensor 901 and the
   respective contact points 960 on the printed circuit board 911. More specifically, FIG
   9D shows conductive material 950 after it has been applied and integrated with the
   contact point 960 on PCB 911, while FIG. 9C shows conductive material 950 applied
   on the contact point 960 on PCB 911 before it is integrated with it to form the electrical
   connection.
[00150] Referring still to the Figures, while the connection between analyte sensor 901
   and PCB 911 is shown and described as a 90 degree angle, in certain embodiments, the
   relative angle between the sensor 901 and printed circuit board 911 may vary and
   include one or more angles less than 90 degrees relative to each other, such as about 80
   degrees or less, about 70 degrees or less, about 60 degrees or less, about 50 degrees or
   less, about 45 degrees or less, about 40 degrees or less, about 30 degrees or less, or
   about 20 degrees or less. Furthermore, in certain embodiments, the attachment or
   connection of the analyte sensor 901 to the printed circuit board 911 may include
   conductive adhesive bonding, gold ball bonding, silver ball bonding, solder jet bonding,
   or other suitable equivalent bonding techniques.
[00151] Referring to FIGS. 9E-91, certain embodiments include a mounting bracket 910
   for retaining analyte sensor 901 in position relative to PCB 911 during manufacturing
   and/or use. More specifically, in certain embodiments, mounting bracket 910 includes
   a guide or a hole 905 for alignment of insertion needle 930 and distal portion 903 of
   analyte sensor 901 coupled with insertion needle 930 prior to and during the insertion
   of analyte sensor 901. Mounting bracket 910 may be further be configured to retain or
   assist in the withdrawal of insertion needle 930 after transcutaneous placement of
   analyte sensor 901 distal portion 903. As shown, FIGS. 9G-91 illustrate a top planar
  view, a side planar view and a bottom planar view, respectively, of mounting bracket
  910 in certain embodiments. Also shown is guide or hole 905 in mounting bracket 910
  discussed above for guiding and/or aligning insertion needle 930 and sensor distal
  portion 903.

                                              -38
[001521 Referring back to the Figures, FIG. 9E illustrates a component view of insertion
   needle 930, mounting bracket 910, analyte sensor 901, and PCB 911, while FIG. 9F
    illustrates an assembled view of insertion needle 930, mounting bracket 910, analyte
    sensor 901, and PCB 911. In certain embodiments, insertion needle 930 includes an
   opening along a longitudinal side for disengaging with analyte sensor 901 when on
   body electronics 902 is placed on the skin surface, with distal portion 903 of analyte
   sensor 901 positioned under the skin surface in fluid contact with ISF. Again, guide or
   hole 905 of mounting bracket 910 in certain embodiments guides or assists the
   withdrawal or retraction or insertion needle 930 after transcutaneous sensor placement.
   In certain embodiments, mounting bracket 910 may be fabricated using injection
   molding process or other suitable processes.
[001531 Referring still to the Figures, in certain embodiments, optional features such as
   support 990 for positioning and maintain analyte sensor 901 in the desired orientation
   or position relative to PCB 911 during on body electronics assembly is shown in FIG.
   9J. Also shown in FIG. 9J is insertion needle guide 980 having distal portion 903 of
   analyte sensor 901 provided therethrough. Support 990 may include additional
   protrusions, dimples or accents on its side facing the top surface of the PCB 911 to
   assist and/or guide the orientation of analyte sensor 901 during assembly of on body
   electronics 902.
[001541 In this manner, in certain embodiments, analyte sensor 901 may be permanently
   connected to PCB 911 of on body electronics such that the formed integrated assembly
   is used and discarded together based on the use of the analyte sensor.
[00155] FIGS. 1OA and 1OB illustrate a top planar view and a cross sectional view,
   respectively, of an antenna and electronic circuit layout of the on body electronics for
   use in the analyte monitoring system 100 of FIG. 1 in certain embodiments. More
   particularly, FIG. 10B is a cross sectional view along the dotted line B shown in FIG.
    1OA in certain embodiments. Referring to FIGS. 1OA and 1OB, antenna 1010 in certain
   embodiments includes a conductive material 1001, such as a PCB copper trace or the
   like, provided on a substrate 1002, and further, a plurality of inductors 1003a-1 003e
   disposed on the substrate 1002 and electrically connected to the conductive layer 1001
   in a loop configuration. In certain embodiments, inductors 1003a-1003e are spaced
   equidistantly from each other in the loop configuration.
[001561 In this embodiment, the loop is positioned substantially near the perimeter of the
   substrate, e.g., within about 50 mm or less, e.g., within about 40 mm or less, within

                                             -39
   about 30 mm or less, within about 20 mm or less, within about 10 mm or less, within
   about 5 mm or less, within about 3 mm or less, within about 1 mm or less. The looping
   and/or perimeter positioning further increases the area (or length) of the antenna,
   thereby increasing the transmission range of the antenna, for example. In certain
   embodiments, some or all of the inductors 1003a-1003e may not be spaced apart
   equidistant from each other. Also shown in FIGS. 1OA and 1OB is ASIC and/or
   microprocessor 1004 in electrical communication with the conductive layer 1001 for
   processing signals from an in vivo analyte sensor (not shown) and interfacing with the
   sensor in addition to processing the commands or signals from display device 120 (FIG.
   1) and generating and/or providing the response data packet to display device 120.
[001571 FIG. 11 illustrates a top planar view of an antenna layout on the circuit board of
   on body electronics in certain alternate embodiments. Referring to FIG. 11, compared
   to antenna 1010 of FIGS. 1OA and lOB, antenna 1110 of the on body electronics shown
   in FIG. 11 may be provided around only a portion or section of the outer periphery of
   PCB 1102, and radially wound substantially around the portion or section of the outer
   periphery of PCB 1102. For example, as shown in FIG. 11, the conductive trace
   forming the antenna 1110 may be provided in a looped, threaded manner such that the
   continuous trace is alternatingly provided on the top and the bottom surfaces of PCB
   1102 along the portion of its outer edge or periphery, and/or threaded through the PCB
   1102 repeatedly with each loop about the periphery of PCB 1102. In certain
   embodiments, such looping back and forth between the top and bottom surfaces of PCB
   1102 may be about most or all of the perimeter of PCB 1102.
[001581 In certain embodiments, antenna 1110 shown in FIG. 11 provides for lower
   manufacturing cost by reducing the antenna components and importantly may require
   less space on PCB 1102 which further enables miniaturization of an on body electronics
   unit. For example, configuration of antenna 1110 in the embodiment shown in FIG. 11
   obviates the need for separate inductors as compared to the antenna configuration
   shown in FIGS. 1OA and 1OB. As such, the diameter of the overall PCB 1102 may be
   reduced by about 10% or more, about 15% or more, about 20% or more, about 25% or
   more, or about 30% or more. Also shown in FIG. 11 is microprocessor and/or ASIC
   1104, in electrical communication with the antenna 1110 for processing signals from an
   in vivo analyte sensor (not shown) and interfacing with the sensor in addition to
   processing the commands or signals from display device 120 (FIG. 1) and generating
   and/or providing the response data packet to display device 120.

                                               -40
 [00159] In the manner described above and shown in conjunction with FIGS. 10A-1OB
    and 11, in certain embodiments, on body electronics antenna 1010, 1110 may be printed
    as an internal conductive layer of PCB surrounded by the ground plane on the top and
    bottom layers of PCB. That is, in one aspect, the top and bottom conductive layers may
    be separated by layers of one or more dielectrics and a conductive layer with a loop
    antenna disposed therebetween as shown in FIG. 11. Alternatively, antenna for on
    body electronics may be printed on the top substrate 1002 in series with a plurality of
    inductors 1003a-1003e as shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B. In certain embodiments of
    antenna with inductors, the number of inductors may range from about 2 to about 10,
    for example, about 3 to about 7, or about 5 in some embodiments.
[00160] FIGS. 12A-12C illustrate an antenna configuration for on body electronics 1210
    in certain embodiments. In particular, FIG. 12A illustrates an embodiment of on body
    electronics 1210 with adhesive layer 1220 which includes an antenna 1230, FIG. 12B
    illustrates a cross sectional view of on body electronics 1210 and adhesive layer 1220
    shown in FIG. 12A, and FIG. 12C illustrates an equivalent circuit diagram of the
   terminals and the capacitances from the antenna on the adhesive layer of FIG. 12B.
[001611 Referring to FIG. 12A, embodiments include on body electronics 1210 mounted
   to adhesive patch layer 1220 that includes an antenna 1230 on surface 1221 of adhesive
    layer 1220. On body electronics 1210 in certain embodiments includes data control and
    logic implemented in ASIC 1211 that is coupled to antenna 1212 for data
   communication. As shown in FIG. 12A, antenna 1212 of on body electronics 1210 in
   certain embodiments may include a loop antenna operatively coupled to ASIC 1211 on
   a PCB of the on body electronics 1210.
[001621 Referring back to FIG. 12A, antenna 1230 in certain embodiments includes
   copper, aluminum, or other suitable material, and may further include a single, double
   or multiple loop antenna disposed around a periphery of the adhesive layer 1220. As
   further shown, antenna 1230 in certain embodiments includes two terminals 1231, 1232
   which, in certain embodiments include capacitive terminals that may be formed of the
   same material as loop antenna 1230 such as copper or aluminum. As shown in FIG.
    12A, terminals 1231, 1232 of antenna 1230 are positioned on adhesive layer 1220 such
   that the terminals 1231, 1232 do not contact each other. Referring now to FIGS. 12A
   and 12B, on surface 1222 of adhesive layer 1220, terminal 1233 is provided with
   dielectric layer 1250 positioned between surface 1222 of adhesive layer 1220 and
   terminal 1233. Terminal 1233, in certain embodiments, includes a capacitive terminal

                                               -41
    that may be formed of the same material as terminals 1231, 1232. In other
    embodiments, terminal 1233 may be formed of different material than material used to
    form terminals 1231, 1232.
 [00163] Furthermore, as can be seen from the cross sectional view of FIG. 12B, terminal
     1233 is sized and positioned on surface 1222 of adhesive layer 1220 such that terminals
     1231, 1232 are positioned on surface 1221of adhesive layer 1220 within a surface area
    of the adhesive layer 1220 that includes the surface area on surface 1222 of the
    adhesive layer where terminal 1233 is positioned. In this manner, capacitance 1241 is
    formed between terminal 1231 and terminal 1233, and capacitance 1242 is formed
    between terminal 1231 and terminal 1233.
[00164] Referring again to FIG. 12B, in certain embodiments, dielectric layer 1250
    provided between terminal 1240 and surface 1222 of adhesive layer 1220 includes
    material with relatively high dielectric constant (for example, materials with dielectric
    constant of greater than about 90 or more) increases capacitances 1241, 1242 generated
    between terminal 1231 and terminal 1233, and between terminal 1222 and terminal
    1233, respectively. In this manner, capacitances 1241, 1242 in certain embodiments are
    used to control the inductance to tune antenna 1230 on adhesive layer 1220 to the same
    frequency of the antenna 1212 of on body electronics 1210. Tuning antenna 1230 to
    the same frequency as the frequency of antenna 1212 extends the transmission range of
    on body electronics 1210 for signal communication with display device and/or other
    components of the overall system 100 (FIG. 1). For example, by tuning antenna 1230
    on adhesive layer 1220 to the frequency of antenna 1212 of on body electronics 1210,
    the transmission range of on body electronics 1210 for signal communication with
    display device 120 (FIG. 1) or other components of the system 100 (FIG. 1) may be
    increased by about 25%, about 50%, about 100%, about 150% or about 200% of the
   transmission range using the antenna 1220 of on body electronics 1210 only.
[001651 In the manner described, in certain embodiments, additional single or multiple
    loop antenna disposed on an adhesive layer or other components separate from the PCB
   of on skin electronics extends data transmission range for signal communication
   without requiring additional antenna within the on skin electronics. Furthermore,
   capacitances 1241, 1242 in certain embodiments can be modified by using dielectric
   layer 1250 with a different dielectric constant provided between adhesive layer 1220
   and terminal 1222. In other embodiments, dielectric layer 1250 may be optional and

                                               -42
    not included between adhesive layer 1220 and terminal 1233 to achieve the desired
    capacitance 1241, 1242.
 [00166] FIG. 13 is an exemplary schematic of an on body electronics including an in vivo
    analyte sensor and sensor electronics component for use in the analyte monitoring
    system 100 of FIG. 1 in certain embodiments. As shown in FIG. 13, on body
    electronics 1300 of the analyte monitoring system 100, in certain embodiments includes
    a loop antenna 1320 for transmitting the analyte related data to the display device 120
    (or other component or device in the system 100 (FIG. 1)). Inductive power loop
    antenna 1360 for processing the RF power from display device 120 is provided, which
    in certain embodiment converts the RF power from display device 120 (FIG. 1) to
    corresponding DC power for the operation of the on body electronics 1300. In this
    manner, in certain embodiments, on body electronics 1300 may be configured to
    operate as a passive data communication component, adopting inductive coupling
    power without a separate power supply or battery for data transmission.
[00167] Furthermore, on body electronics 1300 in certain embodiments does not require a
    mechanism to initialize the device to place it in its operational mode (turn on the
    device) nor to deactivate or turn off (or power down) on body electronics 1300. That is,
    on body electronics 1300 may be initialized and enters an active or operational mode
    when it detects the RF power from a display device. After initialization, on body
    electronics 1300, in certain embodiments, upon detection of radiated RF power from a
    display device, data communication components of on body electronics 1300 enters an
    active communication mode to transmit and/or receive data packets or otherwise
   communication with a display device.
[00168] Referring back to FIG, 13, also provided is a plurality of super capacitors Cl, C2
   coupled to inductive power loop antenna 1360 and controller 1310. Referring still to
   FIG. 13, controller 1310 may be provided on a PCB assembly including the loop
   antenna 1320, thermister is provided (not shown), analyte sensor contacts for coupling
   to the electrodes of an analyte sensor, one or more storage devices such as non-volatile
   memory (not shown), and other discrete components. In certain aspects, the PCB
   assembly may be partially or fully encapsulated with, for example, potting material for
   protection from moisture and/or contaminants.
[00169] FIG. 14 illustrates an embodiment of an input circuit for connection between an
   in vivo analyte sensor and on body electronics. Referring to FIG. 14, in certain
   embodiments, sensor 101 may also function as an electrolytic current source, and its

                                                 -43
     output coupled with a resistor 1402. Voltage developed across resistor 1402 can be
     measured, to provide a value indicative of analyte concentration. In certain
     embodiments, while sensor 1401 may function as the electrolytic current source, and
     thus configured to generate a signal that is correlated with the monitored analyte level
     without a separate power supply, the on body electronics coupled to sensor 1401 may
     include a power supply to provide power to operate the components of the on body
     electronics. For example, the power supply provided on the on body electronics may be
    used to provide power to the microprocessor and/or ASIC of the on body electronics to
     convert and/or filter and/or smooth and/or clip and/or average and/or correct and/or
     otherwise process the signals received from sensor 1401 and/or to store data associated
    with the signals from sensor 1401.
 [001701 In addition, capacitor 1403 may be provided in parallel or series with resistor
     1402, such that the signal from analyte sensor 1401 may be smoothed. The
    instantaneous reading from the sensor assembly may provide a time-averaged signal, or
    alternatively, a series of resistor-capacitor elements could be coupled to provide
    readings indicative of a time trend. In such embodiments, separate power supply to
    power the sensor 1401 is not necessary. In such embodiments, on body electronics 110
    may not include a separate power supply and rather, include a self-powered sensor as
    described in further detail in U.S. Patent Application No. 12/393,921, 61/325,260, and
    61/247,519 incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.
[001711 In certain embodiments, passive electronic (analog) components may be used to
    generate average and/or trend data. For example, by adding a capacitor (such as
    capacitor 1403) in parallel to current-measuring resistor 1402, the resulting measured
    voltage signal is a smoother signal than the original signal without the capacitor.
    Spikes, discontinuities and other rapid changes in the signal are removed or slowed
    down by the capacitor.
[00172]     The averaging process in certain embodiments may generate a time shift (delay)
    in the measured signal, and circuits may be provided to derive information related to the
    monitored analyte level from such delays.
[00173] One type of passive circuit that may be employed to generate signals indicative
   of data trends over time comprises network of a plurality of parallel resistor-capacitor
   pairs connected in series, wherein the current provided by the analyte sensor is directed
   through the two ends of the network and the respective smoothed and time-shifted
   signal measurements are taken across each resistor-capacitor pair.

                                                -44
[00174] FIG. 14B illustrates such a network, comprising two resistor-capacitor pairs,
   resistor 1421 in parallel with capacitor 1422, and resistor 1423 in parallel with capacitor
    1424, with the two resistor-capacitor pairs connected in a series connection between
   working electrode 1425 and counter electrode 1426. Measurement points for voltages
    1427 and 1428, indicative of analyte concentration, are disposed respectively across
   each of the two parallel resistor-capacitor pairs. In this network, the two resistors 1421
   and 1423 are both of approximately equal resistance, in this embodiment,
   approximately 5 Megaohms (the exact resistance of the resistors may not be critical, as
   long as it is sufficiently high to limit current flow). In certain embodiments, resistance
   may be maintained approximately equal between the resistors to equivalently scale the
   respective voltage measurements.
[001751 To achieve the desired delay, in certain embodiments, the capacitance of
   capacitor 1422 is greater than the capacitance of capacitor 1424. In this embodiment,
   the measured voltages 1427 and 1428, provide two analyte measurement signals with
   different time delays. If the signal is increasing, the more averaged signal 1427 will be
   lower than the less averaged signal 1428. When the signal is decreasing the situation is
   reversed. This information is generated passively, powered by the electricity generated
   by analyte sensor 1401 (FIG. 14A). In this manner both quantitative analyte
   measurements, and the measurement trend data can be obtained.
[001761 FIG. 14C shows an electronic circuit in which sensor 1401 (FIG. 14A) has a
   working electrode 1435, and two counter electrodes 1436 and 1437, with signal current
   split between the two counter electrodes, in certain embodiments. Working electrode
    1435 is connected to the circuit between the respective resistor-capacitor parallel pairs
   resistor 1431 and capacitor 1432, and resistor 1433 and capacitor 1434, and the counter
   electrodes 1436 and 1437 are connected to the respective ends of the network. Again,
   the resistors are each approximately 5 Megaohms and capacitor 1432 has higher
   capacitance than capacitor 1434. In this manner, two voltage signals 1439 and 1438
   across capacitor 1432 and capacitor 1434, respectively are generated, one signal with a
   larger delay compared to the other. The capacitors 1432 and 1434 again determine the
   delays corresponding to the two arms of the circuit.
[00177] A higher resolution of the analyte level trend especially during periods were the
   analyte level trend is changing (peaks and valleys) may be achieved by using a greater
   number of parallel resistor-capacitor elements in series and measuring the potential
   drop at each of the elements simultaneously. This is illustrated in FIG. 14D, which

                                              -45
   shows measurements taken across three series resistor-capacitor pairs between working
   electrode 1447 and counter electrode 1448. In this embodiment, capacitor 1442 has
   higher capacitance than capacitor 1444, which has higher capacitance than capacitor
   1446, and the three resistors 1441, 1443 and 1445, are of approximately equal
   resistance, of about 5 megaohms. In this manner three voltage signals 1451, 1452, and
   1453 across capacitor 1442, capacitor 1444, and capacitor 1446, respectively are
   generated, each voltage signal 1451, 1452, 1453 with a different delay compared to
   each other. In certain embodiments, the size of the capacitance of capacitors 1442,
   1444, and 1446 determines the delays corresponding to the arms of the circuit.
[00178] Referring now to FIG. 14E, shown is an alternative circuit to the ones depicted in
   FIGS. 14B-14D. As shown, this circuit allows any value of resistor-capacitor pair
   1463/1464 to be chosen without any effect on the scale factor of the sensor with work
   electrode 1465 and counter electrode 1466. In this embodiment, resistor 1463 x
   capacitor 1464 is greater than capacitor 1462 x resistor 1461 and resistor 1461 is
   approximately 5 Megaohms. The voltages 1467 and 1468 are referenced to the
   transmitter signal ground and measure the un-lagged sensor output on voltage 1467 and
   the time lagged output on voltage 1468. These two voltages are measured by a circuit
   that has a very high input impedance. For example, it may be reasonable to achieve 10
   Gigaohms input impedance in ASIC 1510 (FIG. 15). Consequently there may be no
   electrical "loading" effects on the signal. Any value of resistor 1463 may be selected
   allowing a small value of capacitor 1464 that is physically smaller and less expensive.
   Similar to the parallel resistor-capacitor circuit described in FIG. 14D, additional time
   delayed signals may be obtained with the addition of more segments of resistors and
   capacitors similar to resistor-capacitor pair 1463/1464.
[001791 Delay and smoothing circuits such as those shown in FIGS. 14B-14E may be
   incorporated in an embodiment such as sensor assembly 1500 (FIG. 15) by providing
   additional inputs to ASIC 1510 (FIG. 15) or corresponding electronics. The signals
   provided may be selectively accessed through the ASIC for use in interfaced devices
   including on-demand devices, periodic reading devices, and data loggers, as required by
   the reading or logging application. The respective measurements can be appropriately
   coded into the RF transmission stream from sensor assembly 1500, and decoded and
   used as needed for the functions performed by the particular interfaced device.
[00180] If ASIC 1510 (FIG. 15) is part of the sensor, then ASIC 1510 can be
   programmed with a unique ID number. If ASIC 1510 is separate from the sensor, then

                                                -46
    it may be feasible to add a unique resistor to the sensor that would allow identification
    of the sensor. For example, the resistor could be a laser trimmed resistance in a range of
    values, with around 50 different values. ASIC 1510 could be made to read that
    resistance so that if a user attempted to re-use the same sensor the system software
    would recognize a re-use occurrence.
 [001811 FIG. 15 is a block diagram of the components of on body electronics in certain
    embodiments. More specifically, on body electronics 1500 in certain embodiments
    does not include a dedicated power supply and is configured to provide analyte
    concentration data in processed digital format. In such embodiments, the data
    processing functionality of on body electronics 1500 may include analog to digital
    converter (ADC) 1521 and digital signal processor (DSP) 1512. ADC 1521 and DSP
    1512 may be integrated with one or more oscillators 1514, modulator 1513, and RF
    amplifier 1515 for data communication to display device 120 (FIG. 1) or other data
    processing devices such as, for example, the data processing module 160 and/or remote
    terminal 170. In certain embodiments, this integration may be in the form of a
    monolithic integrated circuit, such as an ASIC 1510.
[00182] In one embodiment, ASIC 1510 includes at least four terminals, including at least
    two terminals 1505a, 1505b for the input from analyte sensor 1501 and two terminals
    1506c, 1506d for connection to antenna 1520 (shown in FIG. 15 as a loop antenna),
    which may also serve as a power input for ASIC 1510. ASIC 15 10 may also provide
    additional functions, such as data encryption, data compression, providing or
    communicating a serial number, time stamp and temperature readings, operating logic,
    and other functions, in addition to digitizing and transmitting data packets and/or
    signals corresponding to measured analyte levels.
[001831 Antenna 1520 may be inductively coupled, including for example by RF
    coupling in a manner similar to that used in passive RFID designs as discussed herein.
   Antenna 1520, when functioning as a passive RF or inductive pickup, may be
   configured to provide power to ASIC 1510, for example, powering it long enough to
   take a sensor reading, digitizing it, and communicating the reading through the same
   antenna 1520, or otherwise for as long or short a period as may be required by the
   particular application. While in many embodiments, battery-less operation of the
   sensor assembly will be an important feature, in other embodiments a battery (including
   one or more cells) could be provided within on body electronics 1500 to supplement the
   power provided through antenna 1520.

                                              -47
 [001841 In certain embodiments, the on body electronics may include a power supply
    such as a battery (for example, encapsulated with the electronic components and/or the
    sensor with a suitable potting material within the housing). The power supply in such
    embodiments is configured to provide power to the electronic components on in the
    housing in addition to providing power the sensor. Furthermore, in certain
    embodiments, the power supply of the on body electronics is not used or configured to
    power the data communication between the on body electronics with other devices of
    the analyte monitoring system.
 [001851 FIG. 16 is a block diagram of the on body electronics in certain embodiments.
    Referring to FIG. 16, on body electronics 1600 in certain embodiments includes a
    control unit 1610 (such as, for example but not limited to, one or more microprocessors,
    and/or ASICs), operatively coupled to analog front end circuitry 1670 to process signals
    such as raw current signals received from analyte sensor 101. Also shown in FIG. 16 is
    memory 1620 operatively coupled to control unit 1610 for storing data and/or software
    routines for execution by control unit 1610. Memory 1620 in certain embodiment may
    include electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), erasable
    programmable read only memory (EPROM), random access memory (RAM), read only
    memory (ROM), flash memory, or one or more combinations thereof.
[001861 In certain embodiments, control unit 1610 accesses data or software routines
    stored in the memory 1620 to update, store or replace stored data or information in the
    memory 1620, in addition to retrieving one or more stored software routines for
    execution. Also shown in FIG. 16 is power supply 1660 which, in certain
    embodiments, provides power to some or all of the components of on body electronics
    1600. For example, in certain embodiments, power supply 1660 is configured to
    provide power to the components of on body electronics 1600 except for
    communication module 1640. In such embodiments, on body electronics 1600 is
    configured to operate analyte sensor 101 to detect and monitor the analyte level at a
   predetermined or programmed (or programmable) time intervals, and storing, for
    example, the signals or data corresponding to the detected analyte levels.
[00187]          In certain embodiments, power supply 1660 in on body electronics 1600
   may be toggled between its internal power source (e.g., a battery) and the RF power
   received from display device 120. For example, in certain embodiments, on body
   electronics 1600 may include a diode or a switch that is provided in the internal power
   source connection path in on body electronics 1600 such that, when a predetermined

                                               -48
   level of RF power is detected by on body electronics 1600, the diode or switch is
   triggered to disable the internal power source connection (e.g., making an open circuit
   at the power source connection path), and the components of on body electronics is
   powered with the received RF power. The open circuit at the power source connection
   path prevents the internal power source from draining or dissipating as in the case when
   it is used to power on body electronics 1600.
[00188] When the RF power from display device 120 falls below the predetermined level,
   the diode or switch is triggered to establish the connection between the internal power
   source and the other components of on body electronics 1600 to power the on body
   electronics 1600 with the internal power source. In this manner, in certain
   embodiments, toggling between the internal power source and the RF power from
   display device 120 may be configured to prolong or extend the useful life of the internal
   power source.
[001891 The stored analyte related data, however, is not transmitted or otherwise
   communicated to another device such as display device 120 (FIG. 1) until
   communication module 1640 is separately powered, for example, with the RF power
   from display device 120 that is positioned within a predetermined distance from on
   body electronics 1600. In such embodiments, analyte level is sampled based on the
   predetermined or programmed time intervals as discussed above, and stored in memory
   1620. When analyte level information is requested, for example, based on a request or
   transmit command received from another device such as display device 120 (FIG. 1),
   using the RF power from the display device, communication module 1640 of on body
   electronics 1600 initiates data transfer to the display device 120.
[001901 Referring back to FIG. 16, an optional output unit 1650 is provided to on body
   electronics 1600. In certain embodiments, output unit 1650 may include an LED
   indicator, for example, to alert the user of one or more predetermined conditions
   associated with the operation of the on body electronics 1600 and/or the determined
   analyte level. For example, in one aspect, on body electronics 1600 may be
   programmed or configured to provide a visual indication to notify the user of one or
   more predetermined operational conditions of on body electronics 1600. The one or
   more predetermined operational conditions may be configured by the user or the
   healthcare provider, so that certain conditions are associated with an output indication
   of on body electronics 1600.

                                              -49
[001911 By way of nonlimiting example, the on body electronics 1600 may be
   programmed to assert a notification using an LED indicator, or other indicator on the on
   body electronics 1600 when signals (based on one sampled sensor data point, or
   multiple sensor data points) received from analyte sensor 101 are indicated to be
   beyond a programmed acceptable range, potentially indicating a health risk condition
   such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, or the onset or potential of such conditions.
   With such prompt or indication, the user may be timely informed of such potential
   condition, and using display device 120, acquire the glucose level information from the
   on body electronics 1600 to confirm the presence of such conditions so that timely
   corrective actions may be taken.
[001921 As discussed, output unit 1650 of on body electronics 1600 may optionally
   include one or more output components such as a speaker, a tactile indicator such as a
   vibration module, a visual indicator (for example, an LED or OLED indicator), or the
   like to provide one or more indications associated with its functions such as upon
   providing the analyte related data to display device 120, alarm conditions associated
   with its internal components, detection of the RF power received from the display
   device 120, for example. By way of a non-limiting example, one or more exemplary
   output indication may include an audible sound (including for example, a short tone, a
   changing tone, multi-tone, one or more programmed ringtones or one or more
   combinations thereof), a visual indication such as a blinking light of an LED or OLED
   indicator, a solid light on the LED or OLED indicator maintained at a predetermined or
   programmed or programmable time period (for example, about 3 seconds, about 5
   seconds, about 7 seconds, about 10 seconds or more), each of which may be pre
   programmed in the on body electronics 1600 and/or programmable by the user through
   the user interface of display device 120 when in communication with on body
   electronics 1600.
[001931 For example, different levels of audible tones may be associated (programmed by
   the user, or pre-programmed in on body electronics 1600) with different conditions
   such that when asserted, each outputted tone may be easily recognized by the user as an
   indication of the particular associated condition. That is, the detected onset of
   hyperglycemic condition based on the signal from the analyte sensor may be associated
   with a first predetermined loudness and/or tone, while the detected onset of
   hypoglycemic condition based on the signal from the analyte sensor 101 may be
   associated with a second predetermined loudness and/or tone. Alternatively, the

                                              -50
   programmed or programmable audible alerts may include one or more sequence of
   audible outputs that are output based on a temporally spaced sequence or a sequence
   indicating an increase or decrease in the level of loudness (using the same tone, or
   gradually increasing/decreasing tones).
[001941 Furthermore, in aspects of the present disclosure the audible output indication
   may be asserted in conjunction with the visual output indicator, simultaneously or
   alternating, as may be customized or programmable in the on body electronics 1600 or
   pre-programmed.
[00195] Referring again to FIG. 16, antenna 1630 and communication module 1640
   operatively coupled to the control unit 1610 may be configured to detect and process
   the RF power when on body electronics 1600 is positioned within predetermined
   proximity to the display device 120 (FIG. 1) that is providing or radiating the RF
   power. Further, on body electronics 1600 may provide analyte level information and
   optionally analyte trend or historical information based on stored analyte level data, to
   display device 120. In certain aspects, the trend information may include a plurality of
   analyte level information over a predetermined time period that are stored in the
   memory 1620 of the on body electronics 1600 and provided to the display device 120
   with the real time analyte level information. For example, the trend information may
   include a series of time spaced analyte level data for the time period since the last
   transmission of the analyte level information to the display device 120. Alternatively,
   the trend information may include analyte level data for the prior 30 minutes or one
   hour that are stored in memory 1620 and retrieved under the control of the control unit
   1610 for transmission to the display device 120.
[001961 In certain embodiments, on body electronics 1600 is configured to store analyte
   level data in first and second FIFO buffers that are part of memory 1620. The first
   FIFO buffer stores 16 (or 10 or 20) of the most recent analyte level data spaced one
   minute apart. The second FIFO buffer stores the most recent 8 hours (or 10 hours or 3
   hours) of analyte level data spaced 10 minutes (or 15 minutes or 20 minutes). The
   stored analyte level data are transmitted from on body electronics 1600 to display unit
   120 in response to a request received from display unit 120. Display unit 120 uses the
   analyte level data from the first FIFO buffer to estimate glucose rate-of-change and
   analyte level data from the second FIFO buffer to determine historical plots or trend
   information.

                                              -51
[00197] In certain embodiments, for configurations of the on body electronics that
   includes a power supply, the on body electronics may be configured to detect an RF
   control command (ping signal) from the display device 120. More specifically, an
   On/Off Key (OOK) detector may be provided in the on body electronics which is
   turned on and powered by the power supply of the on body electronics to detect the RF
   control command or the ping signal from the display device 120. Additional details of
   the OOK detector are provided in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0278333, the
   disclosure of which is incorporated by reference for all purposes. In certain aspects,
   when the RF control command is detected, on body electronics determines what
   response packet is necessary, and generates the response packet for transmission back
   to the display device 120. In this embodiment, the analyte sensor 101 continuously
   receives power from the power supply or the battery of the on body electronics and
   operates to monitor the analyte level continuously in use. However, the sampled signal
   from the analyte sensor 101 may not be provided to the display device 120 until the on
   body electronics receives the RF power (from the display device 120) to initiate the
   transmission of the data to the display device 120. In one embodiment, the power
   supply of the on body electronics may include a rechargeable battery which charges
   when the on body electronics receives the RF power (from the display device 120, for
   example).
[00198] Referring back to FIG. 1, in certain embodiments, on body electronics 110 and
   the display device 120 may be configured to communicate using REID (radio frequency
   identification) protocols. More particularly, in certain embodiments, the display device
    120 is configured to interrogate the on body electronics 110 (associated with an RFID
   tag) over an RF communication link, and in response to the RF interrogation signal
   from the display device 120, on body electronics 110 provides an RF response signal
   including, for example, data associated with the sampled analyte level from the sensor
   101. Additional information regarding the operation of REID communication can be
   found in U.S. Patent No. 7,545,272, and in US Application Nos. 12/698,124,
   12/699,653, 12/761,387, and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009/0108992 the disclosure
   of which are incorporated herein by reference.
[001991 For example, in one embodiment, the display device 120 may include a
   backscatter RFID reader configured to provide an RF field such that when on body
   electronics 110 is within the transmitted RF field of the RFID reader, on body
   electronics 110 antenna is tuned and in turn provides a reflected or response signal (for

                                                 -52
      example, a backscatter signal) to the display device 120. The reflected or response
      signal may include sampled analyte level data from the analyte sensor 101.
  [00200] In certain embodiments, when display device 120 is positioned in within a
      predetermined range of the on body electronics 110 and receives the response signal
      from the on body electronics 110, the display device 120 is configured to output an
      indication (audible, visual or otherwise) to confirm the analyte level measurement
      acquisition. That is, during the course of the 5 to 10 days of wearing the on body
      electronics 110, the user may at any time position the display device 120 within a
     predetermined distance (for example, about 1-5 inches, or about 1-10 inches, or about
      1-12 inches) from on body electronics 110, and after waiting a few seconds of sample
     acquisition time period, an audible indication is output confirming the receipt of the real
     time analyte level information. The received analyte information may be output to the
     display 122 (FIG. 1) of the display device 120 for presentation to the user.
 [002011 In some embodiments, a small linear induction generator, powered by body
     movement, may be built into on body electronics 120 of FIG. 1. The induction
     generator can serve to replace or supplement a battery, or other power source, or RF
     power configuration of on body electronics 110. As schematically shown in FIG. 17, a
     generator may include magnet 1701, which is movable relative to conductor 1702.
     Magnet 1701 may be a strong magnet, such as a rare earth magnet, and conductor 1702
     may be a solenoid 1707 comprising a predetermined number of turns or winding of
     copper wire, within which magnet 1701 is axially slidable back and forth or up and
     down with respect to the solenoid windings. The movement of the magnet 1701 may
     be responsive to movement of the on body electronics 110 (FIG. 1) as may occur during
     normal daily activity of the user with the on body electronics 110 in place during use.
[002021 In certain embodiments, dimensions for the induction charging component may
    not be critical. The solenoid (tube) can be about 5mm in diameter and 20mm in length
     or smaller. Ranges for magnet sizes may range from about 3mm in diameter and 3mm
    in length, to micro sizes depending on the distance available for travel and the amount
    of current and/or charge desired. Wire diameter can be from about 0.003mm to about
    0.007mm. To cap the ends, a rubber stopper or snap on lid with a bumper can be used.
    Alternatively, the cap features can be part of the transmitter casing.
[002031 Movement of magnet 1701 relative to conductor 1702 generates electromotive
    forces (EMF) in conductor 1702 responsive to magnetic flux changes relative to the
    surface of conductor 1702. The EMF polarity may fluctuate according to the direction

                                               -53
    in which the magnet 1701 is moving (although a single-polarity embodiment may be
    achieved where magnet 1701 moves past conductor 1702 in one direction on a circular
    track). In certain embodiments, such as linear embodiments with back-and-forth
    magnet movement, in which electricity of changing polarity is generated, rectifier
    circuit 1703 (which may be a bridge rectifier) may be interposed, and the output from
    the rectifier 1703 may be stored in storage unit 1708. An additional diode 1709 may be
    placed in the charging circuit to prevent passive discharge through conductor 1702
    when the device is not actively charging. Storage device 1708 for the electrical output
    of the generator may be a capacitor 1704 and/or diode 1705, or alternately in a
    mechanical energy storage device such as a flywheel or a spring. Capacitor 1704 may
    be a supercapacitor, preferably of high quality (high internal resistance, low leakage).
    Capacitor 1704 (or other storage device) may be used as the sole power source for the
    on body device, or to supplement battery power. Used as a supplement to a battery,
    such a generator can extend battery life and/or permit the use of high power
   consumption functions for the on body electronics 110 (FIG. 1).
[00204] In certain embodiments, on body electronics 110 includes an ASIC that includes
   on chip a RISC (reduced instruction set computing) processor, an EEPROM, and a
   register (A/D converter operatively coupled to an analyte sensor). EEPROM in certain
   embodiments includes a portion that has programmed in it one or more characteristics
   or details associated with a memory management routine. Exemplary characteristics or
   details include, for example, a source address (e.g., whether it is an array or a single
   memory location), a destination address, a size/number of bytes to copy to memory,
   whether the memory location is a loop buffer (e.g., overwriting the older stored values
   with new values when the end of the buffer is reached).
[00205] In certain embodiments, a preset number of specific events may be fined and
   stored. For example, such events may include, but not limited to (1) RF power on
   event, (2) RF data read command; (3) RF data log command, (4) 1 minute data ready
   event (e.g., the A/D conversion of the signal from the analyte sensor is complete and
   the digitized data is ready for storage), or (3) log data (10 minute analyte data) ready
   event (e.g., when 10 minutes of analyte data is available for storage). For example, 10
   minutes of analyte data is available in certain embodiments when the last A/D
   conversion for the 10 minute analyte data is complete. In certain embodiments, other
   events or states may be defined.

                                                 -54
 [00206] In certain embodiments, when the RISC processor detects one of the specific
     events, the RISC processor executes the programmed the memory management routine.
     During the execution of the memory management routine, the stored characteristics in
     EEPROM are retrieved. Based on the retrieved characteristics, the memory
    management routine stores data associated with the detected event. For example, in
    certain embodiments, when a RF data log command event is detected, the data
    associated with this event is logged in another section of the EEPROM on ASIC chip in
    accordance with the retrieved characteristics (e.g., source and destination address for
    the data associated with this event).
 [00207] In certain embodiments, the characteristics stored in EEPROM associated with
    the specific events may be modified. For example, the source and destination address
    may be changed or modified to point to a different memory device or storage unit of on
    body electronics 110 (e.g., a separate EEPROM or memory that is not part of the ASIC
    chip). For example, data logger applications of the monitoring system 100 requires
    storing an amount of data (e.g., data for about 30 days, about 45 days, about 60 days or
    more, of 1 minute interval sampled analyte data (or 5 minute interval sampled data, or
     10 minute interval sampled data)) in on body electronics 110 much greater than in on
    demand application where a limited amount of data is stored (e.g., 15 samples of 1
    minute interval sampled analyte data, and 6 hours of historical 10 minute interval
    sampled analyte data). In certain embodiment, the amount of data for storage in data
    logger application may exceed the capacity of on chip EEPROM. In such cases, a
    larger capacity, off chip EEPROM may be provided in on body electronics 110 for
    storing data from the data logger application. To configure on body electronics 110 to
    store sampled analyte data in the larger capacity, off chip EEPROM, in certain
    embodiments, the characteristics stored in EEPROM associated with the events are
    reprogrammed or updated (for example, by updating the source and destination
    addresses associated with the events) so that data logging or storage is pointed to the
    larger off chip EEPROM.
[00208]     In this manner, by updating or reprogramming the portion of on chip EEPROM
    that stores the event characteristics, location of data storage in on body electronics 110
    may be updated or modified depending upon the desired application or use of on body
    electronics 110. Furthermore, other stored characteristics associated with one or more
   particular events may be updated or reprogrammed in EEPROM as desired to modify
   the use or application of on body electronics 110 in analyte monitoring system 100.

                                              -55
   This is further advantageously achieved without reprogramming or modifying the
   stored routines for executing the particular events by the RISC processor.
Embodiments of On Body Electronics Initialization/Pairing
[00209] Prior to initialization of the on body electronics 110 (FIG. 1) for use, there may
   be a period of time post manufacturing during which on body electronics 110 may be
   placed in sleep or idle mode. To initialize on body electronics 110 to transition from
   the sleep or idle mode, in certain embodiments, wireless signal may be provided to on
   body electronics 110 which, upon receipt by on body electronics 110 initiates an
   initialization routine to turn on body electronics 110 into operational mode for example,
   but turning on it power source.
[002101 FIGS. 18A- 18B illustrates a block diagram and circuit schematic, respectively of
   wireless turn on mechanism to initialize on body electronics 110 (FIG. 1) in certain
   embodiments. Referring to FIGS. 16 and 18A, in certain embodiments, communication
   module 1640 (FIG. 16) includes electronic switching mechanism for turning on or
   initializing on body electronics 110 (FIG. 1). More particularly, in certain
   embodiments, communication module 1640 (FIG. 16) includes a complimentary
   MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) 1810 arranged in
   combination with the battery or power supply 1870 and gate latching component 1830,
   which are connected to the load (or the main circuitry of the on body electronics 110
   (FIG. 1). In certain embodiments, power supply 1870 may be a separate power supply,
   or the power supply 1660 (FIG. 16) of on body electronics 110.
[002111 Referring back to FIG. 18A, also shown is antenna 1860 for receiving RF
   signals. Antenna 1860 may be coupled to matching circuit 1850 and RF carrier rectifier
   1840 which is coupled to complimentary MOSFET 1810. An exemplary equivalent
   circuit schematic for the wireless turn on mechanism shown in FIG. 18A is illustrated
   in FIG. 18B.
[002121 Referring to FIGS. 18A-18B, in certain embodiments, when an RF signal is
   received, for example, from display device 120 (FIG. 1) via the antenna 1860, the
   received RF signal momentarily biases the gate of the N channel MOSFET M2 through
   diode Dl which rectifies the received RF signal. Capacitor C1 and inductors LI and L2
   form the matching circuit 1850 (FIG. 18A). Matching circuit 1850 is configured to
   match the impedance between the antenna 1860 and diode D1. When the N-channel
   MOSFET M2 is biased, the drain pin of the P-channel MOSFET M1 is biased. When

                                              -56
   the N-channel MOSFET M2 is biased, the battery or power source 1870 is coupled to
   the load or the main circuitry 1820 of the on body electronics 110 (FIG. 1). With this
   connection from the battery 1870 to diode D2, diode D2 biases the N-channel MOSFET
   M2, and the resulting connection maintains the connection from the battery 1870 to the
   load 1820 as diode D2 will latch the gate of the N-channel MOSFET M2 even after the
   received RF signal has dissipated. In this manner, in certain embodiments,
   communication module 1640 (FIG. 16) of on body electronics 110 (FIG. 1) includes an
   RF signal based turn on mechanism to initialize on body electronics 110 from the post
   manufacturing shelf mode. In certain embodiments, display device 120 (FIG. 1)
   wirelessly transmits the RF turn on signal to on body electronics 110 in response to the
   user activation or actuation of a command or a signal transmission.
[00213] In certain embodiments, the initial positioning and/or maintaining (for a given
   time period such as about 3-5 seconds, for example) of the display device 120 within a
   predetermined distance from the on body electronics 110 (after placement on the skin
   surface) may automatically initiate the transmission of the RF turn on signal to the on
   body electronics 110 for initialization. In certain embodiments, the RF turn on signal
   may include one of a plurality of predetermined OOK (On-Off Key) signals.
[00214] During post manufacturing shelf mode, on body electronics 110 draws little or no
   current from the power supply or battery. The internal processing component (such as
   for example, microprocessor or programmed logic) and the oscillators are in inactive
   state. RF envelope detector of on body electronics 110 may be configured to be
   triggered only upon detection of an RF signal from, for example, display device 120
   that is positioned within a predetermined distance or data communication range to on
   body electronics 110 (for initialization) such as within one inch or less, within 3 inches
   or less, within 5 inches or less, for example.
[002151 Alternatively, the on body electronics 110 may be provided or packaged within
   an RF shielding bag such as a foil pouch. When the RF signal is detected by the
   envelope detector of on body electronics 110, the output of the envelope detector is
   configured to control an electronic switch such as a field effect transistor (FET) that,
   when triggered, applies power or draws power signals from the internal power source
   such as a battery and the processing component is temporarily latched on.
[002161 Referring now to FIG. 19 which illustrates data and/or commands exchange
   between on body electronics 110 and display device 120 during the initialization and
   pairing routine, display device 120 provides and initial signal 1921 to on body

                                               -57
   electronics 110. When the received initial signal 1921 includes RF energy exceeding a
   predetermined threshold level 1903, an envelope detector of on body electronics 110 is
   triggered 1904, one or more oscillators of on body electronics 110 turns on, and control
   logic or microprocessors of on body electronics 110 is temporarily latched on to
   retrieve and execute one or more software routines to extract the data stream from the
   envelope detector 1904. If the data stream from the envelope detector returns a valid
   query 2405, a reply signal 1922 is transmitted to display device 120. The reply signal
   1922 from on body electronics 110 includes an identification code such as on body
   electronics 110 serial number. Thereafter, the on body electronics 110 returns to shelf
   mode in an inactive state.
[002171 On the other hand, if the data stream from the envelope detector does not return a
   valid query from display device 120, on body electronics 110 does not transmit a reply
   signal to display device 120 nor is on body electronics 110 serial number provided to
   display device 120. Thereafter, on body electronics 110 returns to shelf mode 1903,
   and remains in powered down state until it detects a subsequent initial signal 1921 from
   display device 120.
[00218] When display device 120 receives the data packet including identification
   information or serial number from on body electronics 110, it extracts that information
   from the data packet 1912. With the extracted on body electronics 110 serial number,
   display device 120 determines whether on body electronics 110 associated with the
   received serial number is configured. If on body electronics 110 associated with the
   received serial number has already been configured, for example, by another display
   device, display device 120 returns to the beginning of the routine to transmit another
   initial signal 1911 in an attempt to initialize another on body electronics that has not
   been configured yet. In this manner, in certain embodiments, display device 120 is
   configured to pair with an on body electronics that has not already been paired with or
   configured by another display device.
[00219] Referring back to FIG. 19, if on body electronics 110 associated with the
   extracted serial number has not been configured 1913, display device 120 is configured
   to transmit a wake up signal to on body electronics 110 which includes a configure
   command. In certain embodiments, wake up command from display device 120
   includes a serial number of on body electronics 110 so that only the on body electronics
   with the same serial number included in the wake up command detects and exits the
   inactive shelf mode and enter the active mode. More specifically, when the wake up

                                                  -58
      command including the serial number is received by on body electronics 110, control
      logic or one or more processors of on body electronics 110 executes routines 1903,
       1904, and 1905 to temporarily exit the shelf mode, when the RF energy received with
      the wakeup signal (including the configure command) exceeds the threshold level, and
      determines that it is not a valid query (as that determination was previously made and
      its serial number transmitted to display device 120). Thereafter, on body electronics
      110 determines whether the received serial number (which was received with the wake
      up command) matches its own stored serial number 1906. If the two serial numbers do
     not match, routine returns to the beginning where on body electronics 110 is again
     placed in inactive shelf mode 1902. On the other hand, if on body electronics 110
     determines that the received serial number matches its stored serial number 1906,
     control logic or one or more microprocessors of on body electronics 110 permanently
     latches on, and oscillators are turned on to activate on body electronics 110. Further,
     referring back to FIG, 19, when on body electronics 110 determines that the received
     serial number matches its own serial number 1906, display device 120 and on body
     electronics 110 are successfully paired 1916.
 [00220] In this manner, using a wireless signal to turn on and initialize on body
    electronics 110, the shelf life of on body electronics 110 may be prolonged since very
    little current is drawn or dissipated from on body electronics 110 power supply during
    the time period that on body electronics 110 is in inactive, shelf mode prior to
    operation. In certain embodiments, during the inactive shelf mode, on body electronics
    110 has minimal operation, if any, that require extremely low current. The RF envelope
    detector of on body electronics 110 may operate in two modes - a desensitized mode
    where it is responsive to received signals of less than about 1 inch, and normal
    operating mode with normal signal sensitivity such that it is responsive to receives
    signals at a distance of about 3-12 inches.
[00221] During the initial pairing between display device 120 and on body electronics
    110, in certain embodiments, display device 120 sends its identification information
   such as, for example, 4 bytes of display device ID which may include its serial number.
   On body electronics 110 stores the received display device ID in one or more storage
   unit or memory component and subsequently includes the stored display device ID data
   in response packets or data provided to the display device 120. In this manner, display
   device 120 can discriminate detected data packets from on body electronics 110 to
   determine that the received or detected data packets originated from the paired or

                                                -59
    correct on body electronics 110. The pairing routine based on the display device ID in
    certain embodiments avoids potential collision between multiple devices, especially in
    the cases where on body electronics 110 does not selectively provide the analyte related
    data to a particular display device, but rather, provide to any display device within
    range and/or broadcast the data packet to any display device in communication range.
[002221 In certain embodiments, the payload size from display device 120 to on body
    electronics 110 is 12 bytes, which includes 4 bytes of display device ID, 4 bytes of on
    body device ID, one byte of command data, one byte of spare data space, and two bytes
    for CRC (cyclic redundancy check) for error detection.
[00223] After pairing is complete, when display device 120 queries on body electronics
    110 for real time monitored analyte information and/or logged or stored analyte data, in
   certain embodiments, the responsive data packet transmitted to display device 120
   includes a total of 418 bytes that includes 34 bytes of status information, time
   information and calibration data, 96 bytes of the most recent 16 one-minute glucose
   data points, and 288 bytes of the most recent 15 minute interval glucose data over the
    12 hour period. Depending upon the size or capacity of the memory or storage unit of
   on body electronics 110, data stored and subsequently provided to the display device
    120 may have a different time resolution and/or span a longer or shorter time period.
   For example, with a larger data buffer, glucose related data provided to the display
   device 120 may include glucose data over a 24 hour time period at 15 minute sampling
   intervals, 10 minute sampling intervals, 5 minute sampling intervals, or one minute
   sampling interval. Further, the determined variation in the monitored analyte level
   illustrating historical trend of the monitored analyte level may be processed and/or
   determined by the on body electronics 110, or alternatively or in addition to, the stored
   data may be provided to the display device 120 which may then determine the trend
   information of the monitored analyte level based on the received data packets.
[002241 The size of the data packets provided to display device 120 from on body
   electronics 110 may also vary depending upon the communication protocol and/or the
   underlying data transmission frequency - whether using a 433 MHz, a 13.56 MHz, or
   2.45GHz in addition to other parameters such as, for example, the availability of a data
   processing devices such as a microprocessor (e.g., central processing unit CPU) in on
   body electronics 110, in addition to the ASIC state machine, size of the data buffer
   and/or memory, and the like.

                                                -60
[002251 In certain embodiments, upon successful activation of on body electronics 110
   and pairing with display device 120, control unit of display device 120 may be
   programmed to generate and output one or more visual, audible and/or haptic
   notifications to output to the user on display 122, or on the user interface of display
   device 120. In certain embodiments, only one display device can pair with one on body
   electronics at one time. Alternatively, in certain embodiments, one display device may
   be configured to pair with multiple on body electronics at the same time.
[00226] Once paired, display 122 of display device 120, for example, outputs, under the
   control of the microprocessor of display device 120, the remaining operational life of
   the analyte sensor 101 in user. Furthermore, as the end of sensor life approaches,
   display device may be configured to output notifications to alert the user of the
   approaching end of sensor life. The schedule for such notification may be programmed
   or programmable by the user and executed by the microprocessor of display device.

   embodiments. Referring to FIG. 20, display device 120 (FIG. 1) includes control unit
   2010, such as one or more microprocessors, operatively coupled to a display 122 and a
   user interface 121. The display device 120 may also include one or more data

   other wired communication ports) for data communication with a data processing
   module 160 (FIG. 1), remote terminal 170 (FIG. 1), or other devices such as a personal
   computer, a server, a mobile computing device, a mobile telephone, a pager, or other
   handheld data processing devices including mobile telephones such as internet
   connectivity enabled smart phones, with data communication and processing
   capabilities including data storage and output. Additional information on details of
   display device and other components of analyte monitoring system are provided in U.S.

   Applications No. 61,325,155, 61,325,021, the disclosure of each of which are
   incorporated by reference for all purposes.
[00228] Referring back to FIG. 20, display device 120 may include a strip port 124
   configured to receive in vitro test strips, the strip port 124 coupled to the control unit
   2010, and further, where the control unit 2010 includes programming to process the
   sample on the in vitro test strip which is received in the strip port 2030. Any suitable in

                                                -61
   vitro test strip may be employed, e.g., test strips that only require a very small amount
   (e.g., one microliter or less, e.g., about 0.5 microliter or less, e.g., about 0.1 microliter
   or less), of applied sample to the strip in order to obtain accurate glucose information,
   e.g. FreeStyle or Precision@ blood glucose test strips and systems from Abbott
   Diabetes Care Inc. Display devices with integrated in vitro monitors and test strip ports
   may be configured to conduct in vitro analyte monitoring with no user calibration in
   vitro test strips (i.e., no human intervention calibration), such as FreeStyle Lite glucose
   test strips from Abbott Diabetes Care Inc.
[002291 In certain embodiments, an integrated in vitro meter can accept and process a
   variety of different types of test strips (e.g., those that require user calibration and those
   that do not), some of which may use different technologies (those that operate using
   amperometric techniques and those that operate using coulometric techniques), etc.
   Detailed description of such test strips and devices with for conducting in vitro analyte
   monitoring is provided in U.S. Patent No. 6,377,894, 6,616,819, 7,749,740, 7,418,285;

   2008/0267823, 2010/0094110, 2010/0094111, and 2010/0094112, and U.S. Application
   No. 12/695,947, the disclosure of each of which are incorporated herein by reference
   for all purposes.
[002301 Glucose information obtained by the in vitro glucose testing device may be used
   for a variety of purposes, computations, etc. For example, the information may be
   used to calibrate analyte sensor 101 (FIG. 1) if the sensor requires in vivo calibration,
   confirm results of analyte sensor 101 to increase the confidence in the results from
   sensor 101 indicating the monitored analyte level (e.g., in instances in which
   information obtained by sensor 101 is employed in therapy related decisions), etc. In
   certain embodiments, analyte sensors do not require calibration by human intervention
   during its usage life. However, in certain embodiments, a system may be programmed
   to self-detect problems and take action, e.g., shut off and/or notify a user. For example,
   an analyte monitoring system may be configured to detect system malfunction, or
   potential degradation of sensor stability or potential adverse condition associated with
   the operation of the analyte sensor, the system may notify the user, using display device
   120 (FIG. 1) for example, to perform analyte sensor calibration or compare the results
   received from the analyte sensor corresponding to the monitored analyte level, to a
   reference value (such as a result from an in vitro blood glucose measurement).

                                               -62
[002311 In certain embodiments, when the potential adverse condition associated with the
   operation of the sensor, and/or potential sensor stability degradation condition is
   detected, the system may be configured to shut down (automatically without
   notification to the user, or after notifying the user) or disable the output or display of
   the monitored analyte level information received the on body electronics assembly. In
   certain embodiments, the analyte monitoring system may be shut down or disabled
   temporarily to provide an opportunity to the user to correct any detected adverse
   condition or sensor instability. In certain other embodiments, the analyte monitoring
   system may be permanently disabled when the adverse sensor operation condition or
   sensor instability is detected.
[002321 Referring still to FIG. 20, power supply 2020, such as one or more batteries,
   rechargeable or single use disposable, is also provided and operatively coupled to
   control unit 2010, and configured to provide the necessary power to display device 120
   (FIG. 1) for operation. In addition, display device 120 may include an antenna 2051
   such as a 433MHz (or other equivalent) loop antenna, 13.56 MHz antenna, or a
   2.45GHz antenna, coupled to a receiver processor 2050 (which may include a 433MHz,
    13.56MHz, or 2.45GHz transceiver chip, for example) for wireless communication with
   the on body electronics 110 (FIG. 1). Additionally, an inductive loop antenna 2041 is
   provided and coupled to a squarewave driver 2040 which is operatively coupled to
   control unit 2010.
[00233] In certain embodiments, antenna configurations including loop antenna
   configurations are provided for display device 120 for data communication at Ultra
   High Frequency (UHF) frequency bands, providing a real time analyte data acquisition
    system that includes display device 120 which is configured to generate a strong near
    electromagnetic field to provide power to on body electronics 110 to receive sampled
    and/or processed analyte related data from on body electronics 110. Such configuration
    also provides a weak far electromagnetic field such that the strength of the generated
    magnetic field at a far distance, such as about 3 meters away or 4 meters away or more
    from on body electronics 110 maintains the data communication range between on
    body electronics 110 and display device 120. In certain embodiments, display device
    120 may be configured for RF transmission at any frequency.
[002341 FIG. 21A is a schematic of the display device for use in the analyte monitoring
    systems of FIG. 1 in certain embodiments. Referring to the figure, display device 120
    (FIG. 1) configured to provide RF power to the on body electronics 110 (FIG. 1) in

                                              -63
   accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure, includes a surface acoustic wave
   (SAW) resonator 2101 which may include a resonator that generates the RF signal
   operating in conjunction with an oscillator (OSC) 2102. The oscillator 2102 is the
   active RF transistor component, and in conjunction with the SAW resonator 2101, is
   configured to send out control commands (the ping signals), transmit the RF power to
   receive the backscatter signal from the on body electronics 110, and generate local
   oscillation signal to the mixer 2103, as described in further detail below.
[00235] More specifically, in certain embodiments, in operation, the transmit data (TX
   data) as shown is the control signal generated by the control unit of the display device
   120 (FIG. 1), and an RF control command from the power amplifier (PA) 2106, is
   configured for transmission to on body electronics 110. SAW resonator 2102 in certain
   embodiments is configured to provide the carrier signal for the control commands (ping
   signals). The control signal from display device 120 (FIG. 1) in certain embodiments
   include data packets that are to be transmitted to on body electronics 110 to ping or
   prompt on body electronics 110, and to request for a response packet back display
   device 120.
[00236] In one embodiment, before the control signal is sent, a turn on signal from
   control unit of display device 120 is received at the TX enable line (as shown in FIG.
   21) and provided to oscillator 2102. After the control signal from the control unit is
   provided to oscillator 2102 and SAW resonator 2101, the carrier signal which is used to
   carry the control signal is maintained. The same carrier signal in one embodiment may
   be used to receive the response data packet from on body electronics 110 (FIG. 1).
[002371 When the RF control signal is provided to on body electronics 110 using the loop
   antenna and over the carrier signal, the RF power is provided at the same time
   (radiation energy) where the RF power is generated by oscillator 2102 in conjunction
   with SAW resonator 2101. In certain embodiments, because the carrier signal is
   maintained during transmit/receive time periods between display device 120 and on
   body electronics 110, the RF power is provided during the ping (or control signal)
   request transmission of the RF control signal, and also during the time period when the
   backscatter response is received from on body electronics 110. In certain embodiments,
   loop antenna 2108 of display device 120 uses the same carrier signal to transmit the RF
   power and the RF control signal to on body electronics 110, while in other
   embodiments different carrier signals are used.

                                               -64
 [002381 Referring back to FIG. 21A, further shown is LC power splitter 2107 which is
     configured in certain embodiments to split the power two ways - to buffer 2105 and to
    power amplifier (PA) 2106. Buffer 2105 in certain embodiments is configured to boost
     the RF signal received from LC power splitter 2104. Output of power amplifier 2106 is
     a control command that is provided to a second LC power splitter 2107 which splits the
     antenna signal (from the loop antenna into transmit signal (the control signal) and the
    receive signal (backscatter signal from on body electronics 110)). That is, in one
    embodiment, second LC power splitter 2107 may be configured to manage the
    transmit/receive signals using one loop antenna 2108. Referring again to FIG. 21A, in
    certain embodiments, a balun 2109 provided between the loop antenna 2108 and the
    second LC power splitter 2107 is used in one embodiment to match the balanced signal
    from the loop antenna 2108 to the unbalanced signal from the power splitter 2107 (as
    most circuit components are unbalanced relative to ground terminal). Balun 2109
    includes, in certain embodiments, an electrical transformer that converts electrical
    signals that are balanced about ground (differential) to signals that are unbalanced
    (single-ended), and vice versa, using electromagnetic coupling for operation.
[00239] Referring still to FIG. 21A, loop antenna 2108 transmits the RF control signal
    (the ping signal) and in response, receives a response packet from on body electronics
    110. In one aspect, the received response packet by the loop antenna is passed through
    the balun 2109, and via power splitter 2107 to SAW filter 2111. SAW filter 2111 in
    certain embodiments includes a bandpass filter configured to remove noise or
    interference components in the received response packet, for example. The output of
    SAW filter 2111 is passed through ASK receiver 2120. In one aspect, ASK receiver
    2120 includes low noise amplifier (LNA) 2121 whose output is sent to mixer 2103
   which mixes the low noise amplified signal output from LNA 2121 with the RF carrier
    signal from buffer 2105.
[00240] The output of mixer 2103 is passed to high pass filter (HPF) 2112 that filters out
   the DC component and low frequency components of the signal, and then the output of
   HPF 2112 is sent to the intermediate frequency amplifier (IF amplifier) 2113 which is
   configured to amplify the received signal. The amplified output signal from IF
   amplifier 2113 is provided to the low pass filter (LPF) 2122 of ASK receiver 2120, and
   the output low pass filtered signal from LPF 2122 is provided to another intermediate
   frequency amplifier 2123 of ASK receiver 2120 which is configured to amplify the low
   pass filtered signal output from the LPF 2122. As shown in FIG. 21A, IF amplifier

                                                  -65
    2123 of ASK receiver 2120 is provided between LPF 2122 and ASK demodulator
    2124.
 [002411 Referring yet still to FIG. 21A, the gain controller signal from IF amplifier 2123
    of ASK receiver 2120 controls the LNA 2121 that receives the filtered backscatter
    signal. The gain controller signal in one embodiment switches between high gain and
    low gain state of LNA 2121. For example, if IF amplifier 2123 has high gain, then the
    gain controller signal to LNA 2121 switches the LNA 2121 to low gain operation, and
    vice versa. As discussed above, the output of the IF amplifier 2123 of ASK receiver
    2120 is provided to ASK demodulator 2124 of ASK receiver 2120 which is configured
    to demodulate (or recover the data) the output signal from IF amplifier 2123.
[002421 That is, as shown in FIG. 21A, the RX enable line to ASK receiver 2120 is
    configured to turn on after the TX enable line where the turn on signal from the control
    unit is received in display device 120 such that with the receive enable signal from the
    control unit, the data out line (i.e., the output of ASK demodulator 2124) of ASK
    receiver 2120 provides the data or signal associated with the monitored glucose level
    based on the raw current signals from analyte sensor 101 (FIG. 1).
[00243] Referring again to FIG. 21A, in certain embodiments, an RF transmitter chip or
    an ASK transmitter may be included in display device 120 (FIG. 1) to replace the SAW
    resonator 2101, oscillator 2102, mixer 2103, LC power splitter 2104, buffer 2105,
    power amplifier 2106, high pass filter (HPF) 2112, and IF amplifier 2113 shown in
    FIG. 21 A. More specifically, in this embodiment, the RF transmitter chip may be
    coupled to a crystal which provides the frequency reference base for generating the RF
    carrier signal to receive the backscatter signal from on body electronics 110, and also to
    send the control commands (ping signals) to on body electronics 110.
[002441 In the embodiment discussed above, the RF transmitter chip or unit may be
    coupled to the LC power splitter, a balun and the loop antenna similar to the LC power
    splitter 2107, balun 2109, and loop antenna 2108 shown in FIG. 21A, in addition to a
    SAW filter and ASK receiver similar to the SAW filter 2111 and ASK receiver 2120
    shown in FIG. 21A. However, compared to the configuration shown in FIG. 21A, in
    alternate embodiments, another crystal may be coupled to the ASK receiver to provide
   the frequency reference base for receiving the backscatter signal from on body
   electronics 110.
[002451 FIG. 21 B illustrates a block diagram of display device 120 in the analyte
   monitoring system 100 of FIG. 1 in certain embodiments. Referring to FIG. 21 B, and

                                               -66
   in conjunction with FIG. 1, display device 120 includes control unit 2150 operatively
   coupled to the components as shown in the Figure including input/user interface 2151,
   display 2152, memory 2153, and RFID transceiver 2156. As further shown in FIG.
   21B, RFID transceiver 2156 in certain embodiments is operatively coupled to matching
   circuit/filter 2155 that is coupled to antenna 2154. Matching circuit/filter 2155 in
   certain embodiments is configured to tune and/or match the signals between the on
   body electronics 110 (FIG. 1) and display device 120, sent and received via antenna
   2154. Antenna 2154, in certain embodiments includes a 13.56 MHz RFID antenna
   where RFID transceiver 2156 is configured to operate in the 13.56 MHz frequency. In
   certain embodiments, RFID transceiver 2156 may include a user programmable
   modulation depth in write mode where data or command is sent, whereas single
   subcarrier, frequency shift keying (FSK) and phase shift keying (PSK) modulations are
   recognized in the read mode where data is received from on body electronics 110, for
   example. Moreover, a logarithmic amplifier may be used for single subcarrier detection
   for data recovery from on body electronics 110.
[00246] Referring again to FIG. 21B, control unit 2150 in certain embodiments include
   one or more microcontrollers or processors, ASIC with programmed logic for execution
   by one or more state machines for controlling and executing the operation of the reader
   (FIG. 1). Memory 2153 in certain embodiments includes volatile memory and/or non
   volatile memory for data storage.
[00247] In certain embodiments, data communication between on body electronics 110
   and display device 120 may be achieved at the 2.45GHz ISM band. In certain
   embodiments, display device 120 (FIG. 1) is configured to listen for a clear channel on
   2.45GHz radio frequency band. When a clear channel is detected and selected, a clear
   channel identifier is sent to a control unit of an on body electronics 110 (FIG. 1). After
   the clear channel identifier is received, the data packets are provided to the receiver
   unit. Thus, the power drain of the "listen before talk" process required of operation in
   the 2.45GHz ISM band, comes off of the larger batteries in display device 120,
   conserving power in the on body electronics 110.
[00248] An exemplary process for using this communications system is illustrated in the
   schematic diagram of FIG. 22 in conjunction with the routine shown in FIG. 23. When
   the user desires or requires an analyte reading, such as a current glucose level, and/or
   wants to collect logged analyte data, display device 120 can be used to find a clear
   channel (2201) on the 2.45 GHz band (2221), and then, to separately send an OOK (or

                                             -67
   other suitably modulated) message to the on body electronics 2211, communicating a
   clear frequency identifier (2202). On body electronics 2211 then responds with a high
   baud rate stream of data packets, transmitted over the clear channel (2203). With this
   procedure, on body electronics 2211 does not have to perform the "listen to talk"
   routine because this routine has been conducted by the display device 120.
[00249] Referring again to FIGS. 22-23, in certain embodiments, display device 120 may
   include an RF transceiver, with an RF transmitter on the 2.45GHz band coupled to
   antenna 2214 (schematically shown as external; however, the antenna may be mounted
   internally to the display device 120). It also may have a digitally modulated RF
   signaling function, which can be an OOK signaling function, either in the 2.45GHz
   band or some other band (in which case there could be a second antenna on the
   receiving unit (not shown)). The on body electronics 2211 in certain embodiments
   includes a data processing unit in which the power supply may be a small battery, and
   the RF transmitter/receiver can be a low power 2.45GHz transceiver, e.g., a Texas
   Instruments@V CC25 10 integrated circuit, which, in addition to the 2.45GHz radio, also
   provides a microprocessor (CPU), memory, analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), and
   signal processing functions.
[00250] In certain embodiments, the RF communication component of the on body
   device 2211 may be coupled to antenna 2213 (schematically shown as external;
   however, the antenna may be mounted internally to the on body device 2211). The on
   body electronics 2211 may also have a receiver capable of receiving a digitally
   modulated signal containing a clear channel identifier. In this regard, the RF
   transceiver may be configured as an ultra low power OOK receiver that requires
   extremely low power to listen, but only has a limited listening range. The listening
   range is sufficient, however, to be operable when the receiver unit 120 is in proximity
   to the on body electronics 2211, for example when one unit is placed next to the other
   within a predetermined distance of for example, less than about 10 inches, less than
   about 5 inches, less than about 3 inches, or less than about one inch, or any other
   suitable distance.
[002511 In certain embodiments, data packets received from on body electronics and
   received in response to a request from display device, for example, include one or more
   of a current glucose level from the analyte sensor, a current estimated rate of glycemic
   change, and a glucose trend history based on automatic readings acquired and stored in
   memory of on skin electronics. For example, current glucose level may be output on

                                              -68
   display 122 of display device 120 as a numerical value, the current estimated rage of
   glycemic change may be output on display 122 as a directional arrow 133 (FIG. 1), and
   glucose trend history based on stored monitored values may be output on display 122 as
   a graphical trace 138 (FIG. 1). In certain embodiments, microprocessor of display
   device 120 may be programmed to output more or less information on display 122, and
   further, the type and amount of information output on display 122 may be programmed
   or programmable by the user.
[002521 In certain embodiments, display device 120 is programmed to maintain a time
   period between each consecutive of analyte data request from on body electronics 110.
   For example, in certain embodiments, display device 120 is configured such that after
   an initial analyte data request has been sent to on body electronics 110, and the
   monitored analyte level information received from on body electronics 110, display
   device 120 disallows a subsequent analyte data request to be sent to on body electronics
    110 until a predetermined time period has elapsed measured from the transmission of
   the initial analyte data request. For example, when display device 120 is operated to
   send to on body electronics 110 a request for analyte related data, an internal clock or
   timer of the display device 120 starts or activates the internal clock or timer
   programmed with a predetermined time period to count down. Display device 120 in
   certain embodiments include programming to disable or prevent sending the second,
   subsequent request for analyte data from on body electronics 110 until after the
   predetermined time period has elapsed.
[00253] In certain embodiments, the predetermined time period includes about 120
   seconds, about 90 seconds, about 60 seconds, or about seconds or less. The
   predetermined time period in certain embodiments is determined by the time period for
   performing analog to digital conversion by on body electronics 110 to convert the
   sampled signal from monitoring the analyte level to a corresponding digital signal for
   transmission and/or the sampling period of analyte sensor 101, monitoring analyte level
   every minute, or every 5 minutes, or every 10 minutes or other suitable time interval.
   The time interval in certain embodiments may be pre-programmed as software logic in
   on body electronics 110, or alternatively, is programmable and can be modified during
   in vivo sensor use.
[00254] In certain embodiments, display device 120 requires a minimum time period to
   elapse between each successive analyte data request from on body electronics 110 to
   avoid corrupting the data in on body electronics 110. For example, when the analog to

                                               -69
   digital (A/D) conversion routine is being executed by on body electronics 110 (for
   example, during the initial 30 second window for each 1 minute sampling period
   associated with analyte sensor 101), of display device 120 transmits an analyte data
   request (for example, the RF power level from display device 120 may disrupt the A/D
   conversion routine or otherwise corrupt the data resulting from the A/D conversion
   routine being executed by on body electronics 110. Accordingly, in certain
   embodiments, display device 120 is programmed to disallow sending a request for
   analyte data from on body electronics (110) (for example, performing a read function
   by display device 120) during an (A/D) conversion cycle in on body electronics 110.
   Accordingly, the time interval between data requests from display device 120 ensures
   that the A/D conversion routine is complete in on body electronics 110 when display
   device 120 sends the data request to on body electronics 110.
[002551 In certain embodiments, display device 120 may be programmed or
   programmable to discard or identify received data from on body electronics 110 that is
   corrupt or otherwise includes error. For example, in certain embodiments, a minimum
   time period between subsequent analyte data request is not enforced or programmed in
   display device 120. However, display device 120 includes software routines identify
   data that is corrupt or not based on examining the data packet. For example, each data
   packet received from on body electronics 110 includes a single bit or a byte or other
   suitable portion of the data packet that provides an indication of the data status. In the
   case of a single bit as the data status identifier in the data packet from on body
   electronics 110, in certain embodiments, a value of 1 indicates that the data is not
   corrupt. In such embodiments, on body electronics 110 is configured to reset this bit in
   the data packet to 0 at the end of each sampling period (for example, after each minute),
   and change the value to 1 when the A/D conversion routine is completed during the
   sampling period without error.
Embodiments of Data Processing Routines
[00256] In certain embodiments, data from on body electronics 110 (FIG. 1) provided to
   display device 120 may include raw monitored analyte level data, measured or
   monitored temperature data, stored past monitored analyte level data, analyte level
   trend data (such as a series of consecutive or near consecutive data points
   corresponding to the monitored analyte level) that was stored or buffered in the on body
   electronics for a predetermined time period, since the activation of the on body

                                               -70
    electronics, or since the time period when the last data packet or signals were provided
    to the display device, or any one or more combinations of the above. For example, the
    historical information constructed by a series of consecutive and/or near consecutive
    data points corresponding to the monitored analyte level may indicate the variation in
    the monitored analyte level over the particular time period based on signals received
    from the analyte sensor and stored in the on body electronics.
[002571 In certain embodiments, display device 120 is configured to determine and adjust
    for deviation or drift of time base in on body electronics 110 such that the analyte
    sensor 101 life is monitored and accurately terminated upon expiration of its useful
    time period. In certain embodiments, on body electronics 110 include limited storage
    capacity in its memory (for example, storing the past 24 hours, or 12 hours, or 8 hours,
    or 5 hours of logged data, overwriting the older data). In such cases, if the sensor is not
    disabled when it reaches the end of its useful life time period (for example, 10 days, or
    seven days, or five days, or three days), the logged data will be overwritten by new data
    generated from the expired sensor.
[002581 More specifically, FIG. 24 is a flowchart illustrating a routine for determining the
    sensor expiration information by display device 120 for communication to on body
    electronics in certain embodiments. Display device 120 is configured to track time
    information accurately based on its internal clock(s). In certain embodiments, on body
    electronics 110 is programmed with total sample number information that corresponds
    to the sensor life duration. For example, if the sensor is a 10 day sensor, and it is
    configured to sample analyte level in ISF once every minute, the total sample number
    for the 10 day analyte sensor is 14,400 samples (60 mins/hr * 24hrs/day * 10 days).
    When display device 120 receives a data packet with the sample number information
    from on body electronics 110, display device 120 in certain embodiments include
    software routines that are executed to determine, based on the sample number received
    from the on body electronics 110 and time information from the internal clock or
   crystal of the display device 120, the correct total sample number for the sensor 101.
[00259] For example, referring to FIG. 24, when display device 120 receives a data
   packet from on body electronics 110 (2410), microprocessor or controller of display
   device 120 extracts sample number information associated with the received data
   packet in addition to other data such as current analyte level data, current temperature
   data, stored historical monitored analyte data, for example (2420). Display device 120
   then retrieves the analyte sensor expiration information (for example, in time based unit

                                                -71
   such as 14,400 minutes for 10 day sensors) and multiplies the retrieved sensor
   expiration time information with the received sample number (2430). The resulting
   value from the multiplication is then divided by the time elapsed since sensor
   initialization (measured, for example, in time based units) (2440), resulting in the
   corrected expiration sample number for the analyte sensor.
[002601 When the display device 120 is in subsequent communication with on body
   electronics 110, the determined expiration sample number is transmitted to on body
   electronics 110. On body electronics 110, in turn, stores the received expiration sample
   number, and compares the sample number for each sampled analyte from the analyte
   sensor, and when the sample number corresponding to the sample analyte level from
   the analyte sensor matches or exceeds the received expiration sample number, on body
   electronics 110 is programmed to no longer log data. In this manner, in certain
   embodiments, display device 120 is configured to determine correction to the sensor
   expiration or end of life time period for the sensor, and communicate the adjustment or
   correction to on body electronics 110 so that data logged from unexpired analyte sensor
   is not overwritten by data from sensor whose useful life has ended.
[002611     In the manner described above, a first order model is provided to correct for
   sensor expiration time period deviation. In certain embodiments, second or higher
   order models or polynomials may be used to improve accuracy of the sensor life
   expiration determination. For example, the first order model described in conjunction
   with FIG. 24 assumes that the on body electronics time reference remains substantially
   constant during the sensor life. In cases where the time reference does not remain
   constant during the sensor life, a weighing function may be introduced such that,
   different weighing function is applied at the initial stage of sensor life compared to the
   later stage of the sensor life, such that the average value over the course of the sensor
   life more accurately represents the true sensor expiration time period.
[002621 Furthermore, in certain embodiment, the time base of the on body electronics
   may accumulate error continuously from the start of the sensor life until the last
   sampled data logged at the end of the sensor life. In certain embodiments, display
   device 120 may be configured to determine a precise time-sample number pair each
   time data packet is received from on body electronics 110. To address the
   accumulation of error in on body electronics time base, display device 120 in certain
   embodiments, for each data packet received from on body electronics 110, display
   device 120 determines a new time-sample number pair. By keeping the previous time-

                                             -72
   sample pair, the display device 120 may perform piece wise interpolation to determine
   the actual time of each sample logged and received from on body electronics 110.
[00263] For example, at sample time t = 980 (e.g., elapsed time since sensor insertion and
   initialization), with sample number of 1,000, and at sample time t = 2020 corresponding
   to sample number 2000, piece wise interpolation yields an increment in time t of 104
   for each increment of 100 in sample number as shown below:
Table 1
                               Sample Number         Time
                               1000                  980
                               1100                  1084
                               1200                  1188
                               1300                  1292
                               1400                  1396
                               1500                  1500
                               1600                  1604
                               1700                  1708
                               1800                  1812
                               1900                  1916
                               2000                  2020
[00264] As can be seen in conjunction with Table 1 above, in certain embodiments, using
   interpolation based on the two sample number - time pairs, actual sample time for each
   sample can be determined, and any error accumulated or introduced by on body
   electronics 110 may be corrected.
[00265] Referring back to the Figures, an exemplary implementation of the on body
   electronics adapted to process signals from the analyte sensor and to provide the
   processed or raw signals to the display device in response to such data request or upon
   demand is shown in FIG. 25. Referring to FIG. 25, there are provided a sensor 2511,
   clock 2519, processor 2517 and input/output (I/O) interface 2513. The functions of the
   memory are performed in part by shift register 2523. Shift register 2523 provides
   storage locations for n measurements from most current measurement T, to the nth past
   measurement T(n.1). Each storage location T1 x provides an output into a multiplier,
   each configured to input a multiplicative weighting factor m. Each multiplier product

                                               -73
    is input into a corresponding summer Sx, and the summers are chained to provide a
   composite weighted sum (weighted average) in summer So. Processor 2517 may also be
   adapted to read the individual values T, to T1..(n), and possibly individual sums. The
   multiplicative weighing factors may also be adjustable through processor 2517,
   responsive to two-way communications from a commanding device such as the display
   device 120 (FIG. 1). In certain embodiments a weighing factor in binary form may be
   used, which could be adjusted by a series of left or right shifts. This implementation
   might further include a similar (but likely smaller) additional shift register-multiplier
   summer structure (not shown) to store a sequence of averages from summer So, and
   provided a moving average of those averages, whose values and averages would be
   likewise provided to processor 2517.
[00266] Certain embodiments may be used to efficiently determine, store and provide
   upon request, the real time monitored analyte data, averaged analyte data and/or rate-of
   change information of the monitored analyte. For example, a moving average may be
   used to indicate a trend in the monitored analyte level. If, for example, there were four
   storage elements (n = 4), receiving shifted-in analyte measurement data once per
   minute, a multiplier of 1/n (e.g.,  /4)may  be used, in which case the trend or variation in
   the monitored analyte level may be regarded as the average of the past four samples. In
   another example, trend data might be the average of the third and fourth samples, in
   which case the weighing factors would be 0, 0, 2 and /2. In one embodiment, there may
   be 15 storage elements (with sensor data again collected once per minute), with two
   calculated trends - the first over the past 10 minute and the second over the full 15
   minutes. In addition on body electronics may store selected data on a long term basis,
   for example once every 15 or 20 minutes, for an extended wear period of on body unit 1
   (e.g., up to several weeks).
[00267] Other approaches involving the determination of the analyte level and/or trend
   information or like or analogous components used for the same will be apparent to
   those of skill in the art. For example, the first location and the second location may be
   the same, e.g., data is overwritten. FIG. 26 shows a further memory structure that may
   be employed, which stores long term data at a slower sampling rate (short term trend
   vs. long term history). In one embodiment, clock signal 2551, e.g., a one-minute clock,
   may be divided by N in clock divider 2552. N may be any desired number, for
   example, 5, 10, 15, 20, 60 or other desired value in order to generate the desired time
   base for measurements. In certain embodiments, an analyte measurement may be

                                             -74
   determined (and not immediately provided to the display device), and stored in a
   memory or storage location. In one embodiment, an n-position shift register may be
   employed for this purpose, in which each measurement 2553-1, etc. to 2553-n is
   sequentially entered and shifted in the shift register. The most recent measurement at
   any time will be 2553-1. Alternatively, the memory or storage employed for this
   purpose may be addressable, and used as a circular buffer, with a pointer to the most
   recent measurement value. In certain embodiments (not shown), two or more sections
   as illustrated in FIG. 26 may be cascaded, to provide a plurality of further spaced apart
   measurements, e.g., over a period of hours.
[002681 FIGS. 27A-27D illustrate routines to determine periodic and/or averaged and/or
   rate-of-change data from monitored analyte level in analyte monitoring system 100 of
   FIG. 1. Referring to the Figures, a time or a series of times for taking sensor
   measurements may be derived from clock pulses, and separate measurements taken at
   such time or times (2710). In certain embodiments, a series of measurements (2715)
   may be digitized and directly recorded (2720, 2725). In other embodiments, a
   calculation, such as a rolling average of measurements, may be performed (2720) and
   the resulting value recorded (2725). In either case, at least one element (e.g., a
   measurement or an average) may be recorded or stored in a memory location of a
   memory device in on body electronics 110. A second computation may then be
   performed based upon the stored value(s), and the results of the computation again
   stored (e.g., each new analyte measurement may be accompanied by the further
   calculation (2720) of an updated average value or rate data). This process may be
   repeated continuously (e.g., returning to 2710), such that at any time there may be
   stored in on body electronics 110, or other storage device, whatever data is of interest,
   e.g., a sequence of measurements, a sequence of averages, and/or a current moving
   average of some number (n) of prior measurements.
[002691 Responsive to a user command (by actuation of a switch on the display device
    120 (FIG. 1) or by positioning the display device 120 (FIG. 1) within a predetermined
   distance to on body electronics 110 (2730), the monitored analyte level information
   from the analyte sensor is provided to display device 120. In some embodiments, the
   user command is a user input, such as pressing a button or an actuator. In other
   embodiments, the user command includes both placing the display device 120 and on
   body electronics 110 within a defined communication range as well providing a user
   input.

[002701 Referring now to FIGS. 27A and 27B, in certain embodiments, after starting or
   initiating the data processing routine (2705), a processor or programmed logic of the on
   body electronics 110 (FIG. 1) may be configured to verify one or more signals from a
   clock and determine, (2710), whether it was time to take a sensor measurement. If yes,
   then analyte sensor 101 reading is acquired by on body electronics 110 (2715). This
   value could be used as is (a measurement point), or processed in some manner (e.g., to
   calculate an updated rolling average based on a past rolling average), and the result
   (from 2720) stored in a memory location in the on body electronics 110 (2725). The
   measurement or rolling average points will be referred to as data set 1, and the stored
   data will be referred to as data set 2. The process may repeat in a loop (2710). In
   embodiments in which a plurality of storage locations is provided, new values are
   continuously stored, and the oldest values deleted or de-referenced.
[002711 At any time unrelated to the state of cycling of loop 2710-2745, a user may
   initiate a data request (2730). This will start a sub-process in which one or more values
   of interest may be loaded from the storage of data set 2 (2735). The selection, which
   may or may not be a different set, will be referred to as data set 3. Data set 3 may be
   subjected to optional further processing within on body electronics 110 (2740). For
   example, where data set 2 is a sequence of periodic analyte measurements the routine
   includes calculating a weighted moving average of the measurements and/or filtering,
   or the like (2740). The data set 3 data is reported to display device 120 (2745). For
   example, the data set 3 data could include a series of periodic sensor measurements plus
   moving average data.
[00272] As shown in FIG. 27C, the routine may also include a rate-of-change of the
   monitored analyte level determination (2780). For example, a current analyte sensor
   measurement may be retrieved (2731) and based on which a rate-of-change information
   of the monitored analyte level may be determined. For example, referring to FIG. 27D,
   data set 2 may be the same as data set 1 (2790), and includes a set of periodic analyte
   measurements, which are stored (2791). Referring again to the Figure, the most current
   analyte measurement and a moving average are determined (2792), computing a rate of
   change on that basis (2793). Within the scope of the present disclosure, different rates
   may be provided by comparison to averages determined in different ways or over a
   different number of measurements.
[002731 Where a plurality of storage elements are used, for instance, n elements, storing a
   data element could be accompanied by freeing the space occupied by the n*h previously

                                                -76
      recorded element, for example by overwriting data, physically shifting data in a
     register, pushing or popping data from a stack structure, queuing or dequeuing data
     from a queue, or by changing pointers into a memory area in some other manner.
 [002741 In embodiments in which averages are calculated, the averages may be weighted
     averages. In a simple case, the weighting factors could all be equal. Alternatively,
     certain factors could be reduced to zero in order to eliminate one or more
     measurements. Alternatively, weighting factors could be varied to attenuate or
     emphasize data from specific points in time. In some embodiments, where the data of
     interest is a sequence of measurements, the second calculation referred to above could
     be bypassed by simply using the first values recorded (e.g., without calculating or
     storing an average).
 [00275] Where an average has been calculated and recorded or stored, a further
     calculation may be performed and the results used for further processing and/or
     communicating the results to another device or remote location, reflecting a further
     calculation performed on a current measurement and the average. For example,
    comparison of a current reading with a stored moving average would be a value
    indicative of the current analyte level rate of change or analyte data trend information.
    Additionally, successive rate-of-change figures may be recorded or stored in order to
    provide for the calculation of a moving average rate-of-change that might be less noisy
    than an instantaneous figure based on a single measurement compared to an average.
[00276] FIG. 28 is a flowchart illustrating a glucose data acquisition notification routine
    in certain embodiments. Referring to FIG. 28, in one aspect, the display device 120
    (FIG. 1) or a similar controller or data processing device may be configured to generate
    an output notification such as audible, vibratory, visual, or one or more combination
   notifications to indicate a successful glucose data acquisition received from the on body
   electronics 110 (FIG. 1) in signal communication with an analyte sensor such as a
   glucose sensor. That is, referring to FIG. 28, upon receipt of the analyte related
   response signal or data packet (2810), the display device 120 generates and asserts a
   first notification (2820) which may be a short audible tone. In certain embodiments, the
   first notification may be programmed in display device 120, or may be programmable
   by the user with customized output alert such as a ring tone, or a visual output (for
   example, a flashing indication on the screen of the display device) representing
   successful real time glucose data acquisition or receipt from the on body electronics
   110. In certain aspects embodiments, receipt of the analyte related response signal or

                                                -77
    data packet (2810) is received in response to a request for the real time analyte data
    using, for example, RFID techniques, to acquire data in response to a data request (e.g.,
    on demand).
 [002771 In certain embodiments, the first notification may be programmed to be
    automatically asserted when the desired glucose data is received when the display
    device 120 is positioned within the predetermined distance from the on body electronics
     110 to receive the backscatter signal from the on body electronics 110.
 [00278] Referring again to FIG. 28, after the assertion of the first notification, it is
    determined whether stored analyte data is subsequently or concurrently received with
    the real time glucose data (2830). That is, in one aspect, in addition to the glucose data
    received from the on body electronics 110, display device 120 may be configured to
    receive additional glucose related information such as stored prior glucose data, sensor
    related data, such as sensor manufacturing code, calibration information, sensor status,
    device operational status information, updated battery life status of the device or any
    other information that may be provided to the display device 120 from the on body
    electronics 110. In aspects of the present disclosure, the additional or other information
    detected by the display device 120 including, for example, stored prior analyte data may
    be received after the real time glucose data acquisition. Alternatively, this additional
    data may be received concurrent or substantially contemporaneous to the receipt of the
    real time glucose data.
[002791 When the receipt of stored analyte data and/or other additional information is
    detected (2830), display device 120 in one aspect of the present disclosure may be
    configured to assert a second notification (2840) such as an audible alarm, alert, output
    tone, a ring tone, a vibratory indication, a visual output indication, or one or more
    combinations of the above to notify the user that the additional information has been
    successfully acquired or received by the display device 120. On the other hand, if it is
    determined that the additional information is not received by the display device 120,
   then the routine terminates.
[00280] In certain aspects, the assertion of the first notification and/or the second
   notification depends upon the duration of positioning the display device 120 in close
   proximity and within the short RF range of the on body electronics 110. That is, when
   the display device 120 is positioned within the communication range of the on body
   electronics 110 to transmit the request for glucose data, and in response, receives a
   responsive data packet including the real time glucose information, the display device

                                                 -78
    120 alerts the user with the first notification to confirm and/or notify the user that the
   real time glucose data has been successfully acquired or received from the on body
    electronics 110. Thereafter, if the display device 120 is maintained within substantially
   the same distance or closer to the on body electronics 110 for an extended or further
   time period, and the display device 120 detects the receipt of additional information or
   data packets from the on body electronics 110 (including, for example, historical or
    stored prior glucose related information), the display device 120 in one embodiment
   asserts the second notification or alert to the user to confirm and/or notify that
   additional information has been successfully received from the on body electronics 110.
[00281] In this manner, by positioning the display device 120 within a predetermined
   distance to the on body electronics 110, the user can receive or acquire real time and/or
   optionally historical glucose data and provided with confirmation notification of
    successful data acquisition, for example, with a first notification indicating successful
   real time glucose data acquisition, and a second notification indicating successful data
   acquisition of additional glucose or device related data. In certain embodiments, the
   first and second notifications may be the same, or different in characteristics. For
   example, in the embodiment where the notifications are audible tones, each of the first
   and second notifications may have different tone duration, pitch, and the like.
   Alternatively, the first and second notifications may share one or more characteristics
   (such as the pitch), but with at least one unique characteristic (such as duration of the
   tone), such that the two notifications can be distinguished. Furthermore in accordance
   with aspects of the present disclosure, additional notifications may be programmed or
   provided to the display device 220 (or customized by the user) to include, for example,
   multiple output notifications each associated with a particular data acquisition mode or
   event.
[00282] In certain embodiments, analyte monitoring systems may be calibrated as part of
   manufacturing and shipped as already calibrated. FIG. 29 is a flowchart illustrating
   sensor calibration achieved as part of manufacturing in certain embodiments. Referring
   to FIG. 29, a determination of sensor sensitivity is performed during manufacture
   (2901). A calibration number is then assigned in connection with the sensor sensitivity
   determined during manufacture (2902). Then the user is instructed to enter, and in
   response thereto enters, the calibration number into the receiver unit (such as the
   display device 120 of FIG. 1) (2903). Using the sensor sensitivity information
   associated with the calibration number, after receiving analyte sensor measurement

                                              -79
   (2904), the display device processes the analyte sensor measurement data in
   conjunction with the sensor sensitivity information to calibrate the analyte monitoring
   system.
[002831 In certain embodiments, the analyte monitoring system may be calibrated as part
   of manufacturing and may require no user calibration. In other embodiments, the
   analyte monitoring system may not require any calibration, including factory
   calibration. Further detailed description regarding analyte sensors and sensor systems
   that do not require calibration by human intervention is provided in U.S. patent
   application no. 12/714,439, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference
   in its entirety for all purposes. Moreover, further details related to calibration and
   obtaining system measurements of continuous analyte monitoring systems can be found
   in, for example, U.S. publication nos. 2009/0005665; 2008/0288204; 2008/0006034;
   2008/0255808; 2008/0256048; 2009/0006034; 2008/0312842; 2008/0312845;

   61/247,508, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated in their entirety by
   reference for all purposes.
[002841 In certain embodiments, calibration of the analyte sensor by human intervention
   is not required, and therefore not performed prior to the output of clinically accurate
   analyte data. For example, the tolerances achieved during manufacturing and/or
   stability of a given sensor over time may be such that calibration by human intervention
   is not required, see for example, U.S. Patent Application No. 11/322,165, 11/759,923,
   61/155,889, 61/155,891, and 61/155,893, the disclosures of each of which are
   incorporated by reference in their entireties herein for all purposes.
[00285] Referring back to FIG. 1, in certain embodiments, analyte monitoring system 100
   may store the historical analyte data along with a date and/or time stamp and/or and
   contemporaneous temperature measurement, in memory, such as a memory configured
   as a data logger as described above. In certain embodiments, analyte data is stored at
   the frequency of about once per minute, or about once every ten minutes, or about once
   an hour, etc. Data logger embodiments may store historical analyte data for a
   predetermined period of time, e.g., a duration specified by a physician, for example,
   e.g., about 1 day to about 1 month or more, e.g., about 3 days or more, e.g., about 5
   days or more, e.g., about 7 days or more, e.g., about 2 weeks or more, e.g., about 1
   month or more.

                                               -80
[002861 Other durations of time may be suitable, depending on the clinical significance of
   the data being observed. The analyte monitoring system 100 may display the analyte
   readings to the subject during the monitoring period. In some embodiments, no data is
   displayed to the subject. Optionally, the data logger can transmit the historical analyte
   data to a receiving device disposed adjacent, e.g., in close proximity to the data logger.
   For example, a receiving device may be configured to communicate with the data
   logger using a transmission protocol operative at low power over distances of a fraction
   of an inch to about several feet. For example, and without limitation, such close
   proximity protocols include Certified Wireless USBTM, TransferJetTM, Bluetooth@
   (IEEE 802.15.1), WiFi TM (IEEE 802.11), ZigBee@ (IEEE 802.15.4-2006), Wibree TM,
   or the like.
[00287] The historical analyte data set may be analyzed using various diagnostic
   approaches. For example, the historical analyte data taken over several days may be
   correlated to the same date/and or time. The historical analyte data may be correlated to
   meal times, For example, data could take into account breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   Data analysis for each meal could include some pre-prandial time (e.g. 1 or 2 hours)
   and some post-prandial time e.g. 1-4 hours). Such an approach eliminates apparent
   glucose variability due to variability in the timing of meals alone. Analyte data
   parameters may be determined based upon the rate of change of one or more analyte
   levels. In some embodiments, an analyte data parameter may be determined concerning
   whether a threshold relating to an analyte value is exceeded, e.g., a hyper-or
   hypoglycemia condition, the percentage of time in which the threshold is exceeded, or
   the duration of time in which the threshold is exceeded.
[002881 The analyte data parameters may be computed by a processor executing a
   program stored in a memory. In certain embodiments, the processor executing the
   program stored in the memory is provided in data processing module 160 (FIG. 1). In
   certain embodiments, the processor executing the program stored in the memory is
   provided in display device 120. An exemplary technique for analyzing data is the
   applied ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) analysis technique.
[002891 Additional detailed descriptions are provided in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,262,035;
   5,264,104; 5,262,305; 5,320,715; 5,593,852; 6,175,752; 6,650,471; 6,746, 582,
   6,284,478, 7,299,082, and in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 10/745,878; 11/060,365, the
   disclosure of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

                                                -81
[002901 As described above, in certain aspects of the present disclosure, discrete glucose
   measurement data may be acquired on-demand or upon request from the display device,
   where the glucose measurement is obtained from an in vivo glucose sensor
   transcutaneously positioned under the skin layer of a user, and further having a portion
   of the sensor maintained in fluid contact with the ISF under the skin layer.
   Accordingly, in aspects of the present disclosure, the user of the analyte monitoring
   system may conveniently determine real time glucose information at any time, using
   the RFID communication protocol as described above.
[00291] FIGS. 30A-30D illustrate embodiments of the analyte data acquisition module
   for use with display device 120 in certain embodiments. Referring to FIGS. 30A-30D,
   display device 120 may include an input mechanism such as a user actuatable button
   3001 positioned on an outer surface of the housing of the display device 120. While the
   embodiment shown in FIG. 30C positions the button 3001 on the opposing surface of
   display device 120 as the location of display 122 (FIG. 1), in certain embodiments, the
   button 3001 may be positioned along any suitable axis along a length or a width
   dimension of display device 120, as long as the button 3001 can be easily accessed by
   either hands of the user to provide ambidextrous operation of button 3001. That is, in
   certain embodiments, display device 120 may be provided with an input mechanism
   such as user actuatable button 3001 positioned on its housing such that the button is
   within comfortable and convenient reach for activation, regardless of whether the
   display device 120 is held in the left hand or the right hand of the user.
[002921 For example, button 3001 may be positioned on the opposing surface of or the
   back housing of display device 120 such that it is located substantially equidistant from
   either side edges of the display device 120 housing. That is, in certain embodiments,
   the position of the button 3001 is substantially in alignment with the central
   longitudinal axis of the display device 120. In certain embodiments, button 3001 may
   be positioned along the upper outer peripheral edge surface of the display device 120
   such that it is located at substantially the opposite location to the location of the strip
   port 124 on the display device 120. While several specific locations and position of
   button 3001 is described above, within the scope of the present disclosure, button 3001
   may be positioned in other suitable location of the display device 120, including, for
   example, on the same planar surface of the housing as display 122 of display device
   120

                                               -82
 [002931 In certain embodiments, actuation of the button 3001 on display device 120
    initiates one or more routines that are programmed in the display device 120. For
    example, actuation of button 3001 may initiate the routine for wireless turn on of the on
    body electronics 110 as described above. In certain embodiments, actuation of button
    3001 executes the software routine to initiate data transfer request to acquire analyte
    related data from on body electronics 110 (FIG. 1), when the display device 120 is
    positioned within the predetermined distance from the on body electronics 110 to
    receive the data communication. In still other embodiments, actuation of button 3001
    initiates the backlight function to illuminate the display 122 of display device 120.
    Button 3001 may also be programmed as a power on/off switch. Within the scope of
    the present disclosure, other functions of display device 120 may be associated with the
    actuation of button 3001.
 [00294] Referring back to FIGS. 30A-30D, in certain embodiments, a mateable sleeve
    3010 may be provided to couple to the display device 120. In certain embodiments,
    electrical contact with display device 120 may be achieved by accessing the battery
    compartment of display device 120. More specifically, with battery compartment cover
    3040 of display device 120 removed as shown in FIG. 30A, the exposed battery
    contacts of display device 120 may be connected to corresponding electrical contacts in
    sleeve 3010 when mated with display device 120. After mating with display device
    120, actuation of button 3011 on the sleeve 3010 activates or initiates the routines
    similar to those discussed above in conjunction with button 3001 on the housing of
    display device 120. As shown in the Figures, in certain embodiments, the sleeve 3010
    may be mated with display device 120 to electrically connect with the battery
    compartment contacts by securing the sleeve 3010 over one end of the display device
    120 as shown and displaced in the direction indicated by directional arrow 3012. In
    certain embodiments, sleeve 3010 may be mated with display device 120 by applying
    pressure upon its surface against the display device 120 housing, and secure thereon in
    a snap fit manner. In certain other embodiments, magnetic force or other coupling
    mechanism may be used to mate the sleeve 3010 with the display device 120.
[00295]     In certain embodiments, housing of the sleeve 3010 may be provided with
   processing electronics including antenna, storage device such as memory, and
    application logic and/or microprocessor for processing data and communicating with
   the on body electronics 110. Accordingly, when mated or coupled to another
   electronic device such as, for example, an in vitro glucose meter, the programmed

                                               -83
     routines and executable software stored in the sleeve 3010, for example, to
     communicate with on body electronics 110 in analyte monitoring system described
     above in conjunction with FIG. 1, glucose meter with the mated sleeve 3010 in certain
     embodiments may communicate with such devices by sharing the stored software
     routine in sleeve 3010 with one or more microprocessors of the in vitro glucose meter
     and executed or implemented by the glucose meter microprocessor(s).
 [00296] Furthermore, when the user does not wish to use the sleeve 3010, it can be
     disabled or deactivated while engaged to display device 120 or removed from the
     display device by sliding or otherwise disengaging the module 3010 from the display
     device 120, e.g., moving it in the opposite direction from the directional arrow shown in
     3012 or otherwise simply detaching the sleeve 3010 from display device 120.
 [00297] In the manner described above, in accordance with various embodiments of the
    present disclosure, discrete glucose measurements may be obtained without the need for
    lancing or performing fingerprick test for access to blood sample each time a
    measurement is desired. The analyte monitoring system described in further aspects
    may be configured to log or store glucose data monitored by the analyte sensor
    continuously over a predetermined or programmable time period, or over the life of the
    sensor without user intervention, and which data may be retrieved at a later time as
    desired. Furthermore, output indications such as audible, visual or vibratory alerts may
    be provided to inform the user of a predetermined condition or when the monitored
    glucose level deviates from a predefined acceptable range (for example, as warning
    indication of low glucose or high glucose level).
[00298] In still another aspect, the methods, devices and systems described above may be
    configured to log and store (for example, with an appropriate time stamp and other
    relevant information such as, for example, contemporaneous temperature reading)) the
    real time analyte data received from the analyte sensor, and may be configured to
    provide the real time analyte data on-demand by using, for example a device such as a
    blood glucose meter or a controller discussed above that is configured for
    communication with the on body integrated sensor and sensor electronics component.
[002991 That is, in one embodiment, real time data associated with the analyte being
   monitored is continuously or intermittently measured and stored in the integrated on
   body sensor and sensor electronics component, and upon request from another device
   such as the receiver unit or the display device 120 (operated by the user, for example)
   or any other communication enabled device such as a cellular telephone, a PDA, an

                                              -84
   internet or WiFi data network enabled smartphones, or any other suitable
   communication enabled device which may be used to receive the desired analyte data
   from the on body integrated sensor and sensor electronics component while being worn
   and used by the user. In one aspect, such communication enabled device may be
   positioned within a predetermined proximity to the integrated on body sensor and
   sensor electronics component, and when the communication enabled device is
   positioned within the predetermined proximity, the data from the integrated on body
   sensor and sensor electronics component may be provided to the communication
   enabled device. In one aspect, such data communication may include inductive
   coupling using, for example, electromagnetic fields, Zigbee protocol based
   communication, or any other suitable proximity based communication techniques. In
   this manner, glucose on-demand mode may be provided such that the information
   associated with contemporaneously monitored analyte level information is provided to
   the user on-demand from the user.
[003001 In this manner, in certain embodiments, the size and dimension of the on body
   electronics may be optimized for reduction by, for example, flexible or rigid potted or
   low pressure/low temperature overmolded circuitry that uses passive and active surface
   mount devices for securely positioning and adhering to the skin surface of the user.
   When flexible circuitry is with or in the overmold, the on body electronics may
   includes the analyte sensor and/or other physiological condition detection sensor on the
   flex circuit (or PCB). Furthermore in embodiments of the present disclosure, one or
   more printed RF antenna may be provided within the sensor electronics circuitry for RF
   communication with one or more remote devices, and further, the device operation
   and/or functionalities may be programmed or controlled using one or more a
   microprocessors, or ASICs to reduce the number of internal components.
[003011 Embodiments of the present disclosure include one or more low pressure
   molding materials that directly encapsulate the integrated circuits or the sensor
   electronic components. The thermal process entailed in the encapsulation using the low
   pressure molding materials may be configured to shield temperature sensitive
   components such as, for example, the analyte sensor or other components of the sensor
   electronics from the heat generated during the thermal overmolding process. Other
   techniques such as injection molding and/or potting may be used.
[00302] In another aspect, the sensor electronics may be molded using optical techniques
   such as with a UV cured material, for example, or using two photon absorption

                                               -85
   materials, which may also be used to reduce the dead or unused volume surrounding the
   sensor electronics within the housing of the device such that the reduction of its size
   and dimension may be achieved. Moreover, the sensor electronics may be configured
   to reduce the number of components used, for example, by the inclusion of an ASIC
   that may be configured to perform the one or more functions of discrete components
   such as a potentiostat, data processing/storage, thermocouple/thermister, RF
   communication data packet generator, and the like. Additionally, a field programmable
   gate array (FPGA) or any other suitable devices may be used in addition to the ASIC in
   the sensor electronics to reduce the on body electronics dimension.
[003031 Also, embodiments of the present disclosure includes analyte sensors that may be
   fabricated from flex circuits and integrated with the sensor electronics within the device
   housing, as a single integrated device. Example of flex circuits may include evaporated
   or sputtered gold on polyester layer, single or multi-layer copper or gold on polymide
   flex circuit. When the sensor fabricated from a copper or gold polymide flex circuit,
   gold or other inert material may be selectively plated on the implantable portion of the
   circuit to minimize the corrosion of the copper. In certain embodiments, the flex circuit
   may be die or laser cut, or alternatively chemically milled to define the sensor from the
   flex circuit roll.
[003041 A further configuration of embodiments of the present disclosure includes RF
   communication module provided on the flex circuit instead of as a separate component
   in the on body electronics. For example, the RF antenna may be provided directly on
   the flex circuit by, such as surrounding the on body electronics components within the
   housing on the flex circuit, or folded over the components, and encapsulated with the
   electronic components within the housing of the on body electronics.
[00305] In one aspect, the integrated assembly including the on body electronics and the
   insertion device may be sterilized and packaged as one single device and provided to
   the user. Furthermore, during manufacturing, the insertion device assembly may be
   terminal packaged providing cost savings and avoiding the use of, for example, costly
   thermoformed tray or foil seal. In addition, the insertion device may include an end cap
   that is rotatably coupled to the insertion device body, and which provides a safe and
   sterile environment (and avoid the use of desiccants for the sensor) for the sensor
   provided within the insertion device along with the integrated assembly. Also, the
   insertion device sealed with the end cap may be configured to retain the sensor within
   the housing from significant movement during shipping such that the sensor position

                                             -86
   relative to the integrated assembly and the insertion device is maintained from
   manufacturing, assembly and shipping, until the device is ready for use by the user.
[00306] In certain embodiments, an integrated analyte monitoring device assembly
   comprises an analyte sensor for transcutaneous positioning through a skin layer and
   maintained in fluid contact with an ISF under the skin layer during a predetermined
   time period. The analyte sensor includes a proximal portion and a distal portion. The
   integrated analyte monitoring device assembly includes on body electronics coupled to
   the analyte sensor, the on body electronics comprising a circuit board having a
   conductive layer and a sensor antenna disposed on the conductive layer, one or more
   electrical contacts provided on the PCB and coupled with the proximal portion of the
   analyte sensor to maintain continuous electrical communication, and a data processing
   component provided on the circuit board and in signal communication with the analyte
   sensor. The data processing component may be configured to execute one or more
   routines for processing signals received from the analyte sensor, and to control the
   transmission of data associated with the processed signals received from the analyte
   sensor to a remote location using the sensor antenna in response to a request signal
   received from the remote location.
