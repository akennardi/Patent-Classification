                                        DESCRIPTION
         INVOICE ISSUING SYSTEM AND INVOICE                            ISSUING METHOD
Technical Field
 [0001]          The present           invention         relates        to  a  system and       a
method for invoicing a gas                   fee.
Background Art
 [0002]           It   is   known that       LP gas is         supplied by gas imported
from gas-producing countries and gas as a byproduct of domestic
process of petroleum oil                products.          An import base for storing
LP gas transferred             from gas-producing countries by a tanker and
a petroleum oil           purification         base are referred             to as a primary
base.      LP gas is      loaded from the primarybase to domestic vessels
or tank trucks and is              shipped to a secondary base that                 is   located
at a coast or an inland and that                    functions as a supply base for
LP gas transportation.                 The LP gas transported to the secondary
base is    transported to an LP gas filling                     station     at each location
 (i.e.,    a delivery base) and is               filled        into a gas cylinder          (gas
bottle) at a delivery base.
 [0003]          The gas cylinders filled                   at the respective filling
stations are delivered by a deliveryman to a customer's home
 (e.g., a standard home, collective housing, or office).                                      An
empty gas cylinder of the customer's home is                               exchanged with a
filled     gas cylinder and the empty gas cylinder is                           collected     to
a filling      station.           Each filling        station         has a fixed delivery
                                              -  1 -

area for which a deliveryman is responsible.                                 A deliveryman
receives delivery slips              corresponding to 2 to 10 days showing
delivery       destinations           to     which       gas      cylinders       should   be
delivered to customer's homes within the delivery area.
[0004]          A delivery slip           is    prepared by a delivery manager.
First,      with    regard      to  each       customer,         the   amount     of  LP  gas
remaining in the gas cylinder is predicted based on the past
gas     usage,     the    meter     indication           of    the    gas    meter    of  the
customer's home,          and the actually-delivered                  number.      Then,  the
next      delivery     due      date   of      gas    cylinder(s)         is    determined.
Integration       is  carried      out for all      customers within the delivery
area for which the deliveryman is                    responsible to determine the
delivery amount of gas cylinders corresponding to 2 to 10 days.
[00051          After the deliveryman exchanges                         the gas     cylinder
with the new one based on the delivery slip, the deliveryman
writes, into a delivery slip, the respective items of a date
of exchange,         the meter indication of the exchange date,                           the
cylinder number, and the                 safety inspection.                When the daily
delivery operation is            completed, the delivery slip                  is  submitted
to the delivery manager.                  The delivery slip returned to the
delivery      manager        is   checked       for    an    incomplete        form by    the
delivery manager and is subsequently stored as data used to
calculate       the    next      delivery        due    date.        A   system     has  been
suggested to provide an efficient delivery of gas cylinders
under a system as described above                      (see Patent Publication 1).
[00061          As disclosed in           Patent Publication 1,                a system for
an efficient         gas     cylinder      delivery         has    been    conventionally
                                             -   2 -

provided.     However,     there have been no system that              can charge
a gas fee based on the execution of a gas meter reading together
with an unpaid gas fee for which a predetermined period has
already passed since the previous charge.
 [0007]       Generally,      it  is known to charge a gas fee by a handy
terminal that does not include a communication function.                         In
this  case however,    it   was required to check whether or not there
is an unpaid gas fee by using a computer terminal other than
the   handy  terminal      to    inquire     of    a  server  for   the   payment
situation at the time.            Furthermore, even when the computer
terminal is    used for an inquiry,          the payment situation        must be
always updated.       Therefore,       if    the     inquiry  timing does       not
concur with the charge timing,            incorrect      charge details     may be
issued.

according to one embodiment of the                        invention.         In Fig.         1, a
delivery server           (invoice issuing system) 101 is                   configured to
communicate, via a network 102,                      with a plurality of payment
computers 103a and 103b,               - - -,  103n.        This delivery server 101
is     configured       to     communicate,          via    a  network        104,       with     a
plurality       of mobile terminals            (communication terminals)                    105a,
105b,      --- ,   105n.        Hereinafter        the     respective        plurality          of
payment computers 103a to 103n will                       be collectively             referred
to     as  a  payment       computer      103.        Hereinafter         the    respective
plurality        of plurality        of mobile terminals             105a to 105n will
be collectively referred to as a mobile terminal 105.
                                             -  6 -

 [0016]          The payment computer 103 is,          for example,      a computer
for performing a gas fee payment for example and includes a CPU
and a storage device           (not shown) .     This payment computer             103
is   connected to a delivery server 101 and notifies                 the delivery
server 101 of the payment situation            determined based on whether
the payment is made or not.               The payment types          include, for
example,      payment using a bill        at a convenience store           or a post
office,     an automatic bank debit through a bank account, payment
by a credit card, or an on-line electronic payment.
 [0017]          The mobile terminal 105 is           a terminal that         is  used
by a meter reader to confirm the meter indication                  of a gas meter
attached to a piece           of  supply facility equipped with a gas
cylinder and that         includes,   for example,        CPU,  memory,      an input
device, and a display device.               The meter reader collects the
indication       data including the meter indication             of the gas meter
via the mobile terminal 105 to send the data to the delivery
server 101.
 [0018]
 [Delivery server configuration]
          Fig.   2  is  a   block   diagram    illustrating         an    exemplary
configuration of the delivery server 101.                      In Fig. 2, a case
will be described in which a single computer system is used.
However,       there also may be a case in        which the delivery server
101 is     configured as a part       of a multi-functional           distributed
system comprising a plurality of computer systems.
 [0019]          As shown in    Fig. 2,   the delivery server 101 includes
a CPU 301, a system bus 302, a RAM 303, an input device 304,
                                        -7   -

an output device 305, a communication controller 306,                        and a
storage device           (management unit) 307.
 [0020]         The CPU 301 is          coupled to the respective components
via the systembus 302 to perform a process to transmit a control
signal or data and to execute various software programs for the
operation of the entire delivery server 101 and calculation
process for example.
 [0021]         The RAM 303 includes awork area to temporarily store
data and a software program.
 [0022]         The      storage         device     307   is  configured     by   a
non-volatile        storage medium such as ROM or HDD and includes a
program storage area for storing                  a software program and a data
storage area for storing data of continuously-stored data or
processing result data for example.                     For example, a software
program for example is              read out from the program storage area
of the storage device 307 to the work area of the RAM 303 and
the software program is carried out by the CPU 301,                        thereby
allowing the CPU 301 of this              embodiment to execute the functions
of the respective parts            31 to 35 (whichwill be described later).
 [0023]         The CPU 301 includes, as shown in             Fig. 2,  a receiving
unit     31, a calculation         unit    32,  a payment situation     check unit
33,     an issuing unit 34,             and a transmission unit 35.
 [0024]         The     receiving        unit    31  receives     from the  mobile
terminal 105 a gas meter reading process request for a meter
reading target.            In this    embodiment,      the meter reading process
request is     performed using indication               data including the meter
indication      showing a gas usage based on a gas cylinder and the
                                             - 8 -

meter reading date for example.                The details         of the indication
data will be described later.
 [0025]        The calculation       unit      32 performs the meter reading
process according to the above-described request to calculate
the gas fee of a customer based on the meter reading in the
current month.
 [0026]        The calculation       unit      32 performs the meter reading
process by performing, for example, the calculation of {(the
meter indication      on the current meter reading date)                  -  (the meter
indication on the previous meter reading date)} to calculate
the gas usage in      a period from the previous meter reading date
to the current meter reading date.                   After the calculation of
the gas usage,     the calculation           unit    32 calculates,         based on a
predetermined calculating            formula       (e.g.,       (basic fee)     +   (unit
fee)   x  (gas usage)),        the gas fee for a customer based on the
meter reading in      the current month.             Specifically,         the gas fee
for the customer based on the meter reading in                     the current month
is,  for example,     the gas fee for the gas usage in                  a period from
the previous meter reading date to the current meter reading
date.    The above-described method of calculating the gas fee
is   not   limited    to    the   above-described             example     and    can   be
performed from various points of view.
 [0027]        The payment situation            check unit       33 confirms,      based
on the payment situation         of the storage device (management unit)
307 for managing the gas fee payment situation                     for the customer,

The payment situation managed by the storage device 307 will
be described in detail later.
 [0028]          When the check by the payment situation                          check unit
33 shows that       the gas fee is           unpaid,     then the payment situation
check unit       33 reads the unpaid gas fee from the storage device
307.
 [0029]          The    issuing        unit     34   issues        invoice     information
including the gas fee based on the meter reading in                             the current
month calculated           by the calculation             unit    32 and the unpaid gas
fee read by the payment situation check unit 33.
 [00301          The transmission unit 35 transmits, to the mobile
terminal 105,       the invoice information issued by the issuing unit
34.       The invoice information includes the gas fee based on the
meter reading in          the current month for example and the details
thereof will be described later.
 [0031]          Fig.     3 illustrates an exemplary configuration of
customer information d30 stored in the storage device 307 of
the delivery server 101.                As shown in        Fig. 3,    the storage device
307      stores   therein        a    "customer       ID"      d31   for   identifying         a
customer,       a "meter number" d32 for identifying                     a gas meter,       and
a "gas cylinder capacity" d33 for example.
 [0032]          Fig.      4A    and    Fig.      4B   illustrate         an    example      of
information including the customer payment situation                                stored in
the storage device 307                 of the delivery server 101.                     Fig.  4A
illustrates       a table     storing       the gas fee payment situation.                Fig.
                                              -  10  -

4B     illustrates            a   table    storing          the  gas   appliance    payment
situation.
 [00331               The      table      d40A        of      Fig.    4A    includes     the
above-described                "customer     ID" d41,         the "meter reading month"
d42,       the "gas fee" d43, and the "payment situation" d44.                            In
one example of the table                 d40A of Fig. 4A,          a customer identified
by the customer ID "AO01" is set to have "3500 yen" as a gas
fee corresponding to the current month in                          "January" and a record
is provided to show that this gas fee is already "paid".                                  By
this      configuration, whether each customer has paid each gas fee
based on the meter reading in the current month is managed.
 [0034]               The table     d50 of Fig. 4B includes the above-described
"customer            ID"     d51,    the   "gas       appliance      cost"   d52,  and   the
"payment           situation"         d53.     The     gas     appliances     include,   for
example,          a gas cooking appliance,                  a gas heater,    and a gas fan
heater.
 [00351               In   one example of the table               of Fig.   4B, a customer
having the customer ID "AO01"                      is   set    to have the gas appliance
cost of "3600" yen and a record is provided to show that this
cost        is     "unpaid".          Thus,     the     gas     appliance    cost   payment
situation           including the customer payment situation                    is managed.
 [00361               The "payment situations" d44 and d53 in the table
of Fig. 4A or Fig. 4B are set to be                            "paid" when the delivery
server 101 receives notification                       from the payment computer 103.
Specifically, the payment computer 103 sends to the delivery
server 101,            after    performing the payment of the gas fee or the
gas appliance cost, information for notifying                            the payment (e.g.,
                                                -   11    -

the customer ID,           the payment date,        the meter reading month for
the paid gas fee,           or the gas appliance cost) .               As a result,      the
delivery       server        101   changes       the      corresponding          "payment
situations" d44 and d53 in the tables d40 and d50 of Fig. 4A
or Fig. 4B from "unpaid" to "paid".

[Operation of delivery server]
          Next, the      following section will describe                    a method of
invoicing a gas fee when a gas meter reading is                       performed.        Fig.
5 is    a flowchart illustrating          an example of the entire              operation
of the delivery server 101.                 Fig.    6 illustrates         an example of
the indication data of the gas meter.                         Fig. 7 illustrates an
exemplary configuration of a plurality                      of pieces of indication
data stored in the storage device 307 of the distribution                            server
101.       Fig. 8 illustrates an example of an invoice.
[0038]          In Fig. 5, when the mobile terminal 105 firstly                        sends
a gas meter reading process request for a meter reading target
to the delivery server 101.               Then, the request is received by
the CPU301 (receivingunit              31) ofthe      delivery server101              (SlOl).
This request is         performed,     as shown in        Fig.    6,  using indication
data including a meter reading slip                    ID d61,       an area code d62,
a meter reader ID d63,            a meter reading date d64,               a customer ID
d65,     a meter number d66,       and a meter indication              d67 for example.
[0039]          In    this     embodiment,      the     gas     meter has      a    QR code
 (registered trademark)             (readable information code) attached
thereto.       Thus, the mobile terminal 105 can read the QR code
 (registered       trademark)       to  acquire       the      respective      pieces     of
                                          -  12   -

indication          data except for the meter indication                  and the meter
reading date.              The meter indication         shown in    Fig.   6 is  acquired
based on an input operation of a meter reader for example and
the meter reading date is                 a date on which the QR code (registered
trademark) is read for example.
 [0040]             When the CPU 301          (receiving unit     31) of the delivery
server 101 receives from the mobile terminal 105 the request
using the indication                 data on the meter reading date,             then the
CPU 301 stores             the indication        data in   the storage device 307.
This exemplary storage is                    shown in Fig. 7.         As shown in Fig.
7,   the database d70 in             the storage device 307 stores           a plurality
of pieces of indication data received by the CPU 301.
 [0041]             Upon receiving the above-described request,                    the CPU
301     (calculation           unit   32)   of the delivery server 101 performs
a meter reading process according to the request to calculate
the gas fee for the customer based on the meter reading in                               the
current month              (S102).
 [0042]              In   this      meter   reading    process,     the gas     usage     is
calculated based on the indication data on the current meter
reading date            (e.g.,      March 30)    used in   the request in        S101 and
the indication            data used in       the request received on the previous
meter reading date (e.g.,                  February 28).      The storage device 307
stores       the indication           data on the previous meter reading date
 (Fig.     7).      Thus,      the CPU 301 reads       the indication        data on the
previous meter reading date from the storage device 307.
 [0043]             The meter reading process in             S102 is     performed,      for
example,        by performing           { (the meter indication         included in      the
                                               - 13  -

indication       data on the current meter reading date)                   - (the meter
indication       included in     the indication          data on the previous meter
reading date)} to calculate the gas usage corresponding to a
period from the previous meter reading date to the current meter
reading date.         Based on the gas usage,               the CPU 301 calculates
the gas fee for the customer based on the meter reading in                           the
current month.         In this    embodiment,          the gas fee for the customer
based on the meter reading in the current month is set to be
an amount calculated,           for example,          based on a formula of (basic
fee     )+(unit fee)x(gas usage)              (e.g., 5000yen).
 [0044]          Furthermore,       in  S103 of Fig.        5,   the CPU 301 (payment
situation       check unit     33)    of the delivery server 101 refers               to
the     table    of  Fig.    4A   for example           to  determine     whether    the
customer has an unpaid fee or not.                      With reference to Fig.       4A,
the customer identified            by the customer ID A001 has two months
worth of unpaid gas fee.               Thus,   this      customer is    determined as
having an unpaid fee            ("Yes"     in   S103) .      In   this  case,   the CPU
301 reads from the table           of Fig. 4A the unpaid fee corresponding
to the customer          ID   (e.g., 4000yen)            (S104).
 [0045]          Furthermore, in the process to determine whether
there is      anunpaid fee in S103, the CPU 301 (thepayment situation
check unit      33) also may refer        to the table         of Fig. 4B for example
to determine whether the customer has an unpaid fee                               (or an
unpaid gas appliance cost) or not.                      With reference to Fig.       4B,
the customer identified             by the customer ID A001 has an unpaid
gas appliance cost           of 3600yen.          Thus,     the CPU 301       reads  the
unpaid cost (e.g.,          3600 yen)      from the table          of Fig.   4B (S104)
                                          -   14    -

When there is       no unpaid fee in              the determination in                  S103   ("No"
in S103,     then the process proceeds from S103 to S105.
 [0046]        Next,      the CPU 301           (issuing unit          34)    of the delivery
server issues the invoice information including the gas                                          fee
calculated in S102 based on the meter reading in the current
month     (e.g., 5000yen),         and the read unpaid fee in                         S104    (e.g.,
4000yen).        Furthermore,           in      this      embodiment,           since      the   gas
appliance cost of 3600yen is unpaid for example, the CPU 301
causes     the   invoice        information            to     include       this       unpaid    gas
appliance cost.
 [0047]         Then,     the CPU 301 (transmission unit                        35)     sends this
invoice information to the mobile terminal 105                                      (S106).
 [0048]        When        the     mobile            terminal         105        receives        the
above-described invoice information, the mobile terminal 105
instructs     a printer        (not shown) for example to print                         an invoice
based on this       information            (S107) .         As a result,          the printer       1
is   caused,    as illustrated           in     Fig.      8,   to print       the invoice 200
including the gas usage notice 201 showing the meter reading
details and the gas fee payment slip 202.                                In the example of
the meter reading details              201 of Fig.            8,  the total       billed     amount
dl    (=d2+d3)   is   printed      that      is     obtained by adding the gas fee
dl corresponding to the gas usage (in                        this   embodiment,          the total
of dl=the gas        fee corresponding to the meter reading in the
current month (e.g.,           5000yen) + the unpaid gas fee corresponding
to the previous month meter reading                             (e.g., 4000yen))            and the
unpaid gas appliance cost d2                       (e.g., 5000yen)).
                                              -    15   -

[0049]         In the example of the gas fee bill 202 of Fig. 8,
the gas fee bill       202 includes the above-described billed                     amount
dl   and  a   barcode       203   and      is    printed         based    on   a   format
corresponding          to   available          previously-specified              payment
methods   (payment at a convenience store                      or at a post office).
In  this  case,      the previously-specified                   payment    methods      are
stored in     the storage device              307   to be associated with the
customer ID.       In the process of S105 of Fig.                   5 to issue invoice
information, the CPU 301 reads the payment method corresponding
to the customer ID to issue invoice information including the
payment method.         As described above,            an operation is        performed
to issue an invoice regarding the gas fee or the gas appliance.
[00501        As described above, during the gas meter reading,
the delivery server 101 of this               embodiment sends,           to the mobile
terminal 105,       the invoice information including the current
month meter reading and the unpaid gas fee.                            Thus, the meter
reading operation and the invoicing operation can be performed
simultaneously,          thus   achieving         an     efficient        operation      to
invoice a gas fee including an unpaid gas                           fee.
[0051]         Furthermore,      since the invoice information includes
an unpaid gas appliance cost also, an invoicing operation to
customers can be carried out more efficiently.
[0052]       As described above,          an embodiment has been described.
However,    a specific      data structure           for example is         not limited
to the embodiment and also may be changed.                        For example,    in  S104
of Fig.  5,   an example was shown in               which an unpaid fee is            read
when such an unpaid fee exists.                However,       another configuration
                                        -     16  -

also may be used in which an unpaid fee is read only when an
unpaid period is       longer than a predetermined period (e.g.,                        one
week has passed since the payment deadline).
 [0053]         A  case     was   described         in    which     the   invoice       200
included      the  meter       reading    details         201   and   the     bill     202.
However, the invoice 200 may be printed in arbitrary layout,
format, and contents so long as customers can be notified of
the gas fee charge details           generated during a gas meter reading
that    include the gas fee based on the meter reading in the current
month and the unpaid gas fee.               For example,          the meter reading
details     201 and the bill       202 may be printed            separately so that
only the bill 202 is handled as the invoice 200.
 [0054]         Throughout this       specification            and the claims which
follow,      unless    the      context     requires         otherwise,         the    word
"comprise",      and variations      such as "comprises" and "comprising",
will    be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated                           integer

                                  CLAIMS
1.    A gas fee invoice issuing system including gas meters
which individually    indicate    usage of gas of each customer having
their own customer ID, each of the gas meters having a meter
ID, the system comprising:
      a delivery server, which is connected to a network,
including a receiving unit, a calculation unit, a management
unit, a payment situation check unit, an issuing unit, and a
transmission unit,
      a plurality of communication terminals communicably
connected to the delivery server through the network;                   and
      a payment computer, which is communicably connected to
the delivery server through the network, for notifying
information on payment of the customers to the delivery server,
wherein
      the receiving unit,      from at least  one of the communication
terminals, receives:
               first-indication data of each of the gas meters
including the customer ID linked to the gas meter ID,                 a first
date on which an indication        of the gas meter is     retrieved,       and
a first indication which is the indication of the gas meter
retrieved on the first date;
               second-indication data of each of the gas meters
including the customer ID,        the gas meter ID,      a second date on
which an indication     of the gas meter is    retrieved      in   next month
of the first date, and a second indication which is the
                                   - 19  -

indication of the gas meter retrieved on the second date; and
            third-indication data of each of the gas meters
including the customer ID, the gas meter ID, a third date on
which an indication of the gas meter is retrieved in next month
of the second date, and a third indication which is the
indication of the gas meter retrieved on the third date,
      the calculation unit calculates:
            a first gas fee based on a first usage, which is
consumed amount of the gas in a period between the first              date
and the second date, by comparing between the first            indication
and the second indication belonging to the same customer ID and
the same meter ID included in the first-indication         data received
by the receiving unit; and
      the management unit stores information on:
            the first  gas fee calculated by the calculation unit;
            a gas-appliance      cost,   which     is   a cost   of a  gas
appliance   purchased    by   the   customer,         linking   with   the
corresponding customer ID; and
            payment situation indicating whether at least one
of the first gas fee and the gas-appliance cost have already
been paid based on a payment notification received from the
payment computer through the network,
      the payment situation check unit checks on whether at
least one of the first    gas fee and the gas appliance cost have
already been paid on the third date,
      the issuing unit, on the third date, generates invoice
information including the second gas fee and further including
                               -  20 -

at    least     one of unpaid portion of the first       gas fee and unpaid
portion         of  the gas  appliance      cost  checked   by    the  payment
situation check unit, and
            the transmission unit, on the third date, transmits to
the        corresponding     communication        terminal,     the    invoice
information generated by the issuing unit.
2.         The invoice issuing system according to claim 1,           wherein:
            the management unit    stores    the customer's preference       in
terms of payment method, and
            the   communication   terminal,      which is   connected     to   a
printing        device, is  configured to instruct     the printing     device
to print        an invoice of which format complies with the payment
method stored in the management unit when the communication
terminal receives the invoice information from the transmission
unit.
