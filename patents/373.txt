   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            The present invention relates generally to a method of diagnosing, prognosing or
 5 monitoring the development or progress of metastatic cancer, more particularly bone
   metastatic cancer. The method of the present invention more particularly provides a method
   for detecting metastatic cancer, or a predisposition thereto, by screening for the differential
   expression of a panel of genes which comprise an IRF7 binding site. In a related aspect, the
   present invention provides a method of therapeutically or prophylactically treating metastatic
10 cancer, in particular bone metastatic cancer. More particularly, the present invention provides
   a means of therapeutically or prophylactically treating metastatic cancer by upregulating type I
   IFN levels.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
15          The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived
   from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as an
   acknowledgment or admission or any form of suggestion that that prior publication (or
   information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general knowledge in
   the field of endeavour to which this specification relates.
20          Bibliographic details of the publications referred to by author in this specification are
   collected alphabetically at the end of the description.
            A neoplasm is an abnormal mass or colony of cells produced by a relatively
   autonomous new growth of tissue. Most neoplasms arise from the clonal expansion of a single
   cell that has undergone neoplastic transformation. The transformation of a normal cell to a
25 neoplastic cell can be caused by a chemical, physical, or biological agent (or event) that alters
   the cell genome. Neoplastic cells are characterized by the loss of some specialized functions
   and the acquisition of new biological properties, foremost, the property of relatively
   autonomous growth. They pass on their heritable biological characteristics to progeny cells.
   Neoplasms may originate in almost any tissue containing cells capable of mitotic division.
30          The past, present, and future predicted biological behaviour, or clinical course, of a
   neoplasm is further classified as benign or malignant, a distinction of great importance in
   diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. A malignant neoplasm manifests a greater degree of
   autonomy, is capable of invasion and metastatic spread, may be resistant to treatment, and may

                                                   -2
   cause death. A benign neoplasm, however, exhibits a lesser degree of autonomy, is usually not
   invasive and does not metastasize. Cancer is second only to heart disease as the most common
   cause of death in western countries. The estimated incidence of cancer in the US, for example,
   is about 1 x 106 new cases annually. Nearly 80% of all malignant neoplasms arise in 10
 5 anatomical sites, namely lung, breast, colon and rectum, prostate, lymph nodes, uterus,
   bladder, pancreas, blood and stomach.
           Metastatic tumours are very common in the late stages of cancer. The spread of
   metastases may occur via the blood, the lymphatics or through both routes, with the most
   common places for metastases to arise being the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, brain and the
10 bones.
            There is a propensity for certain tumours to seed in particular organs. This was first
   discussed as the "seed and soil" theory by Stephen Paget over a century ago in 1889. For
   example, prostate cancer usually metastasises to the bones. In a similar manner, colon cancer
   has a tendency to metastasise to the liver while in women, stomach cancer often metastasises
15 to the ovary. According to the "seed and soil" theory, it is difficult for cancer cells to survive
   outside their region of origin, so in order to metastasise they must find a location with similar
   characteristics. For example, breast tumour cells, which gather calcium ions from breast milk,
   metastasise to bone tissue, where they can gather calcium ions from bone. Malignant
   melanoma spreads to the brain, presumably because neural tissue and melanocytes arise from
20 the same cell line in the embryo.
           Metastasis involves a complex series of steps in which cancer cells leave the original
   tumour site and migrate to other parts of the body via the bloodstream or the lymphatic system.
   To do so, malignant cells break away from the primary tumour and attach to and degrade
   proteins that make up the surrounding extracellular matrix, which separates the tumour from
25 adjoining tissue. By degrading these proteins, cancer cells are able to breach the extracellular
   matrix and escape.
            The body resists metastasis by a variety of mechanisms through the actions of a class
   of proteins known as metastasis suppressors, of which about a dozen are known. It has also
   been determined that one of the critical events required is the growth of a new network of
30 blood vessels, that is tumour angiogenesis. Significant research has therefore focussed on
   angiogenesis inhibitors as a means to prevent the growth of metastases. Despite these findings,
   however, the effective treatment of metastatic cancer has been elusive and largely still relies on
   the application of very non-specific and highly toxic chemotherapy based methods.

                                                       -3
            Equally elusive has been the development of a method for the early diagnosis of
   metastatic cancer. Where metastatic cancer is found at the same time as the primary tumour,
   often in the context of surgery, the prognosis for the patient is usually very poor due to the
   advanced stage of disease. However, in patients with either an advanced stage but non
 5 metastasised primary tumour or those in whom metastasis has only just commenced,
   confirmation of metastatic cancer can be virtually impossible to make due to the limitations of
   current diagnostic techniques. In these patients the primary tumour will be removed and the
   patient may nevertheless be subjected to a full course of chemotherapy in the hope that this
   will be effective to kill any metastatic tumours which may be present. However, in the
10 absence of having positively identified any such tumours it is difficult to assess the necessity
   of this treatment regime. A still further complicating factor is that not all primary tumours will
   necessarily metastasise and it is virtually impossible, based just on histological analysis, to
   predict which tumours will metastasise and which will not. In other situations, there will be no
   chemotherapy provided for possible metastases and if these in fact exist, they will ultimately
15 not be identified until it is virtually too late for effective treatment.
             To this end, there is a significant need to develop means of accurately determining the
   likelihood of a primary tumour becoming metastatic. The current histology based analysis of
   primary tumours is highly subjective and not all that accurate. The development of a means to
   reliably and routinely assess a patient presenting with a primary tumour, to determine the
20 likelihood of the onset of metastatic cancer, is therefore highly desirable.
            In work leading up to the present invention, a molecular signature has been identified
   which, if present in a primary tumour, is characteristic of the propensity of that tumour to
   metastasise. Specifically, downregulation in a tumour of the level of expression of genes
   which comprise an IRF7 binding site, relative to the levels present in a non-metastatic tumour,
25 is indicative of the presence of a metastatic phenotype. This finding has therefore now
   provided a sensitive and reliable means to identify tumours which have, or are likely to,
   metastasise. This information in relation to the classification of the tumour can then inform the
   development of the therapeutic treatment and ongoing monitoring which is appropriate for the
   patient.
30           Still further, this finding has also facilitated the development of a method for
   therapeutically or prophylactically treating metastatic cancer based on upregulating the levels
   of Type I interferon in patients diagnosed with primary tumours exhibiting reduced expression
   levels of the subject gene signature.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
            The present invention is predicated, in part, on the determination both that the loss of
15 IRF7 gene functionality in a tumour induces a shift to a metastatic phenotype and, further, that
   this loss of functionality is routinely identifiable by virtue of the presence of a unique gene
   signature in the tumour, this signature being a downregulation in the level of expression of one
   or more genes comprising an IRF7 binding site in their promoter. This finding has facilitated
   not only the development of a method for screening a tumour to determine its propensity to
20 metastasise, but has also led to the development of a means of therapeutically or
   prophylactically treating patients presenting with a primary tumour which exhibits a metastatic
   phenotype, said method being based on upregulating levels of Type 1 IFN in the patient.
            Accordingly, in one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of
   assessing the metastatic status of a tumour from an individual, said method comprising
25 detecting the expression of one or more genes by said tumour, which genes comprise an IRF7
   binding site in their promoter, wherein a decreased level of expression of said genes relative to
   the level of expression of said genes in a corresponding non-metastatic tumour is indicative of
   the metastatic phenotype of said tumour.
            More particularly, there is provided a method of assessing the metastatic status of a
30 tumour from an individual, said method comprising detecting the expression of one or more
   genes, of Table 1, by said tumour wherein a decreased level of expression of said genes
   relative to the level of expression of said genes in a corresponding non-metastatic tumour is
   indicative of the metastatic phenotype of said tumour.

                                                      - 12
             In a related aspect there is provided a method of assessing the metastatic status of a
   tumour from an individual, said method comprising detecting the functional level of IRF7,
   IRF9 or STAT 1 in said tumour wherein a decrease in the functional level of said IRF7, IRF9 or
   STAT 1 relative to the level of expression of said genes in a corresponding non-metastatic
 5 tumour is indicative of the metastatic phenotype of said tumour.
             The term "tumour" is used herein to describe an abnormal mass or growth of cells or
   tissue that is characterized by uncontrolled cell division. Tumours may be benign (not
   cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Tumours may be identified, monitored or assessed
   through clinical screening or diagnostic procedures, including, but not limited to, palpation,
10 biopsy, cell proliferation index, endoscopy, mammography, digital mammography,
   ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron
   emission tomography (PET), radiography, radionuclide evaluation, CT- or MRI-guided
   aspiration cytology, and imaging-guided needle biopsy, among others. Such diagnostic
   techniques are well known to those skilled in the art.
15           More particularly, said tumour is a primary tumour.
             Reference to the "metastatic phenotype" of a tumour should be understood as a
   reference to the capacity of the cells of the subject tumour to spread from the organ or tissue of
   origin to another organ or tissue, typically via the lymphatics or the blood circulation. It
   should also be understood that the subject cells, although exhibiting a metastatic phenotype,
20 may or may not have actually travelled to another organ in the patient in whom the tumour has
   developed. To this end, not only will the existence of advanced stage metastatisation be
   detected by the method of the present invention but, of more significance, very early stage
   metastatisation (where the metastases may be few in number and small in size and therefore
   difficult to detect by currently used methods) or where the primary tumour has transitioned to a
25 metastatic phenotype but the cells of which have not yet actually travelled to another organ
   (this is likely to reflect a relatively brief period of time). Without limiting the present
   invention to any one theory or mode of action, the downregulation of IRF7 functionality is
   understood to be the trigger for a shift to a metastatic phenotype. Accordingly, this will occur
   prior to the tumour cells entering the circulation and seeding other organs. By identifying
30 individuals who are either in the very early stages of metastatic disease or who are about to
   undergo metastatic seeding of distant organs, there is provided the possibility of more
   appropriate therapeutic intervention than might otherwise have been deemed necessary had the
   metastatic phenotype not been diagnosable. In this regard, reference to metastatic "status"

                                                    - 13
   should be understood to mean that the tumour is assessed to determine whether or not it
   exhibits a metastatic phenotype.
            Without limiting the present invention in any way, in one embodiment it has been
   determined that the subject method is particularly effective in detecting the metastatic
 5 phenotype of tumours which exhibit a predisposition to metastasising to the bone. This is an
   extremely valuable finding since bone metastases are generally regarded as particularly
   aggressive and difficult to treat. Accordingly, developing a means to identify tumours
   exhibiting a metastatic phenotype provides a mechanism of potentially identifying these bone
   metastases at a much earlier stage than is currently possible. This may then significantly
10 improve the prognostic outcome for the patient.
            According to this embodiment, there is provided a method of assessing the metastatic
   status of a tumour from an individual, said method comprising detecting the expression of one
   or more genes of Table 1 by said tumour wherein a decreased level of expression of said genes
   relative to the level of expression of said genes in a corresponding non-metastatic tumour is
15 indicative of the metastatic phenotype of said tumour and wherein the metastases are bone
   metastases.
            In a related embodiment there is provided a method of assessing the metastatic status
   of a tumour from an individual said method comprising detecting the functional level of IRF7,
   IRF9 or STAT 1 in said tumour wherein a decrease in the functional level of said IRF7, IRF9 or
20 STAT 1 is indicative of the metastatic phenotype of said tumour and wherein the metastases are
   bone metastases.
            Still without limiting the present invention in any way, the most common sites of
   cancer metastases are the lungs, bone and liver. Although most cancers have the ability to
   spread to many different parts of the body, they will often spread to one site more often than
25 others. Listed below are the three most common sites for metastases, excluding lymph nodes,
   for several types of cancer:
             Cancer Type              Main sites of metastasis
             Breast                   Lungs, liver, bones
             Colon                    Liver, peritoneum, lungs
             Kidney                   Lungs, liver, bones
             Lungs                    Adrenal gland, liver lungs

              Uterus                   Liver, lungs, peritoneum
            In one embodiment, said tumour is a tumour of the breast, colon, kidney, lungs, skin,
   ovary, pancreas, prostate, rectum, stomach, thyroid or uterus.
            In another embodiment there is provided a method of assessing the metastatic status of
 5 a breast, kidney or prostate tumour from an individual, said method comprising detecting the
   expression of one or more genes of Table 1 by said tumour wherein a decreased level of
   expression of said genes relative to the level of expression of said genes in a corresponding
   non-metastatic tumour is indicative of the metastatic phenotype of said tumour.
            In a related embodiment there is provided a method of assessing the metastatic status
10 of a breast, kidney or prostate tumour from an individual, said method comprising detecting
   the functional level of IRF7, IRF9 or STAT 1 in said tumour wherein a decrease in the
   functional level of said IRF7, IRF9 or STAT 1 relative to the level of expression in a
   corresponding non-metastatic tumour is indicative of the metastatic phenotype of said breast,
   kidney or prostate tumour.
15          It should be understood that the method of the present invention does not conclusively
   identify the site or likely site of metastases. However, the positive diagnosis of a metastatic
   phenotype does enable one to then design an appropriate monitoring and treatment regime to
   deal with the patient's transition to metastatic cancer.
            As detailed hereinbefore, the present invention is predicated on the unexpected
20 determination that a loss of the functionality of the transcription factor IRF7 in tumour cells
   results in the transition of these tumour cells to a metastatic phenotype. Without limiting the
   present invention to any one theory or mode of action interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are a
   family of transcription factors with diverse functions which include host defense, cell cycle
   regulation, apoptosis, oncogenesis, and immune cell development and homeostasis. Currently,
25 there are 10 members of the mammalian IRF family (IRFs 1 to 10), all of which contain a

                                                    - 15
   conserved DNA binding domain. The DNA binding domain is located at the amino termini of
   the IRFs and consists of a five-tryptophan repeat that binds to a specific GAAA genomic
   sequence that is similar to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE). The IRFs become
   activated via phosphorylation at their carboxyl termini, after which they translocate from the
 5 cytoplasm to the nucleus to effect transcription of ISRE-containing genes. The various IRFs
   differ in cellular localisation, structural properties, an activation-induced stimuli, thus
   conferring each IRF with unique functions.
            The loss of IRF7 expression in a primary tumour has now been determined to shift that
   tumour to a metastatic phenotype. This finding in its own right provides a basis on which to
10 routinely screen primary tumours to assess their metastatic status. However, it has been still
   further determined that in these tumours the loss of IRF7 results in downregulation of the
   expression of some or all of the panel of interferon regulated genes listed in Table 1(a). These
   genes have in common the presence of an IRF7 binding site in their promoter region. the
   genes in Table 1(b) are general type I interferon-regulated genes.

 5          Reference to each of the genes detailed above should be understood as a reference to
   all forms of these genes and variants thereof. As would be appreciated by the person of skill in
   the art, some genes are known to exhibit allelic variation between individuals or single
   nucleotide polymorphisms. SNPs encompass insertions and deletions of varying size and
   simple sequence repeats, such as dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats. Variants include
10 nucleic acid sequences from the same region sharing at least 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% sequence
   identity i.e. having one or more deletions, additions, substitutions, inverted sequences etc.
   relative to the genes described herein. Accordingly, the present invention should be
   understood to extend to such variants which, in terms of the present diagnostic applications,
   achieve the same outcome despite the fact that minor genetic variations between the actual
15 nucleic acid sequences may exist between individuals. The present invention should therefore
   be understood to extend to all forms of DNA which arise from any other mutation,

                                                    - 19
   polymorphic or allelic variation.
            In terms of the method of the present invention, screening for the "level of expression"
   of these genes may be achieved in a variety of ways including screening for any of the forms
   of RNA transcribed from these genes or cDNA generated therefrom or the protein expression
 5 product. Reference to "screening for the level of RNA transcripts" should be understood as a
   reference to either screening the RNA directly or screening cDNA transcribed therefrom.
   Changes to the levels of any of these products is indicative of changes to the expression of the
   subject gene. As detailed hereinbefore, the loss of functional IRF7 in tumours which have
   undergone transition to a metastatic phenotype will lead to a reduction or loss in the expression
10 of all or some of the genes of Table 1. Accordingly, in such samples one would expect to
   observe a reduction in transcription and therefore a loss of mRNA transcripts and encoded
   protein expression product. Still further, the nucleic acid molecule or protein which is
   identified and measured may be a whole molecule or a fragment thereof. For example, one
   may identify only fragments of RNA, depending on how the sample has been processed.
15 Provided that said fragment comprises sufficient sequence to indicate its origin with a
   particular gene or protein, fragmented molecules are useful in the context of the method of the
   present invention.
            Reference to "nucleic acid molecule" should be understood as a reference to both
   deoxyribonucleic acid molecules and ribonucleic acid molecules and fragments thereof. The
20 present invention therefore extends to both directly screening for RNA levels in a sample or
   screening for the complementary cDNA which has been reverse-transcribed from an RNA
   population of interest. It is well within the skill of the person of skill in the art to design
   methodology directed to screening for DNA, RNA or protein.
            It is envisioned that any of the genes listed in Table 1 above may be used in the method
25 of the invention either alone or in combination with other genes in Table 1 or other diagnostic
   markers. Although information concerning the expression of as few as one gene is expected to
   provide useful information, confidence in the accuracy of the classification of a tumour as
   metastatic will increase when more markers are included. Tumours may be analysed with
   respect to the expression of groups of these genes, including from 1 to 10 of the of the genes
30 listed in Table 1, in any combination. It is well within the ability of one of skill in the art to
   select groups of genes for analysis from among the genes listed in Table 1.
            In the interest of brevity, applicants are not expressly listing every possible
   combination of genes suitable for use in the invention. Nevertheless, it should be understood

                                                  - 20
  that every such combination is contemplated and is within the scope of the invention.
           In further embodiments, said screening is directed to at least 10 genes, at least 20
  genes, at least 30 genes, at least 40 genes, at least 50 genes, at least 60 genes, at least 70 genes,
  at least 80 genes, at least 90 genes, at least 100 genes, at least 110 genes, at least 120 genes, at
5 least 130 genes, at least 140 genes, at least 150 genes, at least 160 genes, at least 170 genes, at
  least 180 genes, at least 190 genes, at least 200 genes or at least 208 genes.
           In another embodiment, said screening is directed to one or more genes selected from
  Table 2.

           Preferably, said method comprises detecting the expression of IF144, IRF7, CSF2RB,
25 STAT1, TLR3, 1F1202B, IER3, RUNX3, CTSS, IL13RA1, IFITM3 and CD86.
           A further embodiment is directed to a method of assessing the metastatic status of a
   tumour from an individual, said method comprising detecting the expression of RUNX1,
   SQLE, PDXK, YWHAZ, DDX3X, RBBP4, HBEGF, DAB2 and FAM120A by said tumour

                                                   - 22
   wherein a decreased level of expression of said genes relative to the level of expression of said
   genes in a corresponding non-metastatic tumour is indicative of the metastatic phenotype of
   said tumour.
           Preferably, said method comprises detecting the expression of RUNX1, SQLE, PDXK,
 5 HNMT, CALD1, YWHAZ, DDX3X, RBBP4, THBS1, HBEGF, DAB2 and FAM120A.
           Another further embodiment is directed to a method of assessing the metastatic status
   of a tumour from an individual, said method comprising detecting the expression of PTPRK
   and SLC6A6 by said tumour wherein a decreased level of expression of said genes relative to
   the level of expression of said genes in a corresponding non-metastatic tumour is indicative of
10 the metastatic phenotype of said tumour.
           Preferably, said method comprises detecting the expression of CSDE1, ATP6V1B2,
   PTPRK, LGMN, CXCL9, TGIF1, NIPA2, SLC6A6, ARGI, CFP, CTSH and ACSL4.
            Still another further embodiment is directed to a method of assessing the metastatic
   status of a tumour from an individual, said method comprising detecting the expression of
15 DHX58, BST2, IF144, IFIT3, IRF7, STATI, DSP and USP18 by said tumour wherein a
   decreased level of expression of said genes relative to the level of expression of said genes in a
   corresponding non-metastatic tumour is indicative of the metastatic phenotype of said tumour.
           In accordance with the previous aspects, in one embodiment said screening method is
   directed to screening for mRNA or cDNA.
20         In another embodiment, said screening method is directed to screening for the encoded
   protein expression product.
           It would be appreciated by the person of skill in the art that the gene panels detailed
   hereinbefore may be screened for as isolated panels or they may form part of a larger panel.
   That is, one may elect to screen for a given panel together with one or more additional
25 markers.
           In relation to IRF7, IRF9 and STATI, one may screen for localisation of one or more
   of these proteins to the intranuclear region of a tumour cell, since this would indicate the
   successful phosphorylation and thereby signalling of the molecule. Alternatively, one can
   screen for the intracellular presence of the phosphorylated form of the protein. Although one
30 can screen for changes to the absolute levels of these proteins, it should be understood that the
   cellular defect which leads to metastatic transition is not necessarily a loss of IRF7, IRF9 or
   STAT 1 expression per se. The defect may also be a loss of the functional form of these
   proteins. In this case, the protein may still be present, albeit not in a functional form.

                                                   - 23
            Without limiting the present invention to any one theory or mode of action, these
   proteins function by undergoing phosphorylation and thereafter translocation from the
   cytoplasm to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, IRF7 and IRF9 bind to the gene promoter in
   order to induce transcription. Non-functional protein is therefore detectable either by
 5 screening for the localisation of the protein, with cytoplasmic localisation being indicative of
   non-functionality, or phosphorylation, wherein a lack of phosphorylation is indicative of non
   functionality. This form of testing may be done together with testing for the absolute levels of
   protein or for the RNA transcripts of said proteins.
            Reference to "IRF7", "IRF9" and "STAT 1" should be understood as a reference to all
10 forms of these proteins including any isoforms which arise from alternative splicing of the
   subject protein's mRNA or allelic or polymorphic variants.
            The subject gene expression or functional protein levels are measured in the cells of the
   tumour. It would be appreciated by the person of skill in the art that the testing of a tumour to
   determine its metastatic status will often occur after the tumour has been surgically excised.
15 However, to the extent that surgical excision may not be possible or desirable or to the extent
   that an immediate result is sought, a biopsy specimen can be harvested either at or immediately
   after initial diagnosis and the testing can be performed on this specimen.
            The results obtained from the tumour of the individual in issue are assessed relative to
   the level which is present in a corresponding non-metastatic tumour. This is the control level.
20 By "corresponding" is meant a tumour of the same tissue type as the tumour which is the
   subject of testing. For example, if a breast tissue tumour is the subject of analysis in
   accordance with the method of the present invention then the control level of gene or protein
   expression will be that of a non-metastatic breast tissue tumour. The control level may be a
   standard result which reflects individual or collective results obtained from individuals other
25 than the mammal in issue. This form of analysis is in fact a preferred method of analysis since
   it enables the design of kits which require the collection and analysis of a single biological
   sample, being a test sample of interest. The standard results which provide the control level
   may be calculated by any suitable means which would be well known to the person of skill in
   the art. For example, a population of non-metastatic tumour tissues can be assessed in terms of
30 the level of gene or protein expression thereby providing a standard value or range of values
   against which all future test samples are analysed. It should also be understood that this
   control level may be determined from the subjects of a specific cohort and for use with respect
   to test samples derived from that cohort. Accordingly, there may be determined a number of

                                                    - 24
   standard values or ranges which correspond to cohorts which differ in respect of characteristics
   such as age, gender, ethnicity or health status. It is to be expected that standards would be
   developed for each tissue type in which a tumour can arise. Said "control level" may be a
   discrete level or a range of levels.
 5           The biological sample which is tested according to the method of the present invention
   may be tested directly or may require some form of treatment prior to testing. For example, a
   tissue sample may require homogenisation prior to testing or it may require sectioning for in
   situ testing of the intracellular localisation of proteins. Alternatively, a cell sample may
   require permeabilisation prior to testing. Further, to the extent that the biological sample is not
10 in liquid form, (if such form is required for testing) it may require the addition of a reagent,
   such as a buffer, to mobilise the sample.
             The biological sample may be directly tested or else all or some of the nucleic acid or
   protein material present in the biological sample may be isolated prior to testing. To this end,
   it would be appreciated that when screening for changes to the level of expression of the genes
15 in Table 1, one may screen for the RNA transcripts themselves or cDNA which has been
   transcribed therefrom. In yet another example, the sample may be partially purified or
   otherwise enriched prior to analysis. It is within the scope of the present invention for the
   target cell population or molecules derived therefrom to be pretreated prior to testing, for
   example, inactivation of live virus or being run on a gel. It should also be understood that the
20 biological sample may be freshly harvested or it may have been stored (for example by
   freezing) prior to testing or otherwise treated prior to testing (such as by undergoing culturing).
             The term "individual" or "patient" as used herein includes humans, primates, livestock
   animals (e.g. horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, donkeys), laboratory test animals (e.g. mice, rats,
   guinea pigs), companion animals (e.g. dogs, cats) and captive wild animals (e.g. kangaroos,
25 deer, foxes). Preferably the mammal is a human or a laboratory test animal. Even more
   preferably, the mammal is a human.
            It should be understood that the decrease in the level of expression of the subject
   molecules, in a tumour which has transitioned to a metastatic phenotype, may be either a
   partial reduction in the level of expression relative to control levels or it may be a complete
30 absence of expression. It should also be understood that the degree of reduction in expression
   may vary between genes. Accordingly to the extent that six or more of the genes of Table 1
   are tested, the degree to which expression levels are reduced as between the genes may differ.
   However, the critical issue is that the levels of each gene will be reduced relative to its

                                                     - 25
   corresponding control. It should also be expected that as between different patients with the
   same type of primary tumour being tested, there may be observed variation in the degree of
   reduction of expression of the genes which are tested. However, provided that the observed
   level is below the non-metastatic tumour control level, this is indicative of the shift to a
 5 metastatic phenotype.
           Means for testing for changes to the expression levels of one or more of the genes listed
   in Table 1 in a tumour sample can be achieved by any suitable method, which would be well
   known to the person of skill in the art, such as but not limited to assessment of expression
   profiles of RNA by array technologies (Alon et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA: 96, 6745-6750,
10 June 1999).
          A "microarray" is a linear or multi-dimensional array of preferably discrete regions, each
   having a defined area, formed on the surface of a solid support. The density of the discrete
   regions on a microarray is determined by the total numbers of target polynucleotides to be
   detected on the surface of a single solid phase support. As used herein, a DNA microarray is
15 an array of oligonucleotide probes placed onto a chip or other surfaces used to detect
   complementary oligonucleotides from a complex nucleic acid mixture. Since the position of
   each particular group of probes in the array is known, the identities of the target
   polynucleotides can be determined based on their binding to a particular position in the
   microarray.
20         DNA microarray technology makes it possible to conduct a large scale assay of a
   plurality of target nucleic acid molecules on a single solid phase support. U.S. Pat. No.
   5,837,832 (Chee et al.) and related patent applications describe immobilizing an array of
   oligonucleotide probes for hybridization and detection of specific nucleic acid sequences in a
   sample. Target polynucleotides of interest isolated from a tissue of interest are hybridized to
25 the DNA chip and the specific sequences detected based on the target polynucleotides'
   preference and degree of hybridization at discrete probe locations. One important use of arrays
   is in the analysis of differential gene expression, where the profile of expression of genes in
   different cells or tissues, often a tissue of interest and a control tissue, is compared and any
   differences in gene expression among the respective tissues are identified. Such information is
30 useful for the identification of the types of genes expressed in a particular tissue type and
   diagnosis of conditions based on the expression profile.
           In one example, RNA from the sample of interest is subjected to reverse transcription to
   obtain labelled cDNA. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,410,229 (Lockhart et al.) The cDNA is then

                                                  - 26
   hybridized to oligonucleotides or cDNAs of known sequence arrayed on a chip or other surface
   in a known order. In another example, the RNA is isolated from a biological sample and
   hybridised to a chip on which are anchored cDNA probes. The location of the oligonucleotide
   to which the labelled cDNA hybridizes provides sequence information on the cDNA, while the
 5 amount of labelled hybridized RNA or cDNA provides an estimate of the relative
   representation of the RNA or cDNA of interest. See Schena et al. Science 270:467-470 (1995).
   For example, use of a cDNA microarray to analyze gene expression patterns in human cancer
   is described by DeRisi, et al. (Nature Genetics 14:457-460 (1996)).
          In one embodiment, nucleic acid probes corresponding to the subject nucleic acids are
10 made. The nucleic acid probes attached to the microarray are designed to be substantially
   complementary to the nucleic acids of the biological sample such that specific hybridization of
   the target sequence and the probes of the present invention occurs. This complementarity need
   not be perfect, in that there may be any number of base pair mismatches that will interfere with
   hybridization between the target sequence and the single stranded nucleic acids of the present
15 invention. It is expected that the overall homology of the genes at the nucleotide level
   probably will be about 40% or greater, probably about 60% or greater, and even more probably
   about 80% or greater; and in addition that there will be corresponding contiguous sequences of
   about 8-12 nucleotides or longer. However, if the number of mutations is so great that no
   hybridization can occur under even the least stringent of hybridization conditions, the sequence
20 is not a complementary target sequence. Thus, by "substantially complementary" herein is
   meant that the probes are sufficiently complementary to the target sequences to hybridize
   under normal reaction conditions, particularly high stringency conditions.
          A nucleic acid probe is generally single stranded but can be partly single and partly
   double stranded. The strandedness of the probe is dictated by the structure, composition, and
25 properties of the target sequence. In general, the oligonucleotide probes range from about 6, 8,
    10, 12, 15, 20, 30 to about 100 bases long, with from about 10 to about 80 bases being
   preferred, and from about 15 to about 40 bases being particularly preferred. That is, generally
   entire genes are rarely used as probes. In some embodiments, much longer nucleic acids can be
   used, up to hundreds of bases. The probes are sufficiently specific to hybridize to a
30 complementary template sequence under conditions known by those of skill in the art. The
   number of mismatches between the probe's sequences and their complementary template
   (target) sequences to which they hybridize during hybridization generally do not exceed 15%,
   usually do not exceed 10% and preferably do not exceed 5%, as-determined by BLAST

                                                  - 27
   (default settings).
          Oligonucleotide probes can include the naturally-occurring heterocyclic bases normally
   found in nucleic acids (uracil, cytosine, thymine, adenine and guanine), as well as modified
   bases and base analogues. Any modified base or base analogue compatible with hybridization
 5 of the probe to a target sequence is useful in the practice of the invention. The sugar or
   glycoside portion of the probe can comprise deoxyribose, ribose, and/or modified forms of
   these sugars, such as, for example, 2'-O-alkyl ribose. In a preferred embodiment, the sugar
   moiety is 2'-deoxyribose; however, any sugar moiety that is compatible with the ability of the
   probe to hybridize to a target sequence can be used.
10        In one embodiment, the nucleoside units of the probe are linked by a phosphodiester
   backbone, as is well known in the art. In additional embodiments, intemucleotide linkages can
   include any linkage known to one of skill in the art that is compatible with specific
   hybridization of the probe including, but not limited to phosphorothioate, methylphosphonate,
   sulfamate (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,967) and polyamide (i.e., peptide nucleic acids). Peptide
15 nucleic acids are described in Nielsen et al. (1991) Science 254: 1497-1500, U.S. Pat. No.
   5,714,331, and Nielsen (1999) Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 10:71-75.
          In certain embodiments, the probe can be a chimeric molecule; i.e., can comprise more
   than one type of base or sugar subunit, and/or the linkages can be of more than one type within
   the same primer. The probe can comprise a moiety to facilitate hybridization to its target
20 sequence, as are known in the art, for example, intercalators and/or minor groove binders.
   Variations of the bases, sugars, and intemucleoside backbone, as well as the presence of any
   pendant group on the probe, will be compatible with the ability of the probe to bind, in a
   sequence-specific fashion, with its target sequence. A large number of structural modifications,
   are possible within these bounds. Advantageously, the probes according to the present
25 invention may have structural characteristics such that they allow the signal amplification,
   such structural characteristics being, for example, branched DNA probes as those described by
   Urdea et al. (Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser., 24:197-200 (1991)) or in the European Patent No. EP
   0225,807. Moreover, synthetic methods for preparing the various heterocyclic bases, sugars,
   nucleosides and nucleotides that form the probe, and preparation of oligonucleotides of
30 specific predetermined sequence, are well-developed and known in the art. A preferred
   method for oligonucleotide synthesis incorporates the teaching of U.S. Pat. No. 5,419,966.
          Multiple probes may be designed for a particular target nucleic acid to account for
   polymorphism and/or secondary structure in the target nucleic acid, redundancy of data and the

                                                   -28
   like. In some embodiments, where more than one probe per sequence is used, either
   overlapping probes or probes to different sections of a single target gene are used. That is,
   two, three, four or more probes, are used to build in a redundancy for a particular target. The
   probes can be overlapping (i.e. have some sequence in common), or are specific for distinct
 5 sequences of a gene. When multiple target polynucleotides are to be detected according to the
   present invention, each probe or probe group corresponding to a particular target
   polynucleotide is situated in a discrete area of the microarray.
          Probes may be in solution, such as in wells or on the surface of a micro-array, or
   attached to a solid support. Examples of solid support materials that can be used include a
10 plastic, a ceramic, a metal, a resin, a gel and a membrane. Useful types of solid supports
   include plates, beads, magnetic material, microbeads, hybridization chips, membranes,
   crystals, ceramics and self-assembling monolayers. One example comprises a two
   dimensional or three-dimensional matrix, such as a gel or hybridization chip with multiple
   probe binding sites (Pevzner et al., J. Biomol. Struc. & Dyn. 9:399-410, 1991; Maskos and
15 Southern, Nuc. Acids Res. 20:1679-84, 1992). Hybridization chips can be used to construct
   very large probe arrays that are subsequently hybridized with a target nucleic acid. Analysis of
   the hybridization pattern of the chip can assist in the identification of the target nucleotide
   sequence. Patterns can be manually or computer analyzed, but it is clear that positional
   sequencing by hybridization lends itself to computer analysis and automation. In another
20 example, one may use an Affymetrix chip on a solid phase structural support in combination
   with a fluorescent bead based approach. In yet another example, one may utilise a cDNA
   microarray. In this regard, the oligonucleotides described by Lockkart et al. (i.e. Affymetrix
   synthesis probes in situ on the solid phase) are particularly preferred, that is, photolithography.
          As will be appreciated by those in the art, nucleic acids can be attached or immobilized
25 to a solid support in a wide variety of ways. By "immobilized" herein is meant the association
   or binding between the nucleic acid probe and the solid support is sufficient to be stable under
   the conditions of binding, washing, analysis, and removal. The binding can be covalent or
   non-covalent. By "non-covalent binding" and grammatical equivalents herein is meant one or
   more of either electrostatic, hydrophilic, and hydrophobic interactions. Included in non
30 covalent binding is the covalent attachment of a molecule, such as streptavidin, to the support
   and the non-covalent binding of the biotinylated probe to the streptavidin. By "covalent
   binding" and grammatical equivalents herein is meant that the two moieties, the solid support
   and the probe, are attached by at least one bond, including sigma bonds, pi bonds and

                                                   - 29
   coordination bonds. Covalent bonds can be formed directly between the probe and the solid
   support or can be formed by a cross linker or by inclusion of a specific reactive group on either
   the solid support or the probe or both molecules. Immobilization may also involve a
   combination of covalent and non-covalent interactions.
 5        Nucleic acid probes may be attached to the solid support by covalent binding such as by
   conjugation with a coupling agent or by covalent or non-covalent binding such as electrostatic
   interactions, hydrogen bonds or antibody-antigen coupling, or by combinations thereof.
   Typical coupling agents include biotin/avidin, biotin/streptavidin, Staphylococcus aureus
   protein A/IgG antibody Fc fragment, and streptavidin/protein A chimeras (T. Sano and C. R.
10 Cantor,Bio/Technology 9:1378-81 (1991)), or derivatives or combinations of these agents.
   Nucleic acids may be attached to the solid support by a photocleavable bond, an electrostatic
   bond, a disulfide bond, a peptide bond, a diester bond or a combination of these sorts of bonds.
   The array may also be attached to the solid support by a selectively releasable bond such as
   4,4'-dimethoxytrityl or its derivative. Derivatives which have been found to be useful include
15 3 or 4 [bis-(4-methoxyphenyl)]-methyl-benzoic acid, N-succinimidyl-3 or 4 [bis-(4
   methoxyphenyl)]-methyl-benzoic acid, N-succinimidyl-3 or 4 [bis-(4-methoxyphenyl)]
   hydroxymethyl-benzoic acid, N-succinimidyl-3 or 4 [bis-(4-methoxyphenyl)]-chloromethyl
   benzoic acid, and salts of these acids.
          In general, the probes are attached to the microarray in a wide variety of ways, as will be
20 appreciated by those in the art. As described herein, the nucleic acids can either be synthesized
   first, with subsequent attachment to the microarray, or can be directly synthesized on the
   microarray.
          The microarray comprises a suitable solid substrate. By "substrate" or "solid support" or
   other grammatical equivalents herein is meant any material that can be modified to contain
25 discrete individual sites appropriate for the attachment or association of the nucleic acid probes
   and is amenable to at least one detection method. The solid phase support of the present
   invention can be of any solid materials and structures suitable for supporting nucleotide
   hybridization and synthesis. Preferably, the solid phase support comprises at least one
   substantially rigid surface on which the primers can be immobilized and the reverse
30 transcriptase reaction performed. The substrates with which the polynucleotide microarray
   elements are stably associated and may be fabricated from a variety of materials, including
   plastics, ceramics, metals, acrylamide, cellulose, nitrocellulose, glass, polystyrene,
   polyethylene vinyl acetate, polypropylene, polymethacrylate, polyethylene, polyethylene

                                                  - 30
   oxide, polysilicates, polycarbonates, Teflon, fluorocarbons, nylon, silicon rubber,
   polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polyorthoesters, polypropylfumerate,
   collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and polyamino acids. Substrates may be two-dimensional or
   three-dimensional in form, such as gels, membranes, thin films, glasses, plates, cylinders,
 5 beads, magnetic beads, optical fibers, woven fibers, etc. A preferred form of array is a three
   dimensional array. A preferred three-dimensional array is a collection of tagged beads. Each
   tagged bead has different primers attached to it. Tags are detectable by signalling means such
   as color (Luminex, Illumina) and electromagnetic field (Pharmaseq) and signals on tagged
   beads can even be remotely detected (e.g., using optical fibers). The size of the solid support
10 can be any of the standard microarray sizes, useful for DNA microarray technology, and the
   size may be tailored to fit the particular machine being used to conduct a reaction of the
   invention. In general, the substrates allow optical detection and do not appreciably fluoresce.
          In one embodiment, the surface of the microarray and the probe may be derivatized with
   chemical functional groups for subsequent attachment of the two. Thus, for example, the
15 microarray is derivatized with a chemical functional group including, but not limited to, amino
   groups, carboxy groups, oxo groups and thiol groups, with amino groups being particularly
   preferred. Using these functional groups, the probes can be attached using functional groups on
   the probes. For example, nucleic acids containing amino groups can be attached to surfaces
   comprising amino groups, for example using linkers as are known in the art; for example,
20 homo-or hetero-bifunctional linkers as are well known. In addition, in some cases, additional
   linkers, such as alkyl groups (including substituted and heteroalkyl groups) may be used.
          In this embodiment, the oligonucleotides are synthesized as is known in the art, and then
   attached to the surface of the solid support. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art,
   either the 5' or 3' terminus may be attached to the solid support, or attachment may be via an
25 internal nucleoside. In an additional embodiment, the immobilization to the solid support may
   be very strong, yet non-covalent. For example, biotinylated oligonucleotides can be made,
   which bind to surfaces covalently coated with streptavidin, resulting in attachment.
          The arrays may be produced according to any convenient methodology, such as
   preforming the polynucleotide microarray elements and then stably associating them with the
30 surface. Alternatively, the oligonucleotides may be synthesized on the surface, as is known in
   the art. A number of different array configurations and methods for their production are
   known to those of skill in the art and disclosed in WO 95/25116 and WO 95/35505
   (photolithographic techniques), U.S. Pat. No. 5,445,934 (in situ synthesis by

                                                   -31
   photolithography), U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,261 (in situ synthesis by mechanically directed flow
   paths); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,637 (synthesis by spotting, printing or coupling); the disclosure
   of which are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference. Another method for coupling
   DNA to beads uses specific ligands attached to the end of the DNA to link to ligand-binding
 5 molecules attached to a bead. Possible ligand-binding partner pairs include biotin
   avidin/streptavidin, or various antibody/antigen pairs such as digoxygenin-antidigoxygenin
   antibody (Smith et al., Science 258:1122-1126 (1992)). Covalent chemical attachment of
   DNA to the support can be accomplished by using standard coupling agents to link the 5'
   phosphate on the DNA to coated microspheres through a phosphoamidate bond. Methods for
10 immobilization of oligonucleotides to solid-state substrates are well established. See Pease et
   al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91(11):5022-5026 (1994). A preferred method of attaching
   oligonucleotides to solid-state substrates is described by Guo et al., Nucleic Acids Res.
   22:5456-5465 (1994). Immobilization can be accomplished either by in situ DNA synthesis
   (Maskos and Southern, supra) or by covalent attachment of chemically synthesized
15 oligonucleotides (Guo et al., supra) in combination with robotic arraying technologies.
          In addition to the solid-phase technology represented by microarray arrays, gene
   expression can also be quantified using liquid-phase assays. One such system is kinetic
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Kinetic PCR allows for the simultaneous amplification and
   quantification of specific nucleic acid sequences. The specificity is derived from synthetic
20 oligonucleotide primers designed to preferentially adhere to single-stranded nucleic acid
   sequences bracketing the target site. This pair of oligonucleotide primers form specific, non
   covalently bound complexes on each strand of the target sequence. These complexes facilitate
   in vitro transcription of double-stranded DNA in opposite orientations. Temperature cycling
   of the reaction mixture creates a continuous cycle of primer binding, transcription, and re
25 melting of the nucleic acid to individual strands. The result is an exponential increase of the
   target dsDNA product. This product can be quantified in real time either through the use of an
   intercalating dye or a sequence specific probe. SYBR(r) Green 1, is an example of an
   intercalating dye, that preferentially binds to dsDNA resulting in a concomitant increase in the
   fluorescent signal. Sequence specific probes, such as used with TaqMan technology, consist of
30 a fluorochrome and a quenching molecule covalently bound to opposite ends of an
   oligonucleotide. The probe is designed to selectively bind the target DNA sequence between
   the two primers. When the DNA strands are synthesized during the PCR reaction, the
   fluorochrome is cleaved from the probe by the exonuclease activity of the polymerase resulting

                                                  - 32
   in signal dequenching. The probe signalling method can be more specific than the
   intercalating dye method, but in each case, signal strength is proportional to the dsDNA
   product produced. Each type of quantification method can be used in multi-well liquid phase
   arrays with each well representing primers and/or probes specific to nucleic acid sequences of
 5 interest. When used with messenger RNA preparations of tissues or cell lines, an array of
   probe/primer reactions can simultaneously quantify the expression of multiple gene products
   of interest. See Germer et al., Genome Res. 10:258-266 (2000); Heid et al., Genome Res.
   6:986-994 (1996).
            Means for testing for changes to the functional levels of the IRF7, IRF9 and STAT 1
10 proteins can also be achieved by any suitable method which would be well known to the
   person of skill in the art. For example, screening for the intracellular localisation of a protein
   can be achieved by simple immunohistochemistry.
            Examples of suitable methods include, but are not limited to, antibody screening of
   tissue sections or biopsy specimens.
15          To the extent that antibody based methods of diagnosis are used, the presence of the
   marker protein may be determined in a number of ways such as by Western blotting, ELISA or
   flow cytometry procedures. These, of course, include both single-site and two-site or
   "sandwich" assays of the non-competitive types, as well as in the traditional competitive
   binding assays. These assays also include direct binding of a labelled antibody to a target.
20          Sandwich assays are among the most useful and commonly used assays. A number of
   variations of the sandwich assay technique exist, and all are intended to be encompassed by the
   present invention. Briefly, in a typical forward assay, an unlabelled antibody is immobilized
   on a solid substrate and the sample to be tested brought into contact with the bound molecule.
   After a suitable period of incubation, for a period of time sufficient to allow formation of an
25 antibody-antigen complex, a second antibody specific to the antigen, labelled with a reporter
   molecule capable of producing a detectable signal is then added and incubated, allowing time
   sufficient for the formation of another complex of antibody-antigen-labelled antibody. Any
   unreacted material is washed away, and the presence of the antigen is determined by
   observation of a signal produced by the reporter molecule. The results may either be
30 qualitative, by simple observation of the visible signal, or may be quantitated by comparing
   with a control sample. Variations on the forward assay include a simultaneous assay, in which
   both sample and labelled antibody are added simultaneously to the bound antibody. These
   techniques are well known to those skilled in the art, including any minor variations as will be

                                                   - 33
   readily apparent.
            In the typical forward sandwich assay, a first antibody having specificity for the marker
   or antigenic parts thereof, is either covalently or passively bound to a solid surface. The solid
   surface is typically glass or a polymer, the most commonly used polymers being cellulose,
 5 polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene. The solid supports
   may be in the form of tubes, beads, discs of microplates, or any other surface suitable for
   conducting an immunoassay. The binding processes are well-known in the art and generally
   consist of cross-linking, covalently binding or physically adsorbing, the polymer-antibody
   complex is washed in preparation for the test sample. An aliquot of the sample to be tested is
10 then added to the solid phase complex and incubated for a period of time sufficient (e.g. 2-40
   minutes) and under suitable conditions (e.g. 250 C) to allow binding of any subunit present in
   the antibody. Following the incubation period, the antibody subunit solid phase is washed and
   dried and incubated with a second antibody specific for a portion of the antigen. The second
   antibody is linked to a reporter molecule which is used to indicate the binding of the second
15 antibody to the antigen.
            By "reporter molecule" as used in the present specification, is meant a molecule which,
   by its chemical nature, provides an analytically identifiable signal which allows the detection
   of antigen-bound antibody. Detection may be either qualitative or quantitative. The most
   commonly used reporter molecules in this type of assay are either enzymes, fluorophores or
20 radionuclide containing molecules (i.e. radioisotopes) and chemiluminescent molecules.
            In the case of an enzyme immunoassay, an enzyme is conjugated to the second
   antibody, generally by means of glutaraldehyde or periodate. As will be readily recognized,
   however, a wide variety of different conjugation techniques exist, which are readily available
   to the skilled artisan. Commonly used enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, glucose
25 oxidase, beta-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase, amongst others. The substrates to be
   used with the specific enzymes are generally chosen for the production, upon hydrolysis by the
   corresponding enzyme, of a detectable color change. Examples of suitable enzymes include
   alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase. It is also possible to employ fluorogenic substrates,
   which yield a fluorescent product rather than the chromogenic substrates noted above. In all
30 cases, the enzyme-labelled antibody is added to the first antibody hapten complex, allowed to
   bind, and then the excess reagent is washed away. A solution containing the appropriate
   substrate is then added to the complex of antibody-antigen-antibody. The substrate will react
   with the enzyme linked to the second antibody, giving a qualitative visual signal, which may

                                                   - 34
   be further quantitated, usually spectrophotometrically, to give an indication of the amount of
   antigen which was present in the sample. "Reporter molecule" also extends to use of cell
   agglutination or inhibition of agglutination such as red blood cells on latex beads, and the like.
            Alternately, fluorescent compounds, such as fluorecein and rhodamine, may be
 5 chemically coupled to antibodies without altering their binding capacity. When activated by
   illumination with light of a particular wavelength, the fluorochrome-labelled antibody adsorbs
   the light energy, inducing a state to excitability in the molecule, followed by emission of the
   light at a characteristic color visually detectable with a light microscope. As in the EIA, the
   fluorescent labelled antibody is allowed to bind to the first antibody-hapten complex. After
10 washing off the unbound reagent, the remaining tertiary complex is then exposed to the light of
   the appropriate wavelength the fluorescence observed indicates the presence of the hapten of
   interest. Immunofluorescence and EIA techniques are both very well established in the art and
   are particularly preferred for the present method. However, other reporter molecules, such as
   radioisotope, chemiluminescent or bioluminescent molecules, may also be employed.
15          To the extent that one elects to screen for the phosphorylation status of these proteins,
   this can be achieved either qualitatively or quantitatively. At its simplest, assessment by eye of
   the intensity of a band which has developed, such as on an autoradiograph following
   incorporation of a radioactive phosphate (e.g. [3 2 P] - yATP) or immunoblotting using an
   antibody that specifically recognises the phosphorylated residue, in isolation (i.e. the
20 presence/absence of any phosphorylation) or relative to a control test may be performed,
   wherein a darker and/or thicker band is indicative of a higher level of phosphorylation than a
   fainter and/or thinner band. A corresponding type of analysis can be qualitatively or
   quantitatively performed with reporter readouts. More sophisticated analysis can be performed
   utilising equipment such as a densitometer based on visible light or fluorescence, which can
25 empirically calculate the concentration of a phosphorylated protein in a given band relative to a
   standard.
            In a related aspect, the present findings have enabled the development of means for
   treating metastatic cancer. It should be understood that the method of this aspect of the present
   invention is best used as an adjunct therapy to whatever treatment regime has been selected to
30 target the primary tumour. For example, it may be that the primary tumour is surgically
   removed and the subject treatment method is subsequently applied in order to therapeutically
   treat metastatic disease. In another example, the primary tumour may not be surgically
   removable and is being treated by radiation therapy while nevertheless simultaneously treating

                                                   - 35
   the patient for metastatic tumours using the present method. It would be appreciated by the
   skilled person that the application of the method of the present invention is generally going to
   be indicated after analysis of the primary tumour has revealed a shift to a metastatic phenotype.
            Without limiting the present invention in any way, it would be appreciated that the
 5 diagnostic method herein disclosed identifies the shift to a metastatic phenotype, in some cases
   metastatic spread may already have commenced while in other clinical situations, although the
   shift to a metastatic phenotype may have occurred, the actual spread of primary tumour cells to
   other organs may not yet have occurred. It is to be expected that other than in the more
   advanced stages of metastatic cancer, where the metastatic tumours become more highly
10 visible, one may not be able to confirm whether or not metastatic spread of the primary tumour
   has occurred. Accordingly, the method of the present invention may be functioning
   prophylactically, such as where a primary tumour exhibiting a metastatic phenotype cannot be
   surgically removed but has not yet actually spread, or it may be functioning therapeutically,
   such as where metastatic spread has commenced, even if these metastases are not yet
15 detectable by conventional diagnostic techniques.
            Although the treatment method of this aspect of the present invention has utility in the
   treatment of either advanced stage or early stage metastatic disease, its application in
   preventing or treating early stage metastases is particularly significant since this provides a
   means of potentially preventing a patient from reaching the point of advanced disease, which
20 can be both debilitating and lead to poorer prognostic outcomes due to the range of other
   clinical problems which are associated with advanced stage disease and which can render late
   stage treatments less effective. To date there has not been an effective means of treating
   metastatic disease. Chemotherapy is the primary treatment used to date, this being very non
   specific and of only moderate effectiveness. Clinicians have also been reluctant to subject
25 patients to this treatment regime, due to its side effects, where there has been no clinical
   indication of metastatic disease. Often it is the case that by the time metastases are
   diagnosable, though, they are relatively advanced and the prognosis is poor. The fact that the
   method of the present invention has now, for the first time, provided both a means to
   accurately and simply determine, even at the very early stages, whether a primary tumour has
30 become metastatic and a means to treat the metastatic tumours based on a treatment regime
   which targets the specific defect in these cells, being non-functional IRF7, is a significant step
   forward in the field of oncology.
            As detailed hereinbefore, the present invention is predicated on the determination that

                                                  - 36
   the loss of functional IRF7 in a primary tumour induces a shift to a metastatic phenotype.
   Accordingly, in addition to the fact that a diagnostic method has been developed based on
   screening for the status of the IRF7 related gene signature in primary tumours, it has also been
   determined that restoration of the IRF7 pathway provides an effective treatment regime.
 5          Accordingly, this aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of treating
   metastatic cancer in an individual, which cancer is characterised by aberrant IRF7
   functionality, said method comprising administering an effective amount of a composition,
   wherein said composition comprises an agent which upregulates the level of Type I IFN in said
   individual.
10          Reference to "aberrant IRF7 functionality" should be understood as a reference to a
   metastatic cancer which derives from a primary tumour of the type diagnosable by the method
   of the first aspect of the present invention. That is, briefly, IRF7 has become non-functional or
   less functional within the primary tumour and has therefore resulted in the shift of the tumour
   to a metastatic phenotype. This is diagnostically characterised by a loss of expression of 6 or
15 more genes of Table 1 by the tumour cells or a reduction in the functional levels of IRF7, IRF9
   and STAT 1. Without limiting the present invention to any one theory or mode of action,
   patients exhibiting this defect in a primary tumour have been determined to respond favourably
   to Type I IFN therapy which acts to restore IRF7 pathway functionality, thereby effectively
   treating metastatic disease.
20          Reference to "metastatic" and "individual" should be understood to have the same
   meaning as hereinbefore defined.
            In one embodiment said metastatic cancer is a cancer of the breast, colon, kidney,
   lungs, skin, ovary, pancreas, prostate, rectum, stomach, thyroid or uterus.
            In another embodiment the present invention is more particularly directed to a method
25 of treating a breast, kidney or prostate metastatic cancer in an individual, which cancer is
   characterised by aberrant IRF7 functionality, said method comprising administering an
   effective amount of a composition, wherein said composition comprises an agent which
   upregulates the level of Type I IFN in said individual.
            Reference to a "breast, kidney, prostate" or other metastatic cancer should be
30 understood as a reference to a metastatic cancer which has arisen from a primary tumour
   present in one of these organs. The present invention is not limited to these organs, however,
   can extend to metastatic cancers arising from any organ, such as those mentioned hereinbefore,
   which are characterised by a loss of IRF7 functionality, this now being routinely diagnosable.

                                                   - 37
            In another embodiment there is provided a method of treating metastatic cancer, which
   metastases are present in the bone and which cancer is characterised by aberrant IRF7
   functionality, in an individual, said method comprising administering an effective amount of a
   composition, wherein said composition comprises an agent which upregulates the level if Type
 5 I IFN in said individual.
            Without limiting the present invention to any one theory or mode of action, human
   Type I IFNs bind to a specific cell surface receptor complex known as the IFN-C receptor
   (IFNAR) that consists of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains. The mammalian Type I IFNs are
   designated IFN-c (alpha), IFN-$ (beta), IFN-K (kappa), IFN-6 (delta), IFN-E (epsilon), IFN-T
10 (tau), IFN-o (omega), and IFN-( (zeta, also known as limitin). Reference to "Type I IFN"
   should therefore be understood as a reference to any interferon type which falls within this
   class including all precursor, proprotein, or intermediate forms. it also includes reference to
   any isoforms which may arise from alternative splicing of Type I IFN mRNA or polymorphic
   forms of a Type I IFN. Reference to Type I IFN extends to any Type I IFN protein, whether
15 existing as a dimer, multimer or fusion protein. In one embodiment, said Type I IFN is IFN-C
   or IFN-$.
            Accordingly, in one embodiment there is provided a method of treating metastatic
   cancer in a patient which cancer is characterised by aberrant IRF7 functionality, said method
   comprising administering an effective amount of a composition, wherein said composition
20 comprises an agent which upregulates the level of IFN-c in said patient.
            In another embodiment there is provided a method of treating metastatic cancer in an
   individual which cancer is characterised by aberrant IRF7 functionality, said method
   comprising administering an effective amount of a composition wherein said composition
   comprises an agent which upregulates the level of IFN-$ in said individual.
25          An "effective amount" means an amount necessary at least partly to attain the desired
   immune response, or to prevent or to delay the onset or inhibit progression or halt altogether,
   the onset or progression of a particular condition being treated. This amount varies depending
   upon the health and physical condition of the individual to be treated, the taxonomic group of
   the individual to be treated, the capacity of the individual's immune system to stimulate a
30 specific immune response, the degree of protection desired, the formulation of the vaccine, the
   assessment of the medical situation, and other relevant factors. It is expected that the amount
   will fall in a relatively broad range that can be determined through routine trials.

                                                  - 38
           In a related aspect there is provided the use of an agent which upregulates the level of
   Type I IFN in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a metastatic cancer in an
   individual, which cancer is characterised by aberrant IRF7 functionality.
           In one embodiment said metastatic cancer is a cancer of the breast, colon, kidney,
 5 lungs, skin, ovary, pancreas, prostate, rectum, stomach, thyroid or uterus.
           In another embodiment, said cancer is characterised by the onset of bone metastases.
           In still another embodiment, said Type I IFN is IFN-c or IFN-$.
           In terms of the agent which upregulates the level of Type I IFN, this can be any
   suitable molecule including, but not limited to:
10         (i)       the Type I IFN protein or functional fragment thereof;
           (ii)      a nucleic acid molecule encoding Type I IFN or functional fragment thereof;
           (iii)     a proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous molecule which upregulates the
   expression of Type I IFN such as by modulating the transcriptional or translational regulation
   of the Type I IFN gene;
15         (iv)      a proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous molecule which interacts with a Pattern
   Recognition receptor such as the Toll-like receptor including, for example, the TLR7/8 agonist
   imiquimod.
           The proteinaceous molecules described above may be derived from any suitable source
   such as natural, recombinant or synthetic sources and includes fusion proteins or molecules
20 which have been identified following, for example, natural product screening. The reference
   to non-proteinaceous molecules may be, for example, a reference to a nucleic acid molecule or
   it may be a molecule derived from natural sources, such as for example natural product
   screening, or may be a chemically synthesised molecule. The present invention contemplates
   analogues of Type I IFN expression product or small molecules capable of acting as agonists.
25 Chemical agonists may not necessarily be derived from the Type I IFN expression product but
   may share certain conformational similarities. Alternatively, chemical agonists may be
   specifically designed to meet certain physiochemical properties.
           The proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous molecules referred to in points (i)-(iv),
   above, are herein collectively referred to as "modulatory agents".
30         Screening for the modulatory agents hereinbefore defined can be achieved by any one
   of several suitable methods including, but in no way limited to, contacting a cell comprising
   the Type I IFN gene or functional equivalent or derivative thereof with an agent and screening
   for the modulation of Type I IFN protein production or functional activity, modulation of the

                                                  - 39
   expression of a nucleic acid molecule encoding Type I IFN or modulation of the activity or
   expression of a downstream Type I IFN cellular target. Detecting such modulation can be
   achieved utilising techniques such as Western blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assays
   and/or the readout of reporters of Type I IFN activity such as luciferases, CAT and the like.
 5          It should be understood that the Type I IFN gene or functional equivalent or derivative
   thereof may be naturally occurring in the cell which is the subject of testing or it may have
   been transfected into a host cell for the purpose of testing. Further, to the extent that a Type I
   IFN nucleic acid molecule is transfected into a cell, that molecule may comprise the entire
   Type I IFN gene or it may merely comprise a portion of the gene such as the portion which
10 regulates expression of the Type I IFN product. For example, the Type I IFN promoter region
   may be transfected into the cell which is the subject of testing. In this regard, where only the
   promoter is utilised, detecting modulation of the activity of the promoter can be achieved, for
   example, by ligating the promoter to a reporter gene. For example, the promoter may be
   ligated to luciferase or a CAT reporter, the modulation of expression of which gene can be
15 detected via modulation of fluorescence intensity or CAT reporter activity, respectively. Yet
   another example includes Type I IFN binding sites ligated to a minimal reporter.
            These methods provide a mechanism for performing high throughput screening of
   putative modulatory agents such as the proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous agents comprising
   synthetic, combinatorial, chemical and natural libraries. These methods will also facilitate the
20 detection of agents which bind either the Type I IFN nucleic acid molecule or expression
   product itself or which modulate the expression of an upstream molecule, which upstream
   molecule subsequently modulates Type I IFN expression or expression product activity.
   Accordingly, these methods provide a mechanism of detecting agents which either directly or
   indirectly modulate Type I IFN expression and/or activity.
25          The agents which are utilised in accordance with the method of the present invention
   may take any suitable form. For example, proteinaceous agents may be glycosylated or
   unglycosylated, phosphorylated or dephosphorylated to various degrees and/or may contain a
   range of other molecules used, linked, bound or otherwise associated with the proteins such as
   amino acids, lipid, carbohydrates or other peptides, polypeptides or proteins. Similarly, the
30 subject non-proteinaceous molecules may also take any suitable form. Both the proteinaceous
   and non-proteinaceous agents herein described may be linked, bound otherwise associated with
   any other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous molecules. For example, in one embodiment of
   the present invention said agent is associated with a molecule which permits its targeting to a

                                                  - 40
   localised region.
            The subject proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous molecule may act either directly or
   indirectly to modulate the expression of Type I IFN or the activity of the Type I IFN
   expression product. Said molecule acts directly if it associates with the Type I IFN nucleic
 5 acid molecule or expression product to modulate expression or activity, respectively. Said
   molecule acts indirectly if it associates with a molecule other than the Type I IFN nucleic acid
   molecule or expression product which other molecule either directly or indirectly modulates
   the expression or activity of the Type I IFN nucleic acid molecule or expression product,
   respectively. Accordingly, the method of the present invention encompasses the regulation of
10 Type I IFN nucleic acid molecule expression or expression product activity via the induction
   of a cascade of regulatory steps.
            "Derivatives" of the molecules herein described include fragments, parts, portions or
   variants from either natural or non-natural sources. Non-natural sources include, for example,
   recombinant or synthetic sources. By "recombinant sources" is meant that the cellular source
15 from which the subject molecule is harvested has been genetically altered. This may occur, for
   example, in order to increase or otherwise enhance the rate and volume of production by that
   particular cellular source. Parts or fragments include, for example, active regions of the
   molecule. Derivatives may be derived from insertion, deletion or substitution of amino acids.
   Amino acid insertional derivatives include amino and/or carboxylic terminal fusions as well as
20 intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acids. Insertional amino acid sequence
   variants are those in which one or more amino acid residues are introduced into a
   predetermined site in the protein although random insertion is also possible with suitable
   screening of the resulting product. Deletional variants are characterised by the removal of one
   or more amino acids from the sequence. Substitutional amino acid variants are those in which
25 at least one residue in a sequence has been removed and a different residue inserted in its
   place. Additions to amino acid sequences include fusions with other peptides, polypeptides or
   proteins, as detailed above.
            Derivatives also include fragments having particular epitopes or parts of the entire
   protein fused to peptides, polypeptides or other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous molecules.
30 Analogues of the molecules contemplated herein include, but are not limited to, modification
   to side chains, incorporating of unnatural amino acids and/or their derivatives during peptide,
   polypeptide or protein synthesis and the use of crosslinkers and other methods which impose
   conformational constraints on the proteinaceous molecules or their analogues.

                                                  - 41
           Derivatives of nucleic acid sequences which may be utilised in accordance with the
   method of the present invention may similarly be derived from single or multiple nucleotide
   substitutions, deletions and/or additions including fusion with other nucleic acid molecules.
   The derivatives of the nucleic acid molecules utilised in the present invention include
 5 oligonucleotides, PCR primers, antisense molecules, molecules suitable for use in
   cosuppression and fusion of nucleic acid molecules. Derivatives of nucleic acid sequences
   also include degenerate variants.
           A "variant" or "mutant" of Type I IFN should be understood to mean molecules which
   exhibit at least some of the functional activity of the form of Type I IFN of which it is a variant
10 or mutant. A variation or mutation may take any form and may be naturally or non-naturally
   occurring.
           A "homologue" is meant that the molecule is derived from a species other than that
   which is being treated in accordance with the method of the present invention. This may
   occur, for example, where it is determined that a species other than that which is being treated
15 produces a form of Type I IFN, for example, which exhibits similar and suitable functional
   characteristics to that of the Type I IFN which is naturally produced by the subject undergoing
   treatment.
            Chemical and functional equivalents should be understood as molecules exhibiting any
   one or more of the functional activities of the subject molecule, which functional equivalents
20 may be derived from any source such as being chemically synthesised or identified via
   screening processes such as natural product screening. For example chemical or functional
   equivalents can be designed and/or identified utilising well known methods such as
   combinatorial chemistry or high throughput screening of recombinant libraries or following
   natural product screening.
25         For example, libraries containing small organic molecules may be screened, wherein
   organic molecules having a large number of specific parent group substitutions are used. A
   general synthetic scheme may follow published methods (eg., Bunin BA, et al. (1994) Proc.
   Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91:4708-4712; DeWitt SH, et al. (1993) Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,
   90:6909-6913). Briefly, at each successive synthetic step, one of a plurality of different
30 selected substituents is added to each of a selected subset of tubes in an array, with the
   selection of tube subsets being such as to generate all possible permutation of the different
   substituents employed in producing the library. One suitable permutation strategy is outlined
   in US. Patent No. 5,763,263.

                                                     - 42
            There is currently widespread interest in using combinational libraries of random
   organic molecules to search for biologically active compounds (see for example U.S. Patent
   No. 5,763,263). Ligands discovered by screening libraries of this type may be useful in
   mimicking or blocking natural ligands or interfering with the naturally occurring ligands of a
 5 biological target. In the present context, for example, they may be used as a starting point for
   developing Type I IFN analogues which exhibit properties such as more potent
   pharmacological effects. Type I IFN or a functional part thereof may according to the present
   invention be used in combination libraries formed by various solid-phase or solution-phase
   synthetic methods (see for example U.S. Patent No. 5,763,263 and references cited therein).
10 By use of techniques, such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,753,187, millions of new
   chemical and/or biological compounds may be routinely screened in less than a few weeks. Of
   the large number of compounds identified, only those exhibiting appropriate biological activity
   are further analysed.
            With respect to high throughput library screening methods, oligomeric or small
15 molecule library compounds capable of interacting specifically with a selected biological
   agent, such as a biomolecule, a macromolecule complex, or cell, are screened utilising a
   combinational library device which is easily chosen by the person of skill in the art from the
   range of well-known methods, such as those described above. In such a method, each member
   of the library is screened for its ability to interact specifically with the selected agent. In
20 practising the method, a biological agent is drawn into compound-containing tubes and
   allowed to interact with the individual library compound in each tube. The interaction is
   designed to produce a detectable signal that can be used to monitor the presence of the desired
   interaction. Preferably, the biological agent is present in an aqueous solution and further
   conditions are adapted depending on the desired interaction. Detection may be performed for
25 example by any well-known functional or non-functional based method for the detection of
   substances.
            Analogues of Type I IFN contemplated herein include, but are not limited to,
   modifications to side chains, incorporating unnatural amino acids and/or derivatives during
   peptide, polypeptide or protein synthesis and the use of crosslinkers and other methods which
30 impose conformational constraints on the analogues. The specific form which such
   modifications can take will depend on whether the subject molecule is proteinaceous or non
   proteinaceous. The nature and/or suitability of a particular modification can be routinely
   determined by the person of skill in the art.

                                                   - 43
            Modulation of said Type I IFN functional levels may be achieved via the
   administration of Type I IFN, a nucleic acid molecule encoding Type I IFN or an agent which
   effects modulation of Type I IFN activity or Type I IFN gene expression (herein collectively
   referred to as "modulatory agents").
 5          Administration of a composition of the present invention in the form of a
   pharmaceutical composition, may be performed by any convenient means. The components of
   the pharmaceutical composition are contemplated to exhibit therapeutic or prophylactic
   activity when administered in an amount which depends on the particular case. The variation
   depends, for example, on the human or animal. A broad range of doses may be applicable.
10 Dosage regimes may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example,
   several divided doses may be administered daily, weekly, monthly or other suitable time
   intervals or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the
   situation.
             The composition may be administered in a convenient manner such as by the oral,
15 inhaled, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, suppository routes or implanting (e.g. using slow
   release molecules). It may also be administered via non-mucosal routes, where appropriate,
   such as via intravenous or other such routes. The composition may be administered in the form
   of pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salts, such as acid addition salts or metal complexes,
   e.g. with zinc, iron or the like (which are considered as salts for purposes of this application).
20 Illustrative of such acid addition salts are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, phosphate,
   maleate, acetate, citrate, benzoate, succinate, malate, ascorbate, tartrate and the like. If the
   active ingredient is to be administered in tablet form, the tablet may contain a binder such as
   tragacanth, corn starch or gelatin; a disintegrating agent, such as alginic acid; and a lubricant,
   such as magnesium stearate.
25           The modulatory agents of the invention can be combined with a pharmaceutically
   acceptable carrier (excipient) to form a pharmacological composition. Pharmaceutically
   acceptable carriers can contain a physiologically acceptable compound that acts to, e.g.,
   stabilize, or increase or decrease the absorption or clearance rates of the pharmaceutical
   compositions of the invention. Physiologically acceptable compounds can include, e.g.,
30 carbohydrates, such as glucose, sucrose, or dextrans, antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid or
   glutathione, chelating agents, low molecular weight proteins, compositions that reduce the
   clearance or hydrolysis of the peptides or polypeptides, or excipients or other stabilizers and/or
   buffers. Detergents can also used to stabilize or to increase or decrease the absorption of the

                                                    - 44
   pharmaceutical composition, including liposomal carriers. Pharmaceutically acceptable
   carriers and formulations for peptides and polypeptide are known to the skilled artisan and are
   described in detail in the scientific and patent literature, see e.g., the latest edition of
   Remington's Pharmaceutical Science, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania
 5 ("Remington's").
            Other physiologically acceptable compounds include wetting agents, emulsifying
   agents, dispersing agents or preservatives which are particularly useful for preventing the
   growth or action of microorganisms. Various preservatives are well known and include, e.g.,
   phenol and ascorbic acid. One skilled in the art would appreciate that the choice of a
10 pharmaceutically acceptable carrier including a physiologically acceptable compound depends,
   for example, on the route of administration of the peptide or polypeptide of the invention and
   on its particular physio-chemical characteristics.
            Solid formulations can be used for enteral (oral) administration. They can be
   formulated as, e.g., pills, tablets, powders or capsules. For solid compositions, conventional
15 nontoxic solid carriers can be used which include, e.g., pharmaceutical grades of mannitol,
   lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose,
   magnesium carbonate, and the like. For oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable
   nontoxic composition is formed by incorporating any of the normally employed excipients,
   such as those carriers previously listed. A non-solid formulation can also be used for enteral
20 administration. The carrier can be selected from various oils including those of petroleum,
   animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and
   the like. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include e.g., starch, cellulose, talc, glucose,
   lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate, sodium
   stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol,
25 water, ethanol.
            The composition of the invention, when administered orally, can be protected from
   digestion. This can be accomplished either by complexing the composition with a composition
   to render it resistant to acidic and enzymatic hydrolysis or by packaging these molecules in an
   appropriately resistant carrier such as a liposome. Means of protecting compounds from
30 digestion are well known in the art, see, e.g., Fix (1996) Pharm Res. 13:1760-1764; Samanen
   (1996) J. Pharm. Pharmacol.48:119-135; U.S. Patent 5,391,377, describing lipid
   compositions for oral delivery of therapeutic agents (liposomal delivery is discussed in further
   detail, infra).

                                                  - 45
            The composition of the invention can also be administered in sustained delivery or
   sustained release mechanisms, which can deliver the formulation internally. For example,
   biodegradable microspheres or capsules or other biodegradable polymer configurations
   capable of sustained delivery of a peptide can be included in the formulations of the invention
 5 (see, e.g., Putney (1998) Nat. Biotechnol. 16:153-157).
            For inhalation, the composition of the invention can be delivered using any system
   known in the art, including dry powder aerosols, liquid delivery systems, air jet nebulisers,
   propellant systems, and the like. See, e.g., Patton (1998) Biotechniques 16:141-143; product
   and inhalation delivery systems for polypeptide macromolecules by, e.g., Dura
10 Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA) , Aradigm (Hayward, CA), Aerogen (Santa Clara, CA),
   Inhale Therapeutic Systems (San Carlos, CA), and the like. For example, the Type I IFN
   formulation can be administered in the form of an aerosol or mist. For aerosol administration,
   the formulation can be supplied in finely divided form along with a surfactant and propellant.
   In another aspect, the device for delivering the formulation to respiratory tissue is an inhaler in
15 which the formulation vaporizes. Other liquid delivery systems include, e.g., air jet nebulisers.
            The Type I IFN will be formulated in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions
   suitable for pulmonary or respiratory delivery to a patient. Particular formulations include dry
   powders, liquid solutions or suspensions suitable for nebulisation, and propellant formulations
   suitable for use in metered dose inhalers (MDI's). The preparation of such formulations is well
20 described in the patent, scientific, and medical literatures, and the following descriptions are
   intended to be exemplary only.
            Liquid formulations of Type I IFN for use in nebuliser systems can include
   components to enhance or maintain chemical stability, including chelating agents, protease
   inhibitors, isotonic modifiers, inert gases, and the like.
25          For use in metered dose inhalers, the Type I IFN of the present invention will be
   dissolved or suspended in a suitable aerosol propellant, such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) or
   a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC). Suitable CFC's include trichloromonofluoromethane (propellant
    11), dichlorotetrafluoroethane (propellant 114), and dichlorodifluoromethane (propellant 12).
   Suitable HFC's include tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) and heptafluoropropane (HFC-227).
30          Preferably, for incorporation into the aerosol propellant, the Type I IFN of the present
   invention will be processed into respirable particles as described below for the dry powder
   formulations. The particles are then suspended in the propellant, typically being coated with a
   surfactant to enhance their dispersion. Suitable surfactants include oleic acid, sorbitan trioleate,

                                                  - 46
   and various long chain diglycerides and phospholipids.
            Such aerosol propellant formulations may further include a lower alcohol, such as
   ethanol (up to 30% by weight) and other additives to maintain or enhance chemical stability
   and physiological acceptability.
 5         Dry powder formulations will typically comprise the Type I IFN in a dry, usually
   lyophilized, form with a particular size within a preferred range for deposition within the
   alveolar region of the lung. Respirable powders of Type I IFN within the preferred size range
   can be produced by a variety of conventional techniques, such as jet-milling, spray-drying,
   solvent precipitation, and the like. Dry powders can then be administered to the patient in
10 conventional dry powder inhalers (DPI's) that use the inspiratory breath through the device to
   disperse the powder or in air-assisted devices that use an external power source to disperse the
   powder into an aerosol cloud.
           Dry powder devices typically require a powder mass in the range from about 1 mg to
    10 mg to produce a single aerosolized dose ("puff'). Since the required dose of Type I IFN
15 may be lower than this amount, the Type I IFN may be combined with a pharmaceutically
   acceptable dry bulking powder. Preferred dry bulking powders include sucrose, lactose,
   trehalose, human serum albumin (HSA), and glycine. Other suitable dry bulking powders
   include cellobiose, dextrans, maltotriose, pectin, sodium citrate, sodium ascorbate, mannitol,
   and the like. Typically, suitable buffers and salts may be used to stabilize the Type I IFN in
20 solution prior to particle formation. Suitable buffers include phosphate, citrate, acetate, and
   tris-HCl, typically at concentrations from about 5 mM to 50 mM. Suitable salts include
   sodium chloride, sodium carbonate, calcium chloride, and the like. Other additives, such as
   chelating agents, peptidase inhibitors, and the like, which would facilitate the biological
   activity of the Type I IFN once it is dissolved within the lung would be appropriate. For
25 example, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) would be useful as a chelator for divalent
   cations which are peptidase cofactors.
           In preparing pharmaceuticals of the present invention, a variety of formulation
   modifications can be used and manipulated to alter pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. A
   number of methods for altering pharmacokinetics and biodistribution are known to one of
30 ordinary skill in the art. Examples of such methods include protection of the compositions of
   the invention in vesicles composed of substances such as proteins, lipids (for example,
   liposomes, see below), carbohydrates, or synthetic polymers (discussed above). For a general
   discussion of pharmacokinetics, see, e.g., Remington's, Chapters 37-39.

                                                   - 47
            The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered in a variety of
   unit dosage forms depending upon the method of administration. Dosages for typical
   modulatory pharmaceutical compositions are well known to those of skill in the art. Such
   dosages are typically advisorial in nature and are adjusted depending on the particular
 5 therapeutic context, patient tolerance, etc. The amount of modulatory agent adequate to
   accomplish this is defined as a "therapeutically effective dose." The dosage schedule and
   amounts effective for this use, i.e., the "dosing regimen," will depend upon a variety of factors,
   including the stage of the disease or condition, the severity of the disease or condition, the
   general state of the patient's health, the patient's physical status, age, pharmaceutical
10 formulation and concentration of active agent, and the like. In calculating the dosage regimen
   for a patient, the mode of administration also is taken into consideration. The dosage regimen
   must also take into consideration the pharmacokinetics, i.e., the pharmaceutical composition's
   rate of absorption, bioavailability, metabolism, clearance, and the like. See, e.g., the latest
   Remington's; Egleton (1997) "Bioavailability and transport of peptides and peptide drugs into
15 the brain" Peptides 18:1431-1439; Langer (1990) Science 249:1527-1533.
            The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions
   (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of
   sterile injectable solutions or dispersion or may be in the form of a cream or other form
   suitable for topical application. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and
20 storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as
   bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example,
   water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol,
   and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be
   maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the
25 required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of superfactants. The preventions
   of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal
   agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal and the like. In
   many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium
   chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use
30 in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and
   gelatin.
            Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the
   required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated

                                                  -48
   above, as required, followed by filtered sterilisation. Generally, dispersions are prepared by
   incorporating the various sterilised active ingredient into a sterile vehicle which contains the
   basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In
   the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred
 5 methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze-drying technique which yield a
   powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from previously sterile
   filtered solution thereof.
            The present invention is further described by reference to the following non-limiting
   examples.

   Methods
   Immunopurification
            Immunopurification was performed according to the protocol developed by Parker and
15 colleagues (Parker et al. 2008), with the epithelial selection antibody replaced by a-mouse-Ep
   CAM antibody (BD Pharmingen, clone G818). Purity of populations was assessed by RT
   PCR analysis for CD31, vWF and P1H12 (endothelial populations), CD45 (haemopoietic
   populations) and Ep-CAM, CK1 8 and CK1 9 (epithelial populations) and NeoR (tumour
   specific populations) (data not shown).
20 Microarray Analysis
            RNA was extracted using and RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was
   amplified, labelled and fragmented using a GC Gene Expression 3' Amplification, Two-cycle
   target labelling kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with the first In Vitro Transcription
   performed using an Megascript T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA).           Affymetrix Mouse 430
25 v2.0 gene expression arrays were used to determine expression levels. Data analysis was
   performed in Genespring GX 7.3 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Data was
   imported using an RMA file preprocessor and measurements less than 0.01 were set to 0.01. A
   per gene normalization of each matched spine metastatic epithelium sample and each primary
   tumour epithelium sample to the relevant primary tumour epithelium sample was performed.
30 The samples were grouped by tissue type. A confidence filter with the t-test p-value set to
   0.05 was used to minimize the number of genes in the data set that did not change expression
   between the primary tumour epithelium and the metastatic epithelium. An ANOVA
   (parametric test, not assuming equal variances) with a false discovery rate of 0.03 was used to

                                                    - 49
   identify differentially expressed genes. The full data set can be accessed online at GEO. Gene
   ontology analysis was performed using the gene ontology feature within Genespring GX 7.3,
   with the ontology table constructed using GenBank, LocusLink and UniGene. A focused
   promoter analysis using Genomatix (Genomatix Software GmbH, Munchen, Germany) was
 5 performed utilizing randomly selected genes from within the top three ontologies. The
   interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) consensus binding sequence was then used to
   perform an unfocused promoter analysis on the differentially expressed genes within
   Genespring GT 1.0 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with the sequence data
   sourced from the MouseGenome9999 sequence file (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
10 USA).
   INTERFEROME Analysis
            Expression data was filtered by p value < 0.05 and fold-change > 2 to identify genes
   strongly differentially expressed between primary tumour epithelium and the metastatic
   epithelium. Genes were mapped to Ensembl release 59 gene models and the resulting gene list
15 was analysed for IFN signatures using INTERFEROME, the database of IFN regulated genes.
   Significance was determined by the application of a Pearson chi-squared test.
   Transcription Factor Binding Site Enrichment Analysis
            Putative proximal promoter sequences 1500bp 5' upstream and 200bp downstream
   relative to the annotated transcription start site were extracted from Ensembl release 59
20 through the Ensembl Bioperl API (Culhane et al. 2010, supra). The CLOVER algorithm (Frith
   et al., Nucleic Acids Res 32:1372-1381 (2004)) utilizing the Transfac Professional (ver.
   2010.3) position weight matrices as described previously (Matys et al., Nucleic Acids Res
   34:D108-110 (2006)) were employed to identify transcription factor enrichment within the
   gene set. Promoters from the complete INTERFEROME gene list and 22732 Ensembl protein
25 coding genes were employed as background sets with p-value thresholds of 0.01 and 1000
   randomizations applied. Transcription factor binding site identification was performed using
   the MATCH algorithm of Transfac Professional (ver. 2010.3) with filters applied to minimize
   false positives. Transcription factor binding sites were visualized through the INTERFEROME
   promoter visualization scripts.
30          Promoter enrichment analysis using and binding site identification was performed on
   the 540 suppressed genes identified through INTERFEROME analysis. Transfac Pro 2010.3
   matrices were applied in both the CLOVER and MATCH algorithms.
   Cell Culture and Molecular Techniques

                                                   - 50
            66c4 and 4T 1 cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Fred Miller (Karmanos Cancer
   Institute, Detroit, MI). Derivation of the 4T 1.2 line has previously been described (Eckhardt et
   al. 2005, supra; Lelekakis et al. 1999, supra). Recombinant Interferon-ai was used at a dose
   of 1000 IU/mL. Interferon-a receptor blocking antibody (MAR1-5A3) was used at a
 5 concentration of 10pg/mL (Leinco, St Louis, MO). G-CSF ELISA was performed according
   to manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Flow cytometry was
   performed using standard techniques. MDSCs were assessed using Ly6G (clone IA8) and
   CD1 lb (clone M1/70) specific antibodies (BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at a
   dilution of 1:200. Flow Cytometry was performed using an LSR-II (BD Pharmingen, San
10 Jose, CA). Real-time RT-PCR was performed using standard techniques. In vitro proliferation
   was assessed using a sulforhodamine B binding assay as previously described (Eckhardt et al.
   2005, supra). Immunohistochemistry was performed using standard techniques, using a
   mouse Irf7 (Zymed/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) a-human Irf7 (BD Pharmingen, Franklin
   Lakes, NJ, USA) at a concentration of 5pg/mL.
15 CFSE T-lymphocyte Suppression Assay
            The mixture of MDSC and CFSE labelled splenocytes were plated in triplicates in a
   96-well round-bottom plate. The suppressor and responder cells were cultured together at
   ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 and 1:16 with the same number of responder cells in each well
   (100,000 cells/well). Cells were stimulated using anti-CD3 (clone 145-2c 11, BD Biosciences,
20 San Jose, CA, USA) and anti-CD28 (clone 37.51, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA)
   antibodies at 40ng/ml. The total volume of medium in each well was adjusted to 175 [d. Cells
   were incubated at 370 C for 72 h, and the cell proliferation was measured by CFSE dilution
   using flow cytometry. CD4' and CD8' T-lymphocytes were assessed using specific antibodies
   (anti-mouse CD4-APC, clone GK1.5, eBioscience; anti-mouse CD8a PE-Cy7, clone 53-6.7,
25 eBioscience)
   Mouse Assays
            Female Balb/c mice (6-8 weeks old) were obtained from ARC (Perth, WA, Australia)
   or Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (Kew, Vic, Australia) breeding facilities. Female NSG mice
   were obtained from WEHI breeding facility under license from The Jackson Laboratory and
30 Balb/c Ifnarl1 (Hwang et al. 1995, supra) were bred in-house. Recombinant IFN-al was
   injected intraperitoneally 3 times weekly at a dose of 105 IU/dose. All other mouse assays
   were performed using standard techniques. Metastasis was assessed using a previously
   described assay (Eckhardt et al. 2005, supra). Mouse investigations were performed with the

                                                   -51
   approval of the Peter MacCallum Animal Ethics Experimentation Committee.

   all statistics are Student's T-test performed on untransformed data. Dot plots and histograms
 5 are means and error bars are S.E.M.. All statistics were performed using the data analysis

   survival analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 and the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon
   test was used to determine significance. Four publicly available breast cancer microarray
   datasets with known first site of distant relapse were used in the survival analyses: GSE2034,
10 GSE12276, GSE2603, NK1295 as described in Harrell et al. (2012, supra). The Irf7 gene set
   was treated as a continuous variable and is defined as the averaged gene expression of the
   subgroup of 208 genes within the 540 IRGs that contained predicted Irf7 putative binding sites
   (including Irf7, Figure 7).
   Immunopurification
15           Immunopurification was performed according to the protocol developed by Parker and
   colleagues (Parker et al. 2008, supra; Parkeret al., CancerRes 64:7857-7866 (2004); St Croix
   et al., Science (New York, N. Y) 289:1197-1202 (2000)), with the epithelial selection antibody
   replaced by a-mouse-Ep-CAM antibody (BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Briefly,
   mice were sacrificed and tissues collected. Tissues were disaggregated in DMEM containing
20 3mg/mL Collagenase A (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and digested for 90
   min at 370 C prior to filtration through a 100pm and a 70pm nylon filter and red blood cell
   lysis in an alkaline buffer (150mM NH 4 Cl, 1mM KHCO 3, 0.1mM EDTA). B lymphocytes and
   T lymphocytes were removed by incubation with pan-B and pan-T DynaBeads (Invitrogen,
   Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 20 min at 4'C. Epithelial cells were then selected by incubation with
25 sheep anti-rat DynaBeads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) pre-conjugated to a rat anti-mouse
   EP-CAM antibody (BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for 30 min at 4'C.
   Enforced Gene Expression
             We used the pMSCV retroviral expression vector (Clonetech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) to
   enforce the expression of Irf7. Empty plasmid or plasmid containing a flag tagged Irf7
30 construct was transfected into HEK-293 packaging cells using lipofectamine (Invitrogen,
   Carlsbad, CA, USA). Conditioned media was filtered and incubated with target 4T1.2 cells.
   4T1.2 cells were then selected using puromycin, single cell cloned and multiple clones pooled.
   Distant-metastases survival analyses using gene expression datasets

                                                   - 52
            Four publicly available breast cancer microarray datasets with known first site of
   distant relapse were used in the survival analyses: GSE2034, GSE12276, GSE2603, NK1295
   as previously described in Harrell et al. (2012, supra). Normalised gene expression data was
   downloaded. The Irf7 gene signature was treated as a continuous variable and is defined as the
 5 averaged gene expression of the 208 genes within the 540 IRGs that contained predicted Irf7
   putative binding sites and (including Irf7, Figure 7). Probes were mapped to EntrezGenelDs
   and when multiple probes existed, the probe with the highest variance was used. Gene
   expression values were scaled such that the quantiles 2.5% and 97.5% equalled -1 and +1
   respectively. This scaling is robust to outliers and allows comparison between microarray
10 datasets (Haibe-Kains et al., JNatl CancerInst 104:311-325 (2012)). A Cox proportional
   regression model were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for distant
   relapse to bone in relation to the expression of the Irf7 signature as a continuous variable with
   adjustment for classic prognostic factors: tumour size (TI vs T2), nodal status (positive vs
   negative), estrogen receptor status (positive vs negative) and histological grade (Grade 1 vs 2
15 vs 3) stratified according to dataset, using the change in the likelihood ratio x2 value. The
   Kaplan-Meier method was used to draw survival curves and the log-rank p test used to
   evaluate for differences in survival across the strata. In total, there were patient data for 855
   patients with as first site of relapse bone (n=238), brain (n=49), lung (n=101) and liver
   (n= 107). For analyses of bone relapse free survival, non-bone events (i.e. liver, lung and brain)
20 were censored (and vice-versa for the non-bone survival analyses). Note that analyses
   separately for brain, lung and liver relapse-free survivals were also not significant (log-rank P=
   0.4, 0.8 and 0.56 respectively). Correlations were performed using a Spearman's Rho statistic
   (Rs). Analyses were performed using R version 2.9.2 (http://www.r-project.org/) and SPSS
   (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL) version 20.0.
25 Real-time RT-PCR (RNA Expression Analysis)
            RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and reverse
   transcribed cDNA using standard techniques. Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR
   reagent (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The following primer sequences were
   used:
30          GAPDH            Fwd 5'-TCCCACTCTTCCACCTTCGA-3' (SEQ ID NO:1)
                             Rev 5'-GTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3' (SEQ ID NO:2),
            Irf7             Fwd 5'-CCACACCCCCATCTTCGA-3' (SEQ ID NO:3)
                             Rev 5'- CCTCCGAGCCCGAAACTC-3' (SEQ ID NO:4),

                                                  - 53
            Irf9            Fwd 5'-GCTCTAGCCATAGCCAAGAGAATC-3' (SEQ ID NO:5)
                            Rev 5'- TCCAGTAAATGTCGGGCAAAG-3' (SEQ ID NO:6),
            STAT1           Fwd 5'-CGCGCATGCAACTGGCATATAACT-3' (SEQ ID NO:7)
                            Rev 5'- AAGCTCGAACCACTGTGACATCCT-3' (SEQ ID NO:8),
 5          G-CSF           Fwd 5'- AGGTACGAAATGGCCAGGACA-3' (SEQ ID NO:9)
                            Rev 5'- TGGCAGCAGATGGAAAACCTAG-3' (SEQ ID NO:10).
            Expression level of each gene was calculated based on the cycle threshold (CT), set
   within the linear range of DNA amplification. Expression level (arbitrary units) was calculated
   as relative transcript abundance (RTA) by: RTA = 10000 / (2 ACT), where ACT = CT(gene of
10 interest) - CT(GAPDH).
   Mouse Metastasis, Survival Assays and in vivo depletion of antibodies
            These techniques have previously been described by Eckhardt and colleagues
   (Eckhardt 2005). Briefly, mice were inoculated with 105 cells into the  4 th mammary fatpad of
   female 6-8 week old Balb/c mice. Tumour volumes were monitored by caliper measurement 3
15 times weekly. All animals were sacrificed by isoflurane overdose when any animal showed
   signs of distress (usually ds 28 -35). Metastatic burden in secondary tissues was detected by a
   Q-PCR based assay using a reporter sequence inserted into the genome of the 4T 1.2 cells.
   Survival assays were conducted in the same way except at day 22 the mice were anaesthetized
   using either a combination of ketamine hydrochloride (1.2pig/g of mouse)/xylaxil
20 hydrochloride (3pig/g of mouse) or 2.5% aerosol isoflurane in 100% oxygen and the primary
   tumour was surgically removed and weighed. Mice were harvested individually, not as a
   group, when they showed signs of distress. At time of sacrifice, all mice had evidence of bone
   and lung metastasis unless otherwise stated. Anti-CD8 (clone 53-6.7, produced in house) and
   the control antibody rat IgG2a (clone 2A3, produced in house) were injected intraperitoneally
25 at 50 tg per dose on days -1, 0, 1, 4, 7 and subsequently every 7 d. Rabbit anti-asialo GM1
   was purchased from Wako chemicals and injected intraperitoneally according to the
   manufacturer's instructions.
   Histology and Immunohistochemistry
            With one exception, all tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h.
30 Bones were decalcified in 20% EDTA for 14 d at room temperature. All tissues were paraffin
   embedded and sectioned by the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre histology facility or Peter
   MacCallum Cancer Centre Pathology Division. H&E staining was also performed by the same
   histology facility. The exception was a separate series of tissue microarrays constructed by

                                                 - 54
   P.A. at The Johns Hopkins Hospital from paired primary breast carcinomas and hematogenous
   metastases from the same patients, most of which were harvested at rapid autopsy as
   previously described (Wu et al. 2008; Cimino et al., Breast CancerRes Treat 123:701-708
   (2010)). Standard immunohistochemistry techniques were used to prepare the sections for
 5 staining. Heat antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer (10mM tri-sodium citrate, pH
   6.0) at 125'C for 3 min under pressure. a-mouse Irf7 antibody was obtained from Invitrogen
   (clone zm7), a-human/mouse Irf9 antibody from abcam (cat# ab51634) and a-human Irf7
   antibody from BD Pharmingen (cat#AHP 1179).
   Interferon- aELISA
10         IFN-c ELISA was performed using standard molecular biology techniques. Antibody
   clone RMMA-1 was used as the capture antibody (PBL Interferon Source, Piscataway, NJ,
   USA) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse IFN-ac was used as the detection antibody (PBL
   Interferon Source, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Cells were seeded at a density of 50,000/mL and
   allowed to adhere for 4 h before being treated with vehicle control or 10 g/mL of poly(I:C) for
15 24 h.
   Ly6G* Cell Preparation (MDSC preparation)
           Mouse blood was harvest by cardiac puncture and the spleens were removed and single
   cell suspension was prepared. Red blood cells were lysed by resuspending the cells in 1 ml of
   red blood cell lysis buffer containing 150 mM NH 4 Cl, 1mM KHCO 3 and 0.1mM EDTA at
20 room temperature for five min. Cells were then washed twice and resuspended at 5x 107
   cells/ml in FACS buffer containing 0.1% sodium azide, 2% FCS and 2mM EDTA. Ly6G'
   MDSC cells were selected based on their expression of Ly6G and CD1 lb (Ly6G'CD11 b).
   Cell sorting was performed using the FACSDiVa cell sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
   USA) and FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Unlabelled samples
25 and single labelled controls for each fluorochrome were included for setting voltage and
   compensation parameters.
   CFSE Labelling
            Splenocyte single cell suspension was prepared. Cells were resuspended in 20 mL PBS
   containing 2 mM EDTA and subsequently labelled with 1 [tM CFSE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
30 CA, USA). After a seven-min incubation at room temperature, the tube was filled up with c
   MEM containing 5% FCS and spun at 800 g for five min. After being washed twice, the cells
   were then resuspended in c-MEM containing 5% FCS. The labelling of cells by CFSE was

                                                 - 55
   analyzed by flow cytometry.
   MS-HRM
   DNA samples
            Sections were cut from eight blocks containing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
 5 (FFPE) normal mammary tissue, primary tumours and matched bone metastases. One 3 pm
   section from each block was stained with H&E to identify the tumour enriched area. The
   content of tumour cells in all cases was assessed by a pathologist. Tissue areas consisting of at
   least 80% tumour cell content were selected for needle macrodissection. Seven pm tissue
   sections of each sample were stained with methyl green and subsequently subjected to needle
10 macrodissection.
           DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
   Germany) according to Wu et. al. (Wu et al., Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol 10:269
   274 (2002)) with slight modifications. Briefly, needle macrodissected tissue from each sample
   was transferred immediately to a 1.5 mL screw tube containing 100 pL Tissue Lysis Buffer
15 ATL (Qiagen) and incubated at 98'C for 15 min. Subsequently the tube was cooled to room
   temperature, 12 pL proteinase K (20 mg/mL) (Worthington Biochemical Corporation,
   Lakewood, NJ) was added and incubated at 56'C for 72 h. Every 24 h an additional 12 pL
   proteinase K (20 mg/mL) was added. Following incubation, 110 pL Lysis Buffer AL was
   added and incubated at 72'C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was cooled to room
20 temperature, 110 pL ethanol was added and the mixture transferred into a QIAamp Mini Spin
   Column (Qiagen) for DNA elution as per manufacturer's instructions.
           DNA was quantified and its purity assessed using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer
   2000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE). The purity of all
   DNA samples extracted had an absorbance A260/A 280 ratio of between 1.8 and 1.9.
25 SssI treatment
           Fully methylated control DNA was prepared from 500 ng of extracted lung DNA of a
   normal BALB/c mouse by utilising the CpG Methyltransferase M.SssI (New England
   BioLabs, Ipswich, MA). M.SssI treatment was performed as described elsewhere (Mikeska et
   al., Methods Mol. Biol. 791:33-53 (2011)). The preparation was stored at -35'C.
30 Bisulfite treatment
           Five hundred ng of DNA were bisulfite modified using the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit
   (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The SssI treated DNA (fully methylated
   control DNA) and the corresponding genomic DNA (unmethylated control DNA) was eluted

                                                   - 56
   twice in a final volume of 50 pL Elution Buffer EB, whereas FFPE-derived DNA was eluted
   twice in a final volume of 40 pL Elution Buffer EB. The eluate was stored at 4'C.
   Methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM)
            A DNA methylation standard series was prepared by diluting fully methylated control
 5 DNA in unmethylated control DNA. The DNA methylation standards comprised 100% 50%,
   25%, 10% and 0% of fully methylated control DNA. MS-HRM (Wojdacz and Dobrovic,
   Nucleic Acids Res 35:e41 (2007)) was performed on a Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett, Sydney,
   Australia). Each DNA methylation standard and each sample was run in duplicate, while the
   bisulfite untreated genomic DNA control and the no template control were performed only
10 once.
            The primer sequences for the analysis of the CpG rich region spanning exon 1 of Irf7
   were: 5'-GAGTGGTTTAAGAGTTTTATATATTTGGTAT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 11) and 5'
   ACCACACCCTACCTAAACTCTA-3' (SEQ ID NO:12) (Region 1). The amplified region
   corresponds to GenBank accession number AC 163434, nucleotides 62597-62727. The primer

   CTCAATATAAATTCCTCTACCAAAATAACTA-3'                         (SEQ ID NO:16) for region 3. The
20 amplified regions correspond to GenBank accession number AC 163434, nucleotides 62250
   62388 (Region 2) and nucleotides 62152-62275 (Region 3). PCR was performed in 0.1 mL
   tubes with a final reaction volume of 20 pL containing 200 nmol/L of each primer, 200 pmol/L
   of each dNTP, 5 pmol/L SYTO 9 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), 2.5 mmol/L
   MgCl 2 (2.0 mmol/L for region 3), 0.5 U HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase in its supplied buffer

   60'C (57'C for region 2 and 57.5'C for region 3) for 20 s (15 s for region 3) and 72'C (70'C
   for region 3) for 25 s (20 s for region 3). This was immediately followed by a hold at 97'C for
    1 min, 60'C for 1.5 min and a HRM step from 60 to 95'C rising at 0.2'C per second, and
30 holding for 1 sec after each stepwise increment.

10 Results
   Profiling of matched mammary tumours and spine metastases
            Tumour epithelial cells were isolated from 4T 1.2 primary tumours growing in the
   mammary gland and matched spine metastases (Eckhardt et al. 2005), as described previously
   (Parker et al., JPathol214:337-346 (2008)). Differences in gene expression profiles of tumour
15 cells isolated from four matched pairs of primary tumours and bone metastases (Fig. 1) were
   interrogated by gene ontology analysis and found to be highly enriched for immune and
   defense response ontologies (confidence level P < 0.003) (Table 3a).
            3,547 probes sets representing 3,061 genes were significantly down-regulated >2-fold
   in spine (P < 0.05), while 1,530 probes sets representing 1,012 genes were up-regulated (Fig.
20 1). Genes were unambiguously identified through Ensemble annotation (Culhane et al.,
   Nucleic Acids Research 38:D716-D725 (2010)). Analysis of the 3061 suppressed genes using
   the INTERFEROME database identified a high number (540) of IRGs (Fig. 1, Table 4) - a
   significant over-representation (P < 0.001). In contrast, there was no significant enrichment of
   IRGs in the up-regulated gene list. Promoter enrichment analysis of the INTERFEROME gene
25 set (540 genes) identified significant IRF and ISGF-3 enrichment (P < 0.001) and IRF/Irf7
   enrichment (P < 0.001) and further analysis identified that 208 of the 540 IRGs including Irf7,
   contained predicted Irf7 binding sites (Figure 7, 8).
            Irf7 is a major regulator of the type I IFN pathway (Honda et al., Nature 434:772-777
   (2005)) and was itself significantly suppressed in tumour cells from bone metastases (Table 5).
30 The expression of Irf7 in primary tumour epithelium and its loss in matched bone metastases
   was validated by real-time RT-PCR of epithelial mRNA (Fig. 2a, P < 0.00 1) and by
   immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2b). The dramatic suppression of both the Irf7 transcription
   factor and 208 putative target genes provided compelling argument for the functional

                                                   - 58
   importance of this innate signalling pathway.
            The mechanism of loss of Irf7 expression could be due to direct epigenetic
   modification (methylation) or a decrease in the expression of components of the ISGF3
   complex (containing STAT 1, STAT2 and Irf9) that directly regulates Irf7 expression (Lu et al.,
 5 JBiol Chem 275:31805-31812 (2000)). These results indicate the latter. Analysis of tumour
   cells macrodissected from primary tumours and matched spine metastases revealed no
   methylation at the CpG rich region spanning exon 1 or the boundary of intron 1 and exon 2 of
   Irf7 (Figure 9a-c). However, expression of ISGF3 components, STATI, Irf9 and STAT2 was
   reduced in bone metastases, correlating with Irf7 down-regulation (Table 5). The loss of
10 STAT 1 expression was not due to methylation (Figure 9d). Thus the mechanism of
   suppression of Irf7 expression is likely to be down-regulation of its upstream regulators, the
   ISGF3 transcriptional regulator complex. Consistent with this hypothesis, we detected nuclear
   localization of Irf9 in primary 4T1.2 tumours (Fig. 2b) indicative of ISGF3 translocation to the
   nucleus. By contrast, nuclear staining was barely detectable in bone metastases, mirroring that
15 of Irf7 expression (Fig. 2b).
   Irf7 restores type I IFN signalling and suppresses metastasis
            To determine the functional contribution of Irf7 in bone metastases, 4T1.2 clones were
   generated overexpressing Irf7 (4T1.2-Irf7, Figure 10a), which did not display altered
   proliferation in vitro (Figure 3a), even in the presence of pathway stimulation with IFN-a or a
20 TLR3 agonist (Poly I:C) (data not shown). The expected increased expression of IFN-a, by
   ELISA (Fig. 3b), and two IRGs, Irf9 and STAT 1, by qRT-PCR (Figure 10b) was confirmed.
   The latter was due to secondary signalling by type I IFN, because an Ifnarl neutralizing
   antibody (Sheehan et al., JInterferon Cytokine Res 26:804-819 (2006)) reduced Irf9 and
   STAT1 expression in 4T1.2-Irf7 cells to levels seen in control cells (4T1.2-BV) (Figure 10b).
25 In fact, microarray analysis of gene expression comparing 4T1.2-Irf7 to 4T1.2-BV cells
   revealed that all 208 genes that contained predicted Irf7 binding sites in their promoters were
   upregulated by Irf7 expression (Figure 11). Furthermore, there was an increase in nuclear Irf9
   expression in mammary tumours compared to 4T1.2-BV tumours (Figure 10c). Thus, the
   production of IFN by enforced Irf7 expression stimulates the IFN/Ifnar signal transduction
30 pathway.
            Restoration of the type I IFN pathway by enforced expression of Irf7 was demonstrated
   to reduce metastatic burden but not affect the primary tumour growth rates (Fig. 3c).
   Importantly, Irf7 overexpression resulted in a significant reduction in metastasis to spine (Fig.

                                                  - 59
   3d) measured by PCR and by histology. Spine macrometastases were detected in 60% of mice
   bearing 4T1.2-BV tumours, yet were undetectable in mice bearing 4T1.2-Irf7 tumours (Fig.
   3e).
            To confirm that the Irf7-mediated reduction in metastasis can prolong survival and is
 5 dependent on type I IFN signalling to host cells, 4T1.2-BV or 4T1.2-Irf7 cells were inoculated
   into Balb/c wildtype or Ifnarl] (Hwang et al., ProcNati Acad Sci USA 92:11284-11288
   (1995)) mice. Although there was no difference in primary tumour growth between all groups
   (Fig. 3f), enforced expression of Irf7 led to a significantly prolonged metastasis-free survival
   in wildtype mice (Fig. 3g). In contrast, Ifnarl-/- mice, succumbed to metastasis faster and
10 enforced Irf7 expression did not suppress metastasis (Fig. 3g), which were evident in all
   Ifnarl] animals (Fig. 3h).
            Taken together, these results demonstrate that tumour cell IFN signalling driven by Irf7
   reduces metastasis to bone, and the host response through Ifnarl is critical for metastasis
   suppression and associated prolonged survival.
15 Irf7 expression restores anti-metastatic immune responses
            Since the host IFN response is critical for metastasis suppression and the innate IFN
   pathway regulates the development and activity of immune effector cells (Dunn et al. 2005,
   supra), their potential role in this model was assessed by inoculating 4T1.2-BV or 4T1.2-Irf7
   cells into NOD-SCID IL-2ry4 mice (NSG). Again, primary tumours grew at the same rate,
20 suggesting primary tumour growth is not restrained by the immune system. Importantly, NSG
   mice lacking mature lymphocytes succumbed to metastasis more rapidly than syngeneic WT
   Balb/c mice and disease-free survival was not extended by expression of Irf7 (Fig. 4a) - in
   contrast to the outcome in immunocompetent mice where Irf7 had a significant survival benefit
   (Fig. 4a). These data demonstrate that functional immune cells are necessary for Irf7
25 protection against metastasis. Histological examination revealed spine metastases in all
   immunocompromised animals (Fig. 4b), consistent with their reduced survival. These results
   demonstrate that metastatic tumours are restrained by the immune system and that Irf7
   possibly suppresses metastasis by restoring anti-tumour immune responses without impacting
   on primary tumour growth.
30          To determine the immune cells mediating the Irf7-regulated modulation of bone
   metastases, systemic parameters of immune function were examined. Mice bearing 4T1.2-BV
   tumours have a marked elevation of peripheral white blood cells (WBCs) and splenomegaly
   compared to naYve mice. This response was reduced in mice bearing 4T1.2-Irf7 tumours

                                                  - 60
   (Figure 12). Previous studies in the 4T1 model have detected an increase in myeloid-derived
   suppressor cells (MDSC) which suppress immune surveillance to promote tumour growth
   (Yang et al., Cancer Cell 13:23-35 (2008); DuPre and Hunter, Exp Mol Pathol 82:12-24
   (2007). Gr1'CD1 1b' MDSC were measured in the peripheral blood of tumour bearing mice
 5 and detected a significant increase of this population in mice bearing the highly metastatic
   4T1.2 tumours relative to 4T1.2-Irf7 or the non-bone metastatic variant, 66c4 (Fig. 4c).
   MDSC infiltration into 4T1.2-Irf and 4T1.2-BV tumours was also visualized by
   immunohistochemical staining for Grl-expressing cells (Figure 13a). Grl1 cells were
   detected to a greater extent in bone metastases from mice bearing 4T 1.2-BV tumours (Figure
10 13b). Bone metastases from 4T1.2-Irf tumour-bearing mice were not detected. As MDSC
   consist of two major subsets, Ly6G'CD1 1b' neutrophil-like MDSC and the Ly6G-CD1 1b'
   monocytic MDSC (Youn et al., JImmunol 181:5791-5802 (2008)), both populations were
   measured revealing a marked increase of Ly6Ghi neutrophillic MDSC in all 4T1.2 tumour
   bearing mice. The percentage Ly6G'CD11b' cells were significantly reduced in 4T1.2-Irf7
15 compared to 4T1.2-BV mice (Figure 14). To demonstrate the activity of Ly6G'CD1 1b'
   MDSC, they were isolated from 4T1.2-bearing mice and demonstrated to inhibit proliferation
   of CD4' or CD8' T-lymphocytes (Fig. 4d). These data demonstrate that the MDSC population
   reduced in 4T1.2-Irf7 tumour-bearing mice is functionally capable of suppressing lymphocyte
   activity.
20          Previous reports linked tumour MDSC with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G
   CSF) (Waight et al., PLoS One 6:e27690 (2011); Adeegbe et al., Cell Transplant20:941-954
   (2011)). Significantly lower primary tumour and plasma levels of G-CSF were found in
   4T1.2-Irf7 tumour-bearing mice than in 4T1.2-BV or non-bone metastatic 66c4 tumour
   bearing animals (Figure 15). The reduction of MDSC in 4T1.2-Irf7 tumour-bearing mice,
25 along with the ability of type I IFNs to directly enhance T cell and NK cell effector functions
   (Hervas-Stubbs et al., Clin CancerRes 17:2619-2627 (2011)) suggests that enhanced tumour
   cell recognition may be involved in the suppression of metastasis mediated by Irf7. Consistent
   with this, a significant increase in CD4', CD8' and NK cell populations was observed in the
   peripheral blood of mice bearing 4T1.2-Irf7 tumours compared to 4T1.2-BV (Fig. 4e) at early
30 time points, when cells are likely to have intravasated into the circulation but are yet to form
   metastases. To test their function, CD8' T cells and NK cells were depleted from 4T1.2-Irf7
   tumour- and 4T1.2-BV tumour-bearing mice. As with all previous in vivo experiments,
   primary tumour growth was unaltered by depletion of either or both cell types (Fig. 4f).

                                                   - 61
   However, depletion of both CD8' T cells and NK cells significantly accelerated metastasis and
   shortened survival (Fig. 4g), indicating that both of these effector cells contribute to the
   Irf7/IFN-mediated control of metastases. Importantly, an obvious increase in paralysis in these
   mice caused by the development of bone metastases was observed and was confirmed by
 5 histology (Figure 16). In summary, these data confirm that Irf7 induced IFN-dependent
   immune suppression of metastasis to bone was dependent on CD8' T cells and NK cells.
   IRF7pathway in human breast cancer
            The expression of IRF7 in primary tumours and its loss in distant metastases, including
   bone, was verified by IHC using tissue arrays derived from the Rapid Autopsy Program, Johns
10 Hopkins Hospital (Wu et al., Clin CancerRes 14:1938-1946 (2008)). In these cases, it was
   demonstrated that IRF7 was frequently expressed in normal breast tissue (7/10) and in primary
   tumours (9/16). Importantly, reduced IRF7 expression was observed in metastases, with only
    16.7% of distant metastases expressing IRF7 (3/18), (P < 0.04 relative to primary tumours,
   Table 6). Analysis of matched primary tumours and bone metastases within this cohort
15 revealed that of 9 pairs, 7 primaries expressed IRF7, only one of which retained expression in
   the matched bone metastasis (representative images in Fig. 5a,b). As also shown in mouse
   tissues (Fig. 2b), bone osteocytes expressed IRF7 whereas the tumour cells were negative in
   most cases.
            In order to determine the clinical relevance of the IRF7 pathway in human breast
20 cancers, publicly available gene expression datasets of 855 primary tumours with known
   location of first site of distant metastases were used (Minn et al. Nature 436:518-524 (2005);
   Harrell et al. Breast Cancer Res Treat 132:523-535 (2012)). Using the 208 genes previously
   predicted as being Irf7-regulated (Fig. 1, Figure 7) associations between this Irf7 signature,
   relapses to bone and non-bone as the first site of distant metastases were evaluated.
25 Interestingly, it was found that the Irf7 signature was significantly associated with bone
   metastases-free survival in a linear manner, with low expression of the Irf7-gene set associated
   with increased bone metastatic events (Fig. Sc) whereas no relationship was observed for other
   sites (brain, lung and liver, Fig. 5d). The ability to predict bone metastases was independent of
   estrogen receptor status, lymph node involvement, tumour size and histological grade (adjusted
30 hazard ratio HR:0.63 (95% CI:0.42-0.93) P= 0.021). Overall, these results support the mouse
   data that the Irf7 pathway is important for the suppression of bone metastases in human breast
   cancer.
   Treatment with IFN-ai suppresses metastasis

                                                  - 62
            Since Irf7 metastasis suppression was reliant on type I IFN, it was sought to determine
   whether IFN administration would reverse metastatic burden in bone. IFN-ai treatment
   increased expression of Irf7, as well as Irf9 and STATI in 4T1.2 cells in vitro (Fig. 6a),
   consistent with the data demonstrating that Irf7 increased Irf9 and STAT 1 expression via IFN.
 5 As expected from our data above, IFNai treatment did not affect 4T 1.2 cell proliferation in
   vitro (Fig. 6b) or primary tumour growth in vivo (Fig. 6c). In stark contrast, IFN treatment
   significantly reduced metastasis to the spine and femur to undetectable levels (P < 0.007) (Fig.
   6d, e). The extent of metastasis to lung was not reduced (Figure 17) decreased MDSC
   accumulation and G-CSF levels were observed in the peripheral blood in IFN-treated mice
10 (Figure 18 For metastasis-free survival studies, 4T1.2-bearing mice were treated with either
   saline or IFN-ai for five weeks, with primary tumour resection at 3 weeks. Again, IFN-ai had
   no effect on the growth of primary tumours, but resulted in a significant extension of
   metastasis-free survival (Fig. 6f). At end point, all mice in this analysis succumbed to bone and
   lung metastases. These data demonstrate that therapeutic administration of IFN-al can reduce
15 metastatic burden and is a viable therapeutic strategy worthy of further investigation.
           In order to provide insights into the mechanism of IFN inhibition of bone metastases
   specifically, the effect of IFN treatment on immune cell populations in tumour bearing animals
   was measured. The percentage of CD1 1b'Ly6G' MDSC was far greater in the bone marrow
   compared to lung and mammary gland (Figure 19 Importantly, IFN treatment significantly
20 decreased MDSC in the bone marrow and peripheral blood (Figure 18, 19a) but not in the
   mammary gland/primary tumour or in the lungs (Figure 19). Additionally, NK cells were
   significantly increased in the bone marrow following IFN treatment, an effect that was not
   observed at the primary site or in lungs of tumour-bearing animals (Figure 19a). These data
   show that IFN reduces immune suppressor cells and increases effectors specifically in the bone
25 marrow. In addition, NK cells from the mammary gland and lungs were predominantly
   CD1 bhigh /CD27"      (Figure 19b), indicative of terminally differentiated cells that have a
   higher threshold for stimulation (Hayakawa and Smyth, JImmunol 176:1517-1524 (2006)). In
   contrast, the majority of NK cells from the bone marrow were CD1            /CD27 high (Figure
   10b), representing NK cells with greater effector function that are reportedly more sensitive to
30 stimulation by cytokines such as IFN.
            Together these data imply that the mechanism whereby IFN specifically inhibits bone
   metastases of mammary cancers is by selective modulation of MDSC and NK effectors in bone
   marrow.

                                                   - 63
            These studies revealed that one such type I IFN (IFNal) could suppress metastasis to
   bone. To determine whether metastasis suppression could be even more potent with an agonist
   of the pathway that stimulates expression of multiple type I IFNs, 4T1.2 bearing mice were
   treated with the TLR3 agonist poly I:C that mimics a double-stranded viral infection.
 5 Treatment of mice bearing 4T1.2 tumours with poly I:C did not alter primary tumour growth,
   as confirmed by bioluminescence imaging (Figure 20a). However, after primary tumour
   resection, it became clear by bioluminescence that poly I:C treatment suppressed metastasis to
   multiple organs (Figure 20b). This was confirmed and quantitated by PCR detection of
   tumour cell markers in distant organs, where we observed a significant decrease in metastatic
10 burden in lung and bone in the treatment group (Figure 20c).
            The dose of poly I:C was reduced by mimicking an early treatment setting and
   initiating treatment after primary tumour removal for only 2 weeks, before the detection of
   large metastases. Also evaluated was the value of combining poly I:C treatment with a
   commonly used chemotherapeutic, doxorubicin. Although the single agents did not
15 significantly impact metastasis alone in this short-treatment setting, the combination was very
   effective, with an obvious reduction in metastasis at end point (Figure 21). This work
   indicates that combining IFN agonists with chemotherapeutics has potent anti-metastatic
   effects, even at reduced doses.
