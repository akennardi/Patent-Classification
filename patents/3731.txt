FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0003]          The present disclosure relates generally to orthopaedic instruments for use
in the performance of an orthopaedic joint replacement procedure, and more particularly to
orthopaedic surgical instruments for use in the performance of a revision knee replacement
procedure.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0004]          Joint arthroplasty is a well-known surgical procedure by which a diseased
and/or damaged natural joint is replaced by a prosthetic joint. For example, in a total knee
arthroplasty surgical procedure, a patient's natural knee joint is partially or totally replaced
by a prosthetic knee joint or knee prosthesis. A typical knee prosthesis includes a tibial
tray, a femoral component, and a polymer insert or bearing positioned between the tibial
tray and the femoral component. The tibial tray generally includes a plate having a stem
extending distally therefrom, and the femoral component generally includes a pair of
spaced apart condylar elements, which include surfaces that articulate with corresponding
surfaces of the polymer bearing. The stem of the tibial tray is configured to be implanted in
a surgically-prepared medullary canal of the patient's tibia, and the femoral component is
configured to be coupled to a surgically-prepared distal end of a patient's femur

                                                 2
[0005]           From time-to-time, a revision knee surgery may need to be performed on a
patient. In such a revision knee surgery, the previously-implanted knee prosthesis is
surgically removed and a replacement knee prosthesis is implanted. In some revision knee
surgeries, all of the components of the previously-implanted knee prosthesis, including, for
example, the tibial tray, the femoral component, and the polymer bearing, may be
surgically removed. In other revision knee surgeries, only part of the previously-implanted
knee prosthesis may be removed and replaced.
[0006]           During a revision knee surgery, the orthopaedic surgeon typically uses a
variety of different orthopaedic surgical instruments such as, for example, cutting blocks,
surgical reamers, drill guides, prosthetic trials, and other surgical instruments to prepare
the patient's bones to receive the knee prosthesis.

                                                 15
[0080]           The system 10 includes an attachment device 12, a cutting block 14
configured to be secured to the attachment device 12, and a number of intramedullary
orthopaedic surgical instruments 16 configured to be separately secured to the attachment
device 12. What is meant herein by the term "intramedullary orthopaedic surgical
instrument" is a surgical tool configured to be positioned in the medullary canal of the
patient's tibia during the orthopaedic surgical procedure. Examples of intramedullary
orthopaedic surgical instruments include stem trials, broaches, surgical reamers, and the
like. As shown in FIG. 1, the intramedullary surgical instruments 16 include a surgical
reamer 18, a stem trial 20, and a broach assembly 22. As described in greater detail below,
the surgeon may use attachment device 12 and the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical
instruments 16 position the cutting block 14 for use during the resection of the proximal
end of a patient's tibia.
[0081]           The attachment device 12 of the system 10 includes an attachment base 30
configured to be secured to an intramedullary orthopaedic instrument 16 and a mounting
frame 32 configured to be moveably coupled to the base 30. The mounting frame 32 is also
configured to be secured to the cutting block 14, as described in greater detail below. In the
illustrative embodiment, the attachment base 30 and the mounting frame 32 are formed
from a metallic material, such as, for example, stainless steel or cobalt chromium. It should
be appreciated that in other embodiments the attachment base 30 or the mounting frame 32
may be formed from a polymeric material.
[0082]           Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the attachment base 30 includes a housing
34 and a pair of rails 36, 38 that extend outwardly from the housing 34. The housing 34 has
a longitudinal axis 40 extending from a lower end 42 to an upper end 44. The rails 36, 38
extend parallel to each other, and each rail has an end 46 secured to the housing 34 and a
tip 48. Each of the rails 36, 38 also has a longitudinal axis 50 that extends from the end 46
to the tip 48. In the illustrative embodiment, the longitudinal axes 50 of the rails 36, 38
extend orthogonal to the longitudinal axis 40 of the housing 34. As shown in FIG. 2, each
of the rails 36, 38 is circular in cross-section, but it should be appreciated that in other
embodiments each rail may have a square, rectangular, or other cross-sectional shape. It
should also be appreciated that in other embodiments the attachment base 30 may include

                                               16
only a single rail. In other embodiments, the rails may not extend orthogonal relative to the
longitudinal axis 40 of the housing 34.
[0083]           The housing 34 of the attachment base 30 has a channel 52 defined in the
lower end 42 thereof. The channel 52 is defined by a pair of side walls 54 and a
substantially planar surface 56 extending between the side walls 54. As shown in FIG. 3,
the planar surface 56 has an opening 58 defined therein, and an inner wall 60 extends
upwardly from the opening 58 to an opening 62 defined in the upper end 44 of the housing
34. In that way, the inner wall 60 defines a passageway 64 through the housing 34 that
extends along the longitudinal axis 40. As described in greater detail below, the
passageway 64 is sized to receive a shaft of an intramedullary orthopaedic surgical
instrument 16.
[0084]           The attachment base 30 also includes a locking mechanism 70 configured to
secure the attachment device 12 to the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 16.
In the illustrative embodiment, the locking mechanism 70 includes a pair of levers 72
pivotally coupled to the housing 34. As shown in FIG. 3, each lever 72 includes an arm 74
coupled to the housing 34 via a joint 76. The lever 72 also includes a catch 78 extending
from one end 80 of the arm 74 and a handle 82 formed on the opposite end 84.
[0085]           The joint 76 includes a pin 86 that extends through the arm 74 and is
received in apertures 90 (see FIG. 2) defined in the housing 34. Each lever 72 is configured
to pivot about an axis 92 defined by the pin 86 between an engaged position (shown in
solid line in FIG. 3) and a disengaged position (shown in broken line in FIG. 3). In the
engaged position, the catch 78 extends through an opening 94 defined in the housing 34
into the passageway 64. As such, the catch 78 engages an instrument 16 when the
instrument is positioned in the passageway 64. In the disengaged position, the catch 78 is
removed from the passageway 64 such that the catch 78 is disengaged from the instrument
16.
[0086]           The locking mechanism 70 of the attachment device 12 also includes
biasing elements 100 configured to bias each lever 72 into the engaged position. In the
illustrative embodiment, each biasing element is a spring 100 having an end 102 positioned

                                                17
in an aperture 104 defined in the end 84 of the arm 74. The opposite end 106 of each spring
100 is positioned in an aperture 108 defined in the housing 34.
[0087]          As described above, the attachment device 12 of the system 10 also includes
a mounting frame 32 configured to be movably coupled to the attachment base 30.
Referring now to FIGS. 4 and 5, the mounting frame 32 includes a body 110 having a rear
surface 112 that confronts the housing 34 and a front surface 114 positioned opposite the
rear surface 112. The front surface 114 has an opening 116 defined therein, and a
cylindrical inner wall 118 extends inwardly from the opening 116 to define a passageway
120 extending through the body 110. The passageway 120 is sized to receive the rail 36 of
the attachment base 30.
[0088]          The front surface 114 of the body 110 has another opening 122 defined
therein. A cylindrical inner wall 124 extends inwardly from the opening 122 to define
another passageway 126 through the body 110. As shown in FIG. 4, the passageway 126
extends parallel to the passageway 120, and the passageway 126 is sized to receive the
other rail 38 of the attachment base 30. When the mounting frame 32 is coupled to the
attachment base 30, the rails 36, 38 are positioned in the passageways 120, 126, and the
mounting frame 32 is configured to slide along the rails 36, 38 relative to the housing 34 of
the attachment base 30.
[0089]          The mounting frame 32 of the attachment device 12 also includes a
retention mechanism 130 configured to inhibit movement of the mounting frame 32
relative to the housing 34. In the illustrative embodiment, the retention mechanism 130
includes a cantilevered arm 132 secured at one end 134 to the body 110 of the mounting
frame 32. As shown in FIG. 4, the cantilevered arm 132 includes a free end 136 configured
to engage rail 36 when the mounting frame 32 is coupled to the attachment base 30. The
retention mechanism 130 also includes a cantilevered arm 140 that has a free end 142
configured to engage the other rail 38 when the mounting frame 32 is coupled to the
attachment base 30. The free ends 136, 142 of the arms 132, 140 exert a bias on the rails
36, 38 that inhibits movement of the mounting frame 32.

                                               18
[0090]          In use, when a surgeon or other user applies sufficient force in a direction,
for example, toward the attachment base 30, the bias exerted by the cantilevered arms 132,
140 is overcome such that the mounting frame 32 may be advanced along the rails 36, 38
toward the attachment base 30. When the surgeon no longer applies the force, the bias
exerted by the arms 132, 140 prevents further movement of the mounting frame 32.
[0091]          In other embodiments, the retention mechanism may include a clamp
configured to be selectively engaged with the rails. In still other embodiments, the
retention mechanism may include a fastener, latch, or other mechanism to prevent relative
movement between the mounting frame 32 and the attachment base 30. Additionally, in the
illustrative embodiment, the mounting frame 32 is detachable from the attachment base 30.
It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the attachment device 12 may be
configured such the mounting frame 32 is non-removable from the attachment base 30.
[0092]          As described above, the mounting frame 32 of the attachment device 12 is
configured to be secured to the cutting block 14. As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the mounting
frame 32 includes a locking mechanism 144 configured to selectively engage the cutting
block 14. In the illustrative embodiment, the locking mechanism 144 includes a central
shaft 146 pivotally coupled to the body 110 of the mounting frame 32. The central shaft
146 has a lower end 148 that extends downwardly from the body 110. A plug 150 is
formed on the lower end 148 of the central shaft 146, and the plug 150 includes a pair of
flanges 152 that extend outwardly from the central shaft 146. As described in greater detail
below, the flanges 152 are configured to be received in a channel 154 defined in the cutting
block 14 to selectively secure the cutting block 14 to the mounting frame 32.
[0093]          As shown in FIG. 4, the central shaft 146 of the locking mechanism 144 has
a longitudinal axis 156. The locking mechanism 144 also includes a control knob 158
operable to rotate the central shaft 146 (and hence plug 150) about the axis 156. In the
illustrative embodiment, the control knob 158 includes an arm 160 secured to the central
shaft 146. The arm 160 extends outwardly from the central shaft 146 through a slot 162
defined in the front surface 114 of the body 110. The arm 160 includes a grip 164 that is
spaced apart from the body 110, and the grip 164 may be grasped by the user to operate the
control knob 158.

                                                19
[0094]          The control knob 158 is operable to rotate the plug 150 in the direction
indicated by arrow 166 between an engaged position (see FIG. 4) and a disengaged
position (see FIG. 5). In the engaged position, the flanges 152 are received in the channel
154 defined in the cutting block 14, thereby securing the cutting block 14 to the mounting
frame 32. In the disengaged position, the flanges 152 are removed from the channel 154,
thereby releasing the block 14. As shown in FIG. 5, the arm 160 of the control knob 158 is
positioned between a pair of lips 168 formed on the body 110 when the plug 150 is in the
disengaged position.
[0095]          In other embodiments, the control knob may have a handle or grip secured
to the upper end of the central shaft 146. In still other embodiments, the locking
mechanism 144 may include a lever pivotally coupled the mounting frame that is
selectively engaged with and disengaged with the cutting block. In other embodiments, the
locking mechanism 144 may include any combination of latches or other fasteners to
secure the cutting block 14 to the attachment device 12.
[0096]          As shown in FIGS 4 and 5, the mounting frame 32 also includes a pair of
alignment pins 170 extending downwardly from the body 110. Each alignment pin 170 is
sized and shaped to be received in an aperture 172 defined in the cutting block 14. In the
illustrative embodiment, each pin 170 has a circular cross section. It should be appreciated
that in other embodiments each pin may have a square, rectangular, or other cross-sectional
shape.
[0097]          Referring now to FIG. 6, the system 10 includes a cutting block 14. The
cutting block 14 includes a posterior side wall 200 that is configured to confront the
anterior side of the patient's tibia, as described in greater detail below. The cutting block
14 also includes an anterior side wall 202 that is positioned opposite the posterior side wall
200. An upper surface 204 connects the side walls 200, 202. In the illustrative
embodiment, the cutting block 14 is formed from a metallic material, such as, for example,
stainless steel or cobalt chromium.
[0098]          An opening 206 is defined in the upper surface 204, and an inner wall 208
extends downwardly from the opening 206 to define a slot 210 in the cutting block 14. As

                                                20
shown in FIG. 6, the slot 210 has an open end 212 defined in the anterior side wall 202,
and a closed end 214 positioned between the side walls 200, 202. The inner wall 208 has a
channel 154 defined therein. As described above, the channel 154 is sized to receive the
flanges 152 of the locking mechanism 144 to secure the cutting block 14 to the attachment
device 12.
[0099]           The cutting block 14 also includes a pair of apertures 172 positioned on
each side of the slot 210. As described above, the apertures 172 are sized to receive the
alignment pins 170 of the mounting frame 32.
[0100]           The cutting block 14 includes a number of cutting guides 220 that may be
used during an orthopaedic surgical procedure to resect a portion of the patient's bone.
Each cutting guide 220 includes an elongated slot sized to receive a cutting saw blade of a
surgical saw or other surgical device. In the illustrative embodiment, the cutting block 14
has four cutting guides 220 extending through the side walls 200, 202. Each cutting guide
220 includes a planar surface 222 that defines a resection plane 224.
[0101]           The resection planes 224 extend through the patient's tibia when the cutting
block 14 is secured to the attachment device 12 on the tibia. In that way, the cutting guides
220 may be used by the orthopaedic surgeon during the resection of the patient's tibia. In
the illustrative embodiment, the cutting guides 220 (hence the resection planes 224) are
spaced part from each other by about five millimeters. As such, the surgeon may select the
particular cutting guide 220 corresponding to the amount of bone to be removed. In other
embodiments, the cutting block 14 may include any number of cutting guides 220, which
may be spaced apart by an amount greater than or less than five millimeters.
[0102]           As shown in FIG. 6, the cutting block 14 includes a plurality of fastener
guides 226. Each guide 226 includes a bore 228 sized to receive fasteners such as, for
example, fixation pins 230 (see FIG. 24), which may be utilized to secure the cutting block
14 to the patient's tibia. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the cutting
block 14 may include additional fastener guides 226 or other fastening elements to secure
the cutting block to the patient's tibia. The angle of each fastener guide 226 may also vary
to provide additional security with the bone.

                                               21

248 to engage the internal threads with the external threads 274 and thereby secure the
stem trial 20 to the surgical reamer 18. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments
the stem trial 20 may be engaged with surgical reamer 18 without being secured thereto.
[0108]          As described above, the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instruments 16
of the system 10 include a broach assembly 22 configured to be positioned in the
medullary canal 254 of the patient's tibia. Referring now to FIGS. 8 and 9, the broach
assembly 22 includes a broach 280 and a broach insert 282 configured to be removably
coupled to the broach 280. The broach 280 includes an outer surface 284 extending from a
tip 286 to an upper end 288. The outer surface 284 is tapered, with the diameter of the
broach 280 decreasing from the upper end 288 to the tip 286.
[0109]          A plurality of cutting teeth 290 are formed on the outer surface 284 between
the tip 286 and the upper end 288. As described in greater detail below, the cutting teeth
290 are configured to engage the bone surrounding the medullary canal 254 when the
broach 280 is inserted therein. It should be appreciated that other broaches having different
configurations may be provided. For example, the outer diameter and/or length of the
broach may vary to produce different sized canals to accommodate prosthetic components
of different sizes.

                                              23
[0110]          As shown in FIG. 8, the tip 286 of the broach 280 has an aperture 302
defined therein. An inner wall 304 defines the aperture 302, and the inner wall 304 has a
plurality of internal threads (not shown) formed thereon. The aperture 302 is sized to
receive the upper end 272 of the stem trial 20 such that the internal threads engage with the
external threads 274 and thereby secure the stem trial 20 to the broach 280.
[0111]          The broach 280 includes a substantially planar top surface 306 at the upper
end 288 thereof. An opening 308 is defined in the top surface 306, and the broach 280 has
inner walls 310, 312 that extend downwardly from the top surface 306. The inner walls
310, 312 cooperate with a bottom wall 314 to define a slot 316 in the broach 280. As
shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, the slot 316 extends through the outer surface 284 of the broach
280.
[0112]          The inner wall 310 of the broach 280 has a planar surface 318 that extends
inwardly from the outer surface 284. The other inner wall 312 has a pair of planar surfaces
320, 322 that extend inwardly from the outer surface 284. As shown in FIG. 9, the planar

The plate opening 450 has a central opening 454 and a pair of elongated openings 456
extending outwardly therefrom. An inner wall 458 extends downwardly from the opening
450 to define a passageway 460 and a passageway 462 through the plate 442. As will be
described in greater detail below, the configuration of the passageways 460, 462 permits
the advancement of a keel punch and various other instruments into the proximal end of
the patient's tibia. It should be appreciated that the tibial base trial 436 may be formed in a
number of different sizes to accommodate tibias of various sizes.
[0124]          The inner wall 458 includes an upper wall 464 and a lower wall 466 offset
or otherwise spaced inwardly from the upper wall 464. The upper wall 464 and the lower

shown in FIG. 12, a pair of oblong-shaped apertures 496 are defined in the side wall 448,
one on each side of the notch 480. The notch 480 and the apertures 496 are configured to
receive a lever and a pair of pins, respectively, associated with an alignment handle.
[0126]          As shown in FIG. 13, a pin 486 extends downwardly from the lower surface
446 of the plate 442. As described in greater detail below, the pin 486 is sized to be
received in the slot 356 defined in the broach 280. The plate 442 also includes a number of

                                                27
fastener guides 498 that are defined in the anterior aspect 482 thereof. Each fastener guide
498 includes a bore 500 configured to receive a fastener such as a fixation pin, which may
be utilized to secure the base trial 436 to the proximal end of the patient's tibia.
[0127]           As shown in FIG. 12, the tibial base trial assembly 432 includes a locking
mechanism 510 configured to secure the tibial base trial 436 to one of the intramedullary
orthopaedic surgical instruments 440. In the illustrative embodiment, the locking
mechanism 510 includes a fastener 512 pivotally coupled to the tibial base trial 436. The
fastener 512 is permanently secured to the plate 442 of the tibial base trial 436, but it
should be appreciated that in other embodiments the fastener may be removable from the
tibial base trial or secured to the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instruments.
[0128]           The fastener 512 of the locking mechanism 510 includes a button head 514
positioned above the top surface 472 of the platform 470 and a central shaft 516 secured to
the button head 514. The central shaft 516 extends through an opening (not shown) defined
in the platform 470 to a lower end 518. An outer sleeve 520 is secured to the central shaft
516 between the lower end 518 and the lower surface 446 of the plate 442, thereby
securing the fastener 512 to the base trial 436. As shown in FIG. 12, the fastener 512
includes a plurality of external threads 522 that are formed on the lower end 518 of the
central shaft 516. The external threads 522 of the fastener 512 engage internal threads
formed on an intramedullary surgical instrument 440 to secure the intramedullary surgical
instrument 440 to the base trial 436.
[0129]           For example, as shown FIG. 11, the intramedullary surgical instruments 440
include the broach 280, which is configured to be coupled to the base trial 436 via the
fastener 512. As described above, the broach 280 has a bore 338 defined therein and an
aperture 344 positioned below the bore 338. The aperture 344 is defined by a cylindrical
wall 342 that has a plurality of internal threads 346 formed thereon. To secure the broach
280 to the base trial 436, the base trial 436 is aligned with the broach 280 and the lower
end 518 of the fastener 512 is advanced into the bore 338. The external threads 522 formed
on the fastener 512 are advanced into contact with the internal threads 346 of the broach
280. By rotating the fastener 512 about the longitudinal axis 530, the internal threads 346
are engaged with external threads 522, thereby securing the broach 280 to the base trial

                                               28
436. When the base trial 436 is seated on the top surface 306 of the broach 280, the outer
sleeve 520 of the fastener 512 is positioned in the bore 338 of the broach 280.
[0130]           When the broach 280 is secured to the base trial 436, the base trial 436 is
permitted to rotate relative to the broach 280. As described above, the pin 486 is received
in the slot 356 when the broach 280 is secured to the base trial 436. The slot 356 is sized
such that the pin 486 may move within the slot 356, thereby permitting the base trial 436 to
rotate relative to the broach 280 during the orthopaedic surgical procedure.
[0131]           The button head 514 of the fastener 512 includes a neck 524 that confronts
the platform 470 of the base trial 436 and a knob 526 secured to the neck 524. The knob
526 has a knurled outer surface 528 that may be grasped by the surgeon to rotate the
fastener 512 about the longitudinal axis 530. The button head 514 also has a socket 532
defined therein, which is sized to receive a driver or other surgical tool to rotate the
fastener 512 about the axis 530.
[0132]           Referring now to FIGS. 14 and 15, the system 10 further includes a pair of
base inserts 438. The base inserts 438 are configured to be positioned separately in the
plate opening 450 of the base trial 436. Each base insert 438 has a lower surface 540
configured to engage the shelf surface 468 of the base trial 436 when the base insert 438 is
seated on the base trial 436 and an upper surface 542 positioned opposite the lower surface
540. The base insert 438 includes a central frame 546 sized to be received in the central
opening 454 of the base trial 436. The central frame 546 has a cylindrical slot 548 defined
therein, which is sized to receive the platform 470 of the base trial 436. A lug 544 extends
upwardly from the upper surface 542 adjacent to the slot 548.
[0133]           The base insert 438 also includes a pair of prongs 550, 552 that extend
outwardly from the central frame 546 to ends 554, 556, respectively. The prongs 550, 552
are sized to be received in the elongated openings 456 of the base trial 436. The prong 550
has a bore 558 defined therein at the end 554 thereof. Similarly, the prong 552 has a bore
560 defined therein at the end 556 thereof. The bores 558, 560 are sized to receive pegs
562, 564 of the attachment tool 566, as described in greater detail below.

                                              29
[0134]          The base inserts 438 include a check insert 570 (see FIG. 14) and a keel
punch insert 572 (see FIG. 15). The keel punch insert 572 includes a pair of lower arms
574, 476 that extend downwardly from the prongs 550, 552, respectively. Each of the
lower arm 574, 576 includes a tapered outer surface 578 that has a plurality of cutting teeth
580 formed thereon.
[0135]          Returning to FIG. 11, the system 10 includes the attachment tool 566, which
may be used by the surgeon to attach and detach the base inserts 438 from the base trial
436. In the illustrative embodiment, the attachment tool 566 includes a main body 590 and
a pair of arms 592, 594 extending outwardly from the main body 590. The main body 590
corresponds to the central frame 546 of the base insert 438, and the arms 592, 594
correspond to the prongs 550, 552, respectively, of the base insert 438. The attachment tool
566 has a lower surface 596 that engages the upper surface 542 of the base insert 438 when
the base insert 438 is secured thereto.
[0136]          As shown in FIGS. 16 and 17, the arm 592 of the tool 566 has a peg 598
extending downwardly from the lower surface 596. The peg 598 is cylindrical and is sized
to be received in the bore 558 defined in the end 554 of the prong 550. The peg 598 has an
annular slot 600 defined therein, and a biasing element 602 is positioned in the slot 600.
The biasing element 602 is configured to engage the prong 550 when the peg 598 is
positioned in the bore 558 to secure the base insert 438 to the attachment tool 566. In the
illustrative embodiment, the biasing element 602 is a ring-shaped coil. It should be
appreciated that in other embodiments the spring may take the form of another biasing or
friction element, such as, for example, an o-ring or a retaining ring.
[0137]          The other arm 594 of the tool 566 also has a peg 604 extending downwardly
from the lower surface 596. The peg 604 is cylindrical and is sized to be received in the
bore 560 defined in the end 556 of the prong 552. The peg 604 has an annular slot 606
defined therein, and a biasing element 602 is positioned in the slot 600. The biasing
element 602 is configured to engage the prong 552 when the peg 604 is positioned in the
bore 560 to secure the base insert 438 to the attachment tool 566.

                                               30
[0138]          The attachment tool 566 has an upper surface 610 positioned opposite the
lower surface 596. The main body 590 has a slot 612 that extends through the upper
surface 610 and inwardly from the outer surface 614. As shown in FIG. 16, the main body
590 also includes a flange 616 that extends into the slot 612. The main body 590 also
includes a central bore 618 that is defined in the upper surface 610.
[0139]          As shown in FIG. 17, the lower surface 596 of the attachment tool 566 has
an opening 620 defined therein. An inner wall 622 extends inwardly from the opening 620
to define an aperture 624 in the main body 590 of the tool 566. The aperture 624 is sized to
receive the button head 514 of the fastener 512 when the tool 566 is secured to the base
insert 438 on the base trial 436.
[0140]          Returning to FIG. 11, the system 10 includes a number of intramedullary
orthopaedic surgical instruments 440 that are configured to be coupled to the base trial
436. The instruments 440 include the broach 280, the stem trial 20, and a modular stem
630. It should be appreciated that other modular stems having different configurations may
be provided. For example, as shown in FIG. 18, the outer diameter and/or length of the
modular stem may vary to produce different sized canals to accommodate prosthetic
components of different sizes.
[0141]          The modular stem 630 includes an outer surface 632 extending from a tip
634 to an upper end 636. The outer surface 632 is tapered, with the diameter of the
modular stem 630 decreasing from the upper end 636 to the tip 634. As shown in FIG. 18,
the tip 634 of the modular stem 630 has an aperture 638 defined therein. An inner wall 640
defines the aperture 638, and the inner wall 640 has a plurality of internal threads (not
shown) formed thereon. As described above, the stem trial 20 includes a plurality of
external threads 274, and the aperture 638 is sized to receive the upper end 272 of the stem
trial 20 such that the internal threads engage with the external threads 274 to thereby
secure the stem trial 20 to the modular stem 630.
[0142]          The modular stem 630 includes a substantially planar top surface 642 at the
upper end 636 thereof. An opening 644 is defined in the top surface 642, and the modular
stem 630 has inner walls 646, 648 that extend downwardly from the top surface 642. The

                                               31
inner walls 646, 648 cooperate with a bottom wall 650 to define a slot 652 in the modular
stem 630. As shown in FIGS. 18 and 19, the slot 652 extends through the outer surface 632
of the modular stem 630.
[0143]          A platform 654 extending upwardly from the bottom wall 650 is positioned
in the slot 652. The platform 654 has a top surface 656 and an opening 658 defined in the
top surface 656. A cylindrical wall 660 extends inwardly from the opening 658 to a lower
surface 664. The lower surface 664 and the cylindrical wall 660 cooperate to define a bore
668 in the platform 654. As shown in FIG. 19, the lower surface 664 has another opening
670 defined therein, and another cylindrical wall 672 extends inwardly from the opening
670. The cylindrical wall 672 defines an aperture 674 within the modular stem 630 and has
a plurality of internal threads 676 formed thereon.
[0144]          To secure the modular stem 630 to the base trial 436, the base trial 436 is
aligned with the modular stem 630 and the lower end 518 of the fastener 512 is advanced
into the bore 668. The external threads 522 formed on the fastener 512 are advanced into
contact with the internal threads 676 of the modular stem 630. By rotating the fastener 512
about the longitudinal axis 530, the internal threads 676 are engaged with external threads
522, thereby securing the modular stem 630 to the base trial 436. When the base trial 436
is seated on the top surface 656 of the modular stem 630, the outer sleeve 520 of the
fastener 512 is positioned in the bore 668 of the modular stem 630.
[0145]          As described above, the system 10 also includes a number of tibial bearing
trial assemblies 434. An tibial bearing trial assembly 434 is disclosed in U.S. Patent App.
Serial No. 61/503,300, filed June 30, 2011 and entitled "TRIALING SYSTEM FOR A
KNEE PROSTHESIS AND METHOD OF USE," by Thomas E. Wogoman et al.
(Attorney Docket No. 265280-210420, DEP6286USPSP), which is incorporated herein by
reference. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the tibial bearing trial may be
a monolithic component, and the system 10 may include multiple tibial bearing trials
different sizes and configurations.
[0146]          Referring now to FIG. 20, each tibial bearing trial assembly 434 is a multi
piece assembly configured to assist the surgeon in selecting a size and configuration of a

                                                  32
prosthetic tibial bearing component of the knee prosthesis. A tibial bearing trial 434 may
be assembled with one of a number of tibial bearing surface trials 680 and one of a number
of a plurality of trial shims 682. Each bearing surface trial 680 has a different size and/or
configuration, and each shim 682 has a different thickness. Because each shim 682 is
configured to be secured to each bearing surface trial 680, the surgeon is able to assemble a
tibial bearing trial 434 of one size and configuration, evaluate the performance of that tibial
bearing trial 434, and then modify the tibial bearing trial 434 as necessary to determine
intraoperatively the type and configuration of the prosthetic tibial bearing component to be
implanted.
[0147]           As shown in FIG. 20, one of the bearing surface trials 680 is a fixed bearing
surface trial 684. The term "fixed bearing surface trial" as used herein refers to a bearing
surface trial that is fixed in position relative to the tibial base trial 436 when the bearing
surface trial and shim are attached thereto (i.e., it is configured to not substantially rotate or
move in the anterior-posterior direction or medial-lateral direction relative to the tibial base
trial 436). The fixed bearing surface trial 684 may be embodied as a cruciate retaining trial,
a posterior stabilized trial, a revision trial, or other surface trial configuration, per the
surgeon's preference. For example, in embodiments where the fixed bearing surface trial
684 is embodied as a posterior stabilized trial, the fixed bearing surface trial 684 may
include a spine extending upwardly from the upper bearing surface of the trial 684.
[0148]           The fixed bearing surface trial 684 has a platform 686 including a lower
surface 688 that contacts the shim 682 when the shim 682 is secured thereto. The platform
686 also includes a pair of articulation surfaces 690 that are positioned opposite the lower
surface 688. The articulation surfaces 690 are configured to rotate with the condyle
surfaces of a femoral surgical instrument of a femoral prosthetic component.
[0149]           The other bearing surface trial 680 is embodied as a mobile bearing surface
trial 700. The term "mobile bearing surface trial" as used herein refers to a bearing surface
trial that is permitted to rotate relative to the tibial base trial 436 when the bearing surface
trial and the shim are attached thereto (i.e., it is configured to substantially rotate or move
in the anterior-posterior direction or the medial-lateral direction relative to the tibial base
trial 436). The mobile bearing surface trial 700 may be embodied as a cruciate retaining

                                                   33
trial, a posterior stabilized trial, a revision trial, or other surface trial configuration, per the
surgeon's preference. For example, in embodiments where the mobile bearing surface trial
700 is embodied as a posterior stabilized trial, the mobile bearing surface trial 700 may
include a spine extending upwardly from the upper bearing surface thereof.
[0150]           The mobile bearing surface trial 700 has a platform 702 including a lower
surface 704 the shim 682 when the shim 682 is secured thereto. The platform 702 also
includes a pair of articulation surfaces 706 that are positioned opposite the lower surface
704. The articulation surfaces 706 are configured to rotate with the condyle surfaces of a
femoral surgical instrument or femoral prosthetic component.
[0151]           As described above, the surface trials 684, 700 are configured to be secured
with a trial shim 682. The shim 682 has an aperture 708 defined therein, which is
configured to receive the button head 514 of the fastener 512 secured to the base trial 436
and the lug 544 of the base insert 438 when the shim 682 is positioned on the base trial
436. Each shim 682 also includes a pair of through-holes 710, which are configured to
receive fastener pegs (not shown) of the tibial bearing surface trials 680 to secure the shim
682 to each trial 680.
[0152]           The aperture 708 also includes a central passageway 712, a rectangular slot
714 extending outwardly from the central passageway 712, and an arcuate slot 716. The
central passageway 712 is sized to receive the button head 514. As will be described in
greater detail below, the rectangular slot 714 is sized to receive the lug 544 when the shim
682 is attached to a fixed bearing surface trial 684 on the base trial 436. The arcuate slot
716 is also sized to receive the lug 544 when the shim 682 is attached to a mobile bearing
surface trial 700, thereby permitting the mobile bearing surface trial 700 to rotate relative
to the base trial 436.
[0153]           The system 10 may be utilized during the performance of an orthopaedic
surgical procedure similar to that shown in FIGS. 21A and 21B. As shown in FIGS. 22-24
and 30-32, the surgeon may initially prepare the medullary canal and determine whether
the patient requires a tibial sleeve. The surgeon may then insert an intramedullary
orthopaedic surgical instrument 16, such as, for example, the surgical reamer 18 or the

                                                34
broach assembly 22 into the medullary canal. The surgeon may secure the attachment
device 12 and the cutting block 14 to the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 16
and perform a resection of the patient's tibia.
[0154]           As shown in FIGS. 25-29, the surgeon may assemble a tibial tray trial 432
and perform a trial reduction with a tibial bearing trial 434. The surgeon may then impact a
keel punch insert 572 into the patient's tibia before removing the tibial tray trial 432
therefrom.
[0155]           Referring now to FIGS. 21A and 21B, an illustrative orthopaedic surgical
procedure 800 utilizing the system 10 is shown. In procedure block 802, a medullary canal
254 of a patient's tibia 720 is initially prepared. To do so, an orthopaedic surgeon may
insert an initial surgical reamer 722 into the medullary canal 254. As shown in FIG. 22, the
surgeon may use the reamer 722 to drill and/or ream the medullary canal 254 to the depth
and/or diameter required receive the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 16.
Multiple drills or reamers may be used to increase the size of the opening 724 of the
medullary canal 254 formed on the proximal end 726 of the patient's tibia 720.
[0156]           In procedure block 804 of the surgical procedure 800, the surgeon
determines whether a prosthetic sleeve will be included with the tibial prosthetic
component. The surgeon may make this determination pre-operatively or intraoperatively,
depending on the condition of the patient's tibia 720. If the surgeon determines a prosthetic
sleeve is necessary, the procedure 800 advances to procedure block 806 in FIG. 21B. If a
prosthetic sleeve is unnecessary, the procedure 800 advances to procedure block 808.
[0157]           In procedure block 808, the surgeon selects a surgical reamer 18 and a stem
trial 20. As described above, multiple surgical reamers 18 and/or stem trials 20 may be
provided to accommodate prosthetic components of different sizes. When the surgeon has
selected a reamer 18 and the stem trial 20, the surgeon may assemble the instruments to
form an intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 16. To do so, the surgeon aligns
the upper end 272 of the stem trial 20 with the aperture 248 defined in the tip 244 of the
reamer 18. The surgeon may advance the upper end 272 of the trial 20 into contact with the
inner wall 250 of the reamer 18 to engage the external threads 274 formed on the trial 20

                                               35
with the internal threads of the reamer 18. The surgeon may thread the trial 20 into the
reamer 18 to secure the instruments together.
[0158]          After the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 16 is assembled,
the procedure 800 advances to procedure block 810. In block 810, the surgeon advances
the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 16 into the medullary canal 254, as
shown in FIG. 23. To do so, the surgeon may secure the shank 242 of the reamer 18 to a
power tool and engage the cutting flutes 252 of the reamer 18 with the patient's tibia 720.
The surgeon may then operate the power tool to drill or ream the patient's tibia 720 with
the reamer 18 and insert the reamer 18 and the stem trial 20 to the required depth.
[0159]          When the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 16 is properly
positioned in proximal end 726 of the patient's tibia 720, the surgeon may secure the
attachment device 12 to the shank 242 of the reamer 18 in procedure block 812. To do so,
the surgeon aligns the passageway 64 of the attachment base 30 with the upper end 258 of
the shank 242. The surgeon may then press on the handles 82 of the levers 72 in the
direction indicated by arrows 730 in FIG. 24 to rotate the levers 72 and remove the catches
78 from the passageway 64. The surgeon may advance the attachment base 30 downward
over the shank 242 until the lower end 42 of the base 30 engages the platform 256 of the
reamer 18. The surgeon may release the handles 82, thereby permitting the springs 100 to
rotate the levers 72 into the engaged position. In that position, the catches 78 are received
in the recess 262 formed in the shank 242, thereby securing the attachment device 12 to the
reamer 18.
[0160]          Returning to FIG. 21A, the procedure 800 advances to procedure block 814
in which the cutting block 14 is moved into position for the resection of the proximal end
726 of the patient's tibia 720. To do so, the surgeon may secure the cutting block 14 to the
mounting frame 32, as shown in FIG. 24. In the illustrative embodiment, the surgeon may
grasp the control knob 158 and operate the control knob 158 to move the plug 150 to the
disengaged position. The surgeon may then align the slot 210 of the cutting block 14 with
the plug 150 and the apertures 172 with the alignment pins 170 of the mounting frame 32.
The cutting block 14 may be advanced over the plug 150 and the alignment pins 170, and
the surgeon may operate the control knob 158 to rotate the plug 150 such that the flanges

                                                36
152 of the plug 150 are received in the channel 154 defined in the cutting block 14, thereby
securing the cutting block 14 to the mounting frame 32. The surgeon may position the
mounting frame 32 on the rails 36, 38 of the attachment base 30 and slide the mounting
frame 32 (and hence cutting block 14) into position relative to the tibia 720.
[0161]         After the cutting block 14 is positioned, the surgeon may perform the
resection in procedure block 816. To do so, the surgeon may use the cutting guides 220
defined in the cutting block 14, as shown in FIG. 24. For example, the surgeon may select
the cutting guide 220 of the cutting block 14 corresponding to a desired amount of bone to
be removed. The surgeon may perform the resection by inserting a bone saw blade 732 into
the selected cutting guide 220 of the cutting block 14. The resection removes a proximal
portion of the patient's tibia 720 to create a substantially planar proximal surface 734.
[0162]         The surgeon may also utilize fastener guides 226 to attach one or more
fixation pins 230 to the patient's tibia 720. After securing the cutting block 14 to the tibia
720 with fixation pins 230, the surgeon may remove the attachment device 12, the reamer
18, and the stem trial 20 from the tibia 720 prior to performing the resection.
[0163]         After performing the resection, the surgeon may assemble a tibial tray trial
432 in procedure block 818. To do so, the surgeon may select a base trial 436 and a
modular stem 630 and secure those instruments together with the stem trial 20, as shown in
FIG. 25. To secure the modular stem 630 to the base trial 436, the base trial 436 is aligned
with the modular stem 630 and the lower end 518 of the fastener 512 is advanced into the
bore 668. The external threads 522 formed on the fastener 512 are advanced into contact
with the internal threads 676 of the modular stem 630. By rotating the fastener 512 about
the longitudinal axis 530, the internal threads 676 are engaged with external threads 522,
thereby securing the modular stem 630 to the base trial 436. When the base trial 436 is
seated on the top surface 656 of the modular stem 630, the outer sleeve 520 of the fastener
512 is positioned in the bore 668 of the modular stem 630.
[0164]         To secure the stem trial 20 to the modular stem 630, the surgeon may align
the upper end 272 of the stem trial 20 with the aperture 638 defined in the tip 634 of the
modular stem 630. The surgeon may advance the upper end 272 of the trial 20 into contact

                                                  37
with the inner wall 640 of the modular stem 630 to engage the external threads 274 formed
on the trial 20 with the internal threads of the modular stem 630. The surgeon may thread
the trial 20 into the modular stem 630 to secure the instruments together.
[0165]           In the procedure block 820, the tibial tray trial 432 is inserted into the
medullary canal 254 of the patient's tibia 720. To do so, the surgeon may align the stem
trial 20 and the modular stem 630 with the opening 724 of the canal 254, as shown in FIG.
25. The surgeon may then advance the tibial tray trial 432 downward such that the stem
trial 20 and the modular stem 630 are positioned in the medullary canal 254 and the tibial
base trial 436 is engaged with the surgically-prepared proximal surface 734 of the tibia
720.
[0166]           After the tibial tray trial 432 is positioned, the surgeon may perform a trial
reduction in procedure block 822. To do so, the surgeon may position the check insert 570
in the plate opening 450 defined in the tibial base trial 436 as shown in FIG. 26. Once the
selected check insert 570 is properly seated, the surgeon may select a trial shim 682 and a
tibial bearing surface trial 680.
[0167]           For example, if the surgeon desires a mobile bearing trial, the surgeon may
position the selected trial shim 682 on the tibial tray trial 432. As shown in FIG. 27, the
surgeon aligns the aperture 708 of the shim 682 with the button head 514 of the fastener
512 and the lug 544 of the insert 570. The surgeon then places the shim 682 over the
button head 514 and the lug 544 to seat the shim 682 on the base trial 436. When properly
seated, the lug 544 is received in the slot 716 of the shim 682.
[0168]           The surgeon may select a mobile bearing surface trial 700 and attach the
trial 700 to the shim 682. To do so, the surgeon aligns the through-holes 710 of the shim
682 with the pegs of the bearing surface trial 700. The surgeon then advances the pegs into
the respective through-holes 710 such that the lower surface 704 of the mobile bearing
surface trial 700 is placed in contact with the shim 682 to assemble the mobile bearing
trial.

                                                 38
[0169]          The surgeon may extend the knee and note the anteroposterior stability,
medial-lateral stability, and overall alignment in the A/P and M/L planes. The surgeon may
also able to assess the bearing rotation and patellofemoral tracking because the mobile
bearing surface trial 700 is rotatable relative to the base trial 436. The surgeon may
continue to try various combinations of shims 682 and bearing surface trials 700 to
ascertain which implant size and configuration (e.g., the thickness of the implant, the
mobility of the implant, etc.) will have the best stability in flexion and extension while
permitting the desired kinematics.
[0170]          If the surgeon desires a fixed bearing trial, the surgeon may select a fixed
bearing surface trial 684 and secure the trial 684 to the shim 682. The surgeon may then
position the selected trial shim 682 (and bearing surface trial 684) on the tibial tray trial
432. The surgeon may align the aperture 708 of the shim 682 with the button head 514 of
the fastener 512 and the lug 544 of the insert 570. The surgeon may then place the shim
682 over the button head 514 and the lug 544 to seat the shim 682 on the base trial 436.
When properly seated in the fixed bearing orientation, the lug 544 is received in the slot
714 of the shim 682 such that the shim 682 (and hence bearing surface trial 684) is not
permitted to rotate relative to the base trial 436.
[0171]          When the fixed bearing surface trial 684 is in place, the surgeon carefully
extends the knee of the patient, noting the anteroposterior stability, medial-lateral stability,
and overall alignment in the anterior-posterior ("A/P") plane and medial-lateral ("M/L")
plane. Rotational alignment of the tibial base trial 436 may be adjusted with the knee
moving through the range of motion, rotating the trial 436, shim 682, and the bearing trial
684. The surgeon sets the rotation of the base trial 436 by assessing multiple factors
including femoral position and tibial plateau coverage. The surgeon may continue to try
various combinations of shims 682 and bearing surface trials 684 to ascertain which
implant size and configuration (e.g., the thickness of the implant, the mobility of the
implant, etc.) will have the best stability in flexion and extension while permitting the
desired kinematics. After completing trial reduction, the surgeon may fix the tibial tray
trial 432 into position by inserting one or more fixation pins into the fastener guides 498.

                                                39
[0172]          Returning to FIG. 21A, the procedure 800 may advance to procedure block
824 in which the surgeon continues the tibial preparation by impacting the keel punch
insert 572 into the proximal end 726 of the tibia 720. To do so, the surgeon removes the
check insert 570 from the base trial 436, as shown in FIG. 28. The surgeon may then
secure the punch insert 572 to the attachment tool 566 by aligning the pegs 598, 604 of the
attachment tool 566 with the bores 558, 560, respectively, of the punch insert 572 and
advancing the pegs 598, 604 into the bores 558, 560.
[0173]          The surgeon may secure the attachment tool 566 to an impaction handle 740
by engaging a catch (not shown) of the impaction handle 740 with the flange 616 formed
on the attachment tool 566. After securing the handle 740 to the tool 566 and the punch
insert 572, the surgeon may align the lower arms 574, 576 of the punch insert 572 with the
passageways 460, 462 defined in the base trial 436. The surgeon may then advance the
punch insert 572 downward such that the lower arms 574, 576 pass through the
passageways 460, 462 and into the proximal end 726 of the tibia 720.
[0174]          The surgeon may then drive the punch insert 572 into the tibia 720 by
striking the handle 740 with mallet, sledge, or other impaction tool. As the punch insert
572 is driven into the bone, the cutting teeth 580 of the punch insert 572 engage the
patient's tibia 720 to form additional slots (not shown) in the tibia 720. When the punch
insert 572 is seated on the tibial base trial 436, the lower arms 574, 576 extend outwardly
from the slot 652 defined in the modular stem 630.
[0175]          After the keel punch insert 572 has been driven into the tibia 720, the
procedure 800 may advance to the procedure block 824. In block 824, the surgeon may
remove the tibial tray trial 432 and the punch insert 572 from the proximal end 726 of the
patient's tibia 720. To do so, the surgeon may attach a removal tool 750 to the impaction
handle 740, as shown in FIG. 29. The removal tool 750 has a slot 752 defined therein sized
to receive the button head 514 of the fastener 512 and a pair of engagement arms 754
configured to be positioned between the button head 514 and the plate 442 of the tibial
base trial 436. When the removal tool 750 is positioned as shown in FIG. 29, the surgeon
may pull in the direction indicated by arrow 756 to disengage the tibial tray trial 432 and

                                               40
the punch insert 572 from the tibia 720 such that the surgeon may proceed with the
implantation of the prosthetic components.
[0176]          Returning to block 804, if the surgeon determines a prosthetic sleeve is
necessary, the procedure 800 advances to procedure block 806 in FIG. 21B. In procedure
block 806, the surgeon selects a stem trial 20 and a broach assembly 22. As described
above, multiple stem trials 20 and/or broach assemblies 22 may be provided to
accommodate prosthetic components of different sizes. When the surgeon has selected a
stem trial 20 and the broach assembly 22, the surgeon may assemble the instruments to
form an intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 16. To do so, the surgeon aligns
the upper end 272 of the stem trial 20 with the aperture 302 defined in the tip 286 of the
broach 280. The surgeon may advance the upper end 272 of the trial 20 into contact with
the inner wall 304 of the broach 280 to engage the external threads 274 formed on the trial
20 with the internal threads of the reamer 18. The surgeon may thread the trial 20 into the
broach 280 to secure the instruments together.
[0177]          After the intramedullary orthopaedic surgical instrument 16 is assembled in
block 806, the procedure 800 advances to procedure block 828. In block 828, the surgeon
may advance the stem trial 20 and the broach assembly 22 into the medullary canal 254, as
shown in FIG. 30. To do so, the surgeon may secure the broach assembly 22 with the
impaction handle 740 by engaging the catch of the impaction handle 740 with the flange
354 of the broach 280. After securing the handle 740 to the broach assembly 22, the
surgeon may align the stem trial 20 with the medullary canal 254. The surgeon may then
drive the stem trial 20 and the broach assembly 22 into the tibia 720 by striking the handle
740 with mallet, sledge, or other impaction tool. As the broach assembly 22 is driven into
the bone, the cutting teeth 290 of the broach 280 and the cutting teeth 388 of the broach
insert 282 engage the patient's tibia 720 to shape the medullary canal 254 to receive the
prosthetic sleeve.
[0178]          The procedure 800 may then advance to procedure block 830 in which the
surgeon removes the broach insert 282 from the broach 280. To do so, the surgeon may
reorient the impaction handle 740 to engage the catch with the flange 380 of the broach
insert 282. As shown from the posterior perspective view in FIG. 31, the surgeon may pull

                                               41
the handle 740 in the direction indicated by arrow 758 to disengage the cutting teeth 388 of
the broach insert 282 and detach the broach insert 282 from the broach 280.
[0179]          After the broach insert 282 is removed in block 832, the surgeon may secure
the attachment device 12 to the broach 280 in procedure block 832. To do so, the surgeon
may attach the adaptor 400 to the broach 280, as shown the posterior perspective view in
FIG. 32. The surgeon may align the post 416 of the adaptor 400 with the bore 338 defined
in the platform 328 of the broach 280 before advancing the adaptor 400 downward such
that the plug 404 is positioned in the slot 316 of the broach 280 and the post 416 is
received in the bore 338. The biasing element 418 engages the inner wall 310 of the broach
280 to secure the adaptor 400 to the broach 280. When the adaptor 400 is properly
positioned on the broach 280, the base 402 of the adaptor 400 is seated on the top surface
306, and the shaft 422 extends upwardly from the tibia 720.
[0180]          The surgeon may secure the attachment device 12 to the adaptor 400 by
aligning the passageway 64 of the attachment base 30 with the shaft 422. The surgeon may
then press on the handles 82 of the levers 72 in the direction indicated by arrows 730 in
FIG. 33 to rotate the levers 72 and remove the catches 78 from the passageway 64. The
surgeon may advance the attachment base 30 downward over the shaft 422 until the lower
end 42 of the base 30 engages the plug 404 of the adaptor 400 and the top surface 306 of
the broach 280. The surgeon may release the handles 82, thereby permitting the springs
100 to rotate the levers 72 into the engaged position. In that position, the catches 78 are
received in the 424 formed in the shaft 422, thereby securing the attachment device 12 to
the adaptor 400 (and hence the broach 280).
[0181]          Returning to FIG. 21B, the procedure may advance to block 814 in which
the cutting block 14 is moved into position for the resection of the proximal end 726 of the
patient's tibia 720. As described above, the surgeon may secure the cutting block 14 to the
mounting frame 32 and position the mounting frame 32 on the rails 36, 38 of the
attachment base 30. The surgeon may then move the mounting frame 32 (and hence cutting
block 14) into position relative to the tibia 720.

                                                 42
[0182]          The procedure 800 may then advance to procedure block 834 in which the
surgeon performs the resection of the tibia 720. Similar to procedure block 816 described
above, the surgeon may use the cutting guides 220 defined in the cutting block 14, as
shown in FIG. 24. For example, the surgeon may select the cutting guide 220 of the cutting
block 14 corresponding to a desired amount of bone to be removed. The surgeon may
perform the resection by inserting a bone saw blade 732 into the selected cutting guide 220
of the cutting block 14. The resection removes a proximal portion of the patient's tibia 720
to create a substantially planar proximal surface 734.
[0183]          After performing the resection, the surgeon may assemble a tibial tray trial
432 in procedure block 836. To do so, the surgeon may secure the base trial 436 to the
broach 280 via the fastener 512. The base trial 436 may aligned with the broach 280 and
the lower end 518 of the fastener 512 is advanced into the bore 338. The external threads
522 formed on the fastener 512 are advanced into contact with the internal threads 346 of
the broach 280. By rotating the fastener 512 about the longitudinal axis 530 using the
button head 514, the internal threads 346 are engaged with external threads 522, thereby
securing the broach 280 to the base trial 436. When the base trial 436 is seated on the top
surface 306 of the broach 280, the outer sleeve 520 of the fastener 512 is positioned in the
bore 338 of the broach 280, and the tibial base trial 436 is engaged with the surgically
prepared proximal surface 734 of the tibia 720.
[0184]          After the tibial tray trial 432 is positioned, the surgeon may perform a trial
reduction in procedure block 822. As described above, the surgeon may position the check
insert 570 in the plate opening 450 of the tibial base trial 436 before selecting a trial shim
682 and a tibial bearing surface trial 680. Thereafter, the surgeon may adjust the patient's
leg to evaluate performance and ascertain which implant size and configuration (e.g., the
thickness of the implant, the mobility of the implant, etc.) will have the best stability in
flexion and extension while permitting the desired kinematics. Because the base trial 436 is
permitted to rotate relative to the broach 280, the surgeon is able to establish the rotational
position of the tibial tray prosthetic component based on the femoral position and best fit
coverage of the tibial plateau.

                                                43
[0185]          As shown in FIG. 21B, the procedure 800 may advance to procedure block
838 in which the surgeon continues the tibial preparation by impacting the keel punch
insert 572 into the proximal end 726 of the tibia 720. Similar to procedure block 824
described above, the surgeon removes the check insert 570 from the base trial 436, as
shown in FIG. 28. The surgeon may then secure the punch insert 572 to the attachment tool
566 by aligning the pegs 598, 604 of the attachment tool 566 with the bores 558, 560,
respectively, of the punch insert 572 and advancing the pegs 598, 604 into the bores 558,
560.
[0186]          The surgeon may secure the attachment tool 566 to an impaction handle 740
by engaging a catch (not shown) of the impaction handle 740 with the flange 616 formed
on the attachment tool 566. After securing the handle 740 to the tool 566 and the punch
insert 572, the surgeon may align the lower arms 574, 576 of the punch insert 572 with the
passageways 460, 462 defined in the base trial 436. The surgeon may then advance the
punch insert 572 downward such that the lower arms 574, 576 pass through the
passageways 460, 462 and into the proximal end 726 of the tibia 720.
[0187]          The surgeon may then drive the punch insert 572 into the tibia 720 by
striking the handle 740 with mallet, sledge, or other impaction tool. As the punch insert
572 is driven into the bone, the cutting teeth 580 of the punch insert 572 engage the
patient's tibia 720 to form additional slots (not shown) in the tibia 720. When the punch
insert 572 is seated on the tibial base trial 436, the lower arms 574, 576 extend outwardly
from the slot 316 defined in the broach 280.
[0188]          After the keel punch insert 572 has been driven into the tibia 720, the
procedure 800 may advance to the procedure block 824. In block 824, the surgeon may
remove the tibial tray trial 432 and the punch insert 572 from the proximal end 726 of the
patient's tibia 720. To do so, the surgeon may attach a removal tool 750 to the impaction
handle 740 and use the removal tool to the tibial base trial 436, the punch insert 572,
broach 280, and stem trial 20 from the tibia 720 such that the surgeon may proceed with
the implantation of the prosthetic components.
