                           ABSTRACT
       An elongate formwork element for use in the
  construction of a concrete floor is disclosed.             The
5 formwork element includes a base wall   (15) and a side wall
  (17) extending from one side edge of the base wall so that
  the element is generally L-shaped in transverse section.
                                        10265352_1 (GHMatters) P59112.AU.4 11/05/18

             The present invention relates generally to cast
 5 in situ concrete beams for use in the building industry.
             The present invention relates particularly,
   although by no means exclusively, to concrete beams that
   form part of cast in situ concrete floors, hereinafter
10 referred to as "concrete floors",  such as mezzanine floors
   and floors for multi-storey buildings, including multi
   storey carparks.
             The present invention relates particularly,
15 although by no means exclusively, to concrete floors that
   include concrete beams.
        The present invention also relates more particularly,
   although by no means exclusively, to formwork elements for
20 constructing concrete floors, particularly formwork
   elements for constructing beams of concrete floors, and to
   concrete floors made using the formwork elements.
             In the context of the construction of floors,
25 the term "concrete floor" is understood herein to include
   (a) one or more than one concrete beam and (b) one or more
   than one a concrete slab section extending outwardly from
   the beam or beams as a part of the floor.
30           In the context of the construction of floors, the
   term "concrete floor" is understood herein to further
   include:
              (a) a base of the floor that includes a
35                formwork in the form of a plurality of
                  profiled decking sheets positioned in side
                  by-side and/or end-to-end relationship as
                                          10265352_1 (GHMatters) P59112.AU.4 11/05/18

                              - 2
                  required and other formwork elements as
                  required to form the base;      and
              (b) a layer of concrete on the base.
 5
             Typically, in the context of the construction of
   floors, the term "concrete floor" is understood herein to
   include reinforcement embedded in the concrete layer.
   Such reinforcement may be in the concrete of the beam or
10 beams and/or in the concrete of the slab section or
   sections.
             The profiled decking sheets and other formwork
   elements of the concrete floor may contribute to the
15 mechanical performance of the concrete floor.
   Specifically, the profiled decking sheets and other
   formwork elements may act compositely with the concrete
   via mechanical bonding and therefore contribute to the
   reinforcement of the concrete floor.
20
             Notwithstanding the above, the present invention
   extends to arrangements in which the profiled decking
   sheets and other formwork elements do not make a
   contribution to the mechanical performance of the concrete
25 floor and the profiled decking sheets and other formwork
   elements act as lost formwork only.
             Typically, a concrete floor is formed in situ by:
30            (a) positioning a plurality of profiled decking
                  sheets and other formwork elements onto a
                  permanent support structure and forming a
                  continuous base of the floor,
35            (b) positioning formwork that defines the outer
                  side wall perimeter of the concrete floor,
                                         10265352_1 (GHMatters) P59112.AU.4 11/05/18

                               - 3
             (c)  placing reinforcement, typically in the
                   form of flat sheets of steel mesh or bars,
                   or both mesh and bars, on or in relation to
                   the profiled decking sheets and other
 5                 formwork elements, and
             (d)   finally pouring concrete onto the assembly
                   of the decking sheets and other formwork
                   elements and reinforcement within the
10                perimeter of the formwork and forming a
                   layer of concrete.
             Depending on a number of factors, including the
   shapes of the profiled decking sheets and other formwork
15 elements, the weight of concrete required to form a
   concrete floor, the span between adjacent permanent
   support members, deflection limits, the concrete pour
   sequence, the number of spans, the means of fixing to the
   permanent support structure, and construction loads                  (other
20 than wet concrete),  the profiled decking sheets and other
   formwork elements may need to be propped temporarily
   between the permanent support members.
             The term "profiled decking sheet" is understood
25 herein to mean roll-formed sheets or brake pressed sheets
   that, typically  (although by no means exclusively),
   include at least one pan and side edge formations that
   enable adjacent sheets to be positioned together in side
   by-side relationship.
30
             In situations in which a profiled decking sheet
   includes two or more than two pans, typically            (although by
   no means exclusively),  the term "profiled decking sheet"
   is understood herein to include one or more than one
35 upstanding rib separating adjacent pans.
                                          10265352_1 (GHMatters) P59112.AU.4 11/05/18

                               -  4
             The present invention provides an elongate
   formwork element that is particularly well suited for use
   as part of the formwork for   concrete beams of a            concrete
   floor.
 5
             According to the present invention there is
   provided an elongate formwork element for use in the
   construction of a concrete floor, which formwork element
   includes a base wall and a side wall extending from one
10 side edge of the base wall so that the element is
   generally L-shaped in transverse section.
             Preferably the formwork element is adapted to
   interlock, in use, with a horizontally disposed profiled
15 decking sheet so that the side wall extends upwardly from
   a side edge of the profiled decking sheet.
             The formwork element is particularly suitable for
   use as part of the formwork of a concrete beam of a
20 concrete floor.   In this application, the beam formwork is
   defined by:
              (a)  one or more than one profiled decking sheet
                   that forms a base of the beam formwork, and
25
              (b)  one or more than one of the formwork
                   element positioned on opposite sides of the
                   profiled decking sheet or sheets and
                   interlocked with the profiled decking sheet
30                 or sheets and forming the sides of the beam
                   formwork.
             The formwork element is also suitable for use as
   other parts of the formwork of a concrete floor.
35
             In a number of applications it is not necessary
   that the side wall of the formwork element be a load
                                           10265352_1 (GHMatters) P59112.AU.4 11/05/18

                                        -   5
    bearing element.        Therefore, the formwork element can be
    made, by way of example, form small gauge steel.                             The term
    "small" gauge steel is understood herein to mean steel
    that is less than 1 mm thickness.
  5
                 Preferably the side wall of the formwork element
    includes   a strengthening member.            The strengthening member
    reduces  lateral    deflection       (bulging) of the side wall when
    wet concrete is poured and bears against the side wall.
10  The strengthening member also makes it possible to use
    lighter gauge steel to make the side wall than would
    otherwise be the case.
                 Preferably the strengthening member is                       in    the
15  form of a plurality         of ribs   in   the side wall of the
    formwork element.
                 Preferably the ribs          extend transversely               to    the
    length direction     of the formwork element.
20
                 Preferably the ribs          extend at     least      substantially
    between the base wall and a           free   end of the side wall.                      In
    a situation in which the formwork element is interlocked
    with a horizontally disposed profiled decking sheet so
25  that the side wall extends upwardly from a side edge of
    the profiled decking sheet, the ribs extend upwardly at
    least substantially between the base wall and the free,
    i.e. upper, end of the side wall.
30               Preferably the ribs          are in the form of deep
    embossments that make it possible for the side wall to act
    compositely with the concrete layer.
                 The term "deep" as used herein in the context of
35  the embossments means that          the depth of the embossments is
    at least   2 mm and more preferably           at  least       3 mm.
                                                       10265352_1 (GHMatters) P59112.AU.4 11/05/18

                                  -   6
              Preferably the base wall is shaped to interlock
   with the profiled decking sheet.
              Preferably the base wall is shaped to interlock
 5 with the profiled decking sheet without the use of
   mechanical fasteners.
              In a situation in which the profiled decking
   sheet includes at least one rib, preferably the base wall
10 includes an upturned lip that is adapted to extend into a
   rib of the profiled decking sheet and the length of the
   base wall is selected so that, in use, the formwork
   element can be positioned so that the base wall is
   positioned against an undersurface of the profiled decking
15 sheet at one side of the sheet and the lip extends into
   and engages the rib of the sheet.
              Preferably an upper end of the side wall includes
   an end formation that defines a platform on which one or
20 more than one profiled decking sheet can be located and
   secured, preferably  by fasteners.
             With the arrangement described in the preceding
   paragraph, it is possible to assemble together the
25 formwork for an elongate concrete beam and sections of a
   concrete slab extending outwardly from one or both sides
   of the beam.
              In particular, with this arrangement, it is
30 possible to pre-assemble sections of the formwork for a
   concrete floor on the ground and thereafter lift the
   sections into a required location on a building under
   construction.
35            Preferably the end formation includes a lip that
   is adapted to contact edges, which are typically sharp
   edges, of the ends of profiled decking sheets positioned
                                          10265352_1 (GHMatters) P59112.AU.4 11/05/18

   on the end formation.   The lip forms an end cap that
   prevents flow  (and thereby loss) of concrete through deck
   voids, such as the ribs of profiled decking sheets.                   In
   addition, the lip covers sharp edges that may result in
 5 injury to workers assembling and/or installing the
   formwork.
             According to the present invention there is also
   provided an assembly of a plurality of profiled decking
10 sheets and a plurality of the above-described formwork
   element that form a formwork of a base of a part of a beam
   and slab sections of a concrete floor.
             The above-described assembly can be put together
15 on the ground and then lifted into a required position on
   a building under construction.
             Preferably the assembly includes the formwork
   elements that form the sides of the beam formwork being
20 interlocked with the profiled decking sheets that form the
   base of the beam formwork.
             Preferably the upper ends of the formwork
   elements that form the sides of the beam formwork defining
25 a support platform that supports the profiled decking
   sheets that form the base formwork of the slab sections.
             Preferably the assembly includes a safety rail.
30           The safety rail is an important safety feature
   for persons constructing a concrete floor when the
   assembly is lifted into position.
             In addition, the safety rail stiffens the
35 assembly and contributes to maintaining the integrity of
   the assembly as it is lifted from the ground into a
   required position.
                                          10265352_1 (GHMatters) P59112.AU.4 11/05/18

                              - 8
             According to the present invention there is also
   provided a concrete floor that includes one or more than
   one concrete beam and a concrete slab section extending
 5 outwardly from the beam as a part of the floor and further
   includes:
              (a) a base that includes a formwork in the form
                  of an assembly of a plurality of profiled
10                decking sheets and a plurality of the
                  above-described formwork element, and
              (a) a layer of concrete on the base.
15           Preferably, the profiled decking sheets are pre
   cambered along the length of the sheets.
             Preferably the profiled decking sheets are pre
   cambered along the length of the sheets so that the pans
20 of the sheets form flat, horizontal surfaces when wet
   concrete is poured to form the concrete floor.
             Preferably the concrete floor further includes
   reinforcement, such as steel mesh, embedded in the
25 concrete.
             The reinforcement may be pre- or post- tensioned.
             The reinforcement may be welded or otherwise
30 connected to the side edge formations and/or the ribs of
   the profiled decking sheets to increase the resistance to
   lateral deflection under load.
             The present invention is described further by way
35 of example with reference to the accompanying Figures, of
   which:
                                         10265352_1 (GHMatters) P59112.AU.4 11/05/18

                                 -  9
              Figure 1 is a vertical cross-section through a
   part of one embodiment of a concrete floor in accordance
   with the present invention;     and
 5            Figure 2 is a perspective view of one embodiment
   of a formwork element in accordance with the present
   invention that forms a part of the concrete floor shown in
   Figure 1.
10            The part of the concrete floor shown in Figure 1
   includes an elongate concrete beam 3      (extending into the
   page) and a horizontal concrete slab section 5 extending
   outwardly from each side of the beam 3, as shown in the
   Figure.
15
              The part of the concrete floor shown in Figure 1
   is formed from:
               (a) a continuous base in the form of a formwork
20                 that includes an assembly of a plurality of
                   horizontal steel profiled decking sheets 7
                   and vertical steel formwork elements 9,
               (b) a layer of concrete 11 on the base;                   and
25
               (c) reinforcement in the form of a steel mesh
                   13 embedded in the concrete layer 11.
              The base is supported by a plurality of permanent
30 support members   (not shown).     By way of example, the
   permanent support members may be in the form of columns.
              The profiled decking sheets 7 may be of any
   suitable  configuration.
35
                                              10265352_1 (GHMatters) P59112.AU.4 11/05/18

                              - 10
             Moreover, it is not necessary that the same
   profiled decking sheets 7 be used to form the base of the
   beam 3 and the base of each slab section 5.
 5           Figure 1 shows that the base of the beam 3
   includes two profiled decking sheets 7 positioned side-by
   side in overlapping relationship.   Each profiled decking
   sheet 7 includes three pans 31 separated by parallel open
   ribs 33 and side edge formations 35.
10
             Figure 1 shows two formwork elements 9 that form
   opposite sides of the beam 3.
             Each formwork element 9 is made form small gauge
15 steel having a thickness of 0.75 mm and includes a base
   wall 15 and a non-load bearing side wall 17 extending
   upwardly (as viewed in Figure 1)  from one side edge of the
   base wall 15 so that the element 9 is generally L-shaped
   in transverse section.
20
             Each formwork element 9 is formed so that it can
   interlock with an adjacent horizontal profiled decking
   sheet 7 of the base of the beam 3, without the use of
   mechanical fasteners, so that the side wall 17 of the
25 element 9 extends upwardly from a side edge of the sheet 7
   and is held in that position.   The interlocking of the
   formwork elements 9 and the profiled decking sheets 7 is
   advantageous because it assembles the components together
   and this simplifies construction of the concrete slab and
30 allows the components and the concrete to act compositely.
             The side wall 17 of each formwork element 9
   includes a strengthening member in the form of a series of
   parallel ribs 21 of 3 mm depth that extend vertically at
35 least substantially between the base wall 15 and an upper
   end of the side wall 17.  The ribs 21 are deep ribs and
   consequently make it possible for the side walls 17 to act
                                          10265352_1 (GHMatters) P59112.AU.4 11/05/18

                               - 11
   compositely with the concrete layer.     In addition, the
   ribs 21 make it possible to use lighter gauge steel to
   make the side wall 17 than would otherwise be the case.
 5            The base wall 15 of each formwork element 9 is
   shaped to interlock with the profiled decking sheet 7.
              Specifically, the base wall 15 of each formwork
   element 9 includes an upturned lip 37 that is adapted to
10 extend into and engage the closest rib 33 to the formwork
   element 9.   In addition, the length L    (see Figure 2)               of
   the base wall 15 of each formwork element 9 is selected so
   that, when the formwork element 9 is positioned with the
   base wall 15 against an undersurface of the profiled
15 decking sheet 7 and with the lip 37 extending into and
   engaging the rib 35, the side wall 17 of the element 9
   bears against the outer side edge formation 35 of the
   sheet 7, with the result that the formwork element 9 and
   the profiled decking sheet 7 are interlocked together.
20
              The side wall 17 of each formwork element 9
   includes an end formation 39 at an upper end thereof.                      The
   end formation 39 defines a platform on which one or more
   than one profiled decking sheet 7 for the base of the
25 floor sections 5 are located and secured by fasteners 41.
              The upper end formation 39 of the side wall 17 of
   each formwork element 9 includes a lip 43 that contacts
   the edges, which are typically sharp edges, of the ends of
30 profiled decking sheets 7 of the base of the slab sections
   5 that are on the end formation 39.    The lip 43 is
   provided as a safety feature to minimize injury during
   construction of the concrete slab.   Moreover, for safety
   reasons, the lip 43 has a small rounded return at the
35 upper end so that it does not present a sharp edge.                    In
   addition, the lip 43 functions as an end cap for the ribs

15 be positioned on the assembly for subsequent use as a
   safety measure after the assembly has been lifted into
   position and as a means of improving the rigidity of the
   assembly.
20           Many modifications may be made to the embodiment
   of the present invention described above without departing
   from the spirit and scope of the invention.
             By way of example, whilst the description of the
25 embodiment indicates that the profiled decking sheets 7
   and the formwork elements 9 can be assembled together to
   form the formwork on the ground at a building site and
