   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention relates to isolated nucleic acid molecules capable of regulating
   expression in plants as well as expression cassettes, vectors and transgenic plants
   comprising the same.

   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Manipulation of plants to alter and/or improve phenotypic characteristics (such as
   productivity, quality or pest resistance) requires the expression of heterologous genes in
   plant tissues. Such genetic manipulation relies on the availability of a means to drive and to
15 control gene expression as required. For example, genetic manipulation relies on the
   availability and use of suitable promoters which are effective in plants and which regulate
   gene expression so as to give the desired effect(s) in the transgenic plant. For numerous
   applications in plant biotechnology a tissue-specific expression profile is advantageous,
   since beneficial effects of expression in one tissue may have disadvantages in others. For
20 example, promoters driving expression in the plant epidermis, such as epidermis-preferential
   or epidermis-specific promoters are useful for expressing genes that prevent pathogens
   such as fungi or bacteria from infecting a plant through the epidermis. It is advantageous to
   have the choice of a variety of different promoters so that the most suitable promoter may be
   selected for a particular gene, construct, cell, tissue, plant or environment. Moreover, the
25 increasing interest in transforming plants with multiple plant transcription units (PTU) and the
   potential problems associated with using common regulatory molecules for these purposes
   merit having a variety of promoter molecules available.
   There is, therefore, a constant need in the art for the identification of novel molecules that
30 can be used for expression of selected transgenes in economically important plants. It is
   thus an objective of the present invention to provide new and alternative expression
   cassettes for expression of transgenes in various tissues of plants, for example in the
   epidermis. The objective is solved by the present invention.

   knowledge in the art in Australia or any other country.

   In a preferred embodiment, the isolated nucleic acid molecules capable of regulating
   expression in plants having a sequence as defined above under ii) comprise a minimal
   promoter, preferably the minimal promoter of the respective isolated nucleic acid molecule.

   Another embodiment of the invention is an expression cassette for regulating expression in
   plants comprising
   a)              at least one isolated nucleic acid molecule capable of regulating expression in
                   plants as defined above,
 5 and functionally linked thereto
   b)              at least one nucleic acid molecule which is heterologous in relation to said
                   transcription regulating nucleotide molecule which is to be expressed in a plant or
                   part thereof.
10 The heterologous nucleotide molecule to be expressed in a plant or part thereof is preferably
   furthermore operably linked to introns, having expression enhancing effects, NEENAs
   (W02011023537, W02011023539),                   5' and   or 3'-untranslated    regions, transcription
   termination and/or polyadenylation signals. 3'-untranslated regions are suitable to stabilize
   mRNA expression and structure. This can result in prolonged presence of the mRNA and
15 thus enhanced expression levels. Termination and polyadenylation signals are suitable to
   stabilize mRNA expression (e.g., by stabilization of the RNA transcript and thereby the RNA
   level) to ensure constant mRNA transcript length and to prevent read-through transcription.
   Especially in multigene expression constructs this is an important feature. Furthermore
   correct termination of transcription is linked to re-initiation of transcription from the regulatory
20 5'nucleotide sequence resulting in enhanced expression levels. The above-mentioned
   signals can be any signal functional in plants and can for example be isolated from plant
   genes, plant virus genes or other plant pathogens. However, in a preferred embodiment the
   3'-untranslated regions, transcription termination and polyadenylation signals are from the
   genes employed as the source for the promoters of this invention.
25
   The transcription regulating molecules of the invention can be utilized to express any kind of
   nucleic acid molecule. For example, expression of the nucleic acid molecule can result in
   expression of a protein, or expression of an antisense RNA, sense or double-stranded RNA.
   Preferably, expression of the nucleic acid molecule confers to the plant an agronomically
30 valuable trait.
   Another embodiment of the invention relates to a vector comprising an isolated nucleic acid
   molecule or an expression cassette of the invention. Yet another embodiment of the
   invention relates to a transgenic host cell or non-human organism comprising an expression
35 cassette or a vector of the invention. Yet another embodiment of the invention relates to a
   transgenic plant or plant cell comprising an expression cassette or a vector of the invention.

   Fabacea, more preferably of the genus Glycine, most preferably the species Glycine max.

   plant comprising the steps of
10 a.            providing an expression cassette as defined above or a vector as defined above and

   c.            regenerating a plant from said transformed plant part or plant cell.
   An additional embodiment of the invention is a method for providing an expression cassette
15 comprising an isolated nucleic acid molecule capable of regulating expression in plants
   comprising the steps of

                 consecutive bp, preferably at least 20 consecutive bp of a sequence described by
                 SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 or 220, 222,

25 DEFINITIONS
   It is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular methodology,
   protocols, cell lines, plant species or genera, constructs, and reagents described as such. It
   is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing
   particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention,
30 which will be limited only by the appended claims. It must be noted that as used herein and
   in the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "and," and "the" include plural reference
   unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a vector" is a
   reference to one or more vectors and includes equivalents thereof known to those skilled in
   the art, and so forth.
35
   In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the context
   requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word "comprise" or
   variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify
   the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further
40 features in various embodiments of the invention.
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                         8
   The term "about" is used herein to mean approximately, roughly, around, or in the region of.
   When the term "about" is used in conjunction with a numerical range, it modifies that range
   by extending the boundaries above and below the numerical values set forth. In general, the
 5 term "about" is used herein to modify a numerical value above and below the stated value by
   a variance of 20 percent, preferably 10 percent up or down (higher or lower).
   As used herein, the word "or" means any one member of a particular list and also includes
   any combination of members of that list.
10
   The term "gene" is used broadly to refer to any segment of nucleic acid associated with a
   biological function. Thus, genes include coding sequences and/or the regulatory molecules
   required for their expression. For example, gene refers to a nucleic acid fragment that
   expresses mRNA or functional RNA, or encodes a specific protein, and which includes
15 regulatory molecules. Genes also include non-expressed DNA segments that, for example,
   form recognition sequences for other proteins. Genes can be obtained from a variety of
   sources, including cloning from a source of interest or synthesizing from known or predicted
   sequence information, and may include sequences designed to have desired parameters.
20 The term "native" or "wild type" gene refers to a gene that is present in the genome of an
   untransformed cell, i.e., a cell not having a known mutation.
   A "marker gene" encodes a selectable or screenable trait.
25 The term "chimeric gene" refers to any gene that contains
   1)            DNA sequences, including regulatory and           coding sequences, that are not
                 functionally linked together in nature, or
   2)            sequences encoding parts of proteins not naturally adjoined, or
   3)            parts of promoters that are not naturally adjoined.
30
   Accordingly, a chimeric gene may comprise regulatory molecules and coding sequences
   that are derived from different sources, or comprise regulatory molecules, and coding
   sequences derived from the same source, but arranged in a manner different from that
   found in nature.
35
   A "transgene" refers to a gene that has been introduced into the genome by transformation
   and is stably maintained. Transgenes may include, for example, genes that are either
   heterologous or homologous to the genes of a particular plant to be transformed.
   Additionally, transgenes may comprise native genes inserted into a non-native organism, or
40 chimeric genes. The term "endogenous gene" refers to a native gene in its natural location in
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                  9
   the genome of an organism. A "foreign" gene refers to a gene not normally found in the host
   organism but that is introduced by gene transfer.
   An "oligonucleotide" corresponding to a nucleotide sequence of the invention, e.g., for use in
 5 probing or amplification reactions, may be about 30 or fewer nucleotides in length (e.g., 9,
   12, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, or 24, or any number between 9 and 30). Generally specific
   primers are upwards of 14 nucleotides in length. For optimum specificity and cost
   effectiveness, primers of 16 to 24 nucleotides in length may be preferred. Those skilled in
   the art are well versed in the design of primers for use processes such as PCR. If required,
10 probing can be done with entire restriction fragments of the gene disclosed herein which
   may be 100's or even 1000's of nucleotides in length.
   The terms "polypeptide", "peptide", "oligopeptide", "gene product", "expression product" and
   "protein" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer or oligomer of consecutive
15 amino acid residues. As used herein, the term "amino acid sequence" or a "polypeptide
   sequence" refers to a list of abbreviations, letters, characters or words representing amino
   acid residues. Amino acids may be referred to herein by either their commonly known three
   letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical
   Nomenclature Commission. The abbreviations used herein are conventional one letter
20 codes for the amino acids: A, alanine; B, asparagine or aspartic acid; C, cysteine; D aspartic
   acid; E, glutamate, glutamic acid; F, phenylalanine; G, glycine; H histidine; I isoleucine; K,
   lysine; L, leucine; M, methionine; N, asparagine; P, proline; Q, glutamine; R, arginine ; S,
   serine; T, threonine; V, valine; W, tryptophan; Y, tyrosine; Z, glutamine or glutamic acid (see
   L. Stryer, Biochemistry, 1988, W. H. Freeman and Company, New York. The letter "x" as
25 used herein within an amino acid sequence can stand for any amino acid residue.
   "Coding sequence" refers to a DNA or RNA molecule that codes for a specific amino acid
   molecule and excludes the non-coding sequences. It may constitute an "uninterrupted
   coding sequence", i.e., lacking an intron, such as in a cDNA or it may include one or more
30 introns bounded by appropriate splice junctions. An "intron" is a molecule of RNA which is
   contained in the primary transcript but which is removed through cleavage and re-ligation of
   the RNA within the cell to create the mature mRNA that can be translated into a protein.
   The terms "open reading frame" and "ORF" refer to the amino acid sequence encoded
35 between translation initiation and termination codons of a coding sequence. The terms
   "initiation codon" and "termination codon" refer to a unit of three adjacent nucleotides
   ('codon') in a coding sequence that specifies initiation and chain termination, respectively, of
   protein synthesis (mRNA translation).

                                                   10
   A "functional RNA" refers to an antisense RNA, microRNA, siRNA, ribozyme, or other RNA
   that is not translated.
   The term "RNA transcript" refers to the product resulting from RNA polymerase catalyzed
 5 transcription of a DNA molecule. When the RNA transcript is a perfect complementary copy
   of the DNA molecule, it is referred to as the primary transcript or it may be a RNA molecule
   derived from posttranscriptional processing of the primary transcript and is referred to as the
   mature RNA. "Messenger RNA" (mRNA) refers to the RNA that is without introns and that
   can be translated into protein by the cell. "cDNA" refers to a single- or a double-stranded
10 DNA that is complementary to and derived from mRNA.
   "Isolated nucleic acid molecule capable of regulating expression", ,,transcription regulating
   nucleotide molecule", "regulatory molecule", or "suitable regulatory molecules", each refer to
   nucleotide molecules influencing the transcription, RNA processing or stability, or translation
15 of the associated (or functionally linked) nucleotide molecules to be transcribed. The
   transcription regulating nucleotide molecule may have various localizations with respect to
   the nucleotide molecules to be transcribed. The transcription regulating nucleotide molecule
   may be located upstream (5' non-coding sequences), within, or downstream (3' non-coding
   sequences) of the molecule to be transcribed (e.g., a coding sequence). The transcription
20 regulating nucleotide molecule may be selected from the group comprising enhancers,
   promoters, translation leader sequences, introns, 5-untranslated sequences, 3'-untranslated
   sequences, and polyadenylation signal sequences. They include natural and synthetic
   molecules as well as molecules, which may be a combination of synthetic and natural
   molecules. As is noted above, the term "transcription regulating nucleotide molecule" is not
25 limited to promoters. However, preferably a transcription regulating nucleotide molecule of
   the invention comprises at least one promoter molecule (e.g., a molecule localized upstream
   of the transcription start of a gene capable to induce transcription of the downstream
   molecules). In one preferred embodiment the transcription regulating nucleotide molecule of
   the invention comprises the promoter molecule of the corresponding gene and - optionally
30 and preferably - the native 5-untranslated region of said gene. Furthermore, the 3'
   untranslated region and/or the polyadenylation region of said gene may also be employed.
   As used herein, the term "cis-element" or "promoter motif" refers to a cis-acting
   transcriptional regulatory element that confers an aspect of the overall control of gene
   expression. A cis-element may function to bind transcription factors, trans-acting protein
35 factors that regulate transcription. Some cis-elements bind more than one transcription
   factor, and transcription factors may interact with different affinities with more than one cis
   element. The promoters of the present invention desirably contain cis-elements that can
   confer or modulate gene expression. Cis-elements can be identified by a number of
   techniques, including deletion analysis, i.e., deleting one or more nucleotides from the 5' end
40 or internal to a promoter; DNA binding protein analysis using DNase I footprinting,

                                                   11
   methylation interference, electrophoresis mobility-shift assays, in vivo genomic footprinting
   by ligation-mediated PCR, and other conventional assays; or by DNA sequence similarity
   analysis with known cis-element motifs by conventional DNA sequence comparison
   methods. The fine structure of a cis-element can be further studied by mutagenesis (or
 5 substitution) of one or more nucleotides or by other conventional methods. Cis-elements can
   be obtained by chemical synthesis or by isolation from promoters that include such
   elements, and they can be synthesized with additional flanking nucleotides that contain
   useful restriction enzyme sites to facilitate subsequent manipulation.
10 "5' non-coding sequence" or "5'-untranslated sequence" or "-region" refers to a sequence of
   a nucleotide molecule located 5' (upstream) to the coding sequence. It is present in the fully
   processed mRNA upstream of the initiation codon and may affect processing of the primary
   transcript to mRNA, mRNA stability or translation efficiency.
15 "3' non-coding sequence" or "3'-untranslated sequence" or "-region" refers to a sequence of
   a nucleotide molecule located 3' (downstream) to a coding sequence and include
   polyadenylation signal sequences and other sequences encoding regulatory signals capable
   of affecting mRNA processing or gene expression. The polyadenylation signal is usually
   characterized by affecting the addition of polyadenylic acid tracts to the 3' end of the mRNA
20 precursor. The use of different 3' non-coding sequences is exemplified by Ingelbrecht et al.,
   1989.
   The term "translation leader sequence" refers to that DNA sequence portion of a gene
   between the promoter and coding sequence that is transcribed into RNA and is present in
25 the fully processed mRNA upstream (5') of the translation start codon. The translation leader
   sequence may affect processing of the primary transcript to mRNA, mRNA stability or
   translation efficiency.
   "Signal peptide" refers to the amino terminal extension of a polypeptide, which is translated
30 in conjunction with the polypeptide forming a precursor peptide and which is required for its
   entrance into the secretory pathway. The term "signal sequence" refers to a nucleotide
   sequence that encodes the signal peptide. The term "transit peptide" as used herein refers
   part of an expressed polypeptide (preferably to the amino terminal extension of a
   polypeptide), which is translated in conjunction with the polypeptide forming a precursor
35 peptide and which is required for its entrance into a cell organelle (such as the plastids (e.g.,
   chloroplasts) or mitochondria). The term "transit sequence" refers to a nucleotide sequence
   that encodes the transit peptide.
   "Promoter" refers to a nucleotide molecule, usually upstream (5') to its coding sequence,
40 which controls the expression of the coding sequence by providing the recognition for RNA
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                    12
   polymerase and other factors required for proper transcription. "Promoter" includes a
   minimal promoter that is a short DNA sequence comprised of a TATA box and other
   sequences that serve to specify the site of transcription initiation, to which regulatory
   elements are added for control of expression. "Promoter" also refers to a nucleotide
 5 molecule that includes a minimal promoter plus regulatory elements that is capable of
   controlling the expression of a coding sequence or functional RNA. This type of promoter
   molecule consists of proximal and more distal upstream elements, the latter elements often
   referred to as enhancers. Accordingly, an "enhancer" is a DNA molecule, which can
   stimulate promoter activity and may be an innate element of the promoter or a heterologous
10 element inserted to enhance the level or tissue specificity of a promoter. It is capable of
   operating in both orientations (normal or flipped), and is capable of functioning even when
   moved either upstream or downstream from the promoter. Both enhancers and other
   upstream promoter elements bind sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that mediate
   their effects. Promoters may be derived in their entirety from a native gene, or be composed
15 of different elements, derived from different promoters found in nature, or even be comprised
   of synthetic DNA segments. A promoter may also contain DNA sequences that are involved
   in the binding of protein factors, which control the effectiveness of transcription initiation in
   response to physiological or developmental conditions. A person skilled in the art is aware of
   methods for rendering a unidirectional to a bidirectional promoter and of methods to use the
20 complement or reverse complement of a promoter sequence for creating a promoter having
   the same promoter specificity as the original sequence. Such methods are for example
   described for constitutive as well          as  inducible promoters    by Xie et al.      (2001)
   "Bidirectionalization of polar promoters in plants" nature biotechnology 19 pages 677 - 679.
   The authors describe that it is sufficient to add a minimal promoter to the 5' prime end of any
25 given promoter to receive a promoter controlling expression in both directions with same
   promoter specificity.
   The "initiation site" is the position surrounding the first nucleotide that is part of the
   transcribed sequence, which is also defined as position +1. With respect to this site all other
30 sequences of the gene and its controlling regions are numbered. Downstream sequences
   (i.e., further protein encoding sequences in the 3' direction) are denominated positive, while
   upstream sequences (mostly of the controlling regions in the 5' direction) are denominated
   negative.
35 Promoter elements, particularly a TATA element, that are inactive or that have greatly
   reduced promoter activity in the absence of upstream activation are referred to as "minimal
   or core promoters." In the presence of a suitable transcription factor, the minimal promoter
   functions to permit transcription. A "minimal or core promoter" thus consists only of all basal
   elements needed for transcription initiation, e.g., a TATA box and/or an initiator.

                                                     13
   "Constitutive expression" refers to expression using a constitutive or regulated promoter.
   "Conditional" and "regulated expression" refer to expression controlled by a regulated
   promoter.
 5 "Constitutive promoter" refers to a promoter that is able to express the open reading frame
   (ORF) that it controls in all or nearly all of the plant tissues during all or nearly all
   developmental stages of the plant. Each of the transcription-activating elements do not
   exhibit an absolute tissue-specificity, but mediate transcriptional activation in most plant
   parts at a level of at least 1% of the level reached in the part of the plant in which
10 transcription is most active.
   "Regulated promoter" refers to promoters that direct gene expression not constitutively, but
   in a temporally- and/or spatially-regulated manner, and includes both tissue-specific and
   inducible promoters. It includes natural and synthetic molecules as well as molecules which
15 may be a combination of synthetic and natural molecules. Different promoters may direct the
   expression of a gene in different tissues or cell types, or at different stages of development,
   or in response to different environmental conditions. New promoters of various types useful
   in plant cells are constantly being discovered, numerous examples may be found in the
   compilation by Okamuro et al. (1989). Typical regulated promoters useful in plants include
20 but are not limited to safener-inducible promoters, promoters derived from the tetracycline
   inducible system, promoters derived from salicylate-inducible systems, promoters derived
   from alcohol-inducible systems, promoters derived from glucocorticoid-inducible system,
   promoters derived from pathogen-inducible systems, and promoters derived from ecdysone
   inducible systems.
25
   "Tissue-specific promoter" refers to regulated promoters that are not expressed in all plant
   cells but only in one or more cell types in specific organs (such as leaves or seeds), specific
   tissues (such as epidermis, green tissue, embryo or cotyledon), or specific cell types (such
   as leaf parenchyma or seed storage cells). These also include promoters that are temporally
30 regulated, such as in early or late embryogenesis, during leaf expansion fruit ripening in
   developing seeds or fruit, in fully differentiated leaf, or at the onset of senescence.
   "Inducible promoter" refers to those regulated promoters that can be turned on in one or
   more cell types or that cause increased expression upon an external stimulus, such as a
35 chemical, light, hormone, stress, or a pathogen.
   "Operably-linked" or "functionally linked" refers preferably to the association of nucleic acid
   molecules on single nucleic acid fragment so that the function of one is affected by the other.
   For example, a regulatory DNA molecule is said to be "operably linked to" or "associated
40 with" a DNA molecule that codes for an RNA or a polypeptide if the two molecules are
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                   14
   situated such that the regulatory DNA molecule affects expression of the coding DNA
   molecule (i.e., that the coding sequence or functional RNA is under the transcriptional
   control of the promoter). Coding sequences can be operably-linked to regulatory molecules
   in sense or antisense orientation.
 5
   "Expression" refers to the transcription and/or translation of an endogenous gene, ORF or
   portion thereof, or a transgene in plants. For example, in the case of antisense constructs,
   expression may refer to the transcription of the antisense DNA only. In addition, expression
   refers to the transcription and stable accumulation of sense (mRNA) or functional RNA.
10 Expression may also refer to the production of protein.
   "Specific expression" is the expression of gene products, which is limited to one or a few
   plant tissues (spatial limitation) and/or to one or a few plant developmental stages (temporal
   limitation). It is acknowledged that hardly a true specificity exists: promoters seem to be
15 preferably switch on in some tissues, while in other tissues there can be no or only little
   activity. This phenomenon is known as leaky expression. However, with specific expression
   in this invention is meant preferable expression in one or a few plant tissues.
   The "expression pattern" of a promoter (with or without enhancer) is the pattern of
20 expression levels, which shows where in the plant and in what developmental stage
   transcription is initiated by said promoter. Expression patterns of a set of promoters are said
   to be complementary when the expression pattern of one promoter shows little overlap with
   the expression pattern of the other promoter. The level of expression of a promoter can be
   determined by measuring the 'steady state' concentration of a standard transcribed reporter
25 mRNA. This measurement is indirect since the concentration of the reporter mRNA is
   dependent not only on its synthesis rate, but also on the rate with which the mRNA is
   degraded. Therefore, the steady state level is the product of synthesis rates and degradation
   rates. The rate of degradation can however be considered to proceed at a fixed rate when
   the transcribed molecules are identical, and thus this value can serve as a measure of
30 synthesis rates. When promoters are compared in this way techniques available to those
   skilled in the art are hybridization S1-RNAse analysis, northern blots and competitive RT
   PCR. This list of techniques in no way represents all available techniques, but rather
   describes commonly used procedures used to analyze transcription activity and expression
   levels of mRNA. The analysis of transcription start points in practically all promoters has
35 revealed that there is usually no single base at which transcription starts, but rather a more
   or less clustered set of initiation sites, each of which accounts for some start points of the
   mRNA. Since this distribution varies from promoter to promoter the sequences of the
   reporter mRNA in each of the populations would differ from each other. Since each mRNA
   species is more or less prone to degradation, no single degradation rate can be expected for
40 different reporter mRNAs. It has been shown for various eukaryotic promoter molecules that
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                    15
   the sequence surrounding the initiation site ('initiator') plays an important role in determining
   the level of RNA expression directed by that specific promoter. This includes also part of the
   transcribed sequences. The direct fusion of promoter to reporter molecules would therefore
   lead to suboptimal levels of transcription. A commonly used procedure to analyze
 5 expression patterns and levels is through determination of the 'steady state' level of protein
   accumulation in a cell. Commonly used candidates for the reporter gene, known to those
   skilled in the art are beta-glucuronidase (GUS), chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT)
   and proteins with fluorescent properties, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) from
   Aequora victoria. In principle, however, many more proteins are suitable for this purpose,
10 provided the protein does not interfere with essential plant functions. For quantification and
   determination of localization a number of tools are suited. Detection systems can readily be
   created or are available which are based on, e.g., immunochemical, enzymatic, fluorescent
   detection and quantification. Protein levels can be determined in plant tissue extracts or in
   intact tissue using in situ analysis of protein expression. Generally, individual transformed
15 lines with one chimeric promoter reporter construct will vary in their levels of expression of
   the reporter gene. Also frequently observed is the phenomenon that such transformants do
   not express any detectable product (RNA or protein). The variability in expression is
   commonly ascribed to 'position effects', although the molecular mechanisms underlying this
   inactivity are usually not clear.
20
   "Overexpression" refers to the level of expression in transgenic cells or organisms that
   exceeds levels of expression in normal or untransformed (non-transgenic) cells or
   organisms.
25 "Antisense inhibition" refers to the production of antisense RNA transcripts capable of
   suppressing the expression of protein from an endogenous gene or a transgene.
   "Gene silencing" refers to homology-dependent suppression of viral genes, transgenes, or
   endogenous nuclear genes. Gene silencing may be transcriptional, when the suppression is
30 due to decreased transcription of the affected genes, or post-transcriptional, when the
   suppression is due to increased turnover (degradation) of RNA species homologous to the
   affected genes (English 1996). Gene silencing includes virus-induced gene silencing (Ruiz
   et al. 1998).
35 The terms "heterologous DNA molecule", "exogenous DNA segment" or "heterologous
   nucleic acid," as used herein, each refer to a molecule that originates from a source foreign
   to the particular host cell or, if from the same source, is modified from its original form. Thus,
   a heterologous gene in a host cell includes a gene that is endogenous to the particular host
   cell but has been modified through, for example, the use of DNA shuffling. The terms also
40 include non-naturally occurring multiple copies of a naturally occurring DNA molecule. Thus,
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                     16
   the terms refer to a DNA segment that is foreign or heterologous to the cell, or homologous
   to the cell but in a position within the host cell nucleic acid in which the element is not
   ordinarily found. Exogenous DNA segments are expressed to yield exogenous polypeptides.
   A "homologous" DNA molecule is a DNA molecule that is naturally associated with a host
 5 cell into which it is introduced.
   "Homologous to" in the context of nucleotide sequence identity refers to the similarity
   between the nucleotide sequences of two nucleic acid molecules or between the amino acid
   sequences of two protein molecules. Estimates of such homology are provided by either
10 DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization under conditions of stringency as is well understood by
   those skilled in the art (as described in Haines and Higgins (eds.), Nucleic Acid
   Hybridization, IRL Press, Oxford, U.K.), or by the comparison of sequence similarity between
   two nucleic acids or proteins.
15 The term "substantially similar" or "similar" refers to nucleotide and amino acid sequences
   that represent functional and/or structural equivalents or orthologs of Arabidopsis thaliana or
   Glycine max sequences disclosed herein.
   In its broadest sense, the term "substantially similar" or "similar" when used herein with
20 respect to a nucleotide sequence means that the nucleotide sequence is part of a gene
   which encodes a polypeptide having substantially the same structure and function as a
   polypeptide encoded by a gene for the reference nucleotide sequence, e.g., the nucleotide
   sequence comprises a promoter from a gene that is the ortholog of the gene corresponding
   to the reference nucleotide sequence, as well as promoter sequences that are structurally
25 related the promoter sequences particularly exemplified herein, i.e., the substantially similar
   promoter sequences hybridize to the complement of the promoter sequences exemplified
   herein under high or very high stringency conditions. For example, altered nucleotide
   sequences, which simply reflect the degeneracy of the genetic code but nonetheless encode
   amino acid sequences that are identical to a particular amino acid sequence are
30 substantially similar to the particular sequences. The term "substantially similar" also
   includes nucleotide sequences wherein the sequence has been modified, for example, to
   optimize expression in particular cells, as well as nucleotide sequences encoding a variant
   polypeptide having one or more amino acid substitutions relative to the (unmodified)
   polypeptide encoded by the reference sequence, which substitution(s) does not alter the
35 activity of the variant polypeptide relative to the unmodified polypeptide.
   In its broadest sense, the term "substantially similar" or "similar" when used herein with
   respect to polypeptide or nucleic acids means that the polypeptide or nucleic acid has
   substantially the same structure and function as the reference polypeptide. In addition,
40 amino acid sequences or nucleic acids that are substantially similar to a particular sequence
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                    17
   are those wherein overall amino acid or nucleic acid identity is at least 90% or greater to the
   instant sequences. Modifications that result in equivalent nucleotide or amino acid
   sequences are well within the routine skill in the art. The percentage of amino acid or nucleic
   acid sequence identity between the substantially similar and the reference polypeptide or
 5 nucleic acid is at least 90% or more, e.g., 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, up
   to at least 99%, wherein the reference polypeptide is an polypeptide encoded by a gene with
   a promoter having any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
    16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39,
   40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63,
10 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87,
   88 or 89, a nucleotide sequence comprising an open reading frame comprised in SEQ ID
   NOs: 220, 222, 224, 226, 228, 230, 232, 234, 236, 238, 240, 242, 244, 246, 248, 250, 252
   or 254, which encodes a polypeptide described by SEQ ID NOs: 221, 223, 225, 227, 229,
   231, 233, 235, 237, 239, 241, 243, 245, 247, 249, 251, 253 or 255. One indication that two
15 polypeptides are substantially similar to each other, besides having substantially the same
   function, is that an agent, e.g., an antibody, which specifically binds to one of the
   polypeptides, also specifically binds to the other.
   Sequence comparisons maybe carried out using a Smith-Waterman sequence alignment
20 algorithm (see e.g., Waterman (1995)). The localS program, version 1.16, is preferably used
   with following parameters: match: 1, mismatch penalty: 0.33, open-gap penalty: 2, extended
   gap penalty: 2.
   Moreover, a nucleotide sequence that is "substantially similar" or "similar" to a reference
25 nucleotide sequence is said to be "equivalent" to the reference nucleotide sequence. The
   skilled artisan recognizes that equivalent nucleotide sequences encompassed by this
   invention can also be defined by their ability to hybridize, under low, moderate and/or
   stringent conditions (e.g., 0.1 X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 650C), with the nucleotide sequences that
   are within the literal scope of the instant claims.
30
   What is meant by "substantially the same activity" or "the same activity" when used in
   reference to a polynucleotide fragment or a homolog is that the fragment or homolog has at
   least 90% or more, e.g., 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, up to at least 99% of
   the expression regulating activity of the full length polynucleotide.
35
   "Target gene" refers to a gene on the replicon that expresses the desired target coding
   sequence, functional RNA, or protein. The target gene is not essential for replicon
   replication. Additionally, target genes may comprise native non-viral genes inserted into a
   non-native organism, or chimeric genes, and will be under the control of suitable regulatory
40 sequences. Thus, the regulatory sequences in the target gene may come from any source,
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                    18
   including the virus. Target genes may include coding sequences that are either heterologous
   or homologous to the genes of a particular plant to be transformed. However, target genes
   do not include native viral genes. Typical target genes include, but are not limited to genes
   encoding a structural protein, a seed storage protein, a protein that conveys herbicide
 5 resistance, and a protein that conveys insect resistance. Proteins encoded by target genes
   are known as "foreign proteins". The expression of a target gene in a plant will typically
   produce an altered plant trait.
   The term "altered plant trait" means any phenotypic or genotypic change in a transgenic
10 plant relative to the wild-type or non-transgenic plant host.
   "Replication gene" refers to a gene encoding a viral replication protein. In addition to the
   ORF of the replication protein, the replication gene may also contain other overlapping or
   non-overlapping ORF(s), as are found in viral sequences in nature. While not essential for
15 replication, these additional ORFs may enhance replication and/or viral DNA accumulation.
   Examples of such additional ORFs are AC3 and AL3 in ACMV and TGMV geminiviruses,
   respectively.
   "Chimeric trans-acting replication gene" refers either to a replication gene in which the
20 coding sequence of a replication protein is under the control of a regulated plant promoter
   other than that in the native viral replication gene, or a modified native viral replication gene,
   for example, in which a site specific sequence(s) is inserted in the 5' transcribed but
   untranslated region. Such chimeric genes also include insertion of the known sites of
   replication protein binding between the promoter and the transcription start site that
25 attenuate transcription of viral replication protein gene.
   "Chromosomally-integrated" refers to the integration of a foreign gene or DNA construct into
   the host DNA by covalent bonds. Where genes are not "chromosomally integrated" they may
   be "transiently expressed." Transient expression of a gene refers to the expression of a
30 gene that is not integrated into the host chromosome but functions independently, either as
   part of an autonomously replicating plasmid or expression cassette, for example, or as part
   of another biological system such as a virus.
   The term "transformation" refers to the transfer of a nucleic acid fragment into the genome of
35 a host cell, resulting in genetically stable inheritance. Host cells containing the transformed
   nucleic acid fragments are referred to as "transgenic" cells, and organisms comprising
   transgenic cells are referred to as "transgenic organisms". Examples of methods of
   transformation of plants and plant cells include Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (De
   Blaere 1987) and particle bombardment technology (US 4,945,050). Whole plants may be
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                          19
   regenerated from transgenic cells by methods well known to the skilled artisan (see, for
   example, Fromm 1990).
   "Transformed," "transgenic," and "recombinant" refer to a host organism such as a
   bacterium or a plant into which a heterologous nucleic acid molecule has been introduced.
 5 The nucleic acid molecule can be stably integrated into the genome generally known in the
   art and are disclosed (Sambrook 1989; Innis 1995; Gelfand 1995; Innis & Gelfand 1999.
   Known methods of PCR include, but are not limited to, methods using paired primers,
   nested primers, single specific primers, degenerate primers, gene-specific primers, vector
   specific primers, partially mismatched primers, and the like. For example, "transformed,"
10 "transformant," and "transgenic" plants or calli have been through the transformation
   process and                  contain a foreign gene integrated into their chromosome. The term
   "untransformed" refers to normal plants that have not been through the transformation
   process.
15 "Transiently transformed" refers to cells in which transgenes and foreign DNA have been
   introduced (for example, by such methods as Agrobacterium-mediated transformation or
   biolistic bombardment), but not selected for stable maintenance.
   "Stably transformed" refers to cells that have been selected and regenerated on a selection
20 media following transformation.
   "Transient expression" refers to expression in cells in which a virus or a transgene is
   introduced by viral infection or by such methods as Agrobacterium-mediated transformation,
   electroporation, or biolistic bombardment, but not selected for its stable maintenance.
25
   "Genetically stable" and "heritable" refer to chromosomally-integrated genetic elements that
   are stably maintained in the plant and stably inherited by progeny through successive
   generations.
30 "Primary transformant" and "TO generation" refer to transgenic plants that are of the same
   genetic generation as the tissue which was initially transformed (i.e., not having gone
   through meiosis and fertilization since transformation).
   "Secondary transformants" and the "T1, T2, T3, etc. generations" refer to transgenic plants
35 derived from primary transformants through one or more meiotic and fertilization cycles.
   They may be derived by self-fertilization of primary or secondary transformants or crosses of
   primary or secondary transformants with other transformed or untransformed plants.
   Wild-type: The term "wild-type", "natural" or "natural origin" means with respect to an
40 organism, polypeptide, or nucleic acid sequence, that said organism is naturally occurring or
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                 20
   available in at least one naturally occurring organism which is not changed, mutated, or
   otherwise manipulated by man.
   The terms "genome" or "genomic DNA" is referring to the heritable genetic information of a
 5 host organism. Said genomic DNA comprises the DNA of the nucleus (also referred to as
   chromosomal DNA) but also the DNA of the plastids (e.g., chloroplasts) and other cellular
   organelles (e.g., mitochondria). Preferably the terms genome or genomic DNA is referring to
   the chromosomal DNA of the nucleus.
10 The term "chromosomal DNA" or "chromosomal DNA-sequence" is to be understood as the
   genomic DNA of the cellular nucleus independent from the cell cycle status. Chromosomal
   DNA might therefore be organized in chromosomes or chromatids, they might be condensed
   or uncoiled. An insertion into the chromosomal DNA can be demonstrated and analyzed by
   various methods known in the art like e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis,
15 Southern blot analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and in situ PCR.
   The term "nucleic acid" refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers
   thereof in either single- or double-stranded form, composed of monomers (nucleotides)
   containing a sugar, phosphate and a base, which is either a purine or pyrimidine. Unless
20 specifically limited, the term encompasses nucleic acids containing known analogs of natural
   nucleotides, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are
   metabolized in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides. Unless otherwise
   indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively
   modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary
25 sequences as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon
   substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or
   more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues
   (Batzer 1991; Ohtsuka 1985; Rossolini 1994). A "nucleic acid fragment" is a fraction of a
   given nucleic acid molecule. In higher plants, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the genetic
30 material while ribonucleic acid (RNA) is involved in the transfer of information contained
   within DNA into proteins. The term "nucleotide sequence" refers to a polymer of DNA or
   RNA which can be single- or double-stranded, optionally containing synthetic, non-natural or
   altered nucleotide bases capable of incorporation into DNA or RNA polymers. The terms
   "nucleic acid" or "nucleic acid sequence" may also be used interchangeably with gene,
35 cDNA, DNA and RNA encoded by a gene.
   The invention encompasses isolated or substantially purified nucleic acid or protein
   compositions. In the context of the present invention, an "isolated" or "purified" DNA
   molecule or an "isolated" or "purified" polypeptide is a DNA molecule or polypeptide that, by
40 the hand of man, exists apart from its native environment and is therefore not a product of
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                  21
   nature. An isolated DNA molecule or polypeptide may exist in a purified form or may exist in
   a non-native environment such as, for example, a transgenic host cell. For example, an
   "isolated" or "purified" nucleic acid molecule or protein, or biologically active portion thereof,
   is substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by
 5 recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals
   when chemically synthesized. Preferably, an "isolated" nucleic acid is free of sequences
   (preferably protein encoding sequences) that naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences
   located at the 5' and 3' ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from
   which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated nucleic
10 acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb, or 0.1 kb of
   nucleotide sequences that naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the
   cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. A protein that is substantially free of cellular
   material includes preparations of protein or polypeptide having less than about 30%, 20%,
   10%, 5%, (by dry weight) of contaminating protein. When the protein of the invention, or
15 biologically active portion thereof, is recombinantly produced, preferably culture medium
   represents less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, or 5% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or
   non-protein of interest chemicals. The nucleotide sequences of the invention include both
   the naturally occurring sequences as well as mutant (variant) forms. Such variants will
   continue to possess the desired activity, i.e., either promoter activity or the activity of the
20 product encoded by the open reading frame of the non-variant nucleotide sequence.
   The term "variant" or "homolog" with respect to a sequence (e.g., a polypeptide or nucleic
   acid sequence such as - for example - a transcription regulating nucleotide molecule of the
   invention) is intended to mean substantially similar sequences. For nucleotide sequences
25 comprising an open reading frame, variants include those sequences that, because of the
   degeneracy of the genetic code, encode the identical amino acid sequence of the native
   protein. Naturally occurring allelic variants such as these can be identified with the use of
   well-known molecular biology techniques, as, for example, with polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) and hybridization techniques. Variant nucleotide sequences also include synthetically
30 derived nucleotide sequences, such as those generated, for example, by using site-directed
   mutagenesis and for open reading frames, encode the native protein, as well as those that
   encode a polypeptide having amino acid substitutions relative to the native protein.
   Generally, nucleotide sequence variants of the invention will have at least 40, 50, 60, to
   70%, e.g., preferably 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, to 79%, generally at
35 least 80%, e.g., 81%-84%, at least 85%, e.g., 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%,
   94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, to 98% and 99% nucleotide sequence identity to the native (wild type
   or endogenous) nucleotide sequence.
   "Expression cassette" as used herein means a DNA sequence capable of directing
40 expression of a particular nucleotide sequence in an appropriate host cell, comprising a

   promoter operably linked to a nucleotide sequence of interest, which is - optionally
   operably linked to termination signals and/or other regulatory elements. An expression
   cassette may also comprise sequences required for proper translation of the nucleotide
   sequence. The coding region usually codes for a protein of interest but may also code for a
 5 functional RNA of interest, for example antisense RNA or a nontranslated RNA, in the sense
   or antisense direction. The expression cassette comprising the nucleotide sequence of
   interest may be chimeric, meaning that at least one of its components is heterologous with
   respect to at least one of its other components. The expression cassette may also be one,
   which is naturally occurring but has been obtained in a recombinant form useful for
10 heterologous expression. An expression cassette may be assembled entirely extracellularly
   (e.g., by recombinant cloning techniques). However, an expression cassette may also be
   assembled using in part endogenous components. For example, an expression cassette
   may be obtained by placing (or inserting) a promoter sequence upstream of an endogenous
   sequence, which thereby becomes functionally linked and controlled by said promoter
15 sequences. Likewise, a nucleic acid sequence to be expressed may be placed (or inserted)
   downstream of an endogenous promoter sequence thereby forming an expression cassette.
   The expression of the nucleotide sequence in the expression cassette may be under the
   control of a constitutive promoter or of an inducible promoter, which initiates transcription
   only when the host cell is exposed to some particular external stimulus. In the case of a
20 multicellular organism, the promoter can also be specific to a particular tissue or organ or
   stage of development. In a preferred embodiment, such expression cassettes will comprise
   the transcriptional initiation region of the invention linked to a nucleotide sequence of
   interest. Such an expression cassette is preferably provided with a plurality of restriction
   sites for insertion of the gene of interest to be under the transcriptional regulation of the
25 regulatory regions. The expression cassette may additionally contain selectable marker
   genes. The cassette will include in the 5'-3' direction of transcription, a transcriptional and
   translational initiation region, a DNA sequence of interest, and a transcriptional and
   translational termination region functional in plants. The termination region may be native
   with the transcriptional initiation region, may be native with the DNA sequence of interest, or
30 may be derived from another source. Convenient termination regions are available from the
   Ti-plasmid of A. tumefaciens, such, as the octopine synthase and nopaline synthase
   termination regions and others described below (see also, Guerineau 1991; Proudfoot 1991;
   Sanfacon 1991; Mogen 1990; Munroe 1990; Ballas 1989; Joshi 1987).
35 "Vector" is defined to include, inter alia, any plasmid, cosmid, phage or Agrobacterium binary
   vector in double or single stranded linear or circular form which may or may not be self
   transmissible or mobilizable, and which can transform prokaryotic or eukaryotic host either
   by integration into the cellular genome or exist extrachromosomally (e.g. autonomous
   replicating plasmid with an origin of replication).

                                                      23
   Specifically included are shuttle vectors by which is meant a DNA vehicle capable, naturally
   or by design, of replication in two different host organisms, which may be selected from
   actinomycetes and related species, bacteria and eukaryotic (e.g. higher plant, mammalian,
   yeast or fungal cells).
 5
   Preferably the nucleic acid in the vector is under the control of, and operably linked to, an
   appropriate promoter or other regulatory elements for transcription in a host cell such as a
   microbial, e.g. bacterial, or plant cell. The vector may be a bi-functional expression vector
   which functions in multiple hosts. In the case of genomic DNA, this may contain its own
10 promoter or other regulatory elements and in the case of cDNA this may be under the
   control of an appropriate promoter or other regulatory elements for expression in the host
   cell.
   "Cloning vectors" typically contain one or a small number of restriction endonuclease
15 recognition sites at which foreign DNA sequences can be inserted in a determinable fashion
   without loss of essential biological function of the vector, as well as a marker gene that is
   suitable for use in the identification and selection of cells transformed with the cloning vector.
   Marker genes typically include genes that provide tetracycline resistance, hygromycin
   resistance or ampicillin resistance.
20
   A "transgenic plant" is a plant having one or more plant cells that contain an expression
   vector or recombinant expression construct.
   "Plant tissue" includes differentiated and undifferentiated tissues or plants, including but not
25 limited to roots, stems, shoots, leaves, pollen, seeds, tumor tissue and various forms of cells
   and culture such as single cells, protoplast, embryos, and callus tissue. The plant tissue may
   be in plants or in organ, tissue or cell culture.
   The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two or more
30 nucleic acids or polynucleotides: (a) "reference sequence", (b) "comparison window", (c)
   "sequence identity", (d) "percentage of sequence identity", and (e) "substantial identity".
   (a) As used herein, "reference sequence" is a defined sequence used as a basis for
           sequence comparison. A reference sequence may be a subset or the entirety of a
35         specified sequence; for example, as a segment of a fulllength cDNA or gene sequence
           or isolated nucleic acid sequence capable of regulating expression in plants, preferably
           the complete cDNA or gene sequence or isolated nucleic acid sequence capable of
           regulating expression in plants is the reference sequence.

                                                     24
   (b) As used herein, "comparison window" makes reference to a contiguous and specified
           segment of a polynucleotide sequence, wherein the polynucleotide sequence in the
           comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) compared to the
           reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal
 5         alignment of the two sequences. Generally, the comparison window is at least 20
           contiguous nucleotides in length, and optionally can be 30, 40, 50, 100, or longer. In a
           preferred embodiment the comparison window defining the homology of sequence
           consists of the entire query sequence. Those of skill in the art understand that to avoid a
           high similarity to a reference sequence due to inclusion of gaps in the polynucleotide
10         sequence a gap penalty is typically introduced and is subtracted from the number of
           matches.
           Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Thus, the
           determination of percent identity between any two sequences can be accomplished
15         using a mathematical algorithm. Preferred, non-limiting examples of such mathematical
           algorithms are the algorithm of Myers and Miller, 1988; the local homology algorithm of
           Smith et al. 1981; the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch 1970;
           the search-for-similarity-method of Pearson and Lipman 1988; the algorithm of Karlin
           and Altschul, 1990, modified as in Karlin and Altschul, 1993.
20
           Computer implementations of these mathematical algorithms can be utilized for
           comparison of sequences to determine sequence identity. Such implementations
           include, but are not limited to: CLUSTAL in the PC/Gene program (available from
           Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif.); the ALIGN program (Version 2.0) and GAP,
25         BESTFIT, BLAST, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package,
           Version 8 (available from Genetics Computer Group (GCG), 575 Science Drive,
           Madison, Wis., USA). Alignments using these programs can be performed using the
           default parameters. The CLUSTAL program is well described (Higgins 1988, 1989;
           Corpet 1988; Huang 1992; Pearson 1994). The ALIGN program is based on the
30         algorithm of Myers and Miller, supra. The BLAST programs of Altschul et al., 1990, are
           based on the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul, supra. Multiple aligments (i.e. of more
           than 2 sequences) are preferably performed using the Clustal W algorithm (Thompson
           1994; e.g., in the software VectorNTITM , version 9; Invitrogen Inc.) with the scoring
           matrix BLOSUM62MT2 with the default settings (gap opening penalty 15/19, gap
35         extension penalty 6.66/0.05; gap separation penalty range 8; % identity for alignment
           delay 40; using residue specific gaps and hydrophilic residue gaps).
           Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National
           Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This algorithm
40         involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                     25
           of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued
           threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence.
           T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul 1990). These initial
           neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs
 5         containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each
           sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative
           scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score
           for a pair of matching residues; always >0) and N (penalty score for mismatching
           residues; always <0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate
10         the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when the
           cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value,
           the cumulative score goes to zero or below due to the accumulation of one or more
           negative-scoring residue alignments, or the end of either sequence is reached.
15         In addition to calculating percent sequence identity, the BLAST algorithm also performs
           a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin &
           Altschul (1993). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the
           smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which
           a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For
20         example, a test nucleic acid sequence is considered similar to a reference sequence if
           the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid sequence to the
           reference nucleic acid sequence is less than about 0.1, more preferably less than about
           0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.
25         To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST (in BLAST 2.0)
           can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. 1997. Alternatively, PSI-BLAST (in BLAST
           2.0) can be used to perform an iterated search that detects distant relationships
           between molecules. See Altschul et al., supra. When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST,
           PSI-BLAST, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g. BLASTN for
30         nucleotide sequences, BLASTX for proteins) can be used. The BLASTN program (for
           nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of
           10, a cutoff of 100, M=5, N=-4, and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid
           sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 3, an
           expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff & Henikoff,
35         1989). See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Alignment may also be performed manually by
           inspection.
           For purposes of the present invention, comparison of nucleotide sequences for
           determination of percent sequence identity to the promoter sequences disclosed herein
40         is preferably made using the BlastN program (version 1.4.7 or later) with its default
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                     26
           parameters or any equivalent program. By "equivalent program" is intended any
           sequence comparison program that, for any two sequences in question, generates an
           alignment having identical nucleotide or amino acid residue matches and an identical
           percent sequence identity when compared to the corresponding alignment generated by
 5         the preferred program.
   (c) As used herein, "sequence identity" or "identity" in the context of two nucleic acid or
           polypeptide sequences makes reference to the residues in the two sequences that are
           the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified comparison
10         window. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins it is
           recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative
           amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino
           acid residues with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity) and
           therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. When sequences
15         differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted
           upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences that differ
           by such conservative substitutions are said to have "sequence similarity" or "similarity."
           Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically
           this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch,
20         thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an
           identical amino acid is given a score of 1 and a non-conservative substitution is given a
           score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The
           scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., as implemented in the program
           PC/GENE (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif.).
25
   (d) As used herein, "percentage of sequence identity" means the value determined by
           comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, preferably the
           complete query or reference sequence as defined by SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
           9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31,
30         32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54,
           55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77,
           78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88 or 89, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide
           sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as
           compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions)
35         for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by
           determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino
           acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions,
           dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window
           of comparison, and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence
40         identity.

                                                              27
   (e) (i) The term                   "substantial identity" of polynucleotide sequences means that a
           polynucleotide comprises a sequence that has at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, or 94%,
           and most preferably at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity,
 5         compared to a reference sequence using one of the alignment programs described
           using standard parameters. One of skill in the art will recognize that these values can be
           appropriately adjusted to determine corresponding identity of proteins encoded by two
           nucleotide sequences by taking into account codon degeneracy, amino acid similarity,
           reading frame positioning, and the like. Substantial identity of amino acid sequences for
10         these purposes normally means sequence identity of at least 90%, 95%, and most
           preferably at least 98%.
           Another indication that nucleotide sequences are substantially identical is if two
           molecules hybridize to each other under stringent conditions (see below). Generally,
15         stringent conditions are selected to be about 50C lower than the thermal melting point
           (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. However, stringent
           conditions encompass temperatures in the range of about 10C to about 200C,
           depending upon the desired degree of stringency as otherwise qualified herein. Nucleic
           acids that do not hybridize to each other under stringent conditions are still substantially
20         identical if the polypeptides they encode are substantially identical. This may occur, e.g.,
           when a copy of a nucleic acid is created using the maximum codon degeneracy
           permitted by the genetic code. One indication that two nucleic acid sequences are
           substantially identical is when the polypeptide encoded by the first nucleic acid is
           immunologically cross reactive with the polypeptide encoded by the second nucleic
25         acid.
           (ii) The term "substantial identity" in the context of a peptide indicates that a peptide
           comprises a sequence with at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, or 94%, or even more
           preferably, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%, sequence identity to the reference sequence
30         over a specified comparison window. Preferably, optimal alignment is conducted using
           the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970). An indication that
           two peptide sequences are substantially identical is that one peptide is immunologically
           reactive with antibodies raised against the second peptide. Thus, a peptide is
           substantially identical to a second peptide, for example, where the two peptides differ
35         only by a conservative substitution.
   For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to which
   test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and
   reference sequences are input into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated if
40 necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                  28
   comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s)
   relative to the reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters. The
   reference sequences of the invention are defined by the sequences comprised in the
   sequence protocol, preferably SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

25 As noted above, another indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially
   identical is that the two molecules hybridize to each other under stringent conditions. The
   phrase "hybridizing specifically to" refers to the binding, duplexing, or hybridizing of a
   molecule only to a particular nucleotide sequence under stringent conditions when that
   sequence is present in a complex mixture (e.g., total cellular) DNA or RNA. "Bind(s)
30 substantially" refers to complementary hybridization between a probe nucleic acid and a
   target nucleic acid and embraces minor mismatches that can be accommodated by reducing
   the stringency of the hybridization media to achieve the desired detection of the target
   nucleic acid sequence.
35 "Stringent hybridization conditions" and "stringent hybridization wash conditions" in the
   context of nucleic acid hybridization experiments such as Southern and Northern
   hybridization are sequence dependent, and are different under different environmental
   parameters. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50%
   of the target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. Specificity is typically the
40 function of post-hybridization washes, the critical factors being the ionic strength and
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                   29
   temperature of the final wash solution. For DNA-DNA hybrids, the Tm can be approximated
   from the equation of Meinkoth and Wahl, 1984:
   Tm = 81.50C + 16.6 logoo M)+0.41 (%GC) - 0.61 (% form) - 500 / L
 5
   where M is the molarity of monovalent cations, %GC is the percentage of guanosine and
   cytosine nucleotides in the DNA, % form is the percentage of formamide in the hybridization
   solution, and L is the length of the hybrid in base pairs. Tm is reduced by about 1 C for each
    1% of mismatching; thus, Tm, hybridization, and/or wash conditions can be adjusted to
10 hybridize to sequences of the desired identity. For example, if sequences with >90% identity
   are sought, the Tm can be decreased 100C. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to
   be about 50C lower than the thermal melting point I for the specific sequence and its
   complement at a defined ionic strength and pH. However, severely stringent conditions can
   utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 C lower than the thermal
15 melting point I; moderately stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 6,
   7, 8, 9, or 10 C lower than the thermal melting point I; low stringency conditions can utilize a
   hybridization and/or wash at 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 200C lower than the thermal melting point
   1. Using the equation, hybridization and wash compositions, and desired T, those of ordinary
   skill will understand that variations in the stringency of hybridization and/or wash solutions
20 are inherently described. If the desired degree of mismatching results in a T of less than
   450C (aqueous solution) or 320C (formamide solution), it is preferred to increase the SSC
   concentration so that a higher temperature can be used. An extensive guide to the
   hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, 1993. Generally, highly stringent
   hybridization and wash conditions are selected to be about 50C lower than the thermal
25 melting point Tm for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH.
   An example of highly stringent wash conditions is 0.15 M NaCl at 720C for about 15 minutes.
   An example of stringent wash conditions is a 0.2 X SSC wash at 650C for 15 minutes (see,
   Sambrook, infra, for a description of SSC buffer). Often, a high stringency wash is preceded
30 by a low stringency wash to remove background probe signal. An example medium
   stringency wash for a duplex of, e.g., more than 100 nucleotides, is 1 X SSC at 450C for 15
   minutes. An example low stringency wash for a duplex of, e.g., more than 100 nucleotides,
   is 4 to 6 X SSC at 400C for 15 minutes. For short probes (e.g., about 10 to 50 nucleotides),
   stringent conditions typically involve salt concentrations of less than about 1.5 M, more
35 preferably about 0.01 to 1.0 M, Na ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3, and the
   temperature is typically at least about 300C and at least about 600C for long robes (e.g., >50
   nucleotides). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing
   agents such as formamide. In general, a signal to noise ratio of 2 X (or higher) than that
   observed for an unrelated probe in the particular hybridization assay indicates detection of a
40 specific hybridization. Nucleic acids that do not hybridize to each other under stringent
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                    30
   conditions are still substantially identical if the proteins that they encode are substantially
   identical. This occurs, e.g., when a copy of a nucleic acid is created using the maximum
   codon degeneracy permitted by the genetic code.
 5 Very stringent conditions are selected to be equal to the Tm for a particular probe. An
   example of stringent conditions for hybridization of complementary nucleic acids which have
   more than 100 complementary residues on a filter in a Southern or Northern blot is 50%
   formamide, e.g., hybridization in 50% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 370C, and a wash in
   0.1 x SSC at 60 to 650C. Exemplary low stringency conditions include hybridization with a
10 buffer solution of 30 to 35% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate) at
   370C, and a wash in 1 X to 2 X SSC (20 X SSC=3.0 M NaClI/0.3 M trisodium citrate) at 50 to
   550C. Exemplary moderate stringency conditions include hybridization in 40 to 45%
   formamide, 1.0 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 370C, and a wash in 0.5 X to 1 X SSC at 55 to 600C.
15 The following are examples of sets of hybridization/wash conditions that may be used to
   clone orthologous nucleotide sequences that are substantially identical to reference
   nucleotide sequences of the present invention: a reference nucleotide sequence preferably
   hybridizes to the reference nucleotide sequence in 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5 M
   NaPO 4 , 1 mM EDTA at 500C with washing in 2 X SSC, 0. 1% SDS at 500C, more desirably
20 in 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5 M NaPO 4 , 1 mM EDTA at 500C with washing in 1 X
   SSC, 0.1% SDS at 500C, more desirably still in 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5 M
   NaPO 4 , 1 mM EDTA at 500C with washing in 0.5 X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 500C, preferably in
   7% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5 M NaPO 4, 1 mM EDTA at 500C with washing in 0.1 X

25 NaPO 4 , 1 mM EDTA at 500C with washing in 0.1 X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 650C.

   in a DNA molecule or to generate exchanges of DNA sequences between two or more DNA
   molecules, preferably randomly. The DNA molecule resulting from DNA shuffling is a

   one template DNA molecule. The shuffled DNA preferably encodes a variant polypeptide
   modified with respect to the polypeptide encoded by the template DNA, and may have an
   altered biological activity with respect to the polypeptide encoded by the template DNA.

   using recombinant DNA technology and procedures used to join together DNA sequences
   as described, for example, in Sambrook et al., 1989.

   Preferably, such homolog or fragment of the transcription regulating nucleotide molecule to
   be employed in the expression cassette of the invention (e.g., the sequences specified
   under ii), iii), iv) v), vi) and vii) above) is capable to modify transcription in a plant cell or
40 organism, more preferably said homolog or fragment (e.g., the sequences specified under
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

    10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. Preferably, the homolog or fragment (e.g., the
   sequences specified under iii) above) has a sequence identity of at least 60% or 65%,
 5 preferably at least 70%, 75% or 80%, more preferably at least 90% or 95%, most preferably
   at least 97%, 98% or 99% to a sequence described by SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
   10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. Preferably, the homologs or fragments (e.g., the
   sequences specified under iv) or vi) above) are hybridizing under stringent conditions (i.e.
   preferably medium stringent, more preferably high stringent conditions) with the specified
10 target sequence.
   In the applications US 61/419895 and EP 10193800.9 methods for the production of such
   homologs having the same expression pattern as the reference sequence as defined by
   SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 are described.
15
   The homologs or fragments of the transcription regulating nucleotide molecule of the
   invention (e.g., the sequence described by any of SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
   11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18) may be obtained or is obtainable from plant genomic DNA
   from a gene which is encoding an amino acid sequence having at least 90% amino acid
20 sequence identity, more preferably at least 90% or 95%, most preferably at least 97% or
   98% amino acid sequence identity, to a polypeptide as described by SEQ ID NO: 221, 223,
   225, 227, 229, 231, 233, 235, 237, 239, 241, 243, 245, 247, 249, 251, 253 and 255.
   The activity of a transcription regulating nucleotide molecule is considered equivalent if
25 transcription is initiated in the same tissues as is by the reference molecule. Such
   expression profile is preferably demonstrated using reporter genes operably linked to said
   transcription regulating nucleotide sequence. Preferred reporter genes (Schenborn 1999) in
   this context are green fluorescence protein (GFP) (Chui 1996; Leffel 1997), chloramphenicol
   transferase, luciferase (Millar 1992), beta -glucuronidase or beta-galactosidase. Especially
30 preferred is beta -glucuronidase (Jefferson 1987).
   Beside this the transcription regulating activity of a functional equivalent homolog or
   fragment of the transcription regulating nucleotide molecule may vary from the activity of its
   parent sequence, especially with respect to expression level. The expression level may be
35 higher or lower than the expression level of the parent sequence. Both derivations may be
   advantageous depending on the nucleic acid sequence of interest to be expressed.
   Preferred are such functional equivalent sequences, which - in comparison with its parent
   sequence - does, not derivate from the expression level of said parent sequence by more
   than 50%, preferably 25%, more preferably 10% (as to be preferably judged by either mRNA
40 expression or protein (e.g., reporter gene) expression). Furthermore preferred are equivalent
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                  38
   sequences which demonstrate an increased expression in comparison to its parent
   sequence, preferably an increase by at least 50%, more preferably by at least 100%, most
   preferably by at least 500%.
 5 Preferably a functional equivalent of the transcription regulating nucleotide molecule of the
   invention can be obtained or is obtainable from plant genomic DNA from a gene expressing
   a mRNA described by a cDNA comprising a sequence which is substantially similar and
   preferably has at least 90%, preferably at least 92% or 95%, more preferably at least 96% or
   97%, most preferably at least 99% sequence identity to a sequence described by any SEQ
10 ID NOs: 220, 222, 224, 226, 228, 230, 232, 234, 236, 238, 240, 242, 244, 246, 248, 250,
   252 and 254. Preferably said transcription regulating nucleotide molecule exhibits promoter
   activity in the same tissue/s as the reference molecule as defined by SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, 3, 4,
   5, 6,7,8, 9, 10, 11, 12,13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18.
15 Such functional equivalent of the transcription regulating nucleotide molecule may be
   obtained from other plant species by using the Arabidopsis thaliana, or Glycine max
   promoter sequences described herein as probes to screen for homologous structural genes
   in other plants by hybridization under low, moderate or stringent hybridization conditions.
   Regions of the promoter sequences of the present invention which are conserved among
20 species could also be used as PCR primers to amplify a segment from a species other than
   Arabidopsis thaliana, or Glycine max, and that segment used as a hybridization probe (the
   latter approach permitting higher stringency screening) or in a transcription assay to
   determine promoter activity. Moreover, the promoter sequences could be employed to
   identify structurally related sequences in a database using computer algorithms.
25
   More specifically, based on the nucleic acid sequences of the present invention, orthologs
   may be identified or isolated from the genome of any desired organism, preferably from
   another plant, according to well known techniques based on their sequence similarity to the
   Arabidopsis thaliana, or Glycine max nucleic acid sequences, e.g., hybridization, PCR or
30 computer generated sequence comparisons. For example, all or a portion of a particular
   Arabidopsis thaliana, or Glycine max nucleic acid sequence is used as a probe that
   selectively hybridizes to other gene sequences present in a population of cloned genomic
   DNA fragments or cDNA fragments (i.e., genomic or cDNA libraries) from a chosen source
   organism. Further, suitable genomic and cDNA libraries may be prepared from any cell or
35 tissue of an organism. Such techniques include hybridization screening of plated DNA
   libraries (either plaques or colonies; see, e.g., Sambrook 1989) and amplification by PCR
   using oligonucleotide primers preferably corresponding to sequence domains conserved
   among related polypeptide or subsequences of the nucleotide sequences provided herein
   (see, e.g., Innis 1990). These methods are particularly well suited to the isolation of gene
40 sequences from organisms closely related to the organism from which the probe sequence
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                   39
   is derived. The application of these methods using the Arabidopsis thaliana, or Glycine max
   sequences as probes is well suited for the isolation of gene sequences from any source
   organism, preferably other plant species. In a PCR approach, oligonucleotide primers can be
   designed for use in PCR reactions to amplify corresponding DNA sequences from cDNA or
 5 genomic DNA extracted from any plant of interest. Methods for designing PCR primers and
   PCR cloning are generally known in the art.
   In hybridization techniques, all or part of a known nucleotide sequence is used as a probe
   that selectively hybridizes to other corresponding nucleotide sequences present in a
10 population of cloned genomic DNA fragments or cDNA fragments (i.e., genomic or cDNA
   libraries) from a chosen organism. The hybridization probes may be genomic DNA
   fragments, cDNA fragments, RNA fragments, or other oligonucleotides, and may be labeled
                                       32
   with a detectable group such as        P, or any other detectable marker. Thus, for example,
   probes for hybridization can be made by labeling synthetic oligonucleotides based on the
15 sequence of the invention. Methods for preparation of probes for hybridization and for
   construction of cDNA and genomic libraries are generally known in the art and are disclosed
   in Sambrook et al. (1989). In general, sequences that hybridize to the sequences disclosed
   herein will have at least about 50% to 70% and even about 80% 85%, 90%, 95% to 98% or
   more identity with the disclosed sequences. That is, the sequence similarity of sequences
20 may range, sharing at least about 50% to 70%, and even about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% to
   98% sequence similarity.
   The nucleic acid molecules of the invention can also be identified by, for example, a search
   of known databases for genes encoding polypeptides having a specified amino acid
25 sequence identity or DNA having a specified nucleotide sequence identity. Methods of
   alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art and are described
   hereinabove.
   Hence, the isolated nucleic acid molecules of the invention include the orthologs of the
30 Arabidopsis thaliana, or Glycine max sequences disclosed herein, i.e., the corresponding
   nucleotide sequences in organisms other than Arabidopsis thaliana, or Glycine max
   including, but not limited to, plants other than Arabidopsis thaliana, or Glycine max,
   preferably dicotyledonous plants, e.g., alfalfa, sunflower, rape seed, cotton, peanut, tobacco,
   or sugar beet, but also cereal plants such as corn, wheat, rye, turfgrass, sorghum, millet,
35 sugarcane, barley and banana. An orthologous gene is a gene from a different species that
   encodes a product having the same or similar function, e.g., catalyzing the same reaction as
   a product encoded by a gene from a reference organism. Thus, an ortholog includes
   polypeptides having less than, e.g., 50% amino acid sequence identity, but which ortholog
   encodes a polypeptide having the same or similar function. Databases such GenBank may
40 be employed to identify sequences related to the Arabidopsis thaliana, or Glycine max
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                        40
   sequences, e.g., orthologs in other dicotyledonous plants. Alternatively, recombinant DNA
   techniques such as hybridization or PCR may be employed to identify sequences related to
   the Arabidopsis thaliana, or Glycine max sequences or to clone the equivalent sequences
   from different DNAs.
 5
   The transcription regulating nucleotide sequences of the invention or their functional
   equivalents can be obtained or isolated from any plant or non-plant source, or produced
   synthetically by purely chemical means. Preferred sources include, but are not limited to the
   plants defined in the DEFINITION section above.
10
   Thus, another preferred embodiment of the invention relates to a method for identifying
   and/or isolating a transcription regulating nucleotide molecule characterized that said
   identification and/or isolation utilizes a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide
   comprising a sequence as described by SEQ ID NO: 221, 223, 225, 227, 229, 231, 233,
15 235, 237, 239, 241, 243, 245, 247, 249, 251, 253 and 255, or a part of said nucleic acid
   sequence. Preferred are nucleic acid molecules comprising nucleic acid sequences
   described by or comprising any of SEQ ID NO: 220, 222, 224, 226, 228, 230, 232, 234, 236,
   238, 240, 242, 244, 246, 248, 250, 252 and 254 or parts thereof. "Part" in this context means
   a nucleic acid sequence of at least 15 consecutive nucleotides, preferably at least 25
20 consecutive nucleotides, more preferably at least 50 consecutive nucleotides.
   The method for identification and/or isolation can be based on (but is not limited to) the
   methods described above such as polymerase chain reaction, hybridization or database
   screening. Preferably, this method of the invention is based on a polymerase chain reaction,
25 wherein said nucleic acid sequence or its part is utilized as oligonucleotide primer. The
   person skilled in the art is aware of several methods to amplify and isolate the promoter of a
   gene starting from part of its coding sequence (such as, for example, part of a cDNA). Such
   methods may include but are not limited to method such as inverse PCR ("iPCR") or
   "thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR" ("TAIL PCR").

   Still another embodiment of the invention relates to a method for providing a transgenic
   expression cassette for expression comprising the steps of:
   1.            isolating of a transcription regulating nucleotide molecule utilizing at least one
 5               nucleic acid molecule or a part thereof, wherein said molecule is encoding a protein
                 comprising any of SEQ ID NO: 221, 223, 225, 227, 229, 231, 233, 235, 237, 239,
                 241, 243, 245, 247, 249, 251, 253 and 255, or a part of at least 15 consecutive
                 nucleotides thereof, and
   II.           functionally linking said transcription regulating nucleotide molecule to another
10               nucleotide molecule of interest, which is heterologous in relation to said transcription
                 regulating nucleotide molecule.
   Preferably, the nucleic acid molecule employed for the isolation comprises at least 15
   consecutive nucleotides, preferably at least 25 consecutive nucleotides, more preferably at
15 least 50 consecutive nucleotides of a nucleic acid molecule comprising a sequence
   described by any of SEQ ID NO: 220, 222, 224, 226, 228, 230, 232, 234, 236, 238, 240,
   242, 244, 246, 248, 250, 252 and 254. Preferably, the isolation of the transcription regulating
   nucleotide molecule is realized by a polymerase chain reaction utilizing said nucleic acid
   sequence as a primer. The operable linkage can be realized by standard cloning method
20 known in the art such as ligation-mediated cloning or recombination-mediated cloning.
   Preferably, the transcription regulating nucleotide sequences and promoters of the invention
   include a consecutive stretch of about 250 consecutive bases, preferably at least 300
   consecutive bases, more preferably at least 400 consecutive bases, even more preferably at
25 least 500 consecutive bases, most preferably at least 750 consecutive bases, of any one of
   SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, or the promoter
   orthologs thereof, which include the minimal promoter region.
   Preferably, the transcription regulating nucleotide sequences and promoters of the invention
30 include a consecutive stretch of about 250 consecutive bases, preferably at least 300
   consecutive bases, more preferably at least 400 consecutive bases, even more preferably at
   least 500 consecutive bases, most preferably at least 750 consecutive bases, of any one of
   SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, or the promoter
   orthologs thereof, which include the minimal promoter region. In a particular embodiment of
35 the invention said consecutive stretch of about 250 consecutive bases, preferably at least
   300 consecutive bases, more preferably at least 400 consecutive bases, even more
   preferably at least 500 consecutive bases, most preferably at least 750 consecutive bases,
   has at least 50% or 60%, preferably at least 70% or 80%, more preferably at least 90% even
   more preferably at least 95% or 97%, most preferably 98% or 99%, nucleic acid sequence
40 identity with a corresponding consecutive stretch of about 250 consecutive bases, preferably
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                  42
   at least 300 consecutive bases, more preferably at least 400 consecutive bases, even more
   preferably at least 500 consecutive bases, most preferably at least 750 consecutive bases,
   of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 or
   the promoter orthologs thereof, which include the minimal promoter region. The above
 5 defined stretch of contiguous nucleotides preferably comprises one or more promoter motifs
   selected from the group consisting of TATA box, GC-box, CAAT-box and a transcription start
   site.
   The transcription regulating nucleotide sequences of the invention or their functional
10 equivalents are capable of driving expression of a coding sequence in a target cell,
   particularly in a plant cell. The promoter sequences and methods disclosed herein are useful
   in regulating expression, respectively, of any heterologous nucleotide sequence in a host
   plant or part thereof in order to vary the phenotype of that plant. These promoters can be
   used with combinations of enhancer, upstream elements, and/or activating sequences from
15 the 5' flanking regions of plant expressible structural genes. Similarly the upstream element
   can be used in combination with various plant promoter sequences.
   The transcription regulating nucleotide sequences and promoters of the invention are useful
   to modify the phenotype of a plant. Various changes in the phenotype of a transgenic plant
20 are desirable, i.e., modifying the fatty acid composition in a plant, altering the amino acid
   content of a plant, altering a plant's pathogen defense mechanism, and the like. These
   results can be achieved by providing expression of heterologous products or increased
   expression of endogenous products in plants. Alternatively, the results can be achieved by
   providing for a reduction of expression of one or more endogenous products, particularly
25 enzymes or cofactors in the plant. These changes result in an alteration in the phenotype of
   the transformed plant.
   Generally, the transcription regulating nucleotide sequences and promoters of the invention
   may be employed to express a nucleic acid segment that is operably linked to said promoter
30 such as, for example, an open reading frame, or a portion thereof, an anti-sense sequence,
   a sequence encoding for a double-stranded RNA sequence, or a transgene in plants.
   An operable linkage may - for example - comprise an sequential arrangement of the
   transcription regulating nucleotide molecule of the invention (for example a sequence as
35 described by SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
   21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44,
   45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68,
   69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88 and 89) with a
   nucleic acid sequence to be expressed, and - optionally - additional regulatory elements
40 such as for example polyadenylation or transcription termination elements, enhancers,
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                      43
   introns etc., in a way that the transcription regulating nucleotide molecule can fulfill its
   function in the process of expressing the nucleic acid sequence of interest under the
   appropriate conditions. The term "appropriate conditions" means preferably the presence of
   the expression cassette in a plant cell. Preferred are arrangements, in which the nucleic acid
 5 sequence of interest to be expressed is placed down-stream (i.e., in 3'-direction) of the
   transcription regulating nucleotide molecule of the invention in a way, that both sequences
   are covalently linked. Optionally additional sequences may be inserted in-between the two
   sequences. Such sequences may be for example linker or multiple cloning sites.
   Furthermore, sequences can be inserted coding for parts of fusion proteins (in case a fusion
10 protein of the protein encoded by the nucleic acid of interest is intended to be expressed).
   Preferably, the distance between the nucleic acid sequence of interest to be expressed and
   the transcription regulating nucleotide molecule of the invention is not more than 200 base
   pairs, preferably not more than 100 base pairs, more preferably no more than 50 base pairs.
15 An operable linkage in relation to any expression cassette or of the invention may be
   realized by various methods known in the art, comprising both in vitro and in vivo procedure.
   Thus, an expression cassette of the invention or an vector comprising such expression
   cassette may by realized using standard recombination and cloning techniques well known
   in the art (see e.g., Maniatis 1989; Silhavy 1984; Ausubel 1987).
20
   An expression cassette may also be assembled by inserting a transcription regulating
   nucleotide molecule of the invention (for example a sequence as described by SEQ ID NO:
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,
   28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51,
25 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75,
   76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88 and 89) into the plant genome. Such
   insertion will result in an operable linkage to a nucleic acid sequence of interest which as
   such already existed in the genome. By the insertion the nucleic acid of interest is expressed
   in a way due to the transcription regulating properties of the transcription regulating
30 nucleotide sequence. The insertion may be directed or by chance. Preferably the insertion is
   directed and realized by for example homologous recombination. By this procedure a natural
   promoter may be exchanged against the transcription regulating nucleotide molecule of the
   invention,            thereby modifying the expression  profile of an endogenous gene. The
   transcription regulating nucleotide molecule may also be inserted in a way, that antisense
35 mRNA of an endogenous gene is expressed, thereby inducing gene silencing.
   Similar, a nucleic acid sequence of interest to be expressed may by inserted into a plant
   genome comprising the transcription regulating nucleotide molecule in its natural genomic
   environment (i.e. linked to its natural gene) in a way that the inserted sequence becomes
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                    44
   operably linked to the transcription regulating nucleotide sequence, thereby forming an
   expression cassette of the invention.
   The expression cassette may be employed for numerous expression purposes such as for
 5 example expression of a protein, or expression of an antisense RNA, sense or double
   stranded RNA. Preferably, expression of the nucleic acid sequence confers to the plant an
   agronomically valuable trait.
   The open reading frame to be linked to the transcription regulating nucleotide molecule of
10 the invention may be obtained from an insect resistance gene, a disease resistance gene
   such as, for example, a bacterial disease resistance gene, a fungal disease resistance gene,
   a viral disease resistance gene, a nematode disease resistance gene, a herbicide resistance
   gene, a gene affecting grain composition or quality, a nutrient utilization gene, a mycotoxin
   reduction gene, a male sterility gene, a selectable marker gene, a screenable marker gene,
15 a negative selectable marker, a positive selectable marker, a gene affecting plant agronomic
   characteristics, i.e., yield, standability, and the like, or an environment or stress resistance
   gene, i.e., one or more genes that confer herbicide resistance or tolerance, insect resistance
   or tolerance, disease resistance or tolerance (viral, bacterial, fungal, oomycete, or
   nematode), stress tolerance or resistance (as exemplified by resistance or tolerance to
20 drought, heat, chilling, freezing, excessive moisture, salt stress, or oxidative stress),
   increased yields, food content and makeup, physical appearance, male sterility, drydown,
   standability, prolificacy, starch properties or quantity, oil quantity and quality, amino acid or
   protein composition, and the like. By "resistant" is meant a plant, which exhibits substantially
   no phenotypic changes as a consequence of agent administration, infection with a pathogen,
25 or exposure to stress. By "tolerant" is meant a plant, which, although it may exhibit some
   phenotypic changes as a consequence of infection, does not have a substantially decreased
   reproductive capacity or substantially altered metabolism.
   The expression regulating nucleotide sequences specified above may be optionally operably
30 linked to other suitable regulatory sequences, e.g., a transcription terminator sequence,
   operator, repressor-binding site, transcription factor binding site and/or an enhancer.
   The present invention further provides a recombinant vector containing the expression
   cassette of the invention, and host cells comprising the expression cassette or vector, e.g.,
35 comprising a plasmid. The expression cassette or vector may augment the genome of a
   transformed plant or may be maintained extra-chromosomally. The expression cassette or
   vector of the invention may be present in the nucleus, chloroplast, mitochondria and/or
   plastid of the cells of the plant. Preferably, the expression cassette or vector of the invention
   is comprised in the chromosomal DNA of the plant nucleus. The present invention also
40 provides a transgenic plant prepared by this method, a seed from such a plant and progeny
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                    45
   plants from such a plant including hybrids and inbreds. The expression cassette may be
   operatively linked to a structural gene, the open reading frame thereof, or a portion thereof.
   The expression cassette may further comprise a Ti plasmid and be contained in an
   Agrobacterium tumefaciens cell; it may be carried on a microparticle, wherein the
 5 microparticle is suitable for ballistic transformation of a plant cell; or it may be contained in a
   plant cell or protoplast. Further, the expression cassette or vector can be contained in a
   transformed plant or cells thereof, and the plant may be a dicot or a monocot. In particular,
   the plant may be a dicotyledonous plant. Preferred transgenic plants are transgenic maize,
   soybean, barley, alfalfa, sunflower, canola, soybean, cotton, peanut, sorghum, tobacco,
10 sugarbeet, rice, wheat, rye, turfgrass, millet, sugarcane, tomato, or potato.
   The invention also provides a method of plant breeding, e.g., to prepare a crossed fertile
   transgenic plant. The method comprises crossing a fertile transgenic plant comprising a
   particular expression cassette of the invention with itself or with a second plant, e.g., one
15 lacking the particular expression cassette, to prepare the seed of a crossed fertile transgenic
   plant comprising the particular expression cassette. The seed is then planted to obtain a
   crossed fertile transgenic plant. The plant may be a monocot or a dicot. In a particular
   embodiment, the plant is a dicotyledonous plant. The crossed fertile transgenic plant may
   have the particular expression cassette inherited through a female parent or through a male
20 parent. The second plant may be an inbred plant. The crossed fertile transgenic may be a
   hybrid. Also included within the present invention are seeds of any of these crossed fertile
   transgenic plants.
   The transcription regulating nucleotide sequences of the invention further comprise
25 sequences which are complementary to one (hereinafter "test" sequence) which hybridizes
   under stringent conditions with a nucleic acid molecule as described by SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, 3,
   4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,
   30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53,
   54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77,
30 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88 and 89, as well as RNA which is transcribed from
   the nucleic acid molecule. When the hybridization is performed under stringent conditions,
   either the test or nucleic acid molecule of invention is preferably supported, e.g., on a
   membrane or DNA chip. Thus, either a denatured test or nucleic acid molecule of the
   invention is preferably first bound to a support and hybridization is effected for a specified
35 period of time at a temperature of, e.g., between 55 and 700C, in double strength citrate
   buffered saline (SC) containing 0.1% SDS followed by rinsing of the support at the same
   temperature but with a buffer having a reduced SC concentration. Depending upon the
   degree of stringency required such reduced concentration buffers are typically single
   strength SC containing 0.1% SDS, half strength SC containing 0.1% SDS and one-tenth
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                    46
   strength SC containing 0.1% SDS. More preferably hybridization is carried out under high
   stringency conditions (as defined above).
   Virtually any DNA composition may be used for delivery to recipient plant cells, e.g.,
 5 dicotyledonous cells, to ultimately produce fertile transgenic plants in accordance with the
   present invention. For example, DNA segments or fragments in the form of vectors and
   plasmids, or linear DNA segments or fragments, in some instances containing only the DNA
   element to be expressed in the plant, and the like, may be employed. The construction of
   vectors, which may be employed in conjunction with the present invention, will be known to
10 those of skill of the art in light of the present disclosure (see, e.g., Sambrook 1989; Gelvin
   1990).
   The nucleotide sequence of interest linked to one or more of the transcription regulating
   nucleotide sequences of the invention can, for example, code for a ribosomal RNA, an
15 antisense RNA or any other type of RNA that is not translated into protein. In another
   preferred embodiment of the invention, said nucleotide sequence of interest is translated into
   a protein product. The transcription regulating nucleotide molecule and/or nucleotide
   sequence of interest linked thereto may be of homologous or heterologous origin with
   respect to the plant to be transformed. A recombinant DNA molecule useful for introduction
20 into plant cells includes that which has been derived or isolated from any source, that may
   be subsequently characterized as to structure, size and/or function, chemically altered, and
   later introduced into plants. An example of a nucleotide sequence or segment of interest
   "derived" from a source, would be a nucleotide sequence or segment that is identified as a
   useful fragment within a given organism, and which is then chemically synthesized in
25 essentially pure form. An example of such a nucleotide sequence or segment of interest
   "isolated" from a source, would be nucleotide sequence or segment that is excised or
   removed from said source by chemical means, e.g., by the use of restriction endonucleases,
   so that it can be further manipulated, e.g., amplified, for use in the invention, by the
   methodology of genetic engineering. Such a nucleotide sequence or segment is commonly
30 referred to as "recombinant."
   Therefore a useful nucleotide sequence, segment or fragment of interest includes
   completely synthetic DNA, semi-synthetic DNA, DNA isolated from biological sources, and
   DNA derived from introduced RNA. Generally, the introduced DNA is not originally resident
35 in the plant genotype which is the recipient of the DNA, but it is within the scope of the
   invention to isolate a gene from a given plant genotype, and to subsequently introduce
   multiple copies of the gene into the same genotype, e.g., to enhance production of a given
   gene product such as a storage protein or a protein that confers tolerance or resistance to
   water deficit.
40
   104432811 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                  47
   The introduced recombinant DNA molecule includes but is not limited to, DNA from plant
   genes, and non-plant genes such as those from bacteria, yeasts, animals or viruses. The
   introduced DNA can include modified genes, portions of genes, or chimeric genes, including
   genes from the same or different genotype. The term "chimeric gene" or "chimeric DNA" is
 5 defined as a gene or DNA sequence or segment comprising at least two DNA sequences or
   segments from species which do not combine DNA under natural conditions, or which DNA
   sequences or segments are positioned or linked in a manner which does not normally occur
   in the native genome of untransformed plant.
10 The introduced recombinant DNA molecule used for transformation herein may be circular or
   linear, double-stranded or single-stranded. Generally, the DNA is in the form of chimeric
   DNA, such as plasmid DNA that can also contain coding regions flanked by regulatory
   sequences, which promote the expression of the recombinant DNA present in the resultant
   plant. Generally, the introduced recombinant DNA molecule will be relatively small, i.e., less
15 than about 30 kb to minimize any susceptibility to physical, chemical, or enzymatic
   degradation which is known to increase as the size of the nucleotide molecule increases. As
   noted above, the number of proteins, RNA transcripts or mixtures thereof, which is
   introduced into the plant genome, is preferably preselected and defined, e.g., from one to
   about 5-10 such products of the introduced DNA may be formed.
20
   Two principal methods for the control of expression are known, viz.: overexpression and
   underexpression. Overexpression can be achieved by insertion of one or more than one
   extra copy of the selected gene. It is, however, not unknown for plants or their progeny,
   originally transformed with one or more than one extra copy of a nucleotide sequence, to
25 exhibit the effects of underexpression as well as overexpression. For underexpression there
   are two principle methods, which are commonly referred to in the art as "antisense
   downregulation" and "sense downregulation" (sense downregulation is also referred to as
   "cosuppression"). Generically these processes are referred to as "gene silencing". Both of
   these methods lead to an inhibition of expression of the target gene.
30
   Obtaining sufficient levels of transgene expression in the appropriate plant tissues is an
   important aspect in the production of genetically engineered crops. Expression                of
   heterologous DNA sequences in a plant host is dependent upon the presence of an
   operably linked promoter that is functional within the plant host. Choice of the promoter
35 sequence will determine when and where within the organism the heterologous DNA
   sequence is expressed.
   It is specifically contemplated by the inventors that one could mutagenize a promoter to
   potentially improve the utility of the elements for the expression of transgenes in plants. The
40 mutagenesis of these elements can be carried out at random and the mutagenized promoter
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                         48
   sequences screened for activity in a trial-by-error procedure. Alternatively, particular
   sequences which provide the promoter with desirable expression characteristics, or the
   promoter with expression enhancement activity, could be identified and these or similar
   sequences introduced into the sequences via mutation. It is further contemplated that one
 5 could mutagenize these sequences in order to enhance their expression of transgenes in a
   particular species.
   The means for mutagenizing a DNA segment encoding a promoter sequence of the current
   invention are well known to those of skill in the art. As indicated, modifications to promoter or
10 other regulatory element may be made by random, or site-specific mutagenesis procedures.
   The promoter and other regulatory element may be modified by altering their structure
   through the addition or deletion of one or more nucleotides from the sequence which
   encodes the corresponding unmodified sequences.
15 Mutagenesis may be performed in accordance with any of the techniques known in the art,
   such as, and not limited to, synthesizing an oligonucleotide having one or more mutations
   within the sequence of a particular regulatory region. In particular, site-specific mutagenesis
   is a technique useful in the preparation of promoter mutants, through specific mutagenesis
   of the underlying DNA. The technique further provides a ready ability to prepare and test
20 sequence variants, for example, incorporating one or more of the foregoing considerations,
   by introducing one or more nucleotide sequence changes into the DNA. Site-specific
   mutagenesis allows the production of mutants through the use of specific oligonucleotide
   sequences which encode the DNA sequence of the desired mutation, as well as a sufficient
   number of adjacent nucleotides, to provide a primer sequence of sufficient size and
25 sequence complexity to form a stable duplex on both sides of the deletion junction being
   traversed. Typically, a primer of about 17 to about 75 nucleotides or more in length is
   preferred, with about 10 to about 25 or more residues on both sides of the junction of the
   sequence being altered.
30 In general, the technique of site-specific mutagenesis is well known in the art, as exemplified
   by various publications. As will be appreciated, the technique typically employs a phage
   vector, which exists in both a single stranded and double stranded form. Typical vectors
   useful in site-directed mutagenesis include vectors such as the M13 phage. These phages
   are readily commercially available and their use is generally well known to those skilled in
35 the art. Double stranded plasmids also are routinely employed in site directed mutagenesis,
   which eliminates the step of transferring the gene of interest from a plasmid to a phage.
   In general, site-directed mutagenesis in accordance herewith is performed by first obtaining
   a single-stranded vector or melting apart of two strands of a double stranded vector which
40 includes within                   its sequence a DNA sequence which encodes the promoter. An

                                                  49
   oligonucleotide primer bearing the desired mutated sequence is prepared, generally
   synthetically. This primer is then annealed with the single-stranded vector, and subjected to
   DNA polymerizing enzymes such as E. coli polymerase I Klenow fragment, in order to
   complete the synthesis of the mutation-bearing strand. Thus, a heteroduplex is formed
 5 wherein one strand encodes the original non-mutated sequence and the second strand
   bears the desired mutation. This heteroduplex vector is then used to transform or transfect
   appropriate cells, such as E. coli cells, and cells are selected which include recombinant
   vectors bearing the mutated sequence arrangement. Vector DNA can then be isolated from
   these cells and used for plant transformation. A genetic selection scheme was devised by
10 Kunkel et al. (1987) to enrich for clones incorporating mutagenic oligonucleotides.
   Alternatively, the use of PCR with commercially available thermostable enzymes such as
   Taq polymerase may be used to incorporate a mutagenic oligonucleotide primer into an
   amplified DNA fragment that can then be cloned into an appropriate cloning or expression
   vector. The PCR-mediated mutagenesis procedures of Tomic et al. (1990) and Upender et
15 al. (1995) provide two examples of such protocols. A PCR employing a thermostable ligase
   in addition to a thermostable polymerase also may be used to incorporate a phosphorylated
   mutagenic oligonucleotide into an amplified DNA fragment that may then be cloned into an
   appropriate cloning or expression vector. The mutagenesis procedure described by Michael
   (1994) provides an example of one such protocol.
20
   The preparation of sequence variants of the selected promoter-encoding DNA segments
   using site-directed mutagenesis is provided as a means of producing potentially useful
   species and is not meant to be limiting, as there are other ways in which sequence variants
   of DNA sequences may be obtained. For example, recombinant vectors encoding the
25 desired promoter sequence may be treated with mutagenic agents, such as hydroxylamine,
   to obtain sequence variants.
   As used herein; the term "oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis procedure" refers to
   template-dependent processes and vector-mediated propagation which result in an increase
30 in the concentration of a specific nucleic acid molecule relative to its initial concentration, or
   in an increase in the concentration of a detectable signal, such as amplification. As used
   herein, the term "oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis procedure" also is intended to refer
   to a process that involves the template-dependent extension of a primer molecule. The term
   template-dependent process refers to nucleic acid synthesis of an RNA or a DNA molecule
35 wherein the sequence of the newly synthesized strand of nucleic acid is dictated by the well
   known rules of complementary base pairing (see, for example, Watson and Rarnstad, 1987).
   Typically, vector mediated methodologies involve the introduction of the nucleic acid
   fragment into a DNA or RNA vector, the clonal amplification of the vector, and the recovery
   of the amplified nucleic acid fragment. Examples of such methodologies are provided by
40 U.S. Pat. No. 4,237,224. A number of template-dependent processes are available to
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

   amplify the target sequences of interest present in a sample, such methods being well
   known in the art and specifically disclosed herein below.
   Where a clone comprising a promoter has been isolated in accordance with the instant
 5 invention, one may wish to delimit the essential promoter regions within the clone. One
   efficient, targeted means for preparing mutagenizing promoters relies upon the identification
   of putative regulatory elements within the promoter sequence. This can be initiated by
   comparison with promoter sequences known to be expressed in similar tissue-specific or
   developmentally unique manner. Sequences, which are shared among promoters with
10 similar expression patterns, are likely candidates for the binding of transcription factors and
   are thus likely elements that confer expression patterns. Confirmation of these putative
   regulatory elements can be achieved by deletion analysis of each putative regulatory region
   followed by functional analysis of each deletion construct by assay of a reporter gene, which
   is functionally attached to each construct. As such, once a starting promoter sequence is
15 provided, any of a number of different deletion mutants of the starting promoter could be
   readily prepared.
   Functionally equivalent fragments of a transcription regulating nucleotide molecule of the
   invention can also be obtained by removing or deleting non-essential sequences without
20 deleting the essential one. Narrowing the transcription regulating nucleotide molecule to its
   essential, transcription mediating elements can be realized in vitro by trial-and-error deletion
   mutations, or in silico using promoter element search routines. Regions essential for
   promoter activity often demonstrate clusters of certain, known promoter elements. Such
   analysis can be performed using available computer algorithms such as PLACE ("Plant Cis
25 acting Regulatory DNA              Elements"; Higo 1999), the BIOBASE database "Transfac"
   (Biologische Datenbanken GmbH, Braunschweig; Wingender 2001)                  or the database
   PlantCARE (Lescot 2002).
   A method for producing such regulatory nucleic acid molecules with mutated sequences
30 regulating the same expression specificity as the parent sequence or reference sequence is
   for example defined in US 61/419895 and EP 10193800.9.
   Preferably, functional equivalent fragments of one of the transcription regulating nucleotide
   sequences of the invention comprises at least 250 base pairs, preferably, at least 300 base
35 pairs, more preferably at least 400 base pairs, even more preferably 500 base pairs, most
   preferably 750 base pairs of a transcription regulating nucleotide molecule as described by
   SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18, . More preferably
   this fragment is starting from the 3'-end of the indicated sequences.
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                      51
   Especially preferred are           equivalent fragments of transcription regulating nucleotide
   sequences, which are obtained by deleting the region encoding the 5-untranslated region of
   the mRNA, thus only providing the (untranscribed) promoter region. The 5-untranslated
   region can be easily determined by methods known in the art (such as 5'-RACE analysis).
 5 Accordingly, some of the transcription regulating nucleotide sequences of the invention are
   equivalent fragments of other sequences.
   An expression cassette of the invention may comprise further regulatory elements. The term
   in this context is to be understood in a broad meaning comprising all sequences, which may
   influence construction or function of the expression cassette. Regulatory elements may for
10 example modify transcription and/or translation in prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism. In an
   preferred embodiment the expression cassette of the invention comprised downstream (in
   3'-direction) of the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed a transcription termination
   sequence and - optionally additional regulatory elements - each operably liked to the
   nucleic acid sequence to be expressed (or the transcription regulating nucleotide sequence).
15
   Additional regulatory elements may comprise additional promoter, minimal promoters, or
   promoter elements, which may modify the expression regulating properties. For example the
   expression may be made depending on certain stress factors such water stress, abscisin
   (Lam 1991) or heat stress (Schoffl 1989). Furthermore additional promoters or promoter
20 elements may be employed, which may realize expression in other organisms (such as
   E.coli or Agrobacterium). Such regulatory elements can be found in the promoter sequences
   or bacteria such as amy and SPO2 or in the promoter sequences of yeast or fungal
   promoters (such as ADC1, MFa, AC, P-60, CYC1, GAPDH, TEF, rp28, and ADH).
25 Furthermore, it is contemplated that promoters combining elements from more than one
   promoter may be useful. For example, US 5,491,288 discloses combining a Cauliflower
   Mosaic Virus promoter with a histone promoter. Thus, the elements from the promoters
   disclosed herein may be combined with elements from other promoters. Promoters, which
   are useful for plant transgene expression include those that are inducible, viral, synthetic,
30 constitutive (Odell 1985), temporally regulated, spatially regulated, tissue-specific, and
   spatial-temporally regulated.
   Where expression in specific tissues or organs is desired, tissue-specific promoters may be
   used. In contrast, where gene expression in response to a stimulus is desired, inducible
35 promoters are the regulatory elements of choice. Such inducible promoters may additionally
   be tissue or organ specifically expressed and or induced. Where continuous expression is
   desired throughout the cells of a plant, constitutive promoters are utilized. Additional
   regulatory sequences upstream and/or downstream from the core promoter sequence may
   be included in expression constructs of transformation vectors to bring about varying levels
40 of expression of heterologous nucleotide sequences in a transgenic plant.

                                                   52
   A variety of 5' and 3' transcriptional regulatory sequences are available for use in the
   present invention. Transcriptional terminators are responsible for the termination of
   transcription and correct mRNA polyadenylation. The 3' nontranslated regulatory DNA
 5 sequence preferably includes from about 50 to about 1,000, more preferably about 100 to
   about 1,000, nucleotide base pairs and contains plant transcriptional and translational
   termination sequences. Appropriate transcriptional terminators and those which are known
   to function in plants include the CaMV 35S terminator, the tml terminator, the nopaline
   synthase terminator, the pea rbcS E9 terminator, the terminator for the T7 transcript from the
10 octopine synthase gene of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and the 3' end of the protease
   inhibitor I or || genes from potato or tomato, although other 3' elements known to those of
   skill in the art can also be employed. Alternatively, one also could use a gamma coixin,
   oleosin 3 or other terminator from the genus Coix.
15 Preferred 3' elements include those from the nopaline synthase gene of Agrobacterium
   tumefaciens (Bevan 1983), the terminator for the T7 transcript from the octopine synthase
   gene of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and the 3' end of the protease inhibitor I or || genes
   from potato or tomato.
20 As the DNA sequence between the transcription initiation site and the start of the coding
   sequence, i.e., the untranslated leader sequence, can influence gene expression, one may
   also wish to employ a particular leader sequence. Preferred leader sequences are
   contemplated to include those, which include sequences, predicted to direct optimum
   expression of the attached gene, i.e., to include a preferred consensus leader sequence,
25 which may increase or maintain mRNA stability and prevent inappropriate initiation of
   translation. The choice of such sequences will be known to those of skill in the art in light of
   the present disclosure. Sequences that are derived from genes that are highly expressed in
   plants will be most preferred.
30 Preferred regulatory elements also include the 5-untranslated region, introns and the 3'
   untranslated region of genes. Such sequences that have been found to enhance gene
   expression in transgenic plants include intron sequences (e.g., from Adh1, bronze, acting,
   actin 2 (WO 00/760067),            or other plant introns as disclosed in W02011/023537,
   W02011/023539, W02006/094976.
35
   Additional preferred regulatory elements are enhancer sequences or polyadenylation
   sequences.
   The heterologous nucleotide sequence to be expressed is preferably furthermore operably
40 linked to 3'-untranslated regions, transcription termination and/or polyadenylation signal. 3'
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                    53
   untranslated regions are suitable to stabilize mRNA expression and structure. This can
   result in prolonged presence of the mRNA and thus enhanced expression levels.
   Termination and polyadenylation signals are suitable to stabilize mRNA expression, to
   ensure constant mRNA transcript length and to prevent read-through transcription.
 5 Especially in multigene expression constructs this is an important feature. Furthermore
   correct termination of transcription is linked to re-initiation of transcription from the regulatory
   5'nucleotide sequence resulting in enhanced expression levels. The above-mentioned
   signals can be any signal functional in plants and can for example be isolated from plant
   genes, plant virus genes or other plant pathogens. However, in a preferred embodiment the
10 3'-untranslated regions, transcription termination and polyadenylation signals are from the
   genes employed as the source for the promoters of this invention.
   Preferred polyadenylation sequences are those from plant genes or Agrobacterium T-DNA
   genes (such as for example the terminator sequences of the OCS (octopine synthase) or
15 NOS (nopaline synthase) genes).
   Examples of enhancers include elements from the CaMV 35S promoter, octopine synthase
   genes (Ellis el al., 1987), the rice actin I gene, the maize alcohol dehydrogenase gene
   (Callis 1987), the maize shrunken I gene (Vasil 1989), TMV Omega element (Gallie 1989)
   and promoters from non-plant eukaryotes (e.g. yeast; Ma 1988). Vectors for use in
20 accordance with the present invention may be constructed to include the ocs enhancer
   element. This element was first identified as a 16 bp palindromic enhancer from the octopine
   synthase (ocs) gene of ultilane (Ellis 1987), and is present in at least 10 other promoters
   (Bouchez 1989). The use of an enhancer element, such as the ocs elements and particularly
   multiple copies of the element, will act to increase the level of transcription from adjacent
25 promoters when applied in the context of plant transformation.
   An expression cassette of the invention (or a vector derived thereof) may comprise
   additional functional elements, which are to be understood in the broad sense as all
   elements, which influence construction, propagation, or function of an expression cassette or
30 a vector or a transgenic organism comprising them. Such functional elements may include
   origin of replications (to allow replication in bacteria; for the ORI of pBR322 or the P15A ori;
   Sambrook 1989), or elements required for Agrobacterium T-DNA transfer (such as for
   example the left and/or rights border of the T-DNA).
35 Ultimately, the most desirable DNA segments for introduction into, for example, a dicot
   genome, may be homologous genes or gene families which encode a desired trait (e.g.,
   increased yield per acre, fungal resistance) and which are introduced under the control of
   novel promoters or enhancers, etc., or perhaps even homologous or tissue specific (e.g.,
   root-, collar/sheath-, whorl-, stalk-, earshank-, kernel- or leaf-specific) promoters or control
40 elements. Indeed, it is envisioned that a particular use of the present invention will be the
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                      54
   expression of a gene in the epidermis or mesophyll or inducible in the epidermis and/or
   mesophyll.
   Additionally, vectors may be constructed and employed in the intracellular targeting of a
 5 specific gene product within the cells of a transgenic plant or in directing a protein to the
   extracellular environment. This will generally be achieved by joining a DNA sequence
   encoding a transit or signal peptide sequence to the coding sequence of a particular gene.
   The resultant transit or signal peptide will transport the protein to a particular intracellular or
   extracellular destination, respectively, and will then be post-translationally removed. Transit
10 or signal peptides act by facilitating the transport of proteins through intracellular
   membranes, e.g., vacuole, vesicle, plastid and mitochondrial membranes, whereas signal
   peptides direct proteins through the extracellular membrane.
   A particular example of such a use concerns the direction of a herbicide resistance gene,
15 such as the EPSPS gene, to a particular organelle such as the chloroplast rather than to the
   cytoplasm. This is exemplified by the use of the rbcs transit peptide which confers plastid
   specific targeting of proteins. In addition, it is proposed that it may be desirable to target
   certain genes responsible for male sterility to the mitochondria, or to target certain genes for
   resistance to phytopathogenic organisms to the extracellular spaces, or to target proteins to
20 the vacuole.
   By facilitating the transport of the protein into compartments inside and outside the cell,
   these sequences may increase the accumulation of gene product protecting them from
   proteolytic degradation. These sequences also allow for additional mRNA sequences from
25 highly expressed genes to be attached to the coding sequence of the genes. Since mRNA
   being translated by ribosomes is more stable than naked mRNA, the presence of
   translatable mRNA in front of the gene may increase the overall stability of the mRNA
   transcript from the gene and thereby increase synthesis of the gene product. Since transit
   and signal sequences are usually post-translationally removed from the initial translation
30 product, the use of these sequences allows for the addition of extra translated sequences
   that may not appear on the final polypeptide. Targeting of certain proteins may be desirable
   in order to enhance the stability of the protein (US 5,545,818).
   It may be useful to target DNA itself within a cell. For example, it may be useful to target
35 introduced DNA to the nucleus as this may increase the frequency of transformation. Within
   the nucleus itself it would be useful to target a gene in order to achieve site-specific
   integration.             For example, it would be useful to have a gene introduced through
   transformation replace an existing gene in the cell. Other elements include those that can be
   regulated by endogenous or exogenous agents, e.g., by zinc finger proteins, including
40 naturally occurring zinc finger proteins or chimeric zinc finger proteins (see, e.g., US
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                   55
   5,789,538, WO 99/48909; WO 99/45132; WO 98/53060; WO 98/53057; WO 98/53058; WO
   00/23464; WO 95/19431; and WO 98/54311) or myb-like transcription factors. For example,
   a chimeric zinc finger protein may include amino acid sequences, which bind to a specific
   DNA sequence (the zinc finger) and amino acid sequences that activate (e.g., GAL 4
 5 sequences) or repress the transcription of the sequences linked to the specific DNA
   sequence.
   It is one of the objects of the present invention to provide recombinant DNA molecules
   comprising a nucleotide sequence according to the invention operably linked to a nucleotide
10 segment of interest.
   A nucleotide segment of interest is reflective of the commercial markets and interests of
   those involved in the development of the crop. Crops and markets of interest changes, and
   as developing nations open up world markets, new crops and technologies will also emerge.
15 In addition, as the understanding of agronomic traits and characteristics such as yield and
   heterosis increase, the choice of genes for transformation will change accordingly. General
   categories of nucleotides of interest include, for example, genes involved in information,
   such as zinc fingers, those involved in communication, such as kinases, and those involved
   in housekeeping, such as heat shock proteins. More specific categories of transgenes, for
20 example, include genes encoding important traits for agronomics, insect resistance, disease
   resistance, herbicide resistance, sterility, grain characteristics, and commercial products.
   Genes of interest include, generally, those involved in starch, oil, carbohydrate, or nutrient
   metabolism, as well as those affecting kernel size, sucrose loading, zinc finger proteins, see,
   e.g., US 5,789,538, WO 99/48909; WO 99/45132; WO 98/53060; WO 98/53057; WO
25 98/53058; WO 00/23464; WO 95/19431; and WO 98/54311, and the like.
   One skilled in the art recognizes that the expression level and regulation of a transgene in a
   plant can vary significantly from line to line. Thus, one has to test several lines to find one
   with the desired expression level and regulation. Once a line is identified with the desired
30 regulation specificity of a chimeric Cre transgene, it can be crossed with lines carrying
   different inactive replicons or inactive transgene for activation.
   Other sequences, which may be linked to the gene of interest, which encodes a polypeptide,
   are those which can target to a specific organelle, e.g., to the mitochondria, nucleus, or
   plastid, within the plant cell. Targeting can be achieved by providing the polypeptide with an
35 appropriate targeting peptide sequence, such as a secretory signal peptide (for secretion or
   cell wall or membrane targeting, a plastid transit peptide, a chloroplast transit peptide, e.g.,
   the chlorophyll a/b binding protein, a mitochondrial target peptide, a vacuole targeting
   peptide, or a nuclear targeting peptide, and the like. For example, the small subunit of
   ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase transit peptide, the EPSPS transit peptide or the
40 dihydrodipicolinic acid synthase transit peptide may be used, for examples of plastid
   10443281_1 (GHMatters) P94625.AU.2

                                                          56
   organelle targeting sequences (see WO 00/12732). Plastids are a class of plant organelles
   derived          from          proplastids and include chloroplasts, leucoplasts, amyloplasts, and
   chromoplasts. The plastids are major sites of biosynthesis in plants. In addition to
   photosynthesis in the chloroplast, plastids are also sites of lipid biosynthesis, nitrate
 5 reduction to ammonium, and starch storage. And while plastids contain their own circular
   genome, most of the proteins localized to the plastids are encoded by the nuclear genome
   and are imported into the organelle from the cytoplasm.
   Transgenes used with the present invention will often be genes that direct the expression of
10 a particular protein or polypeptide product, but they may also be non-expressible DNA
   segments, e.g., transposons such as Ds that do no direct their own transposition. As used
   herein, an "expressible gene" is any gene that is capable of being transcribed into RNA
   (e.g., mRNA, antisense RNA, etc.) or translated into a protein, expressed as a trait of
   interest, or the like, etc., and is not limited to selectable, screenable or non-selectable
15 marker genes. The invention also contemplates that, where both an expressible gene that is
   not necessarily a marker gene is employed in combination with a marker gene, one may
   employ the separate genes on either the same or different                        DNA segments for
   transformation. In the latter case, the different vectors are delivered concurrently to recipient
   cells to maximize cotransformation.
20
   The choice of the particular DNA segments to be delivered to the recipient cells will often
   depend on the purpose of the transformation. One of the major purposes of transformation
   of crop plants is to add some commercially desirable, agronomically important traits to the
   plant. Such traits include, but are not limited to, herbicide resistance or tolerance; insect
25 resistance or tolerance; disease resistance or tolerance (viral, bacterial, fungal, nematode);
   stress tolerance and/or resistance, as exemplified by resistance or tolerance to drought,
   heat, chilling, freezing, excessive moisture, salt stress; oxidative stress; increased yields;
   food content and makeup; physical appearance; male sterility; drydown; standability;
   prolificacy; starch properties; oil quantity and quality; and the like. One may desire to
30 incorporate one or more genes conferring any such desirable trait or traits, such as, for
   example, a gene or genes encoding pathogen resistance.
   In certain embodiments, the present invention contemplates the transformation of a recipient
   cell with more than one advantageous transgene. Two or more transgenes can be supplied
35 in a single transformation event using either distinct transgene-encoding vectors, or using a
   single vector incorporating two or more gene coding sequences. For example, plasmids
   bearing the bar and aroA expression units in either convergent, divergent, or colinear
   orientation, are considered to be particularly useful. Further preferred combinations are
   those of an insect resistance gene, such as a Bt gene, along with a protease inhibitor gene
40 such as pinli, or the use of bar in combination with either of the above genes. Of course, any

                                                     57
   two or more transgenes of any description, such as those conferring herbicide, insect,
   disease (viral, bacterial, fungal, nematode) or drought resistance, male sterility, drydown,
   standability, prolificacy, starch properties, oil quantity and quality, or those increasing yield or
   nutritional quality may be employed as desired.

   1.3       Confirmation of allele-specific expression pattern using quantitativereverse
10 transcriptase-polymerasechain reaction (qRT-PCR)
   In order to confirm the native expression patterns of the identified soybean genes in an
   allele-specific manner, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed
   using total RNA isolated from the same materials as were used for the AFLP expression
   profiling (Table 1).
15
   Primers for qRT-PCR were designed based on the sequences of the isolated EST fragments
   using the Vector NTI software package (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Primers were
   designed to distinguish individual alleles of the candidate gene in the tetraploid soybean
   genome. Primers for qRT-PCR are listed in table 3. The tubulin gene served as a control for
20 normalization purposes.

   qRT-PCR was performed using QuantiTect Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and SYBR Green
   qPCR Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) in a Roche LightCycler (Roche
 5 Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). cDNA was synthesized using 800 ng of total RNA and 1
   pl reverse transcriptase in a 20 pl volume. The cDNA was diluted with 60 pl of RNAse free
   water to a final volume of 80 pl. 4 pl of diluted cDNA were used in a 10 pl PCR reaction
   according to manufacturer's instruction. The thermocycling conditions were as follows:
   Denature at 950C for 2 minutes, and run 45 cycles at 950C for 10 seconds and 600C for 20
10 seconds and 720C for 20 seconds for amplification. After the final cycle of the amplification,
   the dissociation curve analysis was carried out to verify that the amplification occurred
   specifically and no primer dimer product was generated during the amplification process.
   The tubulin gene (primer sequences in table 3) was used as an endogenous reference gene
   to normalize the calculation using the Comparative Ct (Cycle of threshold) value method.
15 The DeltaCt value was obtained by subtracting the Ct value of tubulin gene from the Ct
   value of the respective candidate gene, and the relative transcription quantity (expression
   level) of the candidate gene was expressed as 2 -DeltaCt
   1.4 Identification of the promoter region
20 For promoter identification purposes, the sequence upstream of the start codon of the
   identified genes was defined as the respective promoter. To characterize these promoter
   regions, 5'RACE PCR analyses were performed using the primers listed in table 4.

   1.5 Isolation of the promoter region by PCR amplification
   The promoter regions of the respective genes were isolated via genomic PCR using the
 5 following sequence specific primers (table 5):
   Promoters putatively conferring constitutive expression or expression in the epidermis
   amplified with these primer pairs are listed in table 6.
10 In addition 5'-deletions of the promoters are made by using different 5' primers in
   combination with the same 3' oligonucleotide primer. The resulting promoters are indicated
   by their respective length in base pairs (cp. table 6) and the corresponding primer pairs for
   PCR are listed in table 5.
15 Promoters are bioinformatically analyzed with MatInspector Professional 8.0.4, Release
   August 2010 (Genomatix Software GmbH; Munich, Germany) for transcription factor binding
   sites. Regions free of core motifs are permutated and the resulting nucleic acid sequences
   are synthesized. The principles for generating permutated promoters that retain their
   respective tissue specificities are described in EP10193800.9 und US61/419895. The
20 resulting sequences are indicated by the original identifier of the corresponding gene
   followed by "_perm" (cp. table 6).

 5 1.6 Cloning of promoter elements into the context of a GUS reporter gene cassette
   To facilitate sub-cloning, promoter elements were modified by the addition of Kpnl+Acc651
   restriction enzyme sites at their 5' end and Pacl+Ncol sites at their 3'end.
   Using the Multisite Gateway System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), the
10 promoter::reporter-gene cassettes were assembled into binary constructs for plant
   transformation. The respective Glycine max promoters (with the prefix p- denoting promoter)
   were used in the reporter gene construct, and betaglucoronidase coding sequence (GUS)
   was utilized as reporter protein for subsequent histo-chemical analysis.
15 An ENTR/A vector containing the betaglucoronidase coding sequence followed by the t-nos
   nopalin synthase transcriptional terminator (Genbank V00087) was generated. Glycine max
   promoters were cloned using the restriction enzyme sites (see above) added by PCR
   amplification at either end. Positive pENTR/A clones underwent sequence analysis to
   ensure correctness.

                                                          65
   The pENTR/B and pENTR/C did not contain any additional elements. By performing a site
   specific recombination (LR-reaction), the created pENTR/A, pENTR/B and pENTR/C were
   combined with the pSUN destination vector (pSUN derivative) according to the
 5 manufacturers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) Multisite Gateway manual. The reactions
   yielded binary vectors LJK291, LJK296, LJK303, LJK304, LJK305 (cp. table7) with the
   respective Glycine max promoter, the GUS coding sequence c-GUS and the t-nos
   terminator, with promoter molecules having the prefix p-, coding sequences having the prefix
   c-, and terminator molecules having the prefix t-.

   1.7 Generation                   of transgenic soybean  plants (amended protocol according to
         W02005/121345; Olhoft et al., 2007).
   Soybean seed germination, propagation, A. rhizogenes and axillary meristem explant
20 preparation, and inoculations were done as previously described (W02005/121345; Olhoft
   et al., 2007) with the exception that the LJK291, LJK296, LJK303, LJK304, LJK305 (cp.
   example 1.6) each contained a mutated AHAS gene driven by the parsley ubiquitin promoter
   PcUbi4-2, mediating tolerance to imidazolinone herbicides for selection.
25 1.8 Promoter evaluation in transgenic soybean
   Expression patterns and levels driven by the constitutive promoters and promoters putatively
   conferring expression in the epidermis measured using GUS histo-chemical analysis
   following a protocol known in the art (Jefferson 1987). GUS expression was assayed in the
   following vegetative and reproductive tissue for the constitutive promoters at various
30 developmental stages:
         1) leaf surface
         2) root
         3) stem
         4) stem section

          11) silique seed-pocket
          12) silique end
10 Expression in the epidermis was assayed in leaf surface views and sections based on visual
   assessment of the GUS staining. LJK291 and LJK296 showed constitutive expression in all
   analyzed tissues. LJK303, LJK304 and LJK305 showed strong expression in the lower leaf
   epidermis and parts of the spongy layer of mesophyll as well as some background
   expression in reproductive stages of the plant and can therefore be considered as epidermis
15 preferential promoters. The permutated promoters and the 5'deleted versions of the
   promoters show the same expression patterns as the original promoters they are derived
   from.
   The results are indicated in table 8.

   Example 2: Identification and validation of pathogen-inducible promoters from
   soybean
   2.1 Identification of pathogen-inducible transcripts by AFLP
 5 AFLP bands from table 1 were selected for pathogen-inducible expression in epidermis or
   both mesophyll and epidermis.
   2.2 Identification of the genes corresponding to AFLP bands
   Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequences of AFLP bands were used as query for
10 BLASTN searching against a soybean sequence database. The corresponding genes are
   listed in table 9
   2.3 Identification of pathogen-inducible transcripts by microarray
   In addition to identification of ESTs by AFLP, a microarray experiment was performed in
15 triplicate for samples 3 and 5-8 from table 1, which identified the following genes:
   Glyma0l g33070.2; Glyma0l g42660.1 (cp. Table 9).

   2.4 Confirmation of allele-specific expression pattern        using quantitative reverse
         transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
   In order to confirm the native expression patterns of soybean genes in an allele-specific
   manner from both AFLP and microarray approaches, quantitative reverse transcription PCR
25 (qRT-PCR) was performed using total RNA isolated from the same materials as were used
   for the AFLP expression profiling and the microarray experiment (cp. table 1).
   Primers for qRT-PCR were designed based on the sequences of the isolated EST fragments
   or on microarray data using the Vector NTI software package (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
30 USA). Primers were designed to distinguish individual alleles of the candidate gene in the

   qRT-PCR was performed using QuantiTect Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and SYBR Green
   qPCR Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) in a Roche LightCycler (Roche
   Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). cDNA was synthesized using 800 ng of total RNA and 1
   pl reverse transcriptase in a 20 pl volume. The cDNA was diluted with 60 pl of RNAse free
10 water to a final volume of 80 pl. 4 pl of diluted cDNA were used in a 10 pl PCR reaction
   according to manufacturer's instruction. The thermocycling conditions were as follows:
   Denature at 950C for 2 minutes, and run 45 cycles at 950C for 10 seconds and 600C for 20
   seconds and 720C for 20 seconds for amplification. After the final cycle of the amplification,
   the dissociation curve analysis was carried out to verify that the amplification occurred
15 specifically and no primer dimer product was generated during the amplification process.
   The tubulin gene (primer sequences in table 2) was used as an endogenous reference gene
   to normalize the calculation using the Comparative Ct (Cycle of threshold) value method.
   The DeltaCt value was obtained by subtracting the Ct value of tubulin gene from the Ct
   value of the respective candidate gene, and the relative transcription quantity (expression
20 level) of the candidate gene was expressed as 2 -DeltaCt

   2.6 Isolation of the promoter region by PCR amplification
10 The promoter regions of the respective genes were isolated via genomic PCR using the
   following sequence specific primers (table 12).
   Promoters putatively conferring pathogen-inducible expression amplified with these primer
   pairs are listed in table 13.
15
   In addition 5'-deletions of the promoters are made by using different 5' primers in
   combination with the same 3' oligonucleotide primer. The resulting promoters are indicated
   by their respective length in base pairs (cp. table 13) and the corresponding primer pairs for
   PCR are listed in table 12.
20
   Promoters are bioinformatically analyzed with Matlnspector professional 8.0.4, Release
   August 2010 (Genomatix Software GmbH; Munich, Germany) for transcription factor binding
   sites. Regions free of core motifs are permutated and the resulting nucleic acid sequences
   are synthesized. The principles for generating permutated promoters that retain their
25 respective tissue specificities are described in EP10193800.9 und US61/419895. The
   resulting sequences are indicated by the original identifier of the corresponding gene
   followed by "_perm" (cp. table 13).

  2.7 Cloning of promoter elements into the context of a GUS reporter gene cassette
5 To facilitate sub-cloning, promoter elements were modified by the addition of Kpnl and
  Acc651 restriction enzyme sites at their 5' end and Pacl andNcol sites at their 3'end.

   Using the Multisite Gateway System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), the
   promoter::reporter-gene cassettes were assembled into binary constructs for plant
   transformation. The respective Glycine max promoters (with the prefix p- denoting promoter)
   were used in the reporter gene construct, and beta-glucoronidase coding sequence (GUS)
 5 was utilized as reporter protein for subsequent histo-chemical analysis.
   An ENTR/A vector containing the beta-glucoronidase coding sequence followed by the t-nos
   nopalin synthase transcriptional terminator (Genbank V00087) was generated. Glycine max
   promoters were cloned using the restriction enzyme sites (see above) added by PCR
10 amplification at either end. Positive pENTR/A clones underwent sequence analysis to
   ensure correctness.
   The pENTR/B and pENTR/C did not contain any additional elements. By performing a site
   specific recombination (LR-reaction), the created pENTR/A, pENTR/B and pENTR/C were
15 combined with the pSUN destination vector (pSUN derivative) according to the
   manufacturers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) Multisite Gateway manual. The reactions
   yielded binary vectors LJK306, LJK331, LJK334, LJK358, LJK360, LJK361, LJK363, LJK372
   (cp. table 14) with the respective Glycine max promoter, the GUS coding sequence c-GUS
   and the t-nos terminator, with promoter molecules having the prefix p-, coding sequences
20 having the prefix c-, and terminator molecules having the prefix t-.

   2.9 Promoter evaluation in transgenic soybean
   Expression patterns and levels driven by the putatively pathogen-inducible promoters were
   measured using GUS histochemical analysis following a protocol known in the art (Jefferson
    1987).        Soybean             transformation was conducted using an Agrobacterium-mediated
10 transformation system.
   The rust fungus is a wild isolate from Brazil. The plants were inoculated with P.pachyrhizi.
   In order to obtain appropriate spore material for the inoculation, soy leaves which had been
15 infected with rust 15-20 days ago, were taken 2-3 days before the inoculation and
   transferred to agar plates (1% agar in H2 0). The leaves were placed with their upper side
   onto the agar, which allowed the fungus to grow through the tissue and to produce very
   young spores. For the inoculation solution, the spores were knocked off the leaves and were
   added to a Tween-H 2 0 solution. The counting of spores was performed under a light
20 microscope by means of a Thoma counting chamber. For the inoculation of the plants, the
   spore suspension was added into a compressed-air operated spray flask and applied
   uniformly onto the plants or the leaves until the leaf surface is well moisturized. For
   macroscopic assays a spore density of 1-5x10 5 spores/ml was used. For microscopy, a
   density of >5 x 101 spores / ml was used. The inoculated plants were placed for 24 hours in
25 a darkened greenhouse chamber with an average of 220C and >90% of air humidity. The
   following cultivation was performed in a chamber with an average of 250C and 70% of air
   humidity for 48 hours.
   GUS expression for pathogen-inducible promoters putatively conferring expression in the
30 epidermis or in mesophyll and epidermis was assayed in leaf surface views and sections
   based on visual inspection. All promoters showed inducibility by soybean rust, either
   preferentially in the epidermis or in both epidermis and mesophyll. The permutated
   promoters and the 5'deleted versions of the promoters show the same expression patterns
   as the original promoters they are derived from.

   3.1 Isolation of the promoter regions from of A. thaliana putatively conferring
         expression in green tissue of plants by PCR amplification
 5
   A. thaliana promoter elements putatively conferring expression in green tissue of plants were
   amplified by PCR using the primers listed in table 21. Preferentially the cloned region
   encompassed 1-2 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site or up to the stop codon of the
   previous open-reading frame. The corresponding genes are listed in table 22. The
10 corresponding promoter sequences are listed in table 23.
   In addition 5'-deletions of the promoters are made by using different 5' primers in
   combination with the same 3' oligonucleotide primer. The resulting promoters are indicated
   by their respective length in base pairs (cp. table 23) and the corresponding primer pairs for
15 PCR are listed in table 21.
   Promoters are bioinformatically analyzed with Matlnspector professional 8.0.4, Release
   August 2010 (Genomatix Software GmbH; Munich, Germany) for transcription factor binding
   sites. Regions free of core motifs are permutated and the resulting nucleic acid sequences
20 are synthesized. The principles for generating permutated promoters that retain their
   respective tissue specificities are described in EP10193800.9 und US61/419895. The
   resulting sequences are indicated by the original identifier of the corresponding gene
   followed by "_perm" (cp. table 23).

   Using the Multisite Gateway System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), the
 5 promoter::reporter-gene cassettes were assembled into binary constructs for plant
   transformation. The respective Arabidopsis thaliana promoters (with the prefix p- denoting
   promoter) were used in the reporter gene construct, and Green Fluorescent Protein coding
   sequence (c-AcGFP1; Clontech Laboratories Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) was utilized as
   reporter protein for subsequent fluorescence microscopic analysis.
10
   An ENTR/A vector containing the Green Fluorescent protein coding sequence followed by
   the t-OCS agrobacterium terminator (Genbank DQ005456) was generated. Arabidopsis
   thaliana promoters were cloned using the restriction enzyme sites (see above) added by
   PCR amplification at either end. Positive pENTR/A clones underwent sequence analysis to
15 ensure correctness.
   The pENTR/B and pENTR/C did not contain any additional elements. By performing a site
   specific recombination (LR-reaction), the created pENTR/A, pENTR/B and pENTR/C were
   combined with the pSUN destination vector (pSUN derivative) according to the
20 manufacturers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) Multisite Gateway manual. The reactions
   yielded binary vectors LJK1 86, LJK1 89, LJK1 90, LJK192 and LJK193 (cp. table 25); with the
   respective Arabidopsis thaliana promoter, the Green Fluorescent Protein coding sequence
   c-AcGFP1 and the t-OCS terminator, with promoter molecules having the prefix p-, coding
   sequences having the prefix c-, and terminator molecules having the prefix t-.

   3.3 Test of the A. thaliana promoters putatively conferring expression in green tissue
         of plants in transgenic soybean
   Expression patterns and levels driven by the promoters putatively conferring expression in
   green tissue of plants were measured using GFP analysis. Analysis was performed with the
 5 Leica DM5000B microscope and the DFC490 camera with the following settings: Saturation
   1.01; Gain 1; Exposure 2.1s; GFP-filter: L5; Excitation 480/40nm; Dichromatic mirror:
   505nm; Suppression filter: 527/30nm.
   The three promoter elements in vectors LJK 189, LJK 190 and LJK 192 showed medium to
10 strong expression based on visual analysis exclusively in the mesophyll layer of leaves and
   can thus be rated mesophyll-specific. Promoter elements corresponding to LJK186 and
   LJK193 conferred preferential expression in the mesophyll layer of leaves as well as weak
   expression in the green tissue of the shoot and can thus be rated mesophyll-preferential.
   The permutated promoters and the 5'deleted versions of the promoters show the same
15 expression patterns as the original promoters they are derived from.
   The results are listed in table 26.
