               The present invention relates to medicine, in particular,
to            the            use              of            compounds            of     general       formula          I      or

containing viruses, and concomitant diseases.
                                                                         BACKGROUND
               Viral infections are a serious health problem. Antiviral
drugs             against                most               hazardous        and     dangerous     viral       infections
have not been developed, and the existing medicaments are often
toxic to humans or insufficiently effective. Most existing or
under-development drugs act through a specific interaction with
certain viral proteins. Such drugs have a limited spectrum of
activity                    and         promote                  a  rapid        emergence      of   resistant          virus
variants.                     According                        to   the     Baltimore         virus     classification
system, class                            I includes viruses whose genome                               is    composed of
double-stranded                                 DNA,            and   classes          IV   and  V   include         viruses
containing single-stranded (+) or                                                   (-)   RNA. One of the families
belonging to class I is the Adenoviridae family that comprises
the Mastadenovirus genus that is known to comprise 7 groups of
A        to        G.         Human               adenoviruses                  cause     a   variety       of     diseases
including                           conjunctivitis,                             gastroenteritis,               hepatitis,
myocarditis, and pneumonia. Children under the age of 5 years

                                                                         2
are most susceptible to adenovirus infection. From 5 to 7% of
all respiratory infections in children in the world are caused
by adenoviruses. Some serotypes                                            (for example, 14)       cause severe,
potentially                          lethal                  pneumonias.        Subgroup    A    viruses    cause
gastrointestinal                                    tract         diseases,     while   viruses     of  B   and  C
subgroups                     are         associated                with   respiratory     tract     infections.
Viruses of B (type 3),                                          D and E subgroups cause conjunctivitis.
Subgroup E viruses are also associated with respiratory tract
infections. Viruses of F and G subgroups cause gastroenteritis.
               Another                family                 of   I  class   is   the   Herpesviridae      family
comprising the Simplex Virus Genus that includes herpes simplex
virus               types              1        and          2    (HSV-1)    and    (HSV-2).     After    primary
infection, these viruses cause latent infection that persists
throughout life with periodic activation. In a child, infection
can          be       both           asymptomatic                    and   severe,    involving     the   central
nervous system. HSV infection in babies before or during labor,
which             can cause                     a disease            of  the eye,     skin,    central    nervous
system or even lead to a disseminated infection, is especially
dangerous. Infection of the central nervous system in children
under the age of 3 months leads to herpes encephalitis that, in
most cases, is caused by HSV-1. HSV-2 causes genital infection
that in general is sexually transmitted. In 2012, 417 million
people in the world aged 15 to 49 years have been calculated to
be infected with the HSV-2 virus, which is 11.3%; 267 millions
of         them           are women.                        In   addition,     19.2   millions     of the   total
number of infected people were infected in 2012, which is 0.5%.
HSV-2 infection is characterized by periodical symptomatic or
asymptomatic viral shedding and by the appearance of painful
genital ulcers. In addition, HSV-2 has been shown to increase
three times the chance of infection with human immunodeficiency
virus and accelerates the disease progression.

               Class IV includes representatives of the Enterovirus genus
of the Picornaviridae family and the Coronaviridae family, and
class               V        includes                       respiratory      syncytial     virus    (RSV)   and
metapneumovirus of the Paramyxoviridae family.
               The recited groups of viruses have developed an effective
strategy of inhibiting the cellular antiviral program. Such an
aggressive                        strategy                    of   inhibiting      the   cellular    antiviral
defense system leads to high contagiousness and pathogenicity
of these virus groups.
               Infection caused by human coronavirus                                     (CoV) (Coronaviridae
family) traditionally has a low yearly percentage of lower and
upper              respiratory                            tract    infections.      More   severe   course   of
disease is observed in elderly people with weakened immunity,
and in children. HCoV-OC43                                           (OC43) and HCoV-229E       (229E) viruses
are the first                            recorded human coronaviruses.                      In  recent years,
another                  two viruses,                         HCoV-NL63     (NL63)   and HCoV-HKU1      (HKU1),
have been registered. These four viruses usually cause acute
upper respiratory tract infections and are rarely associated
with an upper respiratory tract disorder. Severe diseases are
rare and, as a rule, are associated with concomitant diseases
and/or immunosuppressive conditions.
               Today,               among                viruses      of   the  Enterovirus      genus,   human
rhinoviruses are the biggest problem. Rhinoviruses, which are
replicated in the nasopharyngeal mucosal cells, cause in humans
upper respiratory                                      tract      diseases.    Rhinoviruses     are causative
agents of at least 80% of cold-related diseases. Apart from the
enormous                   economic damage                         (20 million humans/hour         annually in
the           U.S.),               rhinovirus                    infections     cause    a  large   number   of
complications                             such              as   sinusitis     and   otitis    media  and   are
frequently detected in virologic examination of children with
pneumonia. In asthmatic children, rhinovirus infection is also
a cause of acerbations in 80%                                            cases. In adults, rhinovirus may

               Since there are over 100 antigenic types of rhinovirus, it
is impossible to develop an effective vaccine                                                    (Palmenberg, A.

rhinovirus infection.
               Enterovirus                        type       71  (EV71)    was    isolated       for    first      time
from             patients                  with            aseptic    meningitis         and    a  patient         with
encephalitis                          in        California         in    1970-1972       years.     It    should be
noted that in severe cases the virus causes the development of
neurological                            disorders               such    as   meningitis,          paralysis          and
encephalitis. The virus is spread under unsanitary conditions.
After              infection                    with virus          EV71,    the    temperature          increases,
skin rash appears on hands and feet, on the palms and soles,
the extremities become swollen, and ulcers appear in the mouth.
In its severe form, Enterovirus can be fatal. Enterovirus 71 is
reported                    to        be           the      most   "severe"        virus      among      all      human
enteroviruses. This virus can cause large outbreaks with fatal
outcomes.                     There             are no         vaccines     against      Enterovirus          71,    and
non-specific therapy has not yet been developed.
               Coxsackie                     virus          infection      (HCXV)     is    a   large      group      of

are          characterized                              by    high    invasiveness,         which       causes     their
rapid spread                           in        the human population.                  Coxsackie        viruses      are
often             a       cause of                    "sudden"       outbreaks       in   organized         children's
groups                and        hospitals;                     intrafamilial        spread       of    infection      is
registered                      as        well.              A high variability           of     the viral        genome
plays an important role in the epidemiology of Coxsackie virus
and other enterovirus infections. The consequence of this is
the            ability                   of           various         serotypes        to     provoke        different
pathologies in certain circumstances. On the other hand, the
same clinical syndrome may be caused by different serotypes and
different enterovirus species. Genetic variability, selection
and rapid spread of modified viruses result in major disease
outbreaks,                      in        the           etiology       of   which     these     viruses       have    not
previously been                                 involved,            or their      circulation          has   not been
seen for a long time.
               The primary replication of Coxsackie virus occurs in the
nasopharyngeal and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. The virus
causes                 local              lesions               expressed       in    the      symptoms        of   ARD,

               Paramyxoviruses are an important class of viruses that are
associated                      with             respiratory          diseases.   Respiratory-syncytial
virus              (RSV)           is        known           to be a dominant pathogen        of the   lower
respiratory tract throughout the world.
               RSV is an important pathogen in newborns and infants and
is a causative agent of at least 70% of severe viral bronchitis
and/or pneumonias, the majority part of which is characterized
by wheezing and dyspnea. This bronchiolitis is the most common
cause of hospitalization in the winter season during the first
year of child's life. RSV also causes bronchiolitis, pneumonia
and chronic obstructive respiratory disease in humans of all
ages              and          makes                a       significant    contribution     to   an  excess
mortality in the winter season.
               RSV takes a leading position in the number of fatal cases
among viral infections. Only the U.S. spends                                             $2.4 billion on
the treatment of viral diseases of the lower respiratory tract
in children. 50-65% of children under the age of one year old
are infected with this virus, and almost 100% of two-year-old
children are infected. In addition to premature newborns and
older persons, a high-risk group includes persons with diseases
of the cardiovascular, respiratory and immune systems. Based on
published and non-published data, RSV has been calculated to
cause             in        the world                      33.8 millions    of cases  of episodic     acute
infections of the lower respiratory tract                                            (LRTI), wherein 3.4
millions                    of       severe                LRTI   cases  require  hospitalization,       and

infections, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Reinfection with HMPV
occurs                throughout                          adulthood.          The    disease      is     mild      and,    in

elderly people, adults with lung diseases and with a defective
immune system. HMPV outbreaks were registered in hospitals, and

idiopathic pneumonia.
               Among             the            total             number       of    acute     infections            of   the

adults and 30-40%                                     in young children,                 second in frequency only

of parainfluenza viruses                                            (1, 2, 3, 4a, and 4b) isolated from a
human              being.               They               are     not   characterized          by     variability         of
antigenic structure, which is inherent in influenza viruses. In
most patients, parainfluenza proceeds as a short-term                                                               (no more
than 3-6 days) disease without pronounced general intoxication.
However, hypoxia, infection of the lower respiratory tract, and
neurological                           manifestations                       are     frequent       in     children        and
require hospitalization. In addition, the disease may take the
form             of        croup,               bronchiolitis,                  and    pneumonia.         Parainfluenza
viruses of types 1 and 2 most often are associated with croup,
while parainfluenza viruses                                             of types 3 and 4 are considered to
be most pathogenic, they cause bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and

under                one-year                        old           are    especially           sensitive.          In     this
connection, it should be noted that parainfluenza infection is
responsible                        for          significant                mortality        in    young    children        and
immunosuppressed adults since, being complicated with bacterial
infection, parainfluenza is a cause of mortality from the lower
respiratory                          tract                  infections           in     25-30%     of   these        groups.
Reinfection with parainfluenza is possible throughout life.
               The         most          common                  cause    of    catarrhal       inflammation           of  the
upper             respiratory                          tract         is  bacterial        or viral      infection         (for
example, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis,                                                              rhinitis);
thus,             the inflammation of the nasopharyngeal mucous membrane is
most often caused by an infection. This disease also includes
acute and infectious rhinitis and rhinorrhea                                                         (acute rhinitis).
               Nasopharyngitis                                 is    the   most      common     manifestation           of  an
acute              respiratory                             infection          associated        with     limitation         of
activity                      and            needs                 medical       advice.        82%    of      all       acute
nasopharyngitis are caused by rhinoviruses.
               Over the past decade, viruses determining the severity of
acute respiratory diseases with                                                    airway obstruction have been
identified, especially in children in the early years.                                                               Special
attention is paid to the role of respiratory syncytial virus,
metapneumovirus,                                       coronavirus,                bocavirus,        rhinovirus,           and

syndrome.                    Their             role             in   the   development         of   acute     obstructive
syndrome of respiratory tract in children is undeniable;                                                                at the

respiratory tract diseases are often accompanied by bacterial
infection.                       Respiratory                      bacterial           pathogens         are    frequently
present                  in     the           nasopharynx                 in    healthy    people.        Airway      damage
resulting                      from             viral            infection         may    lead      to     an    increased
bacterial                    adhesion                     to the       infected respiratory tract, and to

tonsillitis, which are severe complications.
               In most cases, laryngotracheitis is of infectious nature
it          is         caused                by            viruses         (adenovirus,       influenza            viruses,
parainfluenza                                   viruses)                  or       bacteria           (staphylococcus,

Laryngotracheitis may occur as an independent disease or as a
complication of an inflammatory process in the other parts of
the respiratory tract                                          (rhinitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis, etc.).
               Infectious                           factors             are       important        in      the       disease
development.                         When              viruses         affect      immature     tissue       structures,
chronic                 inflammation in bronchi is                                    possible already in early
childhood.                        Acute                  respiratory             virus    infections           facilitate
secondary bacterial inflammation. Microbial reproduction leads
to         the          progression                          of    inflammation          as   a     result       of      self
destruction                         of          the           bronchial          structure     and       activation          of
enzymes                    of       inflammatory                       cells.        The   consequence           of      these
processes                     is        impaired                 mucociliary           clearance         that     leads      to
panbronchitis                            and            peribronchitis,              mediates      the     formation         of
bronchitis deformans.
               It       should be noted that                                 the   only chemotherapeutic agent
exerting some beneficial effects                                                   in infections          caused by         (+)

relatively toxic drug, often causing anemia.                                                         Its main feature
is a long-term deposition in erythrocytes. As a result, traces

 (licensed drug) and other derivatives of nucleoside analogues,
but there is an urgent need for novel, more effective antiviral
agents.
               Frequently,                         respiratory          infections        are   caused by    mixed
infections, i.e., by infectious processes that develop in the

causative agents,                                      such as virus associations, which suggests
the           need            to        develop                 drugs   being     effective       simultaneously
against all these infections.
               Etiologic agents of mixed infections can be microorganisms
of         the          same           family                 or   larger   taxons      and   kingdoms    in  such

anhydrous organic solvent. After that, the resulting glutaric
acid C1-C6 ester                               was entered into reaction with an appropriate
amine in the presence of a condensing agent, preferably 1,1'
carbonyldiimidazole,                                          in an organic solvent.
               Dicarboxylic acid amides comprising in a glutaryl moiety
mono- or dimethyl substituents were prepared by opening a mono
or dimethyl                       substituted glutaric anhydride by stirring thereof
in methanol at room temperature for 24 hours. Then the glutaric
acid mono- or dimethylsubstituted monomethyl ester was entered
into reaction with an appropriate amine in an organic solvent,
preferably                       in        N,N-dimethylformamide,                      in  the    presence       of    a
condensing agent, preferably 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole.
               Dicarboxylic acid amides comprising a hydroxy group, as a
substituent, in a glutaryl moiety in a-position were prepared
by using 5-oxotetrahydrofuran-2-carbonyl chloride prepared from
5-oxotetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic                                                acid   by   the   reaction        with
oxalyl chloride in an organic solvent under cooling, and then
by         the         reaction                    of        5-oxotetrahydrofuran-2-carbonyl               chloride
with an appropriate amine in an organic solvent in the presence
of         potash,                 followed                    by   hydrolysis       of   the    lactone      in    the

               Example 1
               Antiviral activity of the compounds of formula I against
Coxsackie virus in                                       vivo
               In the study a trypsin-dependent strain HCXV A2 was used,
previously                      adapted                    and  causing    death   in   mice  from Coxsackie
virus infection.
               The experiment was carried out in white mice weighing 6 to
7 g. The animals were infected intramuscularly with a dose of
0.1          mL/mouse.                   The             used infectious       dose    causing mortality     in
mice was 1OLD5 o.
               The ability of compounds to provide a therapeutic effect
was determined by the mortality rate of HCXV A2 virus-infected
mice             in        the          experimental                 group   relative      to  the  group    of
untreated animals.
               The studied compounds and placebo were administered orally
according to the treatment regimen. Normal saline solution was
administered                          to mice as                 placebo.    Intact     animals  served   as   a
negative                   control                  and were        hold in    a separate     room under   the
same conditions as the experimental animals.
               For the experiment, groups were formed with 14-15 animals
each. Compounds were administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg of body
weight.                  The        studied                  compounds   were   administered     orally once
daily for 7 days                                  (first administration was made 24 hours after
infection). The animals were monitored for 15 days during which
the animals were weighed and the mortality rate was registered
every day.

               The compounds of general formula I exhibited a protective
effect                 against                  the          experimental     model     of   Coxsackie      virus

average                    life            expectancy              of     the   animals.      Data    for     some

Table 3.
               The antiviral activity of the studied compounds, disclosed
in the example, suggests that these chemical compounds can be
used as effective drugs in Coxsackie enterovirus infection.

               Example 2
               Antiviral activity of the compounds of general formula I
against mouse-adapted RS virus
               Antiviral effectiveness of the chemical compounds against
RSV in an experimental murine model in vivo was determined for
human virus hRSV that was previously adapted to the growth in
mouse lungs. The animals were infected with the virus at a dose
of 0.5              logTCID5 o intranasally                                   under brief           ether anesthesia         in  a
volume                   of          0.05                 ml/mouse.               The        studied       compounds         were
administered                          orally                  once      daily         for     5   days    according     to     the
treatment                       regimen                       at      a    dose          of      30    mg/kg.     The      first
administration was made 24 hours after infection. Normal saline
solution was administered to mice as placebo.                                                                Intact    animals
served as a negative control and were hold in a separate room
under             the         same            conditions                  as     the      experimental        animals.       Each
experimental group comprised 12 animals. Ribavirin was used as
a reference drug at dose of 40 mg/kg.
               The          antiviral                         activity           of      the      studied    compounds        was
determined by the efficiency in the prevention of weight loss
and          by       suppression                           of    the     reproduction              of hRSV    in  the     mouse
lungs             by measuring                              a   viral       titer         in    the   experimental       groups
relative to the control on days                                                      5 and 7 after infection.
               The         results                 of measuring the body weight in animals                                     for
some particular compounds of formula I                                                            (without any limitation
to the               recited                compounds)                   are      represented          in  Table   4.    In    the
virus control group, the mice showed statistically significant
weight                loss           relative                    to     the       intact         animals.     The  antiviral
activity of the compounds of general formula I was evident in
body weight gain, as compared with the control animals.

respiratory syncytial virus                                       (strain A2,     an infectious titer of
5x106 TCID5 o/mL)                             was assessed in           a Balb/c murine model of viral
pneumonia. The virus was inoculated to animals intranasally in
a volume                    of       50        pL under         brief    ether   anesthesia.    The  immune
response                      in           animals            to    RS     virus     was   suppressed     by
intraperitoneal                                administration           of cyclophosphan      at a dose of
100 mg/kg 5 days before infection. The studied compounds were
administered according to the treatment regimen once daily at a
dose of 30 mg/kg for 5 days, starting 24 hours after infection.
The activity of the compounds was determined by a reduction in
edema of the lung infected with respiratory syncytial virus,
compared to the control, on day 5 after infection.
               The         results                 represented       in   Table   6   for some particular
compounds of general formula I (without any limitation to the
recited compounds) show that infection of the animals with the
virus              led         to       the            formation    of   severe   lung   edema   (3.15-2.05

animals were infected with the virus intranasally under brief
ether anesthesia in a volume of 0.05 ml/mouse.
               To determine the efficiency of the compounds against hRV
in        the        experimental                           model       in    vivo,     the virus           was  previously
titrated in mice, then the mice were infected, and the studied
compounds were                              administered orally. The                           infectious          titer was
assessed                    on       day           4       after       infection         by    titration         of   a  lung

administered                          at         a       dose    of   30   mg/kg of   animal   body     weight.
Intact animals served as a negative control and were kept under
the same conditions as the experimental animals in a separate
room.
               The          antiviral                       activity     of  the   studied    compounds      was
determined on day 4 after infection by a reduction of the virus
infectious activity determined in Hela cell culture.
               The development of the infectious process was associated
with            a reduction                         in       body weight of the animals         in   the virus
control group, wherein the body weight in the mice treated with
the studied compounds of general formula I was higher on days 3
and 4 than the weight of the control animals.
               The          study              of          the   lung   weight   showed    that    during    the
experiment, the lung weight in the infected mice exceeded the
lung            weight              in        the           intact mice,     which was    indicative      of  an
infectious process. The weight of the animal lungs exposed to
the            effect                of          the          studied     compounds    of   formula      I   was
significantly                            different                (was   lower)  from   that   in    the  virus

70-80% mortality                                    in      mice was       10LD50.        Each    group    used   in     the
experiment                      comprised                     20   animals.         Intact       animals     served        as

of         the         compounds                       of    general       formula         I  was    studied    by    oral
administration of the compounds to infected mice once daily at
a      dose          of 30 mg/kg/mouse                             24,    48,     72,    96,    and   120 hours      after
infection                     of        the             animals      with       the    virus.      The    mice   of      the

physiological solution) under the same conditions. The animals
were monitored for 14 days after infection by registration the
mouse death in the groups.
               Each animal was subjected to once-daily observation. The
observation                        included                  the    assessment         of     general    behavior        and
body              condition                     of          animals.       In     days       of   administration           of
preparations,                                  the            observation             was        conducted        before
administration of a preparation in a certain time and about two
hours after administration. The animals were handled according
to the International Standards.
               The activity of the compounds was evaluated by comparing
mortality                      rates                in       the    groups        of    animals       administered           a

               Antiviral activity of the compounds of formula I in the
murine model of experimental herpetic meningoencephalitis
               In the study, herpes simplex virus belonging to antigenic
type             2      was         used.                White    outbred       mice     weighing      7-8  g  were
infected                   i/c          (intracerebrally)                   in   a volume      of   0.05   ml/mouse
comprising a dose of 10LD50. The infectious dose of the virus
that              caused                  100%             mortality         in    mice     was     10LD50.    Each
experimental group comprised 20 mice. Intact animals served as
control                   and        were               hold    in   a    separate       room   under     the  same
conditions as the experimental animals. The antiviral activity
of         the         compounds                      of    general      formula      I   was   studied    by  oral
administration of the compounds to infected mice once daily at
a dose of 30 mg/kg/mouse                                         24,    48,    72,   96,   and 120 hours      after
infection                     of        the            animals     with      the    virus.     The   mice   of  the
control                     group                 were         administered           placebo       (0.2    mL   of
physiological solution) under the same conditions. The animals
were monitored for 14 days after infection by registration the
mouse death in the groups.
               Each animal was subjected to once-daily observation. The
observation                        included the                   assessment        of   general     behavior   and
body condition of animals. The animals were handled according
to the International Standards.
               The activity of the compounds was evaluated by comparing
mortality                      rates               in       the   groups       of   animals       administered     a

I       (without any                          limitation          to    the recited   compounds)  exhibit
anti-inflammatory activity and are therapeutically effective in
the model of nasopharyngitis. The pharmacological action of the

inflammatory changes in the lungs were evaluated by a 5-point
scale, wherein:

carrier                 or an excipient                          suitable for oral,      intramuscular,    or
intravenous administration. The active ingredient can be in a
composition                         with                a    conventional    nontoxic     pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier suitable for the manufacture of solutions,
tablets, pills, capsules, coated pills, and other dosage forms.
               Diverse                compounds                 may  be   used   as   excipients,   such   as
saccharides,                            for              example,     glucose,     lactose,    of   sucrose;

phosphates,                          for             example,       tricalcium      phosphate   or   calcium
hydrogen phosphate. Compounds, which are suitable as a binder,
include starch paste                                        (for example, corn, wheat, rice, or potato
starch),                   gelatin,                     tragacanth,     methylcellulose,      hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose,                                           sodium    carboxymethylcellulose,          and/or
polyvinylpyrrolidone.                                         Optionally    used    disintegrating    agents
include the above-mentioned starches and carboxymethyl starch,
crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar-agar, alginic acid, and
a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate.
               Optional                   additives               include,    for    example,   flowability
control agents and lubricating agents,                                              such as silica, talc,
stearic acid and salts thereof, such as magnesium stearate or
calcium stearate, and/or propylene glycol.
               Stabilizers, thickening agents, colorants, and fragrances
also can be used as additives.
               In a standard dosage form, the amount of an active agent
used in                   combination                       with   a carrier    can   vary depending    on   a
patient under the therapy and on the route of administration of
the therapeutic agent.
               For example, when the compounds are used in the form of
solutions for injection, the active agent in such solutions is
in an amount of 0.01 to 5 wt.%. A diluent may be selected from
a 0.9% sodium chloride solution, distilled water, a Novocain
