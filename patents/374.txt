A MEDICAL DEVICE FOR TEMPORARY DEPLOYMENT INTO A BODILY LUMEN
FIELD
[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to the field of medical devices. Particular
embodiments are related to medical devices that are deployable into bodily lumens including vascular
systems.
BACKGROUND
[0002] A variety of medical devices have been developed for endovascular repair. For instance
various methods and devices have been developed to repair aneurysmal or occluded branches of the
aorta. Devices and techniques have also been developed to bypass or cross-connect between adjacent
arteries or other channels of the body. For instance, anastomosis procedures to join two or more
arteries to that branch from the aortic arch are known. Commonly such techniques involve clamping
and partial or total occlusion of aortic blood vessels. The resultant interruption of blood flow increases
stress on the heart, potentially causing cardiac morbidity. Occlusion of blood flow also can lead to
ischemia for downstream organs and extremities potentially leading to other complications.
Furthermore, the act of placing occlusive clamps across diseased blood vessels risks injury because the
aorta itself is often diseased. In addition, plaque along the arterial wall is potentially disturbed to
embolise, which is highly undesirable.
[0003] There is a need to provide improved medical devices that facilitate the continuation of blood
flow during bypass or anastomosis procedures. There is also a need for medical devices that
ameliorate at least some of the disadvantages associated with existing procedures, including those
mentioned above.
[0004] Throughout this specification, the term "distal" with respect to a portion of the aorta means the
end of the aorta further away in the direction of blood flow from the heart and the term "proximal"
means the portion of the aorta nearer to the heart in the direction of blood flow. When applied to other
vessels, similar terms such as caudal and cranial should be understood.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0046] Referring to Figures 1 to 4, a medical device 100 according to an embodiment of the invention
is shown. The medical device 100 is temporarily deployable into a bodily lumen such as an artery.
[0047] The medical device 100 comprises a guide wire cannula 110 having a proximal end 105 and a
distal end 195. The guide wire cannula 110 may be made from a flexible thin-walled metal tube.
Biocompatible metals such as stainless steel or nitinol may be used. A tip 120 is attached to the
proximal end 105 of the guide wire cannula 110. The tip 120 is atraumatic and may be formed from
soft nylon or radiopaque urethane material. The tip 120 can be described as a dilator tip as its shape
allows it to dilate a vessel as it is advanced through the vessel along a guide wire. The shape also
facilitates entry (for instance though the femoral artery). As can be seen in Figures 1 and 1B, for
instance, the tip 120 is conical and tapers inwards towards the guide wire in a proximal direction.
[0048] Figure 1B is a detailed view of an example of the tip 120 and the proximal end 105 of the
guide wire cannula. The conical tip 120 is secured to the guide wire cannula 110 using an attacher 122.
Gluing or moulding methods may be employed.
[0049] A pusher 130, having a proximal and distal end 131,139 also forms part of the medical device
100. The pusher 130 has a through bore 135 disposed around the guide wire cannula 110. This is most
clearly shown in the two cross-sectional views of Figure 1 and Figure 1A. In particular Figure 1A, a
cross-sectional view through section lA-lA shown on Figure 1, clearly shows the pusher 130 around
the guide wire cannula 110. The through bore 135 is also clearly illustrated in Figure 1A. The internal
diameter of the through bore 135 can be varied with respect to the external diameter of the guide wire
cannula 110 to provide differing levels of clearance.
[0050] The pusher 130 illustrated is "thick walled", that is the thickness of its wall is several times
greater than that of the guide wire cannula 110. In some instances, the pusher 130 and the guide wire
cannula 110 are the same component, having different outer diameters at the location at which a
temporary stent assembly is to be carried.
[0051] The medical device 100 also includes a temporary stent assembly 150, which is also shown in
Figures I to 4. The temporary stent assembly 150 is perhaps most clearly shown in Figures 2, 2A and
2B. As can be seen in these figures, the temporary stent assembly 150 has a proximal end 151 attached
to the tip 120 and a distal end 169 attached to the proximal end 131 of the pusher 130.
[0052]    The temporary stent assembly 150 has a covered portion 160. The covered portion 160, most
clearly shown in Figure 2, has a proximal sealing zone 153, a distal sealing zone 163 and a recess 165
between the proximal and distal sealing zones 153,163.

                                                    7
[0053] The temporary stent assembly 150 includes the plurality of proximal connecting lines 152
extending from the tip 120 to the covered portion 160 and a plurality of distal connecting lines 162
extending from the cupboard portion 160 to the pusher 130. The connecting lines 152,162 are made
from nitinol in the embodiment illustrated. In other embodiments, the lines may be made from any
suitable biocompatible material. These materials could include stainless steel, cobalt-chromium or
tungsten.
[0054] The proximal connecting lines 152 maybe connected to the tip 120 in any suitable way. For
instance, they may be crimped into a metal ring 124 (swaged) onto the guide wire cannula 110 as is
shown in Figure lB. The tip may be moulded over the guide wire cannula 110, the connector 122 and
the metal ring 124..
[0055] Referring to Figure 2, together with Figures 2A and 2B, it can be seen that the covered portion
160 includes a woven metal section comprising self-expanding supports 167 and 168. These self
expanding supports are nitinol wires in the embodiment illustrated. In other embodiments other
materials can be used. The self-expanding supports are adjacent to or integrated with the blood
impermeable material 161. The blood impermeable material can include polytetrafluoroethylene,
Dacron, polyamide ThoralonTM, silicone or any other suitable biocompatible graft material. The blood
impermeable material need only be partially impermeable to blood given that the device is designed
for temporary deployments. That is, the material need only be blood impermeable from a practical
perspective. Small amounts of blood leakage may be permissible for many uses. The blood
impermeability is important however to ensure that there is not massive blood flow through the
cupboard portion between the proximal sealing zone 153 and the distal sealing zone 163.
[0056] The wires may be embedded in the material of the covered portion 160 by casting over the
wires. Alternatively, the material of the covered portion 160 may be woven through the wires. In
alternative embodiments, the material could be sutured to the wires.
[0057] The recess 165, most clearly shown in Figures 2 and 9B, is shaped such that, in use, within an
artery, such as the common carotid artery 30 illustrated in Figure 9B, a pocket 35 is formed between
the proximal and distal sealing zones 153 and 163 of the covered portion 160.
[0058] The recess 165 allows the temporary stent assembly 150 to be spaced away from a target
anastomosis location, thereby allowing a incision to be made and an anastomosis stent to be sutured in
place without undue interference from the temporary stent assembly 150. As described above, the
covered portion 160 includes a woven metal section. This woven metal section protects the covered
portion from excessive damage that may arise from accidental scalpel contact.

                                                      8
[0059] Referring to Figures 2A and 2B, taken through section lines to 2A-2A and 2B-2B respectively
shown on Figure 2, it can be seen that the proximal sealing zone has a first minimum perimeter 153p
and the recess 165 has a second minimum perimeter 165p shorter than the first minimum perimeter
153p. This facilitates the creation of the recess 165.
[0060] The temporary stent assembly 150 may include markers such as gold to aid visibility of key
features under x-ray fluoroscopy. The temporary stent assembly 150 may also include tactile markers
such as raised sections at the bounds of the recess 165 to allow the physician to see the placement of
the device from the outer surface of the target vessel.
[0061] The temporary stent assembly 150 is longitudinally stretchable from a deployable position,
such as the position shown in Figure 2, to a re-sheathable position, such as the position shown in
Figures 3 and 4. Referring to Figure 3, it can be seen that the distance between the tip 120 and the
proximal end 131 has been increased. This increase in length stretches the temporary stent assembly
150 making it easier to re-sheath. Figure 4 shows the temporary stent assembly 150 re-sheathed.
[0062] Returning to Figure 1, it can be seen that the medical device 100 further comprises a sheath
assembly 170 disposed over the pusher 130. The sheath assembly 170 includes a sheath manipulator
175 of the distal end thereof and a sheath 173 extending proximally from the sheath manipulator 175.
The sheath assembly 170 is slidably movable with respect to the pusher 130 from a first position,
shown in Figure 1, in which the sheath 173 covers the temporary stent assembly 150 to a second
position in which at least the covered portion 160 of the temporary stent assembly 150 is uncovered by
the sheath 173 as is shown in Figure 2.
[0063] The sheath assembly includes a haemostatic seal assembly 177 (such as a CaptorTM valve) and
a flushing port 179, both at a distal end thereof. The seal assembly is operable to minimize the egress
of blood from the sheath assembly, while at the same time allowing sliding movement of the pusher
130 with respect to the sheath 173. Disc seals 178a and 178b are shown in Figure 1, however other
types of seals such as wiper seals may be provided.
[0064] A flushing port 179 enables supply of flushing fluid to allow, for instance, flushing with
sterile saline solution between the pusher 130 and the sheath 173 to eliminate air, while the device 100
is outside of the patient.
[0065]     In different embodiments of the medical device, differing arrangements may be used so as to
allow stretching of the temporary stent assembly 150. For instance, with the embodiment shown in
Figures I to 4, the tip 120 is extendable from the pusher 130 so as to stretch the temporary stent
assembly 150. It can be seen from Figures I to 4 that the pusher 130 includes a grippable handle 138

                                                      9
at its distal end 139. Within the grippable handle is a mechanism for selectively holding the guide wire
cannula 110 to the handle 138 and releasing the guide wire cannula 110 from the handle 138. While
various mechanisms may be used, in the embodiment illustrated a pin vice assembly is used. The pin
vice assembly 180 includes a pin vice knob 181 and a pin vice clamp 183. The knob 181 has a screw
thread which engages with a screw thread in the rear of the handle 138. Rotation of the knob 181
causes the knob 181 to engage against a clamp member 183 and this in turn causes the clamp member
183 to clamp against the outer rigid tube that forms the guide wire cannula 110. This prevents
movement of the guide wire cannula 110 with respect to the handle 138.
[0066] A Luer lock connector 115 is also shown in Figures I to 4. The Luer lock connector 115
allows flushing with sterile saline solution to eliminate air while the device 100 is outside of the
patient.
[0067] A second embodiment of the invention is shown in Figures 5 to 8. This second embodiment of
the invention is, in many respects, similar to the first embodiment of the invention, but the
arrangement for longitudinally stretching the temporary stent assembly 150, 250 from a deployable
position to a receivable position is different. With the second embodiment of the invention, the
medical device 200 does not rely on the tip 220 being extendable from the pusher 230 to stretch the
temporary stent assembly 250. Instead, a line manipulator 290 is provided. The line manipulator 290 is
located at the distal end 239 of the pusher to 230. The line manipulator 290 is manipulable to pull the
distal lines 262 of the temporary stent assembly 250 in a direction away from the tip 220 so as to
stretch the temporary stent assembly 250.
[0068] Because the medical device 200, according to the second embodiment of the invention, does
not rely on the tip 220 being extendable from the pusher 230 to stretch the temporary stent assembly
250, a pin vice assembly 280 (and its pin vice 283 and associated pin vice clamp) shown in Figure 5 is
not essential. Figure 5A shows the medical device 200 without a pin vice assembly 280. Instead, a
permanent retainer 284 is provided. This retainer 284 can be moulded into the handle 238 or attached
in other ways.
[0069] Referring now to Figure 5B, a diagrammatic cross-sectional view taken through section lines
5B-5B shown on Figure 5A, it can be seen that the distal lines 262 of the temporary stent assembly
250 pass through a through bore 235 disposed around the guide wire cannula 210.
[0070] The line manipulator 290 is lockable in a deploying position in which the temporary stent
assembly 250 is not stretched. Figures 5, 5A and 6 show the line manipulator 290 in its deploying
position. Detent grooves 294 interact with proximal detent protrusion 293 to hold the line manipulator
290 in this position. An optional line manipulator lock 292 is also provided to prevent inadvertent

                                                     10
movement of the line manipulator. Figure 7 shows the line manipulator 290 in a re-sheathable position
in which the temporary stent assembly 250 is stretched. Again, in this position the detent groove 294 is
engaged with the distal detent protrusion 298.
[0071] Now referring to Figure 8, the device 200 is shown in its retracted position, the sheath
assembly 270 having been moved in a proximal direction away from the handle 238 such that the
sheath 273 covers the temporary stent assembly 250. The sheath assembly 270 is disposed over the
pusher 230 in the same arrangement of the sheath assembly 170 and pusher 130 of the first
embodiment described above. The sheath assembly 270 includes a sheath manipulator 275 of the distal
end thereof. The sheath assembly includes a haemostatic seal assembly 177 (such as a CaptorTM valve)
and a flushing port 179, both at a distal end thereof.
[0072] A Luer lock connector 215 is also shown in Figures 5 to 8. As for the first embodiment of the
invention, the Luer lock connector 215 allows flushing with sterile saline solution to eliminate air
while the device 200 is outside of the patient.
[0073] The line manipulator 290 described above and illustrated in Figures 5 to 8 is just one example
of a means for pulling the distal lines 262 of the temporary stent assembly 250 in a direction away
from the tip 220 so as to stretch the temporary stent assembly 250. Other manipulators utilising
rotatable components may also be used. For example a screw mechanism may be used to pull the
distal lines 262.
[0074] Use of the device 100 will now be described with reference to Figures 9 to 15. This
description is generally applicable to all of the embodiments of the invention described above, but for
ease of reference will be described specifically for use with the first embodiment of the invention.
[0075] Referring first to Figure 9, the aortic arch of a human is illustrated. The brachiocephalic artery
20, common carotid artery 30, subclavian artery 40 and descending aorta 50 are all shown. A portion
of a first medical device 100, including its tip 120 is shown within the descending aorta 50. A portion
of a second medical device 100', including its tip 120' is shown within the subclavian artery 40.
Deployment of the medical devices 100, 100' illustrated can be achieved using well known surgical
techniques, including those based on the Seldinger wire technique. This technique involves creating a
surgical opening in an artery with a needle or trocar and inserting a wire guide into the artery through
a bore of the needle. The needle can be withdrawn, leaving the wire guide in place.
[0076] Again referring to Figure 9, the medical device 100 may be deployed through an incision in
the femoral artery of the patient. The medical device is inserted over a guide wire (not shown) into the
femoral artery and then is advanced over the guide wire through the position shown in figure 9 to the
position shown in Figure 10.

                                                      11
[0077] Figure 10 is a similar figure to that of 9 but shows further detail of a step of a method of
establishing a bypass graft between two arteries 30 and 40. This step is deploying a first temporary
stent assembly 150 into a first target artery 30, in this case the common carotid artery 30. This first
temporary stent assembly is the stent assembly 150 illustrated in Figures 1 to 4. It has a covered
portion 160 having a first proximal sealing zone 153, a first distal sealing zone 163 and a first recess
165 between the first proximal and distal sealing zones 153,163.
[0078] Figure 10 also shows a step of deploying a second temporary stent assembly 150' into a
second target artery, in this case, the subclavian artery 40. The second temporary stent assembly 150'
has a second covered portion 160' having a second proximal sealing zone 153', a second distal sealing
zone 163' and a second recess 165' between the second proximal and distal sealing zones 153',163'.
[0079] The above two steps result in the creation of pockets 35 and 45. With the arrangement shown
in Figure 10 and 10A, blood is able to flow through gaps between the lines of the stent assemblies and
along the inside of a lumen formed within the covered portion 160 out through the proximal lines 152.
At the same time the pocket 35 is sealed off from blood flow. This enables the installation of a
anastomosis stent 70 between the first and second target arteries 30,40 as is shown progressively in
Figures 11 and 12.
[0080] Referring again to Figure 11, incisions 32 and 42 are made to allow fluid communication from
artery 30 to artery 40 through anastomosis stent 70.
[0081] Once the anastomosis 70 is in place, the first and second temporary stent assemblies 150,150'
can be retrieved, as is illustrated in Figures 13 and 14. The gradual transition in diameter of the
uncovered portion of the temporary stent assembly 150 facilitates re-sheathing with a smooth action
aimed at minimizing plaque displacement from the vessel wall.
[0082] The final arrangement within the anatomy is shown in Figure 15 with the anastomosis stent 70
in place between the common carotid artery 30 and the left subclavian artery 40.
[0083] Throughout this specification various indications have been given as to the scope of this
invention but the invention is not limited to any one of these but may reside in two or more of these
combined together. The examples are given for illustration only and not for limitation.
[0084] Throughout this specification and the claims that follow unless the context requires otherwise,
the words 'comprise' and 'include' and variations such as 'comprising' and 'including' will be
understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any
other integer or group of integers.
