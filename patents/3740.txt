   ASPHALT MIXTURE, PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF SAME, AND PAVING
                                  METHOD USING SAME
TECHNICAL FIELD
       [0001]
      The   present     invention       relates         to  an   asphalt       mixture   to    be
used for road pavement and a process for production of the                                same,
and also relates to a paving method using the same.
BACKGROUND ART
       [0002]
      A   hot   asphalt        mixture     is     usually      used      under     an  initial
compacting     temperature         within       a     range    of    110-140'C,       such     as
provided by Pavement Construction Handbook                         ("Hosou Sekou Binran"
in  Japanese).      However,       even     though       the hot     asphalt      mixture     can
have    a   large    strength        immediately            after      being      paved,      the
available period of time is              until the temperature of the mixture
decreases.        Therefore,         the      application          of     the    hot   asphalt
mixture    may be   difficult       under       various      conditions,         such as   when
a  small    amount    of      the  mixture        is     divided    to      be  used   several
times,    when   the    mixture      is     transported         for     a    long   period     of
time,    and when   the      constructed        thickness       is    thin,     such  as   in    a
thin    layer   overlay        method,      and      the    temperature        significantly
decreases immediately after the mixture is                        spread.
       [0003]
      Accordingly, a hot asphalt mixture that uses a warm-mix
technique and an ordinary temperature construction-type asphalt
mixture are focused.            The hot asphalt mixture that uses a warm
mix technique, i.e.           a warm-mix asphalt mixture, is generally
said to be able to

extend the available                temperature range of the hot                        asphalt
mixture        toward    the     lower      limit       side      by    about      300C.       The
ordinary temperature                construction-type asphalt mixture                            is
an    asphalt        mixture      that     is      said     to      allow      the    pavement
construction            under        ordinary            temperatures              (1000C        or
lower).
          [0004]
         As     an asphalt mixture that can be constructed under
ordinary temperatures or under temperatures within a warm
temperature           region,        for     example,           a    so-called          cutback
asphalt mixture is proposed in which the viscosity of the
asphalt       mixture      is    forcibly         reduced         using      a   mineral       oil
or     the       like.        In     the       cutback         asphalt          mixture,         as
disclosed in JP11-12475A, the asphalt is                                softened using a
cutback       material       such     as   a    mineral       oil,      and     the   strength
of     the      asphalt       mixture         is     developed           as     the     cutback
material          is   volatilized.                However,          according          to     the
method      in    which,     as   described           above,       the    asphalt       is   "cut
back" using a mineral oil or the like thereby to                                      forcibly
reduce          the     viscosity             at       the        time         of     pavement
construction,           there       are    drawbacks            in    that       the    mixture
strength          when   the      traffic         of      a   road       is      opened,       for
example,         may   considerably          deteriorate            and     the    curing      may
require a long time.
          [00051
         An      ordinary       temperature            construction-type                asphalt
mixture       using     an    asphalt       emulsion         is     also     proposed,         but
the mixture has a relatively low strength even though the
aggregate         is not required to be heated and dried, and the
applicable field may be limited because the decomposition
rate     of     the   asphalt       emulsion         may    have       to    be    taken     into
consideration.            In    addition,          in     the    ordinary         temperature
asphalt        mixture      using       an    asphalt        emulsion,           the    asphalt
                                               - 2 -

                                                        3
emulsion         may possibly            flow    out     if     it    rains     before         the       emulsion
is decomposed after the pavement construction.
           [00061
          In    such    a    situation,          JP    Patent         No.      5583978         discloses            an
ordinary         temperature           construction-type                asphalt       mixture           that       can
be      constructed           under        ordinary           temperatures.                  This          asphalt
mixture uses a tall oil fatty acid as the cutback material                                                      (see,
for         example,          "Naval          Stores          -Production-                -Chemistry-
Utilization-"             (published by           Harima           Chemicals        Group,         Inc.,         June
1993),        line 10 of page 474               to line        9 of page 475).                  The tall oil
fatty        acid   acts     to      reduce     the    viscosity            of   the     asphalt          mixture
thereby          to   allow          the     pavement          construction              under           ordinary
temperatures.               According          to    this        technique          of     JP      Patent         No.
5583978,         the  tall       oil    fatty     acid       as     the    cutback       material            reacts
with      the    cement      after      the    pavement          construction           so as         to act        as
a curing agent, which can thereby develop a sufficient strength.
           [0007]
          On    the  other       hand,       also   in      an     asphalt      mixture          that        can    be
constructed          under         ordinary       temperatures               or   under         temperatures
within        a   warm     temperature          region,          the     pavement         body        after        the
construction          is     required         to have        improved         characteristics,                   such
as      further       enhanced            strength,           durability,            and        flexibility.
Therefore, an            asphalt mixture is                 desired which can improve these
characteristics               and      which     can       be      constructed            under          ordinary
temperatures           or     under        temperatures              within      a    warm        temperature

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
           [00081
          The present          invention        provides           an   asphalt       mixture           that       can
develop         the  strength           within     a    relatively            short       time        after        the
pavement          construction             and    can        give       a    pavement           body         having
enhanced           strength            and     durability               and      excellent                in       the
flexibility.

      [0009]
      As   a   result     of    intensive     studies      to    solve    the     above
problems,    the present      inventors have      found that,       when producing
an  asphalt    mixture,     a   lubricative    solidification        material      that
contains    an   oleic    acid     at  a  ratio    of    60   to   85   wt%    and   an
alkaline     additive     material     are   added     to    and   mixed     with    an
aggregate     and   an   asphalt      to  decrease      the    viscosity       of   the
asphalt     thereby    to     allow     the   pavement       construction         under
temperatures      within      a    low   temperature        region     to    ordinary
temperatures      and     further      to    temperatures         within      a    warm
temperature     region     (e.g.    -200C   to  1200C,      preferably      -100C    to
1000C),   while   a hardening       accelerator     is   fed to     the mixture      at
the time of pavement         construction     so that the added lubricative
solidification       material       and    alkaline      component       undergo       a
saponification reaction or a neutralization reaction to increase
the viscosity,     and    the    asphalt   mixture     can   thereby    be provided
which   can   develop   a   certain    strength    within     a relatively        short
time.    The present invention has thus been accomplished.
      In particular, the present inventors have found that, by
using a lubricative solidification material that contains an
oleic acid at a ratio of 60 to 85 wt%, the obtained pavement
body can have enhanced strength and durability and can be
excellent in the flexibility while allowing the pavement
construction under ordinary temperatures or under temperatures
within a warm temperature region.             The present invention has
thus been accomplished.

solidification               material       having        a    low     viscosity           is    added
thereby          to       allow         the       pavement            construction               under
temperatures            within        a  low     temperature           region          to   ordinary

to    1000C),        while      the hardening             accelerator            is     fed     at the
time        of    pavement           construction              so     that        the       alkaline
additive         material         in    the mixture           is    ionically            decomposed

neutralization                    reaction              with            the            lubricative
solidification               material,        and     a  high      strength            can    thus  be

enhanced         strength          and    durability           and     which        is    excellent
in        the       flexibility             while          allowing             the         pavement

            The       asphalt           mixture       according           to     the    present
invention             is      configured          to      contain         an     asphalt,       an
aggregate,            a   lubricative         solidification              material,      and    an
alkaline            additive         material.          The      microstructure          of    the
asphalt          mixture         is     considered         as    follows.         That     is,    a
lubrication                 film         configured             of      the        lubricative
solidification                material       having        a    low    viscosity       and     the
alkaline           additive          material      appears         to    be    present      among
aggregates            formed         thereon    with        asphalt       coatings      thereby
to      develop         some       lubrication          effect.           This     allows      the
pavement            body       before       the      saponification              reaction       or
neutralization                 reaction       to     remain        in     a    low   viscosity
state.            In    other        words,    in     the      present       invention,        the
lubricative              solidification              material          acts,      before       the
pavement construction, as                      a cutback material that                  reduces
the      viscosity          of     the    asphalt       mixture        under     temperatures
within         a   low    temperature         region         to   ordinary       temperatures
and       further         to    temperatures           within        a   warm      temperature
region         (e.g. -20'C to 1200C, preferably -10'C to 1000C).

            After        such       an    asphalt       mixture         according       to     the
present          invention          is   used   for pavement             construction,         the
hardening accelerator                     (e.g. water) is            sprayed thereon and
compaction is performed using a roller.                                    Otherwise, after
compaction             using         a   roller,        the      hardening         accelerator
 (e.g.        water)       is     sprayed.          This       allows       the    lubricative
solidification                material        and      alkaline         additive      material
contained              in       the       asphalt          mixture          to     undergo        a

the     hardening           accelerator         (e.g.       water),       and    the  strength
can thus be enhanced.                      When performing pavement using the

beating      may     also    be     employed,            for   example,     depending       on
the purpose of pavement.

           First, an aggregate is put                        into a mixing apparatus,
and     dry mixing            for     the      aggregate       is    performed.              The      dry
mixing        may     be     performed          under     a    condition         in      which        the
aggregate          is     heated         to    100-170'C,         preferably            100-140'C,
and     more     preferably              110-1300C.          The     temperature             and      the
amount        of    time       for      the    dry   mixing        are     not     particularly
limited,         but        the     temperature           for       the     dry      mixing           may
ordinarily            be    100-1400C           and   preferably           110-1300C,            while
the     amount        of    time      for     the   dry mixing            may   ordinarily             be
about       1   second        to    1    minute.       In     the     present        embodiment,
the aggregate              is used in the state of being heated to the
above        temperature              thereby       to      allow       the     water           amount
contained         in     the     aggregate         to be      controlled,            so that          the
preservation             stability            of   the     obtained         asphalt          mixture

           Asphalt is           then added to the mixing apparatus to be
mixed       with       the      aggregate.            In     the     present         embodiment,
after       being       heated         to     130-1700C       and     preferably             to     140
1600C,        the     asphalt        is    added     to the       mixing      apparatus,              and
the       mixing         of      the         aggregate         and        asphalt          is       then
conducted.            The mixing temperature and mixing time during
this      operation          are     not particularly               limited       if     a    certain

condition          is    obtained        such       that      the    asphalt        layer        is
uniformly formed on the                   aggregate surface, but the mixing
temperature            may   ordinarily           be     100-140'C        and    preferably
110-130'C,          while    the mixing           time     may ordinarily           be    about
1 second to 5 minutes.
            [00381
           Subsequently, a            lubricative           solidification material
is    added       to    the   mixing       apparatus          to   be     mixed     with      the
mixture         obtained      in    the      above       manner.         The    lubricative
solidification              material            may       be      used       at      ordinary
temperatures,             but    may     preferably            be    used     after       being
heated        to about      15-25'C,        such      as   during       the   cold months.
The     mixing       temperature          and     the     mixing      time     during       this
operation           are    also     not      particularly            limited,        but      the
mixing         temperature          may       ordinarily           be      100-140'C          and
preferably             110-1300C,          while          the      mixing         time        may
ordinarily be about 1 second to 5 minutes.
            [00391
           Thereafter,         an   alkaline          additive       material       is    added
to    the      mixing      apparatus          to    be     mixed     with      the     mixture
obtained in the above manner.                          The mixing temperature                 and
the        mixing         time      during           this        operation         are        not
particularly             limited,       but       the      mixing        temperature          may
ordinarily           be   100-1400C        and      preferably          110-1300C,        while
the     mixing        time   may     ordinarily           be    about      1  second       to     5

«Second Embodiment
        In        an     alternative           embodiment           of    the     present
invention,           the    mixture         to     be     obtained      in    the    above
process may be configured such that                          the alkaline additive
material       is     added    thereto,         in    addition      to   the   hardening
accelerator              (e.g.        water),           when       the       lubricative
solidification            material         and     the     alkaline     component       are
subjected            to      a       saponification                reaction        or     a
neutralization reaction.
         [0046]
        In this case,            the     above-described alkaline                additive
material may be used as the alkaline additive material to
                                             - 20 -

be added with the hardening accelerator, for example, but
it      is       particularly          preferred               to         use      potassium
pyrophosphate.
          [0047]
         According to the present embodiment, by employing a
configuration         in   which     the    alkaline          additive           material   is
added     in    addition     to   the     hardening           accelerator           when   the
lubricative          solidification           material            and         the    alkaline
component are         subjected to a saponification reaction or a
neutralization            reaction,        the        ratio         of        the    alkaline
additive       material     to be      contained          in    the       asphalt      mixture
can    be    suppressed      to   a   low    value       thereby            to   enhance   the
preservation          stability        of     the       asphalt            mixture.        For
example, in this           case, the ratio of the alkaline additive
material       in   the   asphalt      mixture        may     preferably           be within
a   range        of   100:1      to     100:10         as      a    weight         ratio    of
"lubricative          solidification            material:alkaline                    additive
material".            Otherwise,          in     this         case,           the    alkaline
additive       material     may     not    be   added        at     all.         Further,   in
this case,        if the ratio of the              alkaline additive material
in the asphalt mixture is                suppressed to               a low value, then
it  is    possible       even   to use      a   bag      that      does        not  have   any
moisture       permeation       preventing           layer       or       a   bag   that   has
less      sealing      property        as     the      bag       for         enclosing     the
asphalt        mixture.         In     addition,             the       asphalt         mixture
according         to   the    present         embodiment             has        an   enhanced
initial       strength      compared        with       that       of        a   conventional
ordinary        temperature       mixture        packed          in      a    bag,    and  the
strength is developed at an early stage.
