                           RELATED APPLICATIONS
         [0001] This patent claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application
Serial No. 61/786,228, titled "METHODS AND APPARATUS TO
CONTROL AN ARCHITECTURAL OPENING COVERING ASSEMBLY,"
filed on March 14, 2013, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in
its entirety.
                          FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
         [0002] This disclosure relates generally to architectural opening
covering assemblies and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus to
control an architectural opening covering assembly.
                                 BACKGROUND
         [0003] Architectural opening covering assemblies such as roller blinds
provide shading and privacy. Such assemblies generally include a motorized
roller tube connected to covering fabric or other shading material. As the
roller tube rotates, the fabric winds or unwinds around the tube to uncover or
cover an architectural opening.

         [0004] FIG. 1 is an isometric illustration of an example architectural
opening covering assembly in which aspects of the present disclosure may be
implemented.
         [0005] FIG. 2 is a side, schematic view of an example first
architectural opening covering assembly and an example second architectural
                                        -1-

opening covering assembly having coverings at the same speed setting
position.
         [0006] FIG. 3 is a side, schematic view of the example first
architectural opening covering assembly and the example second architectural
opening covering assembly of FIG. 2 having coverings at different speed
setting positions.

controller of FIG. 4.
         [0010] The figures are not to scale. Instead, to clarify multiple layers
and regions, the thickness of the layers may be enlarged in the drawings.
Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the
drawing(s) and accompanying written description to refer to the same or like
parts. As used in this patent, stating that any part (e.g., a layer, film, area, or
plate) is in any way positioned on (e.g., positioned on, located on, disposed on,
or formed on, etc.) another part, means that the referenced part is either in
contact with the other part, or that the referenced part is above the other part
with one or more intermediate part(s) located therebetween. Stating that any
part is in contact with another part means that there is no intermediate part
between the two parts.
                          DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         [0011] Methods and apparatus to control an architectural opening
covering assembly are disclosed herein. An example method disclosed herein
includes determining, via a processor, a position of a covering of an
                                        -2-

architectural opening covering assembly, and determining a speed at which the
covering is to move via a motor based on the position and a period of time.
The example method also includes operating the motor to move the covering
at the speed.
         [0012] An example tangible computer readable storage medium
disclosed herein includes instructions that, when executed, cause a machine to
at least determine a distance between a portion of a covering of an
architectural opening covering assembly from a reference position and
determine a speed at which the covering is to move via a motor based on the
distance and a period of time. The example instructions also cause the
machine to at least operate the motor to move the portion of the covering at
the speed.
         [0013] An example apparatus disclosed herein includes a motor
operatively coupled to a rotary component of an architectural opening
covering assembly. The example rotary component is operatively coupled to
an architectural opening covering. The example apparatus also includes a
sensor to determine an angular position of the rotary component. The example
apparatus further includes a controller to determine a speed at which the motor
is to rotate the rotary component based on the angular position of the rotary
component and a period of time. The architectural opening covering is to raise
or lower when the motor rotates the rotary component.
         [0014] An example controller of an architectural opening covering
assembly is disclosed herein. The example architectural opening covering
assembly includes a motor to rotate a rotary component of the architectural
opening covering assembly operatively coupled to a covering. The example
controller includes a motor controller to control the motor. The example
controller also includes a angular position determiner to determine an angular
position of the rotary component. The example controller further includes a
rotational speed determiner to determine a speed at which the motor is to
rotate the rotary component based on a period of time and the angular position
of the rotary component relative to a reference position.

        [0023] In one embodiment, there is provided asystem including:
                a first architectural opening covering assembly to:
                                  identify a first position of the first covering as a

        [0024] In one embodiment, there is provided a method comprising:
        in response to a first command to store a speed at which an
architectural opening covering assembly is to be driven via a motor:
                         identifying, with a logic circuit, a current position of the
                 covering;
                         determining, with the logic circuit, a distance between
                 the current position of the covering and a reference position;
                         calculating, with the logic circuit, the speed at which the
                 covering is to be driven by dividing the distance by an amount
                 of time in which the covering is to travel the distance; and
                         storing, with the logic circuit, the speed at which the
                 covering is to be driven; and
        in response to a second command to move the covering, operating the
motor to move the covering at the stored speed.
        [0025] In one embodiment, there is provided a tangible computer
readable storage medium comprising instructions which, when executed, cause
a logic circuit to at least:
        in response to a first command to store a speed at which an
architectural opening covering assembly is to be driven via a motor:
                         identify a current position of the covering;
                                         -8-

                        determine a distance between the current position of the
                covering and a reference position;
                        calculate the speed at which the covering is to be driven
                by dividing the distance by an amount of time in which the
                covering is to travel the distance; and
                        store the speed at which the covering is to be driven;
                and
        in response to a second command to move the covering, operate the
motor to move the covering at the stored speed
        [0026] Example architectural opening covering assemblies disclosed
herein may be controlled by one or more controllers. In some examples, a
controller is communicatively coupled to a motor, which rotates a rotary
component of the architectural opening covering assembly such as, for
example, a tube, an output shaft of a motor, a lead screw, a wheel and/or any
other component that rotates to raise or lower a covering. The example
controllers disclosed herein control speeds at which the coverings move via
the motors based on visual appearances of the architectural opening covering
assemblies during a speed setting mode. For example, some example
controllers disclosed herein enable the speeds at which the coverings are
moved via the motors (e.g., rotational speeds at which motors rotate tubes to
wind or unwind the coverings) to be established (e.g., determined and/or set)
based on a position of the covering relative to a reference position (e.g., a fully
unwound position of the covering, a lower limit position of the covering, an
upper limit position of the covering, etc.). When some example controllers
disclosed herein are in the speed setting mode, the positions of the coverings
may be individually adjusted via input devices to desired positions (e.g., speed
setting positions). For example, the position of the covering may be adjusted
by control of the motor, operation of manual controls such as pull cords,
physically positioning the covering by raising or pulling on the covering, and
so forth. Based on the desired positions of the coverings, the controllers
determine and/or set the speeds at which the motors are to move the coverings.
                                        -9-

         [0027] For example, if each of the coverings are moved to
substantially the same position (e.g., a given distance from the fully unwound
positions of the coverings), the controllers establish substantially the same
speed at which the coverings are to move during operation (e.g., even if, for
example, the tubes on which the coverings are wound are different sizes). In
this manner, a plurality of example architectural opening covering assemblies
disclosed herein may be coordinated to move their coverings in unison. In
some examples, if the positions of the coverings are moved to different
positions, the controllers establish different speeds at which the motors are to
move the rotary component (e.g., tubes, lead screws, shafts, wheels, and/or
additional and/or alternative rotary components) and, thus, the coverings
during operation. For example, if a first covering is moved to a first position
that is three times as far from a reference position as a second position of a
second covering, the motor operatively coupled to the first covering may move
the first covering three times faster than a motor operatively coupled to the
second covering.
         [0028] FIG. 1 is an isometric illustration of an example architectural
opening covering assembly 100 in accordance with the teachings of this
disclosure. The example architectural opening covering assembly 100 of FIG.
1 is merely an example and, thus, other architectural opening covering
assemblies may be used to implement the example methods and/or apparatus
disclosed herein. For example, the architectural opening covering assemblies
described in the following applications may be used: U.S. Provisional
Application Serial No. 61/542,760, entitled "CONTROL OF
ARCHITECTURAL OPENING COVERINGS," filed October 3, 2011; U.S.
Provisional Application Serial No. 61/648,011, entitled "METHODS AND
APPARATUS TO CONTROL ARCHITECTURAL OPENING COVERING
ASSEMBLIES," filed May 16, 2012; International Application No.
PCT/US2012/000428, entitled "METHODS AND APPARATUS TO
CONTROL ARCHITECTURAL OPENING COVERING ASSEMBLIES,"
filed on October 3, 2012; and U.S. International Application No.
PCT/US2012/000429, entitled "METHODS AND APPARATUS TO
                                        - 10 -

CONTROL ARCHITECTURAL OPENING COVERING ASSEMBLIES,"
filed on October 3, 2012, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated
herein by reference in their entirety.   In the example of FIG. 1, the covering
assembly 100 includes a headrail 108. The headrail 108 is a housing having
opposed end caps 110, 111 joined by front 112, back 113 and top sides 114 to
form an open bottom enclosure. The headrail 108 also has mounts 115 for
coupling the headrail 108 to a structure above or behind an architectural
opening such as a wall via mechanical fasteners such as screws, bolts, etc. A
roller tube 104 is disposed between the end caps 110, 111. Although a
particular example of a headrail 108 is shown in FIG. 1, many different types
and styles of headrails exist and could be employed in place of the example
headrail 108 of FIG. 1. Indeed, if the aesthetic effect of the headrail 108 is not
desired, it can be eliminated in favor of mounting brackets.
         [0029] In the example illustrated in FIG. 1, the architectural opening
covering assembly 100 includes a covering 106, which is a cellular type of
shade. In this example, the covering 106 includes a unitary flexible fabric
(referred to herein as a "backplane") 116 and a plurality of cell sheets 118 that
are secured to the backplane 116 to form a series of cells. The cell sheets 118
may be secured to the backplane 116 using any desired fastening approach
such as adhesive attachment, sonic welding, weaving, stitching, etc. The
covering 106 shown in FIG. 1 can be replaced by any other type of covering
including, for instance, single sheet shades, blinds (e.g., Venetian blinds),
other cellular coverings, sheers, honeycombs, shutters, and/or any other type
of covering. In the illustrated example, the covering 106 has an upper edge
mounted to the roller tube 104 and a lower, free edge. The upper edge of the
example covering 106 is coupled to the roller tube 104 via a chemical fastener
(e.g., glue) and/or one or more mechanical fasteners (e.g., rivets, tape, staples,
tacks, etc.). The covering 106 is movable between a raised position and a
lowered position (illustratively, the position shown in FIG. 1). When in the
raised position, the covering 106 is wound about the roller tube 104. In some
examples, the architectural opening covering assembly 100 is implemented
without the tube 104. For example, the covering 106 may be coupled to a
                                       - 11 -

rotary component such as, for example, a lead screw, a wheel, a shaft, and/or
additional and/or alternative rotary components employed to raise and/or
lower the covering 106. In some such examples, the rotary component(s) raise
and/or lower the covering 106 by releasing and/or retracting one or more
strings and/or cables coupled to the covering 106.
         [0030] The example architectural opening covering assembly 100 is
provided with a motor 120 to move the covering 106 between the raised and
lowered positions. The example motor 120 is controlled by a controller 122.
In the illustrated example, the controller 122 and the motor 120 are disposed
inside the tube 104 and communicatively coupled via a wire 124.
Alternatively, the controller 122 and/or the motor 120 may be disposed outside
of the tube 104 (e.g., mounted to the headrail 108, mounted to the mounts 115,
located in a central facility location, etc.) and/or communicatively coupled via
a wireless communication channel. As described in greater detail below, the
example controller 122 controls speeds at which the covering 106 moves
relative to an architectural opening.
         [0031] The example architectural opening covering assembly 100 of
FIG. 1 includes a tube angular position sensor 126 communicatively coupled
to the controller 122. In the illustrated example, the tube angular position
sensor 126 is a gravitational sensor (e.g., an accelerometer, the gravitational
sensor made by Kionix® as part number KXTC9-2050, etc.). In other
examples, the tube angular position sensor may include one or more other
types of sensors (e.g., a potentiometer, a Hall Effect type sensor, a resolver, a
rotary encoder employing, for example, light, a magnet, and/or any other type
of angular position sensor). The example tube angular position sensor 126 of
FIG. 1 is coupled to the tube 104 via a mount 128 to rotate with the tube 104.
In some examples, the tube angular position sensor 126 is coupled to one or
more additional and/or alternative rotary components of the example
architectural opening covering assembly 100 such as, for example, a shaft of
the motor 120. In the illustrated example, the tube angular position sensor 126
is disposed inside the tube 104 along an axis of rotation 130 of the tube 104
such that an axis of rotation of the tube angular position sensor 126 is
                                        - 12  -

substantially coaxial to the axis of rotation 130 of the tube 104. In the
illustrated example, a central axis of the tube 104 is substantially coaxial to the
axis of rotation 130 of the tube 104, and a center of the tube angular position
sensor 126 is on (e.g., substantially coincident with) the axis of rotation 130 of
the tube 104. In other examples, the tube angular position sensor 126 is
disposed in other locations such as, for example, on an interior surface 132 of
the tube 104, on an exterior surface 134 of the tube 104, on an end 136 of the
tube 104, on the covering 106, and/or any other suitable location. The
example tube angular position sensor 126 generates tube position information,
which is used by the controller 122 to determine an angular position of the
tube 104 and/or monitor movement of the tube 104 and, thus, the covering
106. In some examples, the tube position information includes values
corresponding to a position of the covering 106. In some examples, the
controller 122 controls an angular position of the tube 104 and/or a speed of
rotation of the tube 104 based on the tube position information.
         [0032] In some examples in which the tube position sensor 126 is
operatively coupled to a rotary component (e.g., a shaft, a lead screw, a wheel,
and/or any other rotary component) other than the tube 104, the tube angular
position sensor 126 generates position information on the rotary component.
In some such examples, the controller 122 determines an angular position of
the rotary component and/or monitors movement of the covering 106 based on
the position information generated by the tube position sensor 126. In some
such examples, the controller 122 controls an angular position of the rotary
component and/or a speed of rotation of the rotary component by controlling
the motor 120 based on the position information.
         [0033] In some examples, the architectural opening covering assembly
100 is operatively coupled to an input device 138, which may be used to
automatically and/or selectively move the covering 106 between the raised and
lowered positions. In some examples, the input device 138 sends a signal to
the controller 122 to enter a programming mode (e.g., a speed setting mode) in
which a speed of rotation of the tube 104 is determined, set and/or recorded.
In some examples, one or more positions (e.g., a lower limit position, an upper
                                       - 13 -

limit position, a position between the lower limit position and the upper limit
position, etc.) of the covering 106 are determined and/or recorded when the
controller 122 enters the program mode. In the case of an electronic signal,
the signal may be sent via a wired or wireless connection.
         [0034]   In some examples, the input device 138 is a mechanical input
device such as, for example, a cord, a lever, a crank, and/or an actuator
coupled to the motor 120 and/or the tube 104 to apply a force to rotate the tube
104. In some examples, the input device 138 is implemented by the covering
106 and, thus, the input device 138 is eliminated (e.g., the covering 106 is
lowered by pulling the covering 106 downward and the covering 106 is raised
by lifting the covering 106). In some examples, the input device 138 is an
electronic input device such as, for example, a switch, a light sensor, a
computer, a central controller, a smartphone, and/or any other device capable
of providing instructions to the motor 120 and/or the controller 122 to raise or
lower the covering 106. In some examples, the input device 138 is a remote
control, a smart phone, a laptop, and/or any other portable communication
device, and the controller 122 includes a receiver to receive signals from the
input device 138.    Some example architectural opening covering assemblies
include other numbers of input devices (e.g., 0, 2, etc.).
         [0035] In some examples, the input device 138 is disposed on the
architectural opening covering assembly 100. In other examples, the input
device 138 is not disposed on the architectural opening covering assemblyl00
(e.g., the input device 138 is disposed in a control room of a building in which
the architectural opening covering assembly 100 is employed) and is remotely
communicatively coupled to the controller 122 via, for example, wires, a
wireless transmitter, and/or other manner. The example architectural opening
covering assembly 100 may include any number and combination of input
devices.
         [0036] In some examples, a speed at which the covering 106 is raised
and/or lowered via the motor 120 is determined, set and/or recorded (e.g.,
stored in a memory) during a speed setting mode (e.g., a programming or
calibration mode). The example controller 122 of FIG. 1 enters the speed
                                       - 14 -

setting mode in response to a first command from the input device 138. When
the example controller 122 is in the speed setting mode, a user may move
(e.g., raise or lower) the covering 106 to a desired position (e.g., a speed
setting position) a given distance away from a reference position such as, for
example, a fully unwound position, a lower limit position, an upper limit
position, a previously stored position, and/or any other position. In some
examples, the reference position is determined during the speed setting mode.
In other examples, the reference position is previously determined and/or
recorded during, for example, a programming mode described in U.S.
Provisional Application Serial No. 61/648,011, International Application No.
PCT/US2012/000428, and/or U.S. International Application No.
PCT/US2012/000429. In the illustrated example, the example controller 122
monitors the angular positions of the tube 104 based on the tube position
information generated by the example tube angular position sensor 126 to
determine the position of the covering 106 as the covering 106 is moved to the
speed setting position.
         [0037] In response to a second command from the input device 138,
the example controller 122 establishes (e.g., determines, sets and/or records) a
speed at which the motor 120 is to rotate the tube 104 based on the speed
setting position of the covering 106. In some examples, the rotational speed of
the tube 104 is determined by dividing a number of rotations of the tube 104
from the reference position to the speed setting position by a predetermined
value. For example, the predetermined value may be an amount of time over
which the covering 106 is to move the distance from the reference position to
the speed setting position (e.g., ten seconds, twenty seconds, etc). For
example, if the speed setting position is ten revolutions of the tube 104 away
from the reference position and the predetermined amount of time is 15
seconds, the controller 122 determines, sets and/or stores the rotational speed
at which the motor 120 is to rotate the tube 104 to be ten revolutions per
fifteen seconds (i.e., 40 revolutions per minute). As a result, during operation
of the example architectural opening covering assembly 100 of FIG. 1, the
                                        - 15 -

example covering 106 raises and/or lowers at a speed corresponding to 40
revolutions of the tube 104 per minute.
         [0038] FIG. 2 is a side, schematic view of a first architectural opening
covering assembly 200 and a second architectural opening covering assembly
202 disclosed herein. The example architectural opening covering assembly
200 and/or the example architectural opening covering assembly 202 may be
implemented using the example architectural opening covering of FIG. 1. The
example architectural opening covering assemblies 200, 202 may be located in
the same room or building, positioned along a wall, and/or any other locations.
As described in greater detail below, the example first architectural opening
covering assembly 200 and the example second architectural opening covering
assembly 202 are different sizes but are otherwise substantially similar.
         [0039] In the illustrated example, the architectural opening covering
assemblies 200, 202 of FIG. 2 each include the following: a covering 204, 206
at least partially wound about a tube 208, 210; a motor 212, 214 operatively
coupled to the tube 208, 210; and a controller 216, 218 to control the motor
212, 214. In some examples, the architectural opening covering assemblies
200, 202 are implemented without the tubes 208, 210. For example, the
architectural opening covering assemblies 200, 202 may include coverings
employing, for example, strings and shutters and/or slats. Thus, in some such
examples, the coverings are raised and/or lowered via motors operatively
coupled to one or more rotary components such as a shaft, a wheel, a lead
screw and/or one or more additional and/or alternative rotary components that
move (e.g., retract and/or release) one or more of the strings. In the illustrated
example, the example coverings 204, 206 each include an end rail 220, 222 to
provide stability to the example coverings 204, 208. The example
architectural opening covering assemblies 200, 202 are each supported by a
frame 226, 228 having a sill extending from the frame 226, 228 into a path of
the end rail 222, 224. For example, if the coverings 204, 206 are lowered a
given distance, the end rails 220, 224 of the coverings 204, 206 contact the
sills 230, 232, respectively.
                                       - 16 -

         [0040] In the illustrated example, the sills 230, 232 are at substantially
similar heights relative to, for example, a floor. However, the example
architectural opening covering assemblies 200, 202 of FIG. 2 are different
sizes. For example, in the illustrated example, a first radius 234 of the tube
208 of the first architectural opening covering assembly 200 is less than a
second radius 236 of the tube 210 of the example second architectural opening
covering assembly 202. In some examples, an amount of the covering 204
wound around the tube 208 (e.g., a number of layers formed by the covering
204 wound around the tube 208) and/or a thickness of the covering 204 (e.g., a
sheet thickness) is different than an amount of the covering 206 wound around
the tube 210 and/or a thickness of the covering 206. Also, the example frames
226, 228 support the example architectural opening covering assemblies 200,
202 at different heights (e.g., axes of rotation of the first tube 208 and the
second tube 210 are at different distances from the respective sills 230, 232).
In other examples, the frames 226, 228 and/or the architectural opening
covering assemblies 200, 202 are substantially the same size, supported at
substantially the same height and/or the coverings 204, 206 have substantially
the same thickness.
         [0041] The example architectural opening covering assemblies 200,
202 include a local input device 238, 240. In the illustrated example, the local
input devices 238, 240 are substantially similar to the example input device
138 of FIG. 1. Thus, the example local input devices 238, 240 may be input
devices operatively coupled to the tubes 208, 210 and/or the motors 212, 214
(e.g., a cord, crank, actuator, etc.) and/or input devices communicatively
coupled to the controllers 216, 218 and/or the motors 212, 214 (e.g., a switch,
a remote control, etc.), respectively, that enable a user to operate the respective
architectural opening covering assemblies 200, 202 (e.g., a user may raise
and/or lower the covering 304 via the local input device 238, and the user may
raise or lower the covering 206 via the local input device 240).
         [0042] The example controllers 216, 218 of FIG. 2 are substantially
similar to and/or may be implemented using the example controller 122 of
FIG. 1. Thus, the example controllers 216, 218 of FIG. 2 monitor angular
                                        - 17 -

positions of the tubes 208, 210 via tube angular position sensors 242, 244
(e.g., gravitational sensors and/or any other type of angular position sensors),
determine positions of the coverings 204, 206, determine rotational speeds of
the tubes 208, 210, etc. In the illustrated example, the example controllers
216, 218 are communicatively coupled to a central input device 246 such as,
for example an input device similar to or identical to the example input device
138 of FIG. 1. In some examples, the central input device 246 is located
remotely relative to the architectural opening covering assemblies 200, 202 of
FIG. 2. For example, the central input device 246 may be located in a
different room than one or both of the architectural opening covering
assemblies 200, 202.
         [0043] In the illustrated example, the controllers 216, 218 receive a
first command from the central input device 246 to enter a speed setting mode.
In some examples, the first command is transmitted in response to a user
action (e.g., pressing a button). In the illustrated example, the speeds at which
the coverings 204, 206 are to move during operation are independently
established while each of the controllers 216, 218 are in the speed setting
mode. In some examples, a user may coordinate the speeds at which the
coverings 204, 206 are to move during operation based on visual appearances
of the respective architectural opening covering assemblies 200, 202 such as,
for example, distances of the end rails 222, 224 from the sills 230, 232, a
distance between the end rail 222 and the end rail 224, and/or other positions
of the coverings 204, 206. For example, the coverings 204, 206 may be
horizontally aligned to establish substantially the same speed at which the
coverings 204, 206 are to move during operation or the coverings 206, 206
may be spaced apart vertically to establish different speeds at which the
coverings 204, 206 are to move during operation.
         [0044] In the illustrated example, the reference positions of the
coverings 204, 206 are lower limit positions. In other examples, the reference
positions are other positions (e.g., upper limit positions, fully unwound
positions, and/or any other positions). In the illustrated example, the lower
limit positions and thus, the reference positions of the coverings 204, 206 are
                                       - 18  -

positions of the coverings 204, 206 at which the end rails 222, 224 contact the
sills 230, 232, respectively. Further, while the example coverings 204, 206 of
FIG. 2 have substantially the same reference position, in other examples the
coverings 204, 206 have different reference positions from each other. For
example, the reference position utilized by the example controller 216 may be
the lower limit position of the covering 204, and the reference position utilized
by the controller 218 may be the upper limit position of the covering 206. In
some examples, the reference positions are established during the speed
setting mode. In other examples, the reference positions are previously
established during a programming mode such as one or more of the
programming modes described in U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.
61/648,011, International Application No. PCT/US2012/000428, and/or U.S.
International Application No. PCT/US2012/000429.
         [0045] While the example controllers 216, 218 are in the speed setting
mode, the coverings 204, 206 may be moved to speed setting positions that are
desired distances away from the reference positions. For example, the user
may operate the local input devices 238, 240 to move the coverings 204, 206
relative to the reference positions. In some examples, the controllers 216, 218
monitor movement and/or angular positions of the tubes 208, 210, respectively
(e.g., relative to the reference position and/or other position(s)), in a manner
similar or identical to the example controller 122 of FIG. 1 disclosed above
and/or in a manner described in U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.
61/648,011, International Application No. PCT/US2012/000428, and/or U.S.
International Application No. PCT/US2012/000429. In the illustrated
example, the controllers 216, 218 determine the speed setting positions based
on the angular positions of the tubes 208, 210 when the central input device
246 communicates a second command. The coverings 204, 206 illustrated in
FIG. 2 are in speed setting positions a first distance D1 away from the sills
230, 232, respectively. Thus, in the illustrated example, the speed setting
positions of the coverings 204, 206 are substantially the same distance away
from the respective reference positions of the coverings 204, 206.
                                        - 19 -

         [0046] Once the example controllers 216, 218 receive the second
command from the example central input device 246 (e.g., in response to a
user action), the controllers 216, 218 establish the speeds at which the example
coverings 204, 206 are to be moved via the motors 212, 214 during operation.
In the illustrated example, the controllers 216, 218 establish the speeds based
on the speed setting positions of the coverings 204, 206. In the illustrated
example, the controller 216 of the first architectural opening covering
assembly 200 determines that the covering 204 is to move at a speed
substantially equivalent to moving the first distance D1 in a predetermined
amount of time (e.g., 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, etc.). Likewise, the
controller 218 of the second architectural opening covering assembly 202
determines that the covering 206 is to move at a speed substantially equivalent
to the first distance D1 in the predetermined amount of time. For example, if
the predetermined amount of time is ten seconds and the first distance D1 is
one foot, the controllers 216, 218 determine that the coverings 204, 206 are to
be moved via the motors 212, 214 (e.g., be raised or lowered by the motor
212, 214) at a speed of approximately one foot per ten seconds.
         [0047] Although the same predetermined amount of time is used by
the controller 216 of the first architectural opening covering assembly 200 and
the controller 218 of the second architectural opening covering assembly 202
of FIG. 2 in the illustrated example, in other examples the first controller 216
and the second controller 218 use different predetermined amounts of time to
determine the speeds at which the coverings 204, 206, respectively, are to
move during operation. In some examples, the predetermined amounts of time
are established during the example speed setting mode. In other examples, the
controller 216 and/or the controller 218 utilizes one or more previously stored
predetermined amounts of time.
         [0048] In some examples, the controllers 216, 218 determine the
speeds based on a number of revolutions of the tubes 208, 210 corresponding
to the first distance D1. For example, if the controller 216 of the first
architectural opening covering assembly 200 determines that the first distance
D1 corresponds to one revolution of the tube 208 (e.g., the tube 208 in the
                                        - 20 -

speed setting position is one revolution away from the reference position), the
controller 216 determines that a rotational speed at which the motor 212 is to
rotate the tube 208 is one revolution per ten seconds. If the example controller
218 of the second architectural opening covering assembly 202 determines
that the first distance D1 corresponds to 0.75 revolutions of the tube 210 (e.g.,
the tube 210 in the speed setting position is 0.75 revolutions away from the
reference position), the controller 218 determines that a rotational speed at
which the motor 214 is to rotate the tube 210 is 0.75 revolution per ten second.
In some examples, the controllers 216, 218 determine the speeds of the
coverings 204, 206 in other units of measurement (e.g., revolutions per
minute, etc.).
         [0049] Thus, by positioning the coverings 204, 206 of the example
architectural opening covering assemblies 200, 202 of FIG. 2 to desired
positions during the speed setting mode, the speeds at which the coverings
204, 204 are to move during operation of the example architectural opening
covering assemblies 200, 202 are configured. In the illustrated example of
FIG. 2, by aligning the example rails 222, 224 of the coverings 204, 206 to the
same height during the speed setting mode, the speeds at which the coverings
204, 206 will move during operation will substantially match. More
specifically, in the illustrated example, by moving the coverings 204, 206 to
the same speed setting positions during the speed setting mode, the motors
212, 214 rotate the differently sized tubes 208, 210 at different speeds to raise
and lower the coverings 204, 206 at substantially the same speed. As a result,
the coverings 204, 206 may move substantially in unison in response to a
command from the central input device 246 to move the coverings 204, 206 to
a given position (e.g., an upper limit position, a lower limit position, an
intermediate position, etc.). In this manner, the user may coordinate the
speeds at which coverings of a plurality of architectural opening covering
assemblies (e.g., located along a side of a building, in a room, etc.) raise and
lower based on the visual appearance (e.g., covering positions) of the
architectural opening covering assemblies.
                                       - 21 -

         [0050] FIG. 3 illustrates the example architectural opening covering
assemblies 200, 202 of FIG. 2 at different speed setting positions during the
speed setting mode. In the illustrated example, the covering 204 of the first
architectural opening covering assembly 200 is at a first speed setting position
that is the first distance D1 from the reference position (e.g., the lower limit
position). Thus, in response to a command from the central input device 246
to establish the speed at which the motor 212 is to move the covering 204
during operation, the controller 216 establishes the speed based on a number
of rotations of the tube 208 to move the covering 204 the first distance D1 in a
predetermined amount of time. In the illustrated example, if the
predetermined amount of time is ten seconds and the covering 204 moves the
first distance D1 in one revolution of the tube 208, the example controller 216
determines that the speed at which the tube 208 is to rotate during operation of
the example architectural opening covering assembly 200 is one revolution per
ten seconds (i.e., six revolutions per minute).
         [0051] The covering 206 of the example second architectural opening
covering assembly 202 is raised (e.g., via the local input device 240) to a
second speed setting position that is a second distance D2 away from the
reference position (e.g., the lower limit position). Thus, the example
controller 218 establishes the speed at which the motor 214 is to move the
covering 206 during operation based on a number of rotations of the tube 210
to move the covering 206 the second distance D2 (from the second speed
setting position to the reference position) in a predetermined amount of time.
In the illustrated example, if the predetermined amount of time is ten seconds
and the second distance D2 corresponds to 1.5 revolutions of the tube 210, the
example controller 216 determines that the speed at which the tube 210 is to
rotate via the motor 214 during operation of the example architectural opening
covering assembly 202 is 1.5 revolutions per ten seconds (i.e., nine revolutions
per minute).
         [0052] By moving the example coverings 204, 206 to different speed
setting positions during the speed setting mode in the illustrated example of
FIG. 3, the speeds at which the coverings 204, 206 move via the motors 212,
                                        - 22 -

214 are configured such that the speeds are different. More specifically,
because the reference position utilized by the example controllers 216, 218 are
substantially at the same height (e.g., relative to a floor) in the illustrated
example, a difference between the speeds at which the coverings 204, 206 are
determined to move is based on a distance between the speed setting positions
(D1, D2) of the coverings 204, 206. For example, if the second distance D2 is
twice the first distance D1, the covering 206 of the second example
architectural opening covering assembly 202 moves twice as fast as the
covering 204 of the first architectural opening covering assembly 200 during
operation.
         [0053] FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example controller 400
disclosed herein, which implements the example controller 122 of FIG. 1, the
example controller 216 of FIGS. 2-3 and/or the example controller 218 of
FIGS. 2-3. In the illustrated example, the controller 400 includes an
instruction processor 402, a motor controller 404, a tube rotational direction
determiner 406, a tube angular position determiner 408, a covering position
determiner 410, a tube rotational speed determiner 412 and a memory 414.
         [0054] The example instruction processor 400 of FIG. 4 receives
instructions or commands from a first input device 416 (e.g., the input device
138 of FIG. 1, the local input device 238 of FIG. 2, the local input device 240
of FIG. 2, etc.) and/or a second input device 418 (e.g., the central input device
246 and/or any other input device). In some examples, a polarity of a voltage
source (e.g., a power supply provided by the first input device 416 and/or the
second input device 418) is modulated (e.g., alternated) to communicate one
or more instructions. The instructions may include a command to, for
example lower a covering 420, raise the covering 420, enter the speed setting
mode, move the covering 420 at a given speed, and/or other instructions. In
some examples, the first input device 416 and/or the second input device 418
sends a signal (e.g., RF signals, network communications, etc.), which
corresponds to a client action (e.g., raise the covering 420, lower the covering,
enter the speed setting mode, move the covering 420 at a given speed, etc.).
The example instruction processor 402 determines which of a plurality of
                                       - 23  -

actions are instructed by the signal and/or communication transmitted from the
first input device 416 and/or the second input device 418. In some examples,
the first input device 416 and/or the second input device 418 instructs the
example instruction processor 402 to store a given position of a tube 422 (e.g.,
an angular position) as a reference position (e.g., a lower limit position, an
upper limit position, a position between the upper limit position and the lower
limit position, etc.) in the memory 414. Although the example controller 400
of FIG. 4 is used in conjunction with an architectural opening covering
assembly having the tube 422, the example controller 400 may be used in
conjunction with architectural opening covering assemblies that employ
additional and/or alternative rotary components to raise or lower a covering
such as, for example, a shaft, a wheel, a lead screw, and/or any other rotary
component.
         [0055] The example motor controller 404 of FIG. 4 controls a motor
424 (e.g., the example motor 120, the example motor 212, the example motor
214, etc.). For example, the example motor controller 404 of FIG. 4 sends a
signal to the motor 424 to cause the motor 424 to operate the covering 420
(e.g., rotate the tube 422 to raise or lower the covering 420, prevent (e.g.,
brake, stop, etc.) rotation of the tube 422, etc.). The example motor controller
404 also controls a speed at which the motor 424 rotates the tube 422 rotates
during operation of an example architectural opening covering assembly (e.g.,
the example architectural opening covering assembly 100, the example first
architectural opening covering assembly 200 of FIG. 2, the example second
architectural opening covering assembly 202 of FIG. 2, etc.). In some
examples, the motor controller 404 controls the speed of rotation of the tube
422 via a speed controller such as, for example, a pulse width modulation
speed controller, a brake, a voltage rectifier that supplies a voltage (e.g.,
power) to the motor 424 and/or any other component or device for operating
the motor 424 and/or the tube 422.
         [0056] The example tube rotational direction determiner 406 of FIG. 4
determines a direction of rotation (e.g., clockwise or counterclockwise) of the
tube 422. In some examples, the tube rotational direction determiner 406
                                        - 24 -

determines the direction of rotation of the tube 422 based on tube position
information communicated by a tube angular position sensor 426 (e.g., the
tube angular position sensor 122 of FIG. 1, the example tube angular position
sensor 242 of FIG. 2, the example tube angular position sensor 244 of FIG. 2,
etc.). In some examples, the tube angular position sensor 426 of FIG. 4 is a
gravitational sensor (e.g., an accelerometer, the gravitational sensor made by
Kionix® as part number KXTC9-2050, etc.). In other examples, the tube
angular position sensor 426 may include one or more other types of sensors
(e.g., a potentiometer, a Hall Effect type sensor, a resolver, rotary encoder
employing, for example, light, a magnet, and/or any other type of angular
position sensor). In some examples, the tube angular position sensor 426
outputs a plurality of values as the tube 422 rotates. In some examples, based
on how those values are changing (e.g., increasing or decreasing, changing
signs (e.g., positive to negative, negative to positive, etc.)), the tube rotational
direction determiner 406 determines the direction of rotation of the tube 422.
In some examples, the tube rotational direction determiner 406 associates the
direction of rotation of the tube 422 with raising or lowering the example
covering 420.
         [0057] The example tube angular position determiner 408 determines
an angular position of the tube 422 relative to a reference point, a reference
position and/or a frame of reference (e.g., a gravitational field vector of Earth,
an indicator (e.g., a marking, a light, a magnetic field, etc. on the tube 422
and/or other portion of the architectural opening covering assembly, a wall, an
architectural opening frame (e.g., the example first frame 226 of FIG. 2, the
example second frame 228 of FIG. 2, etc.), and/or any other structure). In
some examples, the tube angular position determiner 408 determines the
angular position of the tube 422 based on tube position information
communicated by the tube angular position sensor 426 and/or the rotational
direction of the tube 422 determined by the example tube rotational direction
determiner 406. In some examples, the tube angular position determiner 408
processes the tube position information (e.g., performs geometric calculations,
                                        - 25 -

converts a current signal to a voltage signal, etc.) to determine the angular
position of the tube 422.
         [0058] The example covering position determiner 410 of FIG. 4
determines a position of the covering 420 relative to a reference position (e.g.,
a previously stored position, a lower limit position, an upper limit position,
and/or any other reference position). In some examples, the covering position
determiner 410 determines the position of the covering 420 based on an
angular displacement (e.g., an amount of rotation) of the tube 422 from the
reference position. In some examples, the covering position determiner 410
determines that a given position of the covering 420 is the reference position
based on a command from the first input device 416 and/or the second input
device 418. For example, the first input device 416 and/or the second input
device 418 communicates an instruction to the controller 400 to establish a
reference position at a position of the covering 420 at a time when the
instruction is received. In some examples, in response to the instruction, the
covering position determiner 410 establishes the reference position and
substantially continuously monitors subsequent positions of the covering 420
relative to the reference position. In some examples, the covering position
determiner 410 determines the position of the covering 420 in units of degrees
of rotation (e.g., 30 degrees, 720 degrees, etc.) of the tube 422 relative to the
reference position, a number of rotations (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 3.4, etc.) of the tube 422
from the reference position and/or any other unit of measurement.
         [0059] The example tube rotational speed determiner 412 of FIG. 4
determines a speed at which the example covering 420 is to move during
operation of the example architectural opening covering assembly. In some
examples, the example tube rotational speed determiner 412 determines the
speed at which the example covering 420 is to move by determining a speed at
which the motor controller 404 is to cause the motor 424 to rotate the tube
422. In the illustrated example, the tube rotational speed determiner 412
determines the speed of rotation of the tube 422 based on a value (e.g., a
number of rotations, a distance measurement, and/or any other value.)
corresponding to a position of the covering 420.
                                       - 26 -

        [0060] In some examples, the tube rotational speed determiner 412
determines the speed of rotation of the tube 422 based on the position (e.g., a
speed setting position) of the covering 420 relative to a reference position. In
some examples, the first input device 416 and/or the second input device 418
communicates a command to the instruction processor 402 to establish (e.g.,
determine, set, adjust and/or change) the speed of rotation of the tube 422
based on the position of the covering 420 relative to the reference position at a
given time. Based on the distance between the position of the covering 420
and the reference position (e.g., a number of rotations of the tube 422 away
from the reference position) at the given time (e.g., when the command is
received), the tube rotational speed determiner 412 determines (e.g.,
calculates) the speed at which the covering 420 is to move during operation of
the example architectural opening covering assembly.
        [0061] In some examples, the tube rotational speed determiner 412
determines the speed of rotation of the tube 422 based on a predetermined
amount of time in which the covering 420 is to move from the speed setting
position (e.g., a position of the tube 422 at a time when the command is
received to the reference position). For example, if the predetermined amount
of time is fifteen seconds and the covering 420 is two rotations of the tube 422
from the reference position when the example controller 400 receives a
command to establish the speed, the tube rotational speed determiner 412
determines that the tube 422 is to rotate two rotations per fifteen seconds (i.e.,
eight revolutions per minute). In this case, during subsequent operation of the
example architectural opening covering assembly (e.g., raising the covering
420, lowering the covering 420, etc.), the example motor controller 404
controls the motor 424 to rotate the tube 422 at two rotations per fifteen
seconds. Other examples use other predetermined amounts of time (e.g., 10
seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, etc.) to determine the speed of rotation of the
tube 422 based on the speed setting position of the tube 422. In some
examples, the tube rotational speed determiner 412 uses a predetermined
amount of time stored in the memory 414.
                                        - 27 -

        [0062] The example memory 414 of FIG. 4 organizes and/or stores
information such as, for example, tube position information generated by the
example tube angular position sensor 426, a position of the covering 420, a
direction or rotation of the tube 422 to raise the covering 420, a direction of
rotation of the tube 422 to lower the covering 420, one or more reference
positions of the covering 420 (e.g., a fully unwound position, an upper limit
position, a lower limit position, etc.), a speed at which the tube 422 is to rotate
during operation of the example architectural opening covering assembly, one
or more predetermined amounts of time, one or more instructions or
commands corresponding to signals (e.g., a number of polarity changes) to be
communicated by of the first input device 416 and/or the second input device
418, and/or any other information that may be utilized during the operation of
the example architectural opening covering assembly.
        [0063] While an example manner of implementing the example
controller 122 of FIG. 1, the example controller 216 of FIGS. 2-3 and/or the
example controller 218 of FIGS. 2-3 is illustrated in FIG. 4, one or more of the
elements, processes and/or devices illustrated in FIG. 4 may be combined,
divided, re-arranged, omitted, eliminated and/or implemented in any other
way. Further, the example instruction processor 402, the example motor
controller 404, the example tube rotational direction determiner 406, the
example tube angular position determiner 408, the example covering position
determiner 410, the example tube rotational speed determiner 412, the
example memory 414, the example first input device 416, the example second
input device 418, the example tube angular position sensor 426 and/or, more
generally, the example controller 400 of FIG. 4 may be implemented by
hardware, software, firmware and/or any combination of hardware, software
and/or firmware. Thus, for example, any of the example instruction processor
402, the example motor controller 404, the example tube rotational direction
determiner 406, the example tube angular position determiner 408, the
example covering position determiner 410, the example tube rotational speed
determiner 412, the example memory 414, the example first input device 416,
the example second input device 418, the example tube angular position
                                        - 28 -

sensor 426 and/or, more generally, the example controller 400 of FIG. 4 could
be implemented by one or more analog or digital circuit(s), logic circuits,
programmable processor(s), application specific integrated circuit(s)
(ASIC(s)), programmable logic device(s) (PLD(s)) and/or field programmable
logic device(s) (FPLD(s)). When reading any of the apparatus or system
claims of this patent to cover a purely software and/or firmware
implementation, at least one of the example, instruction processor 402, the
example motor controller 404, the example tube rotational direction
determiner 406, the example tube angular position determiner 408, the
example covering position determiner 410, the example tube rotational speed
determiner 412, the example memory 414, the example first input device 416,
the example second input device 418, the example tube angular position
sensor 426 and/or, more generally, the example controller 400 of FIG. 4 are
hereby expressly defined to include a tangible computer readable storage
device or storage disk such as a memory, a digital versatile disk (DVD), a
compact disk (CD), a Blu-ray disk, etc. storing the software and/or firmware.
Further still, the example controller 400 of FIG. 4 may include one or more
elements, processes and/or devices in addition to, or instead of, those
illustrated in FIG. 4, and/or may include more than one of any or all of the
illustrated elements, processes and devices.
         [0064] A flowchart representative of example machine readable
instructions for implementing the example controller 400 of FIG. 4 is shown
in FIG. 5. In this example, the machine readable instructions comprise a
program for execution by a processor such as the processor 612 shown in the
example processor platform 600 discussed below in connection with FIG. 6.
The program may be embodied in software stored on a tangible computer
readable storage medium such as a CD-ROM, a floppy disk, a hard drive, a
digital versatile disk (DVD), a Blu-ray disk, or a memory associated with the
processor 612, but the entire program and/or parts thereof could alternatively
be executed by a device other than the processor 612 and/or embodied in
firmware or dedicated hardware. Further, although the example program is
described with reference to the flowchart illustrated in FIG. 4, many other
                                       - 29 -

methods of implementing the example controller 400 may alternatively be
used. For example, the order of execution of the blocks may be changed,
and/or some of the blocks described may be changed, eliminated, or
combined.
         [0065] As mentioned above, the example process of FIG. 5 may be
implemented using coded instructions (e.g., computer and/or machine readable
instructions) stored on a tangible computer readable storage medium such as a
hard disk drive, a flash memory, a read-only memory (ROM), a compact disk
(CD), a digital versatile disk (DVD), a cache, a random-access memory
(RAM) and/or any other storage device or storage disk in which information is
stored for any duration (e.g., for extended time periods, permanently, for brief
instances, for temporarily buffering, and/or for caching of the information).
As used herein, the term tangible computer readable storage medium is
expressly defined to include any type of computer readable storage device
and/or storage disk and to exclude propagating signals. As used herein,
"tangible computer readable storage medium" and "tangible machine readable
storage medium" are used interchangeably. Additionally or alternatively, the
example process of FIG. 5 may be implemented using coded instructions (e.g.,
computer and/or machine readable instructions) stored on a non-transitory
computer and/or machine readable medium such as a hard disk drive, a flash
memory, a read-only memory, a compact disk, a digital versatile disk, a cache,
a random-access memory and/or any other storage device or storage disk in
which information is stored for any duration (e.g., for extended time periods,
permanently, for brief instances, for temporarily buffering, and/or for caching
of the information). As used herein, the term non-transitory computer
readable medium is expressly defined to include any type of computer
readable device or disk and to exclude propagating signals. As used herein,
when the phrase "at least" is used as the transition term in a preamble of a
claim, it is open-ended in the same manner as the term "comprising" is open
ended.
         [0066] The example program 500 of FIG. 5 begins at block 502 when
the covering position determiner 410 monitors a position of the covering 420
                                       - 30 -

of an architectural opening covering assembly (e.g., the example architectural
opening covering assembly of FIG. 1, the example first architectural opening
covering 200 assembly of FIG. 2, the example second architectural opening
covering assembly 202 of FIG. 2, etc.). In some examples, the controller 400
receives a signal from the first input device 416 and/or the second input device
418 communicating a command to enter a speed setting mode. The example
instruction processor 402 of FIG. 4 processes the signal, and the example
controller 400 enters the speed setting mode and monitors the position of the
covering 420 relative to a reference position such as, for example, a lower
limit position, an upper limit position, etc. In some examples, while the
controller 400 is in the speed setting mode, the covering 420 is moved via the
first input device 416 and/or the second input device 418 (e.g., a user actuates
a cord, actuates a switch, etc.), and the example covering position determiner
310 monitors the movement of the covering 410 based on tube position
information generated via the tube angular position sensor 426. In some
examples, the tube angular position sensor 426 generates position information
on additional and/or alternative rotary components of the architectural opening
covering, and the covering position determiner 310 monitors the movement of
the covering 420 based on that position information. In some examples, the
controller 400 determines, sets and/or stores the reference position in response
to the command to enter the speed setting mode. In other examples, the
reference position is previously established in a programming or calibration
mode.
         [0067] At block 504, the covering position determiner 410 determines
a speed setting position of the covering 420 in response to a first command
from the first input device 416 and/or the second input device 418 (e.g., the
input device 138 of FIG. 1, the central input device 346 of FIG. 2, etc.). In
some examples, the speed setting position is a position of the covering 420
relative to the reference position at a time when the example controller 400
receives the first command.
         [0068] At block 506, based on the speed setting position of the
covering 420, the tube rotational speed determiner 412 determines a speed at
                                        -31 -

which to move the covering 420. In some examples, the tube rotational speed
determiner 412 determines the speed to move the covering 420 based on a
distance from the speed setting position to the reference position and a
predetermined amount of time (e.g., 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 30
seconds, etc.). In some examples, the tube rotational speed determiner 412
uses a predetermined amount of time that is stored in the example memory
414. For example, if the distance between the speed setting position and the
reference position is one foot and the predetermined amount of time is 15
seconds, the tube rotational speed determiner 412 determines that the speed to
move the covering 420 is one foot per fifteen seconds (i.e., 4 feet per minute).
         [0069] In some examples, the tube rotational speed determiner 412
determines the distance between the speed setting position and the reference
position by determining a number of rotations of the tube 422 and/or a number
of rotations of one or more additional and/or alternative rotary components to
move the covering 420 from the speed setting position to the reference
position. For example, if the reference position is one rotation of the tube 422
in a first direction from a fully unwound position of the covering 420, and the
covering position determiner 412 determines that the speed setting position is
five rotations of the tube 422 in the first direction from the fully unwound
position, the distance between the speed setting position and the reference
position is four rotations of the example tube 422. In some examples, the tube
rotational speed determiner 412 determines the speed at which to move the
covering 420 by dividing the number of rotations by the predetermined
amount of time. For example, if the tube rotational speed determiner 412
determines that the distance corresponds to four rotations and the
predetermined amount of time is 15 seconds, the tube rotational speed
determiner 412 determines the speed to move the covering 420 is four
rotations of the tube 422 per fifteen seconds (i.e., 16 rotations of the tube per
minute). In some examples, the tube rotational speed determiner 412 stores
the speed in the memory 414.
         [0070] At block 508, in response to a second command from the first
input device 416 and/or the second input device 418 to move the covering 420
                                       - 32  -

(e.g., raise or lower the covering 420), the example motor controller 404 of
FIG. 4 sends a signal to the motor 424 to move the covering at the determined
speed. For example, the motor controller 404 sends a signal to the motor 424
to rotate the tube 422 at a speed of four rotations per fifteen seconds. In some
examples, in response to the second command and/or another command, the
example controller 400 exits the speed setting mode.
         [0071] FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an example processor platform
600 capable of executing the instructions of FIG. 5 to implement the example
controller 400 of FIG. 4. The processor platform 600 can be, for example, a
server, a personal computer, a mobile device (e.g., a cell phone, a smart phone,
a tablet such as an iPadTM), a personal digital assistant (PDA), an Internet
appliance, or any other type of computing device.
         [0072] The processor platform 600 of the illustrated example includes
a processor 612. The processor 612 of the illustrated example is hardware.
For example, the processor 612 can be implemented by one or more integrated
circuits, logic circuits, microprocessors or controllers from any desired family
or manufacturer.
         [0073] The processor 612 of the illustrated example includes a local
memory 613 (e.g., a cache). The processor 612 of the illustrated example is in
communication with a main memory including a volatile memory 614 and a
non-volatile memory 616 via a bus 618. The volatile memory 614 may be
implemented by Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM),
Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), RAMBUS Dynamic Random
Access Memory (RDRAM) and/or any other type of random access memory
device. The non-volatile memory 616 may be implemented by flash memory
and/or any other desired type of memory device. Access to the main memory
614, 616 is controlled by a memory controller.
         [0074] The processor platform 600 of the illustrated example also
includes an interface circuit 620. The interface circuit 620 may be
implemented by any type of interface standard, such as an Ethernet interface, a

          [0080] From the foregoing, it will appreciate that the above disclosed
methods, apparatus, systems and articles of manufacture enable a speed of a
covering of an architectural opening covering assembly to be determined, set
                                        - 34 -

and/or stored based on a position of the covering. In this manner, speeds at
which coverings of a plurality of architectural opening covering assemblies,
which may include tubes having different sizes, move during operation may be
easily coordinated (e.g., synchronized) by adjusting the positions of the
coverings relative to reference positions and/or each other. Thus, the speeds
may be set based on a visual appearance of one or more architectural opening
covering assemblies (e.g., without a user having knowledge and/or concern for
characteristics of the architectural opening covering assemblies such as a size
of a tube.
         [0081] Although certain example methods, apparatus and articles of
manufacture have been disclosed herein, the scope of coverage of this patent is
not limited thereto. On the contrary, this patent covers all methods, apparatus
and articles of manufacture fairly falling within the scope of the claims of this
patent.
         [0082] Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification
should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely
