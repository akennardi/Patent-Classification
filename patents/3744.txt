The present invention is a system and methodology designed to integrate estate planners,
manager and/or legal service provider processes with individual end user browser activity in
a secure and encrypted online environment (including but not limited to private Blockchain
Ledgers) to ensure that all online accounts and digital assets are readily accessible for the
purpose of testamentary disbursement. This facilitates quicker and cost effective probate for
executors maximising the assets available to the beneficiaries.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 [0001]         The present invention is a methodology to solve the problem of accessing and
disbursing "Digital Assets" (those assets that are contained in social media platforms and
Cloud storage or are only accessible through internet based interfaces) in circumstances
where such assets are highly transitory over time and the access to these accounts in terms of
log-ins and password or verification protocols will likewise alter regularly, but the legal
devices used to identify and instruct asset distribution in the case of death or permanent
disability are by law immutable and primarily analogue (paper based). More particularly, the
invention is a system and methodology that will capture the changes of Digital Assets as an
automated process, store that information in a secured and immutable dispersed ledger
protocol and then amalgamate and distribute the information at the time of need through a
verified dual encrypted process.
BACKGROUND
 [0002]         In 2010, the inadequacy of Digital Asset management and associated platform
disposition processes was defined and discussed in a Texas Tech School of Law Legal
 Studies Research Paper. Three years later the Australian Communications Consumer Action
Network ("ACCAN") and the University of Melbourne further explored the problem and
jointly published Death and the Internet: Consumer issuesfor planning and managing digital
legacies:
      "The growing use of software applicationsin the home, the workplace, and in public
    places has resulted in the increased production and use of personal digital files.
     These digitalfiles may take the form of emails sent to colleagues,photos offamily and

    friends        taken on a camera or smartphone, music downloaded from a number of
     different services, or videos taken at weddings or birthdayparties.In this environment
     of increased data production and usage, unavoidable questions arise as to what
     happens to thesefiles when a person dies.2 "
[0003]              Since that report, additional virtual disruptions such as crypto-currency and large
scale security breaches, have made this issue both more pressing and more problematic.
While questions of ownership regarding online accounts and digital media files are still being
adjudicated and regulated, at a more basic level access to these accounts in the event of death
or incapacity remains an unsolved logistical and security problem with associated legal risks
for Estate planning services.
[0004]              While the Common Law countries share very similar approaches to documenting
and validating a Last Will and Testament, and will recognise the validity of one another's
testamentary processes, procedures regarding obtaining access to an online account post
mortem are inconsistent across services and jurisdictions. Proving ownership and accessing
accounts in circumstances where the Executor does not have the login and password can be
time consuming, confusing as to jurisdictions and international protocol, and expensive.
Navigating this terrain can severely diminish the value of the Estate and creates a risk that
large assets of the Estate are never even identified. This matter has recently risen to the level
of regulatory notice and is now an active review of the NSW Justice Law Reform
Commission.3
[0005]              Large law firms with global markets are only now starting to include virtual asset
management in their estate planning services despite recommendations that doing so have

                                                                                                  3
been made in multiple whitepapers and best practice reports. While the ACCAN report
stated "Many legal professionals and estate planners suggest the inclusion of a 'digital
registrar' in a will that states the location and passwords of digital accounts with additional
instructions such as 'delete all files' or 'create an online memorial', 4 most firms avoid
retaining any of their clients' login or password information for reasons of security and risk
mitigation. A common solution is to provide the client with a paper or card form for them to
complete and keep in a secure place such as a safe. But the fluidity of the digital space often
renders these lists, if they can even be located, obsolete or incomplete by the time of death or
incapacity. Small and medium firms and non-legal estate planning systems, many still using
analogue file processes, may not even consider or mention digital assets.
[0006]         It is apparent that a need exists for a method that assists service providers in the
capture of digital assets at the time of document drafting, facilitates the ongoing updating of
access for those assets in a manner that is secure and convenient for the client, stores that
information in an inviolable form and disburses that information only to the proper person
and only at the proper time. The present invention is directed toward providing such a
technique.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0007]         It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and a system for the
proper and safe collection, management, storage and dissemination of digital property and
virtual account access information through the use of encrypted and secured platforms,
including but not limited to private Blockchain ledgers. A specific object of the invention is
the customisation of existing processes to facilitate the creation of bespoke, encrypted and
disbursed platforms that will solve the security and storage capacity issues presented by
server located centralised digital asset registries. Another specific object of this invention is

                                                                                                 4
increasing the privacy and the security protection of digital asset access.
[0008]         It is an additional object of the present invention to generate convenient and easy
to use interactive interfaces through browser plug-ins that will capture digital property access
information in real time and securely update the associated end user ledgers.           A specific
object of this invention is to provide a means of capturing and retaining vital asset access
information that is by its nature fluid, and integrate that information into a legal process that
is by regulation and design inflexible, specifically the process of creating and retaining
legally valid testamentary documents and ensuring they are appropriately disbursed in
accordance with relevant probate laws. These and other objects of the invention will be
apparent to those skilled in the art from the descriptions that follow.
[0009]         The method and the system of this invention centres around the innovative
concept of integrating existing service providers' precedents and processes with a public and
private encrypted platform ("Platform') - which may be (but is not limited to) a private
Blockchain Ledger - with their customers' ("End users -EU') online asset and digital media
accounts ("Digital Assets").          This will be accomplished through a secure and encrypted
browser interface. This ensures that access to all digital assets and online accounts are current
and securely available to an EU's verified executors, no matter the number of changes that
may have occurred as between the drafting and validation of their Last Will & Testament and
the time of their death or permanent incapacity.
[0010]         The method and the system of this invention will be customisable to integrate
with a variety of third party processes and software applications for data sharing and
verification purposes. It may include consultation services, digital conversion services,
training, implementation, data capture, browser interfaces and information management
applications as well as using best practice encryption protocols to capture, manage, encrypt,
validate and disburse digital asset information through a private and secured platform which

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0025]         Terminology used in this application is for the purpose of describing particular
embodiments only and is not intended to be used as a limitation of the invention. Singular
forms are intended to also include the plural unless it is otherwise contextually clear that they
do not. Additionally, it is understood that terms like "comprised" or "including" that are used
to specify the presence of features, steps, operations, elements and/or components do not
preclude the presence or possibility of the addition of one or more other features, steps,
operations, elements and/or components.                  All terms are intended to be interpreted in
accordance to common dictionary meanings and as used within the context of the relevant
arts of Law and Computer Science.
[0026]         It is understood that this invention is a method comprised of a number of
techniques and steps. Each has an individual benefit as well as contributing to the whole of
the method and could additionally be applied, in whole or in part, in conjunction with other
existing or anticipated techniques and protocols. The specification and claims should be read
with the understanding such combinations and applications are entirely within the scope of
the invention and claims.
 [0027]        For security reasons necessitated by the use of a public/private dual key encrypted
platform, the method and system of this invention is intended to be delivered as a business to
business service model. Commercial delivery through legal service providers and financial
institutions, charitable delivery through NGO's, regulatory delivery through Government
agencies and DIY delivery through justice access and self directed web services (existing or
not yet established) are all possible service providers and are specifically, but not exclusively,
encompassed in the method and the system of this invention.

                                                                                                   9
 [0028]         No matter how the end user accesses this process, their transactional ledger will
be stored, secured and verified on a private platform associated with their service provider.
Consequently all access to the process needs to be managed through an online service
intermediary. It is not necessary, for the purpose of this invention, to specify which platform
will be used so long as the platform supports complex functions, facilitates a dual key
encrypted process and allows for a secured private network. Current technology indicators
are that the best currently available process would be the establishment of a private
Blockchain and that is the system envisioned in the drawing, but the invention is by no means
limited in that regard.
 [0029]         The role of the Platform in this invention is multifaceted, acting as a liaison
between the Service Provider, the End User and various regulatory bodies of the relevant
jurisdiction.
 [0030]         Referring to Figure 1, the Platform will verify the legitimacy of the Service
Provider and provide the Service Provider with an ongoing subscription based service
through which they can ensure that their clients' (end users') asset information is retained in
real time so that, at the time of need, the information is current and readily accessible by the
authorised parties.
 [0031]         Referring to Figures 2 through 4, the Platform will assist the SP in establishing an
easy to use online protocol to capture their clients' data and integrate it with their existing
precedents and protocols for the generation of Testamentary documents.           The platform will
create an End User specific ledger on the Service Provider's account.
  [0032]        Referring now to Figure 5, the Platform will provide secure browser interfaces
(these program applications are intended to be the subject of further Patents) for End Users
that can capture account access changes in real time and verify those changes with the EU.

                                                                                                 10
[0033]         The Platform will host, or integrate with other private hosts, the data in a form
that is encrypted, immutable and disbursed for security reasons. It will also provide periodic
reports to the SP's as to the account activities of their clients, but will do so without divulging
any account specific private data.
[0034]         Referring to Figures 1, 8 and 11, the Platform will integrate with or have access to
external official data, such as Government registries, as well as have other protocols in place,
to verify the credentials of the Service Provider as well as the legitimacy of Trigger Events
prior to disseminating the EU ledger and the confirmation of Probate prior to EU ledger
deletion.
[0035]         Referring now to Figure 9, once verified the Platform will amalgamate and
disseminate Digital Asset information only to the certified Service Provider through a dual
encrypted process, and in a form that can be included in the Testamentary document that is
legally binding and recognised by the relevantjurisdiction (refer to Figure 10).
[0036]         Finally, referencing Figure 11, after dissemination, the Platform will lock down
the EU ledger and await final verification of the end of probate. Once verified, the Platform
will enact a series of validation protocols that will ultimately result in the pennanent deletion
of the EU ledger.
