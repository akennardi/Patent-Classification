   Related Applications
 5 The present application is a divisional of parent Australian
   patent application no.             2013345495, which is a national phase
   application        of   PCT/PT2013/000066,           the   contents     of which          are
   incorporated herein by reference.
10 Field of the Invention
   The     scanning     of bulky     documents        such   as passports         currently
   requires        the    intervention       of    the    user,      due   to     the       fact
   existing        scanners     are    only    capable       of   correctly         scanning
15 flat documents.
   In    relation       to   border     control,       specifically        at     airports,
   many scanners fail to scan documents                     accurately, largely due
   to the need for human             intervention. The main problem is the
20 correct positioning- of the document, passports                          for example,
   where       there   is   a  need    to   push     the   same     into   position          and
   hold it down in order to guarantee an accurate reading.
   Several different alternative                solutions have been tried out,
25 namely the        use   of visual      animation.       However,      these      attempts
   merely       reduced    the  margin     of   error     and   failed     to    deal      with
   the problem involving the need for the user to intervene.
   Hence,        a   solution      was     required        for     obtaining          greater
30 efficiency when scanning bulky documents.

                                                        2
   This   invention         was    conceived           with this          in   mind,       and ensures
   the automatic scanning of all types of document with no need
   for active human involvement.
 5 State of the art
   Nowadays        the     use       of     scanners          with       sliding          drawers     for
   scanning flat documents is common.
   Some   of     the    patents         illustrating            the      state        of   the    art  in
10 this     area        of      technical              invention            include          US5790278,
   DE29716637U and US6157466.
   In   the     case     of    patent        N*      US    5790278,         the     document       to  be
   scanned is placed on a tray which is later removed, the scan
15 taking place         while      the      document         is   being       collected.         However
   this mechanism only serves to scan flat documents.
   Patent      N*     DE29716637U              refers        to     a    scanner          featuring      a
   mechanism which transfers the documents to the scan area. In
20 this   case      the    principal           innovation          is    the     fact      the   optical
   scanner features a mechanism for transferring the documents,
   but once again, only flat documents can be scanned.
   Patent      US    6157466         corresponds            to   a     computer          scanner,     and
25 includes       a   mechanism          composed          of   a     drawer       for     withdrawing
   the document and subsequent scanning.
   There    is    not     one     scanner          in    the    current         state       of  the   art
   with   a    automatic         feeder         composed        of     a   single        platform     for
30 scanning      bulky      documents.            Existing        scanners         are     composed    of
   drawers      or   trays       for     storing          and transferring               documents     to
   the scanning area.

                                                         3
   Furthermore,         existing mechanisms                      involve         the document            being
   moved to the          scanning          area,        whereas          with this          invention          it
   is   the     platform         itself        which        moves        and      not     the     document,
   thereby        significantly             reducing            the       risk       of    damaging          the
 5 document.

   detected        by   the       document          detection             sensor        the      controller
   activates the linear actuator which together with the linear
   spring holds the document                      in     place on the platform,                      and the
20 motor     is    activated         to move         the platform to an                     end position
   where     the     document         is    scanned           by     a    scanner,         and when          the
   document        has   been        scanned         the       linear         actuator         and     linear
   spring       release       the       document          and      the      platform         is     returned
   back to the initial position.
25 Another         aspect         provides           an        automatic             document          feeder
   comprising:         a    transparent               sliding          platform;           side      guides,
   longitudinal guides and a horizontal guide;                                       a spring system;
   a  controller;         a    linear       actuator;             a    protection          bar;      a   rigid
   part;      a    set   of      bushings;            bearings;            a    document          detection
30 sensor,        motion      sensor        and        end      position           sensor;        a    linear
   spring;        a   bobbin;           and      a      motor,          wherein          the      automatic

                                                           4
   document          feeder          is    adapted          to     receive          a    bulky        document
   preferably a passport.
   A    further          aspect        provides           a    method         using         the      automatic
   document         feeder,         wherein        the     method        comprises           the     following
 5 steps:        a   user        places      the      document           on   a    platform          with       the
   side to be read facing the platform;                                   a motion sensor detects
   the      document           and     sends       a     signal         to    the       controller,             the
   document         is    repositioned              on    the     platform          by     the     horizontal
   guide       using        the      spring       system         of     springs;          the      controller
10 sends        an     electronic           signal          to     the       linear         actuator;           the
   linear         actuator          is    activated           on     receiving            the      electronic
   signal,          the       linear        actuator           pins        the       document           to      the
   transparent            platform         with       the     help       of   longitudinal              guides;
   the     linear        actuator         sends        a    signal        to    activate          the     motor,
15 whereby the movement is transferred to the platform by means
   of    the      bobbin        which     places         the     platform          in     a   position          for
   the     document          to    be    read;       an    end position-sensor                     determines
   the     document          is    in   the     reading         position,           whereby         the     motor
   starts          pre-programmed                 rotations            to      begin          reading           the
20 document;           the      document       is     read      by    a    document          reader;        after
   reading,         the      document        reader         sends       an    electronic            signal        to
   the     controller,              which,      on      receiving           the     signal         determines
   the     reading        process         has     been       concluded;           and      the     controller
   sends       a   signal        to    the    linear         actuator         and      to     the     motor       in
25 order       for the platform to                   return       the      document          to   an    initial
   position for collection by the user.
   Another aspect provides an automatic document                                            feeder capable
   of      handling             passports,            the       automatic             document            feeder
   comprising:               a      frame;         a      transparent               sliding           platform

25
   The     present         invention           relates         to     both       the    device     and  the
   working method of the device.
   The main parts               of the         invention          are a         sliding platform,         an
30 optical        sensor,             side       guides         with         a     spring       system,     a
   controller,           a    document          locking         mechanism,            a protection      bar
   and a standard document reader.

                                              6
   One   of the main advantages            of the       invention    is   the   absence
   of friction between the            document        and the surrounding        parts,
   due to    the    fact   the   document      is    transferred     to   the   reading
   area on a sliding platform with no need for any sliding part
 5 placed on      top of the      document,        meaning    the   document      cannot
   become stuck to the part in question and undergo damage.
   The    invention       is    designed       so     documents     placed      on   the
   platform and transferred             (with the platform) to the reading
   position are always partially visible, enabling the user to
10 remove     the    document      during      the      reading/scanning        without
   causing any damage to the document or the equipment.
   The invention        can be installed immediately               above a     standard
   document reader, whereby the reading process is activated by
15 an   external      signal,     or    in   other       words,    the   document     is
   placed    on   the mechanism        by the       user,   whereby     this    and the
   collection      of    the   document      on     conclusion     of   the    scanning
   process    is   the    only involvement           of the   user    throughout     the
   scanning      process     .  The   manner       in   which    this   mechanism     is
20 installed      on   the    scanner    gives       the   user   the   sensation     of
   using    one   integrated      piece     of    equipment,      when   in   fact   two
   different mechanisms are being used.
   It is important to reiterate the work flow of the invention:
25
    -  The user places the document on the transparent platform;
    -   A    sensor      detects     the     document       and    the    transparent
   platform slides into the mechanism;
30
    -  A   linear     actuator    pins     the    document      to  the   transparent
   platform;
    -  The document is read by a standard document reader;

                                                       7
     -  After       reading           the     transparent        platform           transports          the
   document       back       to     the   initial      position       where        it   is    collected
   by the user.

   A detailed description of the invention
   As mentioned previously, this invention is a document feeder
   mechanism        for the          automatic        reading      of   documents,            activated

                                                8
   when the    user   places       a  document          on   the   platform         (1),    this
   being    the   only     human       intervention             in   relation          to     the
   process.    The documents         to be       read/scanned        may be         placed      on
   the  platform    in    any     position         (1)    provided      the     side      to    be
 5 read is facing down          (1).   A motion sensor             (13) is attached to
   the platform (1) and positioned in such a way it will detect
   any type of document, both flat and bulky.
   Once   the   optical     sensor       (13)      has     detected      the      document       a
10 horizontal     guide     (2)     using      a    system      of   springs         (9)    will
   place the document in the correct position.
   When the document        is   placed on the platform                  (1)    the spring
   operated    guide   (2)     moves     the      document       to  the     left      and the
15 platform moves into the position for reading the document.
   In  order to prevent         the document            from becoming         stuck in        the
   space under the mouth of the apparatus,                        the system has been
   designed so the      space between the platform                     (1)    and the base
20 of   document    feeder        is    equivalent           to    approximately             four
   sheets of paper.
   When   the   optical     sensor       (13)      detects       the   presence          of   the
   document it sends a signal to the controller                           (22), which, in
25 turn,    activates     the     linear        actuator         (4) by      means        of    an
   electric signal.
   The   linear    actuator         (4)     then       pins    the    document          to    the
   tempered    glass platform          (1)    with a        frictional       force       of   30N
30 to   prevent    the     passport          from       sliding     around         the     glass
   platform.    A linear       spring      (14)     also helps hold the document
   in position. Together with the linear actuators, this spring
   ensures    the   system       is    capable          of    handling       documents          of
   different thicknesses and textures.

                                                  9
   The force applied by the linear actuator                          (4) is specifically
   designed to hold the document firmly in place throughout the
   scanning process. Furthermore, the force applied enables the
 5 user   to   remove      the     document       in   the   middle      of    the   scanning
   process    without        damaging        the     same   or     the   linear      actuator
    (4).
   Preferably,        a part      of the      document      such as a marginal              edge
10 remains    accessible         to a user throughout the movement                      of the
   sliding platform,           so that        the passport          can be     retrieved by
   the user in the event of a malfunction.
   In   the   event       the      user    removes        the     document       during      the
15 scanning process, the platform (1) will automatically return
   to  the    initial       position        once      the   optical       sensor      (13)    no
   longer detects the presence of the document.
   A  protection        bar    (12)    is     attached      to    the    platform       (1)   to
20 prevent     foreign       objects        from      entering       the     equipment       and
   moves in time with the platform.
   As  soon   as the       document       is    in    the   correct      position      on    the
   platform      (1),    the      linear      actuator       (4)     sends     a   signal     to
25 activate     the motor         (6),   whereby the movement               is   transferred
   to  the platform          (1)    by means        of   a bobbin       (5)    which places
   the platform (1) in the position to read the document.
   As a means of ensuring the platform                      (1) does not move out of
30 position,       the      invention          features        side      guides       (3)     to
   guarantee       the      document         is      correctly        aligned,       applying
   minimal    friction       on the mechanism,             achieved by means            of two
   sets    of   parallel         bushings       (8),     one     on   each     side    of    the

                                                  10
   equipment,         in    addition         to      two    or     four     bearings           (20)
   positioned on the base on which the platform                            (1) rests.
   When     the  platform      (1)    reaches         the   reading     position         a  rigid
 5 piece      of  plastic       (11)     activates         the     end   position          sensor
    (10),    which,    in   turn,    activates          the   reading/scanning             of   the
   document.
   Bulky documents          are pinned         to    the   glass    platform        (1)    by the
10 pressure       applied       by     the       linear      actuator          (4)      and     the
   existence       of     longitudinal           guides       (7)    which       prevent        the
   natural tendency of the document to close.
   The      document      is   read      by     a      standard      reader        (21)     which
15 captures      infrared       and     ultraviolet           images      in     the     visible
   spectra,      guaranteeing        a   quality         which    enables       the     image     to
   be processed on a computer program.
   After     the  document       has   been      read,     the    reader       (21)     sends     an
20 electric      signal      of     confirmation           to    the   controller            (22),
   which      will     then    assume         the       scanning      process         has     been
   concluded       and     sends      an      electric        signal      to      the      linear
   actuator      (4),     which    then     releases       the    document        and     returns
   the platform         (1) to the initial position to enable the user
25 to collect the same from the platform                        (1).
