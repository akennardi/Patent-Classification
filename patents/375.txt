                                       ABSTRACT
Contemplated is a toe and foot protector made from flexible silicone in a variety of
colours. It is designed in two main sizes, adults and children, that is flexible and
stretchy to accommodate the size variation, and can also be made to size to
accommodate specific foot issues like bunions or larger sizes. It is designed as a
detached oval with either a mini sock like design to cover top and bottom of toes, or
imbedded within a cotton sock for comfort and practicality. Advantages provided are:
1. Protection of toes from tight squeezing shoes or non-soft soles;
2. Protection of arthritic feet from pain caused by tight pressing shoes;
3. A cheap alternative to arthritic friendly shoes that provide the same type of support
and low impact made from cheaper materials; and
4. Protection of shoes from constant tear because of growing feet and children's use.
