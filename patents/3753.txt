   ABSTRACT
   There is disclosed a drinking receptacle comprising: a container for containing a
   fluid for drinking; and an outlet member having an outlet through which the fluid is
   delivered under a pressure supplied by a user of the receptacle and a collar portion
 5 that attaches to an opening of the container such that an undersurface of the collar
   portion abuts with an upper surface of the opening of the container to form a
   substantially sealed engagement between the outlet member and the container;
   wherein either the undersurface of the collar portion or the upper surface of the
   opening of the container has at least one vent formed therein, the at least one vent
10 being configured such that when said pressure is applied to the outlet member the at
   least one vent member permits the controlled ingress of air into the container to
   facilitate flow of fluid from the outlet, and when said pressure is removed the at
   least one vent member substantially prevents the ingress of air into the container to
   facilitate a controlled vacuum pressure within the container.

   RELATED APPLICATION(S)
   The present invention claims priority from Australian Provisional Patent
   Application No. 2013901742 filed 16 May 2013, the entire contents of which are
 5 incorporated herein by reference. This application is a divisional of Australian
   Patent Application No. 2014268123, the entire content of which is incorporated
   herein by reference.
   FIELD OF INVENTION
   The present invention relates generally to the field of drinking receptacles, and in
10 particular, to drinking receptacles for dispensing fluid for drinking purposes from an
   outlet by way of a sucking action applied to the outlet by a drinker. In a particular
   application, the present invention relates to an infant feeding bottle.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Drinking receptacles come in a variety of different shapes and forms, depending
1s upon the specific needs of the user. Generally, most drinking receptacles comprise a
   storage or bottle portion into which fluid is stored for drinking, and an outlet either
   attachable to the storage or bottle portion or formed in the storage or bottle portion,
   through which the fluid is able to flow to the user. The manner in which fluid flows
   from the storage or bottle portion through the outlet portion can also vary, with
20 some outlet portions being configured to allow for liquid to freely flow therefrom,
   whilst others only permit fluid to flow from the outlet portion when a suction force
   is applied to the outlet portion.
   A common type of receptacle that releases fluid upon the application of a suction
   force to an outlet is an infant feeding bottle. Infant feeding bottles generally
25 comprise a cylindrical body portion for containing the fluid, such as expressed milk
   or infant formula, and a flexible teat portion attachable to an opening of the
   cylindrical body portion which is configured to be placed in the infant's mouth to
   release fluid to the infant as the infant applies suction to the teat portion. In this
   regard, most infant feeding bottles are based on the principal of replicating as close
30 as possible a natural breast feeding situation, and as such, a variety of different
   shapes and styles of teats have been proposed in an attempt to more naturally
   replicate the process.
   In most conventional infant feeding bottles, the teat portion is generally formed of
                                               1

   two parts, a flexible teat and a collar. The flexible teat is typically made from an
   elastomeric material, such as silicone, TPE or similar material having an opening
   formed therein through which the fluid can flow and a flange formed around a
   perimeter of the material. In order to assemble the flexible teat to the cylindrical
 5 bottle, the flexible teat is typically placed over the opening to the cylindrical bottle
   such that the flange is positioned on the rim of the bottle and the collar portion is
   then placed over the flexible teat and screwed onto the cylindrical bottle such that
   the flange is captured between the collar and the rim of the bottle.
   Such a conventional two-piece arrangement is able to be disassembled for cleaning
10 and sterilisation purposes, which requires unnecessary handling of multiple parts by
   the user. Further, given the nature of the flexible, elastomeric material of the flange
   being sandwiched between two hard surfaces, namely the rim of the bottle and the
   collar portion, it is common that upon assembling the device for use, it is often
   overtightened in the process. This can have a significant negative effect on the flow
15 of fluid from the teat, as the arrangement becomes air tight and air cannot enter the
   bottle to replace the fluid exiting the teat portion, significantly reducing the fluid
   flow.
   Thus, there is a need to provide a receptacle having an outlet portion that facilitates
   improved flow of fluid therefrom. Also, when used as an infant feeding bottle, there
20 is a need to provide a receptacle that is more naturally received within the infant's
   mouth and which provides for controlled delivery of fluid therefrom due to the
   natural sucking action applied by the infant.
   The above references to and descriptions of prior proposals or products are not
   intended to be, and are not to be construed as, statements or admissions of common
25 general knowledge in the art. In particular, the above prior art discussion does not
   relate to what is commonly or well known by the person skilled in the art, but assists
   in the understanding of the inventive step of the present invention of which the
   identification of pertinent prior art proposals is but one part.
   STATEMENT OF INVENTION
30 The invention according to one or more aspects is as defined in the independent
   claims. Some optional and/or preferred features of the invention are defined in the
   dependent claims.
   According to a first aspect, the present invention provides a drinking receptacle
   comprising: a container for containing a fluid for drinking; and an outlet member
35 having an outlet through which the fluid is delivered to a drinker under pressure and
                                                2

   a collar portion that attaches to an opening of the container such that an
   undersurface of the collar portion abuts with an upper surface of the opening of the
   container to form a substantially sealingly engagement between the outlet member
   and the container; wherein either the undersurface of the collar portion or the upper
 5 surface of the opening of the container has at least one vent formed therein, the at
   least one vent being configured such that when said pressure to the fluid to facilitate
   delivery of the fluid from the outlet, the at least one vent member permits the
   controlled ingress of air into the container to facilitate flow of fluid from the outlet
   and when the pressure is removed, the at least one vent member substantially
10 prevents the ingress of air into the container to facilitate a controlled vacuum
   pressure within the container.
   In one embodiment the pressure applied to facilitate delivery of fluid from the
   container via the outlet is a negative or vacuum pressure, which may be facilitated
   by a suction force applied to the outlet. In another embodiment, the pressure
15 applied to facilitate delivery of fluid from the container via the outlet is a positive
   pressure, which may be facilitated by squeezing the container.
   The at least one vent may be in the form of one or more channels formed in the
   undersurface of the collar portion or the upper surface of the opening of the
   container such that the channel extends across the abutting surfaces of the collar
20 portion and the opening of the container. The abutting surfaces of the collar portion
   and the opening of the container may be made from a substantially rigid material
   having minimal flexibility so as to form a hard-to-hard surface engagement. In one
   embodiment, the substantially rigid material may be a hard plastic material, such as
   polypropylene.
25 According to a second aspect, the present invention provides a dispensing unit for
   an infant feeding bottle, comprising: a flexible teat portion configured to be at least
   partially received within the infants mouth; and a collar portion configured to be
   attachable to the infant feeding bottle; wherein both the flexible teat portion and the
   collar portion are integrally formed such that the internal surface of the unit is
30 substantially continuous.
   According to a third aspect, the present invention provides a teat portion for an
   infant feeding bottle, comprising: a body made from flexible material, the body
   having an upper surface configured to have a curvature that substantially conforms
   with the curvature of the infant's hard palate and a substantially flat bottom surface
35 configured to receive the infant's tongue during feeding.
   With regard to the third aspect of the invention, an orifice is located at a distal end
   of the body such that when the body is taken into the mouth of the infant, the orifice
                                              3

   is positioned to deliver fluid at the hard/soft palate interface of the infant's mouth.
   According to a fourth aspect, there is provided a teat portion for an infant feeding
   bottle comprising a body made from substantially flexible material, the body being
   configured to be received within the infant's mouth during use and comprising an
 5 upper concave surface and a lower concave surface and an outlet located at a distal
   end of the body for delivering fluid to the infant, wherein the point of inflection of
   the upper concave surface is offset closer to the outlet that the point of inflection of
   the lower concave surface.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
   Preferred features of the present invention will now be described with particular
   reference to the accompanying drawings. However, it is to be understood that the
20 features illustrated in and described with reference to the drawings are not to be
   construed as limiting on the scope of the invention.
   The present invention will be described below in relation to its application to an
   infant feeding bottle. However, it will be appreciated that the present invention
   could be equally applied to a variety of drinking receptacles that rely upon the
25 application of a suction force to an outlet thereof to extract fluid.
   Referring to Figure 1 a receptacle 10 is depicted in accordance with an embodiment
   of the present invention. The receptacle 10 is in the form of an infant feeding bottle
   comprising a cylindrical bottle portion 12 and an outlet portion 16. The cylindrical
   bottle portion 12 is circular in cross section and has a base 13, side walls 14 and an
30 open upper portion 15, to which the outlet portion 16 is mounted. The bottle portion
   12 is made from a hard plastic material which may be clear or coloured for aesthetic
                                               -5

   purposes. In the embodiment as shown, the upper portion 15 is narrower than the
   body of the bottle portion 12; however, it will be appreciated that other shapes and
   configurations of the bottle portion are also envisaged and fall within the spirit of
   the present invention.
 5 An embodiment of the outlet portion 16 is shown in more detail in Fig. 2. The
   outlet portion 16 is formed as a single piece that comprises a teat member 17 made
   from a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), such as styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene
   (SEBS) or may be made from a flexible silicone rubber material. The outlet portion
    16 also comprises a collar member 18 made from a hard plastic material, such as
10 polypropylene. As is shown, the lower portion of the teat member 17 is formed over
   the outer surface of the collar member 18 such that the two members become an
   integral piece thereby having a substantially continuous inner surface. An outlet 19
   is formed in the upper end of the teat portion 17, as shown, and functions in a
   manner as will be described in more detail below.
15 The outlet portion 16 is fitted to the upper portion 15 of the bottle 12 by way of an
   internal thread 20 formed on the collar member 18. The internal thread 20 engages
   with an external thread formed on the upper portion of the bottle 12 to facilitate
   secure attachment of the outlet portion 16 to the bottle portion 12 of the receptacle
    10, as is shown in Fig.1. In this arrangement, as the upper portion 15 of the bottle 12
20 is open, fluid present in the bottle 12 is able to flow into the teat member 17 of the
   outlet portion 16 to substantially fill the internal space therein, so as to be delivered
   to the infant by way of the outlet 19, when a sucking motion is applied to the teat
   member 17 by the infant, as is shown in Fig. 3.
   The teat member 17 is configured to assume a predetermined position within the
25 infant's mouth when the infant initially receives the teat member 17. This position
   is similar to a position assumed by the breast and nipple during natural breast
   feeding. In this regard, the teat member 17 is self positioned within the infant's
   mouth into a desired position to provide a consistent and reproducible feeding
   experience each time the receptacle is used. Fig. 3 depicts the manner in which the
30 receptacle 10 of the present invention is configured to facilitate flow of fluid from
   the bottle portion 12, through the outlet portion 16 and into the mouth of the infant.
   In this regard, upon the infant taking the teat member 17 into their mouth, the upper
   lip of the infant sits naturally against the corresponding region of the teat member as
   the upper lip flattens and pushes forward. This action results in the teat member 17
35 extending beyond the infant's alveolar ridge 2, towards the rear of the infant's hard
   palate, as shown. In this position, the infant is able to apply a suction force to the
   teat member 17 to draw fluid from the outlet 19. As part of this natural sucking
                                                 6

   action, the infant's bottom jaw typically lowers to enable the infant's tongue to
   extend forward and sit naturally against the underside of the teat member 17, as
   shown, thereby applying a seal at this region against the teat member 17. It will be
   appreciated that a natural sucking action requires a seal formed between the lips,
 5 tongue and inner cheek, when the jaw moves downwards. In a normal breast
   feeding situation, the breast and nipple are able to naturally conform to the infant's
   mouth, which is the naturally action that the present invention is seeking to
   replicate.
   During use, the teat member 17 undergoes relatively little deformation and
10 maintains its general configuration. Thus, in order to take advantage of the natural
   feeding action of the infant, so as to self-position within the infant's mouth, the side
   profile of the teat member 17 of the present invention has been configured
   accordingly, as is shown in Figs. 4A and 4B.
   In Fig. 4A, the teat member 17 has a concave upper surface 21 and a concave lower
1s surface 23. However, the point of inflection (POI) 22 of the concave upper surface
   21 is offset a distance 'X' from the POI 24 of the concave lower surface 23. As is
   shown, the POI 22 of the concave upper surface 21 is disposed closer to the orifice
   19 than the POI 24 of the concave lower surface 23. Such an arrangement enables
   the teat member 17 to be shaped such that when it is taken by the infant, the upper
20 surface of the teat member 17 is able to clearly pass below the infant's alveolar
   ridge 2 such that the end region of the teat member is able to extend into the infant's
   mouth to rest against the infant's hard palate in a similar manner to natural breast
   feeding, as is shown in Fig. 3.
   The flatter configuration of the concave lower surface 23, due in the main to the
25 POI 24 being more distal the orifice 19 that the POI 22 of the concave upper surface
   21, ensures that the infant's tongue is presented with a flatter surface against which
   they can readily place their tongue to form a seal against the concave lower surface
   23 as is also shown in Fig. 3. This enables the infant to form a latching vacuum
   about the teat member 17 is a more natural manner.
30 As well as the side profile of the teat member 17 being configured to facilitate a
   more natural and readily repeatable position within the infant's mouth for feeding,
   the end profile of the teat member is also configured to provide an improved feeding
   experience for the infant. This is depicted in Fig. 5A and 5B.
   In Fig. 5A, the outlet portion 16 is shown from a top perspective view with the end
35 portion of the teat member 17 removed. The end portion of the teat member 17 is
                                               7

   shown in cross sectional view in Fig. 5B. As can be readily appreciated, the under
   surface 25 of the teat member 17 is configured to be substantially flat in comparison
   with the upper surface 26, which has a substantially consistent curvature. The
   curvature of the upper surface 26 is configured to substantially match the curvature
 5 of the hard palate 5 of the infant, as is shown in Fig. 6. Similarly, the flatter
   configuration of the under surface 25 provides a surface against which the infant's
   tongue is able to rest against to enable the tongue to be flatter so as to more easily
   make contact with the infant's cheeks during the feeding session.
   Referring to Fig. 6, the manner in which the end profile of the teat member 17 has
1o been configured to improve the feeding action of the receptacle 10 can be seen. In
   this regard, during a sucking motion, the infant's cheeks are drawn in, in the
   direction of arrow 'A' such that they are able to contact each side of the infant's
   tongue to create a seal and vacuum about the teat member 17. At the same time,
   during the sucking stroke, the infant's jaw and tongue is able to move in a
15 downward direction (arrow 'B'). By providing a flatter under surface 25, the teat
   member 17 does not prevent the infant's cheeks from contact with the tongue
   thereby ensuring that the seal and vacuum is maintained during the sucking motion
   to ensure that optimum fluid is delivered from the outlet 19 of the teat member 17,
   so as to replicate a more natural breast feeding action. As the upper surface 26 of
20 the teat member 17 is configured to match the curvature of the infant's hard palate;
   the infant is able to sealingly engage with the teat member 17 in a desirable manner,
   and in a manner that is consistently reproducible each time the teat member is taken
   by the infant.
   As well as providing a teat member 17 that functions to better replicate a natural
25 breast feeding situation when the teat member is present in the infant's mouth, the
   present invention also provides a system that ensures improved fluid flow from the
   teat member.
   As most drinking receptacles require a degree of sealing to avoid inadvertent fluid
   leakage from the receptacle, it is important that, when the receptacle is in use, there
30 is sufficient venting of air into the receptacle to ensure that fluid is able to flow from
   the outlet of the receptacle.
   For an infant feeding bottle, this is particularly the case as the infant typically
   supplies significant suction to the teat member during use to extract the fluid
   therefrom, and in order to replace the fluid taken, air must enter the bottle to
35 accommodate the vacant space. Thus, in providing an infant feeding bottle, it is
   important that there is present a degree of vacuum within the bottle to enable the
                                                8

   infant to apply a natural latching action during rest periods and/or suction force to
   the bottle to extract the fluid during feeding periods. This ensures that the feeding
   situation resembles as close as possible, a natural breast feeding situation.
   As previously discussed a common problem with conventional infant feeding bottles
 5 that employ a teat member and separate collar is that, in the act of fastening the teat
   member to the bottle portion when assembling the components of the device, the
   arrangement is typically over-tightened. Generally, where the teat member is
   employed with a removable collar, the collar and the upper rim of the bottle portion
   function to secure the flange portion of the flexible teat member therebetween, so as
10 to facilitate secure engagement of the various components. As the bottle is often
   shaken after assembly to facilitate mixing of the milk product, there is a natural
   tendency to screw the collar more tightly than necessary to the bottle portion such
   that the soft and flexible flange member deforms between the two hard surfaces of
   the collar and the bottle, to form a substantially air-tight seal. This air-tight seal
1s may be useful in preventing inadvertent leakage of fluid from the bottle, but it also
   prevents air from entering the bottle during feeding and thus prevents desired flow
   of fluid from the bottle to the infant.
   The present invention addresses this problem by providing a one-part outlet portion
    16 as discussed above in relation to Fig. 2. By providing the flexible teat member
20  17 such that it is moulded over the hard collar member 18 as shown, when the outlet
   portion 16 is attached to the upper rim 15 of the bottle portion 12, there is no soft,
   flexible material being sandwiched between the hard collar member 18 and the hard
   upper rim of the bottle portion 12. Rather, the collar member 18 and the bottle
   portion 12, which are both made from a hard plastic material, are able to be tightly
25 screwed together without fear of the seal between the two components becoming
   airtight and preventing the receptacle from being able to vent during use.
   As is shown in Fig. 7, in accordance with the present invention, venting of the
   receptacle 10 when assembled is primarily achieved through the provision of
   multiple grooves 30 formed in the undersurface of the collar member 18 of the
30 outlet portion 16. In the embodiment as shown, each of these grooves 30 are
   formed in the horizontally extended portion 18a of the collar member 18 such that
   they form small channels that extend across the surface thereby forming a gap, even
   when the collar member 18 is securely tightened to the bottle portion 12 and the
   upper rim of the bottle portion 12 is in direct contact with the horizontally extending
35 portion 18a of the collar member. In this regard, the grooves 30 have a length that
   is greater than the width of the upper rim of the bottle portion 12 to provide a path
   for air to pass from the region external of the bottle portion 12 to the internal region
                                               9

   of the bottle portion.
   Referring to Figs. 8A and 8B, the arrangement of the grooves 30 are depicted in
   more detail. As is shown in Fig. 8A, in a preferred form, the grooves 30 extend
   along a section of the horizontally extended portion 18a of the collar member 18 so
 5 as to subtend an arc of angle 0. The angle 0 may be an angle of 450, although other
   angles are also envisaged. In a preferred form, each of the grooves 30 is also
   regularly spaced apart in the manner as shown to form a venting section of the collar
   member 18, although irregular spacing is also envisaged.
   As is shown in Fig. 8B, the grooves 30 are formed in the surface of the horizontally
1o extended portion 18a of the collar member 18 so as to have a depth 'Y' and a width
   'Z'. In a preferred form, the depth 'Y' may be between around 0.03mm - 0.20mm,
   preferably around 0.08mm and the width 'Z' may vary between 0.10mm to 1.00mm,
   preferably around 0.20mm. Further, the width 'Z' may vary along the length of the
   groove, with the width being wider at one end compared to the other. It will be
15 appreciated that the purpose of the grooves 30 is to permit the ingress of air into the
   bottle portion of the receptacle and to prevent the leakage of fluid from the bottle
   portion, and as such, the dimensions of the groove are sufficient to achieve that
   purpose. It is preferable that the grooves are provided in the section of the collar
   member that faces upwards when the receptacle is in use, to ensure that the air is
20 able to more freely enter the bottle portion and to reduce the likelihood of any
   leakage occurring through effects of fluid head pressure.
   The number of grooves 30 provided on the collar member 18 may vary, and in a
   preferred form, four grooves 30 are provided. It has been found that the grooves 30
   function to form a vent when a suction force is applied to the teat member 17. In
25 this regard, due to the configuration of the grooves, in the absence of a suction force
   being applied to the teat portion 17, a vacuum is maintained within the bottle as the
   grooves 30 have a configuration that ensures the surface tension of the fluid at the
   grooves 30 is maintained to reduce the likelihood of fluid, namely air or milk,
   passing through the grooves. As a suction force is applied to the teat portion 17 by
30 the infant, the surface tension at one or more of the grooves 30 is broken thereby
   allowing air to enter into the bottle through the grooves to replace the fluid exiting
   the outlet 19 of the teat portion 17. Once the suction force is removed the surface
   tension at the grooves is maintained to ensure that a degree of vacuum force is still
   present within the receptacle. In this regard, there is a redundancy in the number of
35 grooves or vents 30 provided and if a high degree of suction force is applied to the
   teat portion more than one groove 30 may "open" to enable air to enter the bottle.
   By altering the dimensions of the grooves 30, i.e. by making the grooves 30 deeper
                                              10

   or wider, the amount of vacuum present in the bottle can be altered.
   It will be appreciated that the purpose of the grooves 30 is to provide a degree of
   venting to the receptacle to ensure that receptacles that employ the arrangement of
   the present invention all exhibit a consistent flow characteristic. This is different to
 5 the flow rate of the receptacle, which is determined by the size of the outlet 19
   formed in the teat member 17. By altering the orifice size of the outlet 19 differing
   flow rates of fluid can be delivered to the infant. Thus, for a given orifice size, the
   grooves 30 of the venting system of the present invention provide a consistent flow
   characteristic between receptacles and ensure that there will always be an inherent
1o vacuum within the receptacle which will be broken upon application of a sucking
   force to the teat member 17, to ensure that fluid will flow to the infant as a result of
   the sucking force.
   Referring to Figures 9A and 9B, the manner in which the venting of the receptacle is
   achieved can be readily understood. The cross-section depiction of Fig. 9A shows
15 the manner in which the outlet portion 16 is engaged with the open upper portion 15
   of the bottle 12, such that the upper rim of the open upper portion 15 of the bottle 12
   is in contact with the surface of the horizontal portion 18a of collar member 18.
   In the enlarged view of this arrangement as shown in Fig. 9B, when the collar
   member 18 is screwed tightly in position onto the upper rim of the open upper
20 portion 15 of the bottle 12, air is still able to enter the interior space within the teat
   member 17 by following the path depicted by the arrow 'G' as determined by
   groove 30. As discussed above, in a normal state where no suction is applied to the
   teat member 17, the fluid within the bottle is enclosed within a vacuum, and as such
   the surface tension of the fluid is sufficient to prevent air passing through the
25 grooves 30. When a suction force is applied to the teat member 17, the fluid within
   the teat member 17 is typically removed under suction, thereby breaking the surface
   tension of the grooves 30 and drawing air into the teat member 17 through the vents
   30. Such an arrangement ensures that the fluid is able to flow from the outlet in the
   teat member 17 in a desired manner, without creating a vacuum effect in the
30 receptacle 10.
   It will also be appreciated that rather than grooves 30 formed in the underside of the
   horizontal surface 18a of the collar portion 18, the venting can be achieved by
   variations in the surface finish of the underside of the horizontal surface 18a. This
   could be formed by etching, EDM or any other surface roughening techniques.
35 It will be appreciated that in each of the embodiments described above and as
                                                11

   depicted in Figs. 7 - 9b, the surfaces between the bottle portion 12 and the collar
   portion 18a which contact are relatively smooth and free of debris which enables the
   grooves or vents 30 to function substantially unimpeded. However, with the
   provision of pre-prepared or pre-mixed fluid as an option, it is possible that the
 5 bottle portion 12 may be provided separately to the outlet portion 16 and assembled
   together upon purchase. In this regard, it is possible that a removable tamper proof
   seal may be applied to the opening of the bottle portion 12 such that it must be
   removed prior to assembling the outlet portion 16 to the bottle portion 12. In such
   instances, the tamper proof seal may be applied to the upper rim of the bottle portion
10 with an adhesive, such that after removal of the tamper proof seal the surface of the
   upper rim of the bottle portion may be rough which could block the vents or grooves
   30 when the bottle portion 12 is in engagement with the outlet portion 16. To
   address this issue, variations of the manner in which the venting of the receptacle 10
   is achieved are depicted in Figs. 10 - 13.
15 With regard to the embodiment depicted in Figs. 10A and 10B, in order to assist in
   the achievement of venting, a step 35 is formed in the rim of the open upper portion
   15 of the bottle which cooperates with a corresponding step 34 formed in the
   underside of the horizontal surface 18a of the collar portion 18. In this arrangement,
   the one or more grooves 30 are formed in the surface 18a as depicted above, such
20 that even if a tamper proof seal is applied to the surface 15a of the upper rim 15 of
   the bottle portion 12, the receptacle will still be vented when the outlet portion 16 is
   fitted to the bottle 12. In this regard, a clearance 'W' is created between the surface
   15a and the collar portion 18 to cater for any potential adhesive residue or the like
   that may be left behind when the tamper proof seal is removed and which may
25 potentially block the grooves 30. As the grooves 30 are formed in the surface 18a
   of the collar 18 and surface 18a is not in direct contact with the surface 15a which
   the tamper proof seal was attached to, venting of the receptacle is assured in this
   instance even if debris remains on the surface 15a after the tamper proof seal has
   been removed.
30 With regard to the embodiment depicted in Figs. llA and 1IB, a variation of the
   arrangement shown in Figs. 10A and 1OB is depicted. In this embodiment, in order
   to achieve venting, a step 37 is formed in the rim of the open upper portion 15 of the
   bottle which cooperates with a corresponding step 36 formed in the underside of the
   horizontal surface 18a of the collar portion 18. In such an arrangement, a tamper
35 proof seal may be attached to the upper surface 15a of the open upper rim portion 15
   of the bottle 12 and can be removed prior to assembling the outlet portion 16 to the
   bottle portion 12 as shown in Fig. llA. As discussed above, after removal of a
                                                12

   tamper proof seal from the surface 15a, there may be residual debris remaining on
   the surface 15a which could potentially block any groove or vent provided on a
   surface of the collar portion 18 that comes into contact with the surface 15a. To
   address this, the grooves are provided in the surface 18a of the collar portion 18
 5 which does not come into contact with the surface 15a of the upper rim portion 15
   of the bottle 12 and a clearance 'W1' is created above the surface 15a to cater for
   any residual debris that may remain thereon after removal of the tamper proof seal.
   With regard to the embodiment depicted in Figs. 12A and 12B, yet another variation
   of the arrangement described above is depicted.        In this embodiment, a tamper
1o proof seal may be applied to the surface 15a of the upper rim portion 15 such that
   upon removal of the tamper proof seal the surface 15a may contain residual debris
   that may block any grooves or vents that may come into contact with it. In order to
   address this, a lug 38 is provided on the collar 18 to extend in a downward manner
   so as to penetrate into the open upper portion 15 of the bottle, as shown in Fig. 12B.
15 The inner surface of the open upper portion 15 of the bottle is angled to
   substantially conform to the outer surface of the lug 38 and the grooves or vents 30
   are formed on the outer surface 18a of the lug 38. In this arrangement the grooves
   or vents 30 do not come into contact with the surface 15a and a clearance W2 is
   created above the surface 15a as shown.
20 With regard to the embodiment depicted in Figs. 13A and 13B, yet another variation
   of the arrangements described above is depicted. In this embodiment, in order to
   achieve venting, the mating surfaces of the collar portion 18 and the open upper
   portion 15 of the bottle are angled to define a venting path therebetween. The inner
   horizontal surface 15a of the open upper portion 15 of the bottle portion 12 may
25 have a tamper proof seal applied thereto which, when removed, may have residual
   debris formed thereon which may potentially block or adversely interfere with any
   grooves or vents formed on a surface of the collar portion 18 that engages therewith.
   To address this, grooves are provided in the surface 18a of the collar portion 18 that
   is remote from the surface 15a to ensure venting of the bottle portion is still
30 possible, even in the event of the surface 15a containing debris. Clearance W3 is
   also formed over the surface 15a as shown.
   It will be appreciated that in each of the embodiments discussed above for venting
   the receptacle, the grooves are provided in the underside of the collar portion to
   provide a passage for air to enter the internal region of the receptacle to replace the
35 space filled by the departing fluid. This is achieved without creating fluid leakage
   by controlling the depth and size of the grooves. This receptacles incorporating the
   venting arrangement of the present invention provide a consistent flow characteristic
                                              13

   between receptacles that ensure that a natural vacuum is present in the receptacle
   when not in use, and when in use and a suction force is applied to the receptacle to
   withdraw fluid therefrom, venting is possible to ensure that the vacuum is broken
   and fluid flow is possible. However, the flow rate of the receptacle is generally
 5 determined by the size of the orifice of the outlet. Receptacles having the above
   described venting arrangement do not leak when turned upside down due to the size
   and shape of the grooves ensuring that there is sufficient surface tension present
   between the fluid and air interface to prevent inadvertent leakage of fluid therefrom.
   This is achieved even if the receptacle is upside down whereby the effect of gravity
10 is not enough to overcome the tension forces present therein. As such, in order for
   the receptacle to vent and release fluid, a pressure needs to be applied to the
   receptacle.
   It will be appreciated that whilst the above invention has been discussed above in
   relation to infant feeding bottles, the same principles can be applied when used with
15 sports drinking bottles or other receptacles which employ an outlet portion that
   releases the fluid, under pressure, in a controlled manner.
