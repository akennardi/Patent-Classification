                                         ABSTRACT
        A system, method, and computer-readable storage medium configured to enable
commodity voucher transactions. There is provided a method of processing an electronic
voucher transaction. The method comprises reading electronic voucher information with
an electronic voucher interface, the electronic voucher information containing: a
cardholder identifier, and a number of unredeemed electronic vouchers. The method then
totals, with a processor, a number of goods or services to be redeemed with an electronic
voucher. The number of vouchers required to redeem the number of goods or services
with the processor is calculated. The number of unredeemed electronic vouchers and the
calculated number of vouchers required to redeem the number of goods or services are
compared with the processor. The method denies, with the processor, the electronic
voucher transaction when the number of unredeemed electronic vouchers is less than the
calculated number of vouchers required to redeem the number of goods or services.

                                         BACKGROUND
Field of the Disclosure
         [0001] Aspects of the disclosure relate in general to financial services. Aspects
include an apparatus, system, method and computer-readable storage medium to enable
commodity voucher transactions.
Description of the Related Art
         [0002] For centuries, financial transactions have used currency, such as banknotes
and coins. In modem times, however, payment cards are rapidly replacing cash to
facilitate payments. A payment card is a card that can be used by an accountholder and
accepted by a vendor or merchant to make a payment for a purchase or in payment of
some other obligation. An example of a payment card includes a stored-value card (such
as a transit card or gift card), credit card, debit card, automatic teller machine (ATM) card,
or charge card.
         [0003] Payment cards are affiliated with payment networks, which are operational
networks that enable monetary exchange between parties.
         [0004] While payment cards are increasingly used throughout the world, globally
there remain 2.5 billion adults who are currently excluded from the formal financial
system. In addition, while (in 2011) cross-border funders committed at least US$25 billion
to microfinance or financial services for the poor, over 200 million micro-to-medium
enterprises in developing economies lack access to affordable financial services and credit.

                                               2
        [0005] In a non-financial context, a voucher is a certificate or bond that is worth a
certain value. For example, vouchers may be used for housing, travel, or food.
                                         SUMMARY
        [0006] Embodiments include a system, device, method and computer-readable
medium to enable commodity voucher transactions.
        [0007] In a method of processing an electronic voucher transaction, electronic
voucher information is read with an electronic voucher interface. The electronic voucher
information contains a cardholder identifier, and a number of unredeemed electronic
vouchers. A processor totals a number of goods or services to be redeemed with an
electronic voucher, calculates the number of vouchers required to redeem the number of
goods or services, and compares the number of unredeemed electronic vouchers and the
calculated number of vouchers required to redeem the number of goods or services. The
processor denies the electronic voucher transaction when the number of unredeemed
electronic vouchers is less than the calculated number of vouchers required to redeem the
number of goods or services.

                                                3
                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         [0014] One aspect of the disclosure includes the realization that a payment
processor may be used to enable commodity voucher transactions. Such transactions
include restricted commodity vouchers, restricted cash vouchers, and network restricted
cash vouchers.
         [0015] In another aspect of the disclosure, a payment processor may be used to
facilitate secure financial transactions involving vouchers.
         [0016] Another aspect of the disclosure includes the realization that a payment
network system may be used to provide restricted commodity vouchers or restricted cash
vouchers. Such a system leverages a payment network to track and report, rather than
process payments. Such a system may be used to provide restricted commodity vouchers
or restricted cash vouchers for non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
         [0017] An aspect of the disclosure includes the understanding that many aid
recipients that receive vouchers are illiterate, rendering conventional password or personal
identification number (PIN) techniques ineffective.
         [0018] A further aspect of the disclosure is the realization that aid vouchers may be
used to train aid recipients on using the modern financial system. Electronic vouchers may
be used as the gateway to using payment cards and payment accounts by former aid
recipients.
         [0019] Embodiments of the present disclosure include a system, method, and
computer-readable storage medium configured to enable commodity voucher transactions.
In some embodiments, vouchers may be used as electronic cash vouchers.
         [0020] In some embodiments, a system is configured to enable trading of restricted
commodity vouchers, restricted cash vouchers, and network restricted cash vouchers.
         [0021] FIG. 1 depicts an electronic voucher transaction system 1000 configured to
process non-monetary transactions, and to perform financial transactions that traverse a
Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) network 1100 with a payment network 6000,
constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.
         [0022] The system described herein enables electronic vouchers 100 (e-Voucher or
e-voucher), which can be embodied as electronic voucher cards 100a or electronic voucher
devices 100b. Electronic voucher cards 100a or electronic voucher devices 100b may be
distributed by NGOs to aid recipients. While embodiments described herein are described

                                                4
in an NGO aid context, it is understood that the technology and embodiments may have
other applications, such as healthcare, transit, agriculture, social benefits or other closed
loop or semi-closed-loop voucher applications.
         [0023] As shown in FIG. 2, an electronic voucher card 100a is a physical card,
constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.
Electronic voucher card 100a is similar to a conventional payment card and may be
encoded with a magnetic stripe on the opposite side (not shown) or contain a chip encoded
with electronic voucher information. The electronic voucher information may include the
number of unredeemed vouchers and an electronic image of the aid recipient. The
electronic image of the aid recipient may be a Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), Joint
Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), or other image format known in the art.
Additionally, the electronic voucher card 100a may have a photograph 102 of the aid
recipient to provide another verification of the aid recipient's identity. The photograph 102
may be the same image as the electronic image or an alternate image.
         [0024] An electronic voucher device 100b may be an electronic wallet, mobile
phone, tablet computer, or virtual account device capable of storing an electronic voucher.
An example electronic voucher device 100b embodiment will be described in greater
depth below.
         [0025] An aid recipient may use an electronic voucher 100 at selected merchants
11 Oa-b approved by the NGO. The NGO may restrict the electronic vouchers for a
selected basket of goods or selections from the merchant 1110.
         [0026] Because the merchants 1110 may be located in a disaster-stricken area with
unreliable communication with the NGO network 1100, the electronic voucher transaction
occurs using the electronic voucher and an NGO mobile point-of-sale (POS) device 1112.
At the time of a voucher transaction, the number of unredeemed vouchers and the
electronic image are read by or transmitted to the NGO mobile point-of-sale device 1112.
The merchant 1110 then uses the electronic image to verify the identity of the aid recipient
and provides the goods or services specified by the voucher program. Alternatively, in
embodiments that use an electronic voucher device 100b, aid recipients may be asked to
type in a visual personal identification image (VPII), an authentication using pictograph or
image selection or sequence. The VPII is selected by the aid recipient in advance of the
voucher transaction. During authentication, the aid recipient selects the images that
constitute the VPII. In some embodiments, the VPII may require images to be selected
sequentially; in other embodiments, the selection of images need not be sequential, but all

                                                5
the images of the VPII must be identified. The images or pictographs used may vary from
one disaster-relief area to another. In yet other embodiments, a numeric personal
identification number (PIN) may be used. Embodiments may adopt a combination of
authentication solutions, such as photo identification and a numeric PIN, for example.
         [0027] In alternate embodiments, where direct communication with the NGO
network is possible, NGO may distribute electronic vouchers to aid recipients for use at
NGO-approved merchants 11 Oa-b, and ATMs 1 120a-c. Transactions that take place
within entities connected to the NGO network 1100 are processed by NGO network 1100
and its voucher transaction management system 5140.
         [0028] In parallel, payment network 6000 also processes financial transactions on
an interbank network 2100, where payment card acquirer financial institutions 2200
("acquirer") and issuer financial institutions 2300 ("issuer") may be connected.
         [0029] Payment network 6000 is a payment network capable of processing
payments electronically over NGO network 1100. An example payment network 6000
includes MasterCard International Incorporated of Purchase, New York. Payment network
6000 may analyze and score financial transactions for the probability of fraud. The
transaction scores may be expressed as a probability of fraud from zero (entirely
fraudulent) to one (100% chance of no fraud), or scored between zero (fraudulent) and
1,000 (100% not fraudulent).
         [0030] An acquirer 2200 is a bank, credit union, or other financial institution
configured to process transaction data from merchants 211 Oa-b and prepares authorization
formatted data for the payment network 6000. Merchants 2110 are any vendors that accept
payment cards or payment accounts.
         [0031] An issuer 2300 is the bank, credit union, or other financial institution that
provides the credit for the financial payment transaction. Issuer 2300 processes data
(authorization requests), forwarded from the acquirer 2200 by interbank network 2100,
and prepares the authorization formatted response (approvals/declines). In the following
description, issuer 2300 acts as a program manager for a NGO payment network. A
program manager is an entity, such as the non-governmental organization, that provides
the aid voucher/token or other representation of the aid. Program manager contracts with a
merchant 1110 to redeem the voucher, compensating merchant 1110 for their services, and
sets the conditions for the voucher program. In the following example, issuer 2300 is a
program manager. It is understood that in some embodiments, a program manager and

                                               6
issuer may be different entities. In some embodiments, issuer 2300 may be directly
connected to the NGO network 1100.
         [0032] In addition, automated teller machines 2120a-b may also be coupled to
interbank network 2100.
         [0033] Electronic vouchers leverage a payment network embodiment where the
infrastructure embodiment is used for tracking and reporting rather than payment. In such
an embodiment, transactions do not move money; instead, the embodiment leverages a
payments infrastructure to track and report on data and information flows. In other words,
there is no payment settlement over the network.
         [0034] In such an embodiment, an open payment network:
    *    Does not require payment sanctioning for acquiring and issuing entities;
    *    Does not require fiduciary accounts;
    * Allows for open competition because the network uses standard and open protocol;
         and,
    *    Less need for regulatory challenges as there is no need to monitor and regulate the
         movement of money (i.e., solution could be deployed for aid relief in a sanctioned
         country).
         [0035] Embodiments may use a traditional payments infrastructure, but do not
require payment to flow over the network. Rather, the payments infrastructure tracks and
collects data.
         [0036] As this is not a monetary transaction, it allows for a broader list of
participants on the merchant and consumer side.
         [0037] Such an embodiment allows for a single implementation on which multiple
players can engage.
         [0038] Turning to FIGS. 3A-C, these figures depict an electronic voucher device,
constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.
         [0039] FIG. 3A shows an electronic voucher device displaying a menu selection
embodiment, allowing the selection of an electronic voucher or an alternate payment
method.
         [0040] FIG. 3B illustrates an electronic voucher device 100b displaying
pictograms or pictures as part of an authentication process embodiment. The electronic
voucher device 100b is encoded with the electronic voucher information, including the
number of unredeemed vouchers and authentication information. The authentication

                                               7
information may be a biometric component, such as an electronic image of the aid
recipient. The electronic image of the aid recipient may be a Graphics Interchange Format
(GIF), Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), or other image format known in the art.
During authentication of the electronic voucher device 100b, aid recipients may asked to
type in a Visual personal identification image (VPII), an authentication using pictograph
or image selection or sequence. The VPII is selected by the aid recipient in advance of the
voucher transaction. During authentication, the aid recipient selects the images that
constitute the VPII. In some embodiments, the VPII may require images to be selected
sequentially; in other embodiments, the selection of images need not be sequential, but all
the images of the VPII must be identified. The images or pictographs used may vary from
one disaster-relief area to another.
         [0041] Once the aid recipient is authenticated, the NGO mobile POS device 1112
verifies that there are an adequate number of unredeemed vouchers, and then decrements
the number of unredeemed voucher by the amount corresponding to the goods or services
received by the aid recipient.
         [0042] FIG. 3C is a block diagram of the electronic voucher device 100b
embodiment. When used in conjunction with a NGO mobile POS device 1112, electronic
voucher device 100b may be used to assist in enabling electronic voucher redemption. In
this example, electronic voucher device 100b is a mobile phone. Electronic voucher device
100b may be a mobile phone, tablet computer, personal digital assistant (PDA) or other
portable computing device known in the art capable of communicating electronic voucher
information to the NGO mobile POS device 1112.

         [0048] Visual authentication engine 3114 is configured to authenticate the aid
recipient using non-written communication of a Visual personal identification image, and
may do so in conjunction with image rendering engine 3118. Image rendering engine 3118
is configured to render images stored in an image database 3220. These stored images may
include pictures or pictograms used for a Visual personal identification image, and may
include a picture of the aid recipient.

NGO network 1100 may authorize electronic voucher and communicate restricted cash
transactions, and may do so in conjunction with payment network 6000; in such
embodiments, NGO network 1100 is configured to process financial transactions that
traverse an NGO network with a payment network 6000.
         [0076] NGO network 1100 may run a multi-tasking operating system (OS) and
include at least one processor or central processing unit (CPU) 5100, a non-transitory
computer-readable storage medium 5200, and a network interface 5300.
         [0077] Processor 5100 may be any central processing unit, microprocessor, micro
controller, computational device or circuit known in the art. It is understood that processor
5100 may communicate with and temporarily store information in Random Access
Memory (RAM) (not shown).
         [0078] As shown in FIG. 5, processor 5100 is functionally comprised of a NGO
network processing engine 5150, NGO-payment network interface 5110, a payment
purchase engine 5130, a voucher transaction management system 5140, and a data

to establish the NGO program rules, such as identifying registered merchants and aid
recipients, and enable their participation through the provision or sanction of an appoint of
sale system and electronic voucher, respectively.
         [0085] In embodiments where NGO network 1100 is in direct communication with
merchant 1110, transaction monitoring system 5144 enables a NGO-point-of-sale device
(POS) to validate the authenticity of a voucher, grants aid recipients permission to use the
voucher, and verifies the appropriateness of the merchant/aid-recipient combination, In
some embodiments, the transaction monitoring system 5144 further enables an aid
recipient or merchant 1110 to determine the number of unredeemed electronic vouchers
and the available commodities for the aid recipient, and tracking of completed transactions
that use the electronic voucher.
         [0086] Reporting and investigation service 5146 is the electronic service that
allows transactions to be monitored and allows registered entities to audit, investigate,
analyze, and report transaction activity. In some embodiments this functionality includes
the program management capability to interface with payment-purchase engine 5130, to
compensate a merchant 1110 for goods and services rendered.
         [0087] Data processor 5120 enables processor 5100 to interface with storage
medium 5200, network interface 5300 or any other component not on the processor 5100.

network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or the Internet.
         [0091] In addition, as shown in FIG. 5, storage medium 5200 may also contain a
NGO voucher account database 5230, NGO merchant database 5210, and NGO payment
network interface rules 5210. A NGO voucher account database 5230 is configured to
store NGO payment accountholder information, such as NGO payment card and account
information, NGO transaction information related to NGO accountholder accounts, and
any other NGO payment accountholder-related information. NGO merchant database 5210
is configured to store NGO-approved merchant information, such as their account
information. As described above, NGO-payment network interface rules 5220 include a
set of rules and restrictions that govern the types of transactions that may occur between
payment network processing engine 5112 and NGO network processing engine 5150
("cross-network interface rules'"). For illustrative purposes only, example NGO-payment
network interface rules 5220 may include limitations on the types of merchants that an
NGO-aid-recipient may pay outside the NGO network 1100; for example, the NGO-aid
recipient may be restricted to purchases of food or temporary shelter. Another example
limitation may include the amount of cash that an NGO-aid-recipient may withdraw from
an ATM 2120 outside the NGO network 1100.
         [0092] These structures may be implemented as hardware, firmware, or software
encoded on a non-transitory computer readable medium, such as storage media. Further
details of these components are described with their relation to method embodiments
below.

1120/2120 or merchant 1110/2110. The customer accounts may include payment card
accounts, checking accounts, savings accounts and the like.
         [00102]        Transaction management system 6140 is configured to manage the
NGO transactions on an NGO network 1100. In some embodiments, transaction
management system 6140 further comprises: registration interface 6142, transaction
monitoring system 6144, and reporting and investigation service 6146.
         [00103]        Registration interface 6142 is a structure that allows the program

sale device (POS) to validate the authenticity of a voucher, grants aid recipients
permission to use the voucher, and verifies the appropriateness of the merchant/aid
recipient combination, In some embodiments, the transaction monitoring system 6144
further enables an aid recipient or merchant 1110 to determine the balance on the voucher
and the available commodities for the aid recipient, and tracking of completed transactions
that use the voucher.
         [00105]        Reporting and investigation service 6146 is the electronic service
that allows transactions to be monitored and allows registered entities to audit, investigate,

         [00111]         These structures may be implemented as hardware, firmware, or
software encoded on a non-transitory computer readable medium, such as storage media.
Further details of these components are described with their relation to method
embodiments below.
         [00112]        An electronic restricted cash vouchers embodiment leverages a
payment network 6000 where the infrastructure is used for tracking and reporting rather
than payment. In both cash and commodity voucher situations, the fiduciary transactions
are separate from the tracking.
         [001131         Cash-out is a two-step process versus a single step process: the
consumer never "owns" the money they are withdrawing and the NGO is not reliant on the
payments network to deliver payment settlement. This is a separate function in the system,
versus an interwoven function.
         [00114]         Embodiments put technology and business practices at the center of
a laddering system of vouchers within domestic and international payment networks. A
single technology platform allows consumers to ladder from voucher to cash-out to
participation in a domestic network and upwards through participation in an international
network. In one embodiment, a platform and centralized infrastructure allows everything
from restricted commodities to cash to full payment enablement to connectivity between
points of acceptance and Cash-In/Cash-Out (CICO), a service provided by an affiliate of
the network where a consumer can either deposit or withdraw cash to/from their account.
         [00115]         The embodiments enable implementation of an electronic voucher
system on electronic voucher cards 100a, without the pre-emptive engagement of a
financial institution. This leads to more flexible initiation by constructing business rules
and implementing technologies that enable the electronic vouchers, but protect the
payment system 1000.
         [001161        As embodiments offer tracking services, not payment services, non
financial institutions can leverage the network to issue tokens and serve as providers of
these services. It is understood that non-financial institutions may have unique and
differentiated franchise rules, legal structures, and pricing models. Embodiments enable an
electronic voucher token to transition to a payment account system owned by a financial
institution without necessarily requiring the reissuance of cards.

                                               19
         [001171        An embodiment system fosters the collection and management of
data on consumer and merchant behavior. Observed behaviors (i.e., usage history,
spending habits) can be leveraged to transition clients to a formal relationship with a
financial institution, quickening and easing the process of financial inclusion. A tracking
system creates record of payment flows, consumer spending habits, and additional
information that a merchant can leverage with wholesalers, financial institutions and
suppliers.
         [00118]         The NGO may package and sell the collected know-your-customer
(KYC)/behavioral data to a financial institution and use the revenue to offset program
costs. If an NGO sells the portfolio to the financial institution, the financial institution can
enable payment functionality on the form factor concurrent with voucher programs.
         [00119]        Using an embodiment system, the NGO creates valuable assets for
both consumers and merchants through the tracking of usage history and spending habits.
Behavioral spend information allows financial institutions to cross sell products and offer
more sophisticated, targeted financial services (i.e., insurance, credit extension) beyond a
traditional payment card.
         [00120]        An embodiment, including the creation of necessary know-your
customer (KYC) resources, enables a NGO voucher system merchant point-of-sale (POS)
devices 1112 to be transitioned to an open network merchant acceptance device and
account owned by a financial institution without necessarily requiring the reissuance of the
POS device.
         [00121]         The NGO mobile POS device 1112 used by a merchant 1110 for
voucher acceptance is "locked" to the electronic voucher system until the merchant is
sanctioned to operate on the private or broader domestic and international payments
networks. Sophisticated capabilities are loaded, but are not available at the outset until
program managers "unlock" capabilities over time for additional enablement. This process
does not require the merchant to receive new hardware.
         [00122]        All changes in the status of the card or mobile point of sale (MPOS)
device is collected, consolidated and shared with the central database and other
participating stakeholders.
         [001231         Embodiments may include an electronic consumer-merchant
voucher system that meets necessary control requirements using photographic
authentication. The standards (branding, rules, and the like) for a payment network card
versus a voucher card may be different. Two and three factor photo validation may be

                                               20
enabled: photo is printed on the card, photo is stored on a chip that is read by the NG
mobile POS device 1112, and individual is present for comparison with photo.
Consequently, the individual/beneficiary/recipient is not required to remember a PIN or a
code. This is especially helpful when deployed in an environment where illiteracy is high.
         [00124]        In some embodiments, visual personal identification image
authentication may be used. The use of visual personal identification image authentication
recognizes that low levels of literacy and pin functionality occur throughout the world.
Such an embodiment allows a recipient to use images in place of numbers for a VPII.
Visual personal identification image entry can be mandated as a particular length and
order, or a sequence of images in a non-specific order. For example, the images (or icons)
may be provided to a user, and the user will have to select specific images as a VPII.
         [00125]        An electronic voucher system embodiment allows multiple NGO
programs to exist on a single token; streamlining the registration process, unconflicting the
assignment of benefits, and managing risk. All NGOs that have services on the card will
be notified of fraudulent activities/loss of card and can shut off functionality as needed.
The shared infrastructure provides support and opportunities for merchants 1110 who
concurrently provide commodities to multiple NGOs. A centralized database and shared
infrastructure allow information to be collected and easily accessed within a single
platform infrastructure.
         [00126]        Because NGOs have relationship with a centralized database, the
tools and MPOS can be shared and tracked in a uniform fashion. A consumer can use one
card for multiple NGOs, and a merchant can use one MPOS for multiple NGO programs.
         [001271        To enable the embodiments described, it is understood that
hardware, software, and firmware encoded on to non-transitory computer readable media
are utilized.
         [00128]        The previous description of the embodiments is provided to enable
any person skilled in the art to practice the disclosure. The various modifications to these
embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles
defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without the use of inventive faculty.
Thus, the present disclosure is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown
herein, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features
disclosed herein.
