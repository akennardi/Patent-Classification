                                                     3

[0012]          These and other aspects, objects, and features of the present invention will be
       understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art upon studying the following
       specification, claims, and appended drawings.

                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0034]         For purposes of description herein, the terms "upper," "lower," "right," "left,"
       "rear," "front," "vertical," "horizontal," and derivatives thereof shall relate to the
       invention as oriented in Fig. 2. However, it is to be understood that the invention may
       assume various alternative orientations and step sequences, except where expressly
       specified to the contrary.     It is also to be understood that the specific devices and
       processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and described in the following
       specification are exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the
       appended claims. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating
       to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting, unless the
       claims expressly state otherwise.
[0035]         A standard fifth wheel hitch assembly 10 is generally illustrated in FIG. 1. The fifth
       wheel hitch assembly 10 is mounted to vehicle frame rails 12 of an associated vehicle,
       such as a tractor trailer, or trailer assembly, where each vehicle frame rail 12 has a C
                                                     5

       shaped cross-sectional configuration including an upper horizontal top portion 13, a
       lower horizontal bottom portion 15, and            a vertical side portion     17 extending
       therebetween. In the illustrated example, the fifth wheel hitch assembly 10 includes a
       hitch plate 14 typically supported above a vehicle frame rail 12 by a pair of mounting
       brackets 16, a pair of angle members 18 welded to an associated vehicle frame rail 12,
       and an intermediate mounting member 20 positioned between the mounting brackets 16
       and the angle members 18.
[0036]         As best illustrated in Fig. 2, the present inventive fifth wheel hitch assembly 30
       includes mounting brackets 32 adapted to support a hitch plate 33. The fifth wheel hitch
       assembly 30 also includes support brackets 34 to releasably secure the mounting
       brackets 32 to the associated vehicle frame rails 12. Specifically, each support bracket 34
       includes a lower portion 36 removably or releasably secured to the vertical portion 17 of
       the associated vehicle frame rail 12, and an upper portion 38 removably or releasably
       secured to an associated mounting bracket 32.
[0037]         In the illustrated embodiment of Fig. 2, the vertical portion 17 of the frame rail 12
       includes a plurality of longitudinally spaced apertures 35a, while the lower portion 36 of
       the mounting bracket 34 includes a plurality of longitudinally spaced apertures 35b,
       wherein each aperture 35b of the lower portion 36 is aligned with an aperture 35a of the
       vertical portion 17. As shown, the apertures 35a of the vertical portion 17 are more
       tightly spaced than the lower portion 36. As a result, the apertures 35b of the lower
       portion 36 can make different alignments with the apertures 35a of the vertical portion
       17, thereby allowing more finite positioning of the support bracket 34 with respect to the
       frame rail 12, as well as allowing variously configured support brackets to be utilized. To
       secure the lower portion 36 of the support bracket 34 to the vertical portion 17 of the
       vehicle frame rail 12, mechanical fasteners (such as bolts 39) are inserted through the
       aligned apertures of the lower portion 36 and the vertical portion 17.
[0038]         The upper portion 38 of each support bracket 34 further includes a plurality of
       longitudinally-spaced apertures 50 that receive mechanical fasteners such as bolts 52
       therein that are received within corresponding longitudinally-spaced apertures (not
       shown) of the corresponding mounting bracket 32, thereby securing the mounting
                                                     6

       bracket 32 to the support bracket 34. Alternatively, the upper portion 38 may be fixedly
       secured to the associated mounting bracket 32, such as by welding.
[0039]          As best illustrated in Fig. 3, the lower portion 36 and the upper portion 38 of the
       support bracket 34 are horizontally offset from one another via an intermediate bend 54,
       thereby allowing the support brackets 34 to be utilized within various fifth wheel systems
       requiring different widths between the pairings of support brackets 34 by changing the
       inner and outer orientation of the support brackets 36 with respect to the associated
       frame rails 12.
[0040]          It should be appreciated that the use of the present inventive mounting bracket
       eliminates the necessity of additional mounting components, which may result in a
       material size and weight reduction of the fifth wheel hitch assembly. Fifth wheel hitch
       assemblies requiring various spacing between the associated support brackets are
       accommodated in the present design by configuring the mounting bracket such that the
       upper portion is positioned outwardly or inwardly from the lower portion. However, it is
       noted that planar configurations may also be employed via shims (not shown) located
       between the upper portion 38 of the mounting bracket 34 and the associated mounting
       bracket 32 in order to accommodate for fifth wheel hitch assemblies requiring variously
       spaced support brackets.
[0041]          The reference numeral 30a (Fig. 4) generally designates another embodiment of
       the fifth wheel hitch assembly. Since the hitch assembly 30a is similar to the previously
       described hitch assembly 30, similar parts appearing in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4, respectively are
       represented by the same, corresponding reference numeral, except for the suffix "a" in
       the numerals of the latter. In the illustrated example, the upper portion 38a of the each
       support bracket 34a includes additional apertures or mounting locations 50a than
       required for releasable mounting the associated mounting bracket 32a to the support
       bracket 34a.     As a result, the mounting brackets 32a may be selectively mounted at
       different positions along the length of the support brackets 34a. Alternatively, additional
       components and assembly may be releasably mounted to the additional apertures or
       mounting locations 50a not occupied by the mounting brackets 32a.              For example,
       additional assemblies such as a tilt lock-out arrangement 60 adapted to engage the fifth
                                                       7

       wheel hitch plate 33a and prevent the fifth wheel hitch plate 33a from tilting with
       respect to the frame rails 12a in a manner known in the art, and a tilt-stop arrangement
       62 adapted to abut the fifth wheel hitch plate 33a and limit the amount of tilt of the fifth
       wheel hitch plate 33a, may be releasably secured to the support bracket 34a at various
       mounting locations 50a.
[0042]         The reference numeral 30b (Fig. 5) generally designates another embodiment of
       the present invention.      Since the fifth wheel hitch assembly 30b is similar to the
       previously described fifth wheel hitch assembly 30, similar parts appearing in Fig. 2 and
       Fig. 5, respectively are represented by the same, corresponding reference numeral,
       except for the suffix "b" in the numeral of the latter. In the illustrated example, the
       support bracket 34b (Fig. 6) is corrugated along the length thereof, thereby increasing
       the relative structural integrity of the same.      As illustrated, the support bracket 34b
       includes first sections 70 that abut the vertical portion 17b of the frame rail 12b and the
       vertical surfaces of the mounting bracket 32b, interspaced with second sections 72 that
       are spaced from the frame rail 12b and mounting bracket 32b.
[0043]         The fifth wheel hitch assembly 30b further includes a dog-bone shaped structural
       cross member 80 that includes a bottom wall 82 and an upwardly-extending side wall 84
       surrounding a narrowed central portion 86 and flared end portions 88.             The cross
       member 80 is releasably secured to inwardly-facing surfaces of the mounting brackets
       32b by the bolts 52b that secure the mounting brackets 32b to the support brackets 34b.
[0044]         As best illustrated in Fig. 7, the various embodiments of the support brackets 34
       as described herein may be configured such that the mounting brackets 32 and/or the
       cross member 80 is spaced from the upper horizontal portions 13 of the frame member
       12, thereby defining a gap 90 therebetween.
[0045]         Referring now to Figs. 8-11, the reference numeral 1010 generally designates a
       fifth wheel hitch assembly that includes a support bracket 1012 adapted to operably
       couple with a tractor or vehicle frame 1014. The hitch assembly 1010 also includes a
       hitch plate 1016 that is coupled to the support bracket 1012 for pivoting between a first
       position and a second position.       The hitch plate 1016 has a throat 1018 adapted to
       receive a kingpin 1020 of a trailer 1022. The hitch plate 1016 also has an intermediate
                                                       8

       portion 1024 pivotably coupled with the support bracket 1012 and has a rearwardly
       extending rear portion 1026 having a first section 1028 and a second section 1030
       juxtapositioned across the throat 1018 from one another. The hitch assembly 1010 also
       includes a stabilizer assembly 1032 that is operable between an unlocked position 1034
       and a locked position 1036. In the unlocked position 1034 the stabilizer assembly 1032 is
       coupled with a select one of the support bracket 1012 or the rear portion 1026 of the
       hitch plate 1016, such that the hitch plate 1016 may pivot between the first and second
       positions. In the locked position 1036 the stabilizer assembly 1032 is coupled with the
       support bracket 1012 and the rear portion 1026 of the hitch plate 1016, thereby
       restricting movement of the hitch plate 1016 between the first and second positions and
       supporting the first and second sections 1026, 1028 of the rear portion 1026 of the hitch
       plate 1016. In the illustrated example, a controller 1038 operates the stabilizer assembly
       1032 between the unlocked and locked positions 1034, 1036 from a location 1040
       remote from the stabilizer assembly 1032.
[0046]          Referring now to Fig. 8, the vehicle frame 1014 extends along a bottom portion
       1042 of a tractor or vehicle 1044. The vehicle frame 1014 is supported by two front
       wheels 1046 at a front end 1048 of the vehicle 1044 and by eight rear wheels 1050 at a
       rear end 1052 of the vehicle 1044. The front end 1048 of the vehicle 1044 has a cab
       1054, an engine 1056, and fuel tanks 1058 that are supported by the vehicle frame 1014.
       At the rear end 1052 of the vehicle 1044, the vehicle frame or frame member 1014
       supports the fifth wheel hitch assembly 1010 generally between the rear wheels 1050. It
       is contemplated, however, that fewer wheels may be included at the rear end 1052 of
       the vehicle 1044.
[0047]          As illustrated in Fig. 9, the fifth wheel hitch assembly 1010 is coupled with the
       vehicle frame 1014 generally between a forward set 1060 and a rearward set 1062 of the
       rear wheels 1050. The vehicle frame 1014 includes two parallel beams 1064 extending
       from the rear end 1052 (Fig. 8) to the front end 1048 of the vehicle 1044 (Fig. 8). The
       beams 1064 are positioned inside the rear wheels 1050, such that two wheels are
       laterally located outside the beams 1064 on both sides of the vehicle frame 1014 for the
       forward and rearward sets 1060, 1062 of the rear wheel 1050. The fifth wheel hitch
                                                      9

       assembly 1010 is coupled with a top surface 1066 of the beams 1064 of the vehicle frame
       1014 and generally centered laterally between the beams 1064. More specifically, the
       support bracket 1012 of the fifth wheel hitch assembly 1010 is coupled with the top
       surface 1066 of the beams 1064 of the vehicle frame 1014. The hitch plate 1016 is
       pivotably coupled with the support bracket 1012, aligning the first and the second
       section 1028, 1030 to face rearward, substantially positioning the throat 1018 of the
       hitch plate 1016 in the center of and in parallel alignment with the beams 1064 of the
       vehicle frame 1014. It is contemplated that the fifth wheel hitch assembly 1010 may be
       disposed at other locations along the rear end 1052 of the vehicle frame 1014.
[0048]         Referring now to Fig. 10, the support bracket 1012 is operably coupled with the
       top surface 1066 of the beams 1064. The support bracket 1012 extends on the beams
       1064 from a front end 1068 that is substantially aligned with a forward end 1070 of the
       hitch plate 1016 to a rear end 1072 that extends beyond the rear portion 1026 of the
       hitch plate 1016. The rear end 1072 of the support bracket 1012 includes a support
       beam 1074 that extends laterally between a first side 1076 and a second side 1078 of the
       support bracket 1012, corresponding to the beams 1064.             Likewise, the stabilizer
       assembly 1032 couples with and extends between the first and second sides 1076, 1078
       of the support bracket 1012.
[0049]         One embodiment of the stabilizer assembly 1032, as illustrated in Figs. 10 and 11,
       includes a first hammer-shaped swing lock 1080 and a second hammer-shaped swing lock
       1082 that are pivotably coupled with the first and second sides 1076, 1078 of the support
       bracket 1012, respectively, below the first and second sections 1028, 1030 of the hitch
       plate 1016. A handle end 1084 of the first and second swing lock 1080, 1082 is pivotably
       coupled with the support bracket 1012 in substantially vertical alignment with and below
       an aperture 1086 formed in an outer side flange 1088 of the respective first and second
       section 1028, 1030. The outer side flange 1088 extends down substantially orthogonally
       from an outside edge 1090 of an upper surface 1092 of the first and second section 1028,
       1030. In Fig. 10, the apertures 1086 are not engaged by the stabilizer assembly 1032,
       and accordingly, the stabilizer assembly is in the unlocked position 1034, wherein the
       hitch plate 1016 may pivot about the support bracket 1012 between the first and second
                                                   10

       positions. However, as shown in Fig. 11, the first and second swing lock 1080, 1082 are
       engaged with the apertures 1086, placing the stabilizer assembly 1032 in the locked
       position 1036, such that the hitch plate 1016 is restricted from pivoting about the
       support bracket 1012 and the rear portion 1026 of the hitch plate 1016 is vertically
       supported at both the first and second section 1028, 1030.
[0050]          In the unlocked position 1034, as shown in Fig. 12 without the hitch plate 1016 for
       illustration purposes, the first and second swing locks 1080, 1082 extend laterally inward
       from the first and second sides 1076, 1078 of the support bracket 1012, respectively,
       whereby the handle ends 1084 of the swing locks are pivotably coupled to the sides
       about a pivot connection 1094. The first and second swing locks 1080, 1082 extend
       inwardly to a head end 1096 that includes a cylindrically shaped post 1098 extending
       orthogonally therefrom.     Further, in the unlocked position 1034, the first and second
       swing locks 1080, 1082 extend at an angle down and outward from the pivot connection
       1094 to an actuator end 1100. A pneumatic cylinder 1102 extends between the actuator
       ends 1100 of the handle ends 1084 of each of the first and second swing locks 1080,
       1082. The pneumatic cylinder 1102 is operable between an expanded condition 1104
       (Fig. 12) and a contracted condition 1106 (Fig. 13) that operates the stabilizer assembly
       1032 between the unlocked position 1034 and the locked position 1036, respectively. In
       the locked position 1036, the cylindrically shaped posts 1098 engage the apertures 1086,
       detachably coupling head ends 1096 of the first and second swing locks 1080, 1082 with
       the first and second sections 1028, 1030 of the hitch plate 1016.
[0051]          As illustrated in Figs. 12 and 13, the pneumatic cylinder 1102 includes an
       extension rod 1108 and a cylinder housing 1110, wherein the extension rod 1108 slidably
       moves within the cylinder housing 1110 upon operation of the pneumatic cylinder 1102
       between the expanded and contracted positions 1104, 1106. The pneumatic cylinder
       1102 is pivotably coupled between the actuator ends 1100, at an angled location below
       the pivot connections 1094 of the swing locks 1080, 1082 with the support bracket 1012.
       As such, the swing locks 1080, 1082 are permitted to swing from the generally horizontal
       position, when the pneumatic cylinder 1102 is in the extended condition 1104, to a
       substantially vertical position, when the pneumatic cylinder 1102 is in the contracted
                                                    11

       condition 1106, allowing the stabilizer assembly 1032 to engage in the locked position
       1036. The pneumatic cylinder 1102 is operated by the controller 1038 that is placed at
       the location 1040 (Fig. 8), remote from the stabilizer assembly 1032, located in the cab
       1054 (Fig. 8) of the vehicle 1044 to operate the stabilizer assembly 1032 between the
       unlocked position 1034 and the lock position 1036 without a user having to exit the cab
       1054 of the vehicle 1044. However, it is contemplated that the controller 1038 may be
       placed at an alternative location, such as on or near the fifth wheel hitch assembly 1010.
       The pneumatic cylinder 1102 is of a type generally known and understood by those
       skilled in the art, such that the connection and internal operation of the pneumatic
       cylinder is not described herein.
[0052]          As further illustrated in Figs. 14 and 15, in the unlocked position 1034, as shown
       in Fig. 14, the first and second swing locks 1080, 1082 are substantially horizontal and in
       linear alignment with each other and the pneumatic cylinder 1102 extending there
       between. In such unlocked position 1034, the cylindrical posts 1098 extend vertically and
       substantially orthogonal to the pneumatic cylinder 1102. Further, the extension rod 1108
       of the pneumatic cylinder 1102 is extending from the cylinder housing 1110 of the
       pneumatic cylinder 1102 to position the actuator end 1100 of the first and second swing
       locks 1080, 1082 laterally outward from the pivot connection 1094 of the swing locks
       with the support bracket 1012.
[0053]          As shown in Fig. 15 the extension rod 1108 of the pneumatic cylinder 1102 has
       extended into the cylinder housing 1110, as the pneumatic cylinder 1102 is in the
       contracted condition 1106. In the contracted condition 1106, the actuator ends 1100 of
       the first and second swing locks 1080, 1082, have pivoted about the pivot connections
       1094 laterally inward from the first and second sides 1076, 1078 of the support bracket
       1012. In the contracted condition 1106 of the pneumatic cylinder 1102, the swing locks
       1080, 1082 are substantially vertical, such that the cylindrical posts 1098 on the head
       ends 1096 are substantially horizontal and in coaxial alignment with the apertures 1086
       formed in the first and second section 1028, 1030 of the hitch plate 1016 (Fig. 11).
       Accordingly, the first and second swing locks 1080, 1082 pivot ninety degrees between
       the expanded and contracted conditions 1104, 1106 of the pneumatic cylinder 1102. The
                                                      12

       engagement of the cylindrical posts 1098 on the first and second swing locks 61080, 1082
       with the apertures 1086 place the stabilizer assembly 1032 in the locked position 1036. It
       is also contemplated that the first and second swing locks 1080, 1082 are pivotably
       coupled in an alternative arrangement with the support bracket 1012 or the vehicle
       frame 1014 such that the first and second swing locks 1080, 1082 couple with the first
       and second section 1028, 1030, respectively, of the hitch plate 1016 (Fig. 11).
[0054]          Referring now to Figs. 16 and 17, a track assembly 1112 is adapted to be coupled
       between the support bracket 1012 of the fifth wheel hitch assembly 1010 and the vehicle
       frame 1014 (not shown), allowing the hitch plate 1016 to be slidably positioned at
       various horizontal fore-aft positions relative to the rear end 1052 the vehicle frame 1014
       (Fig. 8). The track assembly 1112 includes a rail 1114 that is coupled with the vehicle
       frame 1014 and slidably engaged with a carriage 1116 supporting the support bracket
       1012. It is contemplated that the support bracket 1012 may be operably coupled with the
       beams 1064 of the vehicle frame 1014 (Fig. 9), without the track assembly, as illustrated
       in Figs. 10-15. However, it is also contemplated that the stabilizer assembly 1032
       embodiment illustrated in Figs. 10-15, may be adapted to include a track assembly.
[0055]          As further illustrated in Figs. 16 and 17, an alternative embodiment of the
       stabilizer assembly 1032 is shown, including a first pin 1118 and second pin 1120 slidably
       coupled below the first and second section 1028, 1030 of the hitch plate 1016,
       respectively. A threaded rod 1122 is threadably engaged with and extends between the
       first and second pins 1118, 1120, such that axle rotation of the threaded rod 1122
       translates the pins 1118, 1120 between the unlocked position 1124 (Fig. 16) and the
       locked position 1126 (Fig. 17). The threaded rod 1122 is coaxially disposed within a
       cylindrical cavity 1127 in the first and second pins and threadably engaged therein.
[0056]          As shown in Figs. 18 and 19, the fifth wheel hitch assembly 1010 is shown without
       the hitch plate 1016 for illustration purposes. A rotation motor 1128 is centrally
       positioned between the first and second pins 1118, 1120 and thereby substantially
       aligned below the throat of the hitch plate (Fig. 17). The rotation motor 1128 is geared to
       engage the threaded rod 1122 about a geared portion (not shown) thereof, such that
       axial rotation of the threaded rod 1122 by the rotation motor 1128 causes, otherwise
                                                      13

       stationary, axial rotation of the threaded rod 1122. Such rotation, in turn, causes lateral
       translation of the first and second pins 1118, 1120 within a respective first tubular
       housing 1130 and second tubular housing 1132. The first and second tubular housings
       1130, 1132 have a connection bracket 1134 extending vertically therefrom allowing the
       connection bracket 1134 to attach with a bottom portion of the respective first and
       second section 1028, 1030 of the hitch plate 1016 (Fig. 17). Upon pivotable alignment of
       the hitch plate 1016, about the support bracket 1012, the first and second tubular
       housings 1130, 1132 laterally and coaxially align with a respective first engagement port
       1136 and second engagement port 1138 disposed on the support bracket 1012. The first
       and second engagement ports 1136, 1138 have a cylindrical hole 1140 formed therein
       that coaxially aligns and is adapted to receive the respective first and second pins 1118,
       1120. As shown in Fig. 19, the first pin 1118 is engaged with the hole 1140 in the first
       engagement port 1136, first with a portion of the first pin 1118 remaining within the first
       tubular housing 1130 transitioning the stabilizer assembly 1032 to the locked position
       1126, wherein shear stress is applied to the first pin 1118 when the hitch plate 1016 is
       restricted from pivoting about the support bracket 1012. In the locked position 1126, the
       hitch plate 1016 (not shown) is restricted from pivoting about the support bracket 1012
       by both the first and second pins 1118, 1120, stabilizing the rear portion 1026 of the
       hitch plate 1016 at the first and second section 1028, 1030.
[0057]         As shown in Figs. 20 and 21, the threaded rod 1122 extends within the tubular
       housing 1130, 1132 to an outside edge 1142 thereof, and accordingly, the threaded rod
       1122 and the first and second pins 1118, 1120 (not shown) threadably engaged therewith
       pivot with the hitch plate 1016 (not shown) when the stabilizer assembly 1032 is in the
       unlocked position 1124. The first and second pins 1118, 1120 are substantially tubular
       shaped and include a threaded inside surface 1144 to engage the threaded rod 1122 and
       a substantially smooth exterior surface 1146 to slidably engage the respective
       engagement port 1136, 1138 in the locked position 1126. The threaded rod 1122
       includes a square shaped indentation 1146 on the end surface thereof. The indentation
       1146 is formed to receive a tool that may be inserted through the cylindrical hole 1140 in
       the engagement port 1136, 1138 and engage the threaded rod 1122 to axially rotate the
                                                    14

       threaded rod 1122 and thereby adjust the lateral position of the first and second pin
       1118, 1120 with respect to the first and second engagement ports 1136, 1138. It is
       contemplated that the rotation motor 1128 may not be included or may incur periods of
       non-functionality, wherein the utilization of the indentation and a tool to axially rotate
       the threaded rod 1122 may be necessary. It is further contemplated that the first and
       second pin 1118, 1120 may have an alternative locked position 1126 from that illustrated
       in Figs. 17, 19, and 21.
[0058]          As generally illustrated in Figs. 8-21 the method for stabilizing the hitch plate
       1016 of the fifth wheel hitch assembly 1010 includes providing the vehicle frame
       member 1014; the support bracket 1012 operably coupled with the frame member 1014;
       and the hitch plate 1016 pivotably coupled to the support bracket 1012 for pivotable
       movement between the first position and the second position, and having the rearwardly
       extending first section 1028 and the rearwardly extending second section 1030. The
       stabilizer assembly 1032 is operable between an unlocked position 1034, wherein the
       hitch plate 1016 may pivot between the first and second positions, and a locked position
       1036, wherein the first and second sections 1028, 1030 are detachably coupled with the
       support bracket 1012, thereby restricting movement of the hitch plate 1016 between the
       first and second positions. The hitch plate 1016 is pivoted about the support bracket
       1012 to position the first and second sections 1028, 1030 in alignment with the support
       bracket 1012 to allow for the stabilizer assembly 1032 to transition from the unlocked
       position 1034 to the locked position 1036. The first and second sections 1028, 1030 of
       the hitch plate 1016 are coupled with the support bracket 1012 to restrict the pivotable
       movement of the hitch plate 1016 between the first and second positions and stabilize
       the first and section sections 1028, 1030 of the hitch plate 1016, thereby engaging the
       stabilizer assembly 1032 in the locked position 1036.
[0059]          The present inventive fifth wheel hitch assembly provides a highly modular
       arrangement adaptable for use with vehicle frame assemblies of varying configurations.
       The hitch assembly further reduces initial installation as well as repair time and costs,
       increases overall structural rigidity, is adaptable for use in many global markets with
                                                     15

       various restriction and legal requirements, is economical to manufacture, and is
       particularly well adapted for the proposed use.
[0060]         It is to be understood that variations and modifications can be made on the
       aforementioned structure without departing from the concepts of the present invention,
       and further it is to be understood that such concepts are intended to be covered by the
       following claims unless these claims by their language expressly state otherwise.
