     of the device 100 operate.     The first screen 600 includes a first display area 602 which
     displays a title bar expressing a name of an application, such as, for example, a photo

                                              16
     album application, executed in the device 100, and at least one image 603 (e.g., images
     101 through 112) stored in a storing unit of the device 100 or a folder including the at
     least one image 603, according to the photo-album application.        The first screen 600 is
     one of a plurality of screens which display the at least one image 603 provided by the
     photo-album application or the folder.     According to the number of folders or the
     images 603 displayed on the first display area 602, the number of screens provided by
     the photo-album application may be changed.        According to an Operating System (OS)
     or an application of the device 100, the title bar may not be displayed on the first screen
     600.    When the title bar is not displayed, as in FIG. 6B, the first screen 600 means the
     first display area 602.   According to an OS or an application of the device 100, the
     status bar 601 may not be displayed on the first touch screen 190a.       When the status
     bar 601 is not displayed, the first touch screen 190a may display only the first screen
     600.     The application of the device 100 may include, for example, a messenger
     program, a word processor, a spread program, a presentation program, a web browser,
     or a Social Networking Service (SNS) program.        The application of the device 100
     may include an application and a widget, which are downloaded in the on-line market or
     provided by a manufacturer.      When a friend list or a time line provided by the
     messenger program is longer than the widthwise length or lengthwise length of the first
     touch screen 190a and the second touch screen 190b, it may be provided on a plurality
     of screens.    When a page provided by the word processor, the spreadsheet program,
     and the presentation program is longer than the widthwise length or lengthwise length
     of the first touch screen 190a and the second touch screen 190b, it may be provided on a
     plurality of screens.   When a web page currently displayed on the web browser is
     longer than the widthwise length or lengthwise length of the first touch screen 190a and
     the second touch screen 190b, the single web page may be divided to fit the length of
     the first touch screen 190a and the second touch screen 190b and provided on a plurality
     of screens.    When the time line in the SNS program is longer than the widthwise length
     or lengthwise length of the first touch screen 190a and the second touch screen 190b, it
     may be provided on a plurality of screens.     Applications providing the plurality of
     screens are not limited and may be changed.       Examples of applications providing the
     plurality of screens may be easily understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.
[95]     In step S502 of FIG. 5, a second screen continuing from the first screen is displayed

                                              17
     on a second touch screen.
[96]     Referring to FIG. 6B, a second screen 610 and a status bar 611 indicating the status
     of the device 100 are displayed on the second touch screen 190b.        The second screen
     610 may include a second display area 612 which displays a title bar expressing a name
     of the same photo-album application as used to display the first screen 600 on the first
     touch screen 190a and at least one image 613 (e.g., images 113 through 124) stored in
     the storing unit of the application 100 or a folder including the at least one image 613,
     according to the same photo-album application.
[97]     The second screen 610 is one of a plurality of screens that display the at least one
     image 613 or the folder for providing the same photo-album application as the
     application displayed on the first screen 600.    According to a determined order, the
     second screen 610 is a screen continuing from the first screen 600 in an ascending
     sequence.    For example, according to a first order, a next screen with respect to the
     first screen 600, includes an image 113 next to an image 112 displayed last on the first
     screen 600.    The second screen may also be a screen continuing from the first screen
     600 in a descending sequence.      For example,, according to a second order, a previous
     screen with respect to the first screen 600, includes an image 100 previous to an image
     101 displayed first on the first screen 600.
[98]     The number of folders or images 613 displayed on the second display area 612 is
     dependent on the first display area 602.    For example, when only the image 101 is
     displayed on the first display area 602, the image 102 of the first display area 602
     according to the first order or the image 100 of the first display area 602 according to
     the second order, is displayed on the second display area 612.      In an embodiment of
     the present invention, 12 images, images 101 through 112, are displayed on the first
     display area 602, and 12 images, images 113 through 124, continuing from the image
     112 displayed last on the first display area 602 according to the first order, are displayed
     on the second display area 612.
[99]    According to an OS or an application of the device 100, the title bar may not be
     displayed on the second screen 610.      When the title bar is not displayed, the second
     screen 610 means the second display area 612.       According to an OS or an application
     of the device 100, the status bar 611 may not be displayed on the second touch screen
     190b.     When the status bar 611 is not displayed, only the second screen 610 may be

                                               18
      displayed on the second touch screen 190b.
[100]     In step S503 of FIG. 5, it is determined whether a touch is detected on the first touch
      screen.
[101]     Referring to FIG. 6B, a user generates a touch 640 on the first touch screen 190a.
      The controllers 110 and 11 0a may detect the touch 640 by using the first touch screen
      190a and the touch screen controllers 195 and 195a. The controllers 110 and 110a
      may receive the first position 640a (e.g., X and Y coordinates) on the first screen 600
      corresponding to the touch 640 from the touch screen controllers 195 and 195a. The
      controllers 110 and 110a may store a touch position on the first touch screen 190a and a
      touch time at which the touch 640 is detected on the first touch screen 190a in the
      storing unit.    The touch 640 contacting the first touch screen 190a may be generated by,
      for example, one of fingers or a touch of a touchable object.
[102]     In another embodiment of the present invention, the number of touches detected on
      the first touch screen 190a is not limited to one, and a plurality of touches may be
      detected.    When the plurality of touches are detected on the first touch screen 190a, the
      controllers 110 and 11 Oa may store a plurality of touch positions and a plurality of touch
      times at which the plurality of touches are detected in the storing unit.   The number of
      detected touches can be easily understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.
[103]     When a touch is not detected on the first touch screen 190a in step S503, the
      methodology of FIG. 5 proceeds to step S507.
[104]     When a touch is detected on the first touch screen 190a in step S503, continuous
      movement of the touch is detected in step S504.
[105]     Referring to FIG. 6B, the controllers 110 and 1 Oa may detect continuous movement
      (e.g., a plurality of X and Y coordinates corresponding to a continuous touch) of the
      touch 640 among at least one touches contacting the first touch screen 190a by using the
      first touch screen 190a and the touch screen controllers 195 and 195a. The continuous
      movement of the touch may be stored in the storing unit of the device 100.      The touch
      contacting the first touch screen 190a may be a single touch or a plurality of touches.
[106]     Continuous movement of a touch (e.g., movement from 640a to 640b) means a part
      of a continuous touch gesture (e.g., movement from 640a to 640d) of the touch from the
      first touch screen 190a to the second touch screen 190b.     Continuous movement of a
      touch (e.g., movement from 640c to 640d) means a part of the continuous touch gesture

                                                 19
      (e.g., movement from 640a to 640d) of the touch from the first touch screen 190a to the
      second touch screen 190b.        Continuous movement of a touch also means that a contact
      is kept continuous on the first touch screen 190a and the second touch screen 190b,
      except for in the interval 100d between the first touch screen 190a and the second touch
      screen 190b.      The continuous movement of the touch has non-contact positions in the
      interval 100d and the last position 640d on the second touch screen 190b.
[107]     Referring to FIG. 6B, continuous movement of a touch from the first touch screen
      190a to the second touch screen 190b includes, for example, a drag and drop or a flick
      as touch gestures.
[108]     In step S505 of FIG. 5, arrival of the touch on the second touch screen is detected.
[109]     Referring to FIG. 6B, the touch starts from the first touch screen 190a, passes
      through the interval 100d between the first touch screen 190a and the second touch
      screen 190b, and arrives on the second touch screen 190b.        The controllers 110, 11 Oa,
      and 110b may recognize the last position 640b of the touch on the first touch screen
      190a and the first position 640c of the touch arriving on the second touch screen 190b
      by using the touch screen controllers 195, 195a, and 195b and the storing unit.
[110]     The controllers 110, 110a, and 1 Ob may detect arrival of the touch on the second
      touch screen 190b by using a time at which the touch passes through the interval 100d
      (e.g., a first time interval), an area determined on the second touch screen 190b, or a
      direction determined on the second touch screen 190b (e.g., an allowable inclination
      range).
[111]     FIGs. 7A through 7C are diagrams illustrating arrival of a continuous touch
      generated on a touch screen onto another touch screen, according to an embodiment of
      the present invention.
[112]     Referring to FIG. 7A, the controllers 110, 11Oa, and I1Ob may detect arrival of a
      touch on the second touch screen 190b by using a first time interval TI.       For example,
      the first time interval TI is an interval between a time tl at the last position 700a of the
      touch on the first touch screen 190a and a time t2 at the first position 700b of the touch
      on the second touch screen 190b and is less than 0.5 sec, where the time ti and the time
      t2 are stored in the storing unit.    According to an embodiment of the present invention,
      a touch has to arrive on the second touch screen 190b within the first time interval TI.
[113]     Referring to FIGs. 11 A and 1IB, the first time interval TI may be changed using a

                                               20
      Touch Time Interval item 1106a of a Touch Setting item 1106 (e.g., the first time
      interval TI may be changed to 0.3 sec).
[114]     Referring to FIG. 7B, the controllers 110, 11 Oa, and 1 Ob may detect arrival of a
      touch on the second touch screen 190b by using a determined area Al.         For example,
      the determined area Al may be a 1/2 area of a circle having a radius of 3 cm from a
      position 71 Ob on the second touch screen 190b extending from the last position 71 0a on
      the first touch screen 190a, where the positions 71 Ob and 71 0a being stored in the
      storing unit. The determined area Al is not limited to a circle and may be in a polygonal
      shape (e.g., an area within a square being 3 cm wide and 2 cm long upward and
      downward with respect to the first position 710b on the second touch screen 190b).
      According to an embodiment of the present invention, the touch has to arrive within the
      determined area Al on the second touch screen 190b.
[115]     Referring to FIGs. 11 A and 1 IB, the determined area Al may be changed using a
      Radius of Determined Region item 1106b of the Touch Setting item 1106 (e.g., the
      radius may be changed to 2 cm).
[116]     Referring to FIG. 7C, the controllers 110, 11 Oa, and 1 Ob may detect arrival of a
      touch on the second touch screen 190b by using an allowable inclination range RI (e.g.,
      second inclinations 02 and 03).    A first inclination 01 of the touch is an inclination of a
      straight line connecting from the first position 720a to the last position 720b on the first
      touch screen 190a, where the positions 720a and 720b are stored in the storing unit.
      When the first inclination 81 is 150, the first position 720c of the touch on the second
      touch screen 190b is in an area between the second inclinations 02 and 03 (e.g., 450).
      For the second inclinations 02 and 03 of 45', the allowable inclination range RI means
      an area between an extended line including a position on the second touch screen 190b
      corresponding to an inclination 02 of +45' with respect to the last position 720b of the
      first touch screen 190a, and an extended line including a position on the second touch
      screen 190b corresponding to an inclination 03 of -45' with respect to the last position
      720b of the first touch screen 190a.    According to an embodiment of the present
      invention, the touch has to arrive in an area within the allowable inclination range RI on
      the second touch screen 190b.
[117]     Referring to FIGs. 11 A and 1 IB, the allowable inclination range RI may be changed
      using an Allowable Inclination Range item 1 106c of the Touch Setting item 1106 (e.g.,

                                                21
      30' with respect to the second inclinations 02 and 03).
[118]     The controllers 110, 11 0a, and 11 Ob may provide a feedback responding to arrival
      640c of the touch on the second touch screen 190b to the user.       The provided feedback
      may be at least one of a visual feedback, an audible feedback, or a tactile feedback.
      For example, the controllers 110, 11 Oa, and 11 Ob may provide a combination of a visual
      feedback, an audible feedback, and a tactile feedback to the user.
[119]     The visual feedback may be displayed as a visual effect responding to arrival 640c of
      the touch on the second touch screen 190b (e.g., a separate image or an animation effect
      such as fade applied to a separate image), on either the first touch screen 190a or the
      second touch screen 190b or both.       The audible feedback may be output as a sound
      responding to arrival 640c of the touch on the second touch screen 190b, from either the
      first speaker 163 or the second speaker 163b or both.      The tactile feedback may be
      output as a vibration responding to arrival 640c of the touch on the second touch screen
      190b from the vibration motor 164.       At least one feedback may be maintained until
      arrival of the touch in the last position 640d on the second touch screen 190b.
[120]     Referring to FIGs. 11 A and 1 IB, by using a Feedback item 1 106e of the Touch
      Setting item 1106, a time (e.g., 0.5 sec) for which the at least one feedback is provided
      to the user may be changed.      In addition, a feedback provided to the user (e.g., at least
      one of a visual feedback, an audible feedback, and a tactile feedback) may be selected.
[121]     In step S506 of FIG. 5, the first screen and the second screen are changed into other
      screens among the plurality of screens corresponding to the first order.
[122]     Referring to FIG. 6C, the controllers 110, 1 10a, and 1 Ob change the first screen 600
      and the second screen 610 into other screens 615 and 620 among the plurality of screens
      corresponding to the first order in response to arrival 640c of the touch on the second
      touch screen 190b.     The other screens 615 and 620 display first 2 screens (e.g., images
      1 through 12 are displayed on the first touch screen 190a and images 13 through 24 are
      displayed on the second touch screen 190b) among the plurality of screens which
      correspond to the first order of the first screen 600 and the second screen 610 and
      continuous movement of a touch.        The changed other screens 615 and 620 maintain the
      same display format in which 12 images are displayed on each of the first screen 600
      and the second screen 610 as before change.
[123]     When arrival of the touch on the second touch screen 190b is detected, change of the

                                                22
      first screen 600 and the second screen 610 into the other screens 615 and 620 may start.
      When arrival of the touch on the second touch screen 190b is detected, change of the
      first screen 600 and the second screen 610 into the other screens 615 and 620 may start
      after a first delay (e.g., 0.2 sec). Change of the first screen 600 and the second screen
      610 into the other screens 615 and 620 may be completed before, upon, or after
      completion at the last position 640d of the continuous movement of the touch.
[124]     Referring to FIGs. 11 A and 1 IB, a screen change time corresponding to change of
      the first screen 600 and the second screen 610 into the other screens 615 and 620 may
      be changed using a Screen Change Time item 11 06f of the Touch Setting item 1106
      (e.g., the first delay of 0.1 sec).
[125]     When a first screen 625 and a second screen 630, which are the last 2 screens among
      the plurality of screens, are displayed on the first touch screen 190a and the second
      touch screen 190b, respectively, as shown in FIG. 6A, and the touch detected on the
      second touch screen 190b passes through the interval 100d and arrives on the first touch
      screen 190a; then the first screen 625 and the second screen 630 are not changed.
[126]     When the first screen 625 and the second screen 630, which are the last 2 screens
      among the plurality of screens, are displayed on the first touch screen 190a and the
      second touch screen 190b, respectively, as shown in FIG. 6A, and the touch detected on
      the first touch screen 190a passes through the interval 100d and arrives on another touch
      screen; then the first screen 625 on the first touch screen 190a and the second screen
      630 on the second touch screen 190b may be changed into other screens 615 and 620.
[127]     Similarly, when the first screen 615 and the second screen 620, which are the first 2
      screens among the plurality of screens, are displayed on the first touch screen 190a and
      the second touch screen 190b as shown in FIG. 6C, and the touch detected on the first
      touch screen 190a passes through the interval 100d and arrives on the second touch
      screen 190b; then the first screen 615 and the second screen 620 are not changed.
[128]     When the first screen 615 and the second screen 620, which are the first 2 screens
      among the plurality of screens, are displayed on the first touch screen 190a and the
      second touch screen 190b as shown in FIG. 6C, and the touch detected on the second
      touch screen 190b passes through the interval 100d and arrives on another touch screen;
      then the first screen 615 on the first touch screen 190a and the second screen 620 on the
      second touch screen 190b may be changed into other screens 625 and 630.

                                              23
[129]     In another embodiment of the present invention, other screens may be two
      consecutive screens without being limited to the first or last two screens among the
      plurality of screens.   Referring to FIGs. 11 A and 1 IB, the number of screens changed
      by continuous movement of a touch may be changed (e.g., one of the first 2 screens, the
      last 2 screens, two next continuous screens, or two previous continuous screens are
      selected) using the number of screens changed by the Touch Setting item 1106.
[130]     When the first screen 600 and the second screen 610 among the plurality of screens
      are displayed on the first touch screen 190a and the second touch screen 190b as shown
      in FIG. 6B, and the touch detected on the first touch screen 190a passes through the
      interval 100d and arrives on the second touch screen 190b; then they may be changed
      into two previous screens continuing from the first screen 600 and the second screen
      610.     The two previous screens may display images 77 through 88 on the first touch
      screen 190a and images 89 through 100 on the second touch screen 190b.
[131]     Similarly, when the first screen 600 and the second screen 610 among the plurality of
      screens are displayed on the first touch screen 190a and the second touch screen 190b as
      shown in FIG. 6B, and the touch detected on the second touch screen 190b passes
      through the interval 100d and arrives on the first touch screen 190a; then they may be
      changed into two next screens continuing from the first screen 600 and the second
      screen 610.    The two next screens may display images 125 through 136 on the first
      touch screen 190a and images 137 through 148 on the second touch screen 190b.
[132]     In step S506 of FIG. 5, when the controllers 110, 11 Oa, and 1 Ob change the first
      screen 600 and the second screen 610 into other screens 615 and 620 among the
      plurality of screens corresponding to the first order, a screen change method for the
      device 100 having the plurality of touch screens 190a and 190b is ended.
[133]     Returning to step S503 of FIG. 5, if a touch is not detected on the first touch screen,
      it is determined whether a touch is detected on the second touch screen, in step S507.
[134]     Referring to FIG. 6B, the user generates a touch 645 on the second touch screen 190b.
      The controllers 110 and 11 Ob may detect the touch 645 by using the second touch
      screen 190b and the touch screen controllers 195 and 195b.       According to an
      embodiment of the present invention, the number of touches detected on the second
      touch screen 190b is not limited to one, and a plurality of touches may be detected.
      The detecting of the touch in step S507 of FIG. 5 is substantially identical to step S503.

                                                 24
[135]     When a touch is not detected on the second touch screen 190b in step S507 of FIG. 5,
      the screen change method is ended.
[136]     When a touch is detected on the second touch screen 109b in step S507, continuous
      movement of the touch is detected, in step S508.
[137]     Referring to FIG. 6B, the controllers 110 and 1 Ob may detect continuous movement
      of the touch 645 among at least one touch contacting the second touch screen 190b by
      using the second touch screen 190b and the touch screen controllers 195 and 195b.
      Continuous movement of the touch 645 may be stored in a storing unit of the device 100.
      The touch contacting the second touch screen 190b may be a single touch or a plurality
      of touches.    The detecting of continuous movement of a touch in step S508 of FIG. 5 is
      substantially identical to step S504.
[138]     In step S509 of FIG. 5, arrival of the touch on the first touch screen is detected.
[139]     Referring to FIG. 6B, the touch starts from the second touch screen 190b, passes
      through the interval 100d, and then arrives on the first touch screen 190a.      The
      controllers 110, 1 10a and 1 10b may recognize the last position 645b of the touch on the
      second touch screen 190b and the first position 645c at which the touch arrives on the
      first touch screen 190a, by using the touch screens 190a and 190b and the touch screen
      controllers 195, 195a, and 195b.       The detecting of arrival of the touch 645 on the first
      touch screen 190a in step S509 is substantially identical to step S505.
[140]     The providing of at least one feedback in response to arrival of the touch 645 on the
      first touch screen 190a is substantially identical to the providing of the at least one
      feedback in response to arrival of the touch 640 on the second touch screen 190b, as
      described above.
[141]     In step S5 10 of FIG. 5, the first screen and the second screen are changed into other
      screens among a plurality of screens corresponding to a second order.
[142]     Referring to FIG. 6A, the controllers 110, 11 Oa, and 1 Ob change the first screen 600
      and the second screen 610 into other screens 625 and 630 among the plurality of screens
      corresponding to the second order in response to arrival 645c of the touch 645 on the
      first touch screen 190a.    The other screens 625 and 630 are the last 2 screens among
      the plurality of screens corresponding to the second order of the first screen 600 and the
      second screen 610.     The changing of the first screen 600 and the second screen 610
      into other screens among the plurality of screens in step S5 10 of FIG. 5 is substantially

                                                25
      the same as step S506.
[143]    In step S510 of FIG. 5, when the controllers 110, 110a, and I1Ob change the first
      screen 600 and the second screen 610 into other screens 625 and 630 among the
      plurality of screens corresponding to the second order, the change screen method for the
      device 100 having the plurality of touch screens 190a and 190b is ended.
[144]    Referring to FIGs. 6A through 6C, the touch screens 190a and 190b are disposed to
      the left and to the right with respect to the interval 100d of the device 100, respectively.
      According to another embodiment of the present invention, the touch screens 190a and
      190b of the device 100, which are capable of rotating clockwise or counterclockwise,

      according to another embodiment of the present invention.
[149]    Referring to FIG. 9B, a first home screen 800 and a status bar 801 are displayed on
      the first touch screen 190a.    The status bar 801 indicates a status of the device 100,
      such as, for example, a charge status of a battery, a strength of a received signal of a
      cellular phone, or a dual-mode icon. The dual-mode icon 801 c is one of a text and an
      icon, which indicates whether the plurality of touch screens 190a and 190b of the device
      100 operate.     The first home screen 800 includes a third display area 802 on which a
      counter 803 indicating a position of a current home screen, a widget 804, or a short-cut
      icon is displayed.
[150]    The home screen is a standby screen for which a desired item (e.g., a background of
      the home screen) may be changed by using an Environment Setting 1100, shown in FIG.

                                               26
      11 A, or an input set in the device 100 (e.g., a long touch of the home screen) by the user.
      By using the widget 804 or the short-cut icon displayed on the home screen, various
      functions may be immediately used.       The first home screen 800 is one of a plurality of
      home screens provided by the device 100.
[151]    According to an OS or an application of the device 100, the status bar 801 may not
      be displayed on the first touch screen 190a.     When the status bar 801 is not displayed,
      only the first home screen 800 may be displayed on the first touch screen 190a.
[152]     The plurality of home screens displayed on the touch screens 190a and 190b may
      correspond to home counters 803 and 813.        Referring to the counter 803, the first home
      screen 800 is the third one among a total of 7 home screens.
[153]     In step S802 of FIG. 8, a second home screen continuing from the first home screen
      is displayed on a second screen.
[154]     Referring to FIG. 9B, a second home screen 810 and a status bar 811 indicating a
      status of the device 100 are displayed on the second touch screen 190b.      The second
      home screen 810 includes a fourth display area 812 on which the counter 813 indicating
      a position of a current home screen, the widget 814, or a short-cut icon is displayed.
      The second home screen 810 is one of the plurality of home screens.       According to a
      determined order, the second home screen 810 is a home screen continuing from the
      first home screen 810 in an ascending sequence (e.g., according to a first order, a next
      home screen with respect to the first home screen 800) or a home screen continuing
      from the first home screen 800 in a descending sequence (e.g., according to a second
      order, a previous home screen with respect to the first home screen 800).      Referring to
      the counter 813, the second home screen 810 is the fourth one among the total of 7
      home screens.
[155]    According to an OS or an application of the device 100, the status bar 811 may not
      be displayed on the second home screen 810.        When the status bar 811 is not displayed,
      only the second home screen 810 may be displayed on the second touch screen 190b.
[156]     In step S803 of FIG. 8, it is determined whether a touch is detected on a first touch
      screen.
[157]     Referring to FIG. 8B, the user generates a touch 840 on the first touch screen 190a.
      The controllers 110 and 11 Oa may detect the touch 840 by using the first touch screen
      190a and the touch screen controllers 195 and 195a.      The controllers 110 and 1 10a

                                               27
      may receive the first position 840a (e.g., X and Y coordinates) on the first home screen
      800 corresponding to the touch 840 from the touch screen controllers 195 and 195a.
      The controllers 110 and 1 10a may store a touch position on the first touch screen 190a
      and a touch time at which the touch 840 is detected on the first touch screen 190a in the
      storing unit.    The touch 840 contacting the first touch screen 190a may be generated by,
      for example, one of the user's fingers or a touch of a touchable object.
[158]     In another embodiment of the present invention, the number of touches detected on
      the first touch screen 190a is not limited to one, and a plurality of touches may be
      detected.    When the plurality of touches are detected on the first touch screen 190a, the
      controllers 110 and 11 Oa may store a plurality of touch positions and a plurality of touch
      times at which the plurality of touches are detected in the storing unit.   The number of
      detected touches can be easily understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.
[159]     When a touch is not detected on the first touch screen 190a in step S803, the
      methodology proceeds to step S807.
[160]     However, when a touch is detected on the first touch screen 190a, continuous
      movement of the touch is detected, in step S804.
[161]     Referring to FIG. 9B, the controllers 110 and 1 Oa may detect continuous movement
      (e.g., a plurality of X and Y coordinates corresponding to a continuous touch) of a touch
      among at least one touches contacting the first touch screen 190a by using the first
      touch screen 190a and the touch screen controllers 195 and 195a. The continuous
      movement of the touch may be stored in the storing unit of the device 100.      The touch
      contacting the first touch screen 190a may be a single touch or a plurality of touches.
[162]     Continuous movement of a touch (e.g., movement from 840a to 840b) means a part
      of a continuous touch gesture (e.g., movement from 840a to 840d) of the touch from the
      first touch screen 190a to the second touch screen 190b.     Continuous movement of a
      touch (e.g., movement from 840c to 840d) means a part of the continuous touch gesture
      (e.g., movement from 840a to 840d) of the touch from the first touch screen 190a to the
      second touch screen 190b.      Continuous movement of a touch also means that a contact
      is kept continuous on the first touch screen 190a and the second touch screen 190b,
      except for in the interval 100d between the first touch screen 190a and the second touch
      screen 190b.      The continuous movement of the touch has non-contact positions in the
      interval 100d and the last position 840d on the second touch screen 190b.

                                               28
[163]     Referring to FIG. 9B, continuous movement of a touch from the first touch screen
      190a to the second touch screen 190b includes, for example, drag and drop or flick
      touch gestures.
[164]     In step S805 of FIG. 8, arrival of the touch on the second touch screen is detected.
[165]     Referring to FIG. 8B, the touch starts from the first touch screen 190a, passes
      through the interval 100d between the first touch screen 190a and the second touch
      screen 190b, and arrives on the second touch screen 190b.       The controllers 110, 1 10a,
      and 1 10b may recognize the last position 840b of the touch on the first touch screen
      190a and the first position 840c of the touch arriving on the second touch screen 190b
      by using the touch screens 190a and 190b and the touch screen controllers 195, 195a,
      and 195b.
[166]     The controllers 110, 11 Oa, and 1 Ob may detect arrival of the touch on the second
      touch screen 190b by using a time at which the touch passes through the interval 100d
      (e.g., a second time interval), an area determined on the second touch screen 190b, or a
      direction determined on the second touch screen 190b (e.g., an allowable inclination
      range).
[167]     FIGs. 7A through 7C are diagrams illustrating arrival of a continuous touch
      generated on a touch screen onto another touch screen, according to embodiments of the
      present invention, and as described above with respect to FIGS. 5 and 6A.
[168]     The controllers 110, 1 10a, and 1 Ob may provide a feedback responding to arrival
      840c of the touch on the second touch screen 190b to the user.      The provided feedback
      may be at least one of a visual feedback, an audible feedback, or a tactile feedback, as
      described above with respect to FIGS. 5 and 6A.       For example, the controllers 110,
      11 0a, and 11 Ob may provide a combination of a visual feedback, an audible feedback,
      and a tactile feedback to the user.
[169]     In step S806 of FIG. 8, the first home screen and the second home screen are
      changed into other home screens among the plurality of home screens corresponding to
      the first order.
[170]     Referring to FIG. 9C, the controllers 110, 1 10a, and 1 Ob change the first home
      screen 800 and the second home screen 810 into other home screens 815 and 820
      among the plurality of home screens corresponding to the first order, in response to
      arrival 840c of the touch on the second touch screen 190b.      The other home screens

                                               29
      815 and 820 display the first 2 home screens (e.g., '1' is displayed on the counter 803 of
      the first touch screen 190a and '2' is displayed on the counter 813 of the second touch
      screen 190b) among the plurality of screens which correspond to the first order of the
      first home screen 800 and the second home screen 810 and continuous movement of a
      touch.
[171]     When arrival of the touch on the second touch screen 190b is detected, change of the
      first home screen 800 and the second home screen 810 into the other home screens 815
      and 820 may start.    When arrival of the touch on the second touch screen 190b is
      detected, change of the first home screen 800 and the second home screen 810 into the
      other home screens 815 and 820 may start after a second delay (e.g., 0.2 sec).      Change
      of the first home screen 800 and the second home screen 810 into the other home
      screens 815 and 820 may be completed before, upon, or after completion at the last
      position 840d of the continuous movement of the touch.
