   ABSTRACT
           A system for electronic patient care, the system comprising: a network; a facility
   gateway configured to provide a publish-subscribe service for applications executed within
   the facility gateway for communication among the applications; a device gateway
 5 configured for execution by the facility gateway, the device gateway is configured to
   communicate via the network by providing a web service; a medical device in operative
   communication with the network; a publish-subscribe engine configured to provide the
   publish-subscribe service for communication between a plurality of applications including
   the device gateway, the plurality of applications being executed within the facility gateway,
10 and a continuous quality improvement listener configured for execution by the facility
   gateway, wherein: a device application subscribes to a registered topic using the publish
   subscribe engine, the device application receives an event stream of the registered topic
   from the publish-subscribe engine, the event stream includes a plurality of raw medical
   device events from the medical device, when the device application receives a medical
15 device event corresponding to a reportable event, the device application republishes the
   reportable event as a continuous-quality-improvement ("CQI") message via the publish
   subscribe engine the continuous quality improvement listener subscribes to a reportable
   biomed event topic and to a reportable clinical even topic, the continuous quality
   improvement listener is configured to communicate a reportable biomed event received by
20 the subscription to the reportable biomed event topic to an external database, and the
   continuous quality improvement listener is configured to communicate a reportable clinical
   event received by the subscription to the reportable clinical event topic to the external
   database.

35 BACKGROUND
   Relevant Field

   [0001]          The present disclosure relates to patient care. More particularly, the present
   disclosure relates to a system and apparatus for electronic patient care.
   Descriptionof Related Art
   [0002]          Providing patient care in a hospital generally necessitates the interaction of
 5 numerous professionals and caregivers (e.g., doctors, nurses, pharmacists, technicians, nurse
   practitioners, etc.) and any number of medical devices/systems needed for treatment of a
   given patient. Despite the existence of systems intended to facilitate the care process, such
   as those incorporating electronic medical records ("EMR") and computerized provider order
   entry ("CPOE"), the process of providing comprehensive care to patients including ordering
10 and delivering medical treatments, such as medications, is associated with a number of non
   trivial issues.
   [0003]          Despite the existence of systems incorporating electronic medical records
   ("EMR") and computerized provider order entry ("CPOE"), the process of ordering and
   delivering medical treatments still has the potential to cause critical information to be
15 miscommunicated, to allow treatment decisions to be made without ready access to
   complete information, and to delay implementation of treatment orders due to unnecessarily
   redundant and inefficient procedures.
   [0004]          Medication errors may be responsible for over 300 deaths and may injure
   over one million people each year in the United States. Hospitals under financial stress may
20 experience an increased incidence of medication errors. Medications associated with the
   most dangerous errors include insulin, narcotics, heparin and chemotherapy.        Sources of
   error include administering the wrong drug, the wrong concentration of drug, at the wrong
   rate, or via the wrong route (medications can be administered orally, intravenously,
   intramuscularly, subcutaneously, rectally, topically to the skin, via the eye or ear,
25 intrathecally, intraperitoneally or even intravesically). Even with proper orders and proper
   labeling, medications still can be administered improperly because of illegible handwriting,
   miscommunication of orders, and mispronunciation of drugs having similar names. The
   trend toward the use of electronic medical records (EMR) and bar coding systems for
   medications has been shown to reduce the incidence of medication errors. EMR systems,
30 for example, can facilitate computerized provider order entry (CPOE) and flag orders for
   drugs that do not match a patient's characteristics such as diagnosis, allergies, weight or
   age. However, these systems have not been widely adopted and their implementation can
   result in significant delays and inefficiencies in ordering, preparing and administering
   medications.
35 [0005]          It has been estimated that medication infusion devices are involved in up to
   one third of all medication errors that result in significant harm. The wrong drug may be

   hung, incorrect parameters (e.g. drug concentration or rate of infusion) may be entered, or
   existing infusion parameters may be improperly changed. Of infusion pump-related deaths,
   nearly half may be due to user error and most of these may be due to errors in programming
   the infusion device.
 5 [0006]           An effective monitoring system should monitor and intercede at any phase of
   the medication ordering and administration process to help minimize any of a number of
   adverse events that could result from the treatment.         The medication treatment process
   conceptually can be separated into three phases: a prescription phase, a medication
   preparation phase, and an administration phase. Errors can occur when a prescription is
10 written or entered, when a drug is retrieved for use or mixed in solution, or when it is
   administered to the patient. It would be particularly desirable for a monitoring system to
   not significantly impair the efficiency with which medications are ordered, prepared or
   administered, and preferably to actually reduce the time required to perform those activities
   by collecting, organizing and presenting relevant information for analysis.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0049]          Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of a system 1 for electronic patient care in
   accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. System 1 includes facility IT
35 applications/services 11, a facility 10, and a cloud services 2.

   [00501           The facility 10 may be a hospital, a clinic, a medical facility, an outpatient
   care center, an urgent care center, or a combination or grouping thereof. The facility 10
   may include a facility gateway 21 such that various medical devices 26 can communicate
   with the facility IT applications/services 11 and/or with the cloud services 2. The facility 10
 5 includes various medical devices 26 operated and used by nurses 9 on patients that are in
   the care of the facility 10. The medical devices 26 may be infusion pumps, peristaltic
   pumps, syringe pumps, physiological parameter monitoring devices, other patient-care
   devices, or some combination thereof.
   [0051]           The facility gateway 21 may be hosted, may be in the cloud, may be
10 maintained for the facility 10 by a service provider, may be controlled, maintained or
   serviced by a combination of service providers and/or facility IT 18 personnel, and/or may
   be implemented in a virtual or physical environment. In some embodiments, the facility
   gateway 21 may be implemented in an appliance in a patient's home. The facility gateway
   21 may be used by a hospital, a nursing group, an integrated delivery network ("IDN"), an
15 integrated services group or clinic, a group of clinics, a central clinic, or other healthcare
   facility or infrastructure.
   [0052]           A biomed pc tool 20 may be used by a biomed technician 19 to update the
   software of the devices 26.      The biomed pc tool 20 may be a Browser-based tool for
   Biomed users 19 to monitor the health of their medical devices 26, view log files, track
20 maintenance activities, and manage the installation of software/firmware.          The biomed
   technician 19 may be a hospital employee (or contract service) who installs, upgrades, and
   services medical devices 26 (including infusion pumps) to ensure they are in proper
   working order. The biomed PC tool 20 may interface into the devices 26 via a physical data
   connection, such as a USB connection or serial cable connection so that the biomed
25 technician 19 may perform these services.       The biomed technician 19 may also use the
   device manager 24 to update the devices 26 wirelessly.
   [0053]           The devices 26 communicate with the facility IT applications/services 11
   (via a communications link 343) and/or with the cloud services 2 (via the communications
   link 344) via the facility gateway 21.     The communications links 343 and 344 may use
30 WiFi, Ethernet, TCP/IP, WiMax, fiber optic cables, or any other known communication
   technology.
   [0054]           The devices 26 communicate with the facility gateway 21 by establishing

   may be a computer, a virtual machine, a hardware device, a software device, a hosted
35 device, software in execution, the like, or some combination thereof. The device gateway
   22 may be software executable by the facility gateway 21.               The devices 26 may

   communicate with the device gateway 22 using web services.                  In some specific
   embodiments, only the medical devices 26 initiate communication with the device gateway
   22 (and thus the facility gateway 21).       The device gateway 22 may include a message
   routing engine that supports both publish/subscribe and point-to-point routing mechanisms.
 5 The device gateway 22 may also provide name resolution and capability registry
   capabilities. Object-Relational Mapping may be used by the device gateway 22 for small
   scale object persistence (e.g., using an object-relational mapping (ORM) engine).
   Additionally or alternatively, the device manager 24 can provide name resolution and/or
   registry capabilities.
10 [0055]           In some embodiments of the present disclosure, a device of the devices 26 is
   a monitoring client, such as a tablet computer, a tablet device, a PDA, a smart phone, a
   laptop computer, or a touchscreen-based computer. A monitoring client of the devices 26
   may have a monitoring client app within the device apps 23 which allows a caregiver to
   communicate with other devices of the devices 26. The monitoring client may be used to
15 receive status information from a medical device of the devices 26, receive CQI-messages
   from a medical device of the devices 26, receive RBEs or RCEs from a medical device of
   the devices 26, to program a medical device of the devices 26, or otherwise communicate
   with a medical device of the devices 26.
   [0056]           The communication links 343 between the devices 26 and the facility
20 gateway 21 may use WiFi, Ethernet, TCP/IP, WiMax, fiber optic cables, or any other
   known communication technology. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the
   devices 26 communicate with the facility gateway 21 through a cellular connection (e.g., the
   communications link 343 includes a cellular connection). For example, one or more of the
   devices 26 may be a located within a patient's home, within a clinic, within a field facility
25 (e.g., a tent facility), emergency location, other location, or some combination thereof.
   [0057]           The device gateway 22 may provide: (1) component registry and license
   management         (e.g., using the device manager 24); (2) an installation repository for
   receiving, maintaining and tracking new versions of installable components, such as device
   firmware/software, drug administration libraries, enterprise application software, and
30 infrastructure software (e.g. operating system releases, application servers, database
   management system ("DBMS")); and/or (3) message routing capabilities, such as
   distributing messages, both among applications within the facility gateway 21 and with
   external subsystems (e.g. the cloud services 2).
   [0058]           Deployment environments where medical devices 26 maintain active
35 network connections to the device gateway 22 are called connected environments and may,
   as previously mentioned, be achieved using wireless networks (IEEE 802.11 b/g/n).         Also

   as previously mentioned, in other embodiments, network connectivity may be achieved
   through other technologies, like cellular.
   [0059]          Environments where devices do not maintain wireless connections are called
   standard environments, despite the fact that enterprise application components and external
 5 subsystems may still be connected. In this specific embodiment, the device gateway 22 still
   performs all three roles for enterprise application components and external subsystems,
   while, message exchange involving the devices 26 may use the biomed technician 19 (e.g.,
   using the biomed PC tool 26)to store the messages into an external media device (e.g.
   memory sticks).
10 [0060]          Event subscribers, such as the device applications 23, may refine the event
   stream and republish higher-level events back to the device gateway 22.           Reportable
   biomed events ("RBE"), described below, will be among the events republished by these
   applications. The RBEs may be reported as CQI messages to the cloud services 2. In some
   embodiments, an application running on the facility gateway 21 is a Biomed Server that
15 subscribes to RBEs and stores them in a local database within the facility gateway 21.
   [0061]          Biomed technicians 19 may use their browser to access the device manager
   19 and request device status reports of a device of the devices 26. The UI of the device
   manager 24 may command the biomed server to access the database and generate HTML/JS
   pages for browser display to the biomed technician 19.
20 [0062]          In some embodiments, before a new device of the medical devices 26 is
   authorized for use with the device gateway 22, the biomed technician 19 must register the
   new device using its serial number.        This may be validated using asymmetric key
   (public/private key pairs) encryption, and may be performed as part of the manufacturing
   process. Once a device of the medical devices is registered with the device gateway 22, the
25 biomed technician 19 configures its wireless protocol and encryption settings. Once a
   medical device of the medical devices 26 is registered with the device gateway 22, it reports
   its initial configuration, including model, options, and hardware, firmware and device
   control software version for storage within the device gateway 22 and/or within the device
   manager 24. Similarly, when a device is removed from the list of authorized devices of the
30 device gateway 22, the biomed technician 19 can unregister it.
   [0063]          Each of the medical devices 26 may run a self-test on startup, and publish an
   event the device gateway 22 containing the results.       In addition, because the medical
   devices 26 may routinely run for a long time interval between restarts, the medical devices
   26 may automatically schedule and run certain self-tests at times which do not interfere with
35 patient safety and/or treatment.

   [0064]          The facility gateway 21 includes device apps 23 which may communicate
   data using publish-subscribe data connections (described below). Each device app of the
   devices apps 23 may be for a particular type and/or model of device of the devices 26.
   These applications provide software intelligence to medical devices, by receiving, filtering
 5 and analyzing raw events, and retransmitting higher-level interpretations.      Each type of
   medical device (of the medical devices 26) will have a corresponding device application (of
   the device applications).
   [0065]          The facility gateway 21 also includes a device manager 24 for controlling,
   managing, or monitoring the devices 26. For example, the device manager 24 may be used
10 to update and/or download configuration files into a device of the devices 26. As previously
   mentioned, the biomed technician 19 may control the updating of software, firmware, or
   configuration files of the devices 26. The device manager 24 may provide a Browser-based
   tool for IT managers and/or technicians 18 to monitor the health of the hardware, software
   and network resources used to support delivery of patient care. That is, the facility gateway
15 21 may be managed by a facility IT employee/contractor 18.
   [0066]          When a new dose administration library ("DAL") version is released, a
   secure messaging link may send the DAL file from the DAL manager 5 to the device
   gateway 22 to notify the Biomed technician 19 of its availability. This notification specifies
   the device type, location of the DAL, documentation, release notes URL, checksum, and
20 installation dependencies.    In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the device
   manager 24 has access to the new DAL file, receives the DAL file from the device gateway
   22, receives the DAL file directly from the DAL manager 5, and/or controls the updating of
   the medical devices 22 using the DAL file.
   [0067]          In a specific embodiment, the Biomed technician 19 uses the release notes
25 URL (e.g., via a webpage of the device manager 24 and/or via the biomed pc tool 20) to
   access information about the upgrade, and uses the installer URL and checksum to
   download and validate the DAL file and save it in the device gateway's 22 repository.
   Next, the biomed technician 19 selects one or more of the medical devices 22 to copy the
   new DAL file to which are notified (e.g., via the device gateway 22) that a new DAL file is
30 available for them. On the next medical device restart (of the medical devices 26 that were
   selected to be updated), the selected group of medical devices installs the new DAL version
   (backing it out on error) and notifies the device gateway 22 and/or the device manager 24 of
   the outcome. Any of the procedures described herein to update the DAL file may be used to
   update firmware, software, an OS, or other configuration files of a medical device of the
35 medical devices 26.
                                                  1%17

   [00681          The facility gateway 21 may also include an integration API 25 that allows
   the devices 26, the device apps 23, and/or the device manager 24 to communicate with
   various databases of the facility IT apps 11, such as the Patient Information System 16, the
   Electronic Medical Records 17, the Computerized Physician Order Entry 14, the Laboratory
 5 Information System 15, the Real-Time Location Services 12, and/or other database or
   services 13. The integration API 25 enables the components within the facility gateway 21
   to interoperate with the facility IT applications/services 11. The facility gateway 21 may
   communicate with the facility IT apps 11 via a communications link 341 that may include a
   wireless link, a hardwired link, a TCP/IP link, an internet link, a software communications
10 link, a hardware communications link, or other communications technique or technology.
   [0069]          The electronic medical records may include drug metabolizing data for a
   specific patient. This data may be from clinical test, genetic tests, or form automated tests
   using feedback from patient-care devices. The results of these tests may be used by a
   medical pump 26 to adjust the amount of a particular drug is given to the patent based upon
15 how quickly or slowly the drug is metabolized.
   [0070]          The facility IT apps/services 11 support the administrative functions of the
   hospital (e.g. admission, discharge, transfer, coding, billing, collections, etc.).      The
   integration API 25 isolates differences in the applications 12-16 of the facility IT apps 11
   from the applications 23-24, the device gateway 22, and/or the devices 26. For example, a
20 device of the devices 26 may request from the device gateway 22 programming information
   (or the programming information may be pushed to the device of the devices 16).          The
   patient ID, the pump ID, the drug, and the rate of flow, may reside in one or more of the
   facility IT apps 11; the integration API 25 provides a common format for communicating
   this information to the device 26 regardless of the needs or requirements of the facility IT
25 apps 11. This information may be gathered by the integration API 25 querying various ones
   of the facility IT apps 11 to obtain the data and provide the data to the device 26 in a
   standardized format. The integration API 25 may be capable of being used with a variety of
   facility IT apps 12-17 having different formats, data standards, communication standards,
   encryption standards, etc., but provides a standard interface with the apps 22-24 and/or the
30 devices 26.
   [0071]          The integration API 25 facilitates auto-programming of one or more of the
   devices 26.    The prescription may be sent from one of the servers of the facility IT
   applications 14. The integration API 25 may receive the prescription to reformat it and send
   it to the device gateway 22. The facility gateway 21 may include a clinical server which
35 writes the prescription event to a persistent cache. The clinical server may start an auto
   programming workflow.        This workflow may identify a medical device of the medical
                                                 ,to

   devices 26 corresponding to the target patient and send a command message to the
   respective device of the medical devices 26 to load the prescription. The respective medical
   device of the medical devices 26 will acknowledge receipt of the prescription and display a
   notification on the display. The clinician may locate the medication bag and may use a
 5 barcode reader on the respective medical device of the medical devices 26 to validate the
   medication and patient. The respective medical device of the medical devices 26 may then
   confirm that the medication matches the prescription, and the clinician starts infusion
   delivery.    The respective medical device of the medical devices 26 completes the auto
   programming workflow by sending a message to the clinical server via the device gateway.
10 [0072]           The caregiver uses a UI to verify the programming of a medical device of the
   devices 26.     The clinician locates the medication, and uses the user interface of the
   respective medical device of the medical devices 26 to either verify the auto-programming
   parameters of the medical device of the devices 26 and/or manually program the medical
   device of the medical devices 26.
15 [0073]           The PIS 16 is a departmental system used by the pharmacists 8 to receive,
   review, track and fill orders for prescription medications. The EMR 17 system keeps track
   of patient medical history in the health care institution (encounters, exams, diagnoses,
   procedures, etc.). The CPOE 14 is a system used by doctors or nurses 9 to order lab tests,
   prescription drugs, medical images and other clinical procedures.            The LIS 15 is a
20 departmental system used by lab technicians to receive and process orders for clinical
   samples (e.g. tissue, blood, urine, etc.) The RTLS 12 tracks the location and status of the
   devices 26. The other 13 may be any other database used for patient care.
   [0074]           The cloud services 2 include a cloud-hosted infusion safety manager 3. The
   ISM 3 includes a Continuous Quality Improvement ("CQI") manager 4 and a DAL manager
25 5. The risk officers 6, the nurse managers 7, and the pharmacists 8 may all review the CQI
   messages retrieved by the CQI manager 4 to facilitate the development of a DAL file via the
   DAL manager 5. The DAL file may thereafter be downloaded into one or more of the
   devices 26. The DAL manager 5 may include or is associated with a Drug Error Reduction
   System ("DERS") editor (e.g., the DERS editor 112 of Fig. 4, described below).
30 [0075]           Fig. 2 shows a block diagram of some aspects of the system of Fig. 1 in
   accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.          That is, Fig. 2 shows more
   details of some aspects of Fig. 1.
   [0076]           The device gateway 40, the device manager 41 and the integration API 65
   are all part of the facility gateway 21 of Fig. 1. The large volume app 44, the syringe pump
35 app 54, and the other app 42 are all applications that are part of the device apps 23 of Fig. 1.

   The device manager 41 including its associated database 45 may be the device manager 24
   of Fig. 1.
   [0077]            The Large Volume Pump ("LVP") app 44 is an application for the LVP 36.
   The syringe app 43 is an application for the syringe pump 38, and the other application 42 is
 5 an application for another device 39. The other application 42 and the another device 39
   may correspond to any medical device.
   [0078]            The device gateway 40 provides publish-subscribe data connections 58-64.
   The applications 42, 43, 44 also provide publish-subscribe data connections 49-57. The
   publish-subscribe messaging pattern provides for the communication between the device
10 gateway 40 and/or the applications 41, 42, 43, 44, 65, 72.             However, in additional
   embodiments, another messaging pattern may be utilized for communications.
   [0079]            The CQI listener 72 may subscribe to various data feeds from the
   applications 42, 43, 44 to report CQI messages to the CQI manager 29 which may store
   them in the database 30. The CQI listener 72 may report the raw results of the published
15 connections 49-57 and/or 58-64, and/or may format them.
   [0080]            In some embodiments, the applications 42, 43, 44 reformat the raw events
   from a respective device of the devices 36-39 (that are received via subscriptions to topics
   registered by the device gateway 40) into CQI-messages. The applications 42, 43, 44 may
   register CQI-topics which are subscribed to by the CQI-listener 72. The applications 42, 43,
20 44 publish the CQI-messages into these CQI-topics which causes the CQI-listener 72 to
   receive the CQI messages. The CQI-listener 72 transmits the CQI messages to the cloud
   services 28.
   [0081]            In a specific embodiment, a single GUI interface 33 may be used to view the
   CQI messages within the database 30 while creating a DAL file 35 for use by the devices
25 36, 37, 38, and 39. Software updates 34 may also be sent to the device gateway 40 to
   update the medical devices 36, 37, 38, and 39.
   [0082]            Fig. 3 shows a diagram 73 illustrating the aggregation of several facilities 76
   80 for communication in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The
   several facilities 76-80 may each include a facility gateway 21 (see Fig. 2) for
30 communication with cloud services, such as the infusion safety manager 74.               In some
   embodiments, the several facilities 76-80 are part of a group of facilitates that share a
   common infusion safety manager 74 that is not accessible by other facilities not within the
   group of facilities 76-80.
   [0083]            Fig. 4 shows a diagram illustrating a system 81 for electronic patient care in
35 accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.            The system 81 includes a
   facility, e.g., a hospital network 82, and cloud services 83.

   [0084]          The hospital network 82 includes a hospital information network 84, an
   EMR 85, a CPOE 86, a PIS 87, a LIS 88, an integration engine 89, a integration capabilities
   component 90, a clinical state manager 91, databases 92, 95 and 98, a biomed application
   94, a CQI listener 93, a pump application 96, a syringe application 97, a device gateway 99,
 5 a firewall 100, and medical devices 101.      In some embodiments, systems 84-88 may be
   external to the hospital network 82. A team of biomed technicians 102 may be available to
   use the biomed application 94.
   [0085]          The cloud services 83 includes databases 104, 105, 106 and 113, a firewall
   103, a CQI receiver 108, a CQI server 109, a CQI UI 110, and a DERS editor 112.
10 Pharmacy and clinicians 111 may interface into the DERS editors 11 and/or the CQI UI
   110. Safety staff 107 may interface into the CQI UI 110. The DERS editor 112 and/or the
   CQI UI 110 may be a browser-based interface.
   [0086]          The HIS 84 supports the administrative functions of the hospital (e.g.
   admission, discharge, transfer, coding, billing, collections). The EMR 85 keeps track of
15 patient medical history in the health care institution (encounters, exams, diagnoses,
   procedures, etc.). The CPOE 86 is a system used by doctors to order lab tests, prescription
   drugs, medical images and other clinical procedures. The PIS           97 is   a departmental
   system used by pharmacists to receive, review, track and fill orders for prescription
   medications. The LIS 88 is a departmental system used by lab technicians to receive and
20 process orders for clinical samples (e.g. tissue, blood, urine, etc.). The hospital integration
   engine 89 provides message translation capabilities to enable the information system 84-88
   to interoperate with each other and with external systems. Most of these engines map
   between different dialects of HL7. An Integration Engine may be located on the device
   gateway 99 to interoperate with the HIS, EMR and PIS, through the hospital integration
25 engine 89.    The device gateway 99 provides message routing engine, supporting both
   publish/subscribe and point-to-point routing mechanisms.        The device gateway 99 also
   provides name resolution and capability registry capabilities.
   [0087]          Various devices 101 are used to treat patients, such as infusion devices that
   deliver medication, nutrition and hydration in liquid form to patients via intravenous (IV) or
30 subcutaneous routes. A pump application 96 and a syringe application 97 are applications
   that provide software intelligence to medical devices 101, by receiving, filtering and
   analyzing raw events, and retransmitting higher-level interpretations. Each type of medical
   device of the devices 101 may have a corresponding device application, e.g., one of the
   applications 96-97.
35 [0088]          Each infusion device of the devices 101 may be used to controll delivery of a
   specific infusate (hydration, nutrition, blood or medication in liquid form) to a specific

   patient. Dose adjustments, in the form of loading or bolus doses, or dose titrations may be
   considered to be separate infusion phases within a parent infusion.          A collection of
   infusions for the same patient as part of the same therapy are considered to be an "Infusion
   Story" which may be recorded by a CQI server 109.
 5 [0089]          An infusion may be organized into a setup phase, a programming phase, and
   a delivery phase. During the setup phase, a clinician verifies the infusate, patient and pump,
   and connects the tubing from the infusate to the pump and the pump to patient, which may
   be recorded by the CQI server 109. During the programming phase, the clinician enters the
   dose parameters into the pump and the pump verifies them using the installed DAL version
10 (which may also be recorded by the CQI server 109). During the delivery phase, the pump
   delivers the specified volume of infusate at the programmed rate.
   [0090]          Each of the medical devices 101 may detect alarm conditions (i.e. situations
   where the pump is not infusing), as well as alert and advisory conditions, which may or may
   not be safety-critical. Each of the medical devices 101 may attempt to establish a secure
15 network connection to the device gateway 99. Each of the medical devices 101 may collect
   programming, delivery status and exception events for each infusion and provide them to
   the device gateway 99 so that they may be reported as CQI messages to the CQI receiver
   108. Each of the medical devices 101 may communicate these events to the device gateway
   99, which routes the data to the CQI receiver 108 (directly or indirectly). If or when, in
20 some embodiments, a medical device of the medical devices 101 cannot establish or
   maintain a working connection to the device gateway 99, the medical device may save these
   events in an internal buffer, and permit the biomed technician 102 to copy them to portable
   media (e.g., a memory stick) with or without the use of the biomed application 94. In some
   embodiments, these events may be downloaded via the biomed application 94 running on a
25 personal computer that has a USB cable coupled to the medical device.
   [0091]          The biomed app 94 provides a browser-based tool for biomed users 102 to
   monitor the health of their medical devices 101, view log files, track maintenance activities,
   and manage the installation of software/firmware.      The log files, maintenance logs, and
   software/firmware installation and upgrade tracking data may be stored in the database 95.
30 [0092]          The device gateway 99 may be a beside device that couples to all of the
   devices 101 associated with a particular patient.       In another embodiment, the device
   gateway 99 is a software application executable on a facility gateway.          In yet another
   embodiment, the device gateway 99 is software executable on a bed-side appliance (e.g., a
   compact computer). The device gateway 99 may be a message router, a service registry,
35 and/or a pump authorization registry. The device applications 96-97 can register message
   types and publish messages to the gateway device 99. Any medical device of the medical

   devices 101, including sensors that may plug into a medical device (see other 37 in Fig. 2)
   of the medical devices 101 (e.g. respiratory monitor into PCA) can be used to publish data
   via the gateway device 99.       The device applications 96-97 may act as "information
   refineries." Each of the device applications 96-97 subscribes to messages from a particular
 5 type of bedside device of the medical devices 101 via the gateway device 99. Each of the
   device applications 96-97 can synthesize CQI, clinical, and biomed information from an
   event stream received from one or more of the medical devices 101 through the device
   gaeway 99. In some embodiments, each of the device applications 96-97 re-publishes these
   higher level events to the device gateway 99 or to other subscribers, such as the CQI listener
10 93.
   [00931         In some embodiments, some of the CQI messages may be used for auto
   documentation, auto-programming         and billing functions.      In yet some additional
   embodiments, the CQI messages may be used for auto-documentation from the medical
   device 101 into the EMR 85 and/or for auto-programming of the medical device 101 from
15 an eMAR system (e.g., part of HIS 84). The CQI messages may include drug safety events
   and latency information.
   [0094]         The CQI listener 93 subscribes to events related to continuous quality
   improvement of drug safety and ensures their reliable delivery to the hosted environment.
   The CQI listener 93 may store the events in the database 98 for periodic transmission to the
20 CQI receiver 108 (through the firewall 103).
   [0095]         The CQI receiver 108, the CQI server 109, and the CQI UI 101 may be
   provided in a hosted environment 83 (i.e., cloud services).          A master-slave database
   replication (database 105 as master and 106 as slave) may be used in the hosted
   environment 83 in order to reduce conflicts between user queries and CQI data updates.
25 The CQI server 109 may post-process CQI events into summary (reportable) form prior to
   storing them in the database 105 in order to reduce response time for top-level queries and
   presentation requests.     The CQI UI 110 may provide a series of standard reports
   (compliance, limit violations, titration safety, events by stage, and events by priority). The
   CQI sever 109 may support a query API, to be used by the DERS editor 445 and the CQI UI
30 110 to drill down to more detailed summaries and into details of particular CQI messages.
   [0096]         The CQI server 109 provides analysis and query services for a user using the
   CQI UI 110. The CQI server 109 may provide the user of the CQI UI 110 summary totals
   for CQI messages and update summary tables (on a configurable interval). The purpose of
   these summary tables is to reduce response time for top-level CQI queries.               These
35 summaries may cover the following statistical measures: (1) programming modes used,
   such as infusions using DERS limits vs. wildcard; (2) soft and hard limit violations; (3)

   titration safety information, such as titration increase/decrease settings and dose limit
   violations; (4) reportable clinical events (e.g., RCEs 149 of Fig. 8, described below) by
   priority level; and/or (5) reportable clinical events (e.g., RCE 149 of Fig. 8, described
   below) by infusion stage.        Each of these summaries may compute subtotals for the
 5 following data views: (1) organization name; (2) institution name (e.g., facility name); (3)
   care area; (4) hour of day; and/or (5) week.
   [0097]          A web service query API may be used to enable the CQI UI 110 and/or the
   DERS editor 112 to select: (1) summary totals for each data view described above, filtered
   by the specified selectors; (2) RCE detail by infusion; and/or (3) actual programming, limits
10 and infusion statistics by patient (i.e. infusion stories). In some specific embodiments, the
   DERS editor 112 and/or any system of the hosted services 83 may be based upon a J2EE
   compliant application server. The databases 104, 105, 106, and 113 may use a database
   management server.
   [0098]          Once the J2EE and database management servers are installed and
15 configured, the following shared database tables may be imported to perform a DERS
   database 113 initialization: (1) reference tables, such as units of measure, dose modes, etc.;
   (2) access control tables for administrative users, roles, privileges and permissions; (3)
   DERS medication list; (4) NDNQI care group list;           (5) institution attributes; and/or (6)
   database tables required by the DERS editor 112. The DERS editor 112 may be used to add
20 or edit organizations, add or edit regions, and/or add or edit access control (each with or
   without attributes).
   [0099]          In one embodiment, the DERS Editor 112 and/or the DERS database may
   run in a single application server and database environment for multiple facilities 82. In yet
   another embodiment, each institution 82 may host is hosted in its own virtual environment
25 (e.g., cloud services 2).
   [00100]         The CQI UI 110 and/or DERS editor 112 may support an HTTP/Javascript
   interface for producing CQI reports and interactive drill-down operations to users who are
   running a web browser, in some specific embodiments.
   [00101]         The CQI messages are received by the CQI receiver 108 which stores them
30 in the database 105.      If the CQI receiver 108 cannot process all of the incoming CQI
   messages at a predetermined rate and/or the CQI reciever's 108 buffer is full, the CQI
   messages are temporarily stored in the database 104, which may be accessed by the CQI
   receiver 108 for storage within the database 105 when the CQI receiver is unloaded. The
   database 105 may be replicated by the database 106. The database 106 is user accessible
35 via the CQI server 109 using either the CQI user interface 110 and/or the DERS editor 112.

   [00102]         The CQI databases' 105, 106 records depend on the DERS editor 112. The
   records include: (1) reference tables, such as units of measure, dose modes, etc.; (2) access
   control tables for administrative users, roles, privileges and permissions; (3) DERS
   Medication List; (4) NDNQI care group list; and/or (5) institution attributes.
 5 [00103]         Since these references are dependent on the DERS editor database's 113
   version, consistency is preferable. One option is to share the tables between the databases
   113, 105, 106. While this option is convenient, it increases deployment coupling between
   the two databases 113 and 105, 106. Alternatively, coupling can be reduced by maintaining
   read-only copies of these tables inside the CQI databases 105, 106, with a procedure to
10 update them whenever they are changed in the DERS Editor 112.
   [00104]         Access control for the CQI databases 105, 106 may be similar in structure
   but different in content versus the DERS database 113. Some users may be defined for the
   CQI server 109 but not for the DERS editor 112. Even for those users which appear in
   both, permissions may differ (e.g. some CQI data is read-only).
15 [00105]         Certain database tables (e,g., reportable clinical events and statistical
   summaries) may be required by the CQI databases 105, 106 and are setup when the CQI
   databases are 105, 106 created.
   [00106]         The CQI UI 110 and/or the DERS editor 112 may each utilize data from the
   CQI server 109 (and thus data from the database 106) and data from the DERS editor 112
20 (and thus with the database 113) to generate a DAL file 114.
   [00107]         The clinical state manager 91 is an intermediary between the device gateway
   99 the integration engine 89 which orchestrates asynchronous workflows involving several
   actors and components.
   [001081         Pharmacists and select clinicians 111 use the DERS editor 112 to define dose
25 limits for an institution and create a DAL file 114 (which may be in an XML format). The
   dose limits may be defined using a well-defined, carefully controlled, fully documented
   process, with controlled release procedures. Dose limits may be specified using the DERS
   editor 112 of the DAL manager 5. The facility 82 may use common reference models for
   medications, care areas, dose modes, etc. to facilitate later cross-institutional comparison.
30 The DERS editor 112 may run in the hosted environment 83 such that users access it using a
   web browser. In some embodiments, no client-side software is required to run the DERS
   editor 112 except for a sufficient browser. The DERS editor 112 may provide dose limits
   and defaults that are organized by care area, medication, clinical use and drug
   concentration. The DERS editor 112 may support a query interface to the CQI server 109 to
35 integrate the search and analysis of CQI insights to improve the next DAL version.

   [00109]         Fig. 5 shows a drug safety method 115 used to generate a DAL file in
   accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The method 115 may be used
   with the system 1 of Fig. 1, the system 27 of Fig. 2, the system 81 of Fig. 4, or any other
   electronic patient care system.
 5 [00110]         Participants from a pharmacy and clinical care area (e.g., selected users from
   6, 7, 8, 9, 18, and 18 of Fig. 1 or 102, 107, and 111 of Fig. 4) may be selected to help
   generate and define a DAL File 35 (see Fig. 2) that contains safety rules for drug infusions
   that may consider the type of medication, clinical care area, dose mode (e.g. amount-based,
   rate-based or weight-based, dose strategy (loading, bolus, ramp), etc.
10 [00111]         Method 115 includes acts 116 and 117. Act 116 includes acts 118-125 as
   subacts and act 117 includes acts 126-127 as subacts. Act 116 generates a DAL file and act
   117 monitors the use of the DAL file to update the DAL file 35 (see Fig. 2).
   [00112]         Act 122 sets up a DAL file, e.g., an initial DAL file without field entries or a
   template DAL file. Act 123 receives modifications to the DAL file in accordance with an
15 entry from one of the selected users (e.g. via the GUI interface 112 of Fig. 4). Act 121
   reviews the DAL file, e.g., by running a medical device simulator via the GUI interface 112
   of Fig. 4. After review during act 121, a pilot DAL file is (electronically) released in act
   120.    Act 118 approves the pilot DAL file.       However, after the pilot has completed,
   adjustments may be made to the DAL.          Act 118 may be performed via clicking on a
20 "approve" button on a web browser to approve the use of a referenced file (e.g., referenced
   by version number, creation date, etc.).
   [00113]         In act 119, the DAL file is released and is sent to the medical device in act
   127. In Act 125, the CQI server imports reference data (i.e. medications, care areas, dose
   modes, etc.) from the DAL file. Upon DAL release, a file containing the dose records is
25 released to both the hospital and to the CQI environment. A biomed technician installs the
   DAL on each infusion device after release in act 119. Act 126 is the medical device sending
   CQI events to the CQI receiver 108.
   [00114]         During infusions, medical devices generate CQI events (i.e., CQI messages).
   The CQI messages may include information about when a normal infusion occurs, when an
30 infusion bypasses the DERS checks, when a soft limit is exceeded and overridden, and/or
   when a soft or hard limit is exceeded and the dose is reprogrammed, among others
   [00115]         The CQI events are transmitted to a CQI Server in act 126, which collects
   and stores them. Safety officers can run reports which summarize these events and provide
   drill-down capabilities to identify opportunities for procedural improvement in act 124.
35 Similarly, pharmacists and clinicians can query the CQI database to identify opportunities to
   improve dose records in the next release of the DAL in act 124. That is, in act 124, the CQI

   messages are analyzed or reviewed. Modifications to the DAL file may be made in act 123
   to create a new version of the DAL file.
   [00116]         Fig. 6 illustrates a method 128 of infusing a medication in accordance with
   an embodiment of the present disclosure. The method 128 includes acts 129, 131,133, 134,
 5 and 135. The method 128 may be used with the system 1 of Fig. 1, the system 27 of Fig. 2,
   the system 81 of Fig. 4, or any other electronic patient care system.
   [00117]         In act 129 a physician writes a prescription electronically.      The order is
   entered into the CPOE 130, which is electronically sent to a pharmacy. In act 131, the
   pharmacist reviews the order, making assessments for drug interactions and medication
10 supply, and either fills the prescription or modifies the prescription (e.g., in consultation
   with the physician). Also in act 131, the prescription is perfected and an order is submitted
   to a PIS 132. In act 133, the prescription is dispensed. This may be done by (including by
   not limited to): using a pre-prepared compound with the medication already in the desired
   concentration;    the pharmacist compounding the desired dose and concentration in the
15 pharmacy; and/or a clinician (e.g., nurse) compounding the desired dose and concentration
   at the bedside of the patient.
   [00118]         Next, the dose is administered to the patient in act 134.       In an inpatient
   setting (hospital or nursing home), a clinician typically performs the dose administration. In
   an ambulatory or home setting, administration may be performed by a clinician, a family
20 member of the patient, or by the patient themselves.     Drug safety procedures seek to ensure
   that the "right patient," "right medication," "right dose," "right time" and "right route" tests
   are met.    This may be achieved in several ways, including by a bedside point-of-care
   system, by bar coding the patient and medication, and/or by using auto-programming.
   Documentation of the record is submitted to a record keeping system in act 135. In act 135,
25 documentation is provided to an EMR system to update the patient's chart.
   [00119]         Fig. 7 illustrates a method 137 to update a medical device with software,
   firmware, and/or a configuration file in accordance with an embodiment of the present
   disclosure. The method 137 includes acts 138-143. The method 137 may be used with the
   system 1 of Fig. 1, the system 27 of Fig. 2, the system 81 of Fig. 4, or any other electronic
30 patient care system.
   [00120]         In act 138, a biomed technician 19 (see Fig. 1) installs the software,
   firmware, or configuration files on a medical device (e.g., for the first time) and/or in act
   140, the biomed technician upgrades the software, firmware, or configuration files on a
   medical device. In act 139, the medical device is configured or reconfigured. Acts 138,
35 139, and/140 may be performed wirelessly or through a physical connection between a
   biomed tool 20 (see Fig. 1) and the medical device.

   [00121]         A biomed technician 19 can perform act 138 and/or act 140. In act 141 the
   medical device is monitored (e.g., via CQI messages, etc.) In      some    embodiments,      a
   biomed technician 19 can copy CQI event files from infusion devices to portable memory
   sticks for subsequent upload to a CQI server. Act 141 may be used to: identify when
 5 devices need to be scheduled for preventative maintenance; identify if the medical device
   needs to download software, firmware, configuration files or other updates and upgrades;
   upload device log files; and/or perform other diagnostic and maintenance tasks.
   [00122]         Act 141 monitors the medical device (e.g., wirelessly). Act 142 determines
   if any issues are identified in the medical device. Issues, such as, the medical device is not
10 operating within predetermined parameters, the medical device is detecting an internal error,
   and/or the medical device determines its software, firmware, or configuration files are out of
   date. In act 143, the medical device is repaired in response to the issue identified in the
   medical device.
   [00123]         Fig. 8 shows a block diagram 144 to illustrate some aspects of a
15 communication between a medical device 145 (e.g., an infusion pump) and a device
   application 151 (e.g., a pump application) in accordance with an embodiment of the present
   disclosure.   Although a pump 145 is described herein with reference to Fig. 8, it is
   contemplated to use any other medical device in place of or with the pump 145 to generate
   the event 146.
20 [00124]         Shown in the block diagram 114 is a medical device 145 (e.g., an infusion
   pump) that communicates an event 146 (e.g., a pump event) to a device gateway 147. The
   pump event 146 may be a CQI-message, may be the basis for a CQI-message, or it may be
   other data, such as raw data, from the medical 145.        The pump event 146 may be an
   operating parameter, a delivery parameter, and/or other operating events. In some specific
25 embodiments, the pump event 146 may use Simple Object Access Protocol ("SOAP") using
   Web Services ("WS") addressing. In some embodiments, the event 146 is communicated
   using Representational StateTransfer ("REST") which may use the full HTTP (or HTTPS)
   protocol.
   [00125]         The event 146 may be an event as shown Table 1 as follows:

             hardware parameters specific to the internal functioning of the device)
                                             Table 1
[00126]         The items listed as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 in Table 1 are pump event
classes. When the medical device 145 is not connected to the device gateway 147, these
events are stored in a local memory buffer of the medical device 145. While connected (and

   once re-connected), these events are published to the device gateway 147 using a secure
   protocol, e.g., SSL, SSH, symmetrical-key encryption, and/or asymmetrical-key encryption.
   As previously mentioned, the device gateway 147 may act as (or contain) a publish
   subscribe engine that is configured to route pump events to interested subscribers.
 5 [00127]          Referring again to Fig. 1 the pump events may be sent to the CQI manager 4
   that relates to the device events of the devices 26. These events may be used to monitor an
   entire fleet of the medical devices 26 across many facilities 10. For example, the Device
   Hardware Status Array 9.71 may be converted to a CQI message and is communicated to
   the CQI manager 4. A user may log into the CQI manager 4 to schedule maintenance
10 events, order new parts based upon the data, to provide predictive or preventive
   maintenance, and/or to order new parts for preventative reasons or predictive reasons. The
   user may use deterministic heuristics to determine what to order, when to order it, and/or
   when to flag some of the devices 26 in various facilities 10 for maintenance.          The CQI
   manager 4 may be used for supply chain management of parts for a fleet of devices 26, and
15 may provide real-time information about the status of the fleet of devices 26. For example,
   the Device Hardware Status Array may include battery information such as the current at
   full charge, which indicates the health of an internal battery. For all of or a subset of the
   devices 26 among several facilities 10, the CQI manager 4 may automatically order new
   batteries when the health of the battery falls below a predetermined threshold. Additionally
20 or alternatively, the CQI manager 4 may automatically schedule for the battery to be
   replaced in these identified devices of the devices 26.
   [00128]          Referring again to Fig. 8, a device application 151 (e.g., a pump application
   configured for operation with a pump) may be executed on the device gateway 147 (in some
   embodiments, they may be different hardware and/or software). The device application 151
25 subscribes to events published by the medical device 145.
   [00129]          The pump app 151 may process the stream of raw events and refine them
   into streams of higher-level clinical events, e.g., the reportable clinical event 149 which may
   be reported to a server of the hosted cloud services for storage therein (e.g., the database 30
   of Fig. 2).
30 [00130]          In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the device application 151 is
   deployed in a J2EE application server as a message driven bean ("MDB"). The MDB is a
   stateless component that subscribes to a Java Message Service (JMS) Topic, e.g.,
   PumpTopic 150. An application server of the device gateway 147 may activate the device
   application 151 on a worker thread when a message is available.
35 [00131]          The device application 151 is a stateful component and contains one pump
   handler 153 instance for each pump 145 deployed in the institution. The pump dispatcher
                                                   AlA

   152 maintains a lookup table of pump handlers 153 using the pump's 145 serial number as a
   unique key.
   [00132]         The pump MDB uses the application server's naming service to access the
   pump application 151. It gets the pump's 145 serial number from the message header, and
 5 uses the pump dispatcher 152 to find the appropriate pump handler of the pump handlers
   153. If the respective pump handler of the pump handlers 153 is busy (processing another
   message, on another thread, etc.), the pump MDB queues the message to the pump
   dispatcher 152 (to ensure messages are processed in sequence).          If the respective pump
   handler of the pump handlers 153 is idle, the pump MDB asks the respective pump handler
10 of the pump handlers 153 to process the event. Each pump handler of the pump handlers
   153 maintains a set of finite state machines ("FSM"), each of which processes a relevant
   subset of the pump events (see Table 1 above), including a pump FSM 156, a program FSM
   157, and a delivery FSM 158.
   [00133]         The pump FSM 156 is the top-level state machine that processes events
15 which do not belong to any infusion. The program FSM 157 is a child state machine which
   is activated when an infusion programming context is started, and is responsible for
   processing infusion programming events. The delivery FSM 158 is a child state machine
   which is activated when infusion delivery is started, and is responsible for processing
   operational events during an infusion. A separate programming FSM 157 and delivery FSM
20 158 may be used because a secondary infusion (incl. loading, bolus, or titration) can be
   programmed while a primary infusion is in progress.            The    medical    device's   145
   operating model , e.g., pump FSM 156, may be used to construct reportable clinical events
   (RCEs) or to construct reportable biomed events (RBEs). For example, the pump FSM 156
   may: keep track of if the pump 145 when it completes one infusion and revert to another
25 which was suspended; keep track of programming of one infusion while another is running;
   and/or keep track of more than one high-priority operational alarm that may occur at one
   time. That is, the pump FSM 156 may include nested state models.
   [00134]         Each pump handler of the pump handlers 153 may also maintain some
   context objects to hold programming and delivery context information.             These context
30 objects will be generated as Biomed Events (for tracking pump utilization) when complete,
   and will be persisted for recovery, in case the pump application 151 needs to be restarted.
   The context objects may include an infusion state, an infusion mode, and an infusion
   segment. The infusion state includes the programming/delivery state data for primary and
   secondary infusions. The infusion mode includes the programming/delivery state data for a
35 particular dose/rate (e.g. loading, bolus, and/or titration). The infusion segment includes the
   delivery state for an operational period within an infusion mode (e.g. pumping, stopped,
                                                   '%i

  alarmed, etc.). Upon processing the pump event 146, a respective FSM 156, 157, or 158
  may transition to a new state, create, update or delete a context object, and output a
  reportable event (a CQI-message), such as a reportable biomed event 148 or a reportable
  clinical event 149. In a specific embodiment of the present disclosure, a list of reportable

   [00135]          Referring to Figs. 4 and 8, the CQI Listener 93 of Fig. 4 may run inside each
   facility 82, can connect to the device gateway (99 in Fig. 4 or 147 of Fig. 8), and subscribe
   to CQI RCEs 149 or the CQI RBEs 148. The CQI Listener 93 of Fig. 4 may establish a
 5 secure private connection to the CQI receiver 108 in the hosted environment 83 (see Fig. 4).
   This connection may be physical (continuously connected) or logical (transient connection
   while transmitting messages).
   [00136]          The device gateway 147 may route the RCEs 149 or RBEs 148 to the CQI
   listener 93. The CQI listener 93 may ensure message durability (i.e. no messages are lost
10 during transmission due to network congestion or disconnection).              As a result, the CQI
   listener 93 may: (1)    store each message to be transmitted to a local persistent queue (for
   buffering); (2) transmits each of the RCEs 149 and/or RBEs 148 from the head of the queue
   to the CQI Receiver 108; and/or (3)     remove the message after receiving acknowledgement
   from the CQI receiver 108.
15 [00137]          The CQI receiver 108 runs inside a hosted environment within 83. The CQI
   receiver 108 listens for and accepts secure network connection requests from one or more
   CQI listeners 93.     The CQI receiver 108 receives RCEs 149 from each connected CQI
   listener 93. The CQI receiver 108 may ensure message durability, so upon receipt, it writes
   each RCE 149 into the database 105.          The CQI receiver 108: (1) stores each message
20 received (CQI messages) to a local persistent queue (for buffering); (2) appends each CQI
   message from the head of the queue to a table in a CQI event database; (3) acknowledges
   receipt of the message to the CQI listener 93 that sent the message; and (4) removes the CQI
   message from the local queue (as it is safely in the CQI event database 105).
   [00138]          As previously mentioned, the CQI Event Database 105 is implemented using
25 a Master-Slave replication. That is, database 105 is the master while database 106 is the
   slave.   With this approach, there are two copies of the CQI event database with identical
   schemas, in some specific embodiments.          As insert, update, and delete transactions are
   applied to the master database 105, a database management system (DBMS) within the
   database 105 writes the changes to a journal, and is able to transmit unposted changes to the
30 slave database 106.
   [00139]          Each CQI message (e.g., a RCE) may belong to a specific institution. This
   institution reference should match the institution which operates the medical device (e.g., a

   medical device of the medical devices 101 of Fig. 4 or the medical device 145 of Fig. 8) and
   which released the Drug Administration Library (DAL) which is deployed in that device.
   As a result, the CQI databases 105, 106 may require a list of institutions which are
   consistent with the DERS database 113.
 5 [00140]          Fig. 9 shows a state diagram illustrating a method 161 of programming an
   infusion device (e.g., of devices 16 of Fig. 1) in accordance with an embodiment of the
   present disclosure. The method 161 begins with the user capable of interfacing with a UI of
   the device.
   [00141]          The infusion programming starts in the state shown as the state labeled as
10 "begin."    State 162 is when the basic mode programming is used (e.g., when a DERS
   compliance exception device is used, for example).          After programming using a DERS
   compliance exception device, the method transitions to state 165 in which the dose
   programming is complete.
   [00142]           State 166 is when the DERS-based protection is used and dose parameters
15 are programmed into the device, which transitions to state 165 if no limit violation is
   detected. If there is a soft limit violation detected or a hard limit violation detected, the
   method 161 transitions to state 167. If it is a soft limit, the clinician may: (1) override the
   software limit which causes the method to continue to state 165; (2) program the infusion
   attributes with unchanged infusion intent, which either continues to state 165 if no new
20 violation is found or to state 167 if a new violation is found; or (3) change the infusion
   intent (medication, clinical care area, clinical use and/or concentration) which causes the
   method 161 to restart at state 166.
   [001431          If a hard limit is detected, the method transitions from state 166 to state 167,
   which requires the state to re-transitions back to state 166 and does not allow the clinician to
25 override the DERS violation.
   [00144]          The infusion method 161 may be cancelled during many states. In the basic
   mode programming state 162, the clinician can cancel the infusion before programming is
   completed.    In the DERS programming state 166, the clinician can cancel the infusion
   before the programming is completed. In state 167 when a DERS soft limit or hard limit
30 violation has been detected, the clinician can cancel the infusion 4.
   [00145]          During state 165, the medical device will present an "infusion start" button in
   which the caregiver can press to transition to medical device to state 163, in which the
   infusion begins. A suspend button is present on the user interface when in state 163, which
   causes the device to suspend when pressed thereby transitioning the device to state 164. A
35 continue button is present on the user interface when in state 164, which causes the device

   to return to state 163 when pressed to continue therapy. If a fatal error (a predetermined set
   of errors) is detected in states 163 and/or 164, the method 161 transitions to the end state.
   [001461          Upon completion of the infusion, the pump sends an infusion complete
   message to the clinical server via the device gateway. The clinical server links the
 5 completion event to the prescription record.        The clinical server formats an IHE auto
   documentation message and sends it to one of the facility IT apps 11 (see Fig. 1), e.g., for
   recording in an Electronic Medical Administration Record ("eMar"), to update the patient's
   Electronic Medical Record (EMR) 17, and/or update the hospital's billing system to record
   successful infusion of the medication.
10 [00147]          Fig. 10 illustrates a publish-subscribe model 168 for used by the facility
   gateway 21 of Fig. 1, by the applications 41, 42, 43, 44 and device gateway 40 in Fig. 2 or
   Fig. 4 in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.
   [00148]          The model uses a pub/sub engine 169 that allows publishers 171 to register
   one or more topics 170 with the pub-sub engine 169. Once the topic 170 is registered, one
15 or more subscribers 172 can subscribe to the topic 170. The subscribers 172 may subscribe
   using a guaranteed subscription to the topic 170, in some specific embodiments. When a
   publisher of the publishers 171 posts an event related to the topic 170, all subscribers of the
   subscribers 172 that have subscribed to the topic 170 receive the data from the pub/sub
   engine 169.
20 [00149]          A publisher (of the publishers 171) may register one or more topics 170,
   each topic may be a unique topic. One or more subscribers 172 may subscribe to one or
   more topics of the topics 170 to receive events therefrom. When a publisher 171 posts an
   event to a unique topic (e.g., a "first topic") of the topics 170, all subscribers to the first
   topic of the topics 170 will receive that event; nonsubscribers to the first topic of the topics
25 170 will not receive that event and subscribers 172 subscribed to other topics (e.g., a second
   optic) of the topics 170 but not the first topic will not receive the event sent that only
   corresponded to the first topic.
   [00150]          The topics 170 may provide a level of indirection enabling the publishers
   171 and the subscribers 172 to be anonymous, in some embodiments. The pub/sub engine
30 169 may allow the communication to be one-way and asynchronous (e.g., a "fire and
   forget" communication). The pub/sub engine 169 may provide durable message delivery,
   on both sides. Durable topics of the topics 170 may ensure that messages will not be lost if
   the pub-sub engine 169 fails. Durable subscriptions used by the subscribers 172 may ensure
   that a subscriber 172 will not miss messages when it is not running.
35 [00151]          The pub/sub engine 169 may be part of the device gateway 22, may be part
   of any other software within the facility gateway 21, or may be a stand-alone application of
                                                  A '7

   Fig. 1. The pub/sub engine 169 may be part of the device gateway 40, within an application
   41-44, or may be a stand-alone application of Fig. 2. The pub/sub engine 169 may be part
   of the device gateway 99 of Fig. 4, may be part of the applications 94, 96, 97, or may be a
   stand-alone application of Fig. 4.
 5 [00152]         Fig. 11 illustrates a capability-registry model 173 in accordance with an
   embodiment of the present disclosure. A provider 176 registers its capability 175 with a
   capability registry 174. The capability 174 may include two aspects, including an interface
   and an attribute. The interface is the list of request/response pairs and notifications (in both
   directions). The attributes is the service level agreement parameters specifying limits on the
10 quality of delivery (e.g. response times, error rates and recovery policies, costs, etc.).
   [00153]          An initiator 177 can communicate with the capability registry 174 to find
   and bind to the capability. Thereafter, the initiators 177 can request information from the
   providers 176 and receive a response. The capability registry 174 may be part of the device
   gateway 22, may be part of any other software within the facility gateway 21, or may be a
15 stand-alone application of Fig. 1. The capability registry 174 may be part of the device
   gateway 40, within an application 41-44, or may be a stand-alone application of Fig. 2. The
   capability registry 174 may be part of the device gateway 99 of Fig. 4, may be part of the
   applications 94, 96, 97, or may be a stand-alone application of Fig. 4.          The capability
   registry 174 may supplement or replace the pub/sub enginge 169 in some specific
20 embodiments.
   [00154]         Fig. 12 shows a block diagram of a system 178 to illustrate communications
   between a medical device 179 and a device gateway 185 in accordance with an embodiment
   of the present disclosure.       The medical device 179 may utilize a device gateway
   communication manager ("DGCM") 342 to communicate with the device gateway 185.
25 The communications may be based on web services, where the medical device 179 is the
   client, and the device gateway 185 is the web server using the HTTPS communication
   transport.
   [00155]         Communication is in the form of transactions, where the medical device 179
   invokes web methods hosted on the device gateway 185 (e.g., a medical-device gateway).
30 The medical device may use a WiFi connection 182 that communicates with the device
   gateway 185 using a WiFi router 183, coupled to a network 184 that is coupled to the device
   gateway 185 via an Ethernet connection 186. In one specific embodiment, TCP/IP provides
   the transport protocol over the network 184, SOAP provides the messaging format that is
   compliant with HTTP, and SSL provides the encryption / authentication required for secure
35 communication (HTTPS). Within the medical device's 179 software, the communications
   manager manages the client side of the web services communication.
                                                   AO

   [00156]          The communications manager communicates with the device gateway 185
   by invoking one of the web methods hosted on device gateway 185 by using SOAP
   messaging and SSL over HTTPS. This may use a SOAP binding 187 for the software
   language used to implement the interface. In addition, the SOAP binding 187 may have
 5 SSL capability to provide secure communication over HTTPS. A web-services description
   language ("WSDL") file is created that defines the web service operations (web methods
   195) and schemas required for the web server of the device gateway 185. A WSDL file
   may be created for the web methods 195 and data types used. Using the WSDL and the
   SOAP provider's utility tool, SOAP client source code files are generated and added to the
10 communications manager software. In order for communications manager to successfully
   initiate a transaction with device gateway 185, the following may be used/set-up: (1)
   OpenSSL 179 installed on the medical device 185 (software 181); (2) device gateway's 185
   host name and IP port stored in the data structure 192; (3) device gateway's 185 public
   certificate data structure 193 reside on the medical device 179; and (4) the medical device's
15 170 private key and public certificate 194 reside on the medical device 179.
   [00157]          The device gateway 185 is configured as a web server and hosts the web
   methods 195 that remote devices (e.g, the medical device 179) access in order to retrieve
   information from or pass information to device gateway 185. Because HTTPS is used for
   secure communication, the device gateway may use a SOAP and SSL interface 187. A
20 WSDL file may be created that defines the web service operations (e.g., the web methods
   195) and the data types required for the web server. A WSDL file has been created for the
   web methods 195 and data types required. Using the WSDL and the SOAP provider's
   utility tool, SOAP server source code files are generated and added to the device gateway
   185 software to facility providing the gateway functions 188.     In order for device gateway
25 185 to process a transaction from medical device 179, the following may be used/set-up:
   (1) OpenSSL 187 (or equivalent software) installed on device gateway 185, which can
   provide a communications port 189 and network connectivity 191; (2) medical device 179
   public certificate may reside on device gateway 185 in a data structure 190; and/or (3) the
   device gateway's 185 private key and public certificate reside on device gateway 185 in a
30 data structure 190.
   [00158]          The web services implementation defines the communications interface
   between the medical device 179 and the device gateway 179 for the purpose of establishing
   communication and exchanging information.           This communication is in the form of
   transactions, initiated by invoking a device gateway 185 hosted web method 195. Four web
35 methods are used to pass information between the medical device 179 (using the DGCM
   342) and the device gateway 185. The web methods are hosted on the device gateway 185
                                                  Anl

   and invoked by the DGCM 342 to initiate an information exchange transaction with the
   device gateway 185.      Each web method may be used for specific types of information
   moving, as identified in Table 3. In one specific embodiment, a list of these transactions
   and associated web methods can be found in the following Table 3:

   [00159]         The Communication Status Check transaction is used to register the medical
   device 179 with the device gateway 185, maintain communication with device gateway 185,
   and to retrieve status regarding available information that the device gateway 185 is holding
   for the medical device 179.      The Patient Infusion Program Check, Patient Instructions
10 Check, Patient Scalar Data Check, Device Information Check, Alert Notification Check,
   Debian Software Package Check, and DAL Configuration File Check transactions are used
   to retrieve available device gateway 185 information that was identified within the prior
   Communication Status Check response from the device gateway 185. The Service Log File
   Post and Engineering Log File Post transactions are used to send log files to the device
15 gateway 185 that were identified within the prior Communication Status Check response
   from the device gateway 185. The Infusion Log Information Post transaction to the device
   gateway 185 is initiated whenever infusion log events available within the medical device
   179 have not been already sent to device gateway 185. Files may be transferred between
   the medical device 179 and the device gateway as a DIME attachment to the SOAP
20 message. The Time Information Check transaction is used to retrieve the device gateway's
   185 time for time synchronization.

   [001601          The web methods 184 are used to retrieve information from the device
   gateway 185 and to pass information to the device gateway 185. The web methods 184 are
   shown in Table 4 with their C-style Prototype as follows:

 5 [00161]          In some embodiments, each passed parameter may be a data structure or an
   int (i.e., an integer data type of C). In other embodiments, any data type may be passed.
   The data structure declarations are shown in Fig. 13. All data structure member pointers
   (other than deviceImageT            199, which is a data structure required by gSOAP's
   implementation) are to null terminated character strings. The parameter list within the web
10 method contains one or more parameters for passing information to the device gateway 185
   (see Fig. 12) and one parameter for receiving information from the device gateway 185.
   The passing parameters can be by value, by reference, or by pointer.            The receiving
   parameter is always the last in the parameter list and is a referenced data type (&dataType).
   Even when the web method does not have information to return, the receiving parameter is
15 still required.     For example, deviceinfusionSendTransaction(...,         int &result) and
   devicefileSendTransaction(..., int &result) use "&result" to meet this requirement.
   [00162]          Each web method has a return value that identifies the transaction
   completion state to the initiator. An exemplary set of return values are provided in Table 5

   [00171]         Fig. 14 shows a flow chart illustrating a method 205 of communication
   between a medical device and a device gateway in accordance with an embodiment of the
15 present disclosure. That is, method 205 is a generic transaction sequence between a medical
   device (using a DGM) and a device gateway. The method 205 may be used by the methods
   shown in Figs. 15-26 to perform their respective transactions.
   [00172]         Generally, a transaction consists of the DGCM 342 of the medical device
   invoking a device gateway hosted web method.             This action establishes an HTTPS
20 connection with the device gateway. During connection establishment, authentication using
   asymmetric encryption is performed between the medical device and the device gateway to
   establish a secure/trust relationship. Once authenticated, an SSL session is established and
   the two endpoints create a common key and use symmetric encryption for data passing.
   The transaction is processed, information is returned, and the HTTPS connection is closed.
25 Up to three transaction retries are attempted to achieve a successful transaction before
   failing. Fig. 14 shows a specific embodiment, i.e., method 205, of this transaction.

   [00173]          The method 205 includes acts 206-232. Act 206 enters the method. Act 207
   initiates the device gateway authentication and requests a certificate. A socket connection is
   established in act 223. In act 224, the device gateway receives the request and sends the
   public certificate to the medical device. In act 208, the medical device validates the public
 5 certificate by comparing it to a local copy. In act 209, the medical device requests that the
   device gateway prove its identify by encrypting data (e.g., predetermined data, such as a
   serial number or ID number of the device gateway). The data is then sent from the medical
   device to the device gateway.
   [00174]          The device gateway may then encrypt a message (e.g., a serial number or ID
10 of the device gateway) using its private key during act 225 and sends the encrypted
   messages to the medical device.         In act 210, the message is decrypted using a public
   certificate of the device gateway.
   [00175]          Act 226 initiates a medical device authentication by requesting a certificate,
   which is received by the medical device, which sends the public certificate in act 211 to the
15 device gateway. In act 227, the device gateway will validate the certificate by comparing it
   with a local copy. In act 228, the device gateway requests that the medical device prove its
   identify by encrypting some data (e.g., predetermined data, such as a serial number or ID
   number of the medical device).
   [00176]          In act 212, the medical device encrypts data (e.g., the predetermined data).
20 The encrypted data is send to the device gateway which decrypts the data in act 229. In act
   230, the device gateway determines if the medical device is authenticated and in act 213 the
   medical determines if the device gateway is authenticated. If both are authenticated, act 214
   establishes a session key. If the device gateway cannot authenticate the medical device in
   act 230, the transaction is terminated in act 231. If the medical device cannot authenticate
25 the device gateway, the medical device will try for up to three times (see 219) and the
   transaction will be considered a failure in act 220 after three attempts.
   [00177]          In act 215, after the SSL session is established in act 214, the medical device
   formats a transaction (e.g., a web method) and uses the ssl symmetric encryption key to
   send the transaction to the device gateway. Act 232 decrypts the web method after it
30 receives the web method, processes the web method, and formats a response.              Act 232
   encrypts the response (e.g., a return value) which is sent to the medical device. The medical
   device decrypts the response and examines the return value in act 216. In act 217, the
   medical device will determine if the return value corresponds to a successful transaction and
   declare a successful transaction in act 218. If the transaction was not a success, act 217 will
35 initiate another attempt by act 219.

   [00178]         Fig. 15 shows a flow chart illustrating a method 233 of communication
   between a medical device and a device gateway to perform a status and communication
   check in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The communication
   status check transaction is periodically initiated by the DGCM 342 to establish
 5 communication with the device gateway (which transitions from Disconnected to
   Connected), to maintain communication with the device gateway (maintain Connected,
   transition to Disconnected), and to retrieve status information regarding available
   information that the device gateway is holding for the medical device.
   [00179]         Method 233 includes acts 234-238 and 240-241. Act 234 initiates the status
10 check every 60 seconds. Act 234 receives the status check request (e.g., the DGCM 342
   receives it). Act 236 sends the requests and establishes a HTTPS connection in act 241.
   Table 239 shows the access list of medical devices that can access the device gateway.
   [001801         In act 240, the device gateway will determine if the medical device is on the
   access list 239 and will formulate a response including the information that is available for
15 the medical device. The response is sent to the medical device which examines it in act
   237.
   [001811         The device gateway sets the Response State to REJECTED if the medical
   device is not a member of the device access list 248. The device gateway sets the available
   information to NONE if it is not available for the medical device, and otherwise sets the
20 appropriate element within the XML-based Response Payload to the values in Table 12 as
   follows:

   [00182]         Fig. 16 shows a flow chart illustrating a method 242 of communication
   between a medical device and a device gateway to synchronize their respective clocks in
25 accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The method 242 implements the
   time synchronization transaction periodically by the DGCM of the medical device to
   retrieve the device gateway's current date and time. The information is used to update the

   medical Device's real-time clock so that it matches the real-time clock of the device
   gateway.
   [001831        Act 243 periodically (e.g., every 90 minutes) initiates a TIME request. The
   request is formatted as a web method in act 245 which communicates it to the device
 5 gateway by establishing a HTTPS connection in act 250.              In act 249, a response is
   formatted, which includes a payload indicating the time of the device gateway.           If the
   medical device is not a member of the device gateway's device access list 248, the state is
   set to REJECTED, otherwise it is set to AVAILABLE. If the state is set to AVAILABLE,
   the device gateway formats the response payload as the number of seconds passed since
10 January 1, 1970. The device gateway communicates the response via a HTTPS connection
   which is closed in act 247 after transmission. Act 246 examines the response by the device
   gateway.
   [00184]        Fig. 17 shows a flow chart illustrating a method 251 of communication
   between a medical device and a device gateway to perform a patient infusion transaction in
15 accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The patient infusion program
   check transaction implemented as method 215 is initiated to retrieve the available patient
   infusion program from device gateway. The patient infusion program may be one or more
   infusion parameters, e.g., flow rate, dose to be delivered, drug to be infused, etc.        The
   transaction is initiated whenever an INFUSION AVAILABLE has been received from a
20 previous communication status check transaction, which triggers the method 251.
   [00185]        Act 252 receives the trigger.      Act 253 initiates a "PROGRAM" request
   which is formatted into a web method in act 254. The web method is transmitted to the
   device gateway via an HTTPS connection that is established in act 259. Act 258 processes
   the web method and formats a response.         The device gateway sets the response state to
25 REJECTED if the medical device is not a part of the access list 257. If a patient infusion
   program is not available for the medical device, the state is set to NONE, otherwise, it is set
   to AVAILABLE.        The infusion program may be part of the payload or references a text
   based infusion program.       The response is communicated to the medical device which
   examines the transaction response in act 255. Act 256 closes the HTTPS connection after
30 the response is transmitted.
   [00186]        Fig. 18 shows a flow chart illustrating a method 260 of communication
   between a medical device and a device gateway to perform a patient instructions transaction
   in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.           This Patient Instructions
   Check transaction is initiated to retrieve the available patient instructions from the device
35 gateway.      The    transaction  (shown    as   method   260)    is  initiated whenever     an

   INSTRUCTIONS AVAILABLE has been received from a previous communication status
   check transaction (e.g., see Fig. 15).
   [00187]           In act 261, the method 260 is initiated.     In act 262, the patient instruction
   query request is initiated, and in act 263, a web method is formatted and sent to the device
 5 gateway using a HTTPS connection that is established in act 268. In act 267, the device
   gateway formats a response which is sent to the medical device. If the medical device is not
   a member of the device gateway's access list 266, the state is set to REJECTED. If the
   medical device is a part of the gateway's access list 266 and no patient instructions are
   available, the state is set to NONE. If the medical device is a part of the gateway's access
10 list 266 and patient instructions are available, the state is set to AVAILABLE and the device
   gateway formats the response payload to reference or include the text based patient
   instructions. After the response is sent, the HTTPS connection is closed in act 265. In act
   264, the response is examined.
   [00188]           Fig. 19 shows a flow chart illustrating a method 269 of communication
15 between a medical device and a device gateway to perform a patient scalar data transaction
   in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The Patient Scalar Data Check
   transaction (implemented by method 269) is initiated by the medical device to retrieve the
   available patient scalar data from the device gateway. The transaction is initiated whenever
   a DATA AVAILABLE has been received from a previous Communication Status Check
20 transaction.
   [00189]           In act 270, the method 269 is triggered. In act 271, the request is initiated
   which is formatted as a web method in act 272. The web method is communicated via a
   HTTPS connection established in act 277 from the medical device to the device gateway.
   The device gateway formats a response to act 276. If the medical device is not a member of
25 the device gateway's device access list 275 the state is set to REJECTED. If the medical
   device is a member of the device gateway's device access list 275 and the patient related
   scalar data is not available, the state is set to NONE. If the medical device is a member of
   the device gateway's device access list 275 and the patient related scalar data is available,
   the state is set to AVAILABLE and the response payload includes or references a text-based
30 scalar data. The patient scalar data may be any data related to a patient, such as patient age,
   weight, allergies, sex, height, etc.     The response to communicated and in act 274, the
   HTTPS connection is closed. In act 273, the medical device examines (e.g., processes and
   uses) the response.
