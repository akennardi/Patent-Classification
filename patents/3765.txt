   FIELD OF INVENTION
          [0001]       The present invention relates to medical dressing and, more
 5 particularly, to a medical patch.
   RELATED PRIOR ART
    [0002]        Technology is advancing, and various medical materials have been
 o devised.    Medical patches are commonly used to heal wounds and/or reduce pain,
   fatigue and/sour in joints and/or muscles.
    [0003]        A conventional medical patch includes a medical layer provided on a
   breathable substrate.     The medical layer includes a mixture of medicine and an
   adhesive material so that it can be adhered to the skin of a portion of a user in need
 5 of medical treatment.
    [0004]      However, the medicine, the adhesive material and/or moisture caught
   between the substrate and the skin could cause allergy in the skin.
    [0005]      The present invention is therefore intended to obviate or at least
   alleviate the problems encountered in prior art.

   SUMMARY OF INVENTION
    [0006]      It is an objective of the present invention to provide a medical patch.
    [0007]      It is another objective of the present invention to provide a medical
25 patch with tourmaline to emit far infrared light to cause resonance with molecules
   of a human body for physical treatment.
        To achieve the foregoing objectives, the medical patch includes a substrate, an
                                                I

   adhesive layer, a layer of medical anoint and dots of tourmaline.     The substrate
   includes an adhesive area extending along an edge thereof.       The adhesive layer is
   provided on the adhesive area.     The adhesive layer and the substrate together
   provide a space.    The layer of medical anoint is filled in the space.  The dots of
 5 tourmaline are inserted in the space.   The dots of tourmaline are used to emit far
   infrared light.
        Other objectives, advantages and features of the present invention will be
   apparent from the following description referring to the attached drawings.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
25
     [0009]     Referring to FIGS. 1 through 3, a medical patch includes a substrate 10,
   an adhesive layer 20 and a piece of releasing paper 30 according to a first
   embodiment of the present invention.
                                              2

     [0010]       The substrate 10 includes an adhesive area 11 on an upper face
   thereof.   The adhesive area 11 extends around an edge of the substrate 10.
     [0011]       The adhesive layer 20 is provided on the adhesive area 11.       The
   adhesive layer 20 and the substrate 10 together provide a space 21.       Medical
 5 anoint 211 and dots of tourmaline 212 are inserted in the space 21.       The dots of
   the tourmaline 212 are used to emit far infrared light.
     [0012]       The piece of releasing paper 30 covers the adhesive layer 20 and,
   more particularly, the space 21.    The piece of releasing paper 30, the adhesive
   layer 20 and the substrate 10 together close the space 21.
 o   [0013]       Referring to FIG. 3, the adhesive layer 20 is attached to the substrate
    10 along a vertical axis Y.   The adhesive layer 20 is made with an adhesion height
   20H along the axis Y. The medical anoint 211 is filled in the space 21, and the
   thickness of the layer of the medical anoint 211 is smaller than the adhesion height
   20H.    The dots of tourmaline 212 are evenly distributed in the space 21.       Each of
 5 the dots of tourmaline 212 is inserted in the medical anoint 211.       The thickness of
   each of the dots of tourmaline 212 is not larger than the adhesion height 20H.
     [0014]       Referring to FIG. 1, the substrate 10 is in a circular shape, and the
   adhesive layer 20 is in an annular shape.
     [0015]     Referring to FIG. 4, according to a second embodiment of the present
20 invention, the substrate 10 is in a square shape, and the adhesive layer 20 is in a
   square annular shape.
     [0016]     Referring to FIG. 5, according to a third embodiment of the present
   invention, the substrate 10 is 8-figured, i.e., it looks like gourd or a dumbbell, and
   the adhesive layer 20 is in the form of an 8-figured ring.      Thus, the medical patch
25 is particularly useful for a length wound.
     [0017]       Advantageously, the adhesive layer 20 extends along the edge of the
                                               3

  substrate 10.   In use, the edge of the substrate 10 and the adhesive layer 20 are
  adhered to a user's skin.    The medical patch can be kept firmly on the user's skin
  at a joint when the joint is bent.  This is because the adhesive layer 20 firmly
  adheres to the user's skin, thereby avoiding peeling of the substrate 10 from the
5 user's skin, and thereby avoiding dropping of the medical anoint 211 from the
  space 21.
    [0018]      Moreover, the dots of tourmaline 212 are inserted in the space 21, and
  the dots of tourmaline 212 emit far infrared light with wavelength of 4 to 14 [tm.
  Such far infrared light with wavelength of 4 to 14 [tm causes resonance with the
o molecules of a human body.
    [0019]     The present invention has been described via the illustration of the
  embodiments.      Those skilled in the art can derive variations from the
  embodiments without departing from the scope of the present invention.
  Therefore, the embodiments shall not limit the scope of the present invention
5 defined in the claims.
