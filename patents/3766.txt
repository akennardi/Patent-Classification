ABSTRACT
A gear or engine oil or other type of lubricant, which effectively reduces churning losses in a dip
lubrication system or any lubrication system where churning loss occur has a surface tension less than
28 mN/m and viscosity less than 400 mPa-sec at 25 0C (about 500 cSt at 25 0C). Formulations include
Group 1-IV base oil, in combination with an amount of silicone oil effective to decrease the surface
tension of the oil, thereby reducing churning losses. When the base oil is prominently Group Ill, the
coefficient of friction of the gear oil is also reduced.

CHURNING EFFECTS IN DIPPED LUBRICATION", and that application, in its entirety, is also expressly
incorporated herein as if fully set out herein.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]     In dip lubrication systems, also referred to as splash lubrication systems, components such as
gears and crankshafts are rotated through an oil sump.          The rotating components, then splash the
lubricant on adjacent parts, thereby lubricating them.        Drive axles and transmissions typically have
several gear sets that are splash lubricated from an oil sump or reservoir. As the gears turn in the oil, the
gears and bearings are coated with the circulating oil. At high speeds, the gears are essentially pumping
the oil, creating a force corresponding to energy or shear losses in the fluid. Some engines are splash
lubricated by the oil that is thrown from the crankshaft as it rotates. Although one does not want to
unduly reduce the amount of lubricant in the system, the immersion depth of the component into the oil
relates to power loss. The deeper the component is immersed in the oil, the greater the power loss.
Accordingly, it is desirable to reduce power loss without decreasing the overall volume of the lubricant
within the system. Modern engines use pumps to distribute the oil for moving components and there is
power loss associated with the fluid friction inside the tube and the pump.
[0003]    There is a need for a lubrication system and method for reducing power loss, such as in dip
lubrication systems, as well as other lubrication systems with pumps, that addresses present challenges
and characteristics such as those discussed above.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0004]       The present invention, in part, is premised on the realization that power loss in a lubrication
system, such as a dip lubrication system including gears the like, can be reduced by lubricating the system
with a lubricant having a low surface tension and a low viscosity. According to the present invention, the
lubricant will have a surface tension of about 28mN/m or less and a viscosity of less than 400 mPa-sec at
25*C.    Generally, the lubricant will have a surface tension of less than 27mN/m, such as 25mN/m.
However, when formulating a lubricant, additives that reduce surface tension tend to amplify foaming
which increases power loss. The present invention includes lubricant formulations that meet the criteria
of low surface tension, low viscosity and controlled foaming.
[0005]     Further, the present invention is based on the realization that the selection of the appropriate
lubricant in a dip lubrication system can improve efficiency, reduce energy loss and provide improved fuel
efficiency. More particularly, the present invention includes a lubricant which incorporates a Group I, 11,
III, IV or Group V base oil in combination with a silicone oil. The use of the lubricant of the present
invention in a dip lubrication system reduces power losses typically referred to as "churning" and, in
certain applications, provides a reduced coefficient of friction. The present invention includes new
lubricant in dip lubrication systems, as well as in formulations that are more efficient in modern engines,
where the power loss caused by oil pumping is reduced. The aspects and advantages of the present
invention will be further appreciated in light of the following detailed description and drawings.

versus a standard formulation; and
[0007]       Figure 2 is a chart showing the temperature comparison of formulations of the present
invention versus a standard lubricant.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0008]       Dip lubrication is the name given to systems in which lubricants are distributed in enclosed
mechanical systems, such as gearboxes, engines or axles in which a rotating component is partially

                                                       -3
submerged in a reservoir of oil.        Operation of the machine and subsequent rotation of the dipped
component leads to distribution of the oil to its required destination, typically the bearings or other
running components within the system. Dip lubrication may be contrasted with spray or jet lubrication,
in which the lubricating fluid is directly pumped by a dedicated lubrication system. Dip lubrication,
therefore, incurs lower manufacturing costs.          However, this is achieved by sacrificing control.   For
example, it is difficult in a dip system to vary the flow rate to take into account the bearing requirements
of the lubricated system. In addition, dip lubrication systems are incompatible with fine filtration and can
suffer from significant power losses, especially at higher rotational speeds.
 [0009]       In a typical gearbox, power losses occur because of the friction between the rubbing gear
teeth and between the surfaces of the bearing and seal components. In addition, there are losses due to
the acceleration of, and viscous dissipation within, the circulated liquid. It is this power loss, usually
known as "churning", which is addressed by the present invention.
 [0010]       Earlier engines use a splash lubrication to supply oil to the working components using the
connecting rods. The big ends of the connecting rods, often made with oil scoops, dig into a lubricant
sump each time the piston passed through the bottom dead center position. Such lubrication systems
were not efficient and inherently limited engine life. Certain engines employed a combined splash and
forced lubrication system, also called the combined system. An engine-driven gear pump was used to
deliver oil only to the main bearings; the rod bearings and other working parts were lubricated just as in
the splash system. Today there are a few racing engines that use the combined lubrication system. The
present invention will address churning losses in such engines.
 [0011]       An increase in engine power demand and reduction in size required a more reliable and
consistent lubrication system. A forced lubrication system is implemented to satisfy the loads and speeds
at which engine components are expected to operate. The engine bearings are lubricated and cooled by
the oil circulating through them. Oil under pressure is supplied to the valve rocker arms and valve stems,
crankshaft main bearings, connecting rod big-end bearings and camshaft bearings using a pump like a
gerotor type. The pump extracts oil from the oil pan through a pickup tube and maintains oil pressure
within a specified range using a pressure relief valve. The pumping ability for lubrication system based on
the oil properties will be addressed by the present invention.
 [0012]        In general, a lubricant for use in the present invention will have a low surface tension and a
low viscosity. For use in the present invention, the lubricant must have a surface tension of less than 28
mN/m, 27 mN/m, such as 25mN/m or lower. Further, the viscosity of the lubricant should preferably be

                                                      -4
less than 400 mPa-sec at 25*C (less than about 500 cSt @ 25 *C). According to the present invention,
specific lubricants have been formulated which also provide reduced power loss in various lubrication
systems.
 [0013]      A lubricant, according to the present invention, includes base oil in combination with silicone
oil at the minimum. Other lubricant additives are added as needed for meeting particular lubricant
specifications, including components, as specified herein, to reduce foaming. The base oil is compatible
with silicone oil and the lubricant is predominantly (at least 40%) a Group I, Group II, Group Ill, Group IV
or Group V base oil (excluding silicone oil) (as designated by the American Petroleum Institute (API)) with
a viscosity of 2-100 cSt at 100*C, and preferably a viscosity index of at least 130 preferably above 160 or
higher like 250. Groups I and 11base oils are commonly used as gear oils in certain geographic regions,
while Group Ill and Group IV base oils are used in other regions.
 [0014]      Group Ill base stocks are made from hydrogenation during which a mineral oil is subjected to
hydrogenation or hydrocracking under special conditions to remove undesirable chemical compositions
and impurities, resulting in a mineral oil- based oil having synthetic oil components and properties.
Typically the hydrogenated oil defined as Group Ill is petroleum-base stock with a sulfur level less than
0.03, severely hydro-treated and iso-dewaxed, with saturates greater than or equal to 90 and a viscosity
index greater than or equal to 120.
 [0015]      The Group IV base stocks are polyalphaolefins. Polyalphaolefins (PAOs) are also hydrocarbon
base stock oil, as previously described in the lubricating oil trade. PAOs are derived by the polymerization
or co-polymerization of alphaolefins having 2 to 32 carbons. More typically, C8, C1O, C12, C14 olefins or
mixtures thereof.
 [0016]      Group V base stocks are classified as all base stocks other than Group I, 11,111and IV. Examples
include phosphate ester, polyalkylene glycol (PAG), polyolester, biolubes, etc. Mainly these base stocks
are mixed with other base stocks to enhance the oil performance. Esters are common Group V base oils
used in different lubricant formulations including engine and gear oils. Ester oils improve performance at
higher temperatures and will increase drain intervals by providing superior detergency compared to PAO
synthetic base oil. For purposes of the present invention, silicone oil, which is a Group V oil, is not used
as the base oil in the present invention.
 [0017]       For use in the present invention, the base oil will comprise 40 to about 95% of the gear oil of
the present invention with the additive package being 5 to 60% by weight.

                                                      -5
 [0018]      In addition to the base oil for use in the present invention, the gear oil of the present
invention will include 0.01 to about 5 wt% of silicone oil. Silicone oil acts to reduce surface tension and, in
combination with Group Ill base oils, reduces the coefficient of friction. The silicone oil can be used in
amounts from about 0.01 to about 5%, 0.02 to about 0.5%, 0.1 to 0.5% with good results achieved at
0.2% silicone oil. A wide range of different viscosities can be used, including 10, 20, 50, 100, 350, 1000,
5000, 10,000 and 60,000 centistokes at 25*C. Suppliers of such silicone oils include Xiameter PMX-0245,
 Dow Corning 200 and 510. Silicone oil Dow Corning 200 is described in US Patent 7,273,837 as
polydimethylsiloxane.        US Patent 8,592,376 states that Dow Corning Xiameter PMX-0245                    is
cyclopentasiloxane. US Patent 5,789,340 states that "Dow-Corning 510 Silicone Fluid is a mixture of
dimethyl and methyl phenyl siloxanes. The higher viscosity silicone oils reduce friction, but tend to
separate from the base oil. Lower viscosity silicone oil remains dispersed in the base oil. Therefore,
viscosities of 10-350 cSt are advantageous, particularly 10-50 cSt at 25 *C. In general, any surfactant that
reduces the surface tension less than 28 mN/m is helpful in reducing the power loss.
 [0019]      In addition to the base oil and the silicone oil, the gear lubricant of the present invention can
include nanographite particles. Typical nanographite particles are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 7,449,432,
the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Generally, the graphite nanoparticles will
have a mean particle size less than 500 nm in diameter, preferably less than 100 nm and most preferably
less than 50 nm. These can be present in amounts from 0% to 15% by weight, more preferably 0.01 to
 10% by weight, and more preferably 0.1% to 5% by weight nanoparticles. The graphite nanoparticles
provide thermal conductivity and lubricity improvements to the lubricant formulation. These can be
manufactured either by a dry method or wet method, as is well known, and can be purchased from
Acheson, U-Car Carbon Company, Inc. and Cytec Carbon Fibers LLC.
 [0020]      Interestingly, nanographite particles can also act as an excellent antifoaming agent when
used with a surfactant. When nanoparticles are added in the formulation, the addition of other
antifoaming agents may not be needed. This is a new use for nano particles in gear oils.
 [0021]      Other typical additives include antifoaming agents such as Nalco EC 9286F-655, Munsing
 Foam Band 159, High-Tech 2030, Tego D515 and Xiameter AFE-1430; dispersant such as HiTec 5777; DI
additive package such as HiTEC 355 and Anglamol 9001N; viscosity index improvers such as HiTec 5738;
viscosity improvers such as HiTec 5760; and seal swell agents such as HiTEC 008.

[0023]        A reference lubricant formed from 64.6% Yubase 4 base oil in an additive package similar to
Formulas 3 and 5 was prepared. The reference lubricant did not include silicone oil or nanographite.
The surface tension of the reference lubricant was 28.91, whereas Formula 3 has a surface tension of
22.19 and Formula 5 has a surface tension of 24 .28. These were subjected to a modified SAE J1266 axle
test. The results of these tests are shown in figures 1 and 2. As shown, the gear oils of Formula 3 and 4
showed a temperature reduction of up to 16.37*C. These three lubricants were tested for varying slide
roll ratios. Formulas 3 and 4 exhibited lower coefficients of friction than the reference lubricant.

[0024]       A PAO-based reference lubricant was formed with a surface tension of 30.23 and compared
with Formulas 1-5. Each oil was then tested for four slide-roll ratios and three temperatures at 1 GPa
contact pressure. The reference oil had the highest friction coefficient. Formulas 2 and 4 gave a lower
friction coefficient for low to medium entrainment speeds and all five formulas performed similarly.
[0025]       Thus, by adding the silicone, the surface tension is reduced and the efficiency is improved.
This works with all types of base oils, in particular Groups Ill and IV.
