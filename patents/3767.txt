                      PORTABLE CART FOR COLLECTING MEDICAL WASTE
[0001]                         The entire contents of Australian Patent Application Nos. 2009262433 and
2015224494 as originally filed are incorporated herein by reference.
[0001A]                        The present invention relates generally to a system for collecting and
temporarily storing solid medical waste. More particularly, the present invention is directed
to a system comprising bag retention features for securing bags to carts used for collecting
waste.
[0002]                         When a medical or surgical procedure is performed solid waste is typically
generated. Generally, this type of waste falls into one of several categories. First, there is
conventional trash. This type of waste includes solid articles such as paper, plastics and
other packaging material that is not contaminated with tissue or bodily fluids. This waste is
typically deposited in white or clear bags. A second type of waste is the linens, towels and
sheets used during the procedure. These linens, towels and sheets, are used for such
purposes as stabilizing the patient, draping off portions of the patient, or cleaning up
liquids. Often these materials, even those covered in bodily fluids, can be cleaned,
sterilized, and reused. This type of waste is typically deposited in green bags. A third type
of solid waste includes solid articles that, during the procedure become coated or exposed
to bodily fluids. These articles include disposable wipes, gloves and drapes used at or
around the surgical site as well as single use disposable medical instruments. Post use,
these articles are disposed of in a manner that ensures the biological material they carry
does not serve as a source of infection. It is also important to prevent contamination of
medical personnel and the medical facility when handling or transporting those waste
materials. Often, this material is called "red bag" waste because it is typically deposited in
specially marked red bags. A fourth type of solid waste is radioactive waste typically
deposited in yellow bags.

                                              -2
[0003]          During the course of a procedure this solid medical waste is deposited in the
corresponding bags secured to portable carts in the operating room or other space in which
                                                                                              and
they are generated. In some medical facilities, separate carts are provided for collection
storing the different types of medical waste as described above. The circulating nurse, or other
health care worker that generates the waste, is responsible for initially categorizing the waste
and placing it in the appropriate bag on a cart. When a bag containing either conventional
waste, red bag waste, or radioactive waste is at or near capacity, it is sealed. At that time, the
bag is transported to a loading dock for eventual transport to a waste processing facility.
Green bag waste is transported to a processing facility where the linens, towels and sheets are
cleaned and sterilized for reuse.
 [00041         With the advent of packaged sterile goods, the amount of solid medical waste
 generated has increased, particularly when the packaged sterile good takes the place of a
 reusable piece of equipment, tool, or accessory. The acceptance of packaged sterile goods and
 new medical technologies and procedures has increased the amount and bulk of materials
 entering the waste stream. This has also increased the chances of reusable medical equipment
 inadvertently entering the waste stream. Specifically, budgets for purchasing lost reusable
 equipment have increased over time due to the reusable equipment being lost or inadvertently
 thrown away. When certain high value medical equipment has come up missing, some
 hospitals have mandated that their workers do physical searches of bags of trash entering the
 waste stream with hopes to find the lost equipment. This solution is not practical, not
 desirable and also possesses risks to the workers assigned to find the equipment. One
 important risk involves the exposure of the worker to biologically contaminated waste when
 searching the "red bag" for inadvertently lost equipment.
 [0005]          Most reusable equipment, due to their service life expectations, is designed to
 contain durable materials with many of them containing metallic components. As a result,
 such equipment can be detected with appropriately designed metal detection systems. The
 metal detection system then alerts the worker that a metal-containing piece of equipment, tool,
 or accessory has been deposited in a waste bag.

[0006]                    Metal detection systems are available in many different forms and can be used
to assist a searcher in finding lost metallic items. Some systems employ a metal detector for
detecting metal after the waste bags have been filled with waste. The obvious shortcomings of
these systems include requiring workers to maneuver often heavy, full bags of trash. What's
more, if metal is detected, the worker must then rummage through a full bag of trash to
uncover the item. Many times the item found in the trash was a single use disposable
 manufactured with metallic components and therefore may have been correctly deposited in
 the bag after all. For instance, there are several single use disposable items with metallic
 components like motors or batteries that will be detected, Additionally, the bags are usually
 tied shut and are difficult to open making the worker's task even more difficult.
 [00071                    Further, it should be appreciated that biological materials can include
 contaminates and transmit infectious diseases. Accordingly, the individuals handling bags
 containing these materials run the risk of inadvertent exposure to these contaminates. Also, an
 appreciable fraction of these biological materials are in the liquid state. These fluids have
 been known to leak out of a bag during handling. Also. when in the liquid state. these
 biological materials, and their associated contaminates, have been known to become
 aerosolized. When this happens the surrounding environment can become contaminated
 which increases the risks of transmission to more persons other than those responsible for
 handling the baus. These hazards considerably increase when workers search for reusable
 equipment or other metallic items mixed in infectious or hazardous waste.
 [0008]                    Another proposed solution is metal detection at the point of disposal. Known
 waste carts typically include a barrel for holding the waste bags and a metal detector ring for
 placing on top of the barrel over the bag. In these systems. when a metal-containing object is
 discarded, an alarm is tripped requiring the user to look inside the bag for the metal-containing
 object. As previously described, this is less than desirable during a medical or surgical
 procedure. If the bag is partially or nearly full of medical waste, the metal-containing article
 may slip to the bottom of the waste bag when the worker shifts the medical waste in the bag
 looking for the metal-containing object. Additionally, sterile personnel performing medical
 procedure cannot search the contents of the waste containers without breaking sterility.

[0009]          Since the metal detector ring accumulates dust and biological materials due to
the medical detector ring being on top of the barrel and waste bag, the metal detector ring must
be cleaned between uses. Also, metal detection on these prior art systems is not tunable to
vary the amount of metallic content that triggers the alarm. Thus, with the increase in
disposable medical equipment, tools, and accessories, these prior art systems are unable to
selectively set alarm conditions and reduce false alarms,
[0010]          Securing waste bags to conventional waste carts is often cumbersome. Some
workers tie a knot in the top of the waste bag to reduce the size of the opening. The bag is
then stretched over a hoop of the waste cart to secure the bag to the waste cart. This method is
time consuming and not always predictable.
[0011]          U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/980.964, SYSTEM                 AND
METHOD FOR COMPACTING SOLID MEDICAL WASTE, filed 18 October 2007, and
PCT App. No. PCT/US2008/080170, filed. 16 October 2008, both of which are hereby
incorporated as reference, disclose one alternative system for collecting medical waste and,
during the collection process, determining if an article formed from metal is being
inadvertently discarded.
[0012]          However even the above system has disadvantages associated with its use.
These disadvantages are associated with how a bag is secured to the frame of the system of
PCT App. No. PCT/US2008/080710 and how this system informs medical/surgical personnel
that a metal item may have been inadvertently discarded.
[0001 2A]       The invention provides a portable cart for containing medical waste, the cart
including:
                a mobile base;
                a frame attached to the base that is located above the base, the frame having an
outer surface and opening;
                a bag tensioner arranged to engage a portion of a bag which is removably
mounted to the frame so as to be open within said opening, so that at least a portion of the bag
is placed in tension around a section of the outer surface of the frame.

[00012B]        In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the cart includes:
                a mobile base;
                a frame attached to said mobile base that is located above said mobile base, said
frame having an outer surface and an opening;
                a bag removably mounted to said frame so as to be open within the frame
opening wherein said bag has a peripheral section that defines an opening into said bag and
that extends over the outer surface of said frame; and
                a bag tensioner mounted to said frame., said bag tensioner including:
                      a first pin that is mounted to said frame that extends from the outer surface
                of said frame at a fixed location, said first pin mounted to said frame so that a
                first sub-section of the bag peripheral section can be disposed against said first
                pin: and
                      a catch moveably mounted to the outer surface of1said frame adjacent said
                first pin, said catch being shaped to receive a second sub-section of the bag
                peripheral section, wherein said catch is moveable relative to said first pin to
                 move between a bag tension position in which said first pin and said catch
                 cooperate to place the bag peripheral section in tension around the outer
                 surface of said frame and a bag load position in which said first pin and said
                 catch do not place the bag peripheral section in tension.
 [000 12C]       The invention also provides a portable cart fo collecting medical waste in a
 bag, the bag having an open end and a base opposite the open end. said cart including:
                 a mobile base;
                 a frame attached to said mobile base that is located above said mobile base,
 said frame configured to hold the bag to said frame so that the open end of the bag is adjacent
 to and accessible from said frame;
                 a loading station attached to said mobile base or said frame so as to be located
 adjacent the open end of the bag for receiving an object for disposal;
                 a sensor for detecting if the object for disposal contains metal, said sensor being
 located adjacent the loading station for determining if the objects on said loading station

contain metal; and
                a transfer mechanism located adjacent said loading station and the bag, said
transfer mechanism having at least one moveable component that, when actuated, transfers
objects on said loading station into the bag.
[0013]          Disclosures herein are directed to a new and useful system for holding solid
waste such as the waste generated during a medical/surgical procedure. The system includes a
mobile base that holds a bag for collecting waste. In some versions a frame, from which the
bag is suspended, contains a sensor assembly for detecting if metal objects are passed through
the open end of the bag. A processor monitors the signals emitted by the sensor. In the event
the sensor signals indicate an article with a substantial content of metal is placed in the bag,
the processor actuates both an audible alarm and a light. The audible alarm. is actuated only
for a short time. The light is actuated until the system is reset by the medical/surgical
personnel.
 [0014]         The system also includes a tensioner that holds the bag tight to the frame.
When it is desired to remove the bag, the tensioner is released.
 [0015]         In some versions, the cart has an escrow hold. The waste is placed in initially
placed in the escrow hold. Sensors around the escrow hold determine if the waste contains
metal. If there is no metal in the waste, the waste is automatically transferred to the bag.
 Alternatively, if sensors detect the presence of waste in the escrow hold, the alarms are
actuated. This provides the personnel the opportunity to remove any metal objects that may
have inadvertently placed in the system.

[0041]                 Referring to the Figures, wherein like numerals indicate like or corTesponding
parts throughout the several views, a solid medical waste collection system is generally shown
at 40 in FIG. 1. The system is particularly adapted for collecting solid medical waste during
medical or surgical procedures, but is not limited to this purpose. Such waste may include: (1)
conventional trash; (2) used linens, towels and sheets; (3) solid articles coated or exposed to
bodily fluids; (4) and radioactive waste.
[0042]                 Referring to FIG. 1, the system 40 comprises a cart 42 with a planar base 44.
Casters 46 are mounted to a bottom of the base 44 to provide the cart 42 with mobility. A
rectangular leg 48 extends upwardly from one side of the base 44. The leg 48 suspends an

open rectangular frame 50 above the base 44.
 [0043]                    The frame 50 is formed from plastic or other material that does not effect the
transmission of electromagnetic waves. The frame 50 comprises front 60 and rear 62 webs
 and front-to-rear extending lateral webs 64, 66 interconnecting the front 60 and rear 62 webs.
The front 60 and rear 62 webs of the frame 50 are longer than the associated front-to-rear
 extending lateral webs 64, 66.
 [0044]                    A plurality of corner blocks 52 project outwardly from outer surfaces of the
 frame 50. The blocks 52 act as retaining members that hold an open periphery 51 of a bag 54
 disposed in the frame 50. When the periphery 51 of the bag 54 is stretched and fbided over
 the frame 50 and the blocks 52, the periphery 51 is held under the blocks 52. The blocks 52
 protrude outwardly from corners of intersecting, adjacently connected webs 60, 62, 64, 66.
 [0045]                    The bag 54 is preferably formed from a plastic that creates an air-tight barrier.
 Plastics from which the bag 54 can be formed include polyethylene, polypropylene or nylon.
 The bag 54 is formed to have two opposed rectangular body panels 120. Bottom and side
 edges of the body panels 120 are sealed together.
 [00463                    In some embodiments, the base 44 includes a pressure sensitive transducer 55
 for determining a weight of the bag 54 as the bag 54 is filled with waste. This feature and a
 base incorporating this feature are described in the incorporated by reference U.S. Prov. App.
 No. 60/980,954 and PCT Pat. App. No. PCT/US2008/080170,
 [0047]                    Metal detection coils in some embodiments of this invention are arranged with
 detection coil 72 and null coil 73 that are together oppositely disposed to transmit coil 70.
 According to FIG. 1, these coils 70, 72, 73 can be disposed in either the front 60 and rear 62
 webs or the lateral webs 64, 66 given their opposing orientation. Collectively, coils 70, 72, 73
 function as an emitter and sensor assembly that detects when metal is placed through the
 opening formed by the webs and into the bag 54. Generally, it should be understood that the
 signal output by detection coil varies with the amount of metal that passes through frame 60
 into the open periphery 51 of bag 54. The above embodiment is different than traditional
 metal detection coil arrangements.

 [0048)               Traditional metal detection coil arrangements can also be implemented
cart with suitable geometry. One coil arrangiement, called a co-axial arrangement, typically
                                                                                         coaxial. In
 they are arranged in a shaped perimeter with the center axis of the perimeter being
 the co-axial arrangement, the coils are of similar outside size and shape, thus they are stacked
 in this co-axial arrangement. The stacked coils are typically arranged with the null coil 73 on
 top, the transmit coil 70 in the middle and the receive coil 72 on the bottom. These coils are
 wound in continuous loops with the loops taking a range of shapes like circle, square,
 rectangle. triangle or hexagonal. In the co-axial arrangement, objects to be detected pass
 through the inside perimeter of the loop shape. Another coil arrangement known in the art is
 called concentric coils. In the concentric coil arrangement, the coils typically align to the
  same axis, but the sizes of the coils arc different. In a typical concentric coil arrangement, the
 center loop coil is the null coil 73, the middle loop is the transmit coil 70 and the outer loop is
 the detection coil 72. These coils of different perimeter sizes are typically arranged in a planer
  fashion. This coil arrangement is useful when trying to detect metal that is passed either over
  or under the plane formed by the concentric perimeters. The perimeter of the concentric coils
  can also take a different shape like circles, squares, ovals, triangle, etc. with the most common
  being circular.
  [0049]              FIG. 2 is a block diagram of circuit components integral with the cart 42.
  These components include a processor 74. A signal generator 76 generates the AC signal that
  as. illustrated in Figure 2 is applied to both the transmit coil 70 and the null coil 73. The
  signal applied to null coil 73 is typically out of phase with the signal applied to the transmit
  coil so as to normally cancel out the signal output by the transmit coil 70. Thus, unless metal,
  which, when passing through the frame 50 disrupts both signals, ideally no signal is developed
  across detection coil 72.                 Cart 42 also has a display 78. In some embodiments an
  enunciator 75, e.g., an audible alarm, is integral with the display 78. In some embodiments of
  the invention, one or more separately actuated lights 79 are attached to the corners of the
  frame 50 and form part of the display 78.
  [0050]               In some embodiments, a light bar 85., seen in Figure 1, with a plurality of
  separately actuated light segments 87 indicates the strength of the signal generated by
  detection coil 72. While not shown, it should be understood that processor 74 regulates the

 actuation of the light segments 87. In some configurations of this invention, the number of
  light segments 87 processor 74 actuates is proportional to the amount of metal detected going
  as determined based on the analysis of the signal output by detection coil 72. Only one
  segment 87 is illuminated if signal analysis indicates only a small amount of metal is passed
  into the bag 54. Plural light segments may be illuminated if signal analysis indicates that there
  may have been a large amount of metal placed in the bag. This feature is useful to quickly
  review the relative metal content of the objects being discarded in the bag 54.
   [0051]          The user sets the threshold of detected metal at which the alarm should be
  asserted with a sensitivity selector 89. The selector 89 could be any number of different input
  types, potentiometer dial or knob with multiple settings, switch with two settings, etc. The
  state of the signal output by selector 89 is monitored by the processor 74 to determine thc
  user's desired setting. Based on this setting, processor 74 determines when the signal output
  by the detection coil reaches the level at which the alarms should be asserted. This threshold
  adjustment is useful to reduce nuisance alarms that may be due to foil packages or low metal
  content high volume single use disposable items.
   [0052]           In some embodiments, the threshold of metal detection can be set such that the
   audible alarm does not sound until the metal content signal is above a predetermined level.
   such as at a level that would illuminate all three segments 87 of the light bar 85. So, the light
   bar 85 shows the user the relative metal content, but only alarms when three segments are
   illuminated. When two or less segments 87 are illuminated, there is no audible alarm. The
  processor 74 may include a counter (not shown) that counts the number of objects that are
   discarded in each segment category, e.g., number of objects that illuminate one segment 87,
   two segments 87, etc. The processor 74 then stores the information for later reporting. The
   reporting can be used to adjust the system settings to minimize improper discarding of objects,
   while minimizing inconvenience to personnel. The illuminated light segments can be used as
   a gage for the users to determine what level to set the alarms. For example, if a reusable
   scalpel handle when passed by the metal detection coils illuminates two segments 87, the user
   can decide to set the alarms to detect the reusable scalpel handle.
   [0053]            A battery 80 powers the components internal to the cart 42. In most versions of

                                                - 12
the invention, the battery 80 comprises a set of rechargeable cells. Not illustrated is the
voltage regulators) that output signals at the potentials required by the power consuming
components integral with the cart 42. Also not illustrated are all the connections from the
battery 80 to which the power sourced by the battery 80 is applied. These rechargeable cells
can be charged with a built in charger, or alternately charged with an independent charger,
neither of the chargers are shown in the figures.
 [0054]          Also internal to the cart 42 is a receiver 82. The receiver 82 is connected to the
second coil 72 to convert the signals developed across the second coil 72 into a form in which
they can be processed by processor 74. The signal produced by transducer 55 is also applied
to processor 74 as in input signal. Not illustrated are any amplifiers needed to amplify the
 signal from the transducer 55 prior to application to the processor.
 [0055)          As described above, and in U.S. Provisional App. No. 60/980,954, coil 83
 may also foim part of the circuit internal to the cart 42. The coil 83 is a coil configured to
 receive energy that is inductively transmitted to the cart 42. As described above, the cart 42
 may incorporate features for trash compaction and may be periodically 1)laced in a compactor
 (not shown) that compresses the waste in the bag 54. When the cart 42 is so positioned, a
 current is sourced from the compactor to the cart 42 to recharge the batteries 80. An AC/DC
 circuit 84 is shown as being connected between coil 83 and the battery 80. The AC/DC
 circuit 84 converts the AC signal developed across coil 83 into a DC signal that charge the
 batteries 80.
 [0056]          Processor 74 monitors the signals output by the transducer 55 and coil 72. The
 processor 74 monitors the signal that develops across the coil 72 to determine if there is rapid
 change in the signal. FIG. 4 illustrates steps of metal detection and alarm. Step 110 of FIG. 4
 represents the continual monitoring of the signal from coil 72, the metal detect sensor.
 Step 111 represents the continual monitoring of a manually actuated alarm reset switch 126
 (Figure 4) the purpose of which is discussed below
  [0057]         Processor 74 compares the signal output by coil 72. the signal obtained in
 step 110, to a reference level. Again, the reference level is set based on the user- entered
 setting of sensitivity selector 89. Based on the comparison. represented by step 113. the

processor 74, determines whether or not the sensor has generated a signal indicating
metal has passed through the frame 50 into the bag 54. In some versions of the invention, the
                                                                                      over a period
sensor signal that is analyzed is an average signal. The average may be taken
                                                                                            signal to

reduce the likelihood that, due to noise in the sensor signal, processor incorrectly interprets
                                                                                         back from
change in signal strength as indicating the passing of metal in the bag 54. The loop
step 113 to step 110 indicates that steps 110, 111., 112 and 113 are continually executed.
 [0058]          If the analysis of step 113 indicates that the presents of metal has been detected,
in step 11 4 processor 74 actuates both the audio alarm and the light alarm. This means
enunciator 75 and lights 79 and/or 87 are actuated. After a set time, as represented by
 step 115., processor negates the assertion of the audio alarm. This period is typically under 10
 seconds and more typically less than 5 seconds. While the processor 74does turn off the
 enunciator 78, the processor does continue to assert the control signals that keep lights 79
 and/or 87 actuated.
 [0059]          Processor 74 does however, based on the monitoring of the alarm reset
 switch 126 of step Il1, in a step 116, evaluate whether or not the switch 126 is actuated.
 Upon determining that the switch 126 has been actuated, in step 117, the processor 74 asserts
 the signals the result in the turning off of the lights 79 and/or 87, the negation of the light
 alarm.
 [0060]          Figure 3 illustrates steps of weight detection and alarm. The signal output by
 transducer 55 is related to the weight of the waste contained in the bag 54. When the cart 42 is
 in use, the processor 74 continually monitors the transducer output signal, as illustrated by
 step 102. As descry bed above, the processor also continues to monitor whether or the alarm
 switch 126 is actuated. in Figure 3 called out as step 103. Processor 74 compares this signal
 received from transducer 55 to a reference signal level representative of a preferred maximum
 weight for the bag 54 and its contents, step 104. In the event the comparison in step 104
 shows that the bag is not yet full. the above- described monitoring continues.
  [0061)          At times health care workers would be applying external loads that could be
  registered by the weight transducer 55. For example they could step on the lower platform or

     |E i                 r '2.E1dA" 4-VQ
          xncem'KtPabliDCC'GVU

be manually compacting the waste in order to get more waste into the bag. To prevent false
alarms for this condition, the processor 74 could, in step 104, look for 2 or more subsequent
signals from the transducer 55 that indicate the max weight has been exceeded. Only if this
event occurs does the processor 74 recognize the cart as being in a state in which bag 54
contains weight at or above the preferred maximum level.
[0062]                 If the comparison of step 104 indicates that the bag 54 and its contents are
above the preferred maximum weight. processor 74, in step 106, asserts an alarm. As with
metal detection, the enunciator 75 asserts both the audio and light alarms, step 105. The audio
alarm is deactivated after a short time, step 106. The light alarm, the continued actuation of
lights 79 and/or 87 continues until it is determined in step 107, alarm reset switch 126 has
been set. At that time, in step 108, the light alarm is negated.
[00631                 Referring back to FIG. 1, the cart 42 of the system 40 is prepared for use by
fitting the bag 54 to the cart 42. Immediately prior to the medical or surgical procedure to be
performed, the cart 42 is activated. This activation means that the signal generator 76 is
activated by control switch 124 and the processor 74 actively monitors the signal across
coil 72 and the pressure sensed by transducer 55. During the medical/surgical procedure,
waste is placed in the bag 54 in a conventional manner.
[0064]                 The assertions of both the audible and light alarms of step 114 provide the
medical/surgical personnel with the notice that metal has entered the bag 54. The alarm serves
as a cue so that these personnel can verify that the object discarded was not a reusable object
that was inadvertently discarded. If the investigation indicates the object was inadvertently
discarded, it can then be promptly retrieved before additional waste is piled on top of it.
[0065]                  Alarm reset switch 126 can be a foot pedal movably mounted to the base 44 of
the cart 42. By using the foot pedal, the user does not need to break sterility during the
medical or surgical procedure to shut off the alarm. Alternately, an additional shut off switch
can be added to this embodiment. The additional shut-off switch can be located in the top
structure of the cart 42 on the opposite side of switch 126. On the outside of front web 60 for
example.         This position allows the non-sterile circulator in the operating room a more
convenient location to control the alarm particularly when the foot switch 126 is facing the

                                            - 15
sterile surgical field.
[0066]           Embodiments described herein describe metal detection working at the point of
                                                                                           time
disposal.    During use, these point of disposal metal detection systems offer real
information that benefits the ability of someone to discover if reusable medical equipment is
inadvertently discarded. As mentioned. there are single use disposable instruments that do
contain metal, yet should be discarded after use. These point of disposal systems provide this
real time information and allow the user to compare the real time information pro vided to their
expectation as to what should happen when disposing of waste. For example, a small reusable
electric power tool used in surgery is clamped on a disposable surgical drape and the drape is
gathered tip into a bunch containing the power tool and the bunch is subsequently disposed
 into the appropriate container. The point of disposal metal detection system will alarm
 indicating to the medical worker that there is a metallic content in that bunch. Since the
worker's expectation was they were disposing of only a bunched up surgical drape, the alarms
 going off did not meet the expectation of the worker and alerted them to investigate. The
 information provided in conjunction with the timing of that information allowed that worker to
 efficiently recover and prevent inadvertently discarding a valuable piece of reusable
 equipment. In another example, the worker is discarding a single use battery powered
 irrigation system containing a metallic motor. When the worker discards the irrigation system,
 their expectation was that the alarms would be set off by the metal detection system. Since the
 alarms met their expectation, they could simply reset the alarms without having the need to
 investigate or dig through the waste container.
 [0067]          Alarms described in these embodiments can be controlled by the processor in
 different configurations and sequences. For example., the metal detection system could be
 configured with only a visual or only an audible alarm. Visual alarms can be in the form of
 the light 79 or set of lights 79. The audible alarms can be in the form of the enunciator 75
 which can be formed from a piezo-electric buzzer or a more elaborate speaker (not shown). In
 one preferred embodiment, the metal detection system could be configured with both an
 audible and visual alarm. These alarms can be mechanized to provide the important alerting
 function while minimizing the distraction they cause. For example, when the metal detection
 system processes the signal and determines it is appropriate to alarm, both audible and visual

                                             - 16
alarms could be fired. In this example, the audible alarm could sound for a finite time, say 1
second, and then automatically turn off. The lights could stay on until a worker investigates
the waste and then actuates the alarm reset switch 126 or other shut-off switch. This
mechanization of alarming allows the worker to continue performing some other critical work,
like performing a medical procedure., without forgetting to investigate the waste for metallic
equipment until there is a more convenient time for that investigation.
 [0068]          During the course of the procedure, the contents of the bag 54 increase in
weight and volume. The processor 74. per the steps of Figure 3, also monitors the weight of
the bag 54. If the bag starts to become excessively weighted down. the assertions of the
alarms provide notice that it may be appropriate to replace or empty the bag.
 [0069]          Eventually, there is a point in the procedure at which bag 54 is ready for
 closure. For a particular bag this may be because, as a result of the execution of step 104 it is
 determined that the bag 54 is full. Alternatively, it may be that the actual medical/surgical
procedure is complete and the bag 54, while not full, is ready for short-term storage and
transport.
 [0070]          Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6. one embodiment of the cart 42 is shown with a pre
 detection apparatus for detecting metal-containing objects in batches before being dumped in
 the bag 54. These batches contain a volume of waste that is only a portion of the entire
 volume of waste ultimately discarded in the bag 54. Without the pre- detection apparatus,
 when metal-containing objects are detected by the system 40, the user must sort through
 existing waste already deposited in the bag 54 to find the objects. By detecting the waste in
 batches, i.e., batch processing, the amount of waste that requires inspection to find the metal
 containing objects is much smaller, making it easier to sort through and reducing exposure to
 harmful contaminates, offensive odors, broken glass, etc.
 [0071]           The pre-detection apparatus of FIG. 5 includes a hopper 200 rotatably
 connected to the frame 50.         Hopper 200 includes a support platform 202, a pair of
 sidewalls 204 extending upwardly from the support platform 202., and a rear wall 203
 extending upwardly from the support platform 202. The rear wall 203 interconnects the
 sidewalls 204 to form a temporary storage space 205 for each batch of waste to be processed.

A pair of hinges 206 pivotally connects the platform 202 to the frame
pivots about the hinges 206 between a load position and a dump position. The user grasps a
handle 208 on the hopper 200 to move the hopper 200. An arn 210 extends perpendicularly
in a cantilevered fashion from the leg 48 to support the hopper 200 and each batch load.
[0072)          In this embodiment, a second pressure-sensitive transducer 212 is disposed on
the arm 210 to determine the weight of each batch of waste. This information can be used to
develop a metal content-to-weight ratio or factor. Accordingly, the alarm could he based on
this factor. For instance, the segments 87 on the light bar 85 could be selectively illuminated
based on this factor being above a predetermine level.
[0073]          In this embodiment, the coils 70, 72, 73 are disposed in the sidewalls 204 to
detect any metal that may be present in each batch. Of course, any of the metal detection
arrangements previously described could be utilized, such as the concentric coil arrangement,
which could be placed in the platform 202. It should also be appreciated that any metal
detection arrangement could be employed with any of the pre-detection features described
herein.
[0074]          During use, objects intended for disposal in the bag 256 are first placed on the
support platform 202 of the hopper 200. Support platform 202 thus functions as a loading
station for the waste.     Metal detection continues while each object is loaded into the
hopper 200. When metal is detected, the alarm is actuated as previously described including
the audible alarm, visual alarm, or both. By using the hopper 200, the worker has less waste to
sift through when metal is detected. Likewise, the batch load has a relatively small depth such
that the user can often visually inspect the waste when the alarm is actuated to find the metal
containing object that tripped the alarm. Once the user is satisfied that any waste in the
hopper 200 is to be discarded, the user grabs the handle 208 and moves the hopper to the
dump position to dump the batch in the bag 54.
 [0075]          Referring to FIGS. S and 7, a separate disposable covering 212 protects the
hopper from being soiled by the waste. The covering 212 defines a sleeve that slips down
over the rear wall 203 and sidewalls 204 of the hopper 200. The sleeve includes a plurality of
panels 214 sealed together to form an air-tight barrier that closely follows the shape of the

hopper 200. FIG. 8 shows a bag 216 with an alternative protective
hopper 200 integrated with the bag 54 previously described.
[0076            Referring to FIG. 9, in another embodiment, the pre-fil assembly includes a
                                                                                         connects the
platform 300 pivotally connected to the frame 50. A pair of hinges 302 pivotally
platform 300 to the frame 50. The platform                300 is movable between a stowed position in
which the platform folds down to reduce the overall footprint of the cart 342 and a load
position (shown. in FIG. 9).
 [0077]          A disposable tray 304 (or reusable tray with protective covering) is disposed on
the platform 300 when in the load position for receiving waste intended for depositing in the
 bag 54. Platform 300 functions as the loading station.
 [0078]          A detector frame 306 slides along the platform 300 either manually or
 automatically to scan the tray 304 when full to determine if any metal-containing objects not
 to be discarded are present.                  The detector frame 306 includes four interconnected
 members 308, 310, 312, 314 including opposing top 308 and bottom 310 members and
 opposing left 312 and right 314 side members. The side members 312, 3 14 are notched to
 slidably receive the platform 300. The coils 70, 72, 73 are disposed in the side members 312,
 314 to detect any metal-containing objects.
 [0079]          In embodiments in which scanning is automatic, the platform 300 includes a
 second pressure-sensitive transducer 316 to determine the weight of the batch of waste on the
 tray 304. When the batch reaches a predetermined weight or metal content-to-weight factor,
 the detector frame 306 moves across the tray to detect any metal-containing objects.
 [0080]          A drive assembly 318 moves the detector frame. The drive assembly 318
 includes a motor 320 and a drive screw 322. The drive assembly 3 18 further includes a drive
 nut 324 fixed to the bottom member 310 to receive the drive screw 322. Preferably, the
 processor 74 actuates the motor 320 upon the batch reaching the predetermined weight or
 factor. Alternatively, the processor actuates the motor 320 periodically to scan the batch with
 the drive assembly 3 18 re-setting the detector frame 306 to the start position (See FIG. 9) at
 the end of each scan,                  The motor 320 could also be push-button controlled in manual

                                              - 19
embodiments. A manual wand metal detector 326 could also be used to scan the batch of
waste before dumping in the bag 54.
[0081]          ina similar embodiment shown in FIG. 10, a detector frame 330 is fixed to the
platform 300 of the cart 42 and the user passes the tray 304 through the detector frame 330
prior to disposal. When the user is satisfied that the detected objects were not inadvertently
discarded, the user manually dumps the tray in the bag 54.
[0082]          Referring to FIG. I 1-1 3, another embodiment of the pre-detection apparatus is
shown. In this embodiment, a bag-constraining device 400 chokes the bag 54 just below the
frame 50 to create a batch volume in the bag 54. The bag- constraining device 400 comprises
an elastic band 402 placed over the bag 54 at the desired position. In its normal state, the
elasLic band 402 chokes the bag 54 to prevent the transfer of waste from above the band to
below the band until each batch is processed. Typically, the batch volume is sized such that
two to ten batches are processed for each bag 54.
 10083]         The bag-constraining device 400 further comprises a plurality of non-metal
loops 404 completely encircling the band 402. A flexible, non-elastic cable 406 extends from
each of the loops 404 and is connected to the loops 404 with hooks 408 or VelcroTM or other
releasable connector. A plurality of motor/pulley assemblies 410 operate to wind each of the
cables 406 on pulleys 412 (see FIG. 13). When winding the cables 406 on the pulleys 412, the
elastic band 402 is pulled at four equidistant positions around the band 402 to expand the
band 402 and unconstrain the bag 54 to release the batch contents.
 [0084]         During operation, the upper portion of the bag 54 when in the constrained state
functions as the loading station in which the material intended for disposal is initially
deposited.    The height of the material in this loading station is monitored by an optical
sensor 414 mounted in one of the webs 60, 62, 64, 66. This material height measurement is
serves as an approximation of the volume of waste at the station. Once the height of the waste
reaches the optical sensor, the processor 74 determines the cumulative content of the metal
 sensed in the batch of material at the loading station. If the calculated metal content is within
an acceptable limit, processor 74 allows the material to fall into the bottom section of the
bag 54. Processor 74 allows this event to occur by actuating the motor/pulley assemblies 410

motor/pulley assemblies 410 reverse direction and the elastic band 402 is allowed to re-choke
the bag 54 in preparation for a new batch of waste. It should be appreciated that a manual
push-button control could also be used to actuate the motor/pulley assemblies 410. Coils 70,
72, 73 are disposed in the frame 50 to detect metal in each batch and actuate the alarm as
previously described.
 [0085)                    The bags 54 can be assembled and provided to the facility in which the
procedure is being performed with the band 402 and loops 404 already attached to the bags 54
so that the user has only to connect or disconnect the books 408 to the band 402 when
replacing bags 54, With the band 402, a smaller ibotprint is provided to take up less floor
space than other embodiments of the invention..
 [0086]                    Referring to FIGS. 14-16, another embodiment is shown with a different bag
constraining device 500. H ere, the band 402 is replaced with a pair of pinch bars 502 to create
the batch volume in the bag 54. A pair of motors 504 are mounted to an underside 506 of
corners of frame 550. Each motor 504 operates one of the pinch bars 502 to close and pinch
the bag 54just below the frame 550. Coils 70, 72. 73 are disposed in the frame 550 to detect
metal. A second pressure transducer 510 is disposed on one of the pinch bars 502 to detect the
batch weight. The processor 74 assesses the weight and the metal content ofthe batch, and if
acceptable, the pinch bars 502 are moved automatically to release the batch into the lower
portion of the bag 54.
 [0087]                    In this embodiment, the frame 550 is modified by removing the front web 60
and corner blocks 52. Instead, the frame 550 of FIGS. 14-16 includes only a rear web 562 and
side webs 564, 566. The lights 79 are mounted to the end of the side webs 564, 566 and on a
display board 5 18. FIG. 15 shows a bag 520 configured to fit onto the cart 542 shown in
FIG. 14. Like the bag 54 of FIG. 1, bag 520 is formed of two main rectangular panels 522
sealed together at their bottom and side edges. The bag 520 further includes a pair of sleeve
panels 524 sealed at their top and bottom edges to the outside of the main panels 522 at the top
of each of the main panels 522 and just below the top of each of the main panels 522 to define
sleeves for sliding onto the side webs 564, 566. The sleeves protect the side webs 564, 566

                                                -21
from dust and debris during use.
[0088]            FIG. 16 shows another bag with a second pair of sleeve panels 530 sealed to the
outside of the main panels 522 to define sleeves for sliding onto the pinch bars 502. The
second pair of sleeve panels 530 are also sealed along their top and bottom edges across each
of the main panels 522. The sleeve panels 524, 530 have a length equal to a width of the main
panels 522 such that the top and bottom edges of the sleeve panels 524. 530 are sealed
completely across the main panels 522, while the side edges of the sleeve panels 524, 530
remain unsealed to provide the sleeves for slipping on the side webs 564, 566 and pinch
bars 502.
 [0089]           In the versions of the invention illustrated with respect to Figures 14-16, as with
the versions of the invention illustrated in Figures 11-13, the top of the bag, when in the
 constrained state, functions as the loading station on which the material deposited for disposal
 is initially placed.
 [0090]           Referring to FIG. 17, another version of a bag- constraining device 600 is
 shown. In this embodiment, the bag-constraining device 600 includes a pair of doors 602
 pivotally mounted to the side webs 564. 566. The doors 602 are moveable between dump
 positions and load positions. Each door 602 is generally planar to form a bottom of the
 frame 50 when in the load position. A pair of motors 604 are mounted to an underside of the
 rear corners of the frame 50. Each motor 604 rotates one of the doors 602 between the dump
 position and the load position. In the load position, the doors 602 close an opening through
 the frame 50 and pinch the bag 54 therebetween. After a new bag 54 is placed on the cart 642,
 the motors 604 automatically or manually move the doors 602 to the load position.
 [0091]           Once in the load position, the cart 642 is ready for batch loading. Coils 70, 72,
 73 are disposed in the frame 50 to detect metal. A second pressure transducer 610 is disposed
 on one of the doors 602 to detect the batch weight. The doors 602 are moved automatically
 upon the batch reaching a predetermined weight or metal content-to- weight factor. The batch
 loading, alarming and dumping processes proceed in this embodiment as described in the
 previous embodiments including both manual and automatic operations.

[0092]                FIGS. 18-20 show another embodiment of a bag- constraining device
this embodiment, the bag- constraining device 700 pinches the bag 54just below the frame 50
and heat seals the bag 54 at this location to create a batch volume for the waste of only a
portion of the total volume of the bag 54. Preferably, two to ten hatches are processed in each
bag 54.
 [0093]               Refeiring specifically to FIG. 19, the bag- constraining device 700 includes a
pair of pinch bar assemblies 702 for pinching the bag 54just below the frame 750. Each pinch
 bar assembly 702 includes a horizontal member 706 and a vertical member 708 extending
 downwardly from the horizontal member 706. A rectangular key 710 is disposed on each
 opposing end of the horizontal member 706 and extends upwardly from each end through an
 elongated slot 712 in the underside of the front 760 and rear 762 webs. A nut 714 is fixed to
 each of the keys 710. A drive screw 716 is mounted in each of the front 760 and rear 762
 webs to drive the nuts 714 while the keys 710 in the slots 712 prevent the nuts 714 from
 rotating. rhe nuts 714 travel along the drive screw 716 to move the pinch bar assemblies 702
 from the dump position to the load position. The drive screw 716 can be configured such that
 one half of the drive screw 716 has threads in one direction and one half with threads in an
 opposite direction. As a result, the same drive screw 716 can move the nuts 714 of the pinch
 bar assemblies 702 toward one another when the drive screw 716 is rotated in one direction
 and away from one another when rotation is reversed.
 [0094]               Referring to FIG. 20, the base 744 of the cart 742 includes a movable
 platform 718 for supporting the bag 54 and its contents. A pair of drive assemblies 720 move
 the movable platform 718 upwardly along two rectangular legs 748. Each drive assembly 720
 includes a motor 724 mounted to the base 744 and a drive screw 726 rotatably supported in
 each of the legs 722. The movable platform 718 includes a pair of drive nuts 728 fixed to and
 extending from opposing sides of the movable platform 718. Keys 730 connect the nuts 728
 to the movable platform 718. The keys 730 are inserted into elongated slots 732 in the
 legs 748 to travel along the slots 732 during adjustment that is similar to the pinch bar
 assemblies 702.
 [0095]               When a bag 54 is first placed on the cart 742, the pinch bar assemblies 702 are

                                              - 23
moved to the load position to constrain the bag 54 below the frame 750 and the movable
platform 718 is raised to a positions ust beneath the pinch bar assemblies 702. When the pinch
bars 702 close, the opposed sections of the bag above the pinch bars is become a loading
station. Material for disposal is placed on these sections of the bag 54. The coils 70, 72, 73
may be disposed in side webs 64, 66 as previously described, or the coils 70, 72, 73 may be
disposed in the horizontal members 706 of the pinch bar assemblies 702. Metal detection and
alarms occur as previously described in this embodiment.
[0096]          Once the initial batch of waste is processed, the pinch bar assemblies 702 either
manually or automatically move from the load position to the dump position. The movable
platform 718 then supports the batch load and is lowered until the pinch bar assemblies 702
are disposed above the batch load.
[0097)          Heat-sealing coils 734, 736 are disposed in the vertical members 708 of the
pinch bar assemblies 702. The vertical members 708 come together in the load position for
the second batch of waste and the processor 74 then actuates the heat-scaling coils 734, 736 to
create a seal at a pinched section of the bag 54 above the initial batch load.
 [0098]         Thus., the bag 54 is sealed above and below the batch load to contain fluids and
reduce odors from emanating out of the bag 54. In this embodiment, the initial batch load is
stored at a bottom of the bag 54 and the bag 54 is heat sealed above the batch load.
Subsequent batches are stored on top of the last. The movable platform 718 may include the
transducer 55 so that the processor 74 can determine an overall weight of the bag 54.
Alternatively, a second transducer 755 on one of the pinch bar assemblies 702 may be used to
determine batch weights and total weight by adding individual batch weights. The second
transducer 755 can also be used for determining, by the processor 74, when each batch is
 finished processing using weight or factor values.
 [0099]          In other embodiments, heat sealing could be replaced by batch separators that
 are either manually or automatically placed in the bag 54 to separate batch loads, e.g.,
 cardboard inserts (not shown), or the bags 54 could be configured with integral flaps (not
 shown) that fall into place over each batch after each batch is processed.

  01001         Referring to FIG. 21, an assembly 840 similar to that shown in FIG. 10 is
shown with a conveyor belt 800 spaced away from the open end of the bag 54. Conveyor
belt 800 thus functions as the loading station on which the material for disposal is placed. A
frame 802 with metal detecting sensors is located over the conveyor belt 802. A motor 804
and motor-driven roller 806 drives the conveyor belt 800 around a second roller 808. The
material deposited for disposal initially passes across the metal-detecting sensors located in
frame 802. From frame 802, conveyor belt 800 transfers the material into the open end of the
bag 54. If, however, the sensors assert signals indicating the potential presence of the metal,
the processor controlling assembly 840 asserts one or more alarms to provide notice of the
possibility of an object in the waste stream that should not be disposed. The processor also
deactivates the motor 804 so as to stop the object from being dumped into the bag. This gives
personnel the opportunity to inspect the object to determine whether or not the object should
be disposed. This embodiment could also include doors (not shown) to open and close access
to the bag 54. in this embodiment, waste is placed on the conveyor belt which closely
simulates the process of throwing trash directly into a bag. This embodiment closely matches
what is traditionally done in medical facilities today, namely discard trash at the point of
generation and therefore causes minimal disruption to the medical procedure.
[0101]           Referring to FIGS. I and 22, a bag-tensioning mechanism 900 is shown. The
bag-tensioning mechanism 900 comprises a knob 902 rotatably mounted to and supported in
one of the side webs 64. 66. The knob 902 includes a base plate 904 in rotating abutment with
an outer side face 906 of, arbitrarily, side web 64. An outer grasping head 908 is spaced from
the base plate 904 by a shaft 910. A bag catch 9 [2 is mounted to the base plate 904 and
extends outwardly therefrom for catching a portion of the periphery 51 of the bag 54. The bag
catch 912 is preferably a pin 912. The pin 912 may also include an enlarged head spaced from
the base plate 904 in order to retain the periphery 51 of the bag 54 to the bag catch 912.
[0102]           Referring specifically to FIG. 22, inside a hollow space of the side web 64, the
knob 902 includes a ratchet plate 916. The ratchet plate 916 is spring loaded by a spring 918
so that as the ratchet plate 916 is rotated, the spring tension force increases. A spring-biased
pawl member 920 ratchets along notches in the ratchet plate 916 to hold the ratchet plate 916
against the spring tension force and the external forces generated from the bag periphery 51

                                                 -25
                                                                                             and
tension. A release push button 922 is arranged to lift the pawl member 920 when pressed
release the ratchet plate 916. When this occurs, the ratchet plate 916 and knob 902 rotate back
to their initial position under the spring tension force placed on the ratchet plate 916 and
knob 902 by the spring 918.
[0103]           In use, the bag 54 is first arranged over the corner blocks 52. A portion of the
periphery 51 of the bag 54 is routed around the shaft 910 and wrapped or hooked about the
bag catch 912. The top 2.5 to 5 cm of the bag periphery 51 it typically the same amount
arranged below the corner blocks 52, is wrapped about the bag catch 912. The user rotates the
knob 902 by grasping the grasping head 908 of the knob 902 to twist the periphery 51 of the
 bag 54 and tension the periphery 51 of the bag 54. This tension secures the bag 54 by
 increasing the friction between the bag 54 and the frame 50 as well as increasing the hoop
tension below the corner blocks 52 thus workinE in combination with the corner blocks 52 to
 secure the bag periphery 51 around the outside of the side webs. Dislocating the bag from this
tensioned position requires the bag 54 to stretch over the corner blocks 52. To release the
 bag 54, the user presses the release button 922. The release button 922 allows the bag 54 to
 become untwisted relieving the tension on the periphery 51 of the bag 54. The knob 902
 automatically returns to its home position, via the spring 918 and lie user can then pull the
 bag 54 off the bag catch 912 and uncoil the twisted bag 54 from the shall 910 of the
 bag-tensioning mechanism 900. The bag-tensioning mechanism 900 is now ready for a. new
 bag 54.
 [0104]          Referring to FIG. 23, an alternative bag- tensioning mechanism 1000 is shown.
 In this embodiment, two routing posts 1002 with enlarged heads 1004 are mounted to one of
 the side webs 64. 66. A spring-loaded sliding pin 1006 with enlarged head 1008 acts to
 tension the periphery 51 of the bag 54.          The pin 1006 is slidably mounted through an
 elongated slot 1010 in a housing 1012 mounted to an underside of the side web 64. A
 spring 1014 is mounted to the pin 1006 at one end and to the housing 1012 at an opposite end.
 The user first positions the sliding pin 1006 to a load position by overcoming the spring
 tension (as shown in FIG. 23). The periphery 5 1 of the bag 54 is routed between the routing
 posts 1002 and over the enlarged head 1008 of the sliding pin 1006. The user then releases the
 sliding pin 1006 and the periphery 51 of the bag 54 is tensioned holding it onto the corner

blocks 52 with increased friction and hoop tension as described earlier. To release the bag 54,
the user re-positions the sliding pin 1006 into the load position and unhooks the bag 54 from
the sliding pin 1006. The enlarged heads of routing posts 1002, 1004 and pin 1006 serve to
keep the periphery 51 of bag 54 from slipping axially off of those components.
  [0105]                   Referring to FIGS. 24A, 24B and 25, another alternative bag-tensioning
  mechanism 1100 is shown. Here, two routing posts 1102 with enlarged heads 1104 are
  mounted to one of the side webs 64, 66. A pair of mounting brackets 1112 are fixed to the
  side web 64. A pair of rubber gripping pads 1106 are mounted to the brackets 1112 beneath
  the routing posts 1102. The pads 1106 are fixed at one end to the brackets I11. 2 and extend to
  a cantilevered end such that the cantilevered ends of the pads 1106 abut one another. The
  periphery 51 of the bag 54 is routed between the routing posts 1102 and between the
  cantilevered ends of the pads 1106. The pads 1106 flex downwardly as a portion of the
  periphery 5 I of the bag 54 is pulled between the pads 1106. Once enough tension is placed on
  the bag 54 to hold the periphery 51 to the frame 50, the user ceases pulling the bag 51 through
  the pads 1106. The pads 1106 then release toward their normal position horizontally opposed
  to one another and pinch the bag 54 between the pads 1106 to hold the bag 54 in place as
  shown in FIG. 24B. The pads 1106 and brackets serve as a one-way holding mechanism to
  maintain the periphery 51 tension applied by the user. To release the bag periphery 51, the
  user pulls the bag horizontally, parallel to the pads 1106 edges until the bag periphery 51 if
  clear of the pads 1106.
  [0106]                   In the variation shown in FIG. 25, springs I110 extend from projections 114
  fixed to the web 64.                    The springs 1110 movably connect the brackets 1112 to the
  projections 1114. The springs 1110 urge the pads 1106 upwardly as the user pulls the bag
  through the pads 1106 downwardly to facilitate mounting of the bag 54.
  [0107]                   FIG. 26 shows another bag-tensioning mechanism 1200. In this embodiment,
  two swing arms 1202 are pivotally mounted to the rear web 62 of the frame 50. Torsion
  springs 1204 are positioned about pins 1206 pivotally mounting the swing arms 1202 to the
  rear web 62. The swing arms 1202 are L-shaped. In use, the periphery 51 of the bag 54 is
  rolled over the frame 50 and the swing arms 1202 with the swing arms 1202 held against the

rear web 62 and against the spring bias of the coil springs 1204. The swing arms 1202 are
then released to provide tension on the periphery 51 of the bag 54. To remove the bag 54, the
swing arms 1202 are again held against the frame 50 and the bag 54 is removed from the
frame 50 and swing arms 1202.
 [0108]               In other versions of the invention not shown, a supplemental identification
system could be used in combination with metal detection to prevent re-usable objects from
being discarded, or to prevent objects from being discarded in the wrong bag. Referring to
 FlG. 1, the identification system includes RFIDs 90 (see sample object being discarded)
placed on all objects used during the course of a medical or surgical procedure. A reader 88
 mounted to the frame senses the RFIDs as they pass by the reader 88 while discarded. In FIG.
 1, the reader 88 is mounted to the rear web 62 and an object with RFID 90 is shown passing
 the reader 88. The reader 88 sends corresponding signals to the processor 74 when each RFID
 is sensed. The processor 74 then looks up the RFID in look-up tables to determine if the
 object is to be discarded or if it is reusable. If it is not to be discarded, the alarm is actuated.
 A different alarm could be used to clearly indicate that the object was incorrectly discarded.
 [0109]               The processor 74 could also be wirelessly connected to a central inventory
 control system (not shown) to monitor inventory and order equipment, tools, accessories, etc.
 as the objects are discarded. At least two acceptable modes of wirelessly transmitting data
 from the processor to the inventory control system are Infrared or Radio frequency. In one
 example, the packaging materials of a single use disposable product can contain the RFIDs
 and the reader 88 transmits the signal to the central inventory control system indicating the
 package has been opened and needs replacement.
 [0110]               RFID information and other metal detection information can be wirelessly
 transmitted to other management systems that may benefit from such information.
 [0111]               During the course of a procedure the waste is deposited in the corresponding
 bags 54 (e,g., white, red, green, yellow, etc.) secured to separate carts 42. The carts 42 are
 typically positioned in the operating room or other space in which waste are generated. A
 circulating nurse, or other individual that receives the waste from the person depositing it, is
 responsible for initially categorizing the waste and placing it in the appropriate cart 42. When

                                                 - 28
a bag 54 containing either conventional waste, red bag waste, green waste or radioactive waste
is at or near capacity, it is sealed. At that time, the bag 54 is transported to a loading dock for
eventual transport to a waste processing facility.
[0112]           Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention are
possible in light of the above description. Thus the features of the different embodiments of
this invention may be combined. Also, not all features in each embodiment of the invention
may be necessary to provide the advantages and benefits of the described embodiments.
Similarly, the shapes of the components may be different from what has been described. For
example, while the frame from which the bag is suspended is generally shown as rectangular;
it need not always have this shape. In some versions of the invention the frane may be
circular or oval. In not all versions of the invention is it necessary to have a null coil as part of
the metal detection assembly. Likewise other means than the disruption of magnetic fields
may be used to sense whether or not there is metal in the object being subjected to disposal.
