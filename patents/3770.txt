   TECHNICAL FIELD
10         The technical field relates to certain (2S)-N-[(1S)-1-cyano-2-phenylethyl]-1,4
   oxazepane-2-carboxamide compounds (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof)
   that inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP 1; EC 3.4.14.1) activity, to their utility in treating
   and/or preventing clinical conditions including respiratory diseases, such as asthma and
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), to their use in therapy, to pharmaceutical
15 compositions containing them and to processes for preparing such compounds.
   BACKGROUND
           Dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1; EC 3.4.14.1), also known as cathepsin C, is a
   lysosomal cysteine protease belonging to the papain family having a molecular weight of 200
20 kDa. DPP1 was first discovered by Gutman and Fruton in 1948 (JBiol Chem, 174, 851-858);
   however, the cDNA of the human enzyme was first described in 1995 (Paris et al. 1995, FEBS
   Lett, 369, 326-330). DPP1 is the only member of the papain family that is functional as a
   tetramer, consisting of four identical subunits. Each subunit is composed of an N-terminal
   fragment, a heavy chain and a light chain (Dolenc et al. 1995, JBiol Chem, 270, 2162620
25 21631).
           DPP 1 is constitutively expressed in many tissues with highest levels in lung, kidney,
   liver and spleen. DPP 1 catalyses the removal of dipeptides from the N-terminal end of
   polypeptide substrates with broad specificity. Recent data suggest that besides being an
   important enzyme in lysosomal protein degradation, DPP1 also functions as a key enzyme in
30 the activation of granule serine proteases in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells
   (granzymes A and B), mast cells (chymase and tryptase) and neutrophils (cathepsin G,
   neutrophil elastase and proteinase-3).

                                                   la
          Mast cells are found in many tissues but are present in greater numbers along the
  epithelial linings of the body, such as the skin, respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. In
  humans, two types of mast cells have been identified. The T-type, which expresses only
  tryptase, and the MC-type, which expresses both tryptase and chymase. In humans, the T-type
5 mast cells are located primarily in alveolar tissue and intestinal mucosa while the TC-type

     WO 2015/110826                                                              PCT/GB2015/050155
                                                    2
   cells predominate in skin and conjunctiva. Tryptase and chymase appear to be important
   mediators of allergic diseases, being involved in processes of inflammation,
   bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion.
           Neutrophils play a critical role in host defence against invading pathogens.
 5 Neutrophils are produced in the bone marrow and are fully mature when released into the
   circulation to take up their role as the first line of cellular defence. Pro-inflammatory
   mediators and chemotactic attractants activate neutrophils and draw them to the site of
   infection, where they act to engulf bacteria by phagocytosis, assaulting them with an arsenal
   of anti-bacterial compounds that use both oxidative and non-oxidative methods of attack. The
io powerful serine protease, neutrophil elastase, is one of those anti-bacterial compounds that are
   clearly involved in destroying bacteria. Neutrophil elastase is released into the phagolysome
   surrounding the microorganism, which it proceeds to destroy. Neutrophil elastase is able to
   attack the outer membrane protein, OmpA, in gram-negative bacteria, helping to directly kill
   the pathogen by degrading its membrane, as well as enabling other anti-bacterial compounds
15 to gain access to the pathogen. In addition, neutrophil elastase may help process other anti
   bacterial compounds, converting them from inactive pro-peptides into their active states, such
   as for cathelicidin.
           Yet neutrophil elastase can also cause problems for its host. It is one of the most
   destructive enzymes in the body, with the capability of degrading extracellular matrix proteins
20 (including collagens, proteoglycan, fibronectin, platelet receptors, complement receptor,
   thrombomodulin, lung surfactant and cadherins) and key plasma proteins (including
   coagulation and complement factors, immunoglobulin, several proteases and protease
   inhibitors). Under physiological conditions, endogenous protease inhibitors, such as al
   antitrypsin, tightly regulate the activity of neutrophil elastase. However, at inflammatory sites,
25 neutrophil elastase is able to evade regulation, and once unregulated it can induce the release
   of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and interleukin-8, leading to acute lung
   injury. It can even impair host defence against infection by degrading phagocyte surface
   receptors and opsonins. Its negative role is illustrated by its involvement in the tissue
   destruction and inflammation that characterise numerous diseases, including hereditary
30 emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, adult respiratory distress
   syndrome, ischemic-reperfusion injury and rheumatoid arthritis.

     WO 2015/110826                                                          PCT/GB2015/050155
                                                 3
           There is strong evidence associating tryptase and chymase with a number of mast cell
   mediated allergic, immunological and inflammatory diseases. The fact that neutrophil
   elastase, cathepsin G and proteinase 3 also seem to play significant roles in these types of
   diseases point to DPP1 being a valid therapeutic target due to its central role in activating
 5 these proteases (Adkison et al. 2002, J Clin Invest, 109, 363-271; Pham et al. 2004, J
   Immunol, 173, 7277-7281).
           W02004/110988 relate to certain nitrile derivatives and their use as DPP1 inhibitors.
           W02009/074829 relate to peptidyl nitriles and their use as DPP1 inhibitors.
           W02010/128324 relate to a-amino amide nitriles and their use as DPP1 inhibitors.
10         W02012/119941 relate to peptidyl nitrile compounds and their use as DPP1 inhibitors.
           W02013/041497 relate to N-[1-cyano-2-(phenyl)ethyl]-2-azabicyclo[2.2. 1]heptane-3
           carboxamide and their use as DPP1 inhibitors.
           W02001/096285 and W02003/048123 relate to p-amino amide nitriles that have an
           inhibitory activity on cysteine proteases.
15      There is no disclosure of an amide nitrile compound which bears a p-amino acid in the
   form of the disclosed (2S)-N- [(1S)- 1-cyano-2-phenylethyl] -1,4-oxazepane-2-carboxamide
   compounds. We have now found that such compounds possess potent DPP1 activity and/or
   have desirable pharmacological activity profiles (for example a decreased risk of binding to
   elastin rich tissues, such as the aorta).

15 branched chain alkyl groups and may be, but is not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl or i
   propyl.
        In this specification, unless stated otherwise, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" is
   used to characterize a moiety (e.g. a salt, dosage form, or excipient) as being appropriate for
   use in accordance with sound medical judgment. In general, a pharmaceutically acceptable
20 moiety has one or more benefits that outweigh any deleterious effect that the moiety may
   have. Deleterious effects may include, for example, excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic
   response, and other problems and complications.

   NSAID-induced) and dust-induced asthma, both intermittent and persistent and of all
15 severities, and other causes of airway hyper-responsiveness; chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease (COPD); bronchitis, including infectious and eosinophilic bronchitis; emphysema;
   bronchiectasis; cystic fibrosis; sarcoidosis; alpha-i antitrypsin deficiency; farmer's lung and
   related diseases; hypersensitivity pneumonitis; lung fibrosis, including cryptogenic fibrosing
   alveolitis, idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, fibrosis complicating anti-neoplastic therapy and
20 chronic infection, including tuberculosis and aspergillosis and other fungal infections;
   complications of lung transplantation; vasculitic and thrombotic disorders of the lung
   vasculature, and pulmonary hypertension; antitussive activity including treatment of chronic
   cough associated with inflammatory and secretory conditions of the airways, and iatrogenic
   cough; acute and chronic rhinitis including rhinitis medicamentosa, and vasomotor rhinitis;
25 perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis including rhinitis nervosa (hay fever); nasal polyposis;
   acute viral infection including the common cold, and infection due to respiratory syncytial
   virus, influenza, coronavirus (including SARS) and adenovirus, acute lung injury, adult
   respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as exacerbations of each of the foregoing
   respiratory tract disease states, in particular exacerbations of all types of asthma or COPD.

   (e.g. bensyl), may be prepared from reacting protected 3-aminopropanol (e.g. N-bensyl-3
15 aminopropanol) with (S)-2-((benzyloxy)methyl)oxirane, in a solvent such as ethanol or
   propanol, at a temperature in the range from 0 to 70 0 C, for example at 40 0 C, followed by
   reacting the crude product with methanesulfonyl chloride, in prescence of a base such as
   DiPEA, in a solvent such as DCM, at a temperature in the range from -10 to 25 0 C, for
   example at -5 0C.
20 Compounds of formula (VI) or an ester thereof, (VIII), (XI) and (XIV) are either
   commercially available, are known in the literature or may be prepared using known
   techniques.
   It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the processes of the present disclosure
25 certain functional groups such as hydroxyl or amino groups in the reagents may need to be

     WO 2015/110826                                                             PCT/GB2015/050155

   protected by protecting groups. Thus, the preparation of the compounds of formula (I) may
   involve, at an appropriate stage, the removal of one or more protecting groups.
            The skilled person will recognise that at any stage of the preparation of the compounds
   of formula (I), mixtures of isomers (e.g. racemates) of compounds corresponding to any of
 5 formulae (II)-(V), (VII)-(X) and (XXII)-(XVI) may be utilized. At any stage of the
   preparation, a single stereoisomer may be obtained by isolating it from a mixture of isomers
   (e.g., a racemate) using, for example, chiral chromatographic separation.
            The protection and deprotection of functional groups is described in 'Protective
   Groups in Organic Synthesis',     4 th Ed, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley (2006) and
10 'Protecting Groups',   3 rd Ed P.J. Kocienski, Georg Thieme Verlag (2005).
            A further embodiment encompasses pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the
   compounds of formula (I).
            A salt of a compound of formula (I) may be advantageous due to one or more of its
15 chemical or physical properties, such as stability in differing temperatures and humidities, or a
   desirable solubility in H 2 0, oil, or other solvent. In some instances, a salt may be used to aid
   in the isolation or purification of the compound. In some embodiments (particularly where the
   salt is intended for administration to an animal, e.g. a human, or is a reagent for use in making
   a compound or salt intended for administration to an animal), the salt is pharmaceutically
20 acceptable.
            Where the compound of formula (I) is sufficiently acidic, pharmaceutically acceptable
   salts include, but are not limited to, an alkali metal salt, e.g. Na or K, an alkali earth metal
   salt, e.g. Ca or Mg, or an organic amine salt. Where the compound of formula (I) is
   sufficiently basic, pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, inorganic
25 or organic acid addition salts.
            There may be more than one cation or anion depending on the number of charged
   functions and the valency of the cations or anions.
   For reviews on suitable salts, see Berge et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19 or "Handbook of
   Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, selection and use", P.H. Stahl, P.G. Vermuth, IUPAC,

     WO 2015/110826                                                           PCT/GB2015/050155

             In a salt proton transfer occurs between the compound of formula (I) and the counter
   ion of the salt. However, in some cases proton transfer may not be complete and the solid is
   not therefore a true salt. In such cases the compound of formula (I) and the "co-former"
   molecules in the solid primarily interact through non-ionic forces such as hydrogen bonding.
 5 It is accepted that the proton transfer is in fact a continuum, and can change with temperature,
   and therefore the point at which a salt is better described as a co-crystal can be somewhat
   subj ective.
            Where an acid or base co-former is a solid at rt and there is no or only partial proton
   transfer between the compound of formula (I) and such an acid or base co-former, a co-crystal
10 of the co-former and compound of formula (I) may result rather than a salt. All such co
   crystal forms of the compound of formula (I) are encompassed by the present disclosure.
             The compounds of formula (I) may form mixtures of its salt and co-crystal forms. It is
   also to be understood that the present disclosure encompasses salt/co-crystal mixtures of the
   compound of formula (I).
15           Salts and co-crystals may be characterized using well known techniques, for example
   X-ray powder diffraction, single crystal X-ray diffraction (for example to evaluate proton
   position, bond lengths or bond angles), solid state NMR, (to evaluate for example, C, N or P
   chemical shifts) or spectroscopic techniques (to measure for example, O-H, N-H or COOH
   signals and IR peak shifts resulting from hydrogen bonding).
20            It is also to be understood that certain compounds of formula (I) may exist in
   solvated form, e.g. hydrates, including solvates of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a
   compound of formula (I).
            In a further embodiment, certain compounds of formula (I) may exist as racemates and
   racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, individual diastereomers and diastereomeric mixtures.
25 It is to be understood that the present disclosure encompasses all such isomeric forms. Certain
   compounds of formula (I) may also contain linkages (e.g. carbon-carbon bonds, carbon
   nitrogen bonds such as amide bonds) wherein bond rotation is restricted about that particular
   linkage, e.g. restriction resulting from the presence of a ring bond or double bond.
   Accordingly, it is to be understood that the present disclosure encompasses all such isomers.
30 Certain compound of formula (I) may also contain multiple tautomeric forms. It is to be
   understood that the present disclosure encompasses all such tautomeric forms. Stereoisomers

     WO 2015/110826                                                         PCT/GB2015/050155
                                                 33
   may be separated using conventional techniques, e.g. chromatography or fractional
   crystallization, or the stereoisomers may be made by stereoselective synthesis.
           In a further embodiment, the compounds of formula (I) encompass any
   isotopically-labeled (or "radio-labelled") derivatives of a compound of formula (I). Such a
 5 derivative is a derivative of a compound of formula (I) wherein one or more atoms are
   replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or
   mass number typically found in nature. Examples of radionuclides that may be incorporated
   include 2 H (also written as "D" for deuterium).
           In a further embodiment, the compounds of formula (I) may be administered in the
10 form of a prodrug which is broken down in the human or animal body to give a compound of
   the formula (I). Examples of prodrugs include in vivo hydrolysable esters of a compound of
   the formula (I).
   An in vivo hydrolysable (or cleavable) ester of a compound of the formula (I) that contains a
   carboxy or a hydroxy group is, for example, a pharmaceutically acceptable ester which is
15 hydrolyzed in the human or animal body to produce the parent acid or alcohol. For examples
   of ester prodrugs derivatives, see: Curr.Drug.Metab. 2003, 4, 461.
   Various other forms of prodrugs are known in the art. For examples of prodrug derivatives,
   see: Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2008, 7, 255 and references cited therein.
20 EXAMPLES
   The disclosure will now be further explained by reference to the following non limiting
   examples.
   (i) Unless stated otherwise, 1H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance III
   spectrometers operating at a field strength of 400, 500 or 600 MVUlz. Either the central peaks of
25 chloroform-d (CDCl 3 ; 6 H 7.27 ppm), dimethylsulfoxide-d 6 (d6 -DMSO;     6H  2.50 ppm) or
   methanol-d 4 (CD 3 0D; 6 H 3.31 ppm) were used as references.
   (ii) MS spectra were either recorded on a Micromass ZQ single quadrapole LC-MS or Quattro
   Micro LC-MS-MS, following analytical HPLC, using a Phenomenex Luna 5[t C18 (2), 100 x
   4.6 mm. (plus guard cartridge) column, and a gradient of ACN containing 0.l1% formic acid in
30 0.1% aq formic acid, or a Waters Xterra MS 5[t C18 , 100 x 4.6mm. (plus guard cartridge)
   column, and a gradient of ACN in 10 mM aq ammonium hydrogen carbonate. Ionisation was

     WO 2015/110826                                                         PCT/GB2015/050155

   routinely ESCI an option which gives both ESI and APCI data from a single run.
   Alternatively, LC-MS experiments were performed using a Waters Acquity UPLC system
   combined with a Waters Xevo Q-ToF Mass Spectrometer in ESI mode. The UPLC system
   was equipped with both a BEH C18 column (1.7 ptm, 2.1 x 50 mm) in combination with a 46
 5 mM ammonium carbonate/NH 3 buffer at pH 10, and an HSS C18 column (1.8 pim, 2.1 x
   50mm) in combination with 10 mM formic acid, 1 mM ammonium formate buffer at pH 3.
   Where values for m/z are given, generally only ions which indicate the parent mass are
   reported, and the mass ions quoted are the positive or negative mass ions: [M]+, [M+H]+, [M
   H]- or [M+2H-BOC]+.
10 (iii) The title and sub-title compounds of the examples and preparations were named using the
   IUPAC name program ACD/Name 2012 from Acdlabs.
   (iv) Unless stated otherwise, starting materials were commercially available, and all solvents
   and commercial reagents were of laboratory grade and used as received. Unless stated
   otherwise, operations were carried out at ambient temperature, i.e. in the range between 17
15 28 'C and, where appropriate, under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen.
   (iv) The X-ray diffraction analysis was performed according to standard methods, which can
   be found in e.g. Kitaigorodsky, A.I. (1973), Molecular Crystals and Molecules, Academic
   Press, New York; Bunn, C.W. (1948), Chemical Crystallography, Clarendon Press, London;
   or Klug, H.P. & Alexander, L.E. (1974), X-ray Diffraction Procedures, John Wiley & Sons,
20 New York.
   Samples were mounted on single silicon crystal (SSC) wafer mounts and powder X-ray
   diffraction was recorded with a PANalytical X'Pert PRO (reflection geometry, wavelength of
   X-rays 1.5418 A nickel-filtered Cu radiation, Voltage 45 kV, filament emission 40 mA).
   Automatic variable divergence and anti scatter slits were used and the samples were rotated
25 during measurement. Samples were scanned from 2 - 50 '2Theta using a 0.0130 step width
   and 116 or 233 seconds count time using a PIXCEL detector (active length 3.35 '2Theta).
   It is known in the art that an X-ray powder diffraction pattern may be obtained which has one
   or more measurement errors depending on measurement conditions (such as equipment,
   sample preparation or machine used). In particular, it is generally known that intensities in an
30 X-ray powder diffraction pattern may fluctuate depending on measurement conditions and
   sample preparation. For example, persons skilled in the art of X-ray powder diffraction will

     WO 2015/110826                                                            PCT/GB2015/050155
                                                   35
   realise that the relative intensities of peaks may vary according to the orientation of the
   sample under test and on the type and setting of the instrument used. The skilled person will
   also realise that the position of reflections can be affected by the precise height at which the
   sample sits in the diffractometer and the zero calibration of the diffractometer. The surface
 5 planarity of the sample may also have a small effect. Hence a person skilled in the art will
   appreciate that the diffraction pattern data presented herein is not to be construed as absolute
   and any crystalline form that provides a power diffraction pattern substantially identical to
   those disclosed herein fall within the scope of the present disclosure (for further information
   see Jenkins, R & Snyder, R.L. 'Introduction to X-Ray Powder Diffractometry' John Wiley &
10 Sons, 1996).
   Generally, a measurement error of a diffraction angle in an X-ray powder diffractogram may
   be approximately plus or minus 0.1 02-theta, and such a degree of a measurement error should
   be taken into account when considering the X-ray powder diffraction data. Furthermore, it
   should be understood that intensities might fluctuate depending on experimental conditions
is and sample preparation (e.g. preferred orientation). The following definitions have been used
   for the relative intensity (%): 81 - 100%, vs (very strong); 41 - 80%, str (strong); 21 - 40%,
   med (medium); 10 - 20%, w (weak); 1 - 9%, vw (very weak).

   PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY
   Test Al: Fluorescence assay for recombinant human (RH) DPP1
   The activity of DPP1 was determined by measuring the enzymatic release of aminomethyl
   coumarin (AMC) from the peptide substrate (H-Gly-Arg-AMC), which leads to an increase in
io fluorescence intensity at Xex =350nm and Xem =450nm. The assay was carried out in black
   384 well plates in a final volume of 50 [l at 22 'C. The assay conditions contained the
   following: 25 mM piperazine buffer pH 5.0; 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT; 0.010%(v/v) Triton X
    100; 100 [tM H-Gly-Arg-AMC and rhDPP1 (-50 pM). Potential inhibitors were made up in
   DMSO and then diluted in the assay to give a final concentration of not exceeding 1% (v/v)
15 DMSO. A 10-point half-log dilution series of the inhibitors (highest concentration typically
    10 [tM) was tested and the pIC5 0 determined using a 4-paramater logistic equation in a non
   linear curve fitting routine. A standard DPP1 inhibitor, 4-amino-N-[(1S)-1-cyano-2-(4'
   cyanobiphenyl-4-yl)ethyl]tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-carboxamide (W02010/128324, Ex. 3) was
   used as a positive control in the assay. Routinely, inhibitors were pre-incubated with rhDPP1
20 for 30-60 min prior to the addition of the peptide substrate to start the reaction for a further 60
   min at 22 'C. After that the plates were immediately read in a fluorescence plate reader using
   the above emission and excitation wavelengths [modified from Kam, CM, Gotz, MG, Koot,

   carboxamide, disclosed as a DPP1 inhibitor (W02010/128324, Ex. 3), showed a high level of
   aortic retention in rat QWBA studies. To assist the design of DPP1 inhibitors with a decreased
   risk of binding to elastin rich tissues, such as the aorta, the in-vitro competitive aortic binding
   assay disclosed below (Test B) was developed to facilitate the selection process. Reference
 5 compounds and selected compounds representing the present disclosure were tested in Test B
   and the results obtained are shown in Table 12.
   Test B: In-vitro competitive aortic tissue binding assay
   Aortic homogenate was prepared from the thoracic aortae of Han Wistar rats. Freshly isolated
10 thoracic aortae were frozen, and later thawed and stripped of non-elastic material. Stripped
   aortae were then weighed, cut into small pieces and homogenised first with a rotor-stator
   homogeniser; and then with a loose-fit, and then a tight-fit, Dounce homogeniser in Puck's
   saline (137 mM NaCl, 5.37 mM KCl, 4.17 mM NaHCO 3 , and 5.55 mM D-glucose).
   Homogenate concentration was adjusted to 30 mg/mL in Puck's saline, and aliquots were
15 stored at -80 C until use. Positive and negative control compounds and test compounds were
   made up to 100 mM in DMSO, and added to 1 mL aliquots of aortic homogenate in Puck's
   saline for a final concentration of 100 pM. Homogenate samples were pre-incubated with test
   compounds at 37 'C, rotating, overnight. [ 1 4 C]4-Amino-N-[(1S)-1-cyano-2-(4'
   cyanobiphenyl-4-yl)ethyl]tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-carboxamide was then added to all samples
20 to a final concentration of 100 piM, and samples were incubated at 37 'C, rotating, for a
   further 2 h. Protein was precipitated from each sample by the addition of 10 mL acetone, pre
   chilled to -20 'C. Samples were left overnight at -20 'C to allow complete precipitation.
   Precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 4,500 x g at 4 'C for 20 min, an aliquot of
   supernatant was removed for analysis, and the remainder of the supernatant discarded.
25 Precipitate was washed by resuspension in 10 mL 80% methanol in distilled water, and re
   pelleted by centrifugation at 4,500 x g at 4 'C for 20 min. Washing was repeated for a total of
   4 washes in 80% methanol, and 2 further washes in 100% methanol, an aliquot of supernatant

 5 W02006/001751) and DMSO vehicle were run as negative controls. Duplicate samples were
   tested for each compound on each experimental occasion, and at least two experiments were
   run for each test compound. Mean radioactivity of the samples pre-incubated with DMSO
   vehicle control was taken to be 100% binding, and results for samples pre-incubated with
   other compounds were expressed as% difference from vehicle control. 1-way ANOVA and
10 Bonferroni's multiple comparison tests were performed to calculate significance of
   differences from vehicle control.
   The results obtained are shown in Table 12 below. The results are quantified into four
   different categories: strong binder, medium binder, binder and no binder.
