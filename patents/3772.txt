    Technical field of the invention
    This        invention              relates           generally        to   product          packaging.
10  More         particularly,                   this         invention        relates          a    product
    packaging             for      a    solid        product       block,     in     particular           for a
    dispenser system.
    Background of the invention
15
    Solid         products             are       usually         dispensed         in      solid     product
    dispensers,                 for       example            by   spraying        or      flushing          with
    water,         to     create          a   use      solution.        Some     solid       products        are
    caustic or corrosive and should be handled without coming
20  into         direct          contact            with        the   solid       product.          This      is
    particularly true in industrial laundry, wear washing and
    floor care products.
    To      package             solid         products,            shrink      wrapped          foils        are
25  commonly              used.           Small          holes       in     the        foil       allow       an
    evacuation              of otherwise                 trapped      air    during the           shrinking
    of     the      film as           the      film shrinks            to   conform to            the     shape
    of the solid product. Through these small holes, moisture
    from        the      atmosphere               might       enter      the   package,          which       may
30  cause         a     solid        product           to     swell     and    at      least      partially
    dissolve.             This may            lead to          a user,     a person handling the
    product,             getting             into        direct      contact          with      the       solid

WO 2015/078484                                                                   PCT/EP2013/074692
                                                  -2
    product that has escaped through the shrink wrapped foil.
    Thus,       it    is     challenging          to     load       solid       product     into      a
    dispenser          without         getting       into      contact          with    the    solid
    product.          Also       a     removal      of      a     solid       product      from       a
 5  dispenser,            for     example       in    case        of     a   blockage       of   the
    dispenser,           is    not     possible       with       this      type     of   packaging
    without         the     user      getting      into       direct        contact       with   the
    solid product.
10  SUMMARY        OF THE INVENTION
    It    is    therefore           an     object     of    the       present       invention      to
    provide         a    product         packaging         for      holding        a    substance,

    Accordingly,             a    product       packaging             for    a    solid    product
    block,       in   particular            for a   dispenser            system,      comprises       a
    wrapping         means        comprising        a     top,       sides,      and    a  bottom,
    forming a cavity with an                     opening configured and arranged
30  to    receive        the     solid      product       block,        a   mesh    covering     the
    opening        fluid permeable,              and a lid attached removably to

WO 2015/078484                                                                   PCT/EP2013/074692
                                                  -3
    the mesh         in a closed position for                     sealing the opening of
    the wrapping means.
    The     wrapping         means       may    be    formed        of    a    rigid        material,
 5  which       allows        for     forming        the     wrapping          means         into     its
    final      shape,        for    example       according          to    the      solid      product
    block,        independently             from      and     prior        to      receiving         the
    solid      product.         The      wrapping        means       comprises            an   opening
    configured            and     arranged        to     receive         the       solid       product
10  block, wherein the size of the opening may at least match
    the     size     of    the    solid      product        block      to    be     received.         The
    opening       may be        closed      after       the    solid       product         block     has
    been placed inside the wrapping means.                                The opening may be
    closed        for       example        by     welding          the      material           of    the
15  wrapping          means       together.           The     closed         opening           may      be
    reopened         prior      to    use    or    automatically             when       placing      the
    product       packaging           with    the     solid      product         block       inside       a
    dispenser.            The    opening        is     covered        by     a     mesh,       through
    which       a    fluid,       for      example        water,        for      dissolving          the
20  solid      product        block      may    get     into     contact         with the         solid
    product.         The    dissolved        solid      product        may,       for example           in
    form     of    a    use    solution,        exit      the    wrapping          means       through
    the     opening        and    the    mesh      covering        the     opening.          The   mesh
    and/or the lid may be formed integrally with the wrapping
25  means.       The     opening        of  the     wrapping         means       may      be   covered
    by    a  lid,       which     may be       removed       prior       to    using       the    solid
    product.          The     lid     may     be     formed        from      a     material         like
    plastic         or     aluminium          foil.        The      lid     may       be      attached
    removably to the mesh in a closed position of the product
30  packaging sealing the opening of the wrapping means.

                                                        -4
    By      using         a     wrapping             means          comprising              an       opening
    configured            and      arranged           to      receive          the      solid        product
    block       it   is    possible to use a fluid                          impermeable material
    for    the      wrapping          means,        thus        avoiding         any      contact         of      a
 5  user       with       the      solid         product           or      the     dissolved             solid
    product        on the outside of the wrapping means. Further by
    providing          a    mesh      which        is     covering           the     opening          of    the
    wrapping        means,         the     solid       product           may be        prevented           from
    falling out of the wrapping means,                                    as it     is     held back by
10  the     mesh.      Further,           using        a    lid      attachable            to     the      mesh
    allows        for     keeping         the     solid         product         enclosed          prior        to
    use,     thus      avoiding          any     contact          of     a   user     with      the      solid
    product        block.         Thus,      the      product          packaging           according           to
    the    invention           has     the      advantage           that      the     risk      of    a    user
15  handling          the      product          packaging             and      the      solid        product
    getting         into       contact          with      the        substance           of     the      solid
    product        block,       in    particular            when       loading         or unloading               a
    dispenser, is significantly reduced.
20  According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the
    mesh      is    a    flexible          foil       or      a   rigid        thermoplastic.                The
    mesh in        form of         a   flexible          foil      may be        formed        integrally
    with a wrapping means                     in form of a                foil. The         foil may be
    a    fluid        impermeable             shrink          wrapped          foil,        as     any       air
25  trapped        inside         the     wrapping            means        during       the      shrinking
    may    escape        through         the      mesh.         Thus,      a   cost-efficient               way
    of    enclosing          the     solid       product         block        may     be    used      and      at
    the      same      time        avoiding            a    person           handling          the       solid
    product         block          from         getting           into        contact           with        the
30  dissolved          product,           for      example           at     the     outside           of    the
    wrapping means.                The mesh may              also be formed in form of a
    rigid        thermoplastic              mesh,        wherein           the     mesh       made        of      a

    rigid        thermoplastic             has   the     advantage         that     the      shape    of
    the     mesh       does      not     change     with     a   progressing           solution       of
    the solid product block.
 5  According           to     an   embodiment         of    the    invention         the     mesh    is
    generated             by      laser       cutting,          in     particularly             in    an
    assembled           position          of  the    mesh      attached         to   the     wrapping
    means. The mesh is generated by laser cutting wherein the
    material          the     mesh      is   formed      from may        be     attached        to  the
10  wrapping means               before,       during       or   after      the    solid      product
    block         has    been      inserted        into     the     wrapping        means       and/or
    enclosed by the wrapping means.                             The material the mesh is
    generated from may be a foil or a thermoplastic part into
    which         the    fluid      permeable         openings         of   the     mesh      are   cut
15  into        by     a    laser       beam.      This      has     the      advantage          of   an
    efficient            production          process,        as    the    size      and     shape     of
    the     mesh are           generated according tool-less                       and according
    to the product which is being produced at the time.
20  According to              an embodiment            of the invention              the wrapping
    means         comprises         a    flange      for    attaching          the     mesh     and/or
    the      lid.       The     flange       may    surround         at   least       part      of  the
    opening          of     the     wrapping       means,        wherein         the    flange      may

    inside the opening of the wrapping means. The flange has
    the     advantage        that      the    mesh       and/or         the     lid    may    be
    securely attached to the wrapping means.
 5  According to an embodiment of the invention the wrapping
    means      is   a    foil,     in   particular          an      at    least     partially
    fluid soluble foil, or a thermoformed plastic. A wrapping
    means in form of a foil has the advantage that the solid
    product      block may be          wrapped      in     a cost-efficient             way.    A
10  further       advantage       is   that    the     same      foil      may be     used    to
    wrap solid product blocks                 of different             shapes     and sizes.
    The     wrapping       means      in   form     of      an     at     least     partially
    fluid, e.g. water, soluble foil may be designed in a way,
    that      for    example       the    lid      and/or       the       opening      may    be
15  removed       or   reopened       by   dissolving          an    according        part    of
    the    wrapping       means.      The   wrapping         means       may    be   at   least
    partially         dissolved        by    spraying          and/or         flushing       the
    wrapping       means     with     the    fluid       used       for    dissolving        the
    solid      product      block,       for   example         water.        This     has    the
20  advantage        that     the    solid     product         block        may    be   safely
    packed      for     handling       without       the     need        for    opening      the
    product       packaging       prior    to     loading        it     into    a   dispenser
    for     example,       as    the    necessary          openings,         i.e.     the    lid
    and/or opening, are removed and/or reopened automatically
25  when the product            packaging       is   first      getting into contact
    with     the    fluid     for    dissolving         the     solid product           block.
    This may be         after loading a product                  packaging containing
    a   solid product          block     into a dispenser               and    starting the
    spraying       and/or      flushing      operation.          A wrapping          means    in
30  form of a thermoformed plastic has the advantage that the
    wrapping means          may be       moulded      or formed by             deep    drawing
    prior      to    placing       the    solid      product          block      inside      the

    wrapping means. Also the wrapping means may provide for a
    very     rigid      encasing         of    the     solid       product,         which        has     the
    advantage          that     the       wrapping         means        may     keep         its     shape
    during       the     dissolving           of   the       solid      product         block.          This
 5  allows       for    a   save       removal       of    the      product       packaging             even
    with remaining solid product inside.
    According to           an embodiment              of the invention                the opening,
    the mesh and the lid are located at the top and/or bottom
10  of    the    wrapping        means.        The     opening,          the   mesh         and/or       the
    lid may be located in the same or different places of the
    wrapping means. The opening with the mesh and the lid may
    both       for     example          be    arranged            at     the     bottom           of     the
    wrapping means, thus allowing for the solid product block
15  being       sprayed       with        water       from       the      bottom        through          the
    mesh. An arrangement of an opening and the lid at the top
    as    well      as    at   the       bottom       together          with      a    mesh       at     the
    bottom       would,      for       example,         allow       water     to     enter         at    the
    top     of     the    wrapping          means        for       dissolving           the      soluble
20  solid       product       block        in    order        to     form     a     use       solution,
    wherein         the    use      solution         may       exit       the    wrapping            means
    through        the    opening        and    the      mesh       arranged        at     the     bottom
    of the wrapping means.
25  According          to    an     embodiment            of     the      invention            the      mesh
    located        at   the    bottom of          the      wrapping         means        is     designed
    in     form      of   a   product          carrier          comprising           at      least       one
    handling         means.      The     mesh     in     form       of   the    product          carrier
    may be designed to                 accommodate the solid product block in
30  an    undissolved           state,        wherein          the     weight        of      the     solid
    product block may be supported by the mesh.                                       The at         least

    means.        The      mesh        may       be        formed             integrally           with      the
    wrapping        means       for     example           by      cutting          the    mesh      into     the
15  material        of    the     wrapping            means.            This      has    the     advantage,
    the mesh may be produced in a cost-efficient way. The lid
    may be integrated into the wrapping means by wrapping the
    solid      product        block        in     a     foil,         wherein          the    part    of     the
    wrapping        means       forming         the        lid       is     a   fluid      soluble       foil.
20  The part of the wrapping means made of fluid soluble foil
    and     forming       the     lid      may      be      dissolved             by    spraying       and/or

25  thus      dissolving          the       soluble            part       of      the    wrapping        means
    and     removing        the     lid       and      making           the      opening       accessible.
