FIELD OF THE INVENTION
     [002]  The present invention relates to methods and compounds for preventing, treating and
diagnosing inflammatory conditions in a subject. Provided are further methods of identifying
compounds suitable for preventing, treating and diagnosing inflammatory conditions in a subject.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
     [003]  The following discussion of the background of the invention is merely provided to aid
the reader in understanding the invention and is not admitted to describe or constitute prior art to
the present invention.
    [004]  Uncontrolled inflammatory processes play an important role in many diseases such as
infections, sepsis, septic shock, allergies and auto immune diseases, as well as chronic diseases
such as arteriosclerosis. Beside the specific, adaptive immune system unspecific, inflammatory
processes of the innate immune system have also been the focus of attention recently. The innate
immune system represents the first line of defence against invading pathogens and other external
harmful agents. The recognition of conserved structures of various pathogens by specific "Pattern
Recognition Receptors" (PRR) is well characterized. PRR include inter alia the family of Toll
like-receptors (TLR), which initiate the activation of the inflammation process, also known as the
"Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern" (PAMP). As an example, during an infection with gram
negative bacteria Lipopolysaccharid (LPS) very effectively induces an inflammatory response via
the LPS-receptor complex (TLR4/MD2/CD14) in phagocytes, inter alia the induction of
proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFt and ILI1p.

                                                 2
     [0051 Therapeutic approaches of blocking TLR4 are already being examined in clinical
studies. Furthermore during the last years so-called "Damage Associated Molecular Pattern"
(DAMP) have been identified, which are proteins that are being released by activated or necrotic
cells during cell stress. These endogenous ligands or "Alarmins" likewise activate PRR, thereby
amplifying the inflammatory immune response and enhancing inflammatory reactions. Two
DAMP proteins are members of the S100-protein family, namely S100A8 and S100A9.
     [006] Current therapies aimed at blocking TLR4 - as far as they concern the binding site for
endotoxins of gram negative bacteria - encompass an increased risk of infection, since such a
therapy inevitably likewise blocks the response to such bacterial products. It would thus be
desirable to be able to inhibit inflammation reactions by an approach that avoids this adverse
effect.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
     [007] Provided herein are methods and compounds that are suitable for inhibiting
inflammation reactions in a vertebrate organism. In contrast to conventional therapeutic
approaches a method or use as described herein involves affecting the action of two endogenous
TLR4 ligands, namely S100A8/S100A9. Thereby such a use or method is substantially more
specific than conventional approaches.
     [008] In blood of healthy individuals the proteins S100A8 and S100A9 are present in the
form of an inactive complex. For their pro-inflammatory function to unfold, the proteins need to
be activated. The present inventors have identified this activation mechanism, and thereby also a
very specific starting point for novel approaches of anti-inflammatory therapies.
     [009] In a first aspect the present invention provides a compound that has a binding
specificity to an epitope of a vertebrate S1 00A9 protein. The epitope has an amino acid sequence
of a region, which corresponds to the amino acid that spans the range from amino acid position
63 to amino acid position 79 of the human protein S100A9 of the Uniprot/Swissprot accession
number P06702 (version 147 as of 5 September 2012, SEQ ID NO: 77). Any reference to "the"
human protein S100A9 concerns the protein of the sequence of this data base entry. This region,
i.e. amino acid positions 63-79 of the human protein S100A9, also corresponds to the amino acid
sequence that spans the range from amino acid position 63 to amino acid position 79 of the
bovine protein S100A9. This region also corresponds to the amino acid sequence from amino
acid position 62 to amino acid position 78 of the putative horse protein S100A9
(Swissprot/Uniprot accession No F6RM82, version 10 of 5 September 2012, SEQ ID NO: 79).
The region also corresponds to the amino acid sequence from amino acid position 62 to amino
acid position 78 of the putative marmoset protein S100A9 (Swissprot/Uniprot accession no

                                                3
F71D42, version 8 as of 5 September 2012, SEQ ID NO: 80). The region also corresponds to the
amino acid sequence from amino acid position 62 to amino acid position 78 of the putative
marmoset protein S100A9 (Swissprot/Uniprot accessionNo. F71D42, version 15 of24 July 2013,
SEQ ID NO: 81). As a further example, this region corresponds to the amino acid sequence from
amino acid position 63 to amino acid position 79 of the bovine protein S1 00A9
(Swissprot/Uniprot accession No E 1BLI9, version 14 of 29 May 2013, SEQ ID NO: 85). In
typical embodiments the compound according to the first aspect is an immunoglobulin or a
proteinaceous binding partner with a binding specificity to the above epitope.

of a vertebrate S100A9 protein. In some embodiments the compound according to the first aspect
is a compound for use as a medicament or for use in diagnosis.
    [011] In a second aspect the present invention provides a compound that has a binding

of a region that corresponds to the amino acid sequence that spans the range from amino acid
position 73 to amino acid position 85 of the human protein S100A9 of SEQ ID NO: 77 (cf.
below). This region also corresponds to the amino acid sequence from amino acid position 72 to
amino acid position 84 of the putative horse protein S1 00A9 (Swissprot/Uniprot accession No
F6RM82, version 10 of 5 September 2012, SEQ ID NO: 79). In typical embodiments the
compound according to the second aspect is an immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding
partner with a binding specificity to the above epitope.
    [012]  In some embodiments the compound according to the second aspect is a compound for
use as a medicament or for use in diagnosis.
    [013]  In a third aspect the present invention provides a compound that has a binding
specificity to an epitope of a vertebrate S1 00A8 protein. The epitope has an amino acid sequence
of a region that corresponds to the amino acid sequence that spans the range from amino acid
position 55 to amino acid position 71 of the human protein S100A8, which has
Uniprot/Swissprot accession number P05109 (version 138 as of 5 September 2012, SEQ ID NO:
78). Any reference to "the" human protein S100A8 concerns the protein of the sequence of this
data base entry. This region, i.e. amino acid positions 55-71 of the human protein S100A8, also
corresponds to the amino acid sequence from amino acid position 58 to amino acid position 73 of
the putative opossum protein S1 00A8 (Swissprot/Uniprot accession No F6SK92, version 9 of 5
September 2012, SEQ ID NO: 82). In typical embodiments the compound according to the third
aspect is an immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding partner with a binding specificity to the
above epitope.

heterodimeric complex S100A8/S100A9, and the heterotetrameric complex (S100A8/ S100A9) 2 .
Hence, generally more heterotetrameric complex is formed. As a result, less heterodimeric
complex is available, which is capable of binding to the TLR4 receptor.

protein, or the functional fragment of a S1 00A8 protein, the S1 00A9 protein, or the functional

associated with an inflammation.

suffering from an inflammatory disorder. The method includes administering to the subject a

a body fluid of the subject to be increased.

analysed for the presence of a binding partner of the peptide or peptidomimetic. In some
embodiments the sample is also analysed for the identity of a binding partner of the peptide or
peptidomimetic. By contacting the peptide or peptidomimetic with the sample a reaction mixture
is formed. The method also includes allowing a complex to form between the isolated peptide or
peptidomimetic and a binding partner in the reaction mixture. Further the method includes
isolating the peptide or peptidomimetic from the reaction mixture. The peptide or peptidomimetic
is still present in a complex with the binding partner. The method furthermore includes analysing
the binding partner. Analysing the binding partner may include determining one or more physical
properties such as its molecular weight. Analysing the binding partner may also include
determining whether it is a peptide or protein, a nucleic acid molecule, a lipid, a polysaccharide,
a cell a virus or other matter. Where the binding partner is a peptide or protein, a polysaccharide
or a nucleic acid molecule, the sequence of the binding partner may further be analysed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
    [098]  The present invention can be taken to generally relate to compounds and methods that
can be used in the control of inflammatory reactions of an organism. More specifically,
compounds and methods are provided for controlling the interaction of an S1 00A8 protein and/or
of an S1 00A9 protein with a TLR4 receptor.
    [099]  The protein name "S100" was originally chosen due to the prteins' solubility in 100%
ammonium sulphate. S100A8 and S100A9, also known as MRP8 and MRP14, or calgranulin A
and calgranulin B, respectively, are two members of the S100 family of Ca 2 -binding proteins.
S1 00A8 and S1 00A9 are constitutively expressed in neutrophils, monocytes, and some epithelial
cells, while not generally expressed in tissue macrophages or lymphocytes. Monocytes and
neutrophil granulocytes express the proteins in large amounts, mainly as S1 00A8/S 100A9
heterodimers. S1 00A8 and S1 00A9 proteins contribute to approximately 40-500% of the soluble,
cytosolic content of granulocytes. Neutrophils, activated monocytes, and macrophages produce
these proteins in response to stress, infection, inflammation, tissue injury, and septic shock.
S1 00A8 and S1 00A9 are being released at the site of inflammation specifically and in an energy
dependent manner, which is tightly controlled. S1 00A8 and S1 00A9 are important damage
associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules. The S100A8/S100A9 complex is an
endogenous ligand of TLR4 on monocytes. Both S100A8 and S100A9 directly bind to the TLR4
receptor complex and induce pro-inflammatory effector mechanisms via the known, classical
signal transduction cascade. Hence, S100A8/S100A9 is an important factor in pathogenesis of
inflammations.
    [100]   S100A8 and S100A9 already serve as biochemical markers for chronic and acute
inflammation. Both S100 proteins show strong pro-inflammatory activities in many

                                               17
inflammatory reactions, e.g., sepsis, lung and skin infections, arthritis and auto immune diseases.
Direct application of Si 00A8 into the knee joint for instance causes severe joint inflammation
and destruction of cartilage. In an experimental mouse model of a T cell dependent autoimmune
disease both proteins also induce the generation and activation of autoreactive CD8 + T cells,
leading to an increased IL17 mediated immune response.
    [101] As calcium-binding cytosolic molecules S100 proteins are characterized by two
calcium-binding EF hands with different affinities for calcium connected by a central hinge
region. The EF-hand motifs have two a-helices flanking a central calcium-binding loop, thus
resulting in a classical helix-loop-helix motif. S1 00A8 and S1 00A9 can form monovalent
homodimers and a heterodimer known as Si00A8/A9 (MRP8/14, calprotectin), in the following
also referred to as a homodimeric complex and a heterodimeric complex, respectively, as well as
even higher oligomeric forms. S1 00A8 and S1 00A9 have also been found to form a
heterotetramer, in the following also referred to as a heterotetrameric complex. Tetramer
formation is strictly dependent on the presence of calcium, and in the absence of calcium, the
heterodimer is the preferred form of S1 00A8 and S1 00A9.
    [102]   The present invention is based on the identification of a binding site in S100A8
proteins and a binding site in S1 00A9 proteins for a TLR4 receptor. The invention is further
based on the surprising finding that the binding site for a TLR4 receptor, both of S1 00A8 and of
S1 00A9 proteins, is becoming inaccessible during the formation of a heterotetrameric complex,
which is for ease of reference also referred to as (S100A8/ S100A8) 2 . As can be taken from Fig.
 1A, while the heterotetrameric complex between S100A8 and S100A9 does not induce an
inflammatory response in monocytes, the individual proteins S1 00A8 and S1 00A9 induce a
particular strong, pro-inflammatory response in monocytes. This response is comparable to a
stimulation by LPS. Likewise homodimers of S1 00A8 and of S1 00A9 induce this response.
    [103]   The Toll-like receptor 4, or TLR4 receptor, also termed CD284, plays an important role
in the activation of the innate immune system of an organism, as it detects lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. In some
embodiments of a method or a use disclosed herein TLR4 is the human protein with the
Swissprot/Uniprot accession No 000206 (version 132 of 5 September 2012). In some
embodiments TLR4 is the bovine protein with the Swissprot/Uniprot accession No Q9GL65
(version 88 of II July 2012) or with the Swissprot/Uniprot accession No Q8SQ55 (version 56 of
21 March 2012). In some embodiments TLR4 is the rat protein with the Swissprot/Uniprot
accession No Q9QX05 (version 99 of II July 2012). In some embodiments TLR4 is the mouse
protein with the Swissprot/Uniprot accession No Q9QUK6 (version 113 of 5 September 2012).
In some embodiments TLR4 is the porcine protein with the Swissprot/Uniprot accession No

                                                  18
Q68Y56 (version 62 of 11 July 2012). In some embodiments TLR4 is the chimpanzee protein
with the Swissprot/Uniprot accession No H2QXS5 (version 4 of 13 June 2012). In some
embodiments TLR4 is the horse protein with the Swissprot/Uniprot accession No F6RL35
(version 10 of 11 July 2012). In some embodiments TLR4 is the chicken protein with the
Swissprot/Uniprot accession No C4PCF3 (version 24 of 11 July 2012) or with the
Swissprot/Uniprot accession No Q7ZTG5 (version 67 of 5 September 2012). In some
embodiments TLR4 is the dog protein with the Swissprot/Uniprot accession No F1PDB9
(version 14 of 5 September 2012).
    [104] The present inventors could identify a region on each of S100A8 and S100A9 that is
required for the binding of the respective protein to the TLR4 receptor. For the S1 00A9 protein
this sequence corresponds to amino acid positions 63-85 of the human protein (supra). The
inventors further found that it is sufficient to prevent the region of the S1 00A9 protein - for
instance by sterically covering it, including by allowing the formation of the heterotetrameric
complex described above - which corresponds to amino acid positions 63-79, from binding to a
TLR4 receptor. Blocking this region prevents the initiation of the inflammatory response in
monocytes. This region also corresponds to amino acid positions 63-79 of the bovine protein, of
the gibbon protein, of the Anubis baboon protein, of the bonobo protein, of the panda protein, the
porcine protein, the protein of the African elephant or the protein of guinea pig. This region also
corresponds to amino acid positions 62-78 of the rat protein encoded by Genbank (NCBI) gene
ID: 94195 S1OOa9, of the mouse protein of NCBI accession No NP_033140.1 (SEQ ID NO: 83)
or of the rat protein of NCBI accession No EDM00535.1 (SEQ ID NO: 84). As a further
example, this region corresponds to amino acid positions 61-77 of the protein of the Chinese
endemic bat species of the mouse-eared bat (David's myotis) of the Swissprot/Uniprot accession
No L5MD39 (version 4 of 29 May 2013, SEQ ID NO: 86), or amino acid positions 122-138 of
the ferret protein of the Swissprot/Uniprot accession No G9KM87 (version 10 of 24 July 2013,
SEQ ID NO: 87).
    [105]   It is likewise sufficient to prevent the region of the human S100A9 protein
corresponding to amino acid positions 73-85 from binding to a TLR4 receptor in order to block
the inflammatory response. This region also corresponds to amino acid positions 73-85 of the
bovine protein, of the porcine protein, of the protein of the small-eared galago, of the protein of
the naked mole rat or the protein of guinea pig.
    [106] For the S100A8 protein the inventors have identified the sequence corresponding to
amino acid positions 55-71 of the human protein (supra) as necessary for the binding of a
S100A8 protein to the TLR4 receptor. This region also corresponds to amino acid positions 55-71
of the macaca protein, of the marmoset protein, of the dog protein, of the protein of the European

                                                 19
rabbit, of the ferret protein, of the horse protein, of the bovine protein, of the porcine protein, of
the protein of the African elephant, of the panda protein, of the mouse protein, of the rat protein,
of the protein of the naked mole rat, of the protein of the Chinese hamster, of the rabbit protein,
of the marmoset protein, or of the protein of guinea pig.
    [107] The term "position" when used in accordance with this disclosure means the position
of either an amino acid within an amino acid sequence depicted herein or the position of a
nucleotide within a nucleic acid sequence depicted herein. The term "corresponding" as used
herein also includes that a position is not only determined by the number of the preceding
nucleotides/amino acids, but is rather to be viewed in the context of the circumjacent portion of
the sequence. Accordingly, the position of a given amino acid in accordance with the disclosure
which may be substituted may very due to deletion or addition of amino acids elsewhere in a
(mutant or wild-type) virus. In this regard it is also noted that data base entries on a nucleic acid
sequence of a Si 00A8 protein or a Si 00A9 protein may vary in their coverage of non-translated
regions, thereby identifying different nucleic acid positions, even though the length of the coding
region is unchanged/the same. Similarly, the position of a given nucleotide in accordance with
the present disclosure which may be substituted may vary due to deletions or additional
nucleotides elsewhere in a non-translated region of a virus, including the promoter and/or any
other regulatory sequences or gene (including exons and introns).
    [108] Thus, when a position is referred to as a "corresponding position" in accordance with
the disclosure it is understood that nucleotides/amino acids may differ in terms of the specified
numeral but may still have similar neighbouring nucleotides/amino acids. Such
nucleotides/amino acids which may be exchanged, deleted or added are also included in the term
"corresponding position".
    [109]   Specifically, in order to determine whether an amino acid residue of the amino acid
sequence of a S1 00A8 protein or a S1 00A9 protein different from a known strain corresponds to
a certain position in the amino acid sequence of the known strain, a skilled artisan can use means
and methods well-known in the art, e.g., alignments, either manually or by using computer
programs such as BLAST2.0, which stands for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool or ClustalW
or any other suitable program which is suitable to generate sequence alignments. Accordingly, a
known wild-type virus strain may serve as "subject sequence" or "reference sequence", while the
amino acid sequence or nucleic acid sequence of a virus different from the wild-type virus strain
described herein can serve as "query sequence". The terms "reference sequence" and "wild type
sequence" are used interchangeably herein.
    [110] Provided herein is also a peptide or peptidomimetic, including a peptoid that includes
one of the above sequences or a homolog of such a sequence (supra). A homolog is a biologically

                                                20
active sequence that has at least about 70 %, including at least about 80% amino acid sequence
identity with a given sequence of a polypeptide, such as the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 11. In
some embodiments a homolog is a biologically active sequence that has at least about 85 %
amino acid sequence identity with the native sequence polypeptide. A homolog is a functional
equivalent of an isolated nucleic acid molecule or an isolated peptide or protein described in this
document. With regard to nucleic acid sequences, the degeneracy of the genetic code permits
substitution of certain codons by other codons that specify the same amino acid and hence would
give rise to the same protein. The nucleic acid sequence can vary substantially since, with the
exception of methionine and tryptophan, the known amino acids can be coded for by more than
one codon. Thus, portions or all of the nucleic acid sequences described herein could be
synthesized to give a nucleic acid sequence significantly different from that shown in their
indicated sequence. The encoded amino acid sequence thereof would, however, be preserved.
    [111] In addition, the nucleic acid sequence may include a nucleotide sequence which results
from the addition, deletion or substitution of at least one nucleotide to the 5'-end and/or the 3'
end of the nucleic acid formula shown in a given sequence. Any nucleotide or polynucleotide
may be used in this regard, provided that its addition, deletion or substitution does not alter the
amino acid sequence, which is encoded by the nucleotide sequence. For example, the present
invention is intended to include any nucleic acid sequence resulting from the addition of ATG as
an initiation codon at the 5'-end of the inventive nucleic acid sequence or its derivative, or from
the addition of TTA, TAG or TGA as a termination codon at the 3'-end of the inventive
nucleotide sequence or its derivative. Moreover, a nucleic acid molecule may, as necessary, have
restriction endonuclease recognition sites added to its 5'-end and/or its 3'-end. Such functional
alterations of a given nucleic acid sequence afford an opportunity to promote secretion and/or
processing of heterologous proteins encoded by foreign nucleic acid sequences fused thereto.
    [112] Further, it is possible to delete codons or to substitute one or more codons with codons
other than degenerate codons to produce a structurally modified polypeptide, but one which has
substantially the same utility or activity as the polypeptide produced by the unmodified nucleic
acid molecule. As recognized in the art, the two polypeptides are functionally equivalent, as are
the two nucleic acid molecules that give rise to their production, even though the differences
between the nucleic acid molecules are not related to the degeneracy of the genetic code.
    [113] "Percent   (%)  sequence identity" with respect to amino acid sequences disclosed in this
document is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are
identical with the amino acid residues in a reference sequence, e.g. of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID
NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 12, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if
necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any

                                                     21
conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining
percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in
the art, for instance, using publically available computer software such as BLAST, ALIGN, or
Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters
for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximum alignment over
the full length of the sequences being compared. The same is true for nucleotide sequences
disclosed herein.
    [114] Those skilled in the art will be familiar with the fact that corresponding sequences
need to be compared. The use of a corresponding sequence includes that a position is not only
determined by the number of the preceding nucleotides/amino acids. Accordingly, the position of
a given amino acid in accordance with the disclosure which may be substituted may very due to
deletion or addition of amino acids elsewhere in a (mutant or wild-type) protein such as a
S1 00A8 protein or a S1 00A9 protein. Thus, by a "corresponding position" in accordance with
the disclosure it is to be understood that amino acids may differ in the indicated number - for
instance when comparing data base entries - but may still have similar neighbouring amino acids
(cf. above).
    [115] As mentioned above, in some embodiments a sequence such as a sequence
corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 19 contains a conservative substitution.
Conservative substitutions are generally the following substitutions, listed according to the amino
acid to be mutated, each followed by one or more replacement(s) that can be taken to be
conservative: Ala      -> Gly, Ser, Val; Arg    -> Lys; Asn  ->  Gln, His; Asp ->   Glu; Cys  ->  Ser; Gln
Asn; Glu   ->  Asp; Gly    -> Ala; His   ->   Arg, Asn, Gln; Ile ->  Leu, Val; Leu   -> Ile, Val; Lys -> Arg,
Gln, Glu; Met     ->  Leu, Tyr, Ile; Phe   ->  Met, Leu, Tyr; Ser   -> Thr; Thr  ->  Ser; Trp ->  Tyr; Tyr
Trp, Phe; Val   ->   Ile, Leu. Other substitutions are also permissible and can be determined
empirically or in accord with other known conservative or non-conservative substitutions. As a
further orientation, the following eight groups each contain amino acids that can typically be
taken to define conservative substitutions for one another:
       1) Alanine (Ala), Glycine (Gly);
       2) Aspartic acid (Asp), Glutamic acid (Glu);
       3) Asparagine (Asn), Glutamine (Gln);
       4) Arginine (Arg), Lysine (Lys);
       5) Isoleucine (Ile), Leucine (Leu), Methionine (Met), Valine (Val);
       6) Phenylalanine (Phe), Tyrosine (Tyr), Tryptophan (Trp);
       7) Serine (Ser), Threonine (Thr); and
       8) Cysteine (Cys), Methionine (Met)

                                                      22
    [116] In contrast thereto, more substantial changes, such as the following, do not represent
conservative substitutions: Ala       -> Leu, Ile; Arg   ->  Gln; Asn  ->  Asp, Lys, Arg, His; Asp     -> Asn;
Cys  -> Ala; Gln    -   Glu; Glu  -    Gln; His   -   Lys; Ile -> Met, Ala, Phe; Leu    -> Ala, Met,
Norleucine; Lys     -  Asn; Met     -  Phe; Phe     - Val, Ile, Ala; Trp  -> Phe; Tyr -> Thr, Ser; Val
Met, Phe, Ala.
    [117]   Sequence alignment and analysis of crystal structures of the S100A8 protein (MRP8)
and of the S1 00A9 protein (MRP 14) has previously shown which amino acids are relevant for
calcium binding. Ishikawa et al. (Acta Crystallographica Section D [2000] 56, 559-566) for
example published the structure of the S1 00A8 protein. This document is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control.
By sequence alignment in the sequence FKELDINTDG AVNFQEF of the human protein (SEQ
ID NO: 5), which for instance corresponds to the sequence FKELDINKDG AVNFEEF of the
porcine protein (SEQ ID NO: 48) or the sequence FKELDINQDN AVNFEEF of the Chinese
hamster protein (SEQ ID NO: 53), these authors identified the underlined amino acids as
involved in coordinating calcium ions. These amino acids correspond to amino acid positions 5,
7, 9 and 16 of SEQ ID NO: 5. The authors suggested a calcium-triggered conformational change
of S100 proteins. Which amino acid residues might be involved in binding to a target protein
could, however, not be predicted on the available data.
    [118] In the sequence MEDLDTNADK QLSFEEF of the human S100A9 protein (SEQ ID
NO: 1), which for instance corresponds to the sequence MEDLDTNVDK QLSFEEF of the
bovine protein (SEQ ID NO: 15) or the sequence LEDLDTNADK QLTFEEF of the marmoset
protein (SEQ ID NO: 18), these authors identified the underlined amino acids as involved in
coordinating calcium ions. These amino acids correspond to amino acid positions 5, 7, 9 and 16
of SEQ ID NO: 1.
    [119] In the sequence QLSFEEFIML MAR of the human S100A9 protein (SEQ ID NO: 3)
the authors identified the underlined amino acid, corresponding to amino acid position 6 of SEQ
ID NO: 3, as involved in coordinating calcium ions.
    [120] In uses or methods, in which the formation of a heterotetrameric complex between a
S1 00A8 protein and a S1 00A9 protein is analysed, the above indicated conserved amino acids
should accordingly present, since calcium binding is a requirement for the formation of the
heterotetrameric complex. In uses or methods, in which the binding to a TLR4 receptor is
analysed, the above indicated conserved amino acids generally need not be present, since binding
to the TLR4 receptor occurs only in the homodimeric, heterodimeric or monomeric form of a
S1 00A8 protein or a S1 00A9 protein.

                                                23
    [121] In some embodiments there is provided an immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding
partner. The immunoglobulin or proteinaceous binding partner may have a binding specificity to
an epitope of a vertebrate Si 00A9 protein, being an epitope defined by a region that corresponds
to amino acid positions 63-79 of the human protein S100A9 and/or a region that corresponds to
amino acid position 73-85 of the human protein S100A9. The immunoglobulin or proteinaceous
binding partner may also have a binding specificity to an epitope of a vertebrate S1 00A8 protein,
being an epitope defined by a region that corresponds to amino acid positions 55-71 of the
human protein S100A8. The terms "specific" and "specificity" as used herein are understood to
indicate that the binding partner is directed against, binds to, or reacts with a peptide that has an
amino acid sequence of the respective protein region. Thus, being directed to, binding to or
reacting with includes that the binding partner specifically binds to a region of a S1 00A9 protein
or of a S1 00A8 protein, as applicable. The term "specifically" in this context means that the
binding partner reacts with the corresponding region of S1 00A9 or S1 00A8, as applicable, or/and
a portion thereof, but at least essentially not with another protein. The term "another protein"
includes any protein, including proteins closely related to or being homologous to e.g. S100A9
and S100A8, against which the binding partner is directed to. The term "does not essentially
bind" means that the binding partner does not have particular affinity to another protein, i.e.,
shows a cross-reactivity of less than about 30%, such as less than about 20%, less than about
 10%, including less than about 9, 8, 7, 6 or 5%, when compared to the affinity to S100A9 or
S1 00A8. Whether the binding partner specifically reacts as defined herein above can easily be
tested, inter alia, by comparing the reaction of a respective binding partner with S1 00A9 or
S1 00A8, as applicable, and the reaction of the binding partner with (an) other protein(s). The
term "specifically recognizing", which can be used interchangeably with the terms "directed to"
or "reacting with" means in the context of the present disclosure that a particular molecule,
generally an immunoglobulin, an immunoglobulin fragment or a proteinaceous binding molecule
with immunoglobulin-like functions is capable of specifically interacting with and/or binding to
at least two, including at least three, such as at least four or even more amino acids of an epitope
as defined herein. Generally the immunoglobulin or proteinaceous binding molecule can thereby
form a complex with the respective epitope of S1 00A9 or S1 00A8. Such binding may be
exemplified by the specificity of a "lock-and-key-principle". "Specific binding" can also be
determined, for example, in accordance with Western blots, ELISA-, RIA-, ECL-, IRMA-tests,
FACS, IHC and peptide scans.
    [122] A respective binding partner of e.g. S100A9 or S100A8 may be an immunoglobulin, a
fragment thereof or a proteinaceous binding partner (i.e. molecule) with immunoglobulin-like
functions. Examples of (recombinant) antibody fragments are immunoglobulin fragments such as
Fab fragments, Fv fragments, single-chain Fv fragments (scFv), diabodies or domain antibodies

                                                     24
(Holt, L.J., et al., Trends Biotechnol. (2003), 21, 11, 484-490). An example of a proteinaceous
binding molecule with immunoglobulin-like functions is a mutein based on a polypeptide of the
lipocalin family (WO 03/029462, Beste et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1999) 96, 1898-1903).
Lipocalins, such as the bilin binding protein, the human neutrophil gelatinase-associated
lipocalin, human Apolipoprotein D or glycodelin, possess natural ligand-binding sites that can be
modified so that they bind to selected small protein regions known as haptens. Examples of other
proteinaceous binding molecules are the so-called glubodies (see e.g. international patent
application WO 96/23879 or Napolitano, E.W., et al., Chemistry & Biology (1996) 3, 5, 359
367), proteins based on the ankyrin scaffold (Mosavi, L.K., et al., ProteinScience (2004) 13, 6,
 1435-1448) or crystalline scaffold (e.g. internation patent application WO 01/04144) the proteins
described in Skerra, J. Mol. Recognit. (2000) 13, 167-187, AdNectins, tetranectins and avimers.
Avimers contain so called A-domains that occur as strings of multiple domains in several cell
surface receptors (Silverman, J., et al., Nature Biotechnology (2005) 23, 1556-156 1). Adnectins,
derived from a domain of human fibronectin, contain three loops that can be engineered for
immunoglobulin-like binding to targets (Gill, D.S. & Damle, N.K., Current Opinion in
Biotechnology (2006) 17, 653-658). Tetranectins, derived from the respective human
homotrimeric protein, likewise contain loop regions in a C-type lectin domain that can be
engineered for desired binding (ibid.). Peptoids, which can act as protein ligands, are oligo(N
alkyl) glycines that differ from peptides in that the side chain is connected to the amide nitrogen
rather than the a carbon atom. Peptoids are typically resistant to proteases and other modifying
enzymes and can have a much higher cell permeability than peptides (see e.g. Kwon, Y.-U., and
Kodadek, T., J. Am. Chem. Soc. (2007) 129, 1508-1509). A molecule that forms a complex with a
binding partner of S1 00A9 or S1 00A8 may likewise be an immunoglobulin, a fragment thereof
or a proteinaceous binding molecule with immunoglobulin-like functions, as explained above.
Thus, in an exemplary embodiment detecting the amount of e.g. S100A9 or S100A8 may be
carried out using a first antibody or antibody fragment capable of specifically binding proSP-B,
as well as a second antibody or antibody fragment capable of specifically binding the first
antibody or antibody fragment. The documents cited above are incorporated herein by reference in
their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control.
    [123]    The term "antibody" as used herein, is understood to include an immunoglobulin and
an immunoglobulin fragment that is capable of specifically binding a selected protein, e.g.
proSP-B, as well as a respective proteinaceous binding molecule with immunoglobulin-like
functions. As an illustrative example an antibody may be a camel heavy chain immunoglobulin.
As a few further non-limiting examples, an antibody may be an EGF-like domain, a Kringle
domain, a fibronectin type I domain, a fibronectin type II domain, a fibronectin type III domain, a
PAN domain, a Gla domain, a SRCR domain, a Kunitz/Bovine pancreatic trypsin Inhibitor

                                                25
domain, tendamistat, a Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domain, a Trefoil (P-type) domain, a
von Willebrand factor type C domain, an Anaphylatoxin-like domain, a CUB domain, a
thyroglobulin type I repeat, an LDL-receptor class A domain, a Sushi domain, a Link domain, a
Thrombospondin type I domain, an immunoglobulin domain or a an immunoglobulin-like
domain (see above for further examples). In some embodiments an antibody is an aptamer,
including a Spiegelmer@, described in e.g. WO 01/92655. An aptamer is typically a nucleic acid
molecule that can be selected from a random nucleic acid pool based on its ability to bind a
selected other molecule such as a peptide, a protein, a nucleic acid molecule a or a cell.
Aptamers, including Spiegelmers, are able to bind molecules such as peptides, proteins and low
molecular weight compounds. Spiegelmers@ are composed of L-isomers of natural
oligonucleotides. Aptamers are engineered through repeated rounds of in vitro selection or
through the SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) technology. The
affinity of Spiegelmers to their target molecules often lies in the pico- to nanomolar range and is
thus comparable to immunoglobulins. An aptamer may also be a peptide. A peptide aptamer
consists of a short variable peptide domain, attached at both ends to a protein scaffold.
Throughout this document the term antibody may be used in conjunction with the term
"proteinaceous binding partner", even though the term "antibody" includes such a binding
partner. This redundant twofold denomination is merely intended to take account of the frequent
usage of the word "antibody" in the art, synonymously designating an immunoglobulin an
antibody.
    [124] By "fragment" in reference to a polypeptide such as an immunoglobulin or a
proteinaceous binding molecule is meant any amino acid sequence present in a corresponding
polypeptide, as long as it is shorter than the full length sequence and as long as it is capable of
performing the function of interest of the protein - in the case of an immunoglobulin specifically
binding to the desired target, e.g. antigen (proSP-B, for example). The term "immunoglobulin
fragment" refers to a portion of an immunoglobulin, often the hypervariable region and portions
of the surrounding heavy and light chains that displays specific binding affinity for a particular
molecule. A hypervariable region is a portion of an immunoglobulin that physically binds to the
polypeptide target.
    [125]  An immunoglobulin may be monoclonal or polyclonal. The term "polyclonal" refers to
immunoglobulins that are heterogenous populations of immunoglobulin molecules derived from
the sera of animals immunized with an antigen or an antigenic functional derivative thereof. For
the production of polyclonal immunoglobulins, one or more of various host animals may be
immunized by injection with the antigen. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the
immunological response, depending on the host species. "Monoclonal immunoglobulins" or
"Monoclonal antibodies" are substantially homogenous populations of immunoglobulins to a

                                               26
particular antigen. They may be obtained by any technique which provides for the production of
immunoglobulin molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. Monoclonal immunoglobulins
may be obtained by methods well known to those skilled in the art (see for example, K6hler et
al., Nature (1975) 256, 495-497, and U.S. Patent No. 4,376, 110). An immunoglobulin or
immunoglobulin fragment with specific binding affinity only for e.g. a region that corresponds to
amino acid positions 63-79 of the human protein S100A9, for a region that corresponds to amino
acid position 73-85 of the human protein S100A9 or a region that corresponds to amino acid
positions 55-71 of the human protein S100A8 can be isolated, enriched, or purified from a
prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism. Routine methods known to those skilled in the art enable
production of both immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments and proteinaceous binding
molecules with immunoglobulin-like functions, in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.
     [126] In more detail, an immunoglobulin may be isolated by comparing its binding affinity
to a protein of interest, e.g. S100A9 or S100A8, with its binding affinity to other polypeptides.
Humanized forms of the antibodies may be generated using one of the procedures known in the
art such as chimerization or CDR grafting. In general, techniques for preparing monoclonal
antibodies and hybridomas are well known in the art. Any animal such as a goat, a mouse or a
rabbit that is known to produce antibodies can be immunized with the selected polypeptide, e.g. a
polypeptide with the sequence of a region that corresponds to amino acid positions 63-79 of the
human protein S100A9, for a region that corresponds to amino acid position 73-85 of the human
protein S100A9 or a region that corresponds to amino acid positions 55-71 of the human protein
S100A8.
     [127]  Methods for immunization are well known in the art. Such methods include
subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection of the polypeptide. One skilled in the art will recognize
that the amount of polypeptide used for immunization and the immunization regimen will vary
based on the animal which is immunized, including the species of mammal immunized, its
immune status and the body weight of the mammal, as well as the antigenicity of the polypeptide
and the site of injection.
     [128]  The polypeptide may be modified or administered in an adjuvant in order to increase
the peptide antigenicity. Methods of increasing the antigenicity of a polypeptide are well known
in the art. Such procedures include coupling the antigen with a heterologous protein (such as
globulin or p-galactosidase) or through the inclusion of an adjuvant during immunization.
     [129]  Typically, the immunized mammals are bled and the serum from each blood sample is
assayed for particular antibodies using appropriate screening assays. As an illustrative example,
anti-S 100A9 or anti-S 100A8 immunoglobulins may be identified by immunoprecipitation of 125 _
labeled cell lysates from cells expressing a polypeptide with the sequence of a region that

                                               27
corresponds to amino acid positions 63-79 of the human protein S100A9, for a region that
corresponds to amino acid position 73-85 of the human protein S100A9 or a region that
corresponds to amino acid positions 55-71 of the human protein S100A8. Anti-S100A9 or anti
S100A8 immunoglobulins may also be identified by flow cytometry, e.g., by measuring
fluorescent staining of Ramos cells incubated with an antibody believed to recognize anti
S100A9 or anti-S 100A8.
    [130] For monoclonal immunoglobulins, lymphocytes, typically splenocytes, from the
immunized animals are removed, fused with an immortal cell line, typically myeloma cells, such
as SP2/0-Agl4 myeloma cells, and allowed to become monoclonal immunoglobulin producing
hybridoma cells. Typically, the immortal cell line such as a myeloma cell line is derived from the
same mammalian species as the lymphocytes. Illustrative immortal cell lines are mouse myeloma
cell lines that are sensitive to culture medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin and
thymidine ("HAT medium"). Typically, HAT-sensitive mouse myeloma cells are fused to mouse
splenocytes using 1500 molecular weight polyethylene glycol ("PEG 1500"). Hybridoma cells
resulting from the fusion may then be selected using HAT medium, which kills unfused and
unproductively fused myeloma cells (unfused splenocytes die after several days because they are
not transformed).
    [131]   Any one of a number of methods well known in the art can be used to identify a
hybridoma cell which produces an immunoglobulin with the desired characteristics. Typically the
culture supernatants of the hybridoma cells are screened for immunoglobulins against the
antigen. Suitable methods include, but are not limited to, screening the hybridomas with an
ELISA assay, Western blot analysis, or radioimmunoassay (Lutz et al., Exp. Cell Res. [1988] 175,
 109-124). Hybridomas prepared to produce anti-S 100A9 or anti-S 100A8 immunoglobulins may
for instance be screened by testing the hybridoma culture supernatant for secreted antibodies
having the ability to bind to a recombinant cell line expressing a polypeptide with the sequence
of a region that corresponds to amino acid positions 63-79 of the human protein S100A9, for a
region that corresponds to amino acid position 73-85 of the human protein S100A9 or a region
that corresponds to amino acid positions 55-71 of the human protein S100A8. To produce
antibody homologs which are within the scope of the invention, including for example, anti
S100A9 or anti-S 100A8 antibody homologs, that are intact immunoglobulins, hybridoma cells
that tested positive in such screening assays can be cultured in a nutrient medium under
conditions and for a time sufficient to allow the hybridoma cells to secrete the monoclonal
immunoglobulins into the culture medium. Tissue culture techniques and culture media suitable
for hybridoma cells are well known in the art. The conditioned hybridoma culture supernatant
may be collected and for instance the anti-Si 00A9 immunoglobulins or the anti-Si 00A8
immunoglobulins optionally further purified by well-known methods. Alternatively, the desired

                                                28
immunoglobulins may be produced by injecting the hybridoma cells into the peritoneal cavity of
an unimmunized mouse. The hybridoma cells proliferate in the peritoneal cavity, secreting the
immunoglobulin which accumulates as ascites fluid. The immunoglobulin may be harvested by
withdrawing the ascites fluid from the peritoneal cavity with a syringe.
    [132]  Hybridomas secreting the desired immunoglobulins are cloned and the class and
subclass are determined using procedures known in the art. For polyclonal immunoglobulins,
immunoglobulin containing antisera is isolated from the immunized animal and is screened for
the presence of immunoglobulins with the desired specificity using one of the above-described
procedures. The above-described antibodies may also be immobilized on a solid support.
Examples of such solid supports include plastics such as polycarbonate, complex carbohydrates
such as agarose and sepharose, acrylic resins and such as polyacrylamide and latex beads.
Techniques for coupling antibodies to such solid supports are well known in the art.
    [133]  A plurality of conventional display technologies is available to select an
immunoglobulin, immunoglobulin fragment or proteinaceous binding molecule. Li et al.
(Organic & Biomolecular Chemistry (2006), 4, 3420-3426) have for example demonstrated how
a single-chain Fv fragment capable of forming a complex with a selected DNA adapter can be
obtained using phage display. Display techniques for instance allow the generation of engineered
immunoglobulins and ligands with high affinities for a selected target molecule. It is thus also
possible to display an array of peptides or proteins that differ only slightly, typically by way of
genetic engineering. Thereby it is possible to screen and subsequently evolve proteins or peptides
in terms of properties of interaction and biophysical parameters. Iterative rounds of mutation and
selection can be applied on an in vitro basis.
    [134]  In vitro display technology for the selection of peptides and proteins relies on a
physical linkage between the peptide or protein and a nucleic acid encoding the same. A large
panel of techniques has been established for this purpose, with the most commonly used being
phage/virus display, ribosome display, cell-surface display, 'peptides on plasmids', mRNA
display, DNA display, and in vitro compartmentalisation including micro-bead display (for
reviews see e.g. Rothe, A., et al., FASEB J. (2006) 20, 1599 -1610; Sergeeva, A., et al., Advanced
Drug Delivery Reviews (2006) 58, 1622-1654).
    [135]  Different means of physically linking a protein or peptide and a nucleic acid are also
available. Expression in a cell with a cell surface molecule, expression as a fusion polypeptide
with a viral/phage coat protein, a stabilised in vitro complex of an RNA molecule, the ribosome
and the respective polypeptide, covalent coupling in vitro via a puromycin molecule or via
micro-beads are examples of ways of linking the protein/peptide and the nucleic acid presently
used in the art. A further display technique relies on a water-in-oil emulsion. The water droplets

                                                29
serve as compartments in each of which a single gene is transcribed and translated (Tawfik, D.S.,
& Griffiths, A.D., Nature Biotech. (1998) 16, 652-656, US patent application 2007/0105117).
This physical linkage between the peptide or protein and the nucleic acid (encoding it) provides
the possibility of recovering the nucleic acid encoding the selected protein or peptide. Compared
to techniques such as immunoprecipitation, in display techniques thus not only binding partners
of a selected target molecule can be identified or selected, but the nucleic acid of this binding
partner can be recovered and used for further processing. Present display techniques thus provide
means for e.g. target discovery, lead discovery and lead optimisation. Vast libraries of peptides or
proteins, e.g. antibodies, potentially can be screened on a large scale.
    [136] As indicated above, a detectable marker may be coupled to a binding partner of a
polypeptide with the sequence of a region that corresponds to amino acid positions 63-79 of the
human protein S100A9, for a region that corresponds to amino acid position 73-85 of the human
protein S100A9 or a region that corresponds to amino acid positions 55-71 of the human protein
S100A8, as the case may be, or a molecule that forms a complex with the binding partner of one
of these peptides. A respective detectable marker, which may be coupled to a binding partner of
one of these peptides, or a molecule that forms a complex therewith, may be an optically
detectable label, a fluorophore, or a chromophore. Examples of suitable labels include, but are
not limited to, an organic molecule, an enzyme, a radioactive, fluorescent, and/or chromogenic
moiety, a luminescent moiety, a hapten, digoxigenin, biotin, a metal complex, a metal and
colloidal gold. Accordingly an excitable fluorescent dye, a radioactive amino acid, a fluorescent
protein or an enzyme may for instance be used to detect e.g. the level of S1 00A9 and/or S1 00A8,
in which the region required for binding to the TLR4 receptor is accessible. Examples of suitable
fluorescent dyes include, but are not limited to, fluorescein isothiocyanate, 5,6-carboxymethyl
fluorescein, Cascade Blue@, Oregon Green@, Texas red, nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl,
coumarin, dansyl chloride, rhodamine, amino-methyl coumarin, DAPI, Eosin, Erythrosin,
BODIPY@, pyrene, lissamine, xanthene, acridine, an oxazine, phycoerythrin, a Cy dye such as
Cy3, Cy3.5, Cy5, Cy5PE, Cy5.5, Cy7, Cy7PE or Cy7APC, an Alexa dye such as Alexa 647, and
NBD (Naphthol basic dye). Examples of suitable fluorescent protein include, but are not limited
to, EGFP, emerald, EYFP, a phycobiliprotein such as phycoerythrin (PE) or allophycocyanin,
Monomeric Red Fluorescent Protein (mRFP), mOrange, mPlum and mCherry. In some
embodiments a reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent protein such as Dronpa, bsDronpa and
Padron may be employed (Andresen, M., et al., Nature Biotechnology (2008) 26, 9, 1035).
Regarding suitable enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, soybean peroxidase, or horseradish
peroxidase may serve as a few illustrative examples. In some embodiments a method of detection
may include electrophoresis, HPLC, flow cytometry, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy or a

                                              30
modified form of these techniques. Some or all of these steps may be part of an automated
separation/detection system.
    [137]  An immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding partner as described in this document
may in some embodiments be used in diagnosis of a condition associated with an inflammatory
process in the organism of a subject. As explained above, accessibility of the region
corresponding to amino acid positions 63 - 79 of the human protein S100A9, as well as the
region corresponding to amino acid positions 73 - 85 of the human protein S100A9 and
accessibility of the region corresponding amino acid positions 55 - 71 of the human protein
S1 00A8 indicates that binding to the TLR4 receptor by S1 00A9 and S1 00A8 can occur, since the
proteins are not in a heterotetrameric complex. Accordingly, an immunoglobulin or a
proteinaceous binding partner with a binding specificity as defined above can be used to diagnose
that a subject is suffering from an inflammatory condition, in which S100A9 and S100A8 are
involved. Furthermore, typically at least some sites of inflammationin the organism of the subject
can be identified.
    [138]  In some embodiments a method of diagnosing an inflammatory condition by using an
immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding partner with the above specificity involves the use of
a molecular imaging technique. For this purpose the immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding
partner may have a radioactive label. Two illustrative examples of a suitable radioactive label are
1I   and 89Zr, which may be coupled to the immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding partner by
means of a chelating moiety. In some embodiments 68Ga may also be used as a radioactive label.
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging may then be used. A typical PET scanner that is
used in the art can detect concentrations between 10-1 M and 10-42 M, which is sufficient for the
detection of S1 00A9 and S1 00A8. PET can quantitatively image the distribution of a
radiolabeled immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding partner within the organism of the
subject. Further molecular imaging techniques that may be used include, but are not limited to,
molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bioluminescence, fluorescence, targeted
ultrasound, and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). An overview on
molecular imaging techniques has been given by Dzik-Jurasz (The British Journal of Radiology
(2003) 76 S98-S 109). In some embodiments the immunoglobulin or proteinaceous binding
partner may be coupled to a nanoparticle such as a nanocrystal.
    [139]  Where desired, an immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding partner as defined
above may be used in a hybrid imaging approach. For example, a PET/CT or a SPECT/CT
camera is a commercially available combined system, which allows sequentially acquiring both
anatomic and functional information that is accurately fused in a single examination. Integrated
PET/ magnetic resonance imaging allows a correction for motion of organs or subjects. Magnetic

                                                 31
resonance imaging also offers information about perfusion and blood flow, which may be desired
in PET reconstruction and data analysis in the context of inflammation. Molecular imaging by
means of an immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding partner may also be carried out in the
form of photoacoustic tomography (PAT) or combined with PAT. PAT is based on the conversion
from optical to ultrasonic energy. Currently PAT is carried out by irradiating the biological tissue
to be imaged using a nanosecond-pulsed laser beam to engender thermal and acoustic impulse
responses. Today, PAT is generally implemented as focused-scanning photoacoustic microscopy
(PAM), photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE).
    [140] An immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding partner as disclosed in this document
may in some embodiments be used in therapy, in particular in treating a condition, including a
disease, associated with an inflammatory process in the organism of a subject. An
immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding partner as disclosed in this document may also be
used in preventing a condition associated with an inflammatory process in the organism of a
subject. The term "preventing" refers to decreasing the probability that an organism contracts or
develops an abnormal condition. In some embodiments such an immunoglobulin or
proteinaceous binding partner is used in preventing or treating chronic or acute aseptic
inflammation, neuropathic pain, primary graft failure, ischemia-reperfusion injury, reperfusion
injury, reperfusion edema, allograft dysfunction, pulmonary reimplantation response and/or
primary graft dysfunction in organ transplantation in a subject in need thereof. An
immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding partner as disclosed in this document may also be
used in the treatment of septic shock, asthmatic conditions, Crohn's disease, ulcerous colitis,
reperfusion injury, auto-immune diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis,
restenosis, coronary heart disease, diabetes, rheumatoidal diseases, dermatological diseases, such
as psoriasis and seborrhea, graft rejection, and inflammation of the lungs, heart, kidney, oral
cavity (e.g., periodontitis) or uterus. It is understood that the immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous
binding partner may also find use in diagnosis of such a condition.
    [141] A respective method includes administering an immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous
binding partner as disclosed herein. In some embodiments the immunoglobulin or proteinaceous
binding partner may be administered in combination with a TLR4 inhibitor. In some
embodiments the immunoglobulin or proteinaceous binding partner may be administered in
combination with a TLR2, a MYD88, a TICAMI and/or a TIRAP inhibitor.
    [142]   "Treating" or "treatment" or "alleviation" refers to both therapeutic treatment and
prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent, slow down (lessen) or at
least partially alleviate or abrogate an abnormal, including pathologic, condition in the organism.
Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those prone to

                                                32
having the disorder or those in whom the disorder is to be prevented (prophylaxis). The term
"administering" relates to a method of incorporating a compound into cells or tissues of an
organism.
    [143] As explained above, in some embodiments there is provided a peptide or a
combination of peptides. Where a peptide is provided, the peptide is isolated. Likewise where a
combination of peptides is provided, the peptides of the combination of peptides are isolated. The
term "isolated" indicates that the peptide(s) or nucleic acid molecule(s) has/have been removed
from its/their normal physiological environment, e.g. a natural source, or that a peptide or nucleic
acid is synthesized. Use of the term "isolated" indicates that a naturally occurring sequence has
been removed from its normal cellular, e.g. chromosomal, environment. Thus, the sequence may
be in a cell-free medium or placed in a different cellular environment. Thus, a cell or cells may
be included in a different medium such as an aqueous solution than provided originally, or placed
in a different physiological environment. Typically isolated cells, peptides or nucleic acid
molecule(s) constitute a higher fraction of the total cells, peptides or nucleic acid molecule(s)
present in their environment, e.g. solution/suspension as applicable, than in the environment from
which they were taken. By "isolated" in reference to a polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule is
meant a polymer of amino acids (2 or more amino acids) or nucleotides coupled to each other,
including a polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule that is isolated from a natural source or that is
synthesized. The term "isolated" does not imply that the sequence is the only amino acid chain
or nucleotide chain present, but that it is essentially free, e.g. about 90 - 95% pure or more, of e.g.
non-amino acid material and/or non-nucleic acid material, respectively, naturally associated with
it.
    [144] As indicated above, instead of or in addition to peptides, peptidomimetics may
likewise be used in the context of the present invention. The term "peptidomimetic" as used
herein refers to a compound that has the same general structure as a corresponding polypeptide,
but which includes modifications that increase its stability or biological function. In some
embodiments a peptidomimetic may include one or more D-amino acids, essentially consist of
D-amino acids or consist of D-amino acids. D-amino acids are the optical isomer of a naturally
occurring L amino acid. A D amino acid can be taken to be a mirror image of a L amino acid.
Stretches of D amino acids are less prone to be degraded in a host organism via proteolysis. In
some embodiments a peptidomimetic may be an inverso analog, which is an analog of the same
sequence that consists only of D amino acids. In some embodiments a peptidomimetic may be a
"reverso" analogue of a given peptide, which means that the peptidomimetic includes the reverse
sequence of the peptide. In some embodiments a peptidomimetic may be a "D-retro-enantiomer
peptide", which is an analog that consists of D-amino acids, with the sequence arranged in the
reversed order. A peptidomimetic may also include, essentially consist of or consist of a peptoid.

                                                     33
A peptoid differs from peptides in that the side chain is connected to the amide nitrogen rather
than the a carbon atom. A peptoid can thus be taken to be an oligo(N-alkyl) glycine, which
nevertheless has the same or substantially the same amino acid sequence as the corresponding
polypeptide. Peptoids are typically resistant to proteases and other modifying enzymes and can
have a much higher cell permeability than peptides, see e.g. Kwon, Y.-U., and Kodadek, T., J.
Am. Chem. Soc. (2007) 129, 1508-1509. This document is incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control.
    [145] The peptide or peptidomimetic may be prepared by any method, such as by
synthesizing the peptide or peptidomimetic, or by expressing a nucleic acid encoding an
appropriate amino acid sequence in a cell and harvesting the peptide from the cell. A combination
of such methods may likewise be used. Methods of de novo synthesizing peptides and
peptidomimetics, and methods of recombinantly producing peptides and peptidomimetics are
well known in the art.
    [146] The peptide or peptidomimetic, or the combination of peptides or peptidomimetics as
disclosed herein may capable of interfering with the binding of a Si 00A8 protein and/or a
S1 00A9 protein to a TLR4 receptor. Where the TLR4 receptor is present on the surface of a cell,
as a result, cellular signalling induced by the binding of the respective S1 00A8 protein to the
TLR4 receptor may likewise be induced. The terms "signalling" and "signal transduction
pathway" refer to cellular mechanisms and to molecules that act on cellular components in
response to a certain condition, change or external stimulus. Typically such mechanisms and
molecules propagate an extracellular signal through the cell membrane to become an intracellular
signal. This signal can then stimulate a cellular response.
    [147] A nucleic acid molecule as disclosed herein may contain one or more sequences that
encode one or more peptides/proteins. In some embodiments among these encoded sequences, or
this encoded sequence, is a sequence that encodes the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or a homolog
thereof. In some embodiments among these encoded sequences, or this encoded sequence, is a

that encodes both the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or a homolog thereof and a sequence that
encodes both the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9 or a homolog thereof.

    [151] The term "nucleic acid" as used herein refers to any nucleic acid molecule in any
possible configuration, such as single stranded, double stranded or a combination thereof.
Nucleic acids include for instance DNA molecules, RNA molecules, analogues of the DNA or
RNA generated using nucleotide analogues or using nucleic acid chemistry, locked nucleic acid
molecules (LNA), protein nucleic acids molecules (PNA) and tecto-RNA molecules (e.g. Liu, B.,
et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. (2004) 126, 4076-4077). A PNA molecule is a nucleic acid molecule in
which the backbone is a pseudopeptide rather than a sugar. Accordingly, PNA generally has a
charge neutral backbone, in contrast to for example DNA or RNA. Nevertheless, PNA is capable
of hybridising at least complementary and substantially complementary nucleic acid strands, just
as e.g. DNA or RNA (to which PNA is considered a structural mimic). An LNA molecule has a
modified RNA backbone with a methylene bridge between C4' and 02', which locks the furanose
ring in a N-type configuration, providing the respective molecule with a higher duplex stability
and nuclease resistance. Unlike a PNA molecule an LNA molecule has a charged backbone. DNA

                                                37
or RNA may be of genomic or synthetic origin and may be single or double stranded. Such
nucleic acid can be e.g. mRNA, cRNA, synthetic RNA, genomic DNA, cDNA, synthetic DNA, a
copolymer of DNA and RNA, oligonucleotides, etc. A respective nucleic acid may furthermore
contain non-natural nucleotide analogues and/or be linked to an affinity tag or a label.
    [152]  Many nucleotide analogues are known and can be used in a method disclosed herein. A
nucleotide analogue is a nucleotide containing a modification at for instance the base, sugar, or
phosphate moieties. As an illustrative example, a substitution of 2'-OH residues of siRNA with
2'F, 2'O-Me or 2'H residues is known to improve the in vivo stability of the respective RNA.
Modifications at the base moiety include natural and synthetic modifications of A, C, G, and T/U,
different purine or pyrimidine bases, such as uracil-5-yl, hypoxanthin-9-yl, and 2-aminoadenin-9
yl, as well as non-purine or non-pyrimidine nucleotide bases. Other nucleotide analogues serve as
universal bases. Universal bases include 3-nitropyrrole and 5-nitroindole. Universal bases are
able to form a base pair with any other base. Base modifications often can be combined with for
example a sugar modification, such as for instance 2'-O-methoxyethyl, e.g. to achieve unique
properties such as increased duplex stability.
    [153]  In some embodiments a nucleic acid molecule as disclosed herein is capable of
expressing the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or a homolog thereof, the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9
or a homolog thereof and/or the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12 or a homolog thereof. In some
embodiments a nucleic acid molecule includes a sequence that allows the sequence of SEQ ID
NO: 6 or a homolog thereof, the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9 or a homolog thereof and/or the
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12 or a homolog thereof to be expressed. The nucleic acid molecule
may for instance include a promoter operatively linked to one or more of these sequences, or to a
sequence that includes one or more of these sequences. In some embodiments a nucleic acid
molecule as disclosed herein includes a termination signal operatively linked to one or more of
these sequences, or to a sequence that includes one or more of these sequences. In some
embodiments a nucleic acid molecule according to the invention includes a regulatory sequence
operatively linked to one or more of these sequences, or to a sequence that includes one or more
of these sequences.
    [154]  The term "regulatory sequence" includes controllable transcriptional promoters,
operators, enhancers, silencers, transcriptional terminators, 5' and 3' untranslated regions which
interact with host cellular proteins to carry out transcription and translation and other elements
that may control gene expression including initiation and termination codons. The regulatory
sequences can be native (homologous), or can be foreign (heterologous) to the cell and/or the
nucleotide sequence that is used. The precise nature of the regulatory sequences needed for gene
sequence expression may vary from organism to organism, but shall in general include a

                                                38
promoter region which, in prokaryotes, contains both the promoter (which directs the initiation of
RNA transcription) as well as the DNA sequences which, when transcribed into RNA, will signal
synthesis initiation. Such regions will normally include those 5'-non-coding sequences involved
with initiation of transcription and translation, such as the TATA box, capping sequence or CAAT
sequence. These regulatory sequences are generally individually selected for a certain
embodiment, for example for a certain cell to be used. The skilled artisan will be aware that
proper expression in a prokaryotic cell also requires the presence of a ribosome-binding site
upstream of the gene sequence-encoding sequence.
    [155]   In some embodiments a nucleic acid molecule as disclosed herein is being expressed in
a cell in order to obtain a peptide with the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or a homolog thereof, the
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9 or a homolog thereof and/or the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12 or a
homolog thereof. In some embodiments the cell expresses a S100A9 protein, and/or a S100A8
protein. As explained below, expression of such a peptide may include the generation of a vector
that has a construct with a sequence encoding the peptide. Once the vector or nucleic acid
molecule that contains the construct(s) has been prepared for expression, the nucleic acid
construct(s) may be introduced into a selected suitable host cell by any of a variety of suitable
means, i.e., transformation, transfection, conjugation, protoplast fusion, electroporation, particle
gun technology, calcium phosphate-precipitation, direct microinjection, and the like. After the
introduction of the vector, recipient cells are grown in a selective medium, which selects for the
growth of vector-containing cells. Expression of the cloned gene(s) results in the production of a
protein or peptide as disclosed herein, or fragments thereof. This can take place in the
transformed cells as such, or following the induction of these cells to differentiate. A variety of
incubation conditions can be used to form a peptide as disclosed herein. It may be desired to use
conditions that mimic physiological conditions.
    [156]   The terms "expression" and "expressed", as used herein, are used in their broadest
meaning, to signify that a sequence included in a nucleic acid molecule and encoding a
peptide/protein is converted into its peptide/protein product. Thus, where the nucleic acid is
DNA, expression refers to the transcription of a sequence of the DNA into RNA and the
translation of the RNA into protein. Where the nucleic acid is RNA, expression may include the
replication of this RNA into further RNA copies and/or the reverse transcription of the RNA into
DNA and optionally the transcription of this DNA into further RNA molecule(s). In any case
expression of RNA includes the translation of any of the RNA species provided/produced into
protein. Hence, expression is performed by translation and includes one or more processes
selected from the group consisting of transcription, reverse transcription and replication.
Expression of the protein or peptide of the member of the plurality of peptides and/ or proteins
may be carried out using an in vitro expression system. Such an expression system may include a

                                                 39
cell extract, typically from bacteria, rabbit reticulocytes or wheat germ. Many suitable systems
are commercially available. The mixture of amino acids used may include synthetic amino acids
if desired, to increase the possible number or variety of proteins produced in the library. This can
be accomplished by charging tRNAs with artificial amino acids and using these tRNAs for the in
vitro translation of the proteins to be selected. A nucleic acid molecule, such as DNA, is said to
be "capable of expressing" a peptide/protein if it contains nucleotide sequences which contain
transcriptional and translational regulatory information and such sequences are operably linked to
nucleotide sequences which encode the polypeptide. A suitable embodiment for expression
purposes is the use of a vector, in particular an expression vector. Thus, provided is also a host
cell transformed/ transfected with an expression vector.
    [157]   In some embodiments a nucleic acid molecule as disclosed herein includes an
expression cassette capable of inducing and/or regulating the expression of a peptide with the
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or a homolog thereof, the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9 or a homolog
thereof and/or the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12 or a homolog thereof. In some embodiments a
nucleic acid molecule as disclosed herein is encompassed by a vector that contains a promoter
effective to initiate transcription in the respective host cell (whether of endogenous or exogenous
origin).
    [158]   As used herein, the term "expression cassette" refers to a nucleic acid molecule
capable of directing expression of a particular nucleotide sequence in an appropriate host cell. An
expression cassette includes a promoter operatively linked to the nucleotide sequence of interest,
which is operatively linked to one or more termination signals. It may also include sequences
required for proper translation of the nucleotide sequence. The coding region can encode a
polypeptide of interest and can also encode a functional RNA of interest, including but not
limited to, antisense RNA or a non-translated RNA, in the sense or antisense direction. The
expression cassette comprising the nucleotide sequence of interest can be chimeric, meaning that
at least one of its components is heterologous with respect to at least one of its other components.
The expression cassette can also be one that is naturally occurring but has been obtained in a
recombinant form useful for heterologous expression. In some embodiments, however, the
expression cassette is heterologous with respect to the host; i.e., the particular nucleic acid
sequence of the expression cassette does not occur naturally in the host cell and was introduced
into the host cell or an ancestor of the host cell by a transformation event. The expression of the
nucleotide sequence in the expression cassette can be under the control of a constitutive promoter
or of an inducible promoter that initiates transcription only when the host cell is exposed to some
particular external stimulus. In the case of a multicellular organism such as a plant or an animal,
the promoter can also be specific to a particular tissue, organ, or stage of development.

                                                40
    [159]  By "gene" is meant a unit of inheritance that occupies a specific locus on a
chromosome and that is a segment of nucleic acid associated with a biological function. A gene
encompasses transcriptional and/or translational regulatory sequences as well as a coding region.
Besides a coding sequence a gene may include a promoter region, a cis-regulatory sequence, a
non-expressed DNA segment that is a specific recognition sequence for regulatory proteins, a
non-expressed DNA segment that contributes to gene expression, a DNA segment designed to
have desired parameters, or combinations thereof. A gene can be obtained by a variety of
methods, including cloning from a biological sample, synthesis based on known or predicted
sequence information, and recombinant derivation of an existing sequence.
    [160]  The term "vector", sometimes also referred to as gene delivery system or gene transfer
vehicle, relates to a macromolecule or complex of molecules that include(s) a polynucleotide to
be delivered to a host cell, whether in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo. Typically a vector is a single or
double-stranded circular nucleic acid molecule that allows or facilitates the transfer of of a
nucleic acid sequence into a cell. A vector can generally be transfected into cells and replicated
within or independently of a cell genome. A circular double-stranded nucleic acid molecule can
be cut and thereby linearized upon treatment with restriction enzymes. An assortment of nucleic
acid vectors, restriction enzymes, and the knowledge of the nucleotide sequences cut by
restriction enzymes are readily available to those skilled in the art. A nucleic acid molecule
encoding a peptide, such as a sequence that includes a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or a homolog
thereof, of SEQ ID NO: 9 or a homolog thereof and/or a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12, or a
homolog thereof, can be inserted into a vector by cutting the vector with restriction enzymes and
ligating the two pieces together. A vector may for instance be a viral vector, such as a retroviral
vector, a Lentiviral vector, a herpes virus based vector or an adenoviral vector. A vector may also
be a plasmid vector, which is also a typical example of a prokaryotic vector. A respective plasmid
may in some embodiments be a plasmid capable of replication in E. coli, such as, for example,
pBR322, ColEl, pSC101, pACYC 184 or irVX. Bacillus plasmids include pC194, pC221 or
pT127. Suitable Streptomyces plasmids include pIJi01, and streptomyces bacteriophages such as
  C3 1. A vector may also be a liposome-based extrachromosomal vector, also called episomal
vector. Two illustrative examples of an episomal vector are an oriP-based vector and a vector
encoding a derivative of EBNA- 1. Lymphotrophic herpes virus is a herpes virus which replicates
in a lymphoblast and becomes a plasmid for a part of its natural life-cycle. A vector may also be
based on an organically modified silicate. In some embodiments a vector may be a transposon
based system, i.e. a transposon/transposase system, such as the so called Sleeping Beauty, the
Frog Prince transposon - transposase system or the TTAA-specific transposon piggyBac system.
Transposons are mobile genetic elements in that they are sequences of DNA that can move

                                                41
around to different positions within the genome of a single cell, a process called transposition. In
the process, a transposon can cause mutations and change the amount of DNA in the genome.
    [161] The term "promoter" as used throughout this document, refers to a nucleic acid
sequence needed for gene sequence expression. Promoter regions vary from organism to
organism, but are well known to those skilled in the art for different organisms. For example, in
prokaryotes, the promoter region contains both the promoter (which directs the initiation of RNA
transcription) as well as the DNA sequences which, when transcribed into RNA, will signal
synthesis initiation. Such regions will normally include those 5'-non-coding sequences involved
with initiation of transcription and translation, such as the TATA box, capping sequence, CAAT
sequence, and the like. Both constitutive and inducible promoters can be used in the context of
the present invention, in accordance with the needs of a particular embodiment. A large number
of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. The selected
promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding a polypeptide described herein by
removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the
isolated promoter sequence into the vector of choice. Both the native promoter sequence and
many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and/or expression of a selected
nucleic acid sequence.
    [162]  In a method disclosed herein a nucleic acid may be introduced into a host cells by any
suitable technique of nucleic acid delivery for transformation of a cell available in the art.
Examples of suitable techniques include, but are not limited to, direct delivery of DNA, e.g. via
transfection, injection, including microinjection, electroporation, calcium phosphate
precipitation, by using DEAE-dextran followed by polyethylene glycol, direct sonic loading,
liposome mediated transfection, receptor-mediated transfection, microprojectile bombardment,
agitation with silicon carbide fibers, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, desiccation/
inhibition-mediated DNA uptake or any combination thereof.
    [163]  A method as disclosed herein may further include measuring the expression of a
sequence that includes a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or a homolog thereof, a sequence of SEQ ID
NO: 9 or a homolog thereof and/or a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12 or a homolog thereof This can
for instance be achieved by determining the number of RNA molecules transcribed from an
encoding nucleic acid molecule that is under the control of a selected promoter. A method
commonly used in the art is the subsequent copy of RNA to cDNA using reverse transcriptase
and the coupling of the cDNA molecules to a fluorescent dye. The analysis may for example be
performed in form of a DNA microarray. Numerous respective services and kits are
commercially available, for instance GeneChip@ expression arrays from Affymetrix. Other

                                               42
means of determining gene expression of a transcription factor include, but are not limited to,
oligonucleotide arrays, and quantitative Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).
    [164] In some embodiments it may be advantageous or desired to calibrate peptide/protein
expression data or to rate them. Thus, in some embodiments a method as disclosed herein
additionally includes the comparison of obtained results with those of one or more control
measurements. Such a control measurement may include any condition that varies from the main
measurement itself. It may include conditions of the method under which for example no
expression of the respective peptide/protein occurs. A further means of a control measurement is
the use of a mutated form of a respective peptide/protein, for example a nucleic acid sequence or
gene not encoding the corresponding peptide/protein that includes the sequence of sequence of
SEQ ID NO: 6 or a homolog thereof, the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9 or a homolog thereof and/or
the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12 or a homolog thereof, or encoding a non-functional
peptide/protein.
    [165] On a general basis the present invention also relates to methods and uses of diagnosing
and methods and uses of treating a S100A8 and/or S100A9 mediated disorder, i.e. a disorder,
condition, or disease state characterized by TLR4 signalling, including excessive TLR4
signalling, induced by one or both of the proteins S100A8 and S100A9. In a specific aspect, the
TLR4 signalling is a level of TLR4 signalling in a cell or tissue suspected of being diseased that
exceeds the level of TLR4 signalling in a similar non-diseased cell or tissue. In a specific aspect,
a S1 00A8 and/or S1 00A9 mediated disorder includes an inflammation. In some embodiments the
use of a peptide or peptidomimetic as disclosed herein allows blocking or reducing the TLR4
signalling activity.
    [166] In some methods and uses as disclosed herein the formation of a complex between
S1 00A8 and/or S1 00A9 and a TLR4 receptor is reduced, including prevented. In some methods
and uses as disclosed herein the formation of a heterotetrameric complex between S1 00A8 and
S1 00A9 is reduced, including prevented.
    [167] In some embodiments a method disclosed herein includes a measurement of the
formation of a complex between S1 00A8 and/or S1 00A9, or a functional fragment of one of
these proteins, and a TLR4 receptor, or a functional fragment of a TLR4 receptor. In the context
of binding to a TLR4 receptor, a functional fragment of S1 00A8 and a functional fragment of
S1 00A9 are defined by two criteria. Firstly, a functional fragment is able to bind to and form a
complex with a TLR4 receptor that is stable enough to affect signal transduction of the TLR4
receptor. Generally such a fragment of S1 00A8 contains an epitope with an amino acid sequence
of a region that corresponds to the amino acid sequence ranging from amino acid position 55 to
amino acid position 71 of the human S100A8 protein. Such a fragment of S100A9 generally

                                                43
contains an epitope with an amino acid sequence of a region that corresponds to the amino acid
sequence ranging from amino acid position 63 to amino acid position 79 and /or ranging from
amino acid position 73 to amino acid position 85 of the human S100A8 protein. Secondly, such a
fragment may have at least 60 % sequence identity with the corresponding amino acid sequence
of a naturally existing variant of S1 00A8 and of S1 00A9, respectively. In some embodiments, a
respective fragment has at least 80 %, such at least 95 % sequence identity with the
corresponding amino acid sequence of a known variant of S1 00A8 and of S1 00A9, respectively.
It is understood that a functional fragment of S1 00A8 or of S1 00A9 is able to be modulated by a
compound in such a way that its complex formation with a TLR4 receptor is affected.
     [168] A functional fragment of the TLR4 receptor is defined by two criteria. Firstly, a
functional fragment is able to bind to and form a complex with a S1 00A8 protein and a S1 00A9
protein that is stable enough to affect signal transduction of the TLR4 receptor. Secondly, such a
fragment may have at least 60 % sequence identity with the corresponding amino acid sequence
of a naturally existing variant of the TLR4 receptor. In some embodiments, a respective fragment
has at least 80 %, such at least 95 % sequence identity with the corresponding amino acid
sequence of a known variant of the TLR4 receptor. It is understood that a functional fragment of
the TLR4 receptor is able to be modulated by a compound in such a way that its complex
formation with a S1 00A8 protein and a S1 00A9 protein is affected.
     [169] In some embodiments a method as disclosed herein includes a measurement of the
bimolecular binding, i.e. the formation of a complex between a S100A8 protein or a functional
fragment of a S100A8 protein, and a S100A9 protein, or a functional fragment of S1OOA9. In
some embodiments a method includes a measurement of the tetramolecular binding, i.e. the
formation of a complex between two molecules of S100A8 or a functional fragment of S1OOA8,
and two molecules of S100A9, or a functional fragment of S1OOA9.
     [170] In the context of binding to each other, a functional fragment of S1OOA8 and a
functional fragment of S10A9 are defined by three criteria. Firstly, a functional fragment of a
S100A9 protein is able to bind to and form a complex with a S100A8 protein that is stable
enough to be detected over more than a millisecond. Likewise, a functional fragment of a
S1 00A8 protein is able to bind to and form a complex with a S1 00A9 protein that is stable
enough to be detected over more than a millisecond. Generally a respective complex has a half
life of more than a millisecond under physiological conditions. Secondly, such a fragment is
capable of binding a calcium ion. A respective fragment may also be able to bind a zinc and/or a
copper ion. Typically, such a fragment of a S1 00A8 protein and of a S1 00A9 protein has at least
one functional EF hand, i.e. an EF hand that contains the conserved amino acids known to be
required for calcium binding. Thirdly, such a fragment may have at least 60 % sequence identity

                                              44
with the corresponding amino acid sequence of a naturally existing variant of Si 00A8 and of
S1 00A9, respectively. In some embodiments, a respective fragment has at least 80 %, such at
least 95 % sequence identity with the corresponding amino acid sequence of a known variant of
S100A8 and of S100A9, respectively. It is understood that a functional fragment of S10A8 and
of S1OOA9, respectively, is able to be modulated by a compound in such a way that its complex
formation with S1 00A9 and of S1 00A8, respectively, is affected.
    [171]  Such a measurement of a complex formation may for instance rely on spectroscopical,
photochemical, photometric, fluorometric, radiological, enzymatic or thermodynamic means, or
on cellular effects. An example of a spectroscopical detection method is fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy. A photochemical method is for instance photochemical cross-linking. The use of
photoactive, fluorescent, radioactive or enzymatic labels, respectively, are examples for
photometric, fluorometric, radiological and enzymatic detection methods. An example of a
thermodynamic detection method is isothermal titration calorimetry. An example of a method
using cellular effects is the measurement of the release of an inflammatory factor from a
monocyte, for example the release of TNFa. Some of these methods may include additional
separation techniques such as electrophoresis or HPLC. In detail, examples for the use of a label
may include a compound as a probe or an immunoglobulin with an attached enzyme, the reaction
catalysed by which leads to a detectable signal. An example of a method using a radioactive label
and a separation by electrophoresis is an electrophoretic mobility shift assay.
    [172]  A measurement of a complex formation between a S100A9 and a S100A8 protein or a
respective fragment, or between a S1 00A9 and/or a S1 00A8 protein or a respective fragment may
be included in a method of identifying a compound suitable for diagnosis, prevention and/or
treatment of a condition associated with an inflammatory state in an organism. The formation of
a complex may be analysed on the basis of the molecular weight of the target of an
immunoglobulin, or a binding partner with immunoglobulin-like functions, specific for S1 00A9
and/or S1 00A8 under non-denaturating conditions. As an illustrative example, signal intensity of
a detectably labelled immunoglobulin or binding partner, for instance by means of a fluorescent
moiety or a moiety generating a fluorescent signal, detecting a target that is found to have an
increased molecular weight, may be quantified and used as an indication of complex formation.
As a further example, the interaction of S100A9 and S100A8 or of S100A9 and/or a S100A8
with TLR4, optionally of respective functional fragments, may be detected on the basis of based
on surface plasmon resonance, for instance using surface plasmon spectroscopy, optical
waveguide lightmode spectroscopy or plasmon-waveguide resonance spectroscopy. Surface
plasmon resonance, an optoelectronic technique, may be measured label-free or using a label
such as a nanoparticle, which may include a metal or a metalloid such as in the form of a
quantum dot. In some embodiments a nanoparticle exhibits a surface plasmon resonance at

                                               45
visible wavelengths, possibly including at near-infrared frequencies. Such a nanoparticle may
include or consist of a noble metal such as gold or silver, i.e. an element of group 11 of the
periodic table of elements (according to the new IUPAC system, group IB according to the old
IUPAC system and the CAS system), or an element of group 10 of the periodic table of elements
(according to the new IUPAC system, in group VIIIA according to the old IUPAC system and
group VIII of the CAS system) such as palladium or platinum. Respective nanoparticles show
strong plasmon resonance extinction bands in the visible spectrum, and therefore deep colors
reminiscent of molecular dyes. These extinction bands occur if the incident photo frequency is
resonant with the collective oscillation of the free (conduction) electrons, also known as the
localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). LSPR excitation results in wavelength selective
absorption with extremely large molar extinction coefficients, efficient Rayleigh scattering and
enhanced local electromagnetic fields near the surface of the nanoparticle. A variety of
reviews are available providing an introduction into surface plasmon resonance, which is a
method well established in the art, as well as its application to sensors (see e.g. Willets, K.A., &
Van Duyne, R.P., Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. (2007) 58, 267-297; Homola, J. et al., Anal Bioanal
Chem (2003) 377, 528-539; Schuck, P., Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. (1997) 26, 541-566;
or Hafner, J., Laser Focus World (2006) April, 99-101).
    [173]   A respective method that includes the measurement of a corresponding complex may
in some embodiments include comparing the obtained result to a reference value or to a threshold
value. A threshold value may for example be a value set to decide whether a complex is formed
or not. A threshold value may also be a value set to decide whether a subject suffers from an
inflammatory condition. A threshold value may also be a value set to decide whether a subject
suffers from an inflammatory condition that is associated with S1 00A9 and S1 00A8.
    [174]   In some embodiments the method that includes the measurement of a corresponding
complex is carried out on a sample from a subject suspected to or known to suffer from an
inflammatory condition. A control measurement, in this document also referred to as a reference
measurement, may be a measurement that is carried out on a sample from a subject known not to
suffer from an inflammatory condition. In some embodiments a respective reference
measurement is carried out on a (control) sample from a subject that is age-matched. In some
embodiments such a reference measurement is carried out on a sample from the same subject,
taken at a previous point of time. In a method as disclosed herein the amount of complex formed,
for instance determined in a sample, may be compared to such a reference measurement. In some
embodiments the amount of complex determined in a sample is compared to a threshold value.
Such a threshold value may in some embodiments be a predetermined threshold value. In some
embodiments the threshold value is based the amount of complex determined in a control sample.

                                                46
Generally, a respective control sample may have any condition that varies from the sample used
in the main measurement.
    [175]   In some embodiments the method that includes the measurement of a corresponding
complex is carried out in a mixture of the enriched, purified or isolated components of the
complex, optionally including a substance suspected to affect the complex formation. Proteins
used such as the TLR4 receptor, Si 00A9 or Si 00A8 may have been expressed in recombinant
form, for example in a suitable host organism. Fragments of the TLR4 receptor, S100A9 or
S1 00A8 may likewise have been obtained by expression in recombinant form. Fragments of the
TLR4 receptor, S100A9 or S100A8 may in some embodiments have been synthesized by an
established peptide synthesis technique. Such a measurement is generally carried out in an
aqueous solution that includes a buffer and/or a salt, such as a calcium salt or a zinc salt.
Numerous buffer compounds are used in the art and may be used to carry out the various
processes described herein. Examples of buffers include, but are not limited to, solutions of salts
of phosphate, carbonate, succinate, citrate, acetate, formate, barbiturate, oxalate, lactate,
phthalate, maleate, cacodylate, borate, N-(2-acetamido)-2-amino-ethanesulfonate (also called
(ACES), N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-piperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (also called HEPES), 4-(2
hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine-propanesulfonic acid (also called HEPPS), piperazine-1,4-bis(2-etha
nesulfonic acid) (also called PIPES), (2-[Tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino]-1-ethansulfonic
acid (also called TES), 2-cyclohexylamino-ethansulfonic acid (also called CHES) and N-(2
acetamido)-iminodiacetate (also called ADA). Any counter ion may be used in these salts;
ammonium, sodium, and potassium may serve as illustrative examples. Further examples of
buffers include, but are not limited to, triethanolamine, diethanolamine, ethylamine, triethyl
amine, glycine, glycylglycine, histidine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (also called TRIS),
bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-imino-tris(hydroxylmethyl)methane (also called BIS-TRIS), and N
[Tris(hydroxymethyl)-methyl]-glycine (also called TRICINE), to name a few. The buffers may be
aqueous solutions of such buffer compounds or solutions in a suitable polar organic solvent. As
an illustrative example, a buffer may be deposited in solid form, for example freeze-dried. In
such a case the solid buffer, e.g. a powder, may be dissolved in an aqueous phase by merging and
or mixing, for instance assisted or performed by means of ultrasound. In such a case the amount
of volume of a respective aqueous phase used may for instance be used to obtain the desired final
buffer concentration.
    [176]   In such embodiments, i.e. where a mixture of the enriched, purified or isolated
components of the complex are used, a reference measurement may include the use of any
condition that varies from the condition of the main measurement. As an illustrative example,
where a fragment of the TLR4 receptor, S1 00A9 and/or S1 00A8 is used, a reference
measurement may encompass the use of the corresponding full length protein(s). In embodiments

                                                    47
where a compound is included in the main measurement, which is a compound to be tested for its
effect on the respective complex formation, a reference measurement may be a measurement in
which this compound is omitted.
    [177] In some embodiments a threshold value is a collection of data of a plurality of control
samples, which may also be referred to as a reference samples. In such embodiments the
threshold value may be set to be a significant difference between the control and the sample from
the subject of interest. The term "significant" is used to indicate that the level of increase is of
statistical relevance. As an illustrative example a plurality of measurements, including a plurality
of samples may have been obtained from the subject of interest. The p value may then be
determined. A p value of 0.05, 0.02, 0.01 or lower may be taken to indicate a difference. In some
embodiments a significant increase is a deviation of a value of a test sample relative to a value of
a control sample of about 2 fold or more, including 3 fold or more, such as at least about 5 to
about 10 fold or even more.
    [178] As indicated above, a predetermined threshold value may in some embodiments be set
on the basis of data collected from one or more subjects known not to suffer from a disorder
associated with an inflammatory condition. In some embodiments a certain percentile of such
data may be used as a threshold value, e.g. a signal intensity measured in a surface plasmon
resonance measurement or of an antibody signal detecting a complex formation under non
denaturating conditions (supra). The range of the values of a set of data obtained from samples of
subjects or using reference condition in the absence of a test compound, can be divided into 100
equal parts, i.e. percentages of the range can be determined. A percentile represents the value
within the respective range below which a certain percent of the data fall, in other words the
percentage of the values that are smaller than that value. For example the 95th percentile is the
value below which 95 percent of the data are found. In some embodiments a level of proSP-B, or
an effective portion thereof, may be regarded as increased or elevated if it is above the             9 0th
percentile, above the  9 2 nd percentile, above the    9 3rd percentile, above the   9 4 th percentile, above
the 95h percentile, above the    9 6 th percentile, above the   9 7 th percentile, above the   9 8th percentile
or above the 99h percentile.
    [179] The comparison to a threshold value, which may be a predetermined threshold value,
can be carried out manually, semi-automatically or in a fully automated manner. In some
embodiments the comparison may be computer assisted. A computer assisted comparison may
employ values stored in a database as a reference for comparing an obtained value or a
determined amount, for example via a computer implemented algorithm. Likewise, a comparison
to a reference measurement may be carried out manually, semi-automatically or in a fully
automated manner, including in a computer assisted manner.

                                               48
    [180] In some embodiment the formation of a complex described above may be determined
by immobilizing one of the components of the complex on a surface. After contacting the
components of the complex with each other and allowing a complex to form, any non-bound
components of the complex may be removed, typically by exchanging the medium, e.g. buffer
solution encompassing the immobilized complex component. Subsequently the presence of a
component of the formed complex, which was not provided in immobilized form, may be
determined in order to assess whether a complex has formed, and optionally to which extent such
a complex has formed. As an illustrative example it may be intended to determine whether,
including to which extent, a complex between a functional fragment of the TLR4 receptor and a
S100A9 protein and/or a S100A8 protein has formed. In such an embodiment the fragment of the
TLR4 receptor may be immobilized on a surface, for instance on the surface of a well in a multi
well plate. After complex formation and exchange of medium in the well, an immunoglobulin or
a proteinaceous binding partner with a binding specificity to S1 00A9 and/or S1 00A8 may be
used for detection of complex formation. As explained above, an antibody disclosed herein,
having a binding specificity to a region on S100A9 and/or S100A8, interacts with S100A9 and
S100A8, respectively, at the site of binding to the TLR4 receptor. Therefore such an antibody can
only detect S100A9 and/or S100A8, which is not bound to the TLR4 receptor. Accordingly, for
the detection of a S100A9 as well as of a S100A8 protein that is in a complex with the TLR4
receptor, an immunoglobulin or proteinaceous binding partner with a different specificity, i.e.
binding to a different site on S1 00A9 and/or S1 00A8 will generally be used. Such a binding site
on S100A9 is an epitope that differs from the region defined by amino acid positions 63-79
and/or amino acid positions 73-85 of the human protein of Uniprot/Swissprot accession number
P06702. A respective binding site on S100A8 is an epitope that differs from the region defined by
amino acid positions 55-71 of the human protein of Uniprot/Swissprot accession number P05109
(SEQ ID NO: 78). An amtibody of a binding specificity for the region defined by amino acid
positions 63-79 and/or amino acid positions 73-85 of the human S100A9 protein may be used in
a control measurement to determine whether there is any S1 00A9 protein left, in which this
region is accessible.
    [181] Determining the amount of S100A9, S100A8 and/or a TLR4 receptor in a sample can
be carried out by way of any suitable technique available. An illustrative example of a suitable
technique in this regard is a radiolabel assay such as a Radioimmunoassay (RIA) or an enzyme
immunoassay such as an Enzyme Linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA), precipitation
(particularly immunoprecipitation), a sandwich enzyme immune test, an electro
chemiluminescence sandwich immunoassay (ECLIA), a dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluoro
immuno assay (DELFIA), a scintillation proximity assay (SPA), turbidimetry, nephelometry,
latex-enhanced turbidimetry or nephelometry, or a solid phase immune test. Further methods

                                              49
known in the art (such as gel electrophoresis, 2D gel electrophoresis, SDS polyacrylamid gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western Blotting, and mass spectrometry), can be used alone or in
combination with labelling or other detection methods as described herein. While a RIA is based
on the measurement of radioactivity associated with a complex formed between an
immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding molecule with immunoglobulin-like functions and an
antigen, an ELISA is based on the measurement of an enzymatic reaction associated with a
complex formed between an immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding molecule with immuno
globulin-like functions and an antigen. Typically a radiolabel assay or an enzyme-immunoassay
involves one or more separation steps in which a binding partner of e.g. Si 00A9, Si 00A8 and/or
TLR4 that has not formed a complex with S1 00A9, S1 00A8 and/or TLR4 is being removed (cf.
above), thereby leaving only binding partner of S1 00A9, S1 00A8 and/or TLR4 behind, which
has formed a complex with S100A9, S100A8 and/or TLR4. This allows the generation of
specific signals originating from the presence of S1 00A9, S1 00A8 and/or TLR4.
    [182] An ELISA or RIA test can be competitive for measuring the amount of S1 00A9,
S100A8 and/or TLR4, i.e. the amount of antigen. For example, an enzyme labeled antigen is
mixed with a test sample containing antigen, which competes for a limited amount of
immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding molecule with immunoglobulin-like functions. The
reacted (bound) antigen is then separated from the free material, and its enzyme activity is
estimated by addition of substrate. An alternative method for antigen measurement is the double
immunoglobulin/ proteinaceous binding molecule sandwich technique. In this modification a
solid phase is coated with specific immunoglobulin or a proteinaceous binding molecule with
immunoglobulin-like functions. This is then reacted with the sample from the subject that
contains the antigen. Then enzyme labelled specific immunoglobulin/proteinaceous binding
molecule is added, followed by the enzyme substrate. The 'antigen' in the test sample is thereby
'captured' and immobilized on to the sensitized solid phase where it can itself then immobilize the
enzyme labelled immunoglobulin/proteinaceous binding molecule. This technique is analogous to
the immunoradiometric assays.
    [183]  In an indirect ELISA method, an antigen is immobilized by passive adsorption on to
the solid phase. A test serum may then be incubated with the solid phase and any
immunoglobulin in the test serum forms a complex with the antigen on the solid phase. Similarly
a solution of a proteinaceous binding molecule with immunoglobulin-like functions may be
incubated with the solid phase to allow the formation of a complex between the antigen on the
solid phase and the proteinaceous binding molecule. After washing to remove unreacted serum
components an anti-immunoglobulin immunoglobulin anti-proteinaceous binding molecule
immunoglobulin, linked to an enzyme is contacted with the solid phase and incubated. Where the
second reagent is selected to be a proteinaceous binding molecule with immunoglobulin-like

                                              50
functions, a respective proteinaceous binding molecule that specifically binds to the proteinace
ous binding molecule or the immunoglobulin directed against the antigen is used. A complex of
the second proteinaceous binding molecule or immunoglobulin and the first proteinaceous
binding molecule or immunoglobulin, bound to the antigen, is formed. Washing again removes
unreacted material. In the case of RIA radioactivity signals are being detected. In the case of
ELISA the enzyme substrate is added. Its colour change will be a measure of the amount of the
immobilized complex involving the antigen, which is proportional to the antibody level in the
test sample.
    [184] In another embodiment the immunoglobulin or the proteinaceous binding molecule
with immunoglobulin-like functions may be immobilized onto a surface, such as the surface of a
polymer bead (supra), or coated onto the surface of a device such as a polymer plate or a glass
plate. Such an embodiment may be employed in combination with the measurement of the
formation of a complex described above. An immunoglobulin or proteinaceous binding molecule
with a binding specificity to S1 00A9, S1 00A8 and/or TLR4 may be employed to immobilize the
respective target of antibody binding to the surface. A complex may then be allowed to form after
providing the remaining components of the complex, optionally also providing a compound to be
tested for affecting complex formation. Thereafter the formation of the complex may be detected
using a suitable immunoglobulin or proteinaceous binding molecule. By immobilisation, in a
detection technique such as ELISA, the immune complexes can easily be separated from other
components present by simply washing the surface, e.g. the beads or plate. This is the most
common method currently used in the art and is referred to as solid phase RIA or ELISA. This
embodiment may be particularly useful for determining the amount of S1 00A9, S1 00A8 and/or
TLR4. On a general basis, in any embodiment of a radiolabel assay or of an enzyme
immunoassay passive adsorption to the solid phase can be used in the first step. Adsorption of
other reagents can be prevented by inclusion of wetting agents in all the subsequent washing and
incubation steps. It may be advantageous to perform washing to prevent carry-over of reagents
from one step to the next.
    [185]  Various other modifications of ELISA have been used in the art. For example, a system
where the second proteinaceous binding molecule or immunoglobulin used in the double
antibody sandwich method is from a different species, and this is then reacted with an anti
immunoglobulin enzyme conjugate or an anti-proteinaceous binding molecule enzyme conjugate.
This technique comes with the potential advantage that it avoids the labeling of the specific
immunoglobulin or proteinaceous binding molecule, which may be in short supply and of low
potency. This same technique can be used to assay immunoglobulin or proteinaceous binding
molecule where only an impure antigen is available; the specific reactive antigens are selected by
the antibody immobilized on the solid phase.

                                               51
    [186] In another example of an ELISA assay for antigen, a surface, a specific antigen is
immobilized on a surface, e.g. a plate used, and the surface is then incubated with a mixture of
reference immunoglobulins or proteinaceous binding molecules and a test sample. If there is no
antigen in the test sample the reference immunoglobulin or proteinaceous binding molecule
becomes fixed to an antigen sensitized surface. If there is antigen in the test solution this
combines with the reference immunoglobulin or proteinaceous binding molecule, which cannot
then react with the sensitized solid phase. The amount of immunoglobulin/proteinaceous binding
molecule attached is then indicated by an enzyme labeled anti-globulin/anti- binding molecule
conjugate and enzyme substrate. The amount of inhibition of substrate degradation in the test
sample (as compared with the reference system) is proportional to the amount of antigen in the
test system.
    [187]  In some embodiments the amount of S100A9 and/or a S100A8, or the proportion of
S100A9, in which the region corresponding to amino acid positions 63-79 and/or 73-85 of the
human protein S100A9, and/or the region corresponding to amino acid positions 55-71 of the
human protein Si 00A8 are not accessible, determined in or from a sample of a subject can be
compared to a single control sample or a plurality of control samples, such as a sample from a
control subject, in any suitable manner. As an illustrative example, the level of heterodimers and
or heterotetramers of S1 00A9 and S1 00A8 in a control sample can be characterized by an
average (mean) value coupled with a standard deviation value, for example at a given time point.
In some embodiments the level of heterodimers and or heterotetramers of S1 00A9 and S1 00A8
in a subject may be considered increased or decreased when it is one standard deviation or more
higher or lower than the average value of the corresponding heterodimer/ tetramer determined in
one or more control samples. In some embodiments the determined level of heterodimer/
tetramer is regarded as increased or decreased where the obtained value is about 1.5 standard
deviations higher or lower, including about two, about three, about four or more standard
deviations higher or lower than the average value determined in a control sample. In some
embodiments the determined amount of heterodimer/tetramer is regarded as different where the
obtained value is about 1.2 times or more higher or lower, including about 1.5 times, about two
fold, about 2.5-fold, about three fold, about 3.5 fold, about 4-fold, about 5-fold or more higher or
lower than the protein level determined in a control sample. In some embodiments the
determined level of heterodimer/tetramer is regarded as increased where the obtained value is
about 0.8-fold or less, including about 70 %, about 60 %, about 50 %, about 40 %, about 30 %,
about 25 %, about 20 % or lower than the amount of heterodimers and or heterotetramers of
S1 00A9 and S1 00A8 determined in a control sample.
    [188] The compound or combination described herein, including an immunoglobulin or a
proteinaceous binding partner, as well as a compound or combination identified by a method as

                                                 52
disclosed herein, can be administered to a cell, an animal or a human patient per se, or in
pharmaceutical compositions where they are mixed with other active ingredients, as in
combination therapy, or suitable carriers or excipient(s), including stabilizers. Such carriers,
excipients or stabilizers are usually pharmaceutically acceptable in that they are nontoxic to the
cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages and concentrations employed. Often the
physiologically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH buffered solution. Examples of
physiologically acceptable carriers include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic
acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues)
polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers
such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or
lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or
dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt
forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN@,
polyethylene glycol (PEG), and PLURONICS@. Exemplary routes include, but are not limited
to, oral, transdermal, and parenteral delivery.
    [189] Suitable routes of administration may, for example, include depot, oral, rectal,
transmucosal, or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular,
subcutaneous, intravenous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct
intraventricular, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections.
    [190] Alternately, one may administer the compound or combination in a local rather than
systemic manner, for example, via injection of the compound or combination directly into a
tissue, often in a depot or sustained release formulation.
    [191] Furthermore, one may administer the drug in a targeted drug delivery system, for
example, in a liposome coated with a tumour-specific antibody. The liposomes will be targeted to
and taken up selectively by the tumour.
    [192] A pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein includes a compound or combination
as defined above. Such a pharmaceutical composition may be manufactured in a manner that is
itself known, e. g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making,
levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes.
    [193] Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention thus
may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers
including excipients and auxiliaries that facilitate processing of the active compound or
combination into preparations that can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is
dependent upon the route of administration chosen.

                                                  53
    [194]   For injection, the agents disclosed herein may be formulated in aqueous solutions, for
instance in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks's solution, Ringer's solution, or
physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier
to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.
    [195]   For oral administration, the compound or combination can be formulated readily by
combining the compound or combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known
in the art. Such carriers enable the compound or combination disclosed herein to be formulated as
a tablet, pills, dragee, capsule, liquid, gel, syrup, slurry or suspension, for oral ingestion by a
patient to be treated.
    [196]   Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by adding a solid excipient,
optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding
suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in
particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose
preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin,
gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium
carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).
    [197]   If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl
pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate.
    [198]   Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar
solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,
carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable
organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee
coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound or
combination doses.
[199] Pharmaceutical preparations that can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of
gelatine, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatine and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or
sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as
lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and,
optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compound or combination may be dissolved or
suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In
addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages
suitable for such administration. For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form
of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.
    [200]   For administration by inhalation, the compound or combination for use as disclosed
herein is conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized

                                                 54
packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane,
trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the
case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a
metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of e. g. gelatine for use in an inhaler or insufflator may
be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound or combination and a suitable powder
base such as lactose or starch.
    [201] The compound or combination may be formulated for parenteral administration by
injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be
presented in unit dosage form, e. g., in ampules or in multi-dose containers, with an added
preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in
oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing
and/or dispersing agents.
    [202] Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of
the active compound or combination in water-soluble form. Additionally, a suspension of the
active compound or combination may be prepared as an appropriate oily injection suspension.
Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty
acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions
may contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium
carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain
suitable stabilizers or agents that increase the solubility of the compound or combination to allow
for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.
    [203] Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a
suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. The compound or combination may
also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g.,
containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.
    [204] In addition to the formulations described previously, the compound or combination
may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be
administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by
intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compound or combination may be formulated
with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable
oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly
soluble salt.
    [205] A pharmaceutical carrier for a hydrophobic compound or combination disclosed herein
is a co-solvent system including benzyl alcohol, a non-polar surfactant, a water-miscible organic
polymer, and an aqueous phase. The co-solvent system may be the VPD co-solvent system. VPD

                                                  55
is a solution of 3% w/v benzyl alcohol, 8% w/v of the non-polar surfactant polysorbate 80, and
65% w/v polyethylene glycol 300, made up to volume in absolute ethanol. The VPD co-solvent
system (VPD: D5W) consists of VPD diluted 1:1 with a 5% dextrose in water solution.
    [206] This co-solvent system dissolves hydrophobic compound or combination well, and
itself produces low toxicity upon systemic administration. Naturally, the proportions of a co
solvent system may be varied considerably without destroying its solubility and toxicity
characteristics.
    [207]   Furthermore, the identity of the co-solvent components may be varied: for example,
other low-toxicity non-polar surfactants may be used instead of polysorbate 80; the fraction size
of polyethylene glycol may be varied; other biocompatible polymers may replace polyethylene
glycol, e.g. polyvinyl pyrrolidone; and other sugars or polysaccharides may substitute for
dextrose.
    [208]   Other delivery systems for hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds may also be
employed. Liposomes and emulsions are well known examples of delivery vehicles or carriers
for hydrophobic drugs. Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide also may be
employed, although usually at the cost of greater toxicity. Additionally, the compound or
combination may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semipermeable matrices
of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various types of sustained
release materials have been established and are well known by those skilled in the art. Sustained
release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compound or combination
for a few weeks up to over 100 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the biological
stability of the therapeutic reagent, additional strategies for protein stabilization may be
employed.
    [209]   The pharmaceutical compositions also may include suitable solid or gel phase carriers
or excipients.
    [210]   Examples of such carriers or excipients include but are not limited to calcium
carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatine, and
polymers such as polyethylene glycols.
    [211]   Many of the compounds that may be used in the context of the invention may be
provided as salts with pharmaceutically compatible counter-ions. Pharmaceutically compatible
salts may be formed with many acids, including but not limited to hydrochloric, sulfuric, acetic,
lactic, tartaric, malic, succinic, etc. Salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous or other protonic
solvents that are the corresponding free base forms.

                                                  56
    [212]   Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the context of the present invention
include compositions where the active ingredients are contained in an amount effective to
achieve its intended purpose. More specifically, a therapeutically effective amount means an
amount of compound effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of disease or prolong
the survival of the subject being treated. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is
well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure
provided in this document.
    [213]   For any compound used in the methods disclosed herein, the therapeutically effective
dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. For example, a dose can be formulated in
animal models to achieve a circulating concentration range that includes the IC50 as determined
in cell culture (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal
inhibition of the kinase activity). Such information can be used to more accurately determine
useful doses in humans.
    [214]   Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the compound or combination described herein
can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental
animals, e.g., for determining the LD 5 0 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED 5 0
(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and
therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD 5 0 and
ED 50 - It may be desired to use a compound or combination that exhibit high therapeutic indices.
The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a
range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compound or combination lies preferably
within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED 5 0 with little or no toxicity. The
dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of
administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen
by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition.
    [215]   Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of
the active moiety, which are sufficient to maintain the kinase modulating effects, or minimal
effective concentration (MEC). The MEC will vary for each compound or combination but can
be estimated from in vitro data; e.g., the concentration necessary to achieve 50-90% inhibition of
the kinase. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and
route of administration. However, HPLC assays or bioassays can be used to determine plasma
concentrations.
    [216]   Dosage intervals can also be determined using MEC value. Compounds should be
administered using a regimen that maintains plasma levels above the MEC for 10-90% of the
time, for example from about 30 to about 90%, such as from about 50 to about 90%. In cases of

                                                57
local administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be
related to plasma concentration. The amount of composition administered will, of course, be
dependent on the subject being treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the affliction, the
manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician.
    [217]   The compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device, which
may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may for
instance include metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be
accompanied by instructions for administration. The pack or dispenser may also be accompanied
with a notice associated with the container in a form prescribed by a governmental agency
regulating the manufacture, use, or sale of pharmaceuticals, which notice is reflective of approval
by the agency of the form of the compound for human or veterinary administration. Such notice,
for example, may be the labelling approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration or other
government agency for prescription drugs, or the approved product insert.

also be prepared, placed in an appropriate container, and labelled for treatment of an indicated

    [219]   As explained above, the present invention inter alia encompasses the diagnostic,
prognostic, and therapeutic use of an immunoglobulin or proteinaceous binding molecule capable
of binding to and modulating the activity of a S1 00A8 protein and/or a S1 00A9 protein. Based on

EXAMPLES
    [226] Using standard techniques known in the art, the inventors expressed the individual
human proteins Si 00A8 and Si 00A9 in recombinant form, and purified them. After generating
homodimers and heterodimers, they analysed the properties of the complexes. Fig. 1 illustrates
the stimulation of human monocytes for four hours with the indicated concentrations of (A)
recombinant human S100A8, recombinant human S100A9 or human S100A8/S100A9, and (B)
recombinant human S1 00A8/S 100A9, recombinant human S1 00A8/S 100A9 (N69A) or
S100A8/S100A9 (E78A). TNFa released into the culture medium was quantified by means of
ELISA.
    [227] While the homodimers showed activating properties on monocytes, the
heterotetrameric complex of s 100A8 and S1 00A9 did not show activating properties that would
be comparable to the individual components (Fig. 1A). By means of site directed mutagenesis,

                                              59
preventing the formation of (Si 00A8/S 100A9) 2 tetramers, the inventors found that the formation
of tetramers blocks certain amino acids that are important for binding to TLR4.
    [228]  Mutating specific amino acids in the second calcium binding EF hand in S100A9,
namely N69 and E78, causes an inhibition of tetramer formation. Further, this mutation leads to
an activation of monocytes that is comparable to the activation caused by homodimers (Fig. IB).
Accordingly, the activity of S1OOA8 and S100A9 is controlled by their oligomerisation state.
    [229]  Expression and purification of S100A8 and S100A9 proteins. For the expression of
recombinant (rec) proteins without additional peptide sequences, the cDNAs from wt S100A8,
wt S100A9 and the S100A9 EF-hand mutants were cloned into the pET11/20 vector [50-NdeI;
30-BamiHI]. Expression and isolation of the gene products was achieved in E. coli strain BL21
(DE3). Bacteria were grown at 37 'C in 2x YT for 24 h. Afterwards bacteria were harvested,
lysed and the inclusion bodies (IB) prepared. The IB pellet was dissolved in 8 M urea buffer and
to establish proper refolding samples were adjusted to pH 2.0-2.5 first by adding hydrochloric
acid. After 60 min incubation at room temperature, samples were stepwise dialyzed to get
adapted to pH 7.4 for refolding in the presence of 2 mM DTT. After centrifugation (10 min,
60,000g, 4'C) to pellet aggregated material, samples were further dialyzed and applied to anion
exchange column and gel filtration chromatography. To prepare heterodimeric complexes the
recombinant proteins were mixed 1:1 in equimolar concentrations first. Samples were stored as
stock solutions at -20 'C. Correct refolding and complex formation was assessed by SDS-PAGE,
CD spectroscopy, MALDI-MS and ESI-MS.
    [230]  The maximal endotoxin contamination in the S100 preparations was determined by
Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay (BioWhitaker, Walkersville, MD) and was lower than 1
pg LPS / gg S100 protein or could not be detected in the different batches. In addition
PolymyxinB (50 gg/ml; Sigma) was added to S100A8 in control experiments to exclude
stimulatory effects due to LPS contamination.
    [231]  Preparation and stimulation of monocytes. Monocytes were isolated from human
buffy coats by Ficoll- Paque and subsequent Percoll density centrifugation (Pharmacia, Freiburg,
Germany). Cells were cultured in Teflon bags (Biofolie 25; Heraeus Instruments, Hanau,
Germany) using McCoy's 5a medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum for 1 day before
stimulation. Monocytes were incubated for 4 hours with different dosis of hS1OOA8, hS1OOA9,
hS 100A8/S 100A9 or the modified proteins as indicated in the figures and TNF-a concentrations
in supernatants were determined by ELISA (OptEIA, BD Biosciences, Germany).
    [232]  Determination of cytokine concentrations. Release of cytokine TNF-a was
measured in the culture supernatants by ELISA (OptEIA, BD Biosciences).

                                               60
    [233]   Using a computer-assisted approach based on the 3D structures of homodimer,
heterodimer and heterotetramer, which are known in the art, the inventors identified those amino
acids of Si 00A9 that are freely accessible in the homodimeric form and in the heterodimer of
S100A8 and S100A9, but that are blocked in the heterotetrameric form (S100A8/S100A9) 2 . They
found that predominantly amino acids located in the C-terminal EF hand, also termed EF hand II,
are involved (Fig. 2A). Certain of these amino acids, being amino acids not concurrently
involved in calcium binding, were subsequently selected for mutation studies (Fig. 2B, namely
the amino acids of positions of the human protein S1 00A9 of the Uniprot/Swissprot accession
number P06702 (version 147 as of 5 September 2012, SEQ ID NO: 77).
    [234]   Computer assisted ligand / receptor interaction studies: PDB files of Si00A8/A9
tetramer (PDB ID: 1XK4), S100A9 (PDB ID: 1IRJ) and S100A8 (PDB id: 1MR8) were retrieved
from RSCB PDB website. The S1 00A8/A9 pdb file was modified so that it contained only the E
and G chains resembling the heterodimer. The modified S1 00A8/A9 file was analysed using
computer modelling programs as Autodock (3D Computer modelling program), Pymol and
Swiss-PDBviewer to analyse the aminoacids which are free in the heterodimer or S100A9
homodimer but buried in the tetramer (interface analysis). We concentrated our analyses on the
identification of aminoacids that in addition are not involved in Ca++ binding and sterically free
for binding to TLR4. Amino acids in S100A9 (positions 64, 65, 72, 73, 77 and 85) were chosen
for mutation studies.
    [235]   Mutations at amino acid positions 64 (glutamic acid), 65 (aspartic acid), 73
(glutamine) and 77 (glutamic acid) caused a loss of function also for the S1 00A9 homodimer.
Mutations at amino acid positions 72 (lysine) and 85 (arginine) caused hardly any effect. These
studies with purified mutant proteins show that EF hand II is indeed responsible for the binding
to and the activation of TLR4.
    [236]   In a methodically independent parallel approach, S100A9 was partially digested with
trypsin. The obtained peptide fragments were examined with regard to their capability of still
activating monocytes. It was found that one or more fragments of S1 00A9 were apparently still
able to activate monocytes, even if as good as no intact S100A9 protein molecule was detectable
any more (Fig. 3A). The particular peptide was isolated by means of sepharose beads, to which
TLR4/MD2 had been coupled. The peptide was analysed by mass spectrometry. A peptide was
identified, which consisted of the amino acid sequence from positions 73 to 85 of S100A9. The
identified peptide coincided very well with the results of the computer-based simulation approach
and with the mutation studies.
    [237]   Tryptic digestion of human S100A9 homodimer: Immobilized TPCK Trypsin (25 gl
of settled gel, Pierce, Rockford) was used to digest 30 gg of human S100A9 at 37'C for different

                                               61
 time points as indicated in the figure and subsequently samples were centrifuged (5 min, 400xg)
 using a resin separator to remove trypsinbeads. Aliquots were taken from the centrifugate and
 either analysed by SDS-PAGE/WestemBlot or to stimulate human monocytes for 4 hours. TNF-a
 concentrations in supernatants of stimulated monocytes were determined by ELISA (OptEIA, BD
 Biosciences, Germany).
     [238] Western Blot analysis: Trypsin digested peptidic fragments of S100A9 were
 separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher
 and Schuell). Membranes were blocked with 5 % skim milk powder and subsequently probed
 with the primary antibody a-S 100A9 (rabbit, polyclonal, 1 gg/ml) over night at 4 'C. Afterwards
 bound primary antibody was detected with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti rabbit
 HRP) and developed with enhanced chemo luminescence system (ECL).
     [239] Immunoprecipitation studies to identify TLR4/MD2 binding peptides: Anti-His
 antibody (5 gL, 0,5 mg/mL, Invivogen) and his-tagged rhTLR4/MD2 (5 gL, 1 mg/mL, carrier
free, R&D    SYSTEMS)   were mixed and coupled to Protein A/G Agarose (50 gl, Pierce, Thermo
 Scientific). Trypsin digested peptides of S1OOA9 were added for 3 h at 4'C in the presence of 1
 mM Calcium. After washing of the beads in HBS/1mM Ca-buffer for three times bound peptidic
 fragments were eluted by addition of 10mM TRIS/2mM EDTA-buffer and analysed by ESI-QIT
 and MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry. Identical experiments were performed to analyze the
 binding of the chemical synthesized peptides of S100A9 (aa63-79), S100A8 (aa55-71) and the
 corresponding control peptides aa63-79 A5 and aa55-71 A3. A schematic of the
 immunoprecipitation test is shown in Fig. 3E.
     [240] In yet a further approach the inventors examined a synthetic peptide with a sequence
 corresponding to amino acid positions 63-79, i.e. the complete C-terminal EF hand
 (MEDLDTNADKQLSFEEF, molecular weight: 2032 g/mol) of S1OOA9 with regard to its
 binding to TLR4/MD2. A peptide with the sequence of amino acid positions 63-79 (63-79 5A,
 molecular weight: 1758 g/mol) of S1OOA9 served as a control, in which the four amino acids
 identified as most likely important for binding to TLR4/MD2 (E64A, D65A, Q73A and E77A,
 nomenclature of S1 00A9 maintained), and in addition amino acid K72A, had been exchanged to
 alanine. A comparison of Fig. 4A and Fig 4B shows clearly that only the non-mutant peptide (63
 79) is able to bind to TLR4/MD2. In contrast thereto, for the peptide with 5 mutant amino acids
 (63-79 A5) no binding could be detected, even in an enlargement on the Y axis (peak at 1758
 m/z).
     [241] In a parallel approach the inventors used mutants of S100A9, which contained
 mutations in the region supposedly involved in binding to TLR4/MD2. These S100A9 mutants
 were used in the form of purified proteins and contained one or two mutated amino acids, in that

                                                   62
one or two amino acids in the region of positions 63-79 were exchanged for an alanine. As can be
taken from Fig. 6B, the mutated proteins S100A9E64A, S100A9D65A, S100A9Q73A, and
Si 00A9E77A showed a weaker binding to the receptor when compared to non-mutated protein
(S100A9 wt). The mutated proteins S10A9K72A and S10A9R85A showed a binding that was not
significantly different from the wild type protein S1 00A9 (Fig. 6B). Mutated proteins of Si 00A9 that
contained an amino acid exchange at two positions when compared to the wild type protein showed an
almost complete loss of binding to the receptor. This observation further proves the importance of this
region of S1 00A9 and of amino acids E54, D65, Q73 and E77 for receptor interaction.
    [242]   Binding of S100A9 -wt and mutant proteins to TLR4/MD2: Binding of S100A9
proteins to TLR4/MD2 was analysed by a modified S1 00A9-ELISA. Briefly, TLR4/MD2 was
coupled to the wells of a 96-well plate and served as capturing molecule. After blocking of the
unspecific binding sites by PBS/5 % skim milk powder plates were washed three times. S100A9
wt or mutant S1 00A9 proteins were added at a concentration of 2 gg/ml each in the presence and
absence of 100gM Calcium and incubated for two hours at room temperature. Unbound S1 00A9
was removed by washing the plates for three times followed by the addition of a primary anti
S100A9-antibody (1 gg/ml, polyclonal, rabbit). After a washing step the secondary anti-rabbit
IgG-antibody coupled to HRP (1gg/ml from Cell Signalling) was added. TMB was used as
substrate for HRP to quantify binding by absorbance readings at 450 nm in an ELISA reader
(Anthos Mirkosysteme).
    [243]   Finally, the inventors analysed a synthetic peptide, having the amino acid sequence of
positions 55-71 of human S100A8 (Uniprot/Swissprot accession number P05 109, version 138 as
of 5 September 2012, SEQ ID NO: 78), i.e. the complete C-terminal EF hand
(FKELDINTDGAVNFQEF, molecular weight: 1990 g/mol) with regard to its binding to
TLR4/MD2. Again, a peptide with the sequence of amino acid positions 55-71 (55-71 3A,
molecular weight: 1815 g/mol) of S100A8 served as a control, in which those amino acids
identified as most likely important for binding to TLR4/MD2, analogously to S1 00A9, were
exchanged to alanine. Although the purity of the peptide was not optimal, a comparison of Fig.
5A and Fig. 5B shows that only the non-mutant peptide 55-71 (Fig. 5A) is able to bind to
TLR4/MD2. For the peptide with 3 mutant amino acids 55-71A3, however, no binding could be
detected, even in an enlargement on the Y axis (Peak with 1815 m/z).
    [244]   In summary, these data show that the C-terminal calcium binding hands, corresponding
to amino acid positions 63-79 of human S100A9 (MEDLDTNADKQLSFEEF, molecular weight: 2032
g/mol) and amino acid positions 55-71 of S100A8 (FKELDINTDGAVNFQEF, molecular weight: 1990
g/mol) mediate the interaction of the respective protein with TLR4.
