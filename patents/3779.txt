             This patent application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application
     No. 61/559,849, filed November 15, 2011, the entire contents of which are hereby

                                                    BACKGROUND
            Aseptic processing of cyclosporin A suspensions in a hyaluronic acid media
     (a hydrogel used as a suspending agent), is complicated by the fact that both the
     drug and the hyaluronic acid need to be pre-sterilized. Pre-sterilized hyaluronic
15   acid is extremely expensive, costing roughly $1 million dollars for a few kilograms
     (roughly $10,000 per ounce) of sterile raw material. Additionally, in the process of
     pre-sterilizing cyclosporin A, the drug is degraded upon irradiation, as shown
     below and in Figures 1 and 2:

    Additional levels of degradants need to be qualified in preclinical safety studies.
     Moreover, a suspension, prepared with only 90-95% of the labeled Cyclosporin A
     (due to the pre-sterilization process), has a substantial probability of failure to
     meet regulatory guidelines for shelf-life, since regulatory authorities generally
10   prohibit shelf-lives below 90% of label.
              The present invention solves these problems. Disclosed herein are
    formulations of cyclosporin A, combined with a parenterally-biocompatible
     suspending agent, which are sterile, exceptionally stable to heat sterilization, and
     have excellent long-term stability.

     Cyclosporin A Form 2
             Cyclosporin A is known to exist in an amorphous form, liquid crystal form,
     tetragonal crystalline form (form 1), and an orthorhombic form (form 3). A new
     crystalline form, cyclosporin A Form 2, has recently been discovered.
15           The XRPD pattern of CsA Form 2 differs significantly from the tetragonal
    form and orthorhombic form (FIG. 1). The major crystalline peaks for CsA form 2
     appear at (2e) when scanned by an X-ray diffractometer with X-ray source as Cu
     Ka radiation, A= 1.54 A, at 30 kV /15 mA: 7.5, 8.8, 10.2, 11.3, 12.7, 13.8, 14.5,
     15.6 and 17.5 (d-spacing in crystal lattice at about 11.8, 10.0, 8.7, 7.8, 7.0, 6.4,
20   6.1, 5.6 and 5.1A, respectively, Fig. 2). These major peaks are defined as those
     being unique to Form 2 relative to the orthorhombic or tetragonal forms; as well
     as, peaks having an intensity greater than 5 times the background.
             In one embodiment, the new crystalline form (Form 2) of CsA is a
     nonstoichiometric hydrate of Cyclosporin A. In another embodiment, the
25   crystalline Form 2 is represented by the formula:

 5          Form 2 appears to be a kinetically stable form of CsA in aqueous
     suspensions. Suspensions containing Form 2 show no conversion to other known
     polymorphic or pseudomorphic forms upon storage. It has been found that Form 1
     and the amorphous form convert to Form 2 in the presence of water.
            The single crystal structure of the hydrate form of CsA Form 2 has been
10   determined and the crystal structure parameters are listed in Table 2. These
     results indicate that Form 2 is unique compared to other known crystalline forms of
     cyclosporine A.

     The asymmetric unit of this CsA Form 2 contains one cyclosporine A molecule and
     two water molecules. It is possible that any small molecule that can hydrogen
     bond to water could play the role of space filler, which would give a range of
     potential structures running from the orthorhombic dihydrate to distorted
10   monoclinic dihydrate The XRPD pattern calculated from the single-crystal
     structure is shown in Figure 12 and it matches the experimental pattern shown in
     Figure 2. These matching patterns further corroborate that Form 2 is a unique and
     pure crystalline form of cyclosporine A.
                                                               6

   WO 2013/074616                                                     PCT/US2012/064998
             Without wishing to be bound by theory, thermogravimetric analysis
     combined with KF titration and vapor sorption desorption analysis (VSA) suggest
     that CsA Form 2 is a non-stoichiometric hydrate of CsA. The vapor sorption
     analysis of Cyclosporine Form 2 indicates that water content in the new crystal
 5  form reversibly varies with relative humidity as shown in Fig. 7. Similar to the
     tetragonal form, the new CsA form undergoes a phase transition to a liquid crystal
     or amorphous form at 124.4     0C prior to melting as indicated by the modulated
     differential calorimetric (MDSC) analysis (Figure 8).
             Cyclosporin A Form 2 may be obtained by suspending amorphous 0.05 %
10   cyclosporin A (w/v) in 1% Polysorbate 80, heating the solution to 65    0C,  holding it
     at that temperature for 24 hours, and then recovering the precipitate by vacuum
    filtration. One can then use the cyclosporin A Form 2 thus obtained to generate
     additional amounts, using Cyclosporin A Form 2 as a seed crystal; in this method,
     one suspends about 30 g cyclosporin A in a solution of 900 ml water containing
15   1% (w/v) Polysorbate 80, heats the solution to 65 C, and then seeds it with 0.2 g
     of cyclosporin A Form 2 at a temperature of 52 C. The solution is then stirred for
     about 22 hours at a temperature of between about 61       0C  and 65 C, and then
     recovers the precipitate that results.

20  Application No. 13/480,710, the entire contents of which are incorporated by

     Methods of preparation
             Suspensions of the invention contain cyclosporin A Form 2 and a
     suspending agent. In another embodiment, the suspension also contains one or
 5   more of water, buffer, and salt, in sufficient quantities to provide a biocompatible
    formulation. By "biocompatible," the inventors mean that the suspension is
     appropriate for administration to the eye (for example, by parenteral
     administration).
             The formulations of the invention may be manufactured by using either a
10   heat-sterilized slurry of Form 2 cyclosporin mixed aseptically with a sterile
     parenterally-biocompatible suspending agent and other excipient; or by combining
     Form 2 cyclosporin with a parenterally-biocompatible suspending agent and other
     excipients and heat sterilizing the entire formulation.
             These methods address various important problems with cyclosporin
15  formulation: 1) solid cyclosporin cannot be pre-sterilized by irradiation without
     significant drug degradation and formation of degradation products; 2) sterile
    filtration is also not feasible because the formulation is a suspension; and 3)
     terminal sterilization by heat will decrease gel viscosity. Also, in one embodiment,
                                                 11

   WO 2013/074616                                                       PCT/US2012/064998
     the final viscosity of the drug formulation is sufficiently high to keep the cyclosporin
     suspended throughout the product's shelf-life. In another embodiment, the
     viscosity is sufficiently low to permit the final formulation to flow through a narrow
     gauge syringe, such as a 22, 23, 24, 25, or 26 gauge needle or narrower. In still
 5   another embodiment, the formulation is sufficiently high to keep the cyclosporin
     suspended throughout the product's shelf-life, and also sufficiently low to permit
     the final formulation to flow through a syringe with a 22, 23, 24, 25, or 26 gauge
     needle or narrower.
             Methods 1 and 2, below, use hyaluronic acid as the suspending agent but,
10   other suitable suspending agents may be substituted.
              It should be noted that sterile hyaluronic acid is very expensive and that
     method 2 provides a unique method of sterilization, which allows the use of non
     sterile hyaluronic acid by heat-reducing the polymer to the correct molecular
    weight range, so that it reaches the target viscosity range. Method 2, therefore,
15   requires precision manufacturing, where each new lot of hyaluronic acid may shift
     to a different viscosity range, under identical manufacturing conditions.
     Consequently, in order to assure the correct viscosity range is reached in every
     commercial batch, the heat cycle will need to be adaptive-that is-adjusted
     according to a set of guidelines and experiments on the raw material lot prior to
20   manufacture of the drug product.
             Furthermore, it should be noted that Method 2 prepares all steps of the
    formulation in a single vessel. These two methods allow for the rapid production
     of the drug product and consequently, have substantial value in saving one day or
     more of valuable manufacturing time over Method 1.
25           These methods depend on the inventors' surprising discovery that
     cyclosporin A Form 2 may be autoclaved and still retain its potency and stability.
     Other forms of cyclosporin - amorphous, Form 1 and Form 3 - cannot be
     autoclaved, without unacceptable loss of drug substance from the suspension.
30   Method I - aqueous slurry method
             The appropriate amount of cyclosporin A Form 2 is suspended and mixed
     in phosphate buffered saline solution and the slurry is heat sterilized by autoclave.
     In an aseptic environment, the appropriate amount of pre-sterilized hyaluronic acid
     is added to the sterile cyclosporin slurry, is mixed, and then dissolved. The drug
                                                  12

   WO 2013/074616                                                       PCT/US2012/064998
     product is brought to volume with sterile water for injection. The final product has
     a viscosity in the correct range to create a long-term stable suspension, while
     allowing the final formulation to flow through a syringe fitted with a narrow-gauge
     needle, such as 25 gauge needle or narrower.
 5
     Method 2 - single vessel method
             An excess of non-sterile hyaluronic acid is dissolved in phosphate buffered
     saline solution. Cyclosporin A Form 2 is suspended and mixed. The resulting
     suspension formulation is heat-sterilized by autoclave (using an "adaptive" heat
10   cycle), at the appropriate temperature and for the appropriate amount of time, to
     both sterilize the formulation and bring the viscosity into the desired range.
              For parenteral formulations, it may be desirable to achieve a viscosity that
     is sufficiently high to keep the cyclosporin suspended throughout the product's
     shelf-life, and also sufficiently low to permit the final formulation to flow through a
15   syringe with a 22, 23, 24, 25, or 26 gauge needle or narrower. While hydrogel
     solutions are generally recognized as safe for topical use, very few have been
     used for parenteral administration, and none have been demonstrated to be safely
     injected through a 25 gauge needle (or narrower) into subconjunctival tissue at
     high hydrogel concentrations. A high concentration of suspending agent (up to
20   25%) is necessary in order to maintain the suspendability of the 5-40% cyclosporin
     parenteral formulations described herein. In one embodiment, parenteral
    formulations for use in subconjunctival tissue are (1) injectable through a narrow
     gauge needle, such as 25 gauge or narrower, in order to minimize tissue damage
     by the needle, to allow for quick healing of the needle entry-point, and to limit the
25   back-flow of the injected formulation; (2) sterile; (3) biocompatible; and (4)
     sufficiently viscous to maintain suspendability throughout the shelf-life of the
    formulation and to prevent tissue reflux out of the subconjunctival space. In such
    formulations viscosity is sufficiently high to retain long-term suspendability of the
     drug but sufficiently low to allow the entire formulation to readily pass through a
30   narrow gauge needle.
              In one embodiment of the invention, the formulations have a very high
     viscosity (e.g.,    100,000 cps) yet may still able to be injected out of syringe
     through a narrow-gauge needle. The following table gives examples of such
    formulations.

     Methods of treatment
 5            Compositions of the invention may be used to treat any condition of the eye
    which is known to be amenable to topical treatment with cyclosporin A (such as
    with Restasis@) at the concentrations stated here. For example, compositions of
     the invention may be used to treat patients suffering from dry eye, to treat
     blepharitis and meibomian gland disease, to restore corneal sensitivity that has
10   been impaired due to refractive surgery on the eye, to treat allergic conjunctivitis
     and atopic and vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and to treat ptyregia, conjunctival and
     corneal inflammation, keratoconjuntivitis, graft versus host disease, post
     transplant glaucoma, corneal transplants, mycotic keratitis, Thygeson's superficial
     punctate keratitis, uveitis, and Theodore's superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis,
15   among other conditions.
              The International Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) defines dry eye as "a
     multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms of
     discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to the
     ocular surface, accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and
20   inflammation of the ocular surface." It includes those conditions, such as
     keratoconjunctivitis sicca, that are caused by tear deficiency or excessive
     evaporation of tears.
              Blepharitis is a chronic disorder producing inflammation of the anterior and
     posterior lid margin, with involvement of skin and its related structures (hairs and
                                                 14

   WO 2013/074616                                                      PCT/US2012/064998
     sebaceous glands), the mucocutaneous junction, and the meibomian glands. It
     can also affect the conjunctiva, tear film, and the corneal surface in advanced
     stages and may be associated with dry eye. Blepharitis is commonly classified
     into anterior or posterior blepharitis, with anterior affecting the lash bearing region
 5   of the lids, and posterior primarily affecting the meibomian gland orifices.
             Meibomian gland disease most often occurs as one of three forms: primary
     meibomitis, secondary meibomitis, and meibomian seborrhea. Meibomian
     seborrhea is characterized by excessive meibomian secretion in the absence of
     inflammation (hypersecretory meibomian gland disease). Primary meibomitis, by
10   contrast, is distinguished by stagnant and inspissated meibomian secretions
     (obstructive hypersecretory meibomian gland disease). Secondary meibomitis
     represents a localized inflammatory response in which the meibomian glands are
     secondarily inflamed in a spotty fashion from an anterior lid margin blepharitis.
              Impaired corneal sensitivity often occurs after refractive surgery, such as
15   photorefractive keratectomy, laser assisted sub-epithelium keratomileusis
     (LASEK), EPI-LASEK, customized transepithelial non-contact ablation, or other
     procedures in which the corneal nerves are severed. Impaired corneal sensitivity
     may also occur after viral infection, such as by HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV viruses.
     Patients with impaired corneal sensitivity often complain that their eyes feel dry,
20   even though tear production and evaporation may be normal, suggesting that
     "dryness" in such patients is actually a form of corneal neuropathy that results
    when corneal nerves are severed by surgery or inflamed after viral infection.
             Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva resulting from
     hypersensitivity to one or more allergens. It may be acute, intermittent, or chronic.
25   It occurs seasonally, that is, at only certain time of the year, or it occurs
     perennially, that is, chronically throughout the year. Symptoms of seasonal and
     perennial allergic conjunctivitis include, in addition to inflammation of the
     conjunctiva, lacrimation, tearing, conjunctival vascular dilation, itching, papillary
     hyperlasia, chemosis, eyelid edema, and discharge from the eye. The discharge
30   may form a crust over the eyes after a night's sleep.
             Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is a chronic, severe form of allergic conjunctivitis
     that often leads to visual impairment. Symptoms include itching, burning, pain,
     redness, foreign body sensation, light sensitivity and blurry vision. There is often a
     discharge, especially on awakening from a night's sleep; the discharge may be
                                                 15

   WO 2013/074616                                                      PCT/US2012/064998
     stringy, ropy, and mucoid. The lower conjunctiva is often more prominently
     affected than the upper conjunctiva. The conjunctiva may range from pale,
     edematous, and featureless to having the characteristics of advanced disease,
     including papillary hypertrophy, subepithelial fibrosis, formix foreshortening,
 5   trichiasis, entropion, and madurosis. In some patients the disease progresses to
     punctate epithelial erosions, corneal neovascularization, and other features of
     keratopathy which may impair vision. There is typically goblet cell proliferation in
     the conjunctiva, epithelial pseudotubular formation, and an increased number of
     degranulating eosinophils and mast cells in the epithelium. CD25+T lymphocytes,
10   macrophages, and dendritic cells (HLA-DR.sup.+, HLA-CD1 +) are significantly
     elevated in the substantia propria.
             Like atopic keratoconjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis is a severe form
     of allergic conjunctivitis, but it tends to affect the upper conjunctiva more
     prominently than the lower. It occurs in two forms. In the palpebral form, square,
15   hard, flattened, closely packed papillae are present; in the bulbar (limbal) form, the
     circumcorneal conjunctiva becomes hypertrophied and grayish. Both forms are
     often accompanied by a mucoid discharge. Corneal epithelium loss may occur,
     accompanied by pain and photophobia, as may central corneal plaques and
     Trantas' dots.

                                             EXAMPLES
             The invention is further illustrated by the following examples.
             When the inventors autoclaved aqueous suspensions of cyclosporin A, the
25   drug particles aggregated, making the product unacceptable. Additionally, the
     inventors found that hyaluronic acid also degrades upon autoclaving, causing a
     marked drop in viscosity. Lower viscosity, in turn, reduces the suspendability of
     the drug particles and causes them to settle. Formulations having drug particles in
     suspension that too rapidly settle, or irreversibly settle, may be useful for
30   laboratory tests, but are not commercially viable.
             The inventors explored formulations of four cyclosporin A polymorphic
    forms, the amorphous form, the tetragonal crystalline form (form 1), the
     orthorhombic form (form 3), and cyclosporin A Form 2.
                                                  16

   WO 2013/074616                                                       PCT/US2012/064998
             A suspension of form 1 converts to the amorphous form and aggregates
     upon autoclaving; clumping of the cyclosporin is also observed. Consequently,
     neither form 1 nor the amorphous form is suitable for autoclave stabilization.
     Furthermore, an autoclaved suspension of F3 in water lost 11-28% of its potency
 5   during autoclaving (Table 4); this, too, is unacceptable. In contrast, a suspension
     of Form 2 in water was quite stable to autoclaving, resisting degredation when
     compared to a pre-sterilization control. X-ray analysis of filtered solid from the
     Form 2 formulation also confirms that Form 2 is polymorphically stable to
     autoclaving (Fig. 3). These latter two findings are extremely surprising,
10   considering the lack of either chemical or polymorphic stability of the other three
    forms.
             The inventors explored the autoclavability of a series of concentrated
     solutions of various polymers (no drug) which, when loaded in a syringe, will flow
     through a narrow-gauge needle (25 gauge or narrower). The polymers evaluated
15  were as follows: cross-linked hyaluronic acid (Juvederm@), carbomer,
     carboxymethylcellulose-medium molecular weight, carboxymethylcellulose-high
     molecular weight, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, Pluronic F1 27
     and polyvinylpyrrolidone K90. All of these are readily available from commercial
     suppliers.
20           One hundred microliters of each of the autoclaved solutions was injected
     into rabbit conjunctiva, in order to evaluate the propensity for causing
     inflammation. Those polymers producing an inflammatory reaction were eliminated
    from consideration (Figure 4, carbomer, both CMC's, and HPMC were eliminated).
    Additionally, Juvederm@ was eliminated because it formed a long-lasting bleb
25  which, in humans, might cause irritation as the eyelid moves over the site of
     injection. Both HPMC and Pluronic separated from the solution during/after
     autoclaving and consequently were also eliminated. Of the commercially viable
     hydrogels, only HEC and PVP demonstrated that they produced no inflammation
     in rabbit conjunctiva after autoclaving. These two hydrogels were used to
30  formulate cyclosporin A suspensions for further evaluation. The results of the
     studies are shown in Table 5.
             Initially, the inventors explored the possibility of heat-sterilizing a slurry of
     cyclosporin A of Form 1 (which converts to the amorphous form). This approach
     resulted in agglomeration of the drug and consequently, the formulation was not
                                                  17

     viable. Further studies, adding PVP to suppress the agglomeration of Form
     1/amorphous form, also failed.
               Since heat-sterilization of an aqueous suspension of cyclosporin did not
     appear to be viable, the inventors planned to prepare suspensions by aseptic
 5   technique, using pre-sterilize solid cyclosporin. Various solid cyclosporins (Forms
     1, 2, and 3 and amorphous) were treated with gamma or e-beam irradiation. In all
     cases, significant loss of drug (3-9%) occurred (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Furthermore,
     the substantial loss of drug indicates that high levels of degradation products
     (around 3-9%) are generated in the irradiation-sterilized material. These
10   impurities may have negative toxicological and/or regulatory implications;
     consequently, this approach to sterilization appears to be undesirable.

                After it became apparent that irradiation of solid cyclosporins produced too
     much degradation, the inventors attempted to irradiate an aqueous suspension of
     cyclosporin, using hyaluronic acid as a suspending agent. This approach resulted
 5   in 4-10% degradation of the drug within the formulation.
