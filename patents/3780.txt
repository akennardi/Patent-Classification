                           TYPES OF DATA ON A SINGLE PACKET
                                          ABSTRACT
Data recording systems (100) and methods (400) for synchronizing data of a plurality of
different data types on a single packet (300). The methods involve: receiving the data and an
audio frame containing voice data and timing data communicated over a plurality of channels;
generating, in response to the reception of the audio frame, a combined packet on which the
audio frame and at least a portion of the data are time synchronized to each other; and
substantially simultaneously storing the combined packet in a primary data store and a
secondary data store of a data recorder for subsequent use in reconstructing events leading
up to a crash of a land vehicle, aircraft or vessel. The portion of data may include data link
data, flight data and/or image/video data. The channels may include a cockpit channel and a
plurality of pilot channels.

 SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR SYNCHRONIZING VARIOUS TYPES OF DATA ON
                                        A SINGLE PACKET
                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Statement of the Technical Field
[0001]       The invention concerns data recording systems. More particularly, the invention
concerns data recording systems and methods for synchronizing data of a plurality of different
data types (e.g., audio data, data link data, flight data, and image/video data) on a single packet.
Description of the Related Art
[0002]       There are many conventional data recorders that are known in the art. Some of these
data recorders are Flight Data Recorders ("FDRs") designed to meet a Technical Standard Order
("TSO"). The TSO refers the performance specifications and design requirements to a
EUROCAE ED- 112 document. In the EUROCAE ED- 112 document, there is a requirement to
physically segregate various types of data that are being recorded in a data store of an FDR.
[0003]       The physical segregation is achieved by storing a particular type of data in a
respective memory chip of a plurality of memory chips of the data store. The data types include,
but are not limited to, voice data communicated over a cockpit channel, voice data
communicated over pilot channels, flight data, data link data, and image/video data. The flight
data includes, but is not limited to, engine speed data, wing flap position data, aileron position
data and ruder position data. The data link data includes, but is not limited to, data defining
information sent between an aircraft and an air traffic controller. Such information includes, but
is not limited to, location information, speed information, altitude information, traffic instruction
information, direction information, targeting information, control information and/or telemetry
information.
[0004]       The physically segregation of data provides a high degree of assurance that at least
some of the data types would be recoverable in the event of a crash. For example, if a memory
chip of the data store is damaged during a crash, then only one type of data would not be
recoverable. In this scenario, the other types of data could be recovered and used to reconstruct
                                                 1

      WO 2013/006210                                                           PCT/US2012/024047
the events leading up to the crash since the memory chips in which these other types of data were
stored were not damaged during the crash.
[0005]      In order to reconstruct the events leading up to a crash, the recoverable data needs to
be synchronized to each other. This synchronization is typically performed by analyzing content
of the recoverable data manually by an operator or automatically by a software program.
Notably, the manual synchronization process is time consuming and costly. The automatic
synchronization process is relatively complex and computationally intensive.
                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006]      Embodiments of the present invention concern implementing systems and methods
for synchronizing data of a plurality of different data types (e.g., data link data, flight data, and
image/video data) on a single packet. The methods involve receiving the data and an audio
frame by a data recorder. The audio frame contains voice data and timing data communicated
over a plurality of channels (e.g., a cockpit channel and a plurality of pilot channels). In
response to the reception of the audio frame, the data recorder generates a combined packet using
the audio frame and at least a portion of the data. The combined packet is generated by
encapsulating a packet payload with a packet header including a common clock time tag. The
common clock time tag provides a means for time synchronizing the audio frame and the portion
of data on the combined packet. The combined packet is then substantially simultaneously
stored in a primary data store and a secondary data store of the data recorder. The stored
combined packet may then be subsequently used in reconstructing events leading up to a crash of
a land vehicle, aircraft or vessel.
[0007]      According to aspects of the present invention, the packet header comprises
information specifying at least one of the plurality of different data types, a current power up
counter value, a packet number from a last power up, a number of milliseconds since a last time
tag generation, a size of the audio frame, and a size of each type of data which has been buffered
by the data recorder during a last "N" (e.g., 40) milliseconds. The packet header may also
comprise at least one of rotor speed data, Greenwich mean time data, data specifying a time of a
last erasure of memory, and/or data specifying a data rate of inputs to the data recorder.

[0008]      According to other aspects of the present invention, the packet payload comprises the
audio frame and the portion of data. The portion of data comprises data link and timing data
which was buffered by the data recorder during a last "N" (e.g., 40) milliseconds, flight and
timing data which was buffered by the data recorder during a last "N" (e.g., 40) milliseconds,
and an "N" (e.g., 40) millisecond fraction of a video frame defined by image/video and timing
data buffered by the data recorder.

                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0017]       The present invention is described with reference to the attached figures. The figures
are not drawn to scale and they are provided merely to illustrate the instant invention. Several
aspects of the invention are described below with reference to example applications for
illustration. It should be understood that numerous specific details, relationships, and methods
are set forth to provide a full understanding of the invention. One having ordinary skill in the
relevant art, however, will readily recognize that the invention can be practiced without one or
more of the specific details or with other methods. In other instances, well-known structures or
operation are not shown in detail to avoid obscuring the invention. The present invention is not
limited by the illustrated ordering of acts or events, as some acts may occur in different orders
and/or concurrently with other acts or events. Furthermore, not all illustrated acts or events are
required to implement a methodology in accordance with the present invention.
[0018]       The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or
illustration. Any aspect or design described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be
construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs. Rather, use of the word
exemplary is intended to present concepts in a concrete fashion. As used in this application, the
term "or" is intended to mean an inclusive "or" rather than an exclusive "or". That is, unless
specified otherwise, or clear from context, "X employs A or B" is intended to mean any of the
natural inclusive permutations. That is if, X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and
B, then "X employs A or B" is satisfied under any of the foregoing instances.
[0019]       The present invention concerns implementing systems and methods for synchronizing
a plurality of different types of data on a single packet. The methods generally involve receiving
the data and an audio frame by a data recorder. The audio frame contains voice data and timing
data communicated over a plurality of channels. In response to the reception of the audio frame,
the data recorder generates a combined packet using the audio frame and at least a portion of the
data. The combined packet is generated by encapsulating a packet payload with a packet header
including a common clock time tag. The common clock time tag provides a means for time
synchronizing the audio frame and the portion of data on the combined packet. The combined
packet is then substantially simultaneously stored in a primary data store and a secondary data

     WO 2013/006210                                                           PCT/US2012/024047
store of the data recorder. The stored combined packet may then be subsequently used in
reconstructing events leading up to a crash of a land vehicle, aircraft or vessel
[0020]       Notably, the present invention overcomes various drawbacks of conventional data
recorders. For example, the present invention provides a way to synchronize data which does
not require a manual or automatic data synchronization process to be performed after a crash. As
such, the present invention provides a data synchronization process that is less time consuming,
costly, complex and computationally intensive as compared to conventional data synchronization
processes (such as those described above in the background section of this document). Also, the
present invention employs less memory devices as compared to conventional data recorders.
Accordingly, the present invention has a lower circuit complexity, higher inherent reliability and
improved storage latency as compared to those of conventional data recorders.
[0021]       The present invention can be used in a variety of applications. Such applications
include, but are not limited to, flight data recorder applications, voyage data recorder
applications and land vehicle data recorders. Exemplary implementing system embodiments of
the present invention will be described below in relation to FIGS. 1-3C. Exemplary method
embodiments of the present invention will be described below in relation to FIGS. 4-5. The
present invention will be described below in relation to data recorders for aircrafts. The
invention is not limited in this regard. For example, the present invention can also be used with
data recorders for vessels and land vehicles.
Exemplary Systems Implementing The Present Invention
[0022]       Referring now to FIG. 1, there is provided a perspective view of a commercial aircraft
100 that implements the present invention. The aircraft 100 is generally a vehicle that is able to
fly by being supported by air. The aircraft 100 counters the force of gravity by using the
downward thrust from engines. Accordingly, the aircraft 100 comprises a nose section 104, a
cockpit 106, a fuselage or airframe 110, a tail section 120, wings 132 and engines 130.
[0023]       A Flight Data Acquisition Unit (FDAU) 102 is positioned in the nose section 104 of
the aircraft 100 to acquire flight information from corresponding sensors located throughout the
aircraft 100. Such flight information can include, but is not limited to, air speed, altitude, vertical
                                                5

     WO 2013/006210                                                            PCT/US2012/024047
acceleration, time, magnetic heading, control-column position, rudder-pedal position, control
wheel position, wing flap position, horizontal stabilizer, fuel flow and landing gear position.
FDAUs 102 are well known in the art, and therefore will not be described in detail herein.
[0024]       Sensors are placed on critical surfaces and system components of the aircraft 100 to
convert real-time physical flight measurements into electrical signals for the FDAU 102. Typical
aircraft sensors include an engine speed sensor 128, a wing flap position sensor 124, an aileron
position sensor 126 and a rudder position sensor 118. The aircraft sensors 118 and 124-128 can be
connected to the FDAU 102 through a fly-by-wire data bus 134 or wireless channel. The aircraft
sensors 118 and 124-128 are well known in the art, and therefore will not be described in detail
herein.
[0025]       An Audio/Video Recorder (AVR) 108 is provided in the aircraft 100 to collect other
flight related information, such as audio data, video data and associated timing data. The AVR
108 can be located in the cockpit, passenger area, cargo hold or landing gear compartment of the
aircraft 100. AVRs 108 are well known in the art, and therefore will not be described in detail
herein.
[0026]       The FDAU 102 and AVR 108 route flight related information to a Data Recorder (DR)
122 via the data bus 134, direct link or wireless transmission. DR 122 is mounted to the airframe
110, typically in the tail section of the aircraft to maximize survivability. DR 122 is applicable to
fixed wing and rotor aircraft, including commercial jets, military aircraft, drones, ultra-light
aircraft, blimps, balloons and flying wings. The DR 122 can also be adapted to marine trans
portation systems such as boats, submarines, hovercraft, also spanning to pleasure/recreational,
scientific, commercial, land-based vehicles and space travel. Further details of the DR 122 are
shown in FIG. 2.
[0027]       FIG. 2 is a detailed block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of the DR 122 that is
useful for understanding the present invention. As shown in FIG. 2, the DR 122 comprises a
plurality of components 204-270, which may be implemented as hardware (e.g., an electronic
circuit), software and/or a combined thereof. The components include a system interface 210, a
processor 212, at least one audio/video circuit 208, an Onboard Maintenance System (OMS) 232,
a system bus 230, a memory device 214 connected to and accessible by other portions of the DR

      WO 2013/006210                                                        PCT/US2012/024047
122 through system bus 230, a buffer 270, a common clock 206, hardware entities 228 connected
to system bus 230, and a locator beacon 216. The DR 122 can include more or less components
than those shown in FIG. 2. However, the components shown are sufficient to disclose an
illustrative embodiment implementing the present invention. The hardware architecture of FIG.
2 represents one embodiment of a representative DR configured to generate a combined packet
in which a plurality of different types of data are synchronized. As such, the DR 122 implements
method embodiments of the present invention. Exemplary method embodiments will be
described in detail below in relation to FIGS. 4-5.
[0028]       System interface 210 allows the DR 122 to communicate directly or indirectly with
external devices, such as the FDAU 102 of FIG. 1 and the AVR 108 of FIG. 1. During operation
of the DR 122, the system interface 210 receives various types of data communicated thereto by
the external devices over the data bus 134 of FIG. 1. The data includes, but is not limited to,
flight and timing data 280, data link and timing data 282, image/video and timing data 284, pilot
channel audio and timing data 286, cockpit channel and timing data 288, and rotor speed data
290. This received data is then sent from the system interface 210 to the buffer 270 for
temporary storage therein. The buffered data is used in a subsequent common packet generation
process. An exemplary common packet generation process will be described below in relation to
FIGS. 4-5.
[0029]       Processor 212 can be programmed for facilitating the common packet generation
operations of the present invention. In this regard, it should be understood that the processor 212
can access and run packet generation applications (not shown in FIG. 2) and other types of
applications installed on the DR 122. The packet generation applications are operative to
facilitate the synchronization of various types of data 280-290 on a single common packet,
storing the common packet in the primary data store 260 of the memory device 214, and storing
a redundant copy of the common packet in the secondary data store 262 of the memory device
214. The structure of the common packet will be described in detail below in relation to FIGS.
3A-3C. Still, it should be noted that the common packet includes a common clock time tag
generated using common clock 206. The common clock time tag provides a common clock
reference for the various types of data 280-290 contained in the common packet.

[0030]      The OMS 232 is programmed to facilitate health monitoring operations of the DR
122. In this regard, it should be understood that the OMS 232 can access and run health
monitoring applications (not shown in FIG. 2) and other types of applications installed on the DR
122. The health monitoring applications are operative to report the health of the DR 122 to
external devices (e.g., a computing device in the cockpit 106 of the aircraft 100 of FIG. 1) for
analysis. A health report for the DR 122 can include, but is not limited to, the following
information: an identifier; a date of manufacture; an expiration date; and/or at least one detected
condition thereof. The OMS 232 may provide said health reports on a periodic basis (e.g., once
per second).
[0031]      Hardware entities 228 can include microprocessors, Application Specific Integrated
Circuits (ASICs) and other hardware. At least some of the hardware entities 228 perform actions
involving access to and use of memory device 214 and buffer 270. Memory device 214 can be a
Random Access Memory (RAM), a disk driver and/or a Compact Disc Read Only Memory (CD
ROM). In this regard, the hardware entities 228 comprise a computer-readable storage medium
280 on which is stored one or more sets of instructions 250 (e.g., software code) configured to
implement one or more of the methodologies, procedures, or functions described herein. The
instructions 250 can also reside, completely or at least partially, within the memory device 214,
the processor 212, and/or the OMS 232 during execution thereof by the DR 122. The
components 214, 212, 232 also can constitute machine-readable media. The term "machine
readable media", as used here, refers to a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or
distributed database, and/or associated caches and servers) that store the one or more sets of
instructions 250. The term "machine-readable media", as used here, also refers to any medium
that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying a set of instructions 250 for execution by the DR
122 and that cause the DR 122 to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present
disclosure.
[0032]      As shown in FIG. 2, the locator beacon 216 is disposed internal to the DR 122. More
particularly, the locator beacon 216 is mechanically coupled to an inner surface of the housing
204 of the DR 122 via a mounting bracket 218. The mounting bracket 218 may comprise a
removable retaining plate for facilitating the placement of the locator beacon 216 in the
mounting bracket 218 and for retaining the locator beacon 216 within the mounting bracket 218.

Embodiments of the present invention are not limited in this regard. For example, the locator
beacon 216 can be disposed external to the DR 122. In this scenario, the locator beacon 216 can
be mechanically coupled to an outer surface of the housing 204 via mounting bracket 218.
However, there are many known advantages of locating the locator beacon 216 internal to the
DR 122.
[0033]       Notably, the DR 122 includes less data stores than conventional data recorders. In
this regard, it should be understood that conventional data recorders typically comprise one or
more data stores for each type of data 280-288 so that each type of data can be stored separate
from other types of data as required by the EUROCAE ED- 112 document. In contrast, the DR
122 only includes two (2) data stores, namely a primary data store 260 for storing common
packets and a second data store 262 for storing redundant copies of the common packets. As a
consequence of reducing the number of data stores, the DR 122 has a lower circuit complexity,
higher inherent reliability and improved storage latency as compared to that of conventional data
recorders.
[0034]       Referring now to FIGS. 3A-3C, there is provided a schematic illustration of an
exemplary combined packet 300 that is useful for understanding the present invention. As
shown in FIG. 3A, the combined packet 300 comprises a packet header 302 and a packet payload
304. A schematic illustration of the packet header 302 is provided in FIG. 3B. A schematic
illustration of the packet payload 304 is provided in FIG. 3C.
[0035]       As shown in FIG. 3B, the packet header 302 comprises a common clock time tag 306
and various other information 308-318. Such information can include, but is not limited to,
information 308 specifying a number of milliseconds since a last time tag generation,
information 310 specifying the types of data contained in the packet payload 304, information
312 specifying a size of each piece of data 280-288 contained in the packet payload 304,
information 314 specifying a current power up counter value, information 316 specifying a
packet number from a last power up, and/or information 318 specifying a status of the DR 122.
Optional information 320 may also be included in the packet header 302. The optional
information 320 can include, but is not limited to, rotor speed data 290, a Greenwich mean time
data, data specifying a time of a last erasure of memory, and/or data specifying a data rate of
inputs to the DR 122. Notably, the order in which the data components 306-320 are arranged
                                               9

      WO 2013/006210                                                          PCT/US2012/024047
within the packet header 302 is not limited to that shown in FIG. 3B. The data components 360
320 can be arranged in any order selected in accordance with a particular DR 122 application.
[0036]       As shown in FIG. 3C, the packet payload 304 comprises various types of data 280
288. The data includes, but is not limited to, cockpit channel audio and timing data 288, pilot
channel-I audio and timing data 2861, pilot channel audio and timing data 2862, pilot channel-3
audio and timing data 2863, flight and timing data 280, data link and timing data 282, and
image/video and timing data 284. Each of the listed types of data 280-288 is well known in the
art, and therefore will not be described herein. Notably, the order in which the data components
280-288 are arranged within the packet payload 304 is not limited to that shown in FIG. 3B. The
data components 280-288 can be arranged in any order selected in accordance with a particular
DR 122 application.
[0037]       Although each of the data portions 280-288 of the packet payload 304 includes its
own timing data generated using a respective clock of a plurality of different clocks, the data
portions 280-288 are synchronized to each other via the time tag 306 contained in the packet
header 302. As noted above, the time tag 306 is generated using a common clock 206 of the DR
122. Accordingly, the common packet 300 provides a means for synchronizing various types of
data 280-288 on a single packet. This single packet synchronization means provides a DR 122
which overcomes various drawbacks of conventional data recorders. For example, conventional
manual or complex automated methods are no longer required to synchronize the various types
of data 280-288 to each other after a crash. As such, the single packet synchronization means
facilitates the provision of a data synchronization process that is less time consuming, costly and
computationally intensive as compared to conventional data synchronization processes (such as
those described above in the background section of this document).
[0038]       As noted above, the DR 122 implements methods for synchronizing various types of
data on a common packet (e.g., common packet 300 of FIGS. 3A-3C). These methods involve
generating a common packet (e.g., common packet 300 of FIGS. 3A-3C) using various types of
data 280-290 received by the DR 122 during operation of the aircraft 100, storing the common
packet in a primary data store 260 of the DR 122, and storing a redundant copy of the common
                                              10

      WO 2013/006210                                                          PCT/US2012/024047
packet in a secondary data store 262 of the DR 122. Such methods will be described below in
relation to FIGS. 4-5.
Exemplary Methods of The Present Invention
[0039]       Referring now to FIG. 4 there is provided a flow diagram of an exemplary method
400 for synchronizing various types of data on a single common packet (e.g., common packet
300 of FIGS. 3A-3C) that is useful for understanding the present invention. As shown in FIG. 4,
the method 400 begins with step 402 and continues with step 404. In step 404, data link and
timing data is received by a data recorder (e.g., data recorder 122 of FIGS. 1-2). Thereafter, the
data recorder stores the received data link and timing data in an internal buffer (e.g., buffer 270
of FIG. 2), as shown by step 406. In a next step 408, the data recorder receives flight and timing
data. The flight and timing data is also stored in the internal buffer, as shown by step 410. The
data recorder also receives image/video and timing data in step 412. The image/video and timing
data is stored in the internal buffer in step 414.
[0040]       After completing step 414, the method 400 continues with step 416. Step 416
involves receiving, by the data recorder, an audio frame containing cockpit channel audio and
timing data, pilot channel-I audio and timing data, pilot channel-2 audio and timing data, and
pilot channel-4 audio and timing data. Notably, every "N" (e.g., 40) milliseconds an audio frame
is received by the data recorder. In response to the reception of the audio frame, step 418 is
performed where the data recorder generates a combined packet (e.g., combined packet 300 of
FIGS. 3A-3C). The combined packet is generated using the audio frame and at least a portion of
the data stored in the internal buffer in steps 406, 410 and 414. The process for generating the
combined packet will be described in detail below in relation to FIG. 5.
[0041]       In a next step 420, the data recorder performs operations to store the combined packet
in a primary data store (e.g., primary data store 260 of FIG. 2) and a secondary data store (e.g.,
secondary data store 262 of FIG. 2) thereof. The combined packet can be stored in the two (2)
data stores substantially simultaneously. Upon completing step 420, step 422 is performed
where the method 400 ends or other processing is performed. The other processing can involve
repeating some or all of the method steps 404-420 every "N" (e.g., 40) milliseconds.

      WO 2013/006210                                                           PCT/US2012/024047
[0042]       Referring now to FIG. 5, there is provided a flow diagram of an exemplary process
for generating a common packet that is useful for understanding the present invention. The
process of FIG. 5 can be performed in step 418 of FIG. 4. As shown in FIG. 5, the process
begins with step 502 and continues with step 504. In step 504, the data recorder (e.g., data
recorder 122 of FIGS. 1-2) generates a common clock time tag. Thereafter in step 506, the data
recorder obtains various information. The information includes, but is not limited to,
information specifying the types of data to be contained in a packet payload (e.g., packet payload
304 of FIGS. 3A and 3C), a status of a data recorder, a current power up counter value, a packet
number from a last power up, a number of milliseconds since a last time tag generation, a size of
the audio frame, and/or sizes of the data link data, flight data and image video data which has
been buffered during the last "N" (e.g., 40) milliseconds. In a next step 508, the data recorder
may optionally obtain rotor speed data, Greenwich mean time data, data defining a time of a last
erasure of memory, and/or data defining a data rate of inputs to the data recorder.
[0043]       After the completion of step 506 or 508, step 510 is performed where the data
recorder generates a packet header (e.g., packet header 302 of FIGS. 3A and 3B). The packet
header is generated using the common clock time tag, the information obtained in step 506
and/or the optional data obtained in step 508. Next, the data recorder generates a packet payload
(e.g., the packet payload 304 of FIGS. 3A and 3C), as shown by step 512. The packet payload is
generated by combining the audio frame received in step 416 of FIG. 4, the data link and timing
data which was buffered in step 406 during the last "N"" (e.g., 40) milliseconds, the flight and
timing data which was buffered in step 410 during the last "N" milliseconds, and an "N"
millisecond fraction of a video frame defined by the image/video and timing data buffered in
step 414 of FIG. 4. Subsequent to generating the packet header and packet payload, the data
recorder generates a combined packet (e.g., combined packet 300 of FIGS. 3A-3C), as shown by
step 514. The combined packet is generated by encapsulating the packet payload generated in
step 512 with the packet header generated in step 510. Thereafter, step 516 is performed where
the process ends or other processing is performed.
[0044]       In view of the forgoing, it should be apparent that the present invention provides a
data recording system in which different types of data are synchronized on a single packet with a
single time source and resolution of "N" (e.g., 40) milliseconds. Consequently, the present
                                               12

invention overcomes various drawbacks of conventional data recording systems. For example,
the present invention provides a way to synchronize data which does not require a manual or
automatic data synchronization process to be performed after a crash. As such, the present
invention provides a data synchronization process that is less time consuming, costly, complex
and computationally intensive as compared to conventional data synchronization processes (such
as those described above in the background section of this document).
