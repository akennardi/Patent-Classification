ABSTRACT
In some embodiments, a revision implant includes a body extending between a first planar
surface and a second planar surface and a head extending from the first planar surface of the
body. The head is configured to couple the revision implant to at least one additional component
of a multi-component prosthesis. At least one coupling mechanism is configured to couple the
body to a first bone.

                             REVISION TOTAL ANKLE IMPLANTS
BACKGROUND
        Ill      Total ankle replacement systems degrade over time and require replacement. In
revision ankle surgery, a total ankle implant is removed and replaced with a new total ankle
implant. When the primary implants are removed, a large bone void is left. The bone void is
larger than the size of the primary implants removed during the total ankle replacement.
        [2]      The size of a bone void cannot be determined prior to surgery using current
techniques. Current ankle revision systems further require additional cuts and/or modifications
of one or more ankle bones during a revision surgery. Primary components must be removed
and replaced with augments, which do not provide the same fixed engagement as primary
components.
SUMMARY
        [3]      In various embodiments, a revision implant includes a body extending between a
first planar surface and a second planar surface and a head extending from the first planar surface
of the body. The head is configured to couple the revision implant to at least one additional
component of a multi-component prosthesis. At least one coupling mechanism is configured to
couple the body to a first bone.
        [4]      In various embodiments, a surgical method is disclosed. The surgical method
includes creating an incision in a patient and exposing a multi-component prosthesis implanted
in a patient. At least one component of the multi-component prosthesis is disassembled and a
revision implant component is coupled to a first component of the multi-component prosthesis.
The revision implant component comprises a body extending between a first planar surface and a
second planar surface, a head extending from the first planar surface of the body and configured
to couple the revision implant to at least one additional component of a multi-component

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
       [29]      This description of the exemplary embodiments is intended to be read in
connection with the accompanying drawings, which are to be considered part of the entire
written description. The drawing figures are not necessarily to scale and certain features may be
shown exaggerated in scale or in somewhat schematic form in the interest of clarity and
conciseness. In the description, relative terms such as "horizontal," "vertical," "up," "down,"
 "top" and "bottom" as well as derivatives thereof (e.g., "horizontally," "downwardly,"
 "upwardly," etc.) should be construed to refer to the orientation as then described or as shown in
the drawing figure under discussion. These relative terms are for convenience of description and
normally are not intended to require a particular orientation. Terms including "inwardly" versus
 "outwardly," "longitudinal" versus "lateral" and the like are to be interpreted relative to one
another or relative to an axis of elongation, or an axis or center of rotation, as appropriate.
Terms concerning attachments, coupling and the like, such as "connected" and "interconnected,"
refer to a relationship wherein structures are secured or attached to one another either directly or
indirectly through intervening structures, as well as both movable or rigid attachments or
relationships, unless expressly described otherwise. When only a single machine is illustrated,
the term "machine" shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or
jointly execute a set (or multiple sets) of instructions to perform any one or more of the
methodologies discussed herein. The term "operatively connected" is such an attachment,
coupling or connection that allows the pertinent structures to operate as intended by virtue of that
relationship. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses, if used, are intended to cover the
                                                     4

structures described, suggested, or rendered obvious by the written description or drawings for
performing the recited function, including not only structural equivalents but also equivalent
structures.
      [30]       The disclosed systems and methods advantageously enable revisions of total ankle
implants by providing wedges and block designed to be coupled to a primary (or original) total
ankle prosthesis component to fill in any gaps and/or voids formed in the bone from osteolysis or
during a revision procedure. Although the disclosed systems and methods are described with
reference to the INBONE total ankle system available from Wright Medical Technology, Inc., of
Arlington, TN, the disclosed systems and methods can be adapted for other multi-component
prosthesis systems.
      [31]       FIGS. 1A and 1B illustrate one example of a revision implant component 100a in
accordance with some embodiments. Referring first to FIG. 1A, revision implant component
100a includes a body 102 having an oblong shape including a first side 104, which is curved, and
a second side 106, which is also curved and disposed on the opposite side of body 102 as first
side 104. A third side 108 is flat and defines a planar surface and is disposed between first and
second sides 104 and 106. A fourth side 110 is also flat and defines a planar surface that is
disposed opposite third side 108 and between first and second sides 104, 106. Although revision
implant component 100a is described as including a plurality of sides 104, 106, 108, 110 that
extend between upper side 114 and bottom side 116, revision implant component 100a includes a
single side in the form of a circle, oval, or other continuous shape in some embodiments as will
be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.
      [32]       A head or protection 112 extends from an upper side 114 and is configured to
engage a second revision implant component or a modular stem component of an ankle
replacement or other prosthesis system. For example, in some embodiments, head 112 is tapered
such that it is configured to form a Morse taper with a corresponding recess of another revision
implant component or a modular stem component of an ankle replacement or other implant
system. In some embodiments, projection 112 is cylindrical, i.e., not tapered, and includes
threads, a bayonet coupling, and/or other attachment or coupling means for engaging a
complementary feature of another revision implant component or a component of an ankle
                                                    5

replacement system. Other coupling means for coupling revision implant component to another
revision implant component or a component of a multi-component prosthesis such as, for
example, screws, bolts, or other fasteners can also be used.
       [33]     Revision implant component 100a also includes features for coupling and
uncoupling the revision implant component 100a from other revision implant components and/or
a component of an ankle replacement or other implant system. In some embodiments, the
geometry of the revision implant can be complementary to other implant components or to the
geometry of intramedullary channels or cavities. The bottom surface 116 of the implant
component 100a includes a contoured surface 120 defining a channel 122 that extends inwardly
between a first leg 124a and a second leg 124b. The groove 126 extends inwardly from the
approximate midpoint of the channel 122 and is sized and configured to receive a raised
alignment guide 130 of a tibial platform 132 as best seen in FIG. 4D. The tibial platform 132 is
sized and configured to receive an articulating surface (not shown) therein. Examples of tibial
platforms are described in U.S. Patent 8,715,362, issued on May 6, 2014 and entitled "Ankle
Replacement System," which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The articulating
surface is sized and configured to articulate against a talar articulation surface, such as, for
example, the upper surface of a talar dome implant (see, e.g., FIGS. 20A-20D).
       [34]     The revision implant component 100a has a predetermined thickness extending
from the upper surface 114 to the lower surface 116. The body 102 can have any suitable
predetermined thickness, such as, for example, a thickness ranging from 2 mm to 20 mm, such
as, for example, 4 mm, 8 mm, 12 mm, 16 mm, and/or any range between 2 mm and 20 mm. In
some embodiments, the body 102 has a first predetermined width near a bottom surface 116 and
a second predetermined width near a top surface 114. The first predetermined width can be
greater than, less than, and/or equal to the second predetermined width. In some embodiments,
the second predetermined width is less than the first predetermined width such that the thickness
of the body 102 tapers from a bottom surface 116 to a top surface 114. In some embodiments,
the predetermined widths are selected to match the width of a primary tibial tray removed during
a total ankle revision. For example, in some embodiments, the tibial tray can have a width of
12mm - 30mm
                                                  6

      [351      As will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, the size and shape of the
revision implant components can be varied. For example, FIGS. 2A-2C illustrate another
embodiment of a tibial tray revision implant 100b. The tibial tray revision implant 100b includes
a body 102 having a generally rectangular shape. The sides 104-110 are substantially flat and
each define a substantially planar surface. The interfaces between adjacent sides 104-110, 114,
116 can be rounded, although one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the interfaces
can be pointed and/or chamfered. The tibial tray revision implant 100b is similar to the tibial
tray revision implant 100a described in conjunction with FIGS. 1A-IB, and similar description is
not repeated herein.
      [361      The bottom surface 116 of the tibial tray revision implant 100b defines a
generally planar surface having a groove 126 formed therein. The groove 126 extends inwardly
from the approximate midpoint of each of the side walls 108, 110 and is sized and configured to
receive a raised alignment guide 130 of a tibial platform 132, as shown in FIG. 2A. A hole 134
extends from the groove 126 into the body 102. In some embodiments, the hole 134 is located at
an approximate mid-point of the body 102, although it will be appreciated that the hole 134 can
extend into the body 102 from any point within the groove 126. The holes 134 is sized and
configured to receive a fastener therein. The fastener couples the revision implant 100b to one or
more other revision implant components and/or primary components of a multi-component
prosthesis.
      [371      FIGS. 3A-3C illustrate another embodiment of a tibial tray revision implant 100c.
The tibial tray revision 100c includes a body 102 defined by walls 104, 106, 108, and 110. The
side walls 104, 106 are tapered from a bottom surface 116 to a top surface 114. In some
embodiments, the walls 108, 110 define planar surfaces extending perpendicular to the bottom
surface 116 and/or the top surface 114. The tibial tray revision 100c is similar to the tibial tray
revision 100a described in conjunction with FIGS. 1A-IB, and similar description is not repeated
herein. In some embodiments, the tibial tray revision 100c can have an increased thickness to
accommodate additional bone removal during a revision procedure, although it will be
appreciated that the tibial tray revision 100c can have an increased, decreased, and/or constant
thickness as compared to a tibial tray installed during a previous total ankle replacement and/or
revision procedure.
                                                  7

       [381      As illustrated in FIGS. 3A-3B, the tibial tray revision implant 100c includes a
plurality of longitudinal protrusions 136a, 136b that extend from an upper surface 114 of the
body 102. The longitudinal protrusions 136a, 136b can be located on either side of the head 112.
The longitudinal protrusions 136a, 136b extend along any portion of the upper surface 114. For
example, in the illustrated embodiment, the longitudinal protrusions 136a, 136b are centered
with respect to the side walls 108, 110 and extend at least partially from the side walls 108, 110
towards the head 112. FIG. 3C illustrates a top-down view of upper surface 114.
       [391      In some embodiments, the tibial tray revision implant 100c includes a bottom
surface 116 is configured to interact with a top surface of a tibial insert (not shown). The bottom
surface 116 can have a rounded and/or squared surface configured to match the geometry of the a
tibial insert. In some embodiments, the bottom surface 116 can include one or more projections,
extensions, grooves, and/or insets configured to interact with one or more features of a tibial
insert.
       [40]
       [41]      FIGS. 4A-4D illustrate another embodiment of a tibial tray revision implant 100d.
The tibial tray revision implant 100d includes a body 102 having side walls 104, 106, 108, 110.
The tibial tray revision implant 100d is similar to the tibial tray revision implant 100a described
above with respect to FIGS. 1A-1B, and similar description is not repeated herein. The tibial
tray revision implant 100d omits the head 112 and includes a planar upper surface 114. The
planar upper surface 114 is configured to couple to one or more components of a total ankle
prosthesis and/or one or more revision implants. In some embodiments, a fastener hole (not
shown) extends through the body 102 of the tibial tray revision implant 100d.
       [42]      FIG. 4C illustrates one embodiment of a tibial tray revision implant 1 00d having a
tibial platform 132 coupled thereto. The tibial platform 132 includes a body 152 extending
between an upper surface 154 and a lower surface 156. The tibial tray 150 includes side walls
158, 160, a front wall 162, and a back wall 164. The side walls 158, 160 and the back wall 164
define a slot 172 for receiving an articulation component (not shown) therein. In some
embodiments, the side walls 158, 160 define retaining legs 166a, 166b having a tapered inner
wall 174 configured to retain the articulation component therein.
                                                  8

       [431      The upper surface 154 of the tibial platform 132 includes a contoured surface
sized and configured to mate with the contoured lower surface 116 of the tibial revision implant
100d. In some embodiments, the tibial platform 132 includes a raised alignment guide 130. The
raised alignment guide 130 is sized and configured to fit within the groove 126 formed in the
bottom surface 116 of the tibial revision implant 100d. The raised alignment guide 130 and the
groove cooperate to position the tibial platform 132 in a predetermined position with respect to
the tibial revision implant 100d. In some embodiments, the raised alignment guide 130 extends
longitudinally from the front wall 162 towards a center point of the body 152. In other
embodiments, the raised alignment guide 130 has a length configured to match the length of the
groove 126.
       [44]       As shown in FIG. 4D, in some embodiments, a head 168 extends from an upper
surface 154 of the tibial platform 132. The head 168 is sized and configured to mate with the
head opening 134 defined by the tibial tray revision implant 100d. The head 168 can define a
fastener hole (not shown) that is concentric with a fastener hole 140 formed through the tibial
tray revision implant 100d. In some embodiments, the raised alignment guide 130 and the head
168 provide a fixed engagement position of the tibial platform 130 with respect to the tibial tray
revision implant 100d. In some embodiments, the head 168 has the same length and
circumference as the head 112 formed on the tibial tray revision implant 100a.
       [45]      FIG. 5 illustrates one embodiment of a tibial portion 200a of a total ankle
prosthesis having a tibial tray revision implant 100a coupled thereto. The tibial portion 200a
includes a stem 202 having one or more stem components 204, 206. The tibial revision implant
100a is coupled to the bottom stem component 206. For example, in some embodiments, the
head 112 is inserted into a hole formed in a bottom surface of the stem 202 (not shown). The
tibial revision implant 100a increases the spacing between the stem 202 and the tibial platform
132 to fill a bone void formed in the ankle joint.
       [461      FIGS. 6A-6B illustrate another embodiment of a tibial portion 200b of a total
ankle prosthesis having a tibial tray revision implant 100d coupled thereto. The tibial portion
200b is similar to the tibial portion described in conjunction with FIG. 5 and similar description
is not repeated herein. The tibial tray revision implant 100d defines a stem hole extending from
                                                   9

an upper surface 116 through the body 102 to the lower surface 114. The stem hole is sized and
configured to receive a portion of the stem 202 therein. The stem hole is further sized and
configured to receive a head 168 of a tibial platform 132 therein. The head 168 of the tibial
platform 132 is configured to mate with a bottom portion 206 of the stem 202. When the tibial
platform 132 is coupled to the stem 202, the revision implant 100d and the tibial platform 132
are maintained in a fixed position with respect to the stem 202.
      [471       FIG. 7 illustrates another embodiment of a tibial portion 200c of a total ankle
prosthesis having a tibial tray revision 100a coupled thereto. The tibial portion 200c is similar to
the tibial portion described in conjunction with FIG. 5, and similar description is not repeated
herein. The tibial platform 132 includes a fastener hole 180 extending from an upper surface 154
through the body 152 to a lower surface 156. The fastener hole 180 is sized and configured to
receive a fastener 182 therein. The fastener 182 extends through the fastener hole 180 and can
extend into one or more fastener holes 140 formed in the tibial tray revision 100a. In some
embodiments, the fastener 182 extends through the tibial tray revision 100a and mates with a
fastener hole formed in a bottom portion 206 of the stem 202.
      [481       FIGS. 8A-8B illustrate another embodiments of a tibial portion 200d of a total
ankle prosthesis having a tibial tray revision 100d coupled thereto. The tibial portion 200c is
similar to the tibial portion 200a described in conjunction with FIG. 5, and similar description is
not repeated herein. The tibial platform 132 includes two fastener holes 180a, 180b extending
from an upper surface 154 through the body 152 to the lower surface 156. The fastener holes
180a, 180b are sized and configured to receive fasteners 182 therethrough. The fasteners 182
extend through the fastener holes 180a, 180b and anchor the tibial platform 132 to the tibial tray
revision implant 100d. In some embodiments, the fasteners 182 extend through the tibial tray
revision implant 100d such that a first end of the fastener 182 extends at least partially above the
upper surface 114 of the tibial tray revision implant 100d.
      [49]       FIGS. 9A-9B illustrate one embodiment of a tibial tray revision implant 100e
having a body 102 defined by side walls 104, 106, 108, 110. The revision implant 100e is
similar to the revision implant 100a described in conjunction with FIGS. 1A-1B, and similar
description is not repeated herein. The bottom surface 116 of the revision implant 100e defines a
                                                  10

head opening 138 sized and configured to receive a head 168 of a tibial platform 132 therein.
The body 102 defines a perimeter having a width less than the width of an upper surface 154 of
the tibial platform 132. In some embodiments, at least one side wall 108 abuts an alignment
guide 130 formed on the upper surface 154 of the tibial platform 132. In some embodiments, the
top surface 114 of the tibial tray revision implant 100e is slanted from a first side wall 104 to a
second side wall 106.
       [50]      In some embodiments, a total ankle revision includes revision and/or replacement
of a talar prosthesis. FIGS. 10 illustrates one embodiment of talar revision plate 300a. The talar
revision plate 300a includes a body 302 having a predetermined thickness extending between a
upper surface 304 and a lower surface 306. The upper and lower surfaces 304, 306 generally
define planar surfaces. A side wall 308 extends about a perimeter of the body 302. In some
embodiments, the revision plate 300a includes a head 312 extending from the upper surface 304
of the body 302. The head 312 is sized and configured to couple a talar dome (or other talar
prosthesis) to the revision plate 300a. In some embodiments, the head 312 has a cylindrical
shape and extends a predetermined height above the upper surface 304. A removal feature 314
can extend through an upper portion of the head 312 to allow for removal of the revision plate
300a during the same and/or subsequent revision procedures. In some embodiments, the head

can be selectively coupled to the talar plate 300p by a surgeon during a revision procedure. The
talar augment 400c includes dome-shaped body 402 having a plurality of cutouts 440 formed
therein. The plurality of cutouts are sized and configured to receive one or more pegs 330
therethrough. In some embodiments, the talar augment 400c includes a stem hole 420 formed in
an upper surface 404, such as, for example, at the apex of the dome-shaped body 402.
      [66]      In some embodiments, a total ankle revision includes a talar dome primary
prosthesis and/or a revision talar dome. FIGS. 21A-21D illustrate one embodiment of a revision
talar dome 500 sized and configured to replace a primary talar dome during a revision procedure.
The talar dome 500 includes a body 502 extending between an upper surface 504 and a lower
surface 506. The upper surface 504 defines an articulating surface having a convex or saddle
shape. The articulating surface is sized and configured to articulate against a tibial platform 132
received in a tibial revision implant component. The lower surface 506 is a planar surface. In
some embodiments, a head opening 514 extends from the lower surface 506 at least partially into
the body 502. The head opening 541 is sized and configured to receive a head extending from
one or more ankle prosthesis components, such as a talar revision plate, therein. The head

      [671      As described above, the revision implant components/augments can have a
variety of shapes and geometries. In some embodiments, the revision implant
components/augments are formed from a plasma sprayed titanium, although other materials
                                                 16

including, but not limited to, BIOFOAM@, available from Wright Medical Technology, Inc., and
other metal, ceramic, plastic, and bone growth materials.
       [68]     The size and shape of the components of the total ankle revision system 2 can be
selected after pre-operative assessment using fluoroscopy to identify the position of a multi
component prosthesis that is implanted in bone, or the selection of the appropriate revision
implant component/augment 4-10 can be performed intraoperatively by a surgeon or other
healthcare provider after reviewing the implant site. In some embodiments, the revision implant
components/augments 4-10 are individually sterilized and packaged while in some embodiments
the implant components/augments 4-10 are provided in a kit. For example, when provided in a
kit, each individual implant component/augment 4-10 may be individually packaged and
included in a larger container or packaging. However, kits can also be formed without packing
multiple implant components/augments 4-10 in a single package.
       [69]     During a revision operation, a multi-component prosthesis 100 that was
previously implant in a patient may be partially or completely disassembled. For example, if the
multi-component implant 100 includes a tibial platform 102, a tibial tray 4, and a talar dome 6,
then the surgeon can decouple the tibial platform 102, the tibial tray 104, the talar dome 106
using a tool such a screw driver, a dowel, or a specialized instrument as will be understood by
one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, a tibial platform 102 can be separated from a tibial
tray 104 by disengaging the Morse taper or unscrewing the implant components. If, for example,
the multi-component prosthesis 100 is a talar prosthesis, then the talar dome 6 can be decoupled
from talar stem (not shown) by disengaging the Morse taper coupling. When completely
disassembled, the entire multi-component prosthesis is removed from the patient.
       [701     With the multi-component implant at least partially disassembled, one or more
revision implant components/augments 4-10 are assembled to the multi-component prosthesis in
situ using the applicable attachment mechanism. In some embodiments, the in situ attachment
includes inserting one or more revision implant components/augments 4-10 into a pre-existing
intramedullary cavity and attaching the revision implant components/augments 4-10 to the
implanted component(s) of the multi-component prosthesis. It is also possible to couple together
one or more revision implant components/augments 4-10 with one or more components of the
                                                  17

multi-component prosthesis ex situ and then couple the resulting assemblage to any components
of the multi-component prosthesis. For example, if the multi-component implant is completely
removed from the patient, the surgeon or another medical professional or care giver can implant
one or more components of a multi-component prosthesis with one or more revision implant
components/augments 4-10.
      [711       As described above, the components of the total ankle revision system 2 can have
different shapes from each other and/or from the shapes of the other components of the total
ankle revision system 2. The components of the total ankle revision system 2 are coupled
together to fill a void in a bone. Additionally, a single component/augment can include multiple
attachment means, such as, for example, a taper, threads, a bayonet coupling, to list but only a
few possibilities.
      [72]       Although the devices, kits, systems, and methods have been described in terms of
exemplary embodiments, they are not limited thereto. Rather, the appended claims should be
construed broadly, to include other variants and embodiments of the devices, kits, systems, and
methods, which may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and
range of equivalents of the devices, kits, systems, and methods.
