IMPROVEMENTS IN AND RELATING TO SCREENS
Cross-Reference to Related Application
[0001] The content of Australian Patent Application No. 2015208913 is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety.
Field
[0002] The present invention relates to downhole tools. The present invention relates to screens,
such as downhole screens, such as sand screens.
[0003] Screens are used in tubular systems to separate particulate from fluids. Such systems are
used in the downhole completion field to separate sand and other particulate from fluids, e.g.
production fluids or hydrocarbons, such as oil, water and gas.
Background
[0004] As outlined in W02004/099560 (BP EXPLORATION), in the course of completing an
oil and/or gas well, it is common practice to run a string of casing into the well-bore and then to
run the production tubing inside the casing. The casing is perforated across one or more
hydrocarbon bearing zones (hereinafter 'producing zones') to allow produced fluids to enter the
casing bore. After the well is completed and placed in production, formation sand from
unconsolidated formations may be swept into the flow path along with produced fluids. This
sand is relatively fine and causes erosion of tubing, downhole equipment and surface equipment.
In some completions, however, the well bore is uncased, and an open face is established across
the producing zone, in particular, in horizontal well completions. Similarly, after the well is
completed and placed in production, formation sand from unconsolidated formation may be
swept into the flow path along with produced fluids.
[0005] With either cased or uncased well-bores, one or more sand screens may be installed in
the flow path between the production tubing and the producing zone(s). A packer may be set
above and below the sand screen to seal off the annulus in the producing zone from non
producing zones of the formation. The annulus around the screen may be packed with a
relatively coarse sand or gravel which acts as a filter to reduce the amount of fine formation

                                                   2
sand reaching the screen. Nevertheless, the remaining sand contained in the produced fluids
may impinge on a screen with sufficient velocity so as to cause erosion of the screen. As the
velocity of the flow of the produced fluids is increased, the rate of erosion also increases.
Where the fluid flow rate from one portion of the formation is greater than the fluid flow rate
from another portion of the formation, the screen will erode more rapidly opposite the high flow
rate portion than it will opposite the lower flow rate portion.
[0006] W02004/099560 (BP EXPLORATION) discloses a sand screen comprising a perforated
base pipe and an erosion resistant microporous sleeve. The erosion resistant microporous
material of the sleeve is selected from the group consisting of microporous polymeric foams,
microporous metal foams, microporous carbide monoliths, and microporous nitride monoliths.
[0007] W02011/130122 (BAKER HUGHES) discloses a screen device including a foam body
having a passageway that extends longitudinally through the foam body, the foam body having
an open cell structure such that at least two surfaces of the foam body are in fluidic
communication with one another through the foam body.
[0008] In well completions having screened pipe, the screened pipe typically comprises base
pipe (or inner pipe) overlaid by a screen (or outer jacket). The base pipe can be solid or slotted.
The outer screen has hole or port dimensions selected to filter out particles above a desired size
during production. The screen can be attached to the base pipe by axial support rods welded to
an outer surface of the base pipe, which rods are then overlaid circumferentially by wire with a
triangular cross-section. The points of the triangular wire are welded to the axial support rods.
Between the rods, at least partly annular spaces are created between the circumferential wire
wrap screen and the base pipe.
[0009] There has been identified a need for the base pipe to be isolated from the through-bore
initially so that some other operations can be performed. Therefore, if the base pipe is solid, the
openings that provide through-bore communication need to be initially closed. If the base pipe
is perforated/slotted, the perforations need initially to be sealed. Prior to production, there may
be a wish to stimulate the well by injecting fluids into the hydrocarbon (HC) formation in a
reverse direction to production. Since injection involves pumping of high pressure/flow rate
fluids through the screen in a reverse direction, the screen must be able to withstand erosion in
both directions (covering injection followed by production). In addition there may be a wish to

                                                   3
distribute injected fluids in a uniform manner across the hydrocarbon formation (if possible) to
seek to ensure all portions of the formation are equally stimulated.
[0010] There may be a desire that the annulus between the screen and the base pipe of all
adjacent sand screen joints can be or is inter-connected.
[0011] It is an object of at least one general solution or aspect of the present invention to obviate
or at least mitigate one or more problems and/or disadvantages in the prior art.

Description of Embodiments
[0233] Referring to Figure 1, there is illustrated a screen or sand screen, generally designated
5a, operatively positioned in a subterranean well-bore 1Oa adjacent to a formation 15a which has
been lined with protective casing 20a. The casing 20a has been perforated 21 a to permit fluid
flow between formation 15a and well-bore 10a. Screen 5a is suspended from pipe or production
tubing 25a which extends to a well-head 30a and comprises a permeable sleeve 3 1a formed from
wire.
[0234] During production of fluids - represented by arrows 35a - from the formation 15a, the
fluids enter the screen 5a and are transported to the well-head through the tubing 25a. Any sand
in the fluid 35a should be filtered out by the screen 5a and not permitted to flow into the pipe
25a. The screen 5a is gradually eroded over time as the fluid 35a flows through the screen 5a.
Higher rates of flow of the fluid 35a through the screen 5a cause faster erosion of the screen 5a.
The screen 5a can also be used for injection of fluids into the formation - in a direction opposite
to the arrows 35a.
[0235] If the rate of flow of the fluid through a particular perforation 21 a is greater than the rate
of flow of the fluid 35a through the other perforations 21a - as is frequently the case in gas wells
- a portion 45a of the screen 5a opposite the high flow rate perforation 21a will erode faster than
another portion or portions of the screen 5a. When the portion 45a of the screen 5a has eroded
enough to permit sand and other debris to enter the tubing, the entire screen 5a must be replaced
at great cost to the well operator, even though most of the screen 5a is not yet eroded.
[0236] Referring next to Figure 2, there is illustrated an alternative screen or sand screen,
generally designated 5b. The screen 5b is shown within a well-bore 10b of an earth formation
15b. The screen 5b has a cylindrical sleeve or foam body 50b, which in one implementation is
an open cell foam body which surrounds a pipe or tubular 25b positioned within a through-bore
or void 55b that extends longitudinally through the foam body or sleeve 50b. The foam body or
sleeve 50b is an open cell structured foam which allows fluid to flow therethrough from an
outside of the screen 5b, defined by an outer surface, to the void 55b. The cell structured foam
provides filtering of fluid passing therethrough. Perforations or ports 40b in the pipe 25b allow
fluid passing through the screen 5b to flow to an inside of the through-bore 55b. Once the fluid
is on an inside of the through-bore 55b the fluid can flow longitudinally through the pipe 25b in

                                                   22
either direction. Fluid initially on the inside of the through-bore 55b can also flow out through
the perforations 40b, through the open cell structured foam and to the outside.
[0237] Referring now to Figures 3(a) - (c) there is shown a screen, such as a downhole/sand
screen, 5c according to the prior art. The screen 5c comprises a pipe (tubular) 25c and a sleeve
(permeable sleeve) 31 c and a plurality of circumferentially disposed supports 32c provided
between the pipe 25c and the sleeve 31c, wherein each support 32c has a cross-section
comprising a triangular shape.
[0238] Further the sleeve 3 1c comprises wire 33c which has a cross-section comprising a further
triangular shape. The wire 33c is circumferentially disposed or wound.
[0239] There will now be illustrated, by way of non-limiting example only, a number of
embodiments of screens or screen assemblies according to the present invention which may find
utility in well-bore completions as shown in Figure 1 and/or Figure 2.
[0240] Referring now to Figure 4, there is shown a screen or screen assembly 105, such as a
downhole/sand screen or screen assembly, comprising a pipe 125 and a sleeve 131 and at least
one support 132 provided between the pipe 125 and the sleeve 131, wherein the at least one
support 132 has a cross-section comprising first and second points or vertices or surface
discontinuities or corners 160. Such support shape can provide enhanced erosion resistance.
[0241] The pipe 125 can be referred to as a base pipe or production pipe or tubing. The pipe is
perforated and comprises a plurality of ports 162. The first and second points, vertices, surface
discontinuities or corners 160 (hereinafter 'points')comprise a pair of points 160. The first and
second points 160 face in substantially opposing directions along a radius or radial direction.
[0242] The at least one support 132 comprises a plurality of supports 132, i.e. axial supports
and/or support rods. The supports 132 are disposed in an annular space between the pipe 125
and the sleeve 131.
[0243] In one implementation (shown in Figure 4) the/each support 132 has a cross-section
comprising a polygon having at least four sides, parallelogram, rectilinear, square or diamond
shape.

                                                 23
[0244] In another implementation (shown in Figure 5) the/each support 132' has a cross-section
comprising a polygon having six sides, i.e. a polygon having opposing triangular end portions
and a rectilinear or square mid-portion.
[0245] A first point 160; 160' is welded to the pipe 125; 125', i.e. an outer surface of the pipe.
A second point 160; 160'; 132; 132' is welded to the sleeve 131; 131' i.e. an inner surface of the
sleeve 131.
[0246] The support(s) is/are typically made from steel.
[0247] Referring next to Figure 6, there is shown a screen or screen assembly 205, such as a
downhole/sand screen or screen assembly, comprising wire 233 having a cross-section
comprising first and second points or vertices or surface discontinuities or corners 261. Such
wire shape can provide enhanced erosion resistance.
[0248] The first and second points, vertices, surface discontinuities or corners 261 (hereinafter
'points') comprise a pair of points 261. The first and second points 261 face in substantially
opposing directions, e.g. along a radius or radial direction.
[0249] The screen 205 comprises a pipe 225 and a sleeve 231 (the sleeve 231 comprising the
wire233/screen), and at least one support 232. The pipe 225 can be referred to as a base pipe or
production tubing. The at least one support 232 comprises a plurality 232 of supports, e.g. axial
supports and/or support rods. The supports 232 are disposed in an annular space 234 between
the pipe 225 and the sleeve 231.
[0250] In one implementation (shown in Figure 6) the/each wire 233 has a cross-section
comprising a polygon having at least four sides or diamond shape.
[0251] In another implementation (shown in Figure 7) the/each wire 233' has a cross-section
comprising a polygon having six sides, e.g. a polygon having opposing triangular end portions
and a rectilinear or square mid-portion.
[0252] A first point 261; 261' is welded to a support 232; 232', e.g. an outer surface of the
support 232; 232'. A second point 261; 261' faces radially out, e.g. towards a formation or
inner facing surface of a well-bore.

                                                 24
[0253] The wire 233; 233' is typically made from steel.
[0254] Referring next to Figures 8(a) - (b) there is shown a screen or screen assembly 305, such
as a downhole/sand screen or screen assembly, wherein the screen 305 comprises wire 333
having a cross-section comprising a rectilinear or square shape. Such wire shape can provide
enhanced erosion resistance.
[0255] The rectilinear shape comprises a rectangle or in this preferred implementation
comprises a square. The wire 333 is disposed such that a line of symmetry of the rectilinear
shape is provided along a radial direction of the screen 305 or pipe 325.
[0256] The screen 305 comprises a pipe 325 and a sleeve 331 (the sleeve comprising the
wire/screen), and at least one support 332. A side of the wire 333 is welded to the support(s)
332.
[0257] Referring next to Figure 8(c) there is shown a screen or screen assembly 305', such as a
downhole/sand screen or screen assembly. The screen 305' is similar to the screen 305, like
ports being identified by like numerals but suffixed "'.
[0258] Referring next to Figure 8(d) there is shown a screen or screen assembly 305", such as a
downhole/sand screen or assembly. The screen 305" is similar to the screen 305; 305' like ports
being identified by like numerals, but suffixed "". In the screen 305" of Figure 8(d) the pipe
325 comprise a tubular having a solid wall, i.e. which is not perforated.
[0259] Where wrap wires 333; 333'; 333" of a square cross-section are used to construct the
filter media the smooth passage created under such will reduce turbulence and tend flow to
continue longitudinally. This can promote a more even distribution of injection fluid through
the wire wrap 333; 333'; 333".
[0260] The construction of the filter media can be used in situations where the base pipe is
perforated (shown in Figures 8(a) - (b) and Figure 8 (c)) or where the base pipe is imperforated
(shown in Figure 8 (d)) and flow enters the annulus between the base pipe and the wrap wires at
a point lower down the sand screen joint.

                                                  25
[0261] It will be appreciated any combination of shape of wire (wire wrap) and/or support is
possible, e.g. wire and/or supports selected from triangular, diamond shape, hexagonal, elongate
hexagonal, square or rectangular cross-sectional shape (though not both triangular). It will be
appreciated that any such combination of wire and support shape may provide enhanced erosion
resistance in at least one of injection and production.
[0262] Regarding the wire of the screen or screen assembly of Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8(a)
(b), Figure 8(c) or Figure 8(d), or indeed Figures 3(a) - (c), the wire comprises coated and/or
hardened wire 233; 233'; 333; 333'; 333"; 333c. The wire can beneficially be made from steel.
[0263] The screen comprises a pipe and a sleeve, the sleeve comprising the wire, and optionally
at least one support.
[0264] In one implementation the coating is tungsten carbide, e.g. hardide tungsten carbide.
The coating is applied or deposited by chemical vapour deposition (CVD), which can be applied
to steel. The wire can be heat treated so as to harden.
[0265] The wire can be provided in coated and/or hardened lengths and made-up or assembled
in longer lengths so as to provide the sleeve.
[0266] Referring next to Figures 9(a) - (e) and Figure 14(a) - (b) there is shown a screen or
screen assembly 405; 405', such as a downhole or sand screen or screen assembly, comprising a
pipe 425; 425' and a plurality of ceramic discs 470; 470' around the pipe 425; 425'. High
hardness of the ceramic provides enhanced erosion resistance.
[0267] The ceramic discs 470; 470' are stacked on each other. Gaps between the discs 470;
470' determine a size of particulate to be filtered, and can be modified to suit a well and a
specification of an operator.
[0268] The pipe 425 can be referred to as a base pipe or production tubing. In one
implementation (see Figures 9(a) - (e)) the pipe 425 is perforated and/or comprises a plurality of
ports 440. The pipe 425 is slotted. In another implementation (see Figures 14(a) and (b)) the
pipe 425' is non-permeable or solid.

                                                  26
[0269] The pipe 425 comprises a plurality of ports 440, e.g. slots, e.g. circumferentially and
axially spaced thereupon.
[0270] One or more of the discs 470; 470' are arranged so as to provide circumferential/annular
spaces 471; 471' between the pipe 425; 425' and the respective disc 470; 470'.
[0271] Between adjacent circumferential/annular spaces 471; 471' the disc(s) 470; 470' are
arranged such that there is no gap between the pipe 425; 425' and the disc 470; 470'. Such
arrangement is provided by portions of the disc 470; 470' having reduced internal diameter, i.e.
such that the pipe 425; 425' and the disc(s) 470; 470' radially abut or contact one another at said
portions.
[0272] The space(s) 471; 471' extend longitudinally between adjacent discs 470; 470'. The
space(s) 420; 420' are aligned, i.e. rotationally aligned, with at least one port 440 in the pipe
425; 425'.
[0273] A valve member 473 is provided between a port 440 and a respective space 471.
The/each valve member 473 comprises a slidable member, i.e. longitudinally slidable member.
Each valve member 473 comprises at least one further port 474 and/or at least one reed valve

of the pipe 425.
[0274] The screen or screen assembly also comprises an inner sleeve 476 (see Figure 9(a)). The
inner sleeve 476 is slidable relative to the pipe 425. An outer surface of the inner sleeve 476
abuts or contacts an inner surface of the pipe 425.
[0275] The inner sleeve 476 comprises at least one yet further port 477 and/or further reed valve
478, which is/are (longitudinally) selectively alignable with or out of alignment with a port 440
of the pipe 425.
[0276] Referring to Figures 14(a) - (b), there is shown a screen or screen assembly 405, such as
a downhole screen or screen assembly, comprising a pipe 425' and/or sleeve comprising discs
470', wherein the pipe comprises a solid or non-perforated pipe 425'. Such arrangement can
provide enhanced erosion resistance. The solid or non-perforated pipe 425' can comprise or be

                                                 27
provided with an opening(s) or port(s) at or adjacent an end(s) thereof, e.g. to deliver injection
fluid to a formation.
[0277] Referring to Figures 10(a) - (c) there is shown a screen or screen assembly 505, such as
a downhole/sand screen or screen assembly, comprising a pipe 525 and a sleeve 531, wherein
the pipe 525 comprises openings or slots (e.g. longitudinally or axially opening(s) or slot(s)) 540
and the sleeve 531 comprises a foam or microporous material the sleeve 531 being bonded with
or to an exterior surface of the pipe. Such arrangement can provide enhanced erosion resistance.
Such arrangement can provide relatively even distribution of injection fluids.
[0278] The pipe can be referred to as a base pipe or production tubing. The openings or slots
can comprise daisy passages. The opening or slots, in use, fluidically communicate with the
sleeve.
[0279] Referring to Figures 15(a) - (d), there is shown a screen or screen assembly 505', such
as a downhole/sand screen or screen assembly, comprising a pipe 525' and a microporous sleeve
531', wherein the pipe 525' comprises a plurality of slotted ports 540' or longitudinally
extending ports 540'. Such arrangement can provide enhanced erosion resistance, and operates
in a similar manner to the screen of Figures 10 (a) - (c).
[0280] The following optional features apply to any disclosed embodiments.
[0281] The pipe is typically referred to as base pipe or production tubing.
[0282] Where provided the microporous sleeve 531; 531 'can be an erosion resistant
microporous sleeve. The microporous sleeve 531; 531' comprises a material selected from a
metal foam or a ceramic foam. The microporous sleeve 531; 531' comprises a material selected
from the group consisting of microporous polymeric foams, microporous metal foams,
microporous carbide monoliths, in particular, silicon carbide, tungsten carbide, or titanium
carbide monoliths or microporous nitride monoliths, such as boron nitride. The microporous
sleeve 531; 531' intimately contacts and/or is bonded to an outer surface of the pipe 525; 525'.
[0283] Referring now to Figures 9(a) - (e), Figures 10(a) - (c), Figure 11(a) and Figures 15 (a)
- (c) there is shown screens or screen assemblies 405; 505; 605; 505', such as a downhole/sand
screen or screen assembly, comprising a pipe 425; 525; 625; 525' having at least one port 440;

                                                28
540; 640; 540' or perforation or hole, the/each port 440; 540; 640; 540' or perforation or hole
having an associated valve 473; 573; 673; 573'.
[0284] The pipe 425; 525; 625; 525' can be referred to as a base pipe or production tubing.
The/each valve 473; 573; 673; 673' can be a check valve.
[0285] The pipe 425; 525; 625; 625' comprises a plurality of ports 440; 540; 640; 640' or
perforations, each port 440; 540; 640; 640' or perforation having an associated valve 473; 573;
673; 673'.
[0286] The/each valve 473; 573; 673; 673' is, in use, initially provided to isolate the inner
diameter of the pipe 425; 525; 625; 525' from the outer diameter of the pipe 425; 525; 625;
525'. Upon opening the valve(s) 473; 573; 673; 573' the provision of multiple
ports/perforations/holes in the pipe 425; 525; 625; 525' provides improved distribution of
injection fluid. The/each valve 473; 573; 673; 573' comprises a valve member.
[0287] The/each valve member 573; 673; 573' is deployable by a sliding sleeve 580; 680; 580'
and/or by pressure of fluid flow, in use.
[0288] The sliding sleeve 580; 680; 580' can slide relative to an inner surface of the pipe 525;
625; 525'. The sliding sleeve 580; 680; 580' comprises a port(s) 581; 681; 581' which is
controllably aligned with ports 540; 640; 540' of the pipe 525; 625; 525'.
[0289] The valve member(s) 573; 673; 573' may be biased into a closed position, e.g. by
biasing means 582; 682; 582'.
[0290] In one implementation (see Figures 10(a) - (c)) the valve member(s) 573 comprises a
spherical member(s) or balls, e.g. biased spherical member(s). The/each spherical member or
ball is provided, i.e. movably provided, within a space provided by a port in the pipe and a
recessed portion in a sleeve.
[0291] Referring to Figure 10(d), when run-in hole the balls are press-fitted within a hole(s) in
the base pipe, as shown. The balls are supported by a sliding sleeve preventing differential
pressure from a outside passing through the filter media and forcing them through the base pipe.

                                                  29
Pressure is isolated between the outside and the inside of the base pipe via seals positioned on
the outer diameter (OD) of a (long) sliding sleeve.
[0292] Referring to Figure 10(b), when ready to open the sand screen up to flow, a short shift of
the base pipe will cause the recessed area in the sliding sleeve to push the balls out of their
respective holes in the base pipe; the new surface against which the balls rest prevents
differential pressure from the outside passing through the filter media and pushing the balls back
into the press fitted condition. Flow ports in the (long) sliding sleeve are now exposed below
the balls and a seal in the port within the base pipe provides a pressure check preventing
differential pressure from production flow passing into the sand screen. A (weak) spring
excerpts (gentle) pressure on the ball allowing it to seal at low differential pressures.
[0293] Referring to Figure 10(c), when subjected to injection flow the balls lift off of their
respective seats and compress the (weak) spring allowing flow to pass into the filter media.
[0294] Referring to Figure 11(a) in the screen 605, the perforated base pipe 625 can be sealed
off by a number of sliding sleeves 680. These can all be locked in place (opened and closed) by
means of latch fingers. Each sleeve 680 has a shift profile with a kick-down shoulder on the
rear of the sleeve 680 above it, meaning that as the sift tool can be pulled through, the shift tool
pulls open the sleeve and auto-out from the above kick-down shoulder whereupon it latches into
the next profile and opens that, and so on.
[0295] Referring to Figure 11(b) there is shown a screen or screen assembly 605', similar to the
screen 605 of Figure 11(a), like ports being identified by the numerals but suffixed "'.
[0296] In the screen 605', the topmost sleeve 680' has a shifting pole. The rest of the sleeves
680' are closely linked so that they all open at the same time, but are segmented to account for
concentricity, friction, bends etc.
[0297] In another implementation the valve member(s) comprise a flap, i.e. thin metallic or steel
flap, or reed valve.
[0298] Referring next to Figures 12(a) - (f) there is shown a screen or screen assembly 705,
such as a downhole/sand screen or screen assembly, comprising a pipe 725 having at least one
port or perforation or hole 740, and a sleeve 785 provided within the pipe 725, the sleeve 785

                                                   30
having at least one respective port or perforation or hole 786 which in a closed position is not
aligned or is misaligned with the at least one port or perforation or hole 740 in or on the pipe
725 but which in an open position is alignable or aligned with the at least one port or perforation
or hole 740 in or on the pipe 725. The pipe 725 can be referred to as a base pipe or production
tubing.
[0299] The sleeve 785 (internal sleeve) comprises a shift sleeve. The sleeve 785 is slidable
relative to the pipe 725 so as to move from a closed to open position and optionally vice versa.
[0300] The pipe 725 comprises a plurality of ports or perforations or holes 740. The/each
sleeve 785 (internal sleeve) comprises a plurality of respective ports or perforations or holes
786. The presence of multiple ports/perforations/holes allows for improved distribution of
injection fluid. The screen 705 comprises an (outer) screen sleeve 731, e.g. comprising wire.
[0301] Referring again to Figures 12(a) - (f) there is shown a screen or screen assembly 705,
such as a downhole/sand screen or screen assembly, comprising a pipe 725, and a plurality of
inner sliding sleeves 785a; 785b provided within the pipe 725.
[0302] The pipe 725 can be referred to as a base pipe or production tubing.
[0303] The sleeves 785a, 785b are provided within the pipe 725. The sleeves 785a, 785b each
comprise a sliding/shift sleeve. There are provided first and second sleeves 785a; 785b, one
within the other.
[0304] Movement, i.e. sequential movement of the sleeves, causes alignment or misalignment,
of ports in the pipe 725 and the sleeve(s) 785a; 785b, e.g. opening or closing, of the screen.
Sliding movement of a first sleeve 785a causes sliding movement of a second sleeve 785b, i.e.
to open the screen 705. Sliding movement of a second sleeve 785b causes sliding movement of
a first sleeve 785a, i.e. to close the screen 705.
[0305] Referring yet again to Figures 12(a) - (f) there is shown a screen or screen assembly 705,
such as a downhole/sand screen or screen assembly, comprising a pipe 725 comprising at least
one port/perforation/hole 740, the or each port 740 having a respective seal 787.

                                                 31
[0306] The pipe 725 can be referred to as a base pipe or production tubing. The pipe 725
comprises a plurality of ports 740.
[0307] In a closed disposition the respective plug 787 is received or be provided within or
adjacent to the respective port 740. In an open disposition the respective plug 787 is provided
distal the respective port 740. The plug(s) 787 are carried by a sleeve 785a, i.e. on an outer
surface of a shifting/sliding sleeve provided within the pipe 725.
[0308] Referring to Figures 17(a) - (c) there is shown a modification to the screen 708 of
Figures 12(a) - (f). In the modified screen 708' shown in Figures 17(a) - (c) like parts are
identified by like numerals but suffixed "'.
[0309] In the screen 708' the seal 787' has plastic back-ups 788'.
[0310] Referring to Figure 17(a), with the seal 787' in place, the seal 787' is compressed against
the hole 740' in the base pipe 725'. A pressure differential from either direction will energise
the seal 787' and act to ensure pressure integrity. Referring to Figure 17(b), sliding the inner
sleeve 785b' de-supports the finger sleeve 785a' and relaxes compression in the seal 787'.
Referring to Figure 17(c), the finger sleeve 785' can now be slid to expose the hole 740'.
[0311] According to the present invention there is also provided a screen assembly, such as a
downhole/sand screen assembly, comprising a first screen 105; 205; 305; 305'; 305"; 405; 505;
605; 705; 405'; 505' 705' according to any preceding embodiment of the present invention and
a second screen 5c.
[0312] The first screen 705 and second screen 5c are longitudinally disposed relative to one
another. The first screen can be selected to be provided in high(er) flow areas, i.e. production
and/or particularly injection fluid flow areas. The second screen 5c can be selected to be
provided in low(er) flow areas, i.e. production and/or injection fluid flow areas. The second
screen can comprise wire having a cross-section comprising a triangular shape (see Figures 3(a)
- (c)).
[0313] Referring to Figure 18 there is shown a screen assembly 1000, such as a downhole/sand
screen assembly, comprising a first screen 1005a and a second screen 1005b. The pipe 1025 is
non-perforated. The first screen 1005a has a higher erosion resistance than the screen 1005b.

                                                   32
The first screen 1005a is a screen according to an embodiment of the present invention, e.g.
comprising ceramic discs. The second screen 1005b can be a screen according to the prior art.
[0314] Figures 18(a) and 18 (b) show injection and production fluid flow respectively. The pipe
1025 comprises a port 1040 longitudinally distal the screens 1005a, 1005b.
[0315] For sand screen configurations where production or injection flow enters or exits the
base pipe 1025 from a single point at one or either end of the sand screen 1025, the flow will
tend to take the path of least resistance and the majority of the flow will enter or exit a section of
sleeve 1031 a or filter media closest to that point. By incorporating a highly erosion resistant
portion of the screen 1005a closest to the flow port/s 1040, the erosion effect of the high
volume, high velocity flow in this area can be mitigated. The screen 1005a can comprise
ceramic discs. The remainder of the screen 1005b area will be less susceptible to erosion due to
the reduced flow rates and velocities, therefore, can be made up of a more conventional filter
media type such as metal mesh or wire wrap, e.g. of trianguler cross-section.
[0316] Referring now to Figures 16(a) - (i) there is shown a screen or screen assembly 305',
such as a downhole/sand screen or screen assembly, comprising a pipe 325' and a sleeve 331',
wherein the pipe 305' comprises a port(s) 362', and where the sleeve 331' comprises a solid or
wall portion(s) 390' at or near the port(s) 362'.
[0317] The solid or wall portions 390' are provided radially outwardly of the ports 362'.
[0318] The pipe 325' can be referred to as a base pipe or production tubing.
[0319] The port(s) 362' are provided on the pipe 325' and/or at each end of the pipe, in the latter
case the pipe optionally having a solid wall. The solid or wall portion(s) 390' are provided
radially adjacent the port(s), i.e. radially outward of the port(s).
[0320] This arrangement can provide that injection flow, i.e. high rate injection flow may meet
or hit a solid or wall portion, change direction and flow axially along an annulus between the
pipe 325' and the sleeve 331'. In this way an area of highest erosion is deflected to an area of
pipe 305' having a solid outer wall.

                                                 33
[0321] Referring next to Figures 13(a) and (b) and Figures 13(c) and (d), there is shown a screen
assembly 890a; 890b, such as a downhole/sand screen assembly, comprising first and second
screens 805a; 805b longitudinally coupled together, wherein there is provided a fluid flow path
891a; 891b between the first and second screens 805a; 805b.
[0322] The first screen 805a; 805b comprises a first pipe 825a; 825b and a first sleeve 831a;
83 lb. The second screen 805a; 805b comprises a second pipe 825a; 825b and a second sleeve
831a; 831b. The first and second pipes 825a; 825b are coupled by a coupling, i.e. a threaded
coupling 892a; 892b.
[0323] The first and second sleeves are coupled, i.e. by first and second support rings 893a;
894a; 893b; 894b and a centraliser or further sleeve or screen 895a; 895b.
[0324] The fluid flow path is annular.
[0325] Referring to Figures 13(a) and (b), there is shown a screen assembly 890a, such as a
downhole/sand screen assembly, comprising first and second screens 805a longitudinally
disposed relative to one another, wherein a centraliser 895a is provided between adjacent ends
of the first and second screens 805a.
[0326] A first support ring 893a is provided between an end of a sleeve 831a of the first screen
and a first end of the centraliser 895a. A second support ring 894a is provided between an end
of a sleeve 831a of the second screen and a second end of the centraliser 895a.
[0327] Referring to Figures 13(c) and (d), there is shown a screen assembly 890b, such as a
downhole/sand screen assembly, comprising first and second screens longitudinally disposed
relative to one another, wherein a further screen 895b or screen portion is provided between
adjacent ends of the first and second screens 805b.
[0328] A first support ring 893b is provided between an end of a sleeve 851b of the first screen
and a first end of the further screen 895b. A second support ring 894b is provided between an
end of a sleeve 831b of the second screen and a second end of the further screen 895b.

                                                 34
[0329] Referring to Figures 19(a) - (d), there is shown a screen or screen assembly 405", such
as a downhole or sand screen or screen assembly, comprising a pipe 425" and a plurality of
ceramic discs 470" around the pipe 425".
[0330] The ceramic discs 470" are stacked on each other. Gaps between discs 470" determine a
size of particulate to be filtered, and can be modified to suit a well and specification of an
operator.
[0331] At least one spacer 499" is provided between at least two adjacent discs 470", wherein
the/each at least spacer 499" is aligned with a respective hole 440" or slot or perforation in the
pipe 425".
[0332] Such provides enhanced erosion resistance.
[0333] The pipe 425" can be referred to as a base pipe or production tubing.
[0334] The/each spacer 499" is shaped to diffuse fluid flow exiting a hole 440" or slot of
perforation in the pipe 425". The spacer 499" comprises first and second surfaces 499"a, 499"b.
The first and second surfaces 499"a, 499"b are concave and face in opposing directions. Each
of the first and second surface 499"a, 499"b is radially diverging.
[0335] The discs 470" are provided around the pipe 425". Beneficially each spacer 499" is
integrally formed with a disc 470". Beneficially each disc 470" and/or each spacer 499" is made
from a ceramic material.
[0336] As shown in Figure 19(c), in this implementation, a plurality of longitudinally adjacent
discs 470" provide a plurality of circumferentially adjacent spacers 499". Such are rotationally
aligned with a hole/slot/perforation 440" in the pipe 425".
[0337] The discs 470" provide a filter media. Adjacent discs 470" are spaced from one another,
e.g. by the spacer(s) 499". The spacer(s) 499" are provided on a surface or face of the/each disc
470". Spacer(s) 499" are provided around the surface or face of the/each disc 470". As can be
seen from Figure 19(a) an outer sleeve is provided around the discs 470". The outer sleeve
which can be metallic protects the discs 470" during run-in.

                                                  35
[0338] Referring to Figure 20 there is shown a screen or screen assembly, such as a downhole
screen or screen assembly 2005.
[0339] 'X' shows the distance between the inner diameter (ID) of the borehole and the outer
diameter (OD) of a sand screen (dashed line). Within the (outer) sand screen (dashed line) is a
pipe or base pipe A. In or on the base pipe A is ajoint B. The joint B is a threaded connection
between two sections of base pipe ('C' indicates threads). The joint B has an additional function
- it protrudes into throughbore D and presents an incline E to act as a kick down shoulder.
Sleeve F provides ports G. The ports G can be aligned with ports H in the base pipe when the
sleeve F is moved. The sleeve F has a recess I on the inner surface (on the left hand side) to
accept keys that lock the sleeve F to a shifting tool (not shown).
[0340] In operation, keys on a shifting tool are biased outwardly, and as the shifting tool is
pulled up the throughbore D, the keys engage with the profile on the inner surface of the sleeve
F. Once the shifting tool keys are locked into the sleeve F, the shifting tool is pulled to align the
ports G in the sleeve F and the base pipe ports H. Once the sleeve F has reached its full extent
of travel, the joint B provides a shoulder stop for the shifting sleeve F and the keys on the
shifting tool B. This releases the keys and disengages the shifting tool from the sleeve F. The
process can be repeated for the next sleeve etc.
[0341] This arrangement provides for "buttom-up opening" of shifting sleeves.
[0342] Referring now to Figure 21, there is shown a downhole assembly or screen or screen
assembly 3005. Pipe A provides lateral ports H. A pin J is in the first of these ports H. The pin
J can run in a groove to ensure axial alignment of the sleeve F and restrict rotation. Once the
sleeve F has reached the full extent of travel, the pin J can drop into a groove to lock the sleeve
F in place. The pin J acts as an anti-rotation key.

welded to the axial support rod and opposing 'pointy' end facing the formation). This wire
shape is in intended to give enhanced erosion resistance. (See Figure 6).

                                                  37
        (iii)      Axial screen support rods having a cross-section of square/rectangular core
with triangular ends (i.e. one 'pointy' end welded to the base pipe and opposing 'pointy' end
welded to outer circumferential screen with square/rectangular middle section therebetween).
This wire shape is in intended to give enhanced erosion resistance. (See Figure 5).
        (iv)      Circumferential wire wrap using wire having a cross-section of
square/rectangular core with triangular ends (i.e. one 'pointy' end welded to the axial support
rod and the opposing 'pointy' end facing the formation with square/rectangular middle section
therebetween). This wire shape is in intended to give enhanced erosion resistance. (See Figure
7).
        (v)       Wire wrap screen or axial support rods having square cross-section. In this
case, the lack of 'pointy' end may result in less turbulence and therefore lower erosion rates.
This wire shape is in intended to give enhanced erosion resistance. (See Figures 8(a) and (b)).
        (vi)       Any combination of screen construction using axial supports and
circumferential screen from (i) - (v).
        (vii)     Coated wire/hardened wire. Can be used with any wire screen arrangement.
One example of the hardening process is hardide tungsten carbide chemical vapour deposition
(CVD). CVD can be applied to steel. The wire would need to be coated in shorter lengths then
made up/assembled into longer continuous lengths of screened pipe. (See Figures 3(a) and (b)
or Figure 6, Figure 7 or Figures 8(a) and (b)).
        (viii)    Stacks of ceramic disks overlaid on the base pipe (either slotted or solid). This
provides screen with enhanced erosion resistance. (See Figures 9(a) - (e) and Figures 14(a) and
(b)).
        (ix)      Microporous sand screen made from foamed metal or ceramic over slotted or
solid base pipe (again the solid base pipe would need opening(s) at the end to deliver injection
fluid to the annulus). Pore size can be adjusted to suit the requirements of the client. This
provides screen with enhanced erosion resistance. (See Figures 10(a) - (e)).
        (x)        Foamed screen made from metal or ceramic that is bonded with the exterior of
the base pipe, but with axial opening or slots (daisy passages) running along the exterior of the

                                                  38
base pipe to deliver fluid to the foamed screen. This provides screen with enhanced erosion
resistance on solid base pipe, but allowing for even distribution of injection fluids. (See Figures
10(a) - (c)).
        (xi)      Perforated base pipe, each perforation having an associated check valve. The
check valve is initially provided to isolate the ID and the OD of the base pipe, but the presence
of multiple holes in the base pipe allows more even distribution of the injection fluid. This can
be used with any of the enhanced erosion screen concepts or conventional screen. (See Figures
10(a) - (c) or Figures 11(a) - (i)).
        (xii)      Perforated base pipe with internal shift sleeve. Shift sleeves can have holes that
align with the closest portion of pipe when open, but which are misaligned over the pipe in the
closed position. The presence of multiple holes in the base pipe allows more even distribution of
the injection fluid. This can be used with any of the enhanced erosion screen concepts or
conventional screen. (See Figures 12(a) - (f)).
        (xiii)    Perforated base pipe with multiple shift sleeves, each sleeve ranging between
around 1 to 30 foot. The screens can be linked by flexible sections and glide rings provided to
reduce friction. The shifting sleeves can make use of o-rings/bonded seals/reed valves/check
valves. Screens are initially closed, then opened before injection operations commence to spread
the flow. (See Figures 12(a) - (f)).
        (xiv)     Perforations in the base pipe sealed by thin steel flaps (reed valves). The
presence of multiple holes in the base pipe allows more even distribution of the injection fluid.
This can be used with any of the enhanced erosion screen concepts or conventional screen. (See
Figures 9(a) - (e) and Figures 12(a) - (f)).
        (xv)     Perforations sealed by 'knock-out' plugs. The presence of multiple holes in the
base pipe allows more even distribution of the injection fluid. This can be used with any of the
enhanced erosion screen concepts or conventional screen. (See Figures 12(a) - (f)).
        (xvi)     Solid base pipe with split screen, i.e. a length of high erosion resistant screen in
high flow areas (i.e. a certain distance range from the openings) - any of concepts (i) to (ix),
followed by a longer length of normal triangular section wire wrap over the remaining area that
experiences lower flow rates. (See Figures 18(a) - (b)).

                                                   39
        (xvii)    Screen (any known type or (i) to (vii) that has solid areas near injection flow
openings, (such as at ends of solid base pipe and over holes in perforated base pipe). This allows
the high rate injection flow to hit a solid section, change direction and flow axially along the
annulus between base pipe and screen so that the potential area of highest erosion is at a portion
of solid pipe rather than screen. The solid part can be a ring wrapped over the top of the screen
or joined to adjacent sections of screen. (See Figures 16(a) - (d)).
        (xviii)   Coupling between adjacent screen joints provides a flow path and is also a
centraliser (dual function). (See Figures 13(a) and (b)).
        (xix)     Coupling between adjacent screen joints provides a flow path and is also screen.
(See Figures 13(c) and (d)).
