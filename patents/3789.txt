ORTHODONTIC BRACKET HAVING A BIASED SLIDE MEMBER
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] This application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application
No. 2013254934, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial
No. 61/724,273 filed 8 November 2012, the disclosures of both are incorporated by reference
herein in their entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002] The invention relates generally to orthodontic brackets and, more particularly, to self
ligating orthodontic brackets having movable closure members.
BACKGROUND
[0003] Orthodontic brackets represent a principal component of all corrective orthodontic
treatments devoted to improving a patient's occlusion. In conventional orthodontic treatments,
an orthodontist or an assistant affixes brackets to the patient's teeth and engages an archwire into
a slot of each bracket. The archwire applies corrective forces that coerce the teeth to move into
correct positions. Traditional ligatures, such as small elastomeric O-rings or fine metal wires,
are employed to retain the archwire within each bracket slot. Due to difficulties encountered in
applying an individual ligature to each bracket, self-ligating orthodontic brackets have been
developed that eliminate the need for ligatures by relying on a movable portion or member, such
as a latch or slide, for retaining the archwire within the bracket slot.
[0004] While such self-ligating brackets are generally successful in achieving their intended
purpose, there remain some drawbacks. By way of example, in some instances controlling the
rotation of the teeth, such as near the finishing stages of orthodontic treatment, can be
problematic. While there may be several factors that cause a reduction in rotational control, it is
believed that one of the major causes is the loose fit of the archwire within the archwire slot of
the bracket when the movable member is closed. When the movable member is closed, the
bracket body and the movable member collectively form a closed lumen for capturing the
archwire. A close fit between the lumen and the archwire is believed to be important for
achieving excellent rotational control during orthodontic treatment.

                                                    2
[0005] The close fit between the archwire and the archwire slot when the movable member is
closed may be affected by several factors including, for example, the tolerances of the
manufacturing process used to form the bracket body and the movable member. When the
orthodontic bracket is assembled, the various tolerances may "stack up" so as to provide a
relatively loose fit between the archwire and the closed lumen provided by the bracket body and
movable member. As noted above, such a loose fit is believed to result in a diminished capacity
to control the rotation of the teeth. In addition, to allow the movable member to move relative to
the bracket body between the opened and closed positions, there must be some clearance
between the bracket body and the movable member. In other words, there are typically some
tolerances in the manufacturing that provide a clearance. Yet, these tolerances stack up to
provide a lumen which may vary significantly in its labial-lingual dimension between brackets
and therefore may provide a relatively loose fit with the archwire in some instances.
[0006] Thus, while self-ligating brackets have been generally successful, manufacturers of such
brackets continually strive to improve their use and functionality. In this regard, there remains a
need for self-ligating orthodontic brackets that provide improved rotational control during
orthodontic treatment, such as during the finishing stages thereof.

[0016] In one embodiment, the bracket body further includes an aperture that is asymmetric

is at least in the closed position.
[0022] In one embodiment, the archwire slot includes a base surface and a first slot surface and
a second opposing slot surface that each extends outwardly from the base surface. The bracket

is in the closed position, a gap is formed between the leading surface and one of the first slot
surface and the second slot surface.
[0024] In one embodiment, the bracket body further includes a shoulder that is oriented at a
transverse angle relative to the slide track, and the slide member abuts the shoulder when the

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0041] Referring now to the drawings, and to Figs. 1 and 2 in particular, an orthodontic bracket
10 includes a bracket body 12 and a movable closure member coupled to the bracket body 12. In
one embodiment, the movable closure member may include a slide member or a ligating slide
14 slidably coupled with the bracket body 12. The bracket body 12 includes an archwire slot 16
formed therein configured to receive an archwire 18 (shown in phantom) for applying corrective
forces to the teeth. The ligating slide 14 is movable between a closed position (Fig. 1) in which
the archwire 18 is retained within the archwire slot 16, and an opened position (Fig. 2) in which
the archwire 18 is insertable into the archwire slot 16. The bracket body 12 and ligating slide 14
collectively form an orthodontic bracket 10 for use in corrective orthodontic treatments.
[0042] In addition to the above, the orthodontic bracket 10 further includes a resilient member
coupled to the ligating slide 14 and configured to engage at least a portion of the bracket body
12. As explained in more detail below, the resilient member, which in one embodiment includes

                                                   9
a tubular pin 20 (shown in Fig. 2), provides a force for biasing the ligating slide 14 in the
direction of the sliding or translational motion of the ligating slide 14. While the resilient
member is shown herein as a tubular pin, the invention is not limited to this particular
configuration, as other resilient members may be configured in accordance with the invention
disclosed herein. It is believed that providing a biasing force in conjunction with the structural
features of the orthodontic bracket 10, as described below, reduces the effects of tolerance
variations of the archwire slot 16. By limiting the tolerance variation, the working dimensions of
the archwire slot 16 may be more precisely known. This ultimately allows the clinician to more
precisely predict and control tooth movement with the orthodontic bracket 10. It will be
appreciated that improving the clinician's control of tooth movement may comparatively reduce
treatment time for a particular patient.
[0043] The orthodontic bracket 10, unless otherwise indicated, is described herein using a
reference frame attached to a lingual surface of an anterior tooth on the lower jaw.
Consequently, as used herein, terms such as labial, lingual, mesial, distal, occlusal, and gingival
used to describe bracket 10 are relative to the chosen reference frame. The embodiments of the
invention, however, are not limited to the chosen reference frame and descriptive terms, as the
orthodontic bracket 10 may be used on other teeth and in other orientations within the oral
cavity. For example, the bracket 10 may also be coupled to the labial surface of the tooth and be
within the scope of the invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the
descriptive terms used herein may not directly apply when there is a change in reference frame.
Nevertheless, embodiments of the invention are intended to be independent of location and
orientation within the oral cavity and the relative terms used to describe embodiments of the
orthodontic bracket are to merely provide a clear description of the embodiments in the
drawings. As such, the relative terms labial, lingual, mesial, distal, occlusal, and gingival are in
no way limiting the invention to a particular location or orientation.
[0044] When mounted to the lingual surface of a tooth T carried on the patient's lower jaw
(shown in Fig. 1) and with reference specifically to Fig. 3, the bracket body 12 has a lingual side
22, an occlusal side 24, a gingival side 26, a mesial side 28, a distal side 30, and a labial side 32.
The labial side 32 of the bracket body 12 is configured to be secured to the tooth in any
conventional manner, such as for example, by an appropriate orthodontic cement or adhesive or
by a band around an adjacent tooth. In one embodiment shown in Figs. 1-3, the labial side 32
may further be provided with a pad 34 defining a bonding base that is secured to the surface of

                                                  10
the tooth T. The pad 34 may be coupled to the bracket body 12 as a separate piece or element, or
alternatively, the pad 34 may be integrally formed with the bracket body 12. Further, the pad 34
may be specifically shaped to fit on the surface of a particular lingual tooth surface. The pad 34
may therefore have a multitude of configurations different from that shown in Figs. 1-3. It will
be appreciated that embodiments of the present invention are not limited to any particular
configuration of the pad 34.
[0045] With reference to Figs. 1 and 2, the bracket body 12 includes a base surface 36 and a pair
of opposed slot surfaces 38, 40 projecting lingually from the base surface 36 that collectively
define the archwire slot 16, which may extend in a mesial-distal direction from mesial side 28 to
distal side 30. The base surface 36 and slot surfaces 38, 40 are substantially encapsulated or
embedded within the material of the bracket body 12. In one embodiment, one or more of the
base surface 36 and slot surfaces 38, 40 are defined by corresponding rails 36a, 36b, 38a, 38b,
40a, and 40b which may be separated by corresponding recesses 42, 44, and 46. It will be
appreciated that any single pair of rails 36a and 36b, 38a and 38b, and 40a and 40b (Fig. 3) may
provide two points of contact between the bracket body 12 and the archwire 18 along the
corresponding archwire slot surfaces 36, 38, and 40.
[0046] As shown in Fig. 3, in one embodiment, the bracket body 12 further includes a slide
support portion 48 configured to receive the ligating slide 14 thereon. The slide support portion
48 may generally project lingually from or be oriented perpendicular to the pad 34. The slide
support portion 48 defines a support surface 50 to slidably engage the ligating slide 14 over at
least a portion of its translational motion from the closed position to the opened position. In a
lingual application, as shown in Fig. 1, the support surface 50 is positioned occlusally of the
archwire slot 16 and extends in a generally occlusal-gingival direction.
[0047] With reference now to Fig. 4, the slide support portion 48 may be tapered in the labial
lingual direction. In the configuration shown, the slide support portion 48 may have a first
mesial-distal width, WI, at a location proximate the pad 34 and a second mesial-distal width,
W2, proximate the support surface 50. The width W2 may be greater than the width WI to form
a wedge or dovetail shape. The dovetail shape may inhibit or resist labial-lingual movement of
the slide 14 relative to the bracket body 12 due to an interference fit between the width W2 and
a narrowest dimension of a channel in the slide 14, as is described in more detail below. It is
believed that the wedge-shaped configuration of the slide support portion 48 may aid in the

                                                   11
retention of the ligating slide 14 on the bracket body 12 in the event that the resilient member 20
fails in some manner. While the support surface 50 may have an arcuate configuration, as
shown, the support surface 50 may be planar or have other configurations without departing
from the invention as disclosed herein.
[0048] With reference to Fig. 5, the slide support portion 48 includes an aperture 52 formed as a
through bore in the mesial-distal direction. The aperture 52 may be positioned so that the
longitudinal axis of the resilient member 20 extends generally parallel with the archwire slot 16
and in the mesial-distal direction. In one embodiment, the aperture 52 is a generally
asymmetrical bore about a plane that is perpendicular to the direction of slide motion as
indicated by arrow 54 shown in Fig. 2. The aperture 52 may be described as having an irregular
configuration.
[0049] As will be described in detail below, the aperture 52 is configured to slidably engage the
resilient member 20 to bias the ligating slide 14 in the direction of slide translational movement.
In particular, when the slide 14 is in the closed position, as is shown in Fig. 1, the aperture 52 in
conjunction with the resilient member 20 and the slide 14 produces a net force on the slide 14 in
the gingival direction (e.g., in the closed direction). This net force must then be overcome, in
addition to other forces described below, before the slide 14 can be moved away from the closed
position or, according to Fig. 1, in the occlusal direction or toward the opened position. The net
force maintains the slide 14 in a fixed, more stable position relative to the bracket body 12
thereby maintaining a more consistent labial-lingual archwire slot dimension. In other words,
stack up tolerances in the labial-lingual direction are reduced or eliminated.
[0050] As shown in Fig. 5, the aperture 52 may include a first lobe portion 56 proximate the
occlusal side 24. By way of example only, the first lobe portion 56 may define a generally
circular perimeter along a portion of the aperture 52. The lobe portion 56 may be defined by an
axis 58 and a radius RI. The aperture 52 may further include a second lobe portion 60 proximate
the archwire slot 16. Similar to the first lobe portion 56, the second lobe portion 60 may be
defined by a generally circular perimeter having axis 62 and a radius R2.
[0051] In one embodiment, the aperture 52 may include a central portion 64 positioned between
and connecting the first lobe portion 56 and the second lobe portion 60. The central portion 64
may include a first segment 66 that is tangent to the first lobe portion 56 and that is also tangent

                                                   12
to the second lobe portion 60. The first lobe portion 56, the second lobe portion 60 and the first
segment 66 may generally define a slide track 70 for the resilient member 20. As is generally
indicated in Fig. 5, a projection of the slide track 70 may form an acute angle 01 with the base
surface 36 of the archwire slot 16.
[0052] In addition, the central portion 64 may include a second segment 68 opposite the first
segment 66. The second segment 68 may be tangent to the first lobe portion 56, but may extend
in a direction such that an extension of the second segment 68 would intersect (rather than be
tangent to) the second lobe portion 60. By further extending the second segment 68, it intersects
the first segment 66. The angle formed between the first and second segments 66, 68 may be
equal to or less than about 600 and may depend on a particular tooth onto which the bracket 10
is to be affixed. By way of example, the second segment 68 may be angled at between about 10'
and about 300 with respect to the first segment 66, and by way of further example, the second
segment 68 may be angled from about 190 to about 210 with respect to the first segment 66.
[0053] In one embodiment, the orientation of the first segment 66 and the second segment 68 of
the central portion 64 forms a restriction or pinch point 72 between the first lobe portion 56 and
the second lobe portion 60. The pinch point 72 is generally a narrowing of the aperture 52
between the first and second lobe portions 56, 60. This may include narrowing of the aperture
52 to a dimension that is less than each of the largest height (or labial-lingual) dimensions for
the first and second lobe portions 56, 60. By way of example only and not limitation, where
each of the first and second lobe portions 56, 60 generally define circular bores having radii RI
and R2, respectively, the pinch point 72 may be measured as a perpendicular distance between
the first segment 66 and the nearest opposing portion of the central portion 64. This
perpendicular distance may be less than the diameter of the first lobe portion 56 or less than the
diameter of the second lobe portion 60 or less than each of the diameters of the first lobe portion
56 and the second lobe portion 60. Further, this dimension may be at least 5% less or in the
range of about 10% to about 20% less than either diameter of the first or second lobe portions
56, 60. In one embodiment, the radius R2 is less than the radius RI and the pinch point 72 is
sized to be less than twice R2. By way of example and not limitation, radius R2 may be about
5% to about 15% less than radius RI. In an exemplary embodiment, the radius RI may be about
0.0 10 inches and the radius R2 may be about 0.009 inches and the pinch point 72 may measure
about 0.017 inches.

                                                   13
[0054] As set forth above, the aperture 52 may be asymmetric. The asymmetry may be a result
of the pinch point 72 being offset from a halfway point of the overall length of the aperture 52.
As shown in Fig. 5, pinch point 72 is shifted toward the second lobe portion 60. Based on this
shift alone, the aperture 52 is asymmetric about a plane that forms a perpendicular bisector of
the overall length of the aperture 52. In addition, in embodiments where the first and second
lobe portions 56, 60 are generally circular, the difference in corresponding radius dimension also
produces asymmetry in the aperture 52. The asymmetry in the aperture 52 may produce a
distinctive tactile response in the movement of the slide 14. In particular, as set forth in detail
below, the asymmetry in the aperture 52 may provide the clinician with a distinctive "click" or
"snap" to indicate that the slide 14 is in closed position.
[0055] With continued reference to Figs. 4 and 5, in one embodiment of the invention, the
bracket body 12 has at least one shoulder 74 oriented at an angle relative to the slide track 70.
The shoulder 74 may extend in a generally mesial or distal direction from the slide support
portion 48. It will be appreciated, however, that embodiments are not limited to the shoulder 74
in the configuration shown. In this regard, surfaces that abut the slide 14 may include another
surface that has at least a component thereof oriented perpendicular to the slide track 70.
[0056] In the exemplary embodiment shown, there are two shoulders, that is, a mesial shoulder
74 and a distal shoulder 76. One shoulder 74, 76 extends from each side of the slide support
portion 48. With reference to Figs. 4 and 5, the mesial shoulder 74 and distal shoulder 76 are
angled relative to the slide track 70 and generally face in the occlusal direction. By way of
example, the relative orientation of one or both of the shoulders 74, 76 may be similar to or the
same as that of the base surface 36 relative to the slide track 70. In one embodiment, each
shoulder 74, 76 is generally parallel with the base surface 36. As is shown in Fig. 7, one or more
of the shoulders 74, 76 may form a stop against which the slide 14 resides when it is in the
closed position.
[0057] With reference to Figs. 3 and 6, the ligating slide 14 is generally a U-shaped
configuration. The ligating slide 14 includes a first leg or mesial portion 80 and second leg or a
distal portion 82 that generally define a slide channel 84 therebetween. The slide channel 84 is
dimensioned to slidably cooperate with the slide support portion 48. In one embodiment, as
shown in Fig. 6, the slide channel 84 is narrowest at opposing projections 86, 88 adjacent the
labial-most edge of each of the mesial and distal portions 80, 82. The slide channel 84 may

                                                 14
therefore have a wedge shaped or dovetail configuration that compliments or corresponds to the
shape of the slide support portion 48 of the bracket body 12.
[0058] In one embodiment, the distance between the projections 86, 88 is less than the width
W2 of the slide support portion 48 (shown in Fig. 4) but is slightly greater than width WI. In
this case, the slide 14 is assembled with the bracket body 12 by a sliding motion from beyond
the occlusal side 24 of the bracket body 12 in a direction toward the archwire slot 16. This is
generally indicated in Fig. 3 by arrow 90. As set forth above, the wedge-shaped or dovetail
configuration of the slide support portion 48, in cooperation with the similarly wedge-shaped or
dovetail configuration of the slide channel 84, may inhibit or eliminate instances where the slide
14 accidentally disengages from the bracket body 12 in an outward or lingual direction in the
event that the resilient member 20 fails.
[0059] With reference to Fig. 6, each of the mesial and distal portions 80, 82 includes at least
one through bore that receives the resilient member 20. As shown, the mesial portion 80
includes a mesial through bore 92 and the distal portion 82 includes a distal through bore 94.
The bores 92, 94 share a common axis 95. As shown in Fig. 3, the resilient member 20 is
positioned in through bore 92 and through the aperture 52 and into the opposing bore 94 along
axis 95. By this construction, the resilient member 20 may provide a mechanism for securing the
ligating slide 14 to the bracket body 12 in one or both of the opened and the closed positions. In
one embodiment, the resilient member 20 cooperates with the bracket body 12, and more
particularly extends through the aperture 52, to secure the slide 14 to the bracket body 12 in
each of the opened and the closed positions. It will be appreciated that the bore 92 and the bore
94 may be sized to be slightly larger than the diameter or equivalent dimension of the resilient
member 20. By way of example, the bores 92, 94 may be about 0.002 inches larger in dimension
than the largest corresponding outer dimension of the resilient member 20. By way of further
example, the bores 92, 94 may measure from about 10% to about 20% larger than the
corresponding outer dimension of the resilient member 20.
[0060] In one embodiment, the ligating slide 14 includes mesial and distal engagement portions
96 and 98 formed along the lingual-most portion of each of the mesial and distal portions 80 and
82, respectively. In one embodiment shown in Figs. 1 and 7, portions of each of the engagement
surfaces 96, 98 oppose the base surface 36 when the ligating slide 14 is in the closed position
and thereby form a fourth side of the archwire slot 16. In this regard, in the embodiment shown

                                                  15
in Fig. 1, the engagement surfaces 96, 98 form the lingual boundary of the archwire slot 16 to
capture the archwire 18 in the archwire slot 16 during orthodontic treatment.
[0061] In addition, in one embodiment, the engagement surfaces 96, 98 abut the mesial and
distal shoulders 74, 76 when the ligating slide 14 is in the closed position. As introduced above,
the resilient member 20 may bias the slide 14 in the direction of translational motion of the slide
14. This may include biasing of the slide 14 in a direction toward the archwire slot 16. Because
the ligating slide 14 may be biased by resilient member 20 in the direction of slide 14 motion,
the tolerance variations in the ligating slide 14 are no longer relevant in setting the depth of the
archwire slot 16 in the generally labial-lingual direction. This is because regardless of the
magnitude of tolerance variation, the ligating slide 14 will always be engaged against the
shoulders 74, 76 of the bracket body 12 during normal orthodontic treatment. Thus, the
tolerance variation that must still be considered and monitored during manufacturing is the
tolerance in the positioning of the shoulders 74, 76 relative to the base surface 36 of the
archwire slot 16. Advantageously, this reduces the number of tolerances that stack up to
ultimately determine the depth of the archwire slot 16 in the generally labial-lingual direction
and thereby provides a more consistent fit between the lumen, created by the bracket body 12
and ligating slide 14, and the archwire 18. It is believed that rotational control of the teeth may
be more consistently maintained and predictable during orthodontic treatment.
[0062] In addition, as is shown in each of Figs. 1, 6, and 7, in one embodiment, the engagement
surfaces 96, 98 do not extend the full width or perpendicular distance of the archwire slot 16. In
this regard, mesial and distal portions 80, 82 further include generally lingually oriented leading
surfaces 100, 102. In the embodiment shown, the leading surfaces 100, 102 do not abut the
opposing surfaces of the bracket body 12, as is shown best in Fig. 7. For example, surfaces 100,
102 do not contact the opposing slot surface 40 or, when present, either of the rails 40a, 40b.
Accordingly, there remains a gap 104 between the bracket body 12 and the ligating slide 14 at
this location. The gap 104 may be intentional and necessary to assure that the ligating slide 14 is
consistently positioned relative to the base surface 36 or, when present, relative to the rails 36a,
36b.
[0063] By building in a gap at this location, contact between the engagement surfaces 96, 98 of
the ligating slide 14 and the shoulders 74, 76 of the bracket body 12 during treatment is more
probable or likely. It will be appreciated that reducing the number of other points of contact

                                                   16
between the ligating slide 14 and the bracket body 12 increases the likelihood that the ligating
slide 14 is more consistently positioned relative to the bracket body 12. Specifically, limiting
contact with other locations or providing a built-in gap at other locations increases the
probability of consistent contact between the engagement surfaces 96, 98 and the shoulders 74,
76. By way of example, the gap 104 may be at least about 0.001 inches, and by way of further
example, the gap 104 may measure in the range of about 0.001 inches to about 0.005 inches. It
will be appreciated, however, that the maximum dimension of the gap 104 may only be limited
by the minimum extension of the engagement surfaces 96, 98 required to capture the archwire
18 within the archwire slot 16.
[0064] With further reference to Fig. 6, another gap or clearance may be built in between the
slide 14 in the bracket body 12. In one embodiment, each of the mesial and distal portions 80, 82
is defined by surfaces 105 and 106. As shown in Fig. 7, the surfaces 105 and 106 oppose the pad
34 but do not slidably engage or contact the pad 34 when the ligating slide 14 is in the closed
position. In this regard, there is a built-in gap 108 between the ligating slide 14 and the pad 34.
Specifically, between the surface 105 and the pad 34 and between the surface 106 and the pad
34. By way of example, and not limitation, the gap 108 may be similarly dimensioned as the gap
104 between the surfaces 100, 102 and the slot surface 40, as set out above. Specifically, the gap
108 may measure at least about 0.001 inches, and by way of further example, may measure from
about 0.001 inches to about 0.005 inches when the ligating slide 14 is in the closed position.
[0065] In one embodiment, the slide 14 contacts the bracket body 12 along only two lingually
oriented surfaces. One contact surface is the support surface 50 and the other surface is one of
the shoulders 74 or 76. Where both shoulders 74, 76 contact the slide 14, there are only three
surfaces of contact between the slide 14 and the bracket body 12. By providing only a limited
number of contact points, the position of the slide 14 relative to the bracket body 12 is more
consistent, as is set out above.
[0066] In one embodiment, as depicted in Fig. 5, the bracket body 12 includes a tool clearance
recess 110. As shown in Fig. 5, the recess 110 is formed in the lingual surface of the slide
support portion 48 adjacent the support surface 50. In this regard, the support surface 50 extends
over only a portion of the slide support portion 48 with the recess 110 forming the remaining
portion thereof. The recess 110 may be configured as a generally planar surface displaced
labially from the support surface 50. The recess 110 cooperates with the slide 14 to provide

                                                    17
clearance between the slide support portion 48 and a tool (not shown) for moving the slide 14
toward the opened position.
[0067] In this embodiment, and with reference to Fig. 6, the ligating slide 14 further includes a
tool recess 112 formed in the leading surfaces 100, 102 and extending in a direction generally
toward the occlusal side 24. The tool recess 112 provides a region of increased clearance
between the slide 14 and the bracket body 12 when the slide 14 is in the closed position. The
tool recess 112 is configured to receive a tool (not shown) for opening the ligating slide 14. The
tool, such as a Spin TekTM tool from Ormco Corporation or a similar tool (the tool may be
configured for access to the lingual surface of a tooth) may therefore be inserted into the tool
recess 112 in a direction that is generally aligned with the archwire slot 16. Rotation of the tool
by 900 from the direction of insertion leverages the tool against the bracket body 12 at or near
the slot surface 40 and pushes the slide 14 toward the opened position. The recess 110 is
dimensioned to communicate with the tool recess 112 so that the tool clears the bracket body 12
as the slide 14 is moved toward the opened position and allows the tool to be fully rotated to 90'
from its orientation upon insertion into the tool recess 112. The relative position of the recess
110 and the tool recess 112 is shown best in Fig. 8A.
[0068] Additionally, in one embodiment, and with reference to Fig. 7, the bracket body 12 may
include a gingival tie wing 114. The ligating slide 14 may also include a tie wing 116. It will be
appreciated that the opposing tie wings 114, 116 may provide a region in which the clinician
may engage a ligature, for example, to provide additional pressure on the slide 14 to maintain it
against the bracket body 12 and in the closed position during treatment.
[0069] As introduced above, in one embodiment, and as illustrated in Fig. 3, the resilient
member 20 may be generally tubular having a circular cross section. The cross section may be
continuous, that is, the tubular resilient member 20 may be without slots or other discontinuities
in its sidewall. In this regard, and unlike a slotted tubular spring pin, the perimeter of the
resilient member 20 is generally maintained when the resilient member 20 is elastically
deformed. The member 20 may be dimensioned to fit within the bores 92, 94 and through the
aperture 52. In an exemplary embodiment, the resilient member 20 may be composed of Nickel
Titanium (NiTi) superelastic material. By way of example, one NiTi composition includes about
55 wt.% nickel (Ni), and about 45 wt.% titanium (Ti) with minor amounts of impurities and
which is available from NDC of Fremont, California. The mechanical properties of the NiTi

                                                  18
alloy may include an ultimate tensile strength of greater than about 155 ksi, an upper plateau of
greater than about 55 ksi, and a lower plateau of greater than about 25 ksi. The dimensions of
the resilient member 20 may vary depending on the size of the bracket itself. In one
embodiment, the resilient member 20 is a generally right circular hollow cylinder having an axis
118 and a diameter of about 0.016 inches and being from about 0.50 inches to about 0.125
inches in length. The wall thickness may measure from about 0.001 inches to about 0.004
inches, and may preferably be about 0.002 inches to about 0.003 inches. During assembly, the
resilient member 20 may be press fit or slip fit into bores 92, 94, and/or may be secured therein
to prevent relative movement therebetween using various processes including staking, tack
welding, laser welding, adhesives, or other suitable methods.
[0070] During use, and as is illustrated in the sequence of Figs. 8A-8D, when the ligating slide
14 is in the opened position, the resilient member 20 may be positioned within the first lobe
portion 56 (labeled in Fig. 5) of the aperture 52. The common axis 95 of each of the bores 92, 94
may be aligned with the axis 58 of the first lobe portion 56. The axis 118 of the resilient member
20 may also be aligned with the axis 58 depending on the cross-sectional dimensions of the
resilient member 20. Generally, in this position, and where each of the first lobe portion 56 and
bores 92, 94 are generally larger in dimension than the resilient member 20, the resilient
member 20 is in a relaxed, undeformed state and may not bias the ligating slide 14 in any given
direction. However, the resilient member 20 may resist external forces acting on the slide 14 in a
direction indicated by arrow 120 in Fig. 8A.
[0071] For example, where the bracket 10 is mounted on the lingual surface of a lower anterior
tooth (as shown in Fig. 1), gravity will tend to pull the slide 14 toward the closed position or in
the direction of the arrow 120 in Fig. 8A. Because the central portion 64 includes the segment
68, which provides a gradually decreasing clearance dimension that is less than the outside
diameter of the resilient member 20, the central portion 64 interferes with movement of the
resilient member 20 in the direction indicated by arrow 120. Advantageously, interference
between the segment 68 and the resilient member 20 limits the distance that gravity may move
the slide 14. The slide 14 therefore remains substantially in the opened position. It will be
appreciated that a clinician, after positioning the slide 14 in the opened position, may remove an
existing archwire from the archwire slot 16 and insert another archwire into the archwire slot 16
without concern that the ligating slide 14 will spontaneously move toward the closed position
under the influence of gravity.

                                                   19
[0072] Additionally, cooperation between the member 20 in the aperture 52 may require
intentional application of force to close the slide 14. A minimum threshold force may be
required on the slide 14 to move it toward the closed position. In one embodiment, the minimum
threshold force is greater than the sliding weight of the slide 14. In this embodiment, only when
the force on the slide 14 exceeds the minimum threshold force does the resilient member 20
move toward the closed position. Forces on the slide 14 that exceed the minimum threshold
force cause the resilient member 20 to elastically deform. Elastic deformation of the resilient
member 20 is dictated by the shape of the central portion 64 of the aperture 52. In this regard,
elastic deformation of member 20 may be localized to a region of contact with the aperture 52.
By elastic deformation, the strain produced in the resilient member 20 is fully recovered, and the
member 20 reverts to its original shape, upon removal of the deforming force.
[0073] Fig. 8B depicts an exemplary embodiment in which a force on the slide 14 exceeds the
minimum threshold force required to move the slide 14 toward the closed position. Where the
force on the slide 14 is sufficient to cause elastic deformation of the resilient member 20, the
slide 14 may be moved toward the closed position. It will be appreciated that depending on the
configuration of the second segment 68, a gradually increasing force may be required to
continuously move the slide 14 along the slide track 70 toward the closed position. The rate at
which the force is required to increase is dictated by the shape of the central portion 64 and the
properties of the resilient member 20.
[0074] For the exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 8B, the second segment 68 is a generally
planar surface and is believed to require a generally linear increase in force on the slide 14, at
least over a portion of the opening movement, to deform the resilient member 20 as shown. The
resilient member 20 may deform in a manner which allows it to conform to the shape defined by
the distances between the region of contact between the resilient member 20 and the first
segment 66 and the region of contact between the resilient member 20 and the second segment
68. As shown, the resilient member 20 may elastically deform by a change in the cross-sectional
profile of the member 20. This may include a change to a roughly egg-shaped cross section in
the region of contact between the resilient member 20 and the aperture 52. Portions of the
resilient member 20 outside of the aperture 52 may not significantly elastically deform and thus
retain their original cross-sectional profile. For example, the portions of the resilient member 20
in the bores 92, 94 may remain substantially circular. Thus, elastic deformation of the resilient
member 20 may be localized to discrete regions of the resilient member 20 in sliding contact

                                                  20
with the aperture 52. It will be appreciated that embodiments of the invention are not limited to
any particular form or shape of the resilient member 20.
[0075] With reference to Fig. 8C, the ligating slide 14 is moved closer to the closed position
under a force greater than the force required to deform the resilient member 20 as shown in Fig.
8B. At some force greater than the threshold force required to initially move the slide 14
towards the closed position, the force applied to the slide 14 is sufficient to conform the resilient
member 20 to the dimension of the pinch point 72. At this magnitude of force, the resilient
member 20 is elastically deformed in the region of contact with the aperture 52 so that the
resilient member 20 may at least partially squeeze through the pinch point 72. As shown, the
resilient member 20 may elastically deform to an egg-shaped cross section. At the pinch point
72, a leading portion 122 of the resilient member 20 may reside within the second lobe portion
60 while a remaining portion 124 of the resilient member 20 extends into the central portion 64.
The resilient member 20 may reside partially in each of the second lobe 60 and the central
portion 64. By way of example and not limitation, the force required to move slide 14 to a
position where the resilient member 20 partially enters the second lobe portion 60 may exceed
about 0.1 kgf (kilogram force), and by way of additional example, this force may be from about
0.2 kgf to about 0.8 kgf or from about 0.5 kgf to about 0.7 kgf, preferably about 0.6 kgf.
[0076] With reference to Figs. 8A-8C, the magnitude of the force required to overcome the
threshold force and/or the threshold sliding force as the ligating slide 14 moves away from the
opened position depends on the configuration of the aperture 52. This force may therefore be
selectively varied by changing the configuration of the aperture 52. In this regard, the angle of
intersection between the second segment 68 and the first segment 66 may be increased to
provide a desired opening force and/or sliding force and the rate at which that force may be
increased. Furthermore, the position of the pinch point 72 may be selected to provide a shorter
or longer central portion by which the rate of force increase may be changed. The shape of the
first and/or second segments 66, 68 may be generally planar to provide a linearly increasing
sliding force when the resilient member 20 in the central portion 64. Alternatively, one or both
of the segments 66, 68 may be contoured or curved (not shown) to provide a variable sliding
force. The above-described methods for varying the opening and/or sliding force are exemplary.
[0077] Referring now to Fig. 8D, once the opening and/or sliding force meets or exceeds the
force required to move the resilient member 20 to a position that is at least partially through the

                                                   21
pinch point 72, the resilient member 20 may spontaneously slide or move the remainder of the
distance into the second lobe portion 60. That is, the leading and remaining portions 122, 124
may spontaneously move into the second lobe portion 60 in the absence of additional external
force. More specifically, once a threshold proportion of the resilient member 20 enters the
second lobe portion 60, the sliding movement of the resilient member 20 into the second lobe
portion 60 may proceed spontaneously. This movement may be accompanied by an audible
and/or a tactile "click" or "snap" when the resilient member 20 expands into the second lobe
portion 60. By this feature, the clinician may then be assured that the ligating slide 14 has
reached its closed position and will remain in the closed position under normal forces observed
during the orthodontic treatment.
[0078] It is believed that the elastic nature of the resilient member 20 causes a natural
inclination for the resilient member 20 to return to an undeformed or at least a less deformed
configuration than the deformed configuration of the resilient member 20 in the vicinity of the
pinch point 72. Thus, when a threshold portion of the resilient member 20 enters the second lobe
portion 60 of the aperture 52, the member 20 may spontaneously release internal elastic energy
(by virtue of its deformed condition). Such a release causes the resilient member 20 in the
vicinity of the pinch point 72 to move into and fill the second lobe portion 60 without
application of additional external force. In other words, only a fractional portion of the resilient
member 20 may enter the second lobe portion 60 when an external force is applied to the slide
14 to move the slide 14 to the pinch point 72. The resilient member 20 may move the remainder
of the distance into the second lobe portion 60 to revert to a configuration having less or no
elastic deformation.
[0079] In one embodiment, should an insufficient force be applied to the resilient member 20 so
that it fails to enter the second lobe portion 60, the slide 14 may move, in the absence of an
external force, toward the opened position because the resilient member 20 may gradually
expand into the larger regions of the central region 64 proximate the first lobe portion 56.
Ultimately, the resilient member 20 may enter the first lobe portion 56.
[0080] In one embodiment and with reference to Figs. 8D and 9, the ligating slide 14 is shown
in the closed position. However, the bores 92, 94 are not fully aligned with the second lobe
portion 60 of the aperture 52. In particular, while the slide 14 is in the closed position, the bores

                                                  22
92, 94 are offset from the second lobe portion 60. The offset may be in the occlusal direction or
in a direction away from the archwire slot 16.
[0081] In one embodiment, the axis 95 of the bores 92, 94 is at a greater distance from the
archwire slot 16 than the axis 62 of the second lobe portion 60. Nevertheless, even with an offset
relationship, the resilient member 20 may spontaneously expand into the second lobe portion 60
to release some of the elastic deformation produced by the pinch point 72. That is, less than
100% of the elastic deformation may be released. As a result, when in the second lobe portion
60, the resilient member 20 may be elastically deformed along its axis 118, due to the offset
between axis 62 and 95, as is shown in Fig. 9. It is believed that lack of alignment when the
bores 92, 94 are offset from the second lobe portion 60 causes the resilient member 20 to be
bowed or curved. So, while the resilient member 20 may spontaneously expand into the second
lobe portion 60, to release the stored elastic deformation energy from forced movement from the
opened position to the pinch point 72, the resilient member 20 may retain some elastic
deformation in the closed position. However, the amount of elastic deformation may be less than
the amount observed at the pinch point 72.
[0082] As set out above, once the slide 14 is in the closed position (Fig. 8D), the elastic
deformation in the resilient member 20 produces a bias in the slide 14 in the direction of motion
of the slide 14, for example, in the direction of the archwire slot 16. The bias in the resilient
member 20 must be overcome before the slide 14 is movable toward the opened position.
Because the applied force must first overcome the bias that is the result of elastic deformation of
the resilient member 20, the resilient member 20 provides more consistent contact between the
slide 14 and the bracket body 12. For example, the bias may provide more consistent contact
between the engagement surfaces 96, 98 and the shoulders 74, 76. Advantageously, the depth of
the archwire slot 16 in the generally labial-lingual direction is determined by the position of the
shoulders 74, 76 relative to the base surface 36 of the archwire slot 16. Due to the biasing of the
ligating slide 14 against shoulders 74, 76 other tolerance variations may no longer have a
bearing on the close fit between the archwire slot lumen and the archwire 18.
[0083] Fig. 10 illustrates data representing the forces required to move a slide member
according to one embodiment of the invention from the opened to the closed position. A
machine available from Instron Corporation, Noorwood, MA, was used to collect the data
illustrated in Fig. 10. Generally, the top curve is compressive load observed during closing of

                                                  23
the slide member, the bottom curve is the compressive load observed during opening of the slide
member.
[0084] While the present invention has been illustrated by a description of various preferred
embodiments and while these embodiments have been described in some detail, it is not the
intention of the inventor to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such
detail. Additional advantages and modifications will readily appear to those skilled in the art. By
way of example, while the embodiments described herein show the resilient member pushing
the ligating slide in the direction of the slide motion, the resilient members may be configured to
pull the ligating slide toward the base surface of the archwire slot.
[0085] Thus, the various features of the invention may be used alone or in any combination
depending on the needs and preferences of the user.
