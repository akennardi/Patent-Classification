                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
             The present invention is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application
 5 No. 2013209317, and is further related to Australian Patent Application No.
   2011202649 and Australian Patent Application No. 2010200426. The contents of
   these applications are herein incorporated by cross reference.
             This invention relates to a valve assembly. In particular, the invention relates to
   a valve assembly used to protect fuel tanks from being overfilled with fuel and
10 therefore the invention will be described in this context. However, it is envisaged that
   the valve assembly may be used to protect the other types of containers from being
   overfilled with other types of fluid.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
15           For many years large machinery fitted with fuel tanks have been equipped with
   fast fill systems to enable rapid filling of large capacity fuel tanks. The existing fast fill
   fuel systems rely on an air vent that prevents air from escaping the fuel tank when the
   required level of fuel has been attained. This causes pressure in the fuel tank to
   increase to a level that automatic shuts-off a fuel supply nozzle.
20           A major concern of this system is that when the fuel level activates the shut-off
   for the fuel supply nozzle, the shut-off can be overridden and fuel can continue to be
   forced into the fuel tank above the normal level. This can cause the fuel tank to rupture
   from the high pressure attained when filling.
             US Patent No. 6,311,723, (by the applicant), has addressed this problem by
25 devising a flow control valve assembly that prevents the build up of pressure within the
   fuel tank during and after filling. The flow control valve assembly also prevents the
   supply fuel nozzle from being overridden thus preventing the possibility of overfilling.
   US Patent No. 6,311,723 is hereby incorporated by reference.
             The control valve assembly of US Patent No. 6,311,723 uses float valve to
30 determine when the level of fuel in the fuel tank is at a desired level. When the desired
   level of fuel has been attained, the float valve is used to block the flow of fuel through a
   bleed pipe to stop the flow of fuel through a control valve. An open breather is provided
                                                                      10323146_1 (GHMatters) P87219.AU.13 7/06/18

                                                - 2
   within the fuel tank to allow gas to escape from the fuel tank during filling to prevent the
   fuel tank rupturing.
           The flow control valve assembly operates very effectively on machinery that is
   predominately stationary. However, when the control valve assembly is mounted to
 5 vehicles' fuel tanks, such as those located in trucks and excavators, some difficulties
   may be experienced during movement of the vehicle.
            One problem that may be experienced is that the float valve may become
   broken. The float valve comprises a float that is mounted on a pivotally movable
   elongate arm. This arm can break due to the large forces that are exerted on the arm
10 by the surging fuel caused by movement of the vehicle.
            In the event that the control valve assembly fails, in this or any other manner,
   the fuel supply nozzle will continue to fill the tank and pass fuel through the open
   breather until the nozzle is shut-off manually. This may lead to many hundreds or even
   thousands of litres of fuel being wasted and the spilt fuel being disposed.
15         Another problem that occurs is fuel is passed through the open breather during
   movement of the vehicle. Fuel surges cause fuel to flow through the open breather and
   escape the fuel tank. Again, this wastes fuel and is environmentally unfriendly. Further,
   the spilt fuel also creates a fire vehicle hazard.

               DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
            FIG. 1 shows a valve assembly 10 that is primarily used in a fuel tank 1. The
   valve assembly 10 is normally used in conjunction with a control valve 2, as described
   in US Patent No. 6,311,723, to prevent fuel from entering the fuel tank when the fuel
 5 tank has reached a predetermined level. FIG. 6 shows the valve assembly 10
   connected to the control valve 2 via a bleed pipe 3. The control valve 2 is connected to
   a fuel pump 4 and supply tank 5.
            The valve assembly 10 comprises a housing 20 that is hollow and substantially
   cylindrical in shape. The housing 20 has several fuel holes 21 located along its length
10 that allow fuel located within the fuel tank to pass in and out of the housing 20.
            An inlet 30 is provided at a lower end of the housing 20 through which passes
   fuel. The inlet 30 is fluidly connected to two separate screw threaded apertures 31 and
   32. The bleed pipe 3 is connected to one of the apertures 31 or 32. The bleed pipe is
   fluidly connected to the control valve to activate the control valve as disclosed in US
15 patent No. 6,311,723. The screw-threaded apertures 31 and 32 allow the bleed pipe to
   be connected outside or inside the fuel tank.
            An inlet float valve 40 is housed in a lower end of the housing 20. The inlet float
   valve 40 is formed from a inlet float 41 and stem 42. A valve seal 43 is located
   adjacent the end of the stem 42 for sealing the inlet 30.
20          The inlet float valve 40 is mounted within the housing so that the stem 42 can
   reciprocate between an open position, in which fuel is able to pass through the bleed
   pipe 3 and through the inlet 30 into the fuel tank 1, and a closed position that prevents
   the flow of fuel through the inlet.
         A fuel chamber 50 is located between the inlet 30 and the apertures 31 and 32.
25 The fuel chamber 50 provides a shelter 51 in which an end of the stem 42 is located
   when the inlet float valve 40 is in the open position.
         The top of the housing 20 is open so that a passageway 60 is provided between
   the inside and outside of the fuel tank. This allows gas to pass from within the fuel tank
   to the atmosphere so that the fuel tank does not rupture during filling of the fuel tank. A
30 relief plate 71 is positioned within an upper end of the housing 20. Breather holes 72
   are located within the relief plate 71. The breather holes 72 form part of the
   passageway 60.
                                                                    10323146_1 (GHMatters) P87219.AU.13 7/06/18

                                                - 5
        A breather float valve 80 is provided adjacent the breather holes. The breather
   float valve 80 is formed from a breather float 81 and a rod 82. A platform 83 and the
   relief plate 71 guide rod 82. The float 81 is able to reciprocate along the length of the
   rod 82 between the relief plate 71 and the platform 83. The rod 82 is fixed to the float
 5 81 with circlips.
        The breather float valve 80 is in an open position when the breather float 81 is
   located adjacent the platform 83 and gas is free to pass through the breather holes 72.
   The breather float valve 80 is in a closed position when the breather float 81 is located
   over the breather holes 72 and fuel cannot pass through the breather holes 72.
io      A relief valve 70 is formed adjacent a top end of the housing 20. The relief valve
   70 is formed from the relief plate 71, a spring 73 and a cap 74. The relief plate is able
   to move within a skirt 22 formed at the top of the housing 20. The skirt 22 has a
   number of circumferentially spaced relief holes 23. The spring 73 holds the relief plate
   at the base of the skirt 22. The spring 73 is held in position by a cap 74 that is located
15 over the housing 20.
         In use, the valve assembly 10 has a number of functions. In a fuelling normal
   operation, the inlet float valve 40 is in the open position such that the stem 42 sits
   within the shelter 51 as shown in FIG. 1. The bleed pipe 3 passes fuel in to the fuel
   chamber 50. The fuel then passes through the inlet 30, into the housing 20 and out the
20 fuel holes 21 into the fuel tank. Any turbulence that is created by the fuel passing
   through the fuel chamber 50 does not effect the valve seal 43 as it is located within the
   shelter 51.
        As the fuel tank fills with fuel, the passageway 60 of the housing 20 also fills with
   fuel to the same level. The inlet float 41 rises within the housing until the valve seal 43
25 blocks the inlet 30 as shown in FIG. 2. The pressure of the fuel within the bleed pipe,
   as well as the fuel within the tank acting on float, maintains the valve seal 43 in position
   within the inlet 30. Once the inlet 30 is blocked, the bleed pipe 3 fills with fuel causing
   the control valve 2 to become closed and prevents further filling of the fuel tank.
        When the vehicle is moving, the housing 20 prevents damage of the inlet float
30 valve 40. The impact forces created by surging fuel within the fuel tank impact the
   housing 20 not the inlet float valve 40.
         However, the surging fuel can still extend up passageway 60 and up to the
   breather holes 72. The breather float valve 80 prevents this surging fuel from escaping
                                                                   10323146_1 (GHMatters) P87219.AU.13 7/06/18

                                                  -  6
   through the breather holes 72 as the breather float 81 moves with the surging fuel
   blocking the breather holes 72 as shown in FIG. 2.
         The breather float valve 80 also provides a fail safe during fuelling of the fuel tank.
   If the bleed pipe 3 is severed or the control valve fails or the inlet float valve fails, then
 5 a fuel supply nozzle (not shown) will continue to pump fuel into the fuel tank. The fuel
   tank will fill with fuel until the breather float 81 moves to the closed position to block the
   breather holes 72. The continued fuelling of the fuel tank creates pressure within the
   fuel tank. When the fuel tank reaches a fuel nozzle shut off pressure, then the fuel
   supply nozzle will shut-off stopping the fuel tank from rupturing.
10          If the fuel supply nozzle does not shut off automatically due to a mechanical
   fault, then the fuel supply nozzle will continue to supply fuel to the fuel tank. This
   causes the pressure within the fuel tank to increase. At a pressure less than the
   rupture pressure of the tank, the pressure relief valve is opened as shown in FIG. 3.
   This occurs when the fuel tank pressure becomes greater than the spring pressure
15 causing the relief plate 71 to move upwardly until it passes over the relief holes 23 in
   skirt 22. Fuel then passes from the tank, through the relief holes 23, into the cap 74
   and through a cap hole 75. The fuel flowing from the cap 74 will indicate to an operator
   to shut the fuel supply nozzle off manually.
             FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 show a second embodiment of a valve assembly 10. In this
20 embodiment, a breather float valve spring 84 is mounted around the rod 82 on the
   modified platform 83 below the breather float 81. The breather float valve spring 84
   engages the breather float 81.
             The breather float valve spring 84 assists in moving the breather float 81 to the
   closed position in the event of a vehicle roll over. The breather float 81 is of sufficient
25 weight to compress the breather float valve spring 84 when the valve assembly is in a
   substantially vertical position.
             However, during a roll over, less force is applied by the breather float 81 on the
   breather float valve spring 84 when the valve assembly 10 moves from a substantially
   vertical position to a substantially horizontal position.
30           Therefore, the breather float valve spring 84 causes the breather float 81 to
   move to the closed position so that fuel cannot escape from the tank through the
   breather holes 72 in the event of a vehicle roll over.
             The valve assembly provides a number of advantages. Firstly, the valve
   assembly is not damaged by surging fuel making the valve assembly suitable for use in
                                                                      10323146_1 (GHMatters) P87219.AU.13 7/06/18

                                                - 7
   vehicles. Secondly, the breather float valve prevents fuel from escaping the valve
   assembly when the fuel surges within the fuel tank during movement of the vehicle.
   Thirdly, in the event of failure of the inlet float valve, control valve or bleed pipe, the
   breather float valve prevents the loss of fuel by blocking the breather holes causing
 5 pressure build up within the fuel tank and thus causing the fuel supply nozzle to shut
   off. Lastly, the pressure relief valve prevents the fuel tank from rupturing from over
   pressurising of the fuel tank.
           The valve assembly can be easily retro fitted or fitted into existing tanks. It is
   sized to fit into holes that are located in tanks for existing systems.
10          It should be appreciated that various other changes and modifications may be
   made to the embodiment described without departing from the spirit or scope of the
   invention.

   hole, wherein the relief plate includes at least one breather hole that forms part of the
   passageway; a breather float valve movable between an open position to allow gas to
15 pass through the at least one breather hole and a closed position that prevents liquid
   from passing through the at least one breather hole;
                    utilising the breather hole to allow gas to escape the container through
   the passageway;
                    utilising the relief valve of the valve assembly to relieve pressure in the
20 container by movement of the relief plate from the closed to the open position; and
                    utilising the breather float to prevent surging liquid in the container
   escaping through the breather hole by moving from its open position to its closed
   position.
    10.             The method of claim 9, wherein the container is a fuel tank and the
25  liquid is fuel.
    11.             The method of claim 11, wherein the container is arranged to be filled
    with fuel by a fast fill fuel system.
