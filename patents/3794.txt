                                                  2
common general knowledge in the relevant art in Australia, or elsewhere, on or before
the priority date of the disclosure and claims herein.
[0008]      The overall reaction of water splitting, 2H 2 0 -> 2H 2 + 02, produces 02 and H2
gases as end products. These gases need to be kept separate for later individual use
and to avoid production of an explosive gas mixture (Tributsch H. Photovoltaic hydrogen
generation /nt J Hydrogen Energy 2008;33:5911-30). There are several approaches to
the design of devices that can maintain separation of the two gases during electrolysis,
for example the use of a membrane to separate the electrode compartments. This also
minimizes cross-over of dissolved gases from one electrode to be recycled at other
electrode (loroi T, Oku T, Yasuda K, Kumagai N, Miyazaki Y. Influence of PTFE coating
on gas diffusion backing for unitized regenerative polymer electrolyte fuel cells. J Power
Sources 2003;124:385-9; and Marangio F, Pagani M, Santarelli M, Cali M, Concept of a
high pressure PEM electrolyser prototype. Int J Hydrogen Energy 201 1;26:7807-15.
[0009]      Although    the gases can be separated, new             issues arise with these
technologies e.g. cost, mechanical properties, high resistance through the membrane
and ultra pure water is needed for proper operation (Nieminen J, Dincer I, Naterer G.
Comparative performance analysis of PEM and solid oxide steam electrolysers.             Int J
Hydrogen Energy 2010;35:10842-50).               Alkaline zero gap electrolysers using OH
conducting membranes are also being considered (Pletcher D, Li X. Prospects for
alkaline zero gap water electrolysers for hydrogen production.         Int J Hydrogen Energy
2011;36:15089-104 ).
[0010]      In the traditional alkaline electrolyser, where a diaphragm is the only separator,
bubble formation inside and between the electrode and the separator is the major cause
of transport resistance. A number of suggestions on bubble management have been
made e.g. use of mechanical circulation of the electrolyte, use of (stable) additives to
reduce surface tension of the electrolyte so the bubble can leave the system easier and
modification of the electrode surface properties to be less attractive to the gas bubbles
(Zeng K, Zhang D.           Recent progress in alkaline water electrolysis for hydrogen
production and applications. Prog Energy Combust Sci 2010;36:307-26.)

                                              3
[0011]     One of the features of the 02 evolution reaction is that the dissolved oxygen
concentration at the electrode has to build up to a level sufficient to nucleate and form
small, high-pressure bubbles.     According to Laplace's equation: P = 2y/r, where P is
pressure in the bubble, y is the surface tension and r the radius of the bubble, near the
surface of an electrolyte, 02 bubbles with 0.1pm radius need to have a pressure of 14
atm at 250C.     The concentrations required not only produce overpotential at the
electrode (and thus inefficiencies in water splitting), but also represent a very reactive
environment that challenges the long term stability of many catalysts.
[0012]     Several reports have described efforts to improve water splitting cell efficiency
by addition of sacrificial agents or co-catalysts, modification of catalyst crystal structures
and morphology, and specific surface area (Kudo A, Miseki Y. Heterogeneous
photocatalyst materials for water splitting.    Chem Soc Rev 2009;38:253-78;           Kato H,

NaTa0 3 photocatalysts with high crystallinity and surface nanostructure.        J Am Chem
Soc 2003;125:3082-9; and          Osterloh   FE.   Inorganic   materials   as   catalysts   for
photochemical splitting of water. Chem Mater 2008;20:35-54.)
[0013]    A few reports have designed novel electrode architectures at the nano- or
micro-scopic scales to enhance cell performance (Mohapatra SK, Misra M, Mahajan VK,
Raja KS.    Design of a highly efficient photoelectrolytic cell for hydrogen generation by
water splitting: Application of Ti0 2-xCx nanotubes as a photoanode and Pt/Ti0                2

Enhanced solar water-splitting efficiency using core/sheath heterostructure CdS/Ti0           2
nanotube arrays. Nanotechnology 2007;18).
[0014]    Also, there have been attempts to separate the gases using different flow
streams of the electrolyte in a planar microfabricated device, but the device efficiency
was not high (Jiang L, Myer B, Tellefsen K, Pau S. A planar microfabricated electrolyzer
for hydrogen and oxygen generation. J Power Sources 2009;1_88:256-60).              It appears
that improvements, based on modification of the electrode structure, to rapidly remove
the 02 from the cell before the bubble is formed, has not yet been widely considered.
The traditional gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) of the type used in fuel cells have a
tendency to continue to form 02 bubbles when operating in water splitting devices (loroi

                                                4
T, Oku T, Yasuda K, Kumagai N, Miyazaki Y. Influence of PTFE coating on gas diffusion
backing for unitized regenerative polymer electrolyte fuel cells. J Power Sources
2003;124:385-9). Moreover, these electrodes are not stable under water oxidation (WO)
condition, the carbon being rapidly oxidized at the potentials involved in WO (Chaparro

electrodes in aqueous solution by means of membrane inlet mass spectrometry.            J

[0015]      In other prior art work a hydrophobic gas porous membrane (Goretex*) has
been used to develop an efficient three phase-interface structure for an air-electrode
(Winther-Jensen B, Winther-Jensen 0, Forsyth M, MacFarlane DR.             High rates of
oxygen reduction      over a vapour phase-polymerized        PEDOT electrode.    Science
2008;321:671-4). The advantage of this, as a substrate for an electrode, is that gas can
diffuse through the membrane, but liquid water cannot, and that an efficient three-phase
interface can be maintained during operation. The fact that the cell responds linearly to
the 02 content in the supplied gas in the 02 reduction reaction clearly proved that
efficient gas transportation through the electrode was achieved.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
[0016]      In one form the present invention seeks to provide a device, method and
process for the use of a hydrophobic membrane for electrolysis to directly separate the
evolved gases from the electrolyte solution.
[0017]      In another form the present invention seeks to improve the efficiency of
electrolytic reactions such as water splitting.
[0018]      In another form the present invention seeks to alleviate at least one
disadvantage associated with the related art.

                                               5
[0019]      In another form the present invention seeks to overcome or alleviate at least
one of the above noted drawbacks of related art systems or to at least provide a useful
alternative to related art systems.
[0020]      In a first aspect of embodiments described herein there is provided a water
splitting cell having at least one electrode comprising a porous membrane, wherein the
porous membrane is at least partly hydrophobic, and wherein gas produced at the at
least one electrode diffuses out of the cell via the porous membrane.
[0021]     The removal of produced gas across the porous membrane results in a device
capable of separating the gas from the reaction at the electrode. Note that the porous
membrane may also be a porous gas permeable membrane, if the appropriate phase
interface can be established. Greater than 90% of the gas produced at the at least one
electrode can be removed from the cell across the porous membrane. Desirably, and
greater than 95% and greater than 99% of the gas produced can be removed across the
porous membrane.
[0022]     The removal of gas from the reaction at the electrode without substantial
bubble formation permits the water splitting reaction to be achieved with a substantially
lower over potential, thereby increasing the efficiency of the water splitting cell.
[0023]       By the term "without substantial bubble formation" it will be understood that we
mean without substantial formation of bubbles visible to the naked eye. All bubbles are
"formed" very small and then grow as this is the preferred state because it lowers the
pressure in the bubble (according to Laplace's equation: P = 2y/r, where P is pressure in
the bubble, y is the surface tension and r the radius of the bubble). Small bubbles can
easily fuse to form bigger ones, thus leading to a range of bubble sizes. The water
splitting cell may be capable of operating without the substantial formation of gas
bubbles greater than 125 pm in diameter. In some embodiments, the water splitting cell
is capable of operating without the substantial formation of bubbles greater than 100 Pm
in diameter and without the formation of bubbles greater than 50 Pm in diameter. The
water splitting cell may, in particular embodiments permit operation without the formation
of gas bubbles.

[0024]      Separating the gas from the active area of the electrode without substantial
bubble formation facilitates the efficient operation of the water splitting cell.
[0025]      In a second aspect of embodiments described herein there is provided a water
splitting cell having a cathode comprising a porous membrane, wherein H2 gas produced
at the cathode diffuses out of the cell via the porous membrane, separating the H2 gas
from the cathodic reaction without bubble formation.
[0026]      In a third aspect of embodiments described herein there is provided a water
splitting cell having an anode comprising a porous membrane, wherein 02 gas produced
at the anode diffuses out of the cell via the porous membrane, separating the 02 gas
from the anodic reaction without bubble formation.
[0027]      In a fourth aspect of embodiments described herein there is provided a water
splitting cell having:
        *       a cathode comprising a first porous membrane,
        *       an anode comprising a second porous membrane,
        e       at least one electrolyte for immersion of the anode and the cathode,
wherein gas is produced at the electrodes without bubble formation and diffuses out of
the cell via the porous membranes.
[0028]      In a fifth aspect of embodiments described herein there is provided an
electrode for water splitting comprising a porous membrane associated with a model
catalyst.
[0029]      In a sixth aspect of embodiments described herein there is provided a water
splitting device according to the present invention comprising a porous membrane
associated with a model catalyst.

                                              7
[0030]     This catalyst may be chosen from known catalysts according to the reaction
occurring on the electrode.      Generally precious metals such as platinum, gold and
palladium can be used.       Further, suitable catalysts for water oxidation include: rare
elements such as Ru and Ir complexes, Mn complexes which have been studied
extensively as models of the oxygen-evolution-catalyst (OEC) but none of them is a pure
photo-catalyst, and abundant metals complexes such as Fe, NiOx and Co (See for
example, .X. Liu, F. Wang, Transition metal complexes that catalyze oxygen formation
from water: 1979-2010, Coordination Chemistry Reviews 256 (2012) 1115-1136; P. Du,

catalyst in neutral water containing phosphate and Co02 , Science 321 (2008) 1072-1075.
[0031]     For increasing stability, such metal-oxide catalysts may be containing an
additional element such as phosphorous.         For water reduction, conducting polymers
such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and polypyrrole, Co, Ni, a few Fe complexes
and MoSx have been reported as catalysts for water reduction reaction.         (P. Du, R.

will depend on operating conditions such as temperature, salinity and pH of the
electrolyte.
[0032]     In another embodiment the catalyst is platinum deposited on the porous
membrane.

                                                 8
[0033]      The cell of the present invention not only separates the gases and decreases
gas cross-over in the cell, but also facilitates a more favourable environment for the
operation of the catalyst. In general, increasing partial pressure of 02 in an electrolytic
cell causes increasing degradation of the catalyst, particularly the anode catalyst. Hence
the removal of 02 according to the present invention reduces this effect, permitting the
use of (photo) catalysts previously unsuitable such as CdS, CdSe, and GaAs.
[0034]       In one embodiment, the catalyst is tuned to produce the gas (hydrogen or
oxygen) at a rate that matches the flux across the membrane in order to enable complete
or near complete withdrawal of the gases without substantial bubble formation.
[0035]       It is desirable that the advancing contact angle of the porous membrane with
the electrolyte is greater than 900.
[0036]       In another embodiment the porous membrane is a hydrophobic membrane.
Suitable membranes          may have various pore sizes and pore shapes and                be
manufactured from various hydrophobic materials. The membranes may have a pore
size less than 0.5 pm, less than 0.1 pm or worse than 0.05 pm.
[0037]       In another embodiment, the porous membrane may or may not be hydrophobic
in nature but be coated with a thin film of hydrophobic material. Suitable hydrophobic
material may be rather or silicone and enhance the wet ability of the porous membrane
whilst still providing the requisite degree of breathability (having a sufficient flux of the
gas across the membrane). Other suitable thin-film coatings may be selected from the
group    consisting      of  silicone-fluoropolymer, polydimethylsiloxane   (PDMS)    or    its
copolymers, PDD-TFE (perfluoro-2, 2-dimethyl-1, 3-dioxole with tetrafluoroethylene) and
combinations thereof.
[0038]       In another embodiment, the porous membrane comprises hydrophobic,
conducting carbon material such as carbon fibre, graphene or carbon nanotubules.
[0039]      The Young-Laplace equation defining the capillary pressure, Pc, can be used
as guidance for selection of materials and pore size for the membrane. It states that the
capillary pressure (pc) is proportional to the surface tension (y) and inversely proportional

                                                  9
to the effective radius (r) of the interface, it also depends on the wetting contact angle (0)
of the liquid on the surface of the capillary.
        27 cos 0
            r
[0040]      As the contact angle approach 900 the capillary pressure goes towards zero
(and eventually changes sign) resulting in wetting of the membrane. This is theoretically
limiting possible membrane materials to those with a contact angle above 90*. Table 1
lists average surface tension and water contact angles for common hydrophobic
polymers. It should be taken into account that the production method and material grade
can result in some variation in contact angle.          For example, for polystyrene contact
angles up to 980 has been reported whereas the average is below 900.                 It will be
apparent to those skilled in the that only the part of the membrane that is in direct contact
with water needs to have the needed high contact angle and that this can be obtained for
example, by coating one side of a (hydrophilic) membrane with one of the polymers from
the list below. Some carbon materials (e.g. carbon fibre) have a contact angle higher
than 900 and may therefore be used directly as a conducting hydrophobic membrane.
However, adequate catalysts will have to be coated onto these carbon materials.

[0042]      The calculated capillary pressure of the membranes tested and found to be
suitable are ranging from -2500 Pa (Mitex (PTFE)) to -132000 Pa (Celgard 880 (PE)) and
thereby underlining the large design freedom for the choice of membranes. The negative
sign of the pressure values indicates that the capillary pressure is directed out of the

                                                12
pore and thereby preventing flooding of the membrane.                 These pressure values
corresponds well with measurements obtained from PTFE coated carbon paper
membranes ("Capillary pressures in carbon paper gas diffusion layers having hydrophilic
and hydrophobic pores" Liang Hao, Ping Cheng, International Journal of Heat and Mass
Transfer 55 (2012) 133-139). In an embodiment the capillary pressure of the membrane
will be below -5000 Pa.         For systems where water is dispersed or dissolved in a
hydrophobic electrolytes the considerations regarding capillary pressure will still be valid,
but in this case a hydrophilic membrane must be used to avoid solvent penetration into
the membrane.
[0043]      Combining the electrode of the present invention with catalysts and photo
catalysts of various types e.g. non-precious metal and metal oxides allows greater scope
for fabrication of cost efficient and straightforward water splitting electrolytic devices.
[0044]      Other aspects and forms are disclosed in the specification and/or defined in
the appended claims, forming a part of the description of the invention.
[0045]      In essence, embodiments of the present invention stem from the realization
that a breathable electrode structure can be used to directly separate gases in an
electrolytic reaction.

invention comprise the following:
        *      efficient removal of gases from the water splitting reaction with concomitant
               improvement in the efficiency of the system;
        *      the direct separation of gases negates the need for a separator;
       *       production of high purity gases;
       *       reduces the potential for produced hydrogen to be oxidised at the anode
               and for produced oxygen to be reduced at the cathode;

                                               13
         *      provides a more favourable environment for the operation of the catalyst;
         *     facilitates use of otherwise unsuitable catalysts that would be degraded as
                partial pressure of 02 increases;
         *     the direct separation of gases decreases gas cross over and thereby
                enhances columbic efficiency; and
         *     the    combination    of  the   electrode   with optimised   catalysed   and
                photocatalysts provides opportunities for fabrication of more cost efficient
                electrolytic devices

EXAMPLES
[0049]      The invention will be further described with reference to the following non
limiting examples.      More specifically, three membrane        electrodes with different
morphology and pore sizes and shapes were prepared and studied. Platinum, the most
well studied catalyst was used as the model catalyst material. However the electrodes of
the present invention should not be interpreted as being limited to this catalyst and can
be operated with many catalysts.

                                             15
Membrane treatment and Pt coating
[0050]     PTFE membranes (Goretex*) was obtained from Gore Inc and MitexTM
(10 pm) was obtained from Millipore. Au mylar (2.5 Ohm/square) was purchased from
CPFilms Inc.     Maleic anhydride was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.     Preparation of the
Goretex*, Mitex TM, polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) membranes prior to Pt
coating was similar to previous work described by Winther-Jensen et al entitled 'High
rates of oxygen reduction over a vapor phase-polymerized PEDOT electrode' in Science
2008;321:671-4.     Maleic anhydride was grafted onto the hydrophobic surface of the
membranes to ensure good bonding to the gold conducting layer, using plasma
polymerisation as earlier reported in the aforementioned article and by Ademovic Z et al,
in and article entitled 'Surface modification of PET films using pulsed AC plasma
polymerisation aimed at preventing protein adsorption' in Plasma Processes Polym
2005;2:53-63.     The gold was sputtered onto the plasma treated membranes and its
thickness was optimised to give a surface resistance ~ 5 Ohm/sq.        The Pt was then
sputtered on top of the gold layer at 28-30 mA for 60 sec. A traditional GDE was also
studied for comparison; this was an ionomer free (LT- 140EW-30% Pt on Vulcan XC-72,
0.5 mg cm- 2 ) from E-TEK and used as supplied. SEM images were obtained using a
JEOL 71 0OF Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscope at 5 kV.
Electrode Assembly
[0051]     The membrane was sandwiched with a gold strip using a conventional
laminator.   A 0.7 cm2 window in the laminate allowed access for electrolyte to the Pt
coated side of the membrane and for the gas to breathe out to the adjacent chamber
when mounted on the test cell with double-sided adhesive tape (Figure 1).
Experimental set-up and gas measurement
[0052]     Sodium p-toluene sulphonate (from Sigma Aldrich) 0.05 M pH 4 was used as
an electrolyte. 30ml of electrolyte was used in the test cell leaving 30 ml gas space
above the electrolyte.    A three electrode cell was set-up using a saturated calomel
reference electrode (SCE) and carbon rod or Pt counter electrode.        A multi-channel
potentiostat (VMP2 from Princeton Applied Research) was used for the constant-current

                                              16
electrolysis. The distance between the electrodes is 1.5 cm and the potential during
operation of all working electrodes was typically ~ 2-2.4 V vs SCE.
[0053]      The Micro-Oxygen Electrode was purchased from eDAQ and used to monitor
02  evolution from the electrolysis reactions. It was calibrated at 21% 02 in air and 0% 02
in pure nitrogen gas. The slope from the calibration was 10.3 mV equals 1% 02. The
amount of H2 was measured using gas chromatography (SRI 310C, MS-5A column,
TCD, Ar carrier).
RESULTS
[0054]      The test cell was set up as shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, the experiments were
focused on WO. Pt coated membrane was used as the anode and the liberated 02 was
monitored using a Micro-Oxygen Electrode placed in the chamber (60 ml) on the back
side of the membrane (Scheme 1). Several seconds after 10 mA current was applied to
the cell, bubbles started to form on the counter electrode (carbon rod). On the anode
side, bubbles were not observed on the working area when Goretex* membrane was
used. This suggested that the major portion of the 02 was able to escape to the back
side of the membrane. Some bubble formation was observed on the working area when
the other membranes were used.         The 02 content of the back side chamber steadily
increased during electrolysis for both        Pt-coated Au/ Goretex*     and Au/ MitexTM
electrodes, but remained unchanged for the GDE (Figure 2), suggesting no 02
production in the latter case. The studies by Chaparro et al (Chaparro AM, Mueller N,
Atienza C, Daza L. Study of electrochemical instabilities of PEMFC electrodes in
aqueous solution by means of membrane inlet mass spectrometry. J Electroanal Chem
2006;591:69-73) and Jang and Kim (Jang SE, Kim H. Effect of water electrolysis
catalysts on carbon corrosion in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. J Am Chem
Soc 2010;132:14700-1) support this observation with the GDE as they showed the
electrochemical oxidation of carbon on the GDE in presence of water at oxidative
potentials (Chaparro AM, Mueller N, Atienza C, Daza L. Study of electrochemical
instabilities of PEMFC electrodes in aqueous solution by means of membrane inlet mass
spectrometry. J Electroanal Chem 2006;591:69-73; and Jang SE, Kim H. Effect of water
electrolysis catalysts on carbon corrosion in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. J
Am Chem Soc 2010;132:14700-1).

                                              17
[0055]      The 02 evolution rate from the Pt-coated Au/ Goretex* electrode was the
highest, indicating that the coated Goretex* electrode is the most efficient in emitting
gaseous 02 from the WO reaction.
[0056]      Further investigation was performed by monitoring the 02 evolution in the head
space above the electrolyte, in the front chamber, during water splitting with the Pt
coated Au/ Goretex* electrode. The result (Figure 3) showed no measurable increase in
02  above the electrolyte, indicating a very high efficiency in removing it into the back
chamber. The Faradaic efficiency in these experiments was 90±3 %.
[0057]      In order to understand the "breathing" ability of each membrane, scanning
electron microscopy was performed as shown in Figure 4.
[0058]      As expected, Pt nanoparticles were well distributed on the membrane
surfaces. The images of the GDE showed dense, packed structure with Pt nanoparticles
ranging from 65 to 100 nm. The size of the sputtered Pt nanoparticles was in the range
of 30-40 nm on MitexTM and Goretex@ membranes. The MitexTM 10 pm images showed
inconsistent pore size and distribution, whereas Goretex* has a fine pore size (~ 1 x 10
pm) with consistent distribution. The Goretex* structure is believed to contribute to its
higher performance observed in the water splitting experiments.
[0059]      As a control experiment, a non-porous substrate consisting of Pt-coated Au
mylar was used as an anode in a single chamber set-up with the oxygen probe placed
above the electrolyte.      The 02 produced in this experiment was much lower (0.48
pmol/min) than when using the Pt-coated Au/ Goretex* (1.35 pmol/min) in the two
chambers set-up. The Faradaic efficiency from this control experiment was only 31%.
This indicates the degree of oxygen shuttling between the electrodes that are present in
this cell configuration, having no separator, when a non-porous electrode is used.
[0060]      In another experiment the Pt-coated Au mylar was used as the anode and Pt
coated Au/ Goretex* as the cathode, ie as the H2 producing electrode. There was no H2
bubble formation observed on the cathode. The Faradaic efficiency of 02 evolution in
this experiment was 61%. When Pt-coated Au/ Goretex* electrodes were used for both
anode and cathode, so that both gases were removed from the cell, the Faradaic

                                              18
efficiency was increased to 92%. H2 detected in this experiment was found to be close to
2:1 stoichiometric ratio within measurement error (± 7%).         This suggests that in an
optimized cell and gas flow configuration it may be practical to avoid the use of a
separator in these cells.
[0061]     Although Goretex@ initially was found to be the best among the three
membranes tested, certainly there are membranes with different hydrophobicity and
various pore sizes and shapes which can be used. A number of these possibilities were
tested in an additional experiment.        Here polyethylene (PE, Celgard 880 (0.1x1p
poresize)) and polypropylene (PP) mesh (5p poresize) and PP non-woven (5pi poresize)
membranes were tested in similar way as described above (see Figure 5). The Celgard
880 performed nearly as good as the Goretex@ as seen from the increase in oxygen
measured on the back chamber of the setup, which correspond to a faradaic efficiency of
82%. The two PP membranes were less efficient (51% and 41% respectively), however
clearly showed that this material can be used for the membrane structure.
Stability test of CdS on Ti/Au/Goretex and baseline test using Ti/Au/Goretex.
[0062]     CdS/Ti/Au/Goretex or Ti/Au/Goretex (0.5 cm2 ) was laminated and sandwiched
between two plastic bottles. The front chamber was filled up with 0.05 M NaPTS pH 6.75
30 ml. An oxygen sensor was placed in the gas chamber. Black cloth was used to cover
the plastic chamber to protect the light directly shining on the DO probe. Asahi lamp was
used to shine the light on the sample. Each data point was collected after the following
procedure: N2 gas was used to purged the electrolyte for about 15 min or until stable
baseline was achieved and in the same time 02 was flushed into the back chamber,
immediately after removal of N2 (and the hole was sealed) the light was shone on the
sample for 7 min, 02 was then removed (and the hole was sealed) with the light
continued to shine for another 5 min.      This process has been repeated for 39 cycles.
The 02 increased was monitored and typical graph was shown in Figure 6.
[0063]     The data was then plotted as the rate of 02 increased (increased in 02 reading
over, typically, 12 min light exposure) versus light exposed time (Figure 7). From Figure
7 it can be seen that the 02 evolution rate from CdS/Ti/Au/Goretex electrode was higher
than from the Ti/Au/Goretex baseline and stable for more than 8 hours.          This result

                                               19
should be compared to the usual degradation of CdS within several minutes under
light/oxygen evolution.
[0064]     The surface treatment, using polyacid and plasma polymerisation, is also a
vital step to ensure a good cohesion between the catalyst and the membrane.            It also
opens the route to deposit the catalyst onto hydrophobic membranes. The possibility of
merging this technology with some of the non-precious metal and metal oxide catalysts
(Pletcher D, Li X. Prospects for alkaline zero gap water electrolysers for hydrogen
production. Int J Hydrogen Energy 2011;36:15089-104) that have limited possible use in
PEM electrolysers will lead to a facile and cost efficient water splitting device. It is also
possible to use this approach to enhance the lifetime of photo-active electro-catalysts,
many of which are sensitive to the presence of oxygen bubbles.
