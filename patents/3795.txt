 IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO TRANSCATHETER STENT-VALVES
 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to the field of transcatheter stent-valves.       In
 some non-limiting aspects, the stent-valve may be a cardiac valve, for
example, an aortic valve.
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
Transcatheter valve implantation (for example, transcateter aortic valve
 implantation (TAVI)) is an evolving technology for replacement valve therapy
that (i) avoids the trauma of conventional open-chest surgery, and (ii) avoids
the need for heart and lung bypass.         In such a technique, a stent-valve is
compressed and loaded into a delivery catheter.          The delivery catheter is
introduced to the desired site of implantation (for example at the heart) via a
 percutaneous route or via minimally invasive surgery.          The stent-valve is
deployed into the implantation position from or by the delivery catheter, and
the delivery catheter is then withdrawn.
 Despite the successes of transcatheter stent-valves, technological challenges
 remain. One such challenge is preventing leakage of blood around the stent
valve (so called para-valve leakage). The above stents form a friction fit with
the native anatomy to anchor the stent-valve in position, and are round in
cross-section. However the native anatomy in which the stent is implanted is
 often off-round and is different for each person. Moreover, heavy calcification
of the native anatomy may obstruct full depolyment of any stent, and make
the native anatomy even more irregular.          It can sometimes be difficult to
 provide a perfectly sealing fit between the stent-valve and the surrounding
anatomy.
 In order to address para-valve leakage, it is known to incorporate an external
 skirt or cover as part of the stent-valve.     For example, the skirt is made of
compressible biocompatible material, such as paracardial tissue or PET. The
thicker the material of the skirt, the more able the skirt is to occlude gaps and

                                                   2
effect a seal. However, a disadvantage is that such skirts add to the bulk of the stent-valve. A
thick skirt makes the stent-valve problematic to compress to a desirably small size for
implantation.
It would be desirable to provide a technique for mitigating para-valve leakage without
substantially hindering the compressibility of a stent-valve.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Aspects of the invention are defined in the claims.
A stent-valve for transcatheter implantation to replace a cardiac valve, the stent-valve being
compressible to a compressed state for delivery, and expandable to an operative state for
implantation, the stent-valve comprising a stent, a plurality of leaflets for defining a prosthetic
valve, and an inner skirt communicating with the leaflets and carried on an interior of the stent, a
paravalve seal for sealing against surrounding tissue, wherein the paravalve seal comprises a
fibrous porous material.
Various embodiments present a seal for mitigating para-valve leakage (which may also be
referred to herein throughout as a seal or a para(-)valvular seal or a para(-)valvular leakage
seal). The seal may be of flexible and/or compliant material. For example, flexible and/or
compliant material may comprise natural tissue (e.g. pericardium,              such as porcine
pericardium or bovine pericardium), and/or synthetic material (e.g. silicone, PET or PEEK,
any of which may be in film form, or woven fabric form, or non-woven fabric/mesh form).
In some embodiments, the paravalve seal may be configured to be a substantially supra
annular seal (for example, above the level of a native annulus of the native valve), and/or a
substantially annular seal (for example, at the level a native annulus of the native valve),
and/or a substantially infra- annular seal (for example, below the level of a native annulus of
the native valve).
In some embodiments, a seal is carried by at least one seal support. Additionally or
alternatively, a (e.g. deployable) seal support is provided for deploying a seal.
In either case, in some embodiments, the seal support is collapsible to a stowed condition in
which the seal is relatively streamlined or compressed with respect to the stent, or to at least
a further portion of the stent, when the

                                       3
stent is compressed. (For example, in the stowed condition, the seal support
may be generally coplanar with a portion, such as a body portion, of the stent,
or may be arranged compressed against the stent or stent portion.) The seal
support may be deployable to a deployed condition in which the support holds
or biases the seal to a deployed state, for example, with respect to the stent
or at least the further portion of the stent previously referred to.  The seal
support may be self-deploying from the stowed condition to the deployed
condition. For example, the seal support may be constrainable in the stowed
condition by sheathing of the stent in a compressed state for delivery. The
seal support may be self-deploying from the stowed condition when the effect
of the constraining sheath is removed.    The seal support may be of shape
memory material, for example, shape memory metal alloy, for example nitinol.
Various forms and structure of seal support are envisaged.            In some
embodiments, the seal support, may be integral with the stent (e.g. integrally
formed as part of the stent). In other forms, the seal support may be distinct
from the stent. Such a seal support may optionally be coupled to or captive
on the stent.
The seal support may be configured to bear against the material of the seal
without penetrating through the seal material. For example, the seal support
may have a shape that distributes contact force.        A function of the seal
support may be to urge the seal outwardly without the seal support
penetrating through the seal material or into a tissue surface against which
the seal is desired.
In some embodiments, the seal support comprises a biasing element that
biases the seal, for example, to a deployed condition. The seal support (e.g.
biasing element) may comprise, for example, a cantilever element (or a
plurality of cantilever elements).  Each cantilever element may comprise a
single strut, or plural struts (for example, first and second struts coupled
together at an apex or a tip of the cantilever element).        The cantilever
elements may be capable of flexing independently of one another, in order to
provide a high degree of local seal conformity against an irregular lumen or
tissue surface. In some embodiments, each cantilever element is associated

                                         4
with a respective aperture of a lattice structure of the stent. The cantilever
elements may, for example, have one end coupled (or integral) with the stent
body, and an opposite or remote end that is free to deploy outwardly. The
remote end may have a rounded or enlarged or pad tip to avoid having a
sharp end that might otherwise risk penetrating through the seal material.
The cantilever elements may extend generally in the same direction as each
other (e.g. having the remote end directed to one end (such as the outflow
end) of the stent-valve), or the cantilever elements may be arranged in two
opposite directions (e.g. at least one pointing towards the outflow end, and at
least another pointing towards the inflow end), or the cantilever elements may
be arranged in a variety of different directions.
In some embodiments, the seal support comprises a ring shape, or tubular
shape, or annular member. The member may have an annular coil shape.
In some embodiments, the seal support comprises a member that can be
stowed in a generally elongate or helical form, and which deploys to a radially
expanded loop form.
In some embodiments, the seal support comprises a portion of the stent that
everts from a stowed condition to a deployed condition. Eversion of the stent
can provide radial expansion upon deployment without increasing significantly
the diameter of the stent when compressed (de-everted).         For example, an
inflow end or portion of the stent may evert towards the outflow end.
In some embodiments, the stent carries a sealing skirt (or web).        The seal
support may bias biasing the skirt (or portions thereof) radially outwardly to
distend away from the body of the stent.
Additionally or alternatively to the above aspect of the provision of a seal
support, a seal of the stent-valve may be configured to be responsive to
direction of blood flow past the seal, relative to inflow and outflow ends of the
stent-valve. The seal may be configured such that blood flow in a reverse
direction (for outflow to inflow) biases the seal to a deployed state to obstruct
such flow.

                                          5
For example, the seal may comprise at least one web defining one or more
pockets. The one or more pockets may be configured to fill with blood in
response to blood flow in the reverse direction, such that the pocket distends
outwardly. Distention of the pocket can fill a gap between the stent-valve and
the surrounding anatomy, to obstruct the reverse flow of blood past the
pocket.
In some embodiments, the pocket may be defined or carried at a respective
aperture of a lattice structure of the stent. The pocket may be defined at least
partly by an outer skirt carried on an exterior of the stent. Additionally or
alternatively, the pocket may be defined at least partly by an inner skirt carried
on an interior of the stent.
Additionally or alternatively to the above aspects, a seal may comprise a skirt
at least a portion of which is captive with respect to the stent, and at least a
further portion of which is free to deploy or float relative to the stent.
In some embodiments, the further portion may contact a surrounding tissue or
lumen wall before the body of the stent is fully deployed. As part of the
deployment procedure, the stent may be displaced or biased in a first axial
direction to seat against native leaflets.     The frictional contact of the skirt
against the tissue may cause the further portion of the skirt to bunch or
wrinkle in the axial direction during the displacement action. Such bunching
or wrinkling may provide additional material to fill voids or gaps between the
stent and the surrounding tissue.
Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the further portion of the
skirt may be responsive to direction or paravalve blood flow or to pressure of
 blood acting on the skirt (for example, on the further portion of the skirt). The
further portion may, for example, deploy outwardly to contact a surrounding
tissue lumen wall. The further portion may form a flap, or generally channel or
annular pocket shape in response to, and/or that is responsive to, pressure of
blood or flow of blood in the reverse direction. The flap/channel/pocket shape
may bias an outer portion of the skirt to seat against the surrounding tissue or
lumen surface.

                                        6
Additionally or alternatively to the above aspects, a seal of the stent-valve
may be embossed to present a non-smooth surface.               For example, the
embossing may be defined by one or more sutures. The one or more sutures
may define a zig-zag pattern. The suture may define a generally continuous
embossment to obstruct blood flow therepast.
Additionally or alternatively to the above aspects, a seal of the stent-valve
may be generally oversized compared to the diameter of the stent. The seal
may be bunched or pleated by connections (e.g. suturing) to the stent that
causes bunching or pleating between the connections. The bunching/pleating
may create additional compliant bulk of seal material able to fill voids or gaps
between the stent-valve and the surrounding tissue or lumen surface.         The
poistions of the connections may define bunching or pleating in directions in a
pattern that obstructs leakage of blood therepast.
Additionally or alternatively to the above aspects, a seal of the stent-valve
may be configured to be self-expanding or self-filling due to a physical
property of the seal.
For example, in some embodiments, the seal may be of or comprise a
swellable material, foam, sponge or fibrous material.      Such a material may
self-expand resiliently when the stent deploys. Additionally or alternatively,
such a material may absorb blood (and/or a blood component) within its pores
or interstices in order to expand the material physically or add bulk.
In some embodiments, the seal may be generally flat and/or tubular in a
stowed state and/or may roll or curl into an annular bead or doughnut when in
a deployed state. The seal may be self-biased to the deployed state, but be
resiliently deformable to the stowed state during compression of the stent for
loading into a delivery apparatus. Upon removal of a constraining effect of a
sheath of the delivery apparatus, the seal may be configured to readopt the
deployed state, in order to provide a radially enlarged seal around the stent.
In some embodiments, at least a portion of the stent comprises a lattice
structure, and the stent-valve further comprises one or more seals deployable
from or through apertures of the lattice. In one form, the seals comprise web

                                          7
portions of material that define pockets associated with respective apertures
of the lattice. The web portions may be configured to distend outwardly from
the respective apertures.       For example, in some embodiments, the web
portions define pockets open on or to one side such that a respective pocket
fills with blood to distend outwardly from the aperture of the lattice.
Additionally or alternatively, the lattice structure of the stent may comprise
biasing elements for biasing the web portions (e.g. pockets) of material
radially outwardly from the lattice structure.
 In some embodiments, the stent carries a sealing skirt (or web). The stent
may comprise biasing elements for biasing the skirt (or portions thereof)
radially outwardly to distend away from the body of the stent. The sealing
skirt may optionally be carried on the exterior of the stent. An inner skirt (or
web) may optionally be carried on the interior of the stent (and optionally
coupled directly to the leaflets). At least one of the skirts may be of fabric
(e.g. PET). Additionally or alternatively, at least one of the skirts may be of
biological tissue, for example, pericardium.
 In some embodiments, a biasing element distinct from the stent may bias a
seal outwardly. For example, the biasing element may be a ring element (e.g.
closed ring or split ring), within an annular seal. The biasing element may be
compressible with the stent to a radially compressed condition. The biasing
element may expand (e.g. self-expand) towards a radially expanded state
when the stent is deployed. The biasing element may be of shape memory
material, e.g. nitinol.

                                            10
DETAILED DSCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
Referring to Fig. 1 (and Fig.            18), a stent-valve 10 is illustrated for
transcatheter implantation. The stent-valve 10 may be a cardiac stent-valve,
for example, an aortic stent-valve, a mitral stent-valve, a pulmonary stent
valve or a tricuspid stent-valve, for implantation at the respective valve
position in a human heart.
The stent-valve 10 may optionally comprise biological tissue (for example,
pericardium (such as porcine pericardium and/or bovine pericardium) and/or
natural cardiac valve leaflets (for example, natural porcine cardiac valve
leaflets, optionally attached to a portion of natural cardiac wall tissue). The
biological tissue may be fixed, for example, using glutaraldehyde.            The
biological tissue may have anti-calcification properties, for example, having
been treated or processed to inhibit or slow calcification (for example, by
treatment in alcohol or a process using detergent).
The stent-valve 10 may be compressible to a radially compressed condition
(not shown) for delivery using a delivery catheter, and be expandable to an
expanded condition (as shown) at implantation.           The stent-valve 10 may
comprise a stent 12 carrying a plurality of leaflets defining a valve 14. Various
geometries of stent 12 may be used. In some embodiments, the stent 12 may
include one of more of: a lower tubular or crown portion 16; an upper crown
portion 18; a plurality of upstanding commissural supports 20; and a plurality
of stabilization arches 22. In use, the lower portion 16 of the stent 12 may be
 configured to be deployed after the other regions of the stent 12 have first
been at least partly deployed. For example, the arches 22, the supports 20
and the upper crown 18 may be deployed at least partly before the lower
portion 16 (in that order, or in reverse order, or in a different order). At least
once the upper crown 18 has been at least partly deployed, the stent 12 may
be urged and/or displaced in the direction of arrow 24 to seat the upper crown
 18 against native leaflets at the implantation site. Deploying the lower portion
 16 last fixes the stent 12 in its final position.
 In some embodiments, at least the lower portion 16, and optionally a portion
of the upper crown 18, may be formed by a lattice structure of the stent. The

                                          11
lattice structure may define apertures, for example, generally diamond-shaped
apertures.
In some embodiments, the upper crown 18 may be regarded as (e.g., being or
comprising) a seal support, when a seal is attached to the upper crown 18.
The seal support defined by the upper crown may be considered to deploy the
seal at least somewhat outwardly relative to a portion or remainder of the
stent just below the upper crown.
The native leaflets may generally overlap a portion 26 of the stent. The native
valve annulus may overlap a portion 28 of the stent.
Optionally, the stent-valve 10 may further comprise an inner skirt 30
communicating with the leaflets 14 and carried on an interior of the stent 12.
Additionally or alternatively, the stent-valve 10 may further comprise an outer
skirt 32 carried on an exterior of the stent 12. When both skirts are provided,
the skirts may partially overlap. The skirts may be offset such that one skirt
(e.g. the outer skirt 32) extends further towards a lower extremity of the stent
 12 than the other (e.g. inner skirt 30). Additionally or alternatively, one skirt
(e.g. the inner skirt 30) extends further towards an upper extremity of the stent
 12 than the other (e.g. outer skirt 32).       The skirts may be of any suitable
flexible and/or compliant material, for example, fabric (e.g. of PET), or of
 plastics film (e.g of PET), or of biological tissue (e.g. of pericardium).
Optionally, at least the outer skirt 32 is positioned to leave (e.g. at least a
portion of) the upper crown 18 substantially unobscured by the outer skirt 32.
Such an arrangement may assist good blood flow to the coronary arteries (for
example, in the case of a stent-valve for the aortic valve).
 In some embodiments, the lower portion 16 has an extremity formed with a
substantially zig-zag shape. The zig-zag shape may comprise lower apexes
 16a and upper apexes 16b. The upper apexes 16b may be masked in Fig. 1
 by the superimposed presentation of both the frontmost and rearmost cells of
the lattice structure.    The zig-zag shape may be substantially continuous
around the circumference of the stent 12. The outer skirt 32 may have a
 peripheral edge having a zig-zag shape that matches substantially the zig-zag

                                       12
shape of the extremity of the lower portion 16.      Such an arrangement can
avoid excessive material at the extremity, and thereby facilitate crimping of
the stent-valve 10. At the same time, the outer skirt 32 covers (for example,
completely) open cells of the lattice structure down to the stent extremity to
reduce risk of blood leakage through the apertures of the cells. The outer
skirt 32 can also provide a layer of material over the struts of the stent,
thereby to cushion the engagement between the stent and the sensitive native
heart tissue.
The valve 14 may comprise biological tissue, for example, pericardium (such
as porcine pericardium or bovine pericardium) or natural cardiac valve leaflets
(for example, natural porcine cardiac valve leaflets, optionally attached to a
portion of natural cardiac wall tissue).     Other biological or non-biological
material could also be used for the valve 14, as desired.
The stent 12 may optionally be of a self-expanding type that is compressible
to the compressed state for loading into a delivery catheter having a sheath
for constraining the stent 12 in the compressed state for delivery to the site of
implantation. In use, by removal of the constraining effect of the sheath, the
stent 12 self-expands to or (e.g. at least partly) towards the expanded state.
A self-expanding stent may, for example, be of shape-memory material, for
example, shape-memory metal alloy, for example, nitinol.          Additionally or
alternatively, the stent 12 may be configured to be expanded by application of
an expanding force from the delivery catheter, such as by using an expansion
balloon.
There now follows a description of various seal configurations that may be
used with the above-described stent-valve 10. The seal configurations may
also be used with different stent shapes and configurations. Whether or not
described in detail, the following descriptions of seals may use any single or
 multiple combination of, aforementioned stent and/or stent-valve features.
Suitable materials for a seal may include biological tissue (for example,
 pericardium, such as porcine pericardium or bovine pericardium). Biological
tissue may be fixed tissue, for example, processed using glutaraldehyde.
 Pericardium is useful because of its very good flexibility, allowing the seal to

                                           13
conform to fit against and around the irregular shape of hard calcifications.
Additionally or alternatively, suitable material for a seal may include plastics
(for example, PET or PEEK).         Plastics may be used in woven or non-woven
fabric form, and/or in sheet form and/or film form, as desired. Plastics may
combine toughness with suitable flexibility and conformability. The plastics
may be of a biocompatible type.
Fig. 2 illustrates a first example of seal support in the form of a plurality of
cantilever elements 40 mounted on or integral with the stent 12.               Each
cantilever element 40 may be associated with a respective aperture 42 of the
 lattice structure.   Each cantilever element 40 may be bendable generally
independently of the others.        Each cantilever element 40 may be movable
between a stowed condition, in which the cantilever element is generally co
planar with the portion of the stent 12 around the aperture 42 (or at least is
compressed to lie directly or indirectly thereagainst), and a deployed condition
 in which the cantilever element 40 is biased radially outwardly from the body
 (e.g. lower portion 16) of the stent 12 (fig. 2b). The seal support urges a seal
 (e.g. the outer skirt 32) outwardly so as to fill gaps or voids between the stent
 valve 10 and the surrounding lumen/tissue.           The ability of the cantilever
elements 40 to flex independently can provide a high degree of local
conformity. Each cantilever element 40 may have a remote end 40a in the
 form of a rounded, or pad-like, or other non-damaging shape that can bear
 against the seal material to bias the seal radially outwardly, without
 penetrating through, or puncturing, the seal material. In the example shown,
 each cantilever element 40 may comprise a single strut.
 The cantilever elements 40 may be arranged generally in the same orientation
 (e.g. with the remote ends 40a directed towards one end, e.g. the outlet end,
 of the stent 12), or distributed to be orientated in two opposite directions, or be
 distributed to be orientated in a variety of different directions.
 The seal urged by the cantilever elements 40 may be generally continuous, or
 it may be discontinuous in the form of webs or pockets. The pockets may be
 arranged such that back-pressure of blood, or para-valvular blood flow in the
 reverse direction from outlet to inlet end of the stent 12, fills the pockets to

                                        14
cause the pockets further to distend, thereby enhancing the seal effect to
obstruct such para-valvular flow.      Further detail of such pockets is also
described with reference to Fig. 13, and any of such features may also be
used with the present example. The seal may optionally be attached to the
cantilever elements 40, or the seal may be unattached such that the cantilever
elements 40 interact with the seal by pushing outwardly.
Referring to Fig. 3, a seal support 46 is illustrated in the form of an annular
wire or ring that is oversize compared to the stent 10. The annular wire is
compressible to a stowed state when the stent is compressed, and expands
to a deployed state when unconstrained, to urge the seal 48 to a radially
expanded state to form a seal against the surrounding tissue/lumen.
Referring to Fig. 4, a seal support 50 is illustrated in the form of an elongate
member carrying a seal 52. The seal support is compressible to a stowed
form (Fig. 4a) for example a helical shape around the stent 12 when in its
compressed state. The seal support is expandable to a deployed state (Fig.
4b), for example, a radially expanded closed or semi-closed loop form in
which the seal support presents the seal 52 in expanded form around the
stent 12.
Referring to Fig. 5, a seal support 54 is illustrated in the form of an everting
portion of the lower region 16 of the stent 12. The seal support 54 is movable
between a stowed, non-everted configuration and a deployed, everted
configuration. In a compressed form constrained by a sheath 56 (Fig. 5a), the
lower portion of the stent including the seal support 54 is generally tubular
(non-everted). As the sheath 56 is progressively removed axially (Fig. 5b),
the seal support 56 is unsheathed. Unconstrained, the seal support 56 everts
to its deployed state in which the seal is presented and/or biased radially
outwardly from the stent body. Further unsheathing of the stent 12 or the
lower portion 16(Fig. 5c) permits the stent 12 to expand to its expanded state.
The everted seal support 54 urges the seal into tight sealing contact with the
surrounding tissue/lumen. The seal may be carried on the inners surface of
the stent when compressed, and presented in an outward direction when
everted.

                                           15
Fig. 6 illustrates a seal support that is similar to both Figs. 2 and 5. The seal
support 58 comprises flexible cantilever elements at the lower portion 16 of
the stent 12, similar to those of Fig. 2. The seal support 58 also resembles
the everted state of the seal support 56 of Fig. 5. In the example of Fig. 6, the
cantilever elements do not move between an everted and non-everted state.
 In the stowed state, the cantilever elements are generally flat against or within
the structure of the stent 12 (similar to Fig. 2).
Fig. 7 illustrates a seal in the form of a rollable bead or cuff 60. The rollable
cuff 60 may be self-biased or it may be supported by a seal support frame that
tends to roll the cuff 60. In a stowed state (Fig. 7b), the cuff is unrolled to
define a generally flat tubular form.        The cuff may be constrained in the
stowed state by a constraining sheath 62 of a delivery device.                 When
 unsheathed, the cuff 60 is free to move to its deployed state (Fig. 7a) in which
the cuff 60 rolls up to define a cuff or bead shape. Such a seal provides a
compliant bead of material to fill any gap between the stent 12 and the
surrounding tissue/lumen.
 Fig. 8 illustrates a seal 74 in the form of foam, or sponge or fibrous porous
material.     Such material is compressible when dry, because air is easily
expelled from the pores and/or interstices of material when compressed. The
 seal 74 may therefore adopt a compressed state without increasing the bulk
 of the stent-valve 10 significantly. Once implanted, blood may penetrate and
 fill the pores and/or interstices of the seal material. The blood may become
trapped in the pores and/or interstices, thereby creating a barrier to blood flow
through the material.        The blood may also cause distension of the seal
 material to further expand the seal outwardly and fill any gaps of voids around
the stent-valve 10.
 Fig. 9 illustrates a seal in the form of a flexible skirt 80. The skirt 80 depends,
for example, from the junction between the upper crown 18 and the lower
 portion 16 of the stent 16, to at least partly overlap the lower portion 16. A first
 (e.g. upper) portion 82 of the skirt 80 is coupled to the stent 12, to hold the
 skirt 80 captive. For example, the first portion 82 may be sutured to the stent

                                         16
12. A second (e.g. depending) portion 84 of the skirt 80 is generally
unconstrained, and is free to float relative to the stent 12.
As illustrated in Fig. 9b (and explained above in relation to Fig. 1), the
implantation procedure for the stent-valve 10 may involve displacing the stent
valve in the direction of arrow 24 to seat the upper crown 18 against native
valve leaflets. The friction between the floating second portion 84 of the skirt
80, and the surrounding tissue/lumen may cause the second portion 84 to
bunch or wrinkle axially, thus creating an excess of material that is able to
seal any gap between the stent-valve 10 and the surrounding tissue/lumen.
Fig. 10 illustrates an alternative seal in the form of a flexible skirt 90.      In
contrast to the skirt of Fig. 9, the skirt 90 projects from the upper crown 18
towards the upper end of the stent 12. As indicated in phantom, under back
pressure of blood, or reverse flow of blow around the stent-valve 10, the
flexible skirt bears outwardly to seal against the surrounding tissue/lumen.
The flexible skirt may form a channel shape section such that the back
pressure of blood increases the sealing pressure against the surrounding
tissue/lumen.
Fig. 11 illustrates an alternative seal in the form of an oversized flexible skirt
 100 that is connected to the stent 12 at one or more positions to define
pleating or bunching. The connections may be by suturing. The pleating or
bunching creates additional compliant material able to fill vids of gaps
between the stent 12 and the surrounding tissue/lumen.
 Fig. 12 illustrates an alternative seal in the form of a skirt that is folded to
define a cuff 102. The skirt material is flexible, but the fold creates a radiused
 bend providing a natural bulge. The bulge biases the seal material outwardly
 in order to fill voids or gaps between between the stent 12 and the
surrounding tissue/lumen.
 Fig. 13 illustrates an alternative seal comprising a plurality of flexible pockets
 110.    Each pocket may be associated with a respective aperture 112 of a
 lattice structure of the stent, for example, the lower portion 16 and/or the
 upper crown 18.       The pocket 110 may be defined by a flexible web of

                                          17
material. One wall of the pocket may be define by a portion of the outer skirt.
Another wall of the pocket may be defined by a portion of the inner skirt. The
pocket may be open on one side facing towards the outlet end of the stent,
and closed in the opposite direction.        In a stowed state, the pocket may
collapse or fold substantially flat so as not to increase the bulk of the stent
valve. Once deployed, the pocket may open either under the influence of
natural resilience, or under the influence of blood back pressure entering the
mouth of the pocket.       The back pressure causes the pocket to distend
outwardly against surrounding tissue/lumen, and thereby further obstructing
leakage of blood around the outside of the stent-valve 10.
Fig. 14 illustrates an alternative seal arrangement comprising material 120
that swells in response to contact with blood.       The swelling characteristics
increase the bulk of the seal, enabling the seal to distend to fill any gaps
between the stent-valve 10 and the surrounding tissue/lumen.            Example
swellable materials include a hydrogel and/or a liquid swellable polymer,
and/or a so called superabsorbent material. The material may, for example,
be carried by, or impregnated or otherwise embodied within the outer skirt.
For example, the skirt may be of fabric comprising fibres of the swellable
material.     The material may be captive within a containing chamber, for
example a flexible and/or distensible pouch or cuff. The combination of inner
and outer skirts, with one comprising swellable material, can provide an
especially effective seal arrangement. Further background information of use
of, for example, a hydrogel for stent-valves may be found in US 2005/137688.
The seal of Fig. 14 is also illustrated in other embodiments of Figs. 18 and 19.
The swellable material is denoted by numeral 44, the containing chamber 42,
together defining the paravalve seal 40 carried by, or comprised within, the
outer skirt 32.
Fig. 15 illustrates an alternative seal arrangement in which a sealant 122 is
dispensed from the delivery catheter 124 (or from a further delivery catheter
inserted after implantation), in order to seal around the periphery of the stent
valve 10. For example, the sealant is dispensed on the outflow side of the
stent-valve to seal any gaps between the upper crown and the native leaflets.

                                        18
Fig. 16 illustrates an alternative seal arrangement comprising material 124
that provides haemostatic and/or coagulant effects in response to contact with
blood. The material 124 may, for example, be carried by, or impregnated or
otherwise embodied within the outer skirt.          The material may be captive
within a containing chamber, for example a flexible and/or distensible pouch
or cuff. The combination of inner and outer skirts, with one comprising such
material, can provide an especially effective seal arrangement.
Fig. 17 illustrates an alternative seal arrangement comprising material 126
that elutes calcium locally.    The calcium may deposit directly or indirectly
against the surrounding tissue/lumen such that any gaps can be occluded.
The material 126 may, for example, be carried by, or impregnated or
otherwise embodied within the outer skirt.          The material may be captive
within a containing chamber, for example, a flexible and/or distensible pouch
or cuff. The combination of inner and outer skirts, with one comprising such
material, can provide an especially effective seal arrangement.
Figs. 20-23 illustrate an alternative seal in the form of a flexible skirt 150. The
skirt 150 may be the outer skirt 32 previously described. The skirt 150 may
be attached to the stent 12 and/or inner skirt 30 at least at one or more
attachment positions 152 spaced from an end 154 of the skirt 150 closest to
the outlet end 156 of the stent-valve 10.          The one or more attachment
positions 152 may be such as to define a first skirt portion 160 captive with
respect to the stent 12, and a second or further skirt portion 162 free to deploy
or float relative to the stent 12. The one or more attachment positions 152
may, for example, correspond to an inlet end 164 of the stent-valve 10 and/or
to an intermediate position between the extremities of the upper crown 18 and
the lower portion 16. At least one attachment position 152 may overlap, at
least partly, the inner skirt 30. Optionally, at least one attachment position
152 forms a direct attachment between the (e.g, outer) seal skirt 150 and the
inner skirt 30. Such attachment can obstruct leakage of blood between the
skirts 30 and 150.
As already explained with respect to Fig. 18, optionally, the lower portion 16
has an extremity formed with a substantially zig-zag shape.            The zig-zag

                                         19
shape may comprise lower apexes 16a and upper apexes 16b. The upper
apexes 16b may be masked in Fig. 20 by the superimposed presentation of
both the frontmost and rearmost cells of the lattice structure.        The zig-zag
shape may be substantially continuous around the circumference of the stent
12. The (e.g. outer) seal skirt 150 may have a peripheral edge having a zig
zag shape that matches substantially the zig-zag shape of the extremity of the
lower portion 16. Such an arrangement can avoid excessive material at the
extremity, and thereby facilitate crimping of the stent-valve 10. At the same
time, the (e.g. outer) seal skirt 150 covers (for example, completely) open
cells of the lattice structure down to the stent extremity to reduce risk of blood
leakage through the apertures of the cells. The (e.g. outer) seal skirt 150 can
also provide a layer of material over the struts of the stent, thereby to cushion
the engagement between the stent and the sensitive native heart tissue.
The second portion 162 of the skirt 150 may define a pocket or flap that is
able to distend outwardly under backpressure or backflow of blood. The flap
or pocket may extend continuously over an angle of at least about 180
degrees, optionally at least about 270 degrees, optionally about 360 (e.g.
correspond to entirely around the circumferential periphery).          The flap or
pocket may be substantially annular and/or channel shaped.
In use, when the stent-valve is in its implanted position, the second portion
162 of the skirt may distend against surrounding tissue, for example, under
backpressure of blood acting on the stent-valve 10 when the valve 14 has
closed, or para-valve leakage of blood backflowing around the stent-valve 10.
Distention of the second skirt portion 162 may define a pocket, such that the
backpressure of blood within the pocket effects a seal against the surrounding
tissue. In some aspects, the second skirt portion 162 may function similarly to
the skirt 90 of Fig. 10, but positioned closer to the inlet end of the stent than in
Fig. 10.
The skirt 150 may be dimensioned such that the end 154 closest to the outlet
may be positioned axially at a desired position. For example, in Fig. 20, the
end 154 may be positioned to be substantially at a waist of the stent 12
between the extremities of the upper crown 18 and the lower portion 16. In

                                        20
Fig. 21, the end 154 may be positioned part way up the upper crown 18 (e.g.
intermediate the waist and the extremity of the upper crown 18). In Fig. 22,
the end 154 may be positioned substantially in register with the extremity of
the upper crown 18. In Fig. 23, the end 154 may be positioned beyond the
extremity of the upper crown 18 (e.g. extending at least partly beyond the
upper crown 18 towards the outlet end of the stent-valve 10).
At least in the examples of Figs. 21-23, the upper crown 18 may act as a seal
support. When the upper crown 18 is deployed, the upper crown 18 may at
least partly bias the second skirt portion 162 outwardly, for example with
respect to the waist between the upper crown 18 and the lower portion 16.
Such biasing may urge the second skirt portion 162 (i) into engagement with
surrounding tissue and/or (ii) to a distended shape defining a flap or pocket
responsive to blood back-pressure and/or blood back-flow around the exterior
of the stent-valve 10. The upper crown 18 (and seal support) may comprise
cantilever elements. The cantilever elements may be flexible independently
of one another. Each cantilever element may have a U-shape or V-shape.
Each cantilever element may comprise a pair of struts that meet at the apex of
the cantilever element.
 In all examples, the end 154 may have a substantially straight edge, or it may
have a non-straight edge, for example, an undulating shape, or castellated
shape, or notched shape.          The variations in a non-straight edge may
optionally align with apexes of the upper crown 18. Providing a non-straight
edge may, in some embodiments, enable a reduction in the bulk of material of
the skirt 150 to be compressed for loading on to or in to a delivery apparatus,
which may be significant when the skirt 150 overlaps a region of the stent
valve 10 that is "crowded" in terms of stent material and/or leaflet material
and/or skirt material to be compressed.
In some embodiments, the second skirt portion 162 may be wholly unattached
to the stent 12.    Alternatively, in some embodiments, one or more control
attachments 166 may be formed between the second skirt portion 162 and the
stent 12 (for example, the upper crown 18). The control attachments 166 may
 be configured to permit the second skirt portion 162 to distend substantially

                                        21
freely, while preventing unwanted everting of the second skirt portion 162
(e.g. during compression and loading the stent-valve by an inexperienced
user).
Figs. 24-26 illustrate a further modification of the seal arrangement of Figs.
20-23. In Figs. 24-26, the end 154 of the seal is attached to the upper crown
18 at plural positions 168 around the circumferential edges of the end 154, to
define an annular pocket or annular channel shape of the second skirt portion
162. In use, the second skirt portion 162 may distend or billow outwardly from
the stent, as a distensible cuff, in response to backpressure and/or backflow
of blood.     The second skirt portion 162 may optionally have a clearance,
and/or an aperture and/or a notch between adjacent positions 170, to define a
communication port to allow blood to enter the annular pocket. For example,
the end 154 may have a castellated and/or notched and/or scalloped and/or
undulating edge to define such communication ports.
The upper crown 18 may act as a seal support. For example, the attachment
positions 168 may directly support the second skirt portion 162. Additionally
or alternatively, when the upper crown 18 is deployed, the upper crown 18
may at least partly bias the second skirt portion 162 outwardly, for example
with respect to the waist between the upper crown 18 and the lower portion
16. Such biasing may urge the second skirt portion 162 (i) into engagement
with surrounding tissue and/or (ii) to a distended shape defining a flap or
pocket responsive to blood back-pressure and/or blood back-flow around the
exterior of the stent-valve 10. The upper crown 18 (and seal support) may
comprise cantilever elements.        The cantilever elements may be flexible
independently of one another. Each cantilever element may have a U-shape
or V-shape. Each cantilever element may comprise a pair of struts that meet
at the apex of the cantilever element.
Attachment of the end 154 to the upper crown may provide additional control
over the otherwise free second skirt portion 162. Such an arrangement may
facilitate, for example, compressing and loading of the stent-valve 10 for
implantation, and avoid risk of the second skirt portion 162 being accidentally
everted.

                                         22
The attachment positions 168 between the end 154 of the skirt 150 and the
upper crown 18 may be chosen and/or varied as desired. In the embodiment
of Fig. 25, the attachment positions 168 may correspond to the extremity of
the upper crown 18. In Fig. 24, the attachment positions 168 may correspond
to an intermediate position partway up the upper crown 18 (for example,
intermediate the extremity of the upper crown 18, and the waist between the
upper crown 18 and lower portion 16).
Fig. 26 illustrates how the upper crown 18, and the skirt 150 of Fig. 25, may
be compressed to a stowed configuration when the stent-valve 10 is
compressed using a loading apparatus (for example, a crimper or a
compression funnel) for loading the stent-valve into or on to a delivery device
(for example a delivery catheter, not shown).        The upper crown 18 and the
second skirt portion 162 may lie substantially flat with the remainder of the
stent 12. Upon deployment, the upper crown 18 and the second skirt portion
162 may deploy radially outwardly (to the shape shown in Fig. 25).
The skirt 150 may have any desired profile shape. For example, in some
embodiments, the skirt 150 may have a substantially cylindrical shape. The
diameter of the cylindrical shape may correspond to the maximum diameter of
the lower portion 16 and/or to the diameter of the stent 12 (e.g. upper crown
 18) at the point reached by the end 154 of the skirt 150, and/or the maximum
diameter of the upper crown 18, and/or a dimension larger than the upper
crown. The waist defined between the upper crown 18 and the lower portion
 16, and/or the oversizing of a stent 12 with respect to the size of the native
 valve to be replaced (typically about 1, 2 or 3 mm diameter oversizing), may
 provide an excess of skirt material able to distend or billow outwardly for the
 sealing effect. Additionally or alternatively, the skirt 150 may be sculpted with
 a non-cylindrical shape, for example, a bulbous shape or a funnel shape, also
 to provide excess material able to distend or billow outwardly for the sealing
 effect.
As already described, the seals and/or skirts of any of the forgoing
 embodiments may be made of any suitable material. Suitable material may
 include biological tissue (for example, pericardium (for example, porcine

                                         23
pericardium or bovine pericardium).        Additionally or alternatively, suitable
material may include plastics (for example, PET or PEEK). Plastics may be
used in woven or non-woven fabric form, and/or in sheet form, and/or in film
form.
Although the seal arrangements have been described as alternatives, it is
envisaged that any two or more of the seal arrangements may be combined
for synergistic effect. It will also be appreciated that the foregoing description
is merely illustrative of example forms of the invention and that many
modifications and alternatives may be used within the scope of the invention.
