   Detailed Description of the Disclosure
15  [0027]     The following disclosure describes various embodiments of electronic devices,
   such as portable electronic devices including, for example, cellular telephones, and the
   like. Certain details are set forth in the following description and FIGS. to provide a
   thorough understanding of various embodiments of the present technology. Moreover,
   various features, structures, and/or characteristics of the present technology can be
20 combined in other suitable structures and environments. In other instances, well-known
   structures, materials, operations, and/or systems are not shown or described in detail in the
   following disclosure to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the various
   embodiments of the technology. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize,
   however, that the present technology can be practiced without one or more of the details
25 set forth herein, or with other structures, methods, components, and so forth.
    [0028]     The accompanying figures. depict several features of embodiments of the
   present technology and are not intended to be limiting of its scope. Many of the details,
   dimensions, angles, and other features shown in the Figures are merely illustrative of
   particular embodiments of the disclosure. Accordingly, other embodiments can have other
                                                   5

     WO 2013/181157                                                           PCT/US2013/042902
   details, dimensions, angles, and/or features without departing from the spirit or scope of
   the present disclosure.
    [0029]      An electronic device can include several components assembled together to
   form internal and/or external features of the electronic device. For example, one or more
 5 internal components (e.g., electrical circuitry and/or internal support structures) can be
   placed within external components (e.g., housing structures) to provide an electronic
   device having desired functionality. As used herein, the term "component" refers to a
   distinct entity of an electronic device. Components may include, for example, electronic
   circuit elements (e.g., a microchip), one or more members forming the housing of the
10 electronic device (e.g., a backplate or an outer periphery component), and internal support
   structures (e.g., a mid-plate).
    [0030]      In some cases, a component can be manufactured by assembling and
   connecting two or more different individual elements (i.e., "sections") together. As used
   herein, the term "section" can refer to an individual portion of a component, where that
15 component may be formed from multiple sections. The various sections of the component
   may then be coupled together using a "coupling member." For example, the electronic
   device may include an enclosure component assembled from two or more sections, which
   are joined together with one or more coupling members.
    [0031]      Based on the desired functionality and design of the component and its
20 sections, these coupling members can exhibit a wide range of shapes and structures. For
   example, the coupling members can include structural elements that can reinforce areas of
   high mechanical strain, counteract twisting movements at areas of high torsion, interlock
   two sections together such that they are mechanically coupled together, provide electrical
   isolation between two or more sections, and the like.
25  [0032]       FIG. 1 is a schematic perspective view of an electronic device 10. Electronic
   device 10 may be any one of a number of electronic devices including, but not limited to,
   cellular telephones, smartphones, other wireless communication devices, personal digital
   assistants, audio players, video players, game players, other media players, music
   recorders, video recorders, cameras, other media recorders, radios, medical devices,
30 vehicle transportation instruments, calculators, programmable remote controls, pagers,
   laptop computers, desktop computers, printers, and combinations thereof. In some cases,
                                                  6

     WO 2013/181157                                                             PCT/US2013/042902
   electronic device 10 may perform multiple functions (e.g. play music, display video, store
   pictures, and receive and transmit telephone calls).
    [0033]      In the illustrated embodiment, electronic device 10 includes a body 11
   incorporating a display 12. Display 12 can include a cover or cover glass 14 that is
 5 operably coupled to a frame, housing, or enclosure 16. In certain embodiments, display 12
   may allow a user to interact with or control electronic device 10. For example, display 12
   and/or cover glass 14 can include touch-sensitive features to receive input commands from
   a user. In various embodiments, a cover or cover glass can encompass most of the surface
   area (e.g., 50%-100%) of one side of electronic device 10 (as shown in FIG. 1), and a
10 cover or cover plates can be positioned on an opposing side of electronic device 10 (not
   shown). As described in detail below, enclosure 16 and the cover glass 14 can at least
   partially house or enclose several internal components of the electronic device. According
   to some embodiments, cover glass 14 may be made from a glass (e.g., a pigmented or non
   pigmented aluminosilicate glass) or other suitable material (e.g., sapphire).
15  [0034]      In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, enclosure 16 also at least partially
   defines several additional features of the electronic device 10. In particular, the
   enclosure 16 can include audible speaker outlets 18, a connector opening 20, an audio jack
   opening 22, a card opening 24 (e.g., SIM card opening), a front facing camera 26. Though
   not shown in FIG. 1, enclosure 16 may also include a rear facing camera, a power button,
20 and one or more volume buttons. Although FIG. 1 schematically illustrates several of
   these features, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the relative size and
   location of these features can vary.
    [0035]      In certain embodiments, enclosure 16 can be made from a metallic material.
   For example, enclosure 16 can be made from aluminum or an aluminum alloy such as
25 6063 Aluminum. In other embodiments, however, enclosure 16 can be made from other
   materials, including suitable metals, alloys, and/or plastics.
    [0036]      As shown in FIG. 1, enclosure 16 can include opposing edge portions 30
   (identified individually as a first edge portion 30a and a second edge portion 30b)
   extending around a periphery of the body 11. In certain embodiments, one or both of edge
30 portions 30 can have a chamfered, beveled, or other suitably shaped profile. As described
                                                    7

     WO 2013/181157                                                          PCT/US2013/042902
   in detail below, edge portions 30 may be formed to provide an aesthetically appealing
   appearance for enclosure 16.
    [0037]      According to some embodiments, the exterior surface of enclosure 16 can be
   exposed to a first treatment, edge portions 30 may be formed, and the exterior surface of
 5 enclosure 16, including edge portions 30, can be exposed to a second treatment. In one
   embodiment, for example, a first anodization process can be applied to enclosure 16
   before edge portions 30 are chamfered, and a second subsequent anodization process can
   be applied to enclosure 16 after edge portions 30 have been chamfered. Additional
   suitable surface treatments, including intermediary surface treatments, can be applied to
10 enclosure 16 and/or edge portions 30. In still further embodiments, edge portions 30 can
   have other suitable profiles or shapes including and/or surface treatments.
    [0038]      For example, the processes can include applying a mask to a portion of a metal
   surface (e.g., a portion of enclosure 16) using a photolithographic process. After the mask
   is applied, the metal surface can be exposed to one or more texturizing processes,
15 including machining, brushing, blasting, or chemically etching the surface.
    [0039]      Further, the metal surface can be exposed to an anodization process, which can
   convert a portion of the metal surface into a metal oxide for increased corrosion resistance,
   wear resistance, and or to obtain a desired cosmetic effect (e.g., colorization via absorption
   of dyes or metals). The anodization process may be performed before or after the
20 photolithographic mask is removed. In some embodiments, a first photolithographic mask
   can be removed and a second photolithographic mask can be applied before performing
   the anodization process. In still further embodiments, and as described above, the metal
   surface may be exposed to more than one anodization process. One or more finishing
   processes (e.g., polishing or sealing) may also be performed on the metal surface. In some
25 embodiments, a first portion of the housing may be exposed to a first anodization process
   and a second portion of the housing may be exposed to a second anodization process.
    [0040]      FIG. 2 is a schematic perspective view of a subassembly 40 of electronic
   device 10 of FIG. 1. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2, subassembly 40 includes
   enclosure 16 coupled to a cover glass, such as the cover glass 14 shown in FIG. 1. As
30 shown in FIG. 2, enclosure 16 can include a first enclosure section 42 coupled to a second
   enclosure section 44, which is in turn coupled to a third enclosure section 46.

   Additionally, enclosure 16 can include a first coupling member 48 that couples first
   enclosure section 42 to second enclosure section 44 at a first interface 43. Enclosure 16
   can also include a second coupling member 50 that couples second enclosure section 44 to
   third enclosure section 46 at a second interface 45. As assembled, subassembly 40 forms a
 5 five-sided structure, or tub, that can be enclosed on its sixth side by cover glass 14.
    [0041]      In certain embodiments, the first, second, and third enclosure sections 42, 44,
   and 46 can be metallic, and the first and second coupling members 48 and 50 can be made
   from one or more plastic materials. As described below in detail, for example, each of the
   first and second coupling members 48 and 50 can be formed from a two-shot molding
10 process that may include a first plastic portion that joins the corresponding enclosure
   portions and a second cosmetic plastic portion that at least partially covers the first plastic
   portions. As further described in detail below, these plastic portions can be configured to
   withstand harsh chemicals and manufacturing processes (e.g., the texturizing and
   anodization processes described above) that may be used to form and process the
15 enclosure. In further embodiments, the enclosure sections 42, 44, and 46 and/or the first
   and second coupling members 48 and 50 can be made from any suitable materials
   including metallic, plastic, and/or other materials.
    [0042]      According to additional features of the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2,
   enclosure 16 can include one or more low resistance conductive portions 52 (shown
20 schematically) for grounding purposes. Conductive portion 52 can be formed by
   removing one or more layers or portions of the enclosure 16 to provide a lower resistance
   through enclosure 16 for antenna transmissions or communications. In certain
   embodiments, for example, the conductive portion 52 can be formed by laser etching or
   otherwise removing or etching an anodized portion of enclosure 16. The exposed surfaces
25 of conductive portion 52 can then be chemically treated to retain its electrical
   conductivity. Examples of suitable chemical treatment include chromate and non
   chromate conversion coatings to passivate conductive portion 52. These coatings can be
   applied using techniques including spraying and brushing using a paint brush. The
   conductivity of conductive portion 52, as well as through different portions of
30 enclosure 16, can be tested using suitable techniques such as using resistance using probes
   at different points of conductive portion 52 and enclosure 16 to assure that ground can be
   established though enclosure 16.

    [0043]     The illustrated subassembly 40 also includes several inserts 54 that can provide
   increased structural support and functionality for enclosure 16. In embodiments in which
   the enclosure 16 is formed from aluminum, for example, inserts 54 can increase strength
   and durability of enclosure 16 by providing mounting points for structural and/or
 5 functional internal components. Additionally, in certain embodiments, inserts 54 can
   include threaded inserts or nuts that are configured to threadably engage a corresponding
   fastener. Inserts 54 formed from titanium may be advantageous as titanium can withstand
   harsh manufacturing processes and chemicals to which subassembly 40 may be subjected.
   In other embodiments, however, inserts 54 can be made from other suitable materials
10 including, for example, steel, stainless steel, or brass.
    [0044]     According to yet additional features of the subassembly 40 not visible in
   FIG. 2, but described in detail below with respect to FIGS 10, 11, and 15, cover plates can
   be securely coupled, and offset if desired, relative to one side of the five-sided
   enclosure 16. In particular, the cover plates can be aligned with a reference plane or
15 datum relative to enclosure 16. In order to maintain tight tolerance between the cover
   plates and enclosure sections 42, 44, and 46, enclosure 16 can include one or more access
   openings 56 that may be used to urge or bias the cover plates relative to the enclosure 16
   for secure attachment (e.g., an adhesive attachment). For example, one or more springs
   may be inserted through access openings 56 to bias the cover plates against a planar
20 structure until an applied adhesive sets.
    [0045]     FIG. 3 shows a top view of an of an outer periphery component 100 of an
   electronic device in accordance with some embodiments. In particular, FIG. 3 shows a
   view of outer periphery component 100, which may be assembled from sections 110, 120,
   and 130. Outer periphery component 100 may generally represent a more detailed view of
25 subassembly 40 of FIG. 2. For example, top section 110, center section 120, and bottom
   section 130 may correspond to first enclosure section 42, second enclosure section 44, and
   third enclosure section 46, respectively. Outer periphery component 100 can be
   constructed to form an exterior, peripheral surface for an electronic device. In particular,
   outer periphery component 100 can surround or enclose some or all of the internal
30 components (e.g., electronic circuits, internal support structures, and the like) of the
   electronic device. In other words, outer periphery component 100 can define an internal
   volume into which internal components can be placed.

     WO 2013/181157                                                           PCT/US2013/042902
    [0046]     The thickness, length, height, and cross-section of outer periphery
   component 100 may be selected based on any suitable criteria including, for example,
   structural requirements (e.g., stiffness or resistance to bending, compression, and tension
   or torsion in particular orientations). In some embodiments, outer periphery
 5 component 100 can serve as a structural member to which other electronic device
   components can be mounted. Some of the structural integrity of outer periphery
   component 100 can come from the closed shape that it defines (e.g., outer periphery
   component 100 forms a loop, thus providing structural integrity).
    [0047]     Outer periphery component 100 can have any suitably shaped cross-section.
10 For example, outer periphery component 100 can have a substantially rectangular cross
   section. Each corner of the substantially rectangular cross-section can be chamfered or
   rounded in shape, thus forming a "spline." As used herein, the term "spline" refers to a
   rounded corner portion of an outer periphery component. In some embodiments, outer
   periphery component 100 can have a cross-section in any other suitable shape including,
15 for example, a circular shape, an oval shape, a polygonal shape, or a curved shape. In
   some embodiments, the shape or size of the cross-section of outer periphery
   component 100 can vary along the length or width of the electronic device (e.g., an
   hourglass shaped cross-section). The spline may be formed by trimming one or more
   edges of outer periphery component 100 as described in detail below with respect to
20 FIG. 4.
    [0048]     Outer periphery component 100 of the electronic device can be constructed
   using any suitable process. In some embodiments, outer periphery component 100 can be
   constructed by connecting top section 110 and center section 120 together at interface 112,
   and connecting center section 120 and bottom section 130 together at interface 122.
25 Although outer periphery component 100 is illustrated in FIG. 3 as being constructed from
   three sections, one skilled in the art could appreciate that outer periphery component 100
   could alternatively be formed from any suitable number of two or more sections, and that
   the interfaces between the sections may be positioned at any location on outer periphery
   component 100.
30  [0049]     Each section 110, 120, and 130 can be constructed individually and later
   assembled to form outer periphery component 100. For example, each section can be
                                                   11

     WO 2013/181157                                                            PCT/US2013/042902
   individually constructed using one or more of stamping, machining, working, casting,
   extrusion, or any combinations of these. In some embodiments, the materials selected for
   sections 110, 120, and 130 can be conductive, thus allowing the sections to provide an
   electrical functionality for the electronic device. For example, sections 110, 120, and 130
 5 can be formed from a conductive material such as stainless steel or aluminum. In one
   particular embodiment, sections 110, 120, and 130 may be constructed from 6063
   Aluminum. In some embodiments, each section may serve as an antenna for the electronic
   device.
    [0050]      To mechanically couple individual sections together, coupling members 114
10 and 124 can exist at interfaces 112 and 122, respectively. In some embodiments, each of
   the coupling members can be constructed from a material that can begin in a first state and
   may subsequently change to a second state. As an illustration, the coupling members can
   be constructed from a plastic that begins in a first, liquid state and then subsequently
   changes to a second, solid state. For example, the coupling members may be formed using
15 one or more injection molding processes.
    [0051]      In some embodiments, the coupling member can be constructed from a glass
   filled polyethylene terephthalate ("PET"). Alternatively, the coupling member can be
   constructed from a high-strength plastic such as polyaryletherketone ("PAEK") or
   polyether ether ketone ("PEEK"). While in the liquid state, the plastic can be allowed to
20 flow into interfaces 112 and 122. After flowing into these interfaces, the plastic material
   may subsequently be allowed to harden into coupling members 114 and 124 (e.g., the
   plastic material is allowed to change into the second, solid state). Upon changing into the
   solid state, the plastic material may then physically bond top section 110 to center
   section 120 along a first edge of center section 120, and center section 120 and bottom
25 section 130 along a second edge of center section 120, thus forming a single new
   component (e.g., outer periphery component 100).
    [0052]      Coupling members 114 and 124 not only physically couple together
   sections 110 and 120, and sections 120 and 130; they may also electrically isolate top
   section 110 from center section 120, and center section 120 from bottom section 130. As
30 will be explained in more detail below, coupling members 114 and 124 may include
   locking structures that are attached to integrally formed parts of sections 110, 120,
                                                  12

     WO 2013/181157                                                          PCT/US2013/042902
   and 130. That is, when the coupling member is in its first state (e.g., the liquid state), it
   can flow into and/or around the locking structures of section 110, 120, and/or 130. A
   shutoff device (e.g., an insert mold, not shown) may be positioned at each interface to
   shape the coupling member for when it transforms into its second state (e.g., the solid
 5 state).
    [0053]     Coupling members 114 and 124 can be constructed to span a width of outer
   periphery component 100, as shown in FIG. 3. A portion of the coupling members 114
   and 124 can interface with locking members existing on the sidewalls of sections 110,
    120, and 130, and other portions of coupling members 114 and 124 can interface with
10 additional locking members existing on the edge of the sections. In some embodiments,
   the physical coupling between coupling members 114 and 124 and sections 110, 120,
   and 130 may be reinforced with one or more fasteners.
    [0054]     FIG. 4 shows a perspective view of the back side of outer periphery
   component 100 in accordance with some embodiments. Outer periphery component can
15 include top section 110, center section 120, bottom section 130, and interfaces 112
   and 122. As can be seen in FIG. 4, center section 120 can form three sides of the five
   sided outer periphery component 110, which can form a tub shape. The three sides of
   center section 120 can include a planar region 120a, a first sidewall 120s, and a second
   sidewall (not visible). The sidewalls may extend perpendicularly from planar region 120a.
20  [0055]     Top section 110 and bottom section 130 can each be U-shaped members that
   include outer surfaces 1 I0a and 130a, respectively. Top section 110 and bottom
   section 130 can also include inner surfaces (not shown). As assembled into outer
   periphery component 100, a plane co-planar with planar region 120a of section 120 can be
   perpendicular to any plane that is co-planar with outer surfaces 1 I0a and 130a of
25 sections 110 and 130.
    [0056]     Also visible in FIG. 4 are cover plates 170a and 170b, which will be discussed
   in more detail below with respect to FIGS. 10 and 11. Cover plates 170a and 170b may be
   coupled to outer periphery component 100 such that outer surfaces 171a and 171b are
   flush with an outer surface of at least one side of outer periphery component 100 (e.g., an
30 outer surface of center section 120). Cover plates 170a and 170b may each encompass
   any suitable surface area on the side of outer periphery component 100 (e.g., 1% to 50%).
                                                  13

     WO 2013/181157                                                          PCT/US2013/042902
    [0057]     Outer periphery component 100 can also include chamfered edges 11 6a
   and 116b. As noted above, chamfered edges can have any suitable shape (e.g., chamfer,
   round, or ogee), thus giving outer periphery component 100 any suitable cross-sectional
   shape. Chamfered edges 11 6a and 11 6b may be aesthetically and tactilely pleasing
 5 features for outer periphery component 100.
    [0058]     According to some embodiments, chamfered edges 1 16a and 1 16b may be
   formed after one or more molding processes that are used to create one or more coupling
   members 114 and 124. For example, top section 110 and center section 120 may be
   coupled together with coupling member 114 at interface 112. Excess material from the
10 molding of the coupling members that extends beyond the outer surface of outer periphery
   component 100 may be ground down, and outer periphery component 100 can be exposed
   to one or more finishing processes (e.g., anodization, texturization, or polishing).
    [0059]     One or more sections of the coupling members may then be machined to ready
   outer periphery component 100 for a second molding process, which can form cosmetic
15 outward facing components for the coupling members. Excess material from the second
   molding process may be removed (e.g., ground down), and then chamfered edges 116a
   and 1 16b can be machined, trimmed, ground, or otherwise processed to produce a desired
   edge profile (e.g., a chamfered edge profile). For example, the excess material from the
   second molding process may be removed in a co-finishing process such that the material is
20 flush with chamfered edges 1 16a and 1 16b, planar region 120a, first sidewall 120s (and
   the second sidewall, not visible), and outer surfaces 1 I0a and 130a of sections 110
   and 130, respectively. After chamfered edges 1 16a and 116b are formed, outer periphery
   component 100 may be exposed to one or more additional finishing processes (e.g., a
   second anodization process).
25  [0060]     FIG. 5 shows detailed cross-sectional view of a portion of outer periphery
   component 100 taken along line A-A' of FIG. 4. In particular, FIG. 5 shows a cross
   sectional view of of coupling member 114, top section 110, and a portion of center
   section 120 of outer periphery component 100. Coupling member 114 (and coupling
   member 124, which is not shown in this detailed view of outer periphery component 100)
30 can be constructed to include a first-shot component 1 14a and a second-shot
   component 114b.

    [0061]     Coupling members 114 and 124 (not shown) can be exposed to various
   physically and chemically harsh environments during the manufacturing process. For
   example, the side walls and back plate of an electronic device can undergo polishing or
   lapping operations, which can involve the use of very acidic (around pH 2) and/or very
 5 alkali (around pH 8-9) slurries depending on whether the polishing is a fine or rough
   polishing procedure. In addition, during a photolithography process, the device can be
   exposed to UV light during UV curing stage and developing stage, as well as exposure to a
   strong base such as sodium hydroxide for rinsing away non-cured photoresist material.
   Furthermore, during an anodizing process, the device can be subjected to a variety of
10 acidic and alkali solutions at elevated temperatures and for extended amounts of time, as
   described above with reference to anodizing techniques.      If a blasting, or other
   texturizing, procedure is used, the plastic material can be exposed to a pressurized blasting
   media. Additionally, during de-masking (used to remove photoresist material) the device
   can be exposed to acidic or alkali rinses solutions at elevated temperatures. Moreover,
15 during a CNC the device can be exposed to cutting fluids. The first shot and second shot
   materials can be unaffected by one or more of the above described processes in that they
   can maintain structural integrity and can appear substantially unmarred. It should be noted
   that in some embodiments a mask can be used to prevent degradation of portions of plastic
   during some of the processes described above. For example, a mask can be used to protect
20 plastic during higher intensity UV exposure during photolithography and during certain
   CNC steps to protect the plastic surface from scratching. Any suitable mask to protect the
   plastic can be used. In one embodiment, a UV curable polymer mask is used.
    [0062]     In embodiments described herein the materials used to form coupling
   members 114 and 124, can be configured to withstand some or all the above described
25 physical and chemical conditions. First-shot component 114a and second-shot
   component 114b can be made of different materials to serve different functions. In some
   embodiments, the first-shot component 1 14a can be formed from a relatively stronger
   material so as to provide structural support for the electronic device and second-shot
   component 114b can be formed from a softer but more cosmetically appealing material for
30 aesthetic purposes. In certain embodiments, both first-shot component 114a and second
   shot component 114b can be configured to withstand some or all of the above described
   physical and chemical conditions. For example, first-shot component 114a and second
                                                 15

     WO 2013/181157                                                            PCT/US2013/042902
   shot component 1 14b can be formed from a high mechanical strength thermoplastic
   polymer resin such as a glass-filled PAEK or PEEK material. In other embodiments a
   glass-filled PET material can be used. In preferred embodiments, second-shot
   component 114b can appear smooth and even, thereby providing a more cosmetically
 5 appealing appearance than first-shot component 114a. In some cases, the second-shot
   component 114b can take on any of a number of colors.
    [0063]      First-shot component 1 14a can be responsible for physically coupling together
   the sections (e.g., section 110 and section 120) of outer periphery component 100 and can
   be machined to include retaining regions for receiving the second shot. Second-shot
10 component 1 14b can function as a cosmetic component that is self-anchored within the
   retaining region of first-shot component 114a. Second-shot component 114b may be the
   only part of coupling member 114 that is visible to the user when the device is fully
   assembled. Because second-shot component 114b may be visible and exposed to the
   environment, including during one or more harsh processing steps, it can be formed from a
15 material suitable for maintaining an aesthetically pleasing appearance (e.g., polyether
   imide ("PEI")) notwithstanding such processing. Additionally, second-shot
   component 1 14b can have any suitable color.
    [0064]      According to some embodiments, first-shot component 114a can be injection
   molded between top section 110 and center section 120. In particular, top section 110 and
20 center section 120 can be inserted into an injection mold (not shown), and the material for
   forming first-shot component 114a can be injected into the mold cavity. In some
   embodiments, the injection mold may define one or more features and/or boundaries of
   first-shot component 114a, including one or more of elements 161-167 and/or coupling
   member edge 115. Alternatively, elements 161-167 and/or coupling member edge 115
25 can be formed (e.g., by grinding, machining, or otherwise trimming first-shot
   component 1 14a) after the material has cooled and set.
    [0065]      Coupling member 114 (and coupling member 124, not shown) may be
   machined, for example, to have holes, recesses, retention features, or any other desired
   features after it is applied as a first shot. Such machined features are illustratively shown
30 as elements 161-167. For example, elements 161-164 are holes, and elements 165-167 are
   rectangular cutouts. These machine features may enable cables to pass from one side of
                                                    16

   the coupling member to another or to enable secure placement of various components such
   as a button, a camera, a microphone, a speaker, an audio jack, a receiver, a connector
   assembly, or the like. Additionally, one or more of elements 161-164 can be an antenna
   window via which an antenna can radiate and/or receive signals.
 5  [0066]      FIG. 6 shows an exploded view of the detailed view of coupling member 114,
   top section 110, and center section 120 of outer periphery component 100 shown in
   FIG. 5. First-shot component 114a can include interface features 141-147 for interfacing
   with locking mechanisms 151-159 of sections 110 and 120. According to some
   embodiments, interface features 141-147 may be formed during a first-shot injection
10 molding process in which the material that forms first-shot component 1 14a fills the
   interstices that define locking mechanisms 151-159 of sections 110 and 120.
    [0067]      According to some embodiments, coupling member 114 can interface with
   sidewall locking mechanisms 151-154 and edge locking mechanisms 155-157 with
   sidewall interface features 141-144 and edge interface features 145-147, respectively. In
15 some embodiments, sidewall interface features 141-144 can be referred to as "knuckles."
   In particular, sidewall interface features 141 and 143 can form a first knuckle, and
   sidewall interface features 142 and 144 can form a second knuckle. Edge interface
   features, on the other hand can be formed on a "span" of coupling member 114, which
   extends between the two knuckles. When coupling member 114 is applied in a liquid state
20 (e.g., into an injection mold), it can flow into and/or around locking mechanisms 151-157.
   When the material sets and turns into a solid as coupling member 114, it can form a
   physical interconnect that couples sections 110 and 120 together. Coupling member 114
   can include fastener through-holes 148 and 149 that line up with holes and or inserts in
   section 110 such that screws or other fasteners can be used to secure coupling member 114
25 to section 110.
    [0068]      First-shot component 1 14a may also include second-shot cavities 140 for
   receiving second-shot components 114b. Second-shot cavities 140 may form recesses in
   first-shot component 1 14a at the interfaces between section 110 and section 120 (as well
   as section 120 and section 130, not shown). According to some embodiments, second
30 shot cavities 140 may be formed after first-shot component 114a has been formed. In
                                                   17

     WO 2013/181157                                                         PCT/US2013/042902
   particular, portions of first-shot component 1 14a can be removed (e.g., by sawing, drilling,
   or machining) to form the recesses for second-shot cavities 140.
    [0069]     Portions of sections 110 and 120 abutting first-shot component 114a may also
   be removed when forming second-shot cavities 140. For example, second-shot
 5 cavities 140 can be created by sawing material away from first-shot component 1 14a,
   section 110, and section 120 at the interfaces between sections 110 and 120. Accordingly,
   the width of second-shot cavities 140 can be repeated with accuracy, as the width is
   determined solely by the kerf of the saw. Accuracy and repeatability in the formation of
   second-shot cavities 140 may be advantageous for a number of reasons including, for
10 example, antenna performance and aesthetic considerations. In some embodiments, a
   relatively small amount (e.g., 0.05-0.15mm) of material may be removed from each of
   sections 110 and 120 during the formation of second-shot cavities 140.
    [0070]     Both second-shot cavities 140 may be formed at the same time. In particular,
   in embodiments in which second-shot cavities 140 are formed by sawing first-shot
15 component 1 14a, and/or portions of sections 110 and 120, second-shot cavities 140 can be
   cut together. Additionally, the same cut that forms second-shot cavities 140 can remove
   material from section 120 across the width of outer periphery component 100 between the
   second-shot cavities 140. Accordingly, a straight, clean edge can be formed at the edge of
   section 120, resulting in excellent alignment between the various components of outer
20 periphery component 100.
    [0071]     In further embodiments, second-shot cavities 140 may be formed as first-shot
   component 114a is molded (e.g., using features included in the injection mold). Second
   shot components 1 14b may be purely cosmetic and configured to withstand harsh
   processing and/or chemicals while maintaining an attractive outward aesthetic.
25  [0072]     In still further embodiments, coupling member 114 may include only first-shot
   component 1 14a, with second-shot component 1 14b being formed integrally with first
   shot component 114a. That is, coupling member 114 may be formed from a one-shot
   molding process, and the material that forms first-shot component 1 14a may be visible
   from the outside of outer periphery component 100. These embodiments may be

    [0073]     FIG. 7 shows a perspective view of extruded sections 710, 720, and 730 of an
   electronic device housing in accordance with some embodiments. Extruded sections 710,
 5 720, and 730 may be cut from extruded parts that are later machined to form sections 110,
    120, and 130, as discussed above. In some embodiments, extruded sections 710, 720,
   and 730 can be extruded separately in order to simplify the machining processes that will
   form sections 110, 120, and 130. Alternatively, two or more of extruded sections 710,
   720, and 730 may be cut from the same extruded part and cut to size (e.g., the relative
10 sizes shown in FIG. 7). For example, top extruded section 710 and bottom extruded
   section 730 may both be cut from the same extruded part. In some embodiments, one or
   more of extruded sections 710, 720, or 730 may be bent during or after extrusion.
    [0074]     According to some embodiments, extruded sections 710, 720, and 730 may be
   assembled such that the longitudinal extrusion axis (i.e., the axis along which the section
15 was extruded) of at least one of the sections (e.g., top extruded section 710 and bottom
   extruded section 730) is perpendicular to the longitudinal extrusion axis of at least one
   other section (e.g., center extruded section 720). For example, the longitudinal extrusion
   axes of top extruded section 710 and bottom extruded section 730 may be parallel to the z
   axis, while the longitudinal extrusion axis of center extruded section 720 may be parallel
20 to the y-axis. One or more of extruded sections 710, 720, and 730 may be oriented
   differently in order to facilitate machining of extruded sections 710, 720, and 730 into, for
   example, sections 110, 120, and 130. For example, it may be difficult or impossible to
   form the five-sided tub structure of outer periphery component 100 of from a single
   extruded part or multiple extruded parts oriented along the same longitudinal extrusion
25 axis.
    [0075]     One consequence of orienting one or more sections along different longitudinal
   extrusion axes is that visible grains, which are typical byproducts of extrusion processes,
   may not match between adjacent sections of the assembled electronic device.
   Accordingly, the materials and extrusion parameters used to form extruded sections 710,
30 720, and 730, as well as the final orientations of the sections, may be optimized to
   minimize the appearance of grain boundaries between adjacent sections. As just one

   example, extruded sections 710, 720, and 730 may be formed from a material that is not
   susceptible to forming visual stretch marks during the extrusion process (e.g., 6063
   Aluminum). Accordingly, extruded sections 710, 720, and 730 may appear to have a
   smooth, continuous, unibody aesthetic after the extruded sections are machined and
 5 assembled. In particular, the five-sided outer periphery component 100, which can be
   assembled from sections 110, 120, and 130, may appear to be one continuous, unibody
   component.
    [0076]     Assembling an electronic device housing from separate extruded sections (e.g.,
   extruded sections 710, 720, and 730) can be advantageous in several respects. For
10 example, forming sections of an electronic device housing from extruded parts can be a
   cost effective and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional methods (e.g., die
   casting or molding) as the extrusion process can create long lengths of extruded parts that
   cut to appropriate lengths without excessive waste. Additionally, the availability of
   separately extruded sections can allow for the formation of detailed locking features (e.g.,
15 edge locking mechanisms 155-157 and sidewall locking mechanisms 151-154 of FIG. 6
   and retention holes 860 of FIG. 8), which may not be possible if the housing is formed
   from a single molded part.
    [0077]     FIG. 8 shows a perspective view of a portion of outer periphery component 100
   of an electronic device including one or more retention holes 860 formed therethrough in
20 accordance with some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 8, one or more of section 120,
   coupling member 114, and section 110 may include one or more retention holes 860
   formed therethrough (or partially therethrough). For example, retention holes 860 may be
   machined or otherwise formed through the material of center section 120 between a top
   surface 120t and a bottom surface 120b (not shown) of section 120. Alternatively,
25 retention holes 860 may extend only partially into the section 120 without reaching or
   extending through bottom surface 120b.
    [0078]     In some embodiments, section 120 can be made from aluminum or an
   aluminum alloy (e.g., 6063 Aluminum), which may not be suitable for forming threads for
   receiving a screw. Therefore, the interior surface 860i of retention holes 860 may be
30 substantially continuous and smooth, and thus may not be suitable for receiving and
   retaining a screw mechanism. A threaded insert 870 may be positioned within and
                                                20

   retained by retention hole 860 such that a screw mechanism may be threadably retained
   within a portion of outer periphery component 100.
    [0079]     As shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B, a threaded insert 870 may be positioned within
   retention hole 860. Threaded insert 870 can include one or more elements for receiving a
 5 fastener. For example, threaded insert 870 can include threads 872 for receiving and
   retaining a screw 880. Threaded insert 870 may be made of any material (e.g., titanium)
   suitable for receiving and gripping screw 880 and withstanding harsh chemicals and/or
   processes (e.g., texturization and/or anodization).
    [0080]     Titanium may be particularly suitable for threaded insert 870, because while
10 titanium can anodize under the conditions used for anodizing aluminum, it will anodize
   only minimally and create little film growth. Thus, the titanium inserts will remain
   conductive and therefore suitable for electrical grounding, for example, even after
   undergoing an aluminum anodizing process. In addition, since anodization will occur
   minimally on titanium, the geometry of any threaded regions of the inserts may remain
15 substantially the same. It should be noted that in addition to titanium, other suitable hard
   metals materials can be used for the threaded insert 870, including magnesium, zinc,
   tantalum, or hard aluminum alloys such as 7075 Aluminum. Inserts made of softer
   aluminum alloys can be used, however the softer aluminum inserts may anodize in the
   aluminum anodizing bath. Therefore, in order to keep the aluminum inserts electrically
20 conductive and to retain any threaded geometry, it can be necessary to mask the aluminum
   inserts using, for example polymer plugs, prior to exposure to the anodizing bath.
   However, this masking process can add time, cost, and manual labor to the process.
    [0081]     Threaded insert 870 may include a cap 874 that may be coupled to a body 875.
   In some embodiments, cap 874 and body 875 can be integrally formed. The external
25 surfaces of threaded insert 870 may be sized and shaped similarly to the size and shape of
   the internal surfaces of retention hole 860 such that threaded insert 870 can be positioned
   within retention hole 860. For example, threaded insert 870 may be press fit into retention
   hole 860 (e.g., in the direction of arrow D). In some embodiments, an adhesive may be
   used to retain threaded insert 870 within retention hole 860.
30  [0082]     In some embodiments, at least a portion of cap 874 may have a larger cross
   sectional area than a portion of body 875. A top portion 862 of retention hole 860 may be

   larger than the remainder of retention hole 860, such that top portion 862 may receive
   cap 874 and prevent cap 874 from being passed through the remainder of retention
   hole 860. Moreover, cap 874 may include one or more protrusions 873 that may be
   received by one or more complimentary notches 863 in top portion 862 of retention
 5 hole 860. When each protrusion 873 of cap 874 is aligned with and positioned within a
   respective notch 863 in top portion 862 of retention hole 860, the interaction of each
   protrusion 873 and notch 863 may prevent threaded insert 870 from rotating with respect
   to retention hole 860 (e.g., in the direction of arrow S).
    [0083]      Threaded insert 870 may also include a threaded hollow 876 that may extend
10 through at least a portion of cap 874 and/or through at least a portion of body 875. The
   interior surface of threaded hollow 876 may include one or more threads 872 that may
   receive and retain complimentary threads 882 of a screw 880 that is rotated down into
   threaded hollow 876 (e.g., in the direction of arrow S). As mentioned, due to the
   interaction of each protrusion 873 and notch 863, threaded insert 870 may be prevented
15 from rotating within retention hole 860 in the direction of arrow S while screw 880 may be
   rotated within threaded hollow 876 of threaded insert 870 in the direction of arrow S. By
   positioning threaded insert 870 within retention hole 860 (e.g., of section 120) screw 880
   may be screwed into and at least partially retained by threaded insert 870 within retention
   hole 860 such that screw 880 can couple section 120 (via threaded insert 870) to another
20 component of the electronic device assembly (not shown).
    [0084]      FIG. 10 shows a perspective view of outer periphery component 100 including
   cover plates 170a and 170b. After coupling members 114 and 124 have coupled top
   section 110 to center section 120 and center section 120 to bottom section 130,
   respectively, cover plates 170a and 170b may be coupled to a bottom side of coupling
25 members 114 and 124, respectively. Cover plates 170a and 170b may be formed from any
   suitable material or combination of materials (e.g., pigmented glass, white ceramic glass,
   or sapphire) that may protect one or more components positioned within outer periphery
   component 100. The material that forms cover plates 170a and 170b may be chosen for
   having a number of desirable qualities, including high strength, stiffness, and hardness or
30 scratch resistance, transparency to radio frequencies, and/or opaqueness to visible light.
   The material also may be chosen based on aesthetic considerations (e.g., whether the color

   of the cover plate coordinates well with other colors of the electronic device incorporating
   outer periphery component 100 that are visible to a user).
    [0085]      According to some embodiments, cover plates 170a and 170b may be formed
   from a pigmented glass (e.g., pigmented aluminosilicate glass). The pigmented glass may
 5 be opaque to visible light in order to hide one or more internal components housed within
   outer periphery component 100 including, for example, coupling members 114 and 124.
   In these embodiments, the pigmented glass can be treated with one or more processes to
   improve its hardness and stiffness. For example, the pigmented glass can be exposed to a
   potassium nitrate bath, which can initiate an ion exchange process that strengthens the
10 glass.
    [0086]      Additionally, one or both sides of cover plates 170a and 170b (e.g., outer
   surfaces 171a and 171b and/or their respective opposing sides) formed from pigmented
   glass may be painted. Painting one or both sides of cover plates 170a and 170b with a
   dark paint can ensure that the cover plates are, indeed, opaque and add consistency
15 between cover plates manufactured in different batches, lots, plants, etc. Cover
   plates 170a and 170b may be formed from pigmented glass in order to match dark colored
   features included elsewhere in outer periphery component 100 and/or the finished
   electronic device (e.g., electronic device 10 of FIG. 1).
    [0087]      According to some further embodiments, cover plates 170a and 170b may be
20 formed from a ceramic glass material. A base glass for forming the ceramic glass may be
   a glass (e.g., aluminosilicate glass) with several nucleation sites disposed throughout. The
   nucleation sites may be formed from any suitable impurity introduced into the base glass.
   The base glass can then be transformed into ceramic glass by exposure to one or more
   temperature cycling processes (e.g., raising and lowering the temperature of the base
25 glass), which can promote crystal formation around the nucleation sites, thus forming the
   ceramic glass. In some embodiments, the ceramic glass may be an opaque, light colored
   (e.g., white, off white, or light gray) material. In these embodiments, the ceramic glass
   can be treated with one or more processes to improve its hardness and stiffness. For
   example, the ceramic glass can be exposed to a sodium nitrate bath, which can initiate an
30 ion exchange process that strengthens the glass.

      WO 2013/181157                                                         PCT/US2013/042902
    [0088]      As with the pigmented glass, one or both sides of cover plates 170a and 170b
   formed from ceramic glass may be painted. Painting one or both sides of cover
   plates 170a and 170b with a light (e.g., white, off white, or gray) paint can ensure that the
   cover plates are opaque and add consistency between cover plates manufactured in
 5 different batches, lots, plants, etc. Cover plates 170a and 170b may be formed from
   ceramic glass in order to match light colored features included elsewhere in outer
   periphery component 100 and/or the finished electronic device (e.g., electronic device 10
   of FIG. 1).
    [0089]      According to still further embodiments, although they may be opaque to visible
10 light frequencies (e.g., 390-750 THz), cover plates 170a and 170b may be transparent to
   light at frequencies (e.g., 500-6500 MHz) used for wireless communication. Accordingly,
   cover plates 170a and 170b may be used as antenna windows that allow antennas disposed
   proximate thereto to radiate and receive wireless signals.
    [0090]      According to some embodiments, cover plates 170a and 170b can be sliced to
15 the appropriate thickness and cut to the appropriate lateral dimensions for incorporation
   into outer periphery component 100. Cover plates 170a and 170b may also be exposed to
   one or more polishing steps (e.g., before and/or after the sodium or potassium nitrate
   strengthening baths).
    [0091]      Furthermore, it may be aesthetically and tactilely advantageous for outer
20 surfaces 171a and 171b of cover plates 170a and 170b to be flush with outer surface 121
   of section 120. Accordingly, to ensure that outer periphery component 100 has a smooth
   and continuous outer surface, one or more springs or biasing mechanisms may be provided
   through coupling members 114 and 124 for supporting cover plates 170a and 170b with
   respect to coupling members 114 and 124 while an adhesive is allowed to set. The
25 adhesive can adhere cover plates 170a and 170b to coupling members 114 and 124, for
   example.
    [0092]      As shown in FIG. 11, one or more springs or biasing mechanisms 1104 (e.g.,
    1 104a-c) may be passed through holes 125 in coupling member 124 towards the underside
   of cover plate 170b to bias cover plate 170b against a flat datum surface 1100. Outer
30 surface 121 of section 120 may also be held against flat datum surface 1100. According to
   some embodiments, each biasing mechanism may be independently controlled by its own
                                                  24

   biasing module 1102 (e.g., 1 102a-c) such that different portions of cover plate 170b may

   portions of outer surface 171b of cover plate 170b may be flush or in a continuous plane
   with outer surface 121 of section 120 while an adhesive (not shown) is allowed to dry.

   and/or section 130.
    [0093]     FIG. 12 shows an illustrative process 1200 for creating a housing for an
   electronic device in accordance with some embodiments. Beginning at step 1201, three
   separate sections of a housing can be formed. The three separate sections can include a
10 top section, a center section, and a bottom section. According to some embodiments, the
   three separate sections may be extruded along a longitudinal extrusion axis and cut to the
   appropriate length (e.g., the lengths of extruded sections 710, 720, and 730 of FIG. 7).
   The three separate sections may be formed from a metallic material (e.g., aluminum,
   6063 Aluminum, stainless steel, or any other suitable metal or alloy). One skilled in the
15 art will appreciate that the housing for the electronic device may be assembled from any
   suitable number of sections (e.g., 2-5).
    [0094]     At step 1203, each extruded section can be machined to include locking
   members and/or other suitable features. The locking members can be formed along one or
   more edges (e.g., edge locking mechanisms 155-157 of FIG. 6) and/or sidewalls (e.g.,
20 sidewall locking mechanisms 151-154 of FIG. 5) of each section. According to some
   embodiments, each extruded section may also be machined to reduce the thickness of the
   walls of the extruded sections. The walls of each extruded section may be machined to a
   thickness that will optimize the interior volume of the electronic device assembled from
   the sections while retaining suitable structural integrity.
25  [0095]     At step 1205, a first section is coupled to a second section with a first coupling
   member. Similarly, at step 1207, the second section can be coupled to a third section with
   a second coupling member. For example, as shown in FIG. 3, top section 110 can be
   coupled to center section 120 with coupling member 114, and center section 120 can be
   coupled to bottom section 130 with coupling member 124. According to some
30 embodiments, the coupling members can be formed at the same time (e.g., during a first
   shot injection molding process). Accordingly, the three separate sections can be set within
                                                  25

     WO 2013/181157                                                            PCT/US2013/042902
   a mold, and the injection molding material (e.g., a suitable liquid plastic material such as
   PAEK or PEEK) can be injected into the mold. The injection molding material may be
   permitted to flow into one or more of the locking members of the sections and allowed to
   set, physically coupling the sections together. As an alternative, each of the coupling
 5 members can be formed separately.
    [0096]     At step 1209, the first and second coupling members can be machined to form
   cosmetic cavities. Because the first and second coupling members may be responsible for
   adding structural support to the electronic device housing, the material that forms the
   coupling members may be chosen primarily for its strength. Accordingly, aesthetic
10 considerations may be a secondary concern for the coupling members. However, as part
   of the coupling members may be visible on the exterior of the electronic device (e.g., at
   interfaces 112 and 122 of FIG. 4), the portions of the coupling members that will be
   visible can be machined to create cosmetic cavities, (e.g., cavities suitable for receiving
   second-shot molded members). The second-shot material may be chosen primarily for its
15 aesthetic qualities.
    [0097]     At step 1211, cosmetic structures can be formed in the cosmetic cavities.
   According to some embodiments, the cosmetic structures may be formed in the cosmetic
   cavities using a second-shot injection molding process. As the cosmetic structures may be
   visible from the exterior of the electronic device, a suitable material (e.g., PEI) may be
20 chosen for its ability to maintain a pleasing aesthetic appearance even after exposure to
   one or more harsh chemicals (e.g., sulfuric acid and nitric acid) and/or processes (e.g., UV
   light exposure and anodization). After the cosmetic structures are formed, one or more
   grinding or sanding processes may shape the cosmetic structures such that they are flush
   with the outer surfaces of the housing.
25  [0098]     At step 1213, first and second cover plates (e.g., cover plates 170a and 170b of
   FIG. 10) can be fixed to the first and second coupling members, respectively. The first
   and second cover plates may be affixed to the first and second coupling members such that
   outer surfaces of the cover plates are co-planer with at least one outer surface of one of the
   sections (e.g., outer surface 121 of section 120). Alternatively, the cover plates may be
30 offset by a desired distance from the datum surface defined by an outer surface of one of
   the sections.

    [0099]      According to some embodiments, one or more edges of the housing may be
   machined, trimmed, or otherwise altered to form an aesthetically and tactilely pleasing
   profile. For example, opposing edge portions 30 of FIG. 1 can be machined to create
   chamfered edges. According to some embodiments, the edges can be machined after the
 5 cosmetic structures are formed at step 1211. For instance, after the cosmetic structures are
   molded and shaped as described above, the edges of the housing (and portions of the
   cosmetic structures) can be machined to form a desired edge profile (e.g., a chamfered
   edge profile). After the edges are machined, the housing may be exposed to one or more
   finishing processes (e.g., anodization). Accordingly, both the material that forms the
10 housing (e.g., 6063 Aluminum) and the material that forms the cosmetic structures (e.g.,
   PEI) may be chosen to withstand, and maintain a pleasing external appearance, through
   the finishing processes.
    [00100]     FIG. 13 shows an illustrative process 1300 for creating a housing for an
   electronic device in accordance with some embodiments. Beginning at step 1301, three
15 separate sections of a housing can be formed. The three separate sections can include a
   top section, a center section, and a bottom section. According to some embodiments, the
   three separate sections may be extruded along a longitudinal extrusion axis and cut to the
   appropriate length (e.g., the lengths of extruded sections 710, 720, and 730 of FIG. 7).
   The three separate sections may be formed from a metallic material (e.g., aluminum,
20 6063 Aluminum, stainless steel, or any other suitable metal or alloy). One skilled in the
   art will appreciate that the housing for the electronic device may be assembled from any
   suitable number of sections (e.g., 2-5).
    [00101]     At step 1303, at least one section can be machined to include retention holes
   (e.g., retention holes 860 of FIG. 8). The retention holes may extend from a top surface of
25 a section through a bottom surface (e.g., top surface 120t and bottom surface 120b of
   section 120 of FIG. 9A). Alternatively, the retention holes may extend through the top
   surface of the section without reaching the bottom surface.
    [00102]     At step 1305, a first section can coupled to a second section with a first
   coupling member. Similarly, at step 1307, the second section can be coupled to a third
30 section with a second coupling member. For example, steps 1305 and 1307 may
                                                   27

     WO 2013/181157                                                           PCT/US2013/042902
   substantially correspond to steps 1205 and 1207 as described above with respect to
   FIG. 12.
    [00103]     At step 1309, the first and second coupling members can be machined to form
   holes corresponding to the retention holes of the at least one section. In particular, holes
 5 can be formed in the first and second coupling members at points where the coupling
   members overlap retention holes that were formed at step 1303. In some embodiments,
   step 1303 may be omitted, and retention holes can be formed in at least on section and
   through the coupling members simultaneously (e.g., in step 1309). According to certain
   embodiments, a top section of the retention holes may be larger than the remainder of the
10 retention holes. Furthermore, one or more notches may be formed in the top sections of
   the retention holes.
    [00104]     At step 1311, threaded inserts (e.g., threaded insert 870 of FIG. 9A) may be
   placed into the retention holes. The threaded inserts may have outer dimensions that
   correspond to the dimensions of the retention holes. For example, if the retention holes
15 include top sections with wider cross-sectional areas than the remainder of the retention
   holes, the threaded inserts may have include a cap (e.g., cap 874 of FIG. 9A) with a cross
   sectional area corresponding to the top sections of the retention holes and a body (e.g.,
   body 875 of FIG. 9A) with a cross-sectional area corresponding to the remainder of the
   retention holes. According to some embodiments, the cap of the threaded insert can
20 include one or more protrusions (e.g., protrusions 873 of FIG. 9A) that correspond to
   notches in the top sections of the retention holes.
    [00105]     The threaded inserts may include a threaded hollow (e.g., threaded hollow 876)
   that may extend through at least a portion of the cap and/or through at least a portion of
   the body. The interior surface of the threaded hollow may include one or more threads
25 (e.g., threads 872 of FIG. 9A) that may receive and retain complimentary threads of a
   screw (e.g., threads 882 of screw 880 of FIG. 9B) that can be rotated down into the
   threaded hollow. In some embodiments the threaded inserts may be formed from a metal
   (e.g., titanium). According to some embodiments, the threaded inserts may be press fit
   into the retention holes and/or affixed within the retention holes using an adhesive.
30  [00106]     At step 1313, fasteners (e.g., screws) may be retained within the threaded
   inserts. The fasteners may be used to mount or otherwise couple one or more internal
                                                   28

     WO 2013/181157                                                         PCT/US2013/042902
   components of the electronic device to the sections of the housing. For example, one or
   more circuit boards, structural reinforcing members, cameras, and/or other suitable
   internal components may be mounted within the electronic device housing assembled from
   the sections.
 5  [00107]     FIG. 14 shows an illustrative process 1400 for creating a housing for an
   electronic device in accordance with some embodiments. At step 1401, at least one
   section of the housing can be extruded. According to some embodiments, a single
   member can be extruded along a longitudinal extrusion axis cut to lengths appropriate for
   the sections of the housing of the electronic device. For example, extruded sections 710,
10 720, and 730 of FIG. 7 may be cut from a single extruded member. In other embodiments,
   any of the sections of the housing can be extruded separately. For example, extruded
   sections 710, 720, and 730 can each extruded separately and cut to length or extruded
   sections 710 and 730 may be cut from the same extruded member and center extruded
   section 720 may be extruded separately.
15  [00108]     The sections may be formed from any suitable material (e.g., aluminum,
   6063 Aluminum, stainless steel, or plastic). According to some embodiments, however,
   the material and various extrusion parameters (e.g., extrusion rate, temperature, etc.) may
   be chosen to minimize the appearance of any stretch marks or grains resulting from the
   extrusion process. For example, 6063 Aluminum may be chosen for the material.
20 Accordingly, when the sections are joined together, the housing can appear to be of a
   seamless, unibody construction without noticeable grain boundaries between the sections.
    [00109]     At step 1403, each extruded part can be machined to the desired dimensions of
   the housing. For example, the extruded parts can be machined to form sections 110, 120,
   and 130 of FIG. 3. In particular, the thickness of the each extruded part can be machined
25 to a thickness that can optimize the interior volume of the electronic device housing
   assembled from the sections while retaining suitable structural integrity. Other features
   may also be formed in the extruded parts at step 1403, including one or more retention
   holes (e.g., retention holes 860 of FIG. 8) and/or locking members (e.g., locking
   members 151-157 of FIG. 6).
30  [00110]     According to some embodiments, steps 1401 and 1403 may be combined. In
   particular, a single member can be extruded along a longitudinal extrusion axis and
                                                  29

     WO 2013/181157                                                            PCT/US2013/042902
   machined to form the desired dimensions of the housing. For example, a single member in
   the shape of a rectangular prism may be extruded and then material can be removed (e.g.,
   by machining) to form the housing. The housing can be a five-walled, tub shaped housing
   with a rectangular, planar surface and four sidewalls extending perpendicularly from the
 5 rectangular, planar surface as depicted schematically in FIG. 2, for example. In some
   embodiments, the single member can be cut into individual sections (e.g., sections 710,
   720, and 730) before or after machining. Furthermore, additional material may be
   removed from one or more of the sections to form a window in the rectangular, planar
   surface.
10  [00111]     At step 1405, the sections can be rotated such that the longitudinal extrusion
   axis of at least one of the sections is oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal extrusion
   axis of at least one other section. For example, the longitudinal extrusion axes of two of
   the sections (e.g., top section 110 and bottom section 130) may be oriented perpendicular
   to the longitudinal extrusion axis of a third section (e.g., center section 120 of FIG. 3).
15  [00112]     At step 1407, the sections can be physically coupled together using one or
   more coupling members to create the housing of the electronic device. This step may be
   substantially similar to those described in steps 1205 and 1207 of FIG. 12.
    [00113]     FIG. 15 shows an illustrative process 1500 for creating a housing for an
   electronic device in accordance with some embodiments. At step 1501, cover plates can
20 be coupled to coupling members accessible via a back side of an electronic device
   housing. For example, cover plates 170a and 170b can be coupled to coupling
   members 114 and 124, respectively, of outer periphery component 100 of FIG. 10.
   According to some embodiments, the cover plates can be coupled to the electronic device
   housing with an adhesive (e.g., an epoxy).
25  [00114]     At step 1503, the electronic device housing can be placed against a planar
   datum surface. For example, to ensure that the outer surfaces of the cover plates are flush
   with an outer surface of the electronic device housing (e.g., outer surfaces of 171a
   and 171b of cover plates 170a and 170b are flush with outer surface 121 of section 120 of
   FIG. 10), the outer surfaces can be placed against a planar datum surface (e.g., flat datum
30 surface 1100 of FIG. 11). The planar datum surface can be any flat surface external to the
   electronic device.
                                                   30

     WO 2013/181157                                                           PCT/US2013/042902
    [00115]     At step 1505, the electronic device housing, including the cover plates, can be
   biased against the planar datum surface with one or more biasing mechanisms. For
   example, the electronic device can be biased against the planar datum surface with any
   suitable external force (e.g., a biasing mechanism such as a spring or gravity).
 5 Additionally, the cover plates can be biased against the planar datum surface with one or
   more biasing mechanisms (e.g., springs). The biasing mechanisms(e.g., biasing
   mechanisms 1104a-c) may be passed through holes (e.g., holes 125 in coupling
   member 124) towards the underside of the cover plates to the cover plates against the flat
   datum surface 1100. According to some embodiments, each biasing mechanism can be
10 separately controlled by a biasing module (e.g., biasing modules 1 102a-c) such that
   different portions of the cover plates may be biased with different biasing forces against
   the flat datum surface to ensure that the outer surfaces of the cover plates and the outer
   surface of the electronic device are flush. At step 1507, the adhesive may be allowed to
   dry while the electronic device housing is biased against the planar datum surface.
15  [00116]     It should be understood that the processes described above are merely
   illustrative. Any of the steps may be removed, modified, or combined, and any additional
   steps may be added or steps may be performed in different orders, without departing from
   the scope of the invention.
    [00117]     The described embodiments of the invention are presented for the purpose of
20 illustration and not of limitation.
