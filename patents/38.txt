                                        Field of the Invention
           A menu of mutations was developed that is useful in fine-tuning the attenuation and
15 growth characteristics of dengue virus vaccines.
                                    Background of the Invention
           Dengue virus is a positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus genus of the
   family Flaviviridae. Dengue virus is widely distributed throughout the tropical and
   semitropical regions of the world and is transmitted to humans by mosquito vectors.
20 Dengue virus is a leading cause of hospitalization and death in children in at least eight
   tropical Asian countries (WHO, 1997. Dengue haemorrhagicfever: diagnosis, treatment
   prevention and control - 2nd ed. Geneva: WHO). There are four serotypes of dengue virus
   (DEN-I, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4) which annually cause an estimated 50 - 100 million
   cases of dengue fever and 500,000 cases of the more severe form of dengue virus infection,
25 dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) (Gubler, D.J. & Meltzer,
   M. 1999 Adv Virus Res 53:35-70). DHF/DSS is seen predominately in children and adults
   experiencing a second dengue virus infection with a serotype different than that of their
   first dengue virus infection and in primary infection of infants who still have circulating
   dengue-specific maternal antibody (Burke, D.S. et al. 1988 Am J Trop Med Hyg 38:172-80;
30 Halstead, S.B. et al. 1969 Am J Trop Med Hyg 18:997-1021; Them, S. et al. 1997 Am J
   Trop Med Hyg 56:566-72). A vaccine is needed to lessen the disease burden caused by
   dengue virus, but none is licensed. Because of the association of more severe disease with
   secondary dengue virus infection, a successful vaccine must induce immunity to all four
   serotypes. Immunity is primarily mediated by neutralizing antibody directed against the
35 envelope E glycoprotein, a virion structural protein. Infection with one serotype induces
   long-lived homotypic immunity and a short-lived heterotypic immunity (Sabin, A. 1955
   Amer J Trop Med Hyg 4:198-207). Therefore, the goal of immunization is to induce a long
   lived neutralizing antibody response against DEN-I, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4,
                                                 -1A-

   which can best be achieved economically using live attenuated virus vaccines. This is a
   reasonable goal since a live attenuated vaccine has already been developed for the related
   yellow fever virus, another mosquito-borne flavivirus present in tropical and semitropical
   regions of the world (Monath, T.P. & Heinz, F.X. 1996 in: Fields B.N. et al. eds. Fields
 5 Virology Philadelphia: Lippincott-Ravan Publishers, 961-1034).
           Several live attenuated dengue vaccine candidates have been developed and
   evaluated in humans or non-human primates. The first live attenuated dengue vaccine
   candidates were host range mutants developed by serial passage of wild type dengue
   viruses in the brains of mice and selection of mutants attenuated for humans (Kimura, R. &
10 Hotta, S. 1944 Japanese J Bacteriology 1:96-99; Sabin, A.B. & Schlesinger, R.W. 1945
   Science 101:640; Wisseman, C.L. Jr. et al. 1963 Am J Trop Med 12:620-623). Although
   these candidate vaccine viruses were immunogenic in humans, their poor growth in cell
   culture discouraged further development. Additional live attenuated DEN-I, DEN-2, DEN
   3, and DEN-4 vaccine candidates have been developed by serial passage in tissue culture
15 (Angsubhakom, S. et al. 1994 Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health 25:554-9;
   Bancroft, W.H. et al. 1981 Infect Immun 31:698-703; Bhamarapravati, N. et al. 1987 Bull
   World Health Organ 65:189-95; Eckels, K.H. et al. 1984 Am J Trap Med Hyg 33:684-9;
   Hoke, C.H. Jr. et al. 1990 Am J Trop Med Hyg 43:219-26; Kanesa-thasan, N. et al. 2001
   Vaccine 19:3179-88) or by chemical mutagenesis (McKee, K.T. Jr. et al. 1987 Am J Trap
20 Med Hyg 36:435-42). It has proven very difficult to achieve a satisfactory balance between
   attenuation and immunogenicity for each of the four serotypes of dengue virus using these
   approaches and to formulate a tetravalent vaccine that is safe and satisfactorily
   immunogenic against each of the four dengue viruses (Kanesa-thasan, N. et al. 2001
   Vaccine 19:3179-88; Bhamarapravati, N. & Sutee, Y. 2000 Vaccine 18 Suppl 2: 44-7).
25         Two major advances utilizing recombinant DNA technology have recently made it
   possible to develop additional promising live attenuated dengue virus vaccine candidates.
   First, methods have been developed to recover infectious dengue virus from cells
   transfected with RNA transcripts derived from a full-length cDNA clone of the dengue
   virus genome, thus making it possible to derive infectious viruses bearing attenuating
30 mutations which have been introduced into the cDNA clone by site-directed mutagenesis
   (Lai, C.J. et al. 1991 PNAS USA 88:5139-43). Second, it is possible to produce antigenic
   chimeric viruses in which the structural protein coding region of the full-length cDNA
   clone of dengue virus is replaced by that of a different dengue virus serotype or from a
   more divergent flavivirus (Bray, M. & Lai, C.J. 1991 PNAS USA 88: 10342-6; Chen, W. et
35 al. 1995 J Virol 69:5186-90; Huang, C.Y. et al. 2000 J Virol 74:3020-8; Pletnev, A.G. &
                                                -IB-

   Men, R. 1998 PNAS USA 95:1746-5 1). These techniques have been used to construct
   intertypic chimeric dengue viruses which have been shown to be effective in protecting
   monkeys against homologous dengue virus challenge (Bray, M. et al. 1996 J. Virol
   70:4162-6). Despite these advances, there is a need to develop attenuated antigenic dengue
 5 virus vaccines that specify a satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity
   for humans.
                                      Summary of the Invention

   are useful in fine tuning the attenuation and growth characteristics of dengue virus
   vaccines.

15                                Brief Description of the Drawings
           Figure 1 shows growth of wt DEN4 2A and vaccine candidate, 2AA30, in Vero and
   HuH-7 cells. Vero (A) or HuH0-7 (B) cells were infected with DEN4 2A or 2AA30 at a
   multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 or 0.01. Confluent cell monolayers in 25-mm tissue
   culture flasks ere washed and overlaid with a 1.5 ml inoculum containing the indicated
20 virus. After a two hour incubation at 370 C, cells were washed three times in PBS and 7 ml
   of culture media supplemented with 2% FBS was added. A 1 ml aliquot of tissue culture
   medium was removed, replaced with fresh medium, and designated the 0 hour time-point.
   At the indicated time points post-infection, samples of tissue culture media were removed
   and frozen at -70 0C. The level of viral replication was assayed by plaque titration in Vero
25 cells. Briefly, serial ten-fold dilutions of cell culture media samples were inoculated onto
   confluent Vero cell monolayers in 24-well plates in duplicate and overlaid with Opti-MEM
   containing 0.8% methylcellulose. After five days, plaques were visualized by
   immunoperoxidase staining as described in Example 1.
           Figure 2 shows generation of temperature-sensitive (ts) DEN4 viruses by 5
30 fluorouracil (5-FU) chemical mutagenesis. The wild-type DEN4 2A virus was derived
   from a cDNA clone of DEN4 strain 814669 (Dominica, 1981). Vero cells were infected
   with DEN4 2A and overlaid with culture media containing 1 mM 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
   which resulted in a reduction of approximately 100-fold in viral replication when compared
   to untreated controls. Viral progeny from the 1 mM 5-FU-treated cultures were subjected
                                                    -3-

   to a single round of terminal dilutions generating 1,248 biologically cloned viruses which
   were screened for ts phenotypes by assessing virus replication at 35"C and 39"C in Vero
   and HuH-7 cells. Virus clones which demonstrated a 100-fold or greater reduction in titer
   at 39*C were terminally diluted an additional two times and amplified in Vero cells.
 5 Temperature-sensitive phenotypes of the 3x biologically cloned viruses were confirmed by
   evaluating efficiency of plaque formation (EOP) in the indicated cells as described in
   Example 1.
             Figure 3 shows plaque size phenotypes of representative 5-FU mutant DEN4
   viruses. Serial ten-fold dilutions of wild-type DEN4 2A-13 (A), 5-FU mutant. viruses #569
10 and #1189 (B), and 5-FU mutant viruses #1083 and #311 (C) were inoculated onto
   confluent Vero and HuH-7 cell monolayers in 24-well plates. After incubation at 35'C for
   two hours, monolayers were overlaid with 0.8% methylcellulose culture media. Following
   incubation at 35'C for five days, plaques were visualized by immunoperoxidase staining.
   Viruses which had a plaque size that was <1 mm (approximately <50% the size of wt
15 DEN4 2A-13) at the permissive temperature of 35*C were designated as having the small
   plaque (sp) phenotype. Mutant viruses #569 and #1189 (B) were sp in both Vero and HuH
    7 cells, and #311 and #1083 (C) were sp in only HuH-7 cells.
             Figure 4 shows generation of recombinant DEN4 viruses. (A), The p4 cDNA clone
   is represented which was constructed from the 2A cDNA clone (derived from DEN4
20  814669) by site-directed mutagenesis.        Restriction enzyme sites were introduced or
   removed to facilitate subsequent cloning of DEN4 recombinants bearing introduced
    attenuating mutations.    Restriction enzyme sites are shown and define fragments of the
    genome that were sub-cloned into modified pUC- 119 vectors for site-directed mutagenesis
   to introduce mutations identified in the 5-FU mutant viruses.       (B), An outline of the
25 methods used to generate rDEN4 viruses is also represented and described in Example 1.
             Figure 5 shows amino acid sequence of the rDEN4 NS5 gene (SEQ ID NO: 1).
    Eighty underlined amino acid pairs were mutagenized to alanine pairs; 32 pairs in boldface
   represent mutant viruses that could be recovered in either Vero or C6/36 cells; pairs in
    normal type represent mutant viruses that could not be recovered in either Vero or C6/36
30  cells.     Boxed    regions  indicate   putative   functional domains,  including   an  S
    adenosylmethionine utilizing methyltransferase domain (SAM), an importin-p binding
                                                  -4-

   domain adjacent to a nuclear localization sequence (importin-p - binding + NLS) and an
   RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (Polymerase).
            Figure 6 shows plaque size of mutant 5-lAl in C6/36 cells. Note that 5-lA1 has a
   small plaque phenotype in C6/36 cells relative to that of the wild type virus.
 5          Figure 7 shows growth of wild type rDEN4 and 5-lAl in C6/36 cells. Cells were
   inoculated in triplicate with each virus at an MOI of 0.01, and the amount of virus present
   in the supernatants that were harvested on the indicated days was determined by plaque
   enumeration in Vero cells. The titers are expressed as log1 PFU/ml ± standard error.
            Figure 8 shows nucleotide alignment of the 3' UTR of mosquito-borne and tick
10 borne flaviviruses. cDNA sequences are shown 5' to 3' and represent a portion of the UTR
   corresponding to DEN4 nucleotides 10417 to 10649 (3' genome end).               Nucleotide
   numbering represents the position in the alignment.        Regions deleted or swapped are
   indicated using the nucleotide numbering of DEN4.           GenBank accession numbers for

   indicated.
             Figure 10 shows plaque size phenotypes of rDEN4 viruses encoding Vero
25 adaptation mutations. Serial three-fold dilutions of the indicated viruses were inoculated
   onto confluent Vero and C6/36 cell monolayers in 6-well plates. After incubation at 37"C
    (Vero) or 32'C (C6/36) for two hours, monolayers were overlaid with 0.8% methylcellulose
   culture media.       Following incubation for five days, plaques were visualized by
    immunoperoxidase staining. Values below each well are the average plaque size in mm ±
30  standard error. For each of the virus-infected wells, 36 plaques were measured on the
    digital image of the 6-well plate on Adobe Photoshop at 300% view.

            Figure 11 shows growth curve in Vero cells of rDEN4 viruses encoding single
   Vero adaptation mutations. Vero cells were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI
   of 0.01.    Confluent cell monolayers in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks were washed and
   overlaid with a 1.5 ml inoculum containing the indicated virus. After a two hour incubation
 5 at 37 C, cells were washed three times in PBS and 5 ml of culture medium supplemented
   with 2% FBS was added. A 1 ml aliquot of tissue culture medium was removed, replaced
   with fresh medium, and designated the 0 hour time-point. At the indicated time points
   post-infection, samples of tissue culture medium were removed, clarified, and frozen at
   70*C. The level of virus replication was assayed by plaque titration in Vero cells. Briefly,
10 serial ten-fold dilutions of cell culture media samples were inoculated onto confluent Vero
   cell monolayers in 24-well plates in duplicate and overlaid with Opti-MEM containing
   0.8% methylcellulose.      After five days, plaques were visualized by immunoperoxidase
   staining as described in Example 1. Limit of detection (L.O.D.) is > 0.7 logjOPFU/ml.
            Figure 12 shows growth curve in Vero cells of rDEN4 viruses encoding combined
15 Vero cell adaptation mutations. Vero cells were infected with the indicated viruses at an
   MOI of 0.01. Confluent cell monolayers in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks were washed and
   overlaid with a 1.5 ml inoculum containing the indicated virus. After a two hour incubation
   at 37'C, cells were washed three times in PBS and 5 ml of culture medium supplemented
   with 2% FBS was added. A 1 ml aliquot of tissue culture medium was removed, replaced
20 with fresh medium, and designated the 0 hour time-point. At the indicated time points
   post-infection, samples of tissue culture medium were removed, clarified, and frozen at
   70'C. The level of virus replication was assayed by plaque titration in Vero cells. Limit of

                        Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment
           To assemble a collection of useful mutations for incorporation in recombinant live
   dengue virus vaccines, site-directed and random mutagenesis techniques were used to
15 introduce mutations into the dengue virus genome.         The resulting mutant viruses were
   screened for several valuable phenotypes, including temperature sensitivity in Vero cells or
   human liver cells, host cell restriction in mosquito cells or human liver cells, host-cell
   adaptation for improved replication in Vero cells, and attenuation in mice.      The genetic
   basis for each observed phenotype was determined by direct sequence analysis of the virus
20 genome. Mutations identified through these sequencing efforts have been further evaluated
   by their re-introduction, singly, or in combination, into recombinant dengue virus and
   characterization of the resulting phenotypes.     In this manner, a menu of mutations was
   developed that is useful in fine-tuning the attenuation and growth characteristics of dengue
   virus vaccines.

      Chemical Mutagenesis of Dengue Virus Type 4 Yields Temperature-Sensitive and
                                   Attenuated Mutant Viruses
           A recombinant live attenuated dengue virus type 4 (DEN4) vaccine candidate,
   2AA30, was found previously to be generally well-tolerated in humans, but a rash and an
30 elevation of liver enzymes in the serum occurred in some vaccinees.          2AA30, a non
   temperature-sensitive (ts) virus, contains a 30 nucleotide deletion in the 3' untranslated
   region (UTR) of the viral genome. In the present study, chemical mutagenesis of DEN4
                                                 -9-

    has been utilized to generate attenuating mutations which may be useful to further attenuate
    the incompletely attenuated 2AA30 candidate vaccine.         Wild-type DEN4 2A virus was
    grown in Vero cells in the presence of 5-fluorouracil, and, from a panel of 1,248 clones that
    were isolated in Vero cells, twenty ts mutant viruses were identified which were ts in both
 5  Vero and HuH-7 cells (n = 13) or in HuH-7 cells only (n = 7).          Each of the twenty ts
    mutations possessed an attenuation (att) phenotype as indicated by restricted replication in
    the brains of seven day old mice. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 20 ts mutant
    viruses identified nucleotide substitutions in structural and non-structural genes as well as
    in the 5' and 3' UTR with more than one change occurring, in general, per mutant virus. A
10  ts mutation in the NS3 protein (nucleotide position 4,995) was introduced into a
    recombinant DEN4 virus possessing the A30 deletion creating the rDEN4A30-4995
    recombinant virus which was found to be ts and to be more attenuated than rDEN4A30 in
    the brains of mice. A menu of attenuating mutations is being assembled that should be
    useful in generating satisfactorily attenuated recombinant dengue vaccine viruses and in
15  increasing our understanding of the pathogenesis of dengue virus.
            The mosquito-borne dengue (DEN) viruses (serotypes 1 to 4) are members of the
    Flavivirus genus     and contain a single-stranded positive-sense         RNA genome of
    approximately 10,600 nucleotides (nt) (Monath, T.P. & Heinz, F.X. 1996 in: Fields
     Virology B.N. Fields, et al. Eds. pp. 961-1034 Lippincott-Ravan Publishers, Philadelphia).
20  The genome organization of DEN viruses is 5'-UTR-C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3
    NS4A-NS4B-NS5-UTR-3'         (UTR - untranslated region, C - capsid, PrM - pre-membrane,
    E - envelope, NS - non-structural) (Chang, G.-J. 1997 in: Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic
   fever D.J. Gubler & G. Kuno, eds. pp. 175-198 CAB International, New York; Rice, C.M.
     1996 in: Fields Virology B.N. Fields et al. Eds. pp. 931-959 Lippincott-Raven Publishers,
25  Philadelphia).   A single viral polypeptide is co-translationally processed by viral and
    cellular proteases generating three structural proteins (C, M, and E) and seven NS proteins.
    The disease burden associated with DEN virus infection has increased over the past several
    decades in tropical and semitropical countries. Annually, there are an estimated 50-100
    million cases of dengue fever (DF) and 500,000 cases of the more severe and potentially
30  lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever / dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) (Gubler, D.J. &
    Meltzer, M. 1999 Adv Virus Res 53:35-70).
                                                  -10-

           The site of viral replication in DEN virus-infected humans and the pathogenesis of
   DF and DHF/DSS are still incompletely understood (Innis, B.L. 1995 in: Exotic viral
   infections J.S. Porterfield, ed. pp. 103-146 Chapman and Hall, London). In humans, DEN
   virus infects lymphocytes (Kurane, I. et al. 1990 Arch Virol 110:91-101; Theofilopoulos,
 5 A.N. et al. 1976 Jmmunol 117:953-61), macrophages (Halstead, S.B. et al. 1977 JExp
   Med 146:218-29; Scott, R.M. et al. 1980 J Infect Dis 141:1-6), dendritic cells (Libraty,
   D.H. et al. 2001 J Virol 75:3501-8; Wu, S.J. et al. 2000 Nat Med 6:816-20), and
   hepatocytes (Lin, Y.L. et al. 2000 JMed Virol 60:425-31; Marianneau, P. et al. 1996 J Gen
   Virol 77:2547-54).     The liver is clearly involved in DEN virus infection of humans, as
10 indicated by the occurrence of transient elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase
   (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in the majority of dengue virus-infected
   patients and by the presence of hepatomegaly in some patients (Kalayanarooj, S. et al. 1997
   JInfect Dis 176:313-21; Kuo, C.H. et al. 1992 Am J Trop Med Hyg 47:265-70; Mohan, B.
   et al. 2000 J Trop Pediatr 46:40-3; Wahid, S.F. et al. 2000 Southeast Asian J Trop Med
15 Public Health 31:259-63). DEN virus antigen-positive hepatocytes are seen surrounding
   areas of necrosis in the liver of fatal cases (Couvelard, A. et al. 1999 Hum Pathol30:1106
   10; Huerre, M.R. et al. 2001 Virchows Arch 438:107-15), and dengue virus sequences were
   identified in such cases using RT-PCR (Rosen, L. et al. 1999 Am J Trop Med Hyg 61:720
   4). Of potential importance to the etiology of severe dengue virus infection, three studies
20 have demonstrated that the mean levels of serum ALT/AST were significantly increased in
   patients with DHF/DSS versus those with DF (Kalayanarooj, S. et al. 1997 J Infect Dis
   176:313-21; Mohan, B. et al. 2000 J Trop Pediatr 46:40-3; Wahid, S.F. et al. 2000
   Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health 31:259-63).
           A vaccine for DEN viruses is not presently licensed. Since previous infection with
25 one dengue virus serotype can increase the risk for DHF/DSS following infection with a
   different serotype (Burke, D.S. et al. 1988 Am J Trop Med Hyg 38:172-80; Halstead, S.B.
   et al. 1969 Am J Trop Med Hyg 18:997-1021; Thein, S. et al. 1997 Am J Trop Med Hyg
   56:566-72), it is clear that a dengue virus vaccine will need to protect against each of the
   four dengue virus serotypes, namely DENI, DEN2, DEN3, and DEN4. Several strategies
30 are currently being actively pursued in the development of a live attenuated tetravalent
   DEN virus vaccine (Bancroft, W.H. et al. 1984 JInfect Dis 149:1005-10; Bhamarapravati,
   N. & Sutee, Y. 2000 Vaccine 18:44-7; Guirakhoo, F. et al. 2000 J Virol 74:5477-85;
                                                  -11-

   Huang, C.Y. et al. 2000 J Virol 74:3020-8).         Recently, we demonstrated that a live
   attenuated DEN4 vaccine candidate, 2AA30, was attenuated and immunogenic in a group
   of 20 human volunteers (see Example 8). This recombinant DEN4 virus contains a 30 nt
   deletion in the 3' UTR which removes nucleotides 10,478-10,507 and was restricted in
 5 replication in rhesus monkeys. Levels of viremia in humans were low or undetectable, and
   virus recovered from the vaccinees retained the A30 mutation. An asymptomatic rash was
   reported in 50% of patients.        The only laboratory abnormality observed was an
   asymptomatic, transient rise in the serum ALT level in 5 of 20 vaccinees. All vaccinees
   developed serum-neutralizing      antibody against DEN4 . virus        (mean titer:   1:580).
10 Importantly, 2AA30 was not transmitted to mosquitoes fed on vaccinees and has restricted
   growth properties in mosquitoes (Troyer, J.M. et al. 2001 Am J Trop Med Hyg 65:414-9).
   The presence of a rash and of the elevated ALT levels suggests that the 2AA30 vaccine
   candidate is slightly under-attenuated in humans. Because of the overall set of desirable
   properties conferred by the A30 mutation, chimeric vaccine candidates are being
15 constructed which contain the structural genes of dengue virus type 1, 2, and 3 and the
   DEN4 attenuated backbone bearing the genetically stable A30 mutation.
           Although the initial findings indicate the utility of the 2AA30 vaccine candidate,
   many previous attempts to develop live attenuated dengue virus vaccines have yielded
   vaccine candidates that were either over- or under-attenuated in humans (Eckels, K.H. et al.
20 1984 Am J Trop Med Hyg 33:684-9; Bhamarapravati, N. & Yoksan, S. 1997 in: Dengue
   and dengue hemorrhagicfeverD.J. Gubler & G. Kuno eds. pp. 367-377 CAB International,
   New York; Innis, B.L. et al. 1988 JInfect Dis 158:876-80; McKee, K.T., Jr. et al. 1987 Am
   J Trop Med Hyg 36:435-42). Therefore, we developed a menu of point mutations which
   confer temperature-sensitive (ts) and attenuation (att) phenotypes upon DEN4.          These
25 mutations are envisioned as being useful to attenuate DEN4 viruses to different degrees and
   therefore as having purpose in fine-tuning the level of attenuation of vaccine candidates
   such as 2AA30. Addition of such mutations to 2AA30 or to other dengue virus vaccine
   candidates is envisioned as resulting in the generation of a vaccine candidate that exhibits a
   satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity for humans.
30         In the present example, chemical mutagenesis of DEN4 has been utilized to identify
   point mutations which confer the ts phenotype, since such viruses often are attenuated in
   humans. Additionally, because of the reported involvement of the liver in natural dengue
                                                -12-

   infection and the elevated ALT levels in a subset of 2AA30 vaccinees, mutagenized DEN4
   viruses were also evaluated for ts phenotype in HuH-7 liver cells derived from a human
   hepatoma. Here, we describe the identification of 20 DEN4 ts mutant viruses each of
   which replicates efficiently in Vero cells, the proposed substrate for vaccine manufacture,
 5 and each of which is attenuated in mice.            Finally, the feasibility of modifying the
   attenuation phenotype of the 2AA30 vaccine candidate by introduction of a point mutation
   in NS3 is demonstrated.
           Cells and viruses. WHO Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells) were
   maintained in MEM (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal
10 bovine serum (FBS) (Summit Biotechnologies, Fort Collins, CO), 2 mM L-glutamine (Life
   Technologies), and 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies).             HuH-7 cells (human
   hepatoma cells) (Nakabayashi, H. et al. 1982 Cancer Res 42:3858-63) were maintained in
   D-MEM/F-12 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM L-glutamine and
   0.05 mg/ml gentamicin. C6/36 cells (Aedes albopictus mosquito cells) were maintained in
15 complete MEM as described above supplemented with 2 mM non-essential amino acids
   (Life Technologies).
            The wild type (wt) DEN4 2A virus was derived from a cDNA clone of DEN4 strain
    814669 (Dominica, 1981) (Men, R. et al. 1996 J Virol 70:3930-7). Sequence of the cDNA
   of DEN 4 2A virus is presented in Appendix 1. The full-length 2A cDNA clone has
20 undergone several subsequent modifications to improve its ability to be genetically
   manipulated. As previously described, a translationally-silent XhoI restriction enzyme site
   was engineered near the end of the E region at nucleotide 2348 to create clone 2A-7oI
    (Bray, M. & Lai, C.J. 1991 PNAS USA 88:10342-6). The viral coding sequence of the 2A
   XhoI cDNA clone was further modified using site-directed mutagenesis to create clone p4:
25  a unique BbvCI restriction site was introduced near the C-prM junction (nucleotides 447
   452); an extra XbaI restriction site was ablated by mutation of nucleotide 7730; and a
    unique SaclI restriction site was created in the NS5 region (nucleotides 9318 - 9320). -Each
    of these engineered mutations is translationally silent and does not change the amino acid
    sequence of the viral polypeptide. Also, several mutations were made in the vector region
30  of clone p4 to introduce or ablate additional restriction sites. The cDNA clone p4A30 was
    generated by introducing the A30 mutation into clone p4. This was accomplished by
    replacing the MluI - KpnI fragment of p4 (nucleotides 10403 - 10654) with that derived
                                                  -13-

   from plasmid 2AA30 containing the 30 nucleotide deletion. The cDNA clones p4 and
   p4A30 were subsequently used to generate recombinant viruses rDEN4 (Appendix 2) and
   rDEN4A30, respectively. (The GenBank accession number for rDEN4 is AF326825 and the
   accession for rDEN4A30 is AF326827).
 5         Chemical mutagenesis of DEN4.            Confluent monolayers of Vero cells were
   infected with wt DEN4 2A at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and incubated for 2
   hours at 32'C. Infected cells were then overlaid with MEM supplemented with 2% FBS
   and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at concentrations ranging from 10 mM to
    10 nM. After incubation at 32'C for five days, cell culture medium was harvested, clarified
10 by centrifugation, and frozen at -70'C. Clarified supernatants were then assayed for virus
   titer by plaque titration in Vero cells. Serial ten-fold dilutions of the clarified supernatant
   were prepared in Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies) and inoculated onto confluent Vero cell
   monolayers in 24-well plates. After incubation at 35"C for two hours, monolayers were
   overlaid with 0.8% methylcellulose (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) in Opti-MEM I
15 supplemented with 2% FBS, gentamicin, and L-glutamine. Following incubation at 35"C
   for five days, plaques were visualized by immunoperoxidase staining.                 Vero cell
   monolayers were fixed in 80% methanol for 30 minutes and washed for 10 minutes with
   antibody buffer which consists of 3.5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Nestle, Solon, OH) in
   phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cells were then incubated for one hour at 37'C with an
20 anti-DEN4 rabbit polyclonal antibody preparation (PRNTO of >1:2000) diluted 1:1,000 in
   antibody buffer. After one wash with antibody buffer, cells were incubated for one hour
   with peroxidase-labeled goat-anti-rabbit IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) diluted 1:500 in
   antibody buffer. Monolayers were washed with PBS, allowed to dry briefly, overlaid with
   peroxidase substrate (KPL), and plaques were counted.
25          Virus yields in cultures treated with 1 mM 5-FU were reduced 100-fold compared
   to untreated cultures, and the virus present in the supernatant from the 1 mM 5-FU-treated
   culture was terminally diluted to derive clones for phenotypic characterization. Briefly, 96
   well plates of Vero cells were inoculated with the 5-FU-treated virus at an MOI that yielded
    10 or fewer virus-positive wells per plate. After a five-day incubation at 35'C, cell culture
30 media from the 96 well plates were temporarily transferred to 96 well plates lacking cells,
    and the positive cultures were identified by immunoperoxidase staining of the infected-cell
   monolayers.     Virus from each positive well was transferred to confluent Vero cell
                                                 -14-

   monolayers in 12 well plates for amplification. Cell culture medium was harvested from
   individual wells five or six days later, clarified by centrifugation, aliquoted to 96 deep-well
   polypropylene plates (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) and frozen at -70"C. A total of 1,248 virus
   clones were prepared from the 1 mM 5-FU-treated cultures. Two wt virus clones, 2A-1 and
 5 2A-13, were generated in the same manner from the 5-FU untreated control cultures.
           Screening of clones for ts and att phenotypes.           The 1,248 virus clones were
   screened for ts phenotype by assessing virus replication at 35"C and 39'C in Vero and
   HuH-7 cells.    Cell monolayers in 96 well plates were inoculated with serial ten-fold
   dilutions of virus in L-15 media (Quality Biologicals, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented
10 with 2% FBS, L-glutamine and gentamicin.              Cells were incubated at the indicated
   temperatures for five days in temperature-controlled water baths, and presence of virus was
   determined by immunoperoxidase staining as described above.                Virus clones which
   demonstrated a 100-fold or greater reduction in titer at 39'C were terminally diluted an
   additional two times and amplified in Vero cells. The efficiency of plaque formation
15 (EOP) at permissive and restrictive temperatures of each triply biologically cloned virus
   suspension was determined as follows.         Plaque titration in Vero and HuH-7 cells was
   performed as described above except virus-infected monolayers were overlaid with 0.8%
   methylcellulose in L-15 medium supplemented with 5% FBS, gentamicin, and L
   glutamine. After incubation of replicate plates for five days at 35, 37, 38, or 39'C in
20 temperature-controlled water baths, plaques were visualized by immunoperoxidase staining
   and counted.
           The replication of DEN4 5-FU ts mutant viruses was evaluated in Swiss Webster
   suckling mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY). Groups of six one-week-old mice were
   inoculated intracranially with 104 PFU of virus diluted in 30 ptl Opti-MEM I. Five days
25 later, mice were sacrificed and brains were removed and individually homogenized in a
   10% suspension of phosphate-buffered Hank's balanced salt solution containing 7.5%
   sucrose, 5 mM sodium glutamate, 0.05 mg/ml ciprofloxacin, 0.06 mg/ml clindamycin, and
   0.0025 mg/ml amphotericin B.            Clarified supernatants were frozen at -70*C and
   subsequently virus titer was determined by titration in Vero cells, and plaques were stained
30 by the immunoperoxidase method described above.
           Sequence analysis of viral genomes.           The nucleotide sequence of the 5-FU
   mutagenized DEN4 viruses was determined. Briefly, genomic viral RNA was isolated
                                                  -15-

   from virus clones with the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and reverse
   transcription was performed using the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System for RT
   PCR (Life Technologies) and random hexamer primers. Advantage cDNA polymerase
   (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used to generate overlapping PCR fragments of
 5 approximately 2,000 nt which were purified by HighPure PCR Product Purification System
   (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).       DEN-specific primers were used in BigDye
   terminator cycle sequencing reactions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and reactions
   were analyzed on a 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed to
   sequence both strands of the PCR product from which consensus sequences were
10 assembled.
           The nucleotide sequence of the 5' and 3' regions of the viral genome were
   determined as above after circularization of the RNA genome. The 5' cap nucleoside of the
   viral RNA was excised using tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (Epicentre Technologies,
   Madison, WI) and the genome was circularized by RNA ligase (Epicentre Technologies).
15 A RT-PCR fragment was generated which overlapped the ligation junction (5' and 3' ends)
   and was sequenced as described above.
           Generation of recombinant DEN4 viruses. The mutation at nt position 4,995 in
   NS3 was introduced into the p4 cDNA construct by site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel,
   T.A. 1985 PNAS USA 82:488-92). The StuI - BstBI (nt 3,619 - 5,072) fragment of p4 was
20 sub-cloned into a modified pUC1 19 vector. The U > C mutation at nt position 4,995 was
   engineered by site-directed mutagenesis into the p4 fragment, cloned back into the p4
   cDNA construct, and the presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis.
   The A30 mutation was introduced into the 3' UTR of the p4-4995 cDNA clone by replacing
   the MluI - KpnI fragment with that derived from the p4A30 cDNA clone, and the presence
25 of the deletion was confirmed by sequence analysis. Full length RNA transcripts were
   prepared from the above cDNA clones by in vitro transcription. Briefly, transcription
   consisted of a 50    1tlreaction mixture containing 1 ptg linearized plasmid, 60 U SP6
   polymerase (New England Biolabs (NEB), Beverly, MA), 1X RNA polymerase buffer (40
   mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.9, 6 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM spermidine, 10 mM dithiothreitol), 0.5 mM
30 m7G(5')ppp(5')G cap analog (NEB),           1 mM each nucleotide triphosphate,      1 U
   pyrophosphatase (NEB), and 80 U RNAse inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).           This
                                                -16-

   reaction mixture was incubated at 40'C for 90 min and the resulting transcripts were
   purified using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
           For transfection of C6/36 cells, RNA transcripts were combined with DOTAP
   liposomal transfection reagent (Roche) in HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.6) and added to
 5 cell monolayers in 6 well plates. After incubation at 32'C for 12-18 hours, the cell culture
   media were removed and replaced with MEM supplemented with 5% FBS, L-glutamine,
   gentamicin and non-essential amino acids.           Cell monolayers were incubated for an
   additional 5 to 7 days and cell culture media were harvested, clarified by centrifugation,
   and assayed for the presence of virus by plaque titration in Vero cells. Recovered viruses
10 were terminally diluted twice as described above, and virus suspensions for further analysis
   were prepared in Vero cells.
           In vitro (tissue culture) and in vivo replication of wt DEN4 and DEN4A30. The
   level of replication of both wt DEN4 2A and the vaccine candidate, 2AA30, was evaluated
   in Vero (monkey kidney) and HuH-7 (human hepatoma) cells (Figure 1), the latter of which
15 has recently been found to efficiently support the replication of DEN2 virus (Lin, Y.L. et
   al. 2000 J Med Virol 60:425-31). The pattern of replication of wt DEN4 2A and 2AA30
   was similar in both cell lines. Viral titers from cultures infected with 2AA30 at an MOI of
   0.01 were slightly reduced compared to wt DEN4 2A at 72 hours, but at later time points
   their level of replication was equivalent. The efficient replication of both DEN4 viruses in
20 each cell line indicated that these continuous lines of cells would be useful for
   characterization of the ts phenotype of the 1248 potential mutant viruses.
           The level of replication of DEN4 virus administered intracerebrally to Swiss
   Webster mice was first determined to assess whether mice could be used to efficiently
   evaluate and quantitate the attenuation phenotype of a large set of mutant viruses. Since the
25 susceptibility of mice to DEN infection is age dependent (Cole, G.A. & Wisseman, C.L.Jr.
    1969 Am JEpideiniol 89:669-80; Cole, G.A. et al. 1973 J Comp Pathol83:243-52), mice
    aged 7 to 21 days were infected with 2A-13 (a clone of DEN4 wild type virus - see below),
   rDEN4 or rDEN4A30, and after five days the brain of each mouse was removed, and the
    level of viral replication was quantitated by plaque assay (Table 1). The results indicated
30 that the two wt DEN4 viruses and the rDEN4A30 vaccine candidate replicated to high titer
    (>6.0 log,PFU/g brain) in 7-day old mice and that the mean viral titers were similar among
   the three viruses. These results demonstrated the feasibility of using 7-day old mice to
                                                  -17-

   screen a large set of mutant viruses, and the high level of replication of wild type and
   vaccine candidate permits one to quantitate the magnitude of the restriction of replication
   specified by an attenuating mutation over a 10,000-fold range.
           Generation and in vitro characterization of DEN4 5-FU mutant viruses.               A
 5 panel of 1,248 DEN4 virus clones was generated from a 5-FU-mutagenized suspension of
   wt DEN4 2A as described above (Figure 2). Each clone was tested in Vero and HuH-7
   cells for the ts phenotype at 39'C, and putative ts mutant viruses were subjected to two
   additional rounds of biological cloning by terminal dilution, and the ts phenotype of each
   further cloned virus population was examined in more detail by determining their efficiency
10 of plating (EOP) at pennissive temperature (35'C) and at various restrictive temperatures
   (Table 2).   One virus (clone 2A-13) without a ts phenotype, which was passaged in an
   identical fashion as the ts mutant viruses, served as the virus to which each of the ts mutant
   viruses was directly compared for both the ts and att phenotypes.
           Thirteen 5-FU mutant viruses were identified which have a ts phenotype in both
15 Vero and HuH-7 cells, and seven mutant viruses were ts only in HuH-7 cells (Table 2).
   Mutant viruses which were ts in Vero cells but not in HuH-7 cells were not identified.
   Temperature-sensitivity was defined as a >2.5 or >3.5 logioPFU/ml reduction in virus titer
   in Vero or HuH-7 cells, respectively, at an indicated temperature when compared to the
   permissive temperature of 35"C.     Wild type DEN4 2A was found to have approximately a
20 0.5 and 1.5 logI 0PFU/ml reduction in virus titer in Vero or HuH-7 cells at 39'C,
   respectively. The A30 deletion did not confer a ts phenotype in Vero or HuH-7 cells and
   exhibited only a slight reduction in virus titer (2.2 logI 0PFU/ml) at 39'C in HuH-7 cells,
   which was less than 10-fold greater than the reduction of wt DEN4 2A at that temperature.
   Several 5-FU mutant viruses had a greater than 10,000-fold reduction in virus titer at 39"C
25 in both.Vero and HuH-7 cells. A complete shut-off in viral replication at 39'C in HuH-7
   cells was observed in five virus clones (#571, 605, 631, 967, and 992) which were not ts in
   Vero cells. Mutations that selectively restrict replication in HuH-7 liver cells may be
   particularly useful in controlling the replication of dengue virus vaccine candidates in the
   liver of vaccinees.
30         Replication of DEN4 5-FU mutant viruses in suckling mice.                The level of
   replication of each of the 20 ts DEN4 mutant viruses in mouse brain was determined (Table
   2). The titers obtained were compared to that of the two wt viruses, 2A-13 and rDEN4,
                                                 -18-

   which each replicated to a level of greater than 106 PFU/g of brain tissue, and to that of the
   2AA30 mutant, which conferred only a limited 0.5 logjPFU/g reduction in mean virus titer
   compared to the wt controls. The observed reduction in the level of rDEN4A30 replication
   was consistent among 11 separate experiments. Interestingly, the rDEN4A30 virus, which
 5 was attenuated in both rhesus monkeys and humans (Example 8), was only slightly
   restricted in replication in mouse brain. Varying levels of restriction of replication were
   observed among the mutant viruses ranging from a 10-fold (#473) to over 6,000-fold
   (#686) reduction. Mutant viruses with ts phenotypes in both Vero and HuH-7 cells, as well
   as in HuH-7 cells alone, were found to have significant att phenotypes. Five of 13 5-FU
10 mutant viruses with ts phenotypes in both Vero and HuH-7 cells and five of seven mutant
   viruses with ts phenotypes in HuH-7 cells alone had greater than a 100-fold reduction in
   virus replication. There appeared to be no direct correlation between the magnitude of the
   reduction in replication at restrictive temperature in tissue culture and the level of
   attenuation in vivo.    The similar level of temperature sensitivity and replication of the
15 rDEN4 wt and clone 2A-13 in mouse brain indicated that observed differences in
   replication between the ts mutant viruses and clone 2A-13 was not simply a function of
   passage in Vero cells, but reflects the sequence differences between these viruses.
            Sequence analysis of DEN4 5-FU mutant viruses. To determine the genetic basis
   of the observed ts and att phenotypes, the complete nucleotide sequence of each ts mutant
20 and of clone 2A-13 was determined and summarized in Table 3 (ts in Vero and HuH-7
   cells) and Table 4 (ts in only HuH-7 cells).
            The only type of mutation identified in the 20 mutant viruses sequenced was a
   nucleotide substitution (no deletions or insertions occurred), and these were present in each
   of the coding regions except C and NS4A.         Three mutant viruses (#239, 489, and 773)
25 contained only a single missense point mutation in NS3 at nt position 4,995 resulting in a
   Ser to Pro amino acid (a.a.) change at a.a. position 1,632. For #773, this was the sole
   mutation present (Table 3). The non-coding mutations in coding regions are not considered
   to be significant. The 17 additional mutant viruses had multiple mutations (two to five) in
    a coding region or in an UTR which could potentially confer the observed ts or att
30 phenotypes. Five of the 17 mutant viruses with multiple mutations (#473, 718, 759, 816,
    and 938) also encoded the point mutation at nt position 4,995. The presence of the 4,995
                                                 -19-

   mutation was found in only DEN4 mutant viruses with ts phenotypes in both Vero and
   HuH-7 cells.
           The sequence analysis indicated that 10 mutant viruses which were ts in Vero and
   HuH-7 cells and three mutant viruses which were ts in only HuH-7 cells contained
 5 mutations in only the 5' and 3' UTR and/or in a nonstructural protein. These mutations are
   especially suitable for inclusion in chimeric dengue virus vaccine candidates in which the
   structural genes derive from a DEN1, DEN2, or DEN3 serotype and the remaining coding
   and non-coding regions come from an attenuated DEN4 vector. Mutations identified in 5
   FU DEN4 mutant viruses which were ts in only HuH-7 cells (Table 4) may potentially be
10 utilized in vaccine candidates, such as rDEN4A30, to selectively control the replication and
   pathogenesis of DEN4 in the liver. These combined results from the sequence analysis of
   5-FU mutant viruses demonstrate the utility of chemical mutagenesis as a means of
   introducing attenuating mutations into the dengue virus genome.
           The presence of a point mutation at nt position 4,995 in eight separate mutant
15 viruses was described above. Five additional point mutations were also represented in
   multiple viruses including nt changes at position 1,455 in E, 7,162, 7,163 and 7,564 in
   NS4B, and 10,275 in the 3' UTR (Table 5). The significance of the occurrence of these
   "sister" mutations in multiple viruses is discussed in Example 6. Interestingly, the wild
   type, parallel-passaged virus, 2A-13, also contained a single mutation at the 7,163 nt
20 position in NS4B.
           Introduction of a ts mutation into rDEN4 and rDEN4A30.            The presence of a
   single nucleotide substitution (U > C mutation at nt position 4,995 in NS3) in three separate
   mutant viruses (clones 239, 489, and 773) indicated that this mutation specified the ts and
   att phenotypes in each of the three mutant viruses. This mutation was cloned into cDNA
25 construct of p4 and p4A30 and recombinant viruses were recovered and designated rDEN4
   4995 and rDEN4A30-4995, respectively. These recombinant viruses were tested for ts and
   att phenotypes as described above (Table 6). As expected, introduction of mutation 4995
   into rDEN4 wt resulted in a significant ts phenotype at 39'C in both Vero and HuH-7 cells.
   rDEN4-4995 grew to nearly wild-type levels at the permissive temperature, 35'C, in both
30 cell types, but demonstrated a greater than 10,000-fold reduction at 39'C (shut-off
   temperature) in both Vero and HuH-7 cells.         The addition of the 4995 mutation to
                                                -20-

   rDEN4A30 yields a recombinant virus, rDEN4A30-4995, that exhibits the same level of
   temperature sensitivity as rDEN4-4995 (Table 6).
           The rDEN4 viruses encoding the 4995 mutation were next tested for replication in
   the brains of suckling mice (Table 6). The 4995 mutation conferred an att phenotype upon
 5 both rDEN4 and rDEN4A30. There was an approximately 1,000-fold reduction in virus
   replication compared to that of wt virus. The combination of point mutation 4995 and the
   A30 deletion did not appear to result in an additive reduction of virus replication. These
   results confirmed that the 4995 point mutation indeed specifies the ts and att phenotypes.
   Importantly, the utility of modifying tissue culture and in vivo phenotypes of the
10 rDEN4A30      vaccine candidate by introduction        of additional mutations was also
   demonstrated.
           Discussion. Herein we teach how to prepare a tetravalent, live-attenuated dengue
   virus vaccine using rDEN4A30 as the DEN4 component and three antigenic chimeric
   viruses expressing the structural proteins (C, prM, and E) of DENI, DEN2, and DEN3 from
15 the attenuated rDEN4A30 vector (Example 8). DEN4 virus rDEN4A30 containing the A30
   deletion mutation in the 3' UTR manifests restricted replication in humans while retaining
   immunogenicity. Since rDEN4A30 retains a low level of residual virulence for humans
   despite this restricted replication, the present study was initiated to generate additional
   attenuating mutations that are envisioned as being useful to further attenuate rDEN4A30 or
20 other dengue viruses and that are envisioned as being incorporated into any of the three
   antigenic chimeric viruses or other dengue viruses as needed.           Temperature-sensitive
   mutants of dengue viruses (Bhamarapravati, N. & Yoksan, S. 1997 in: Dengue and Dengue
   Hemorrhagic Fever D.J. Gubler & G. Kuno eds. pp. 367-377 CAB International, New
   York; Eckels, K.H. et al. 1980 Infect Immun 27:175-80) as well of other viruses
25 (Skiadopoulos, M.H. et al. 1998 J Virol 72:1762-8; Whitehead, S.S. et al. 1999 J Virol
   73:871-7) manifest restricted replication in vivo. We have generated a panel of 20 ts DEN4
   mutant viruses, determined their genomic sequence, and assessed their in vivo attenuation
   phenotypes. The 20 ts DEN4 mutant viruses were generated by growth in the presence of
   5-FU and were first selected for viability in Vero cells, the substrate planned for use in the
30 manufacture of these vaccines, to ensure that the mutant viruses can be grown efficiently in
   a suitable substrate.
                                                 -21-

            Two classes of mutant viruses were obtained; those ts in both Vero and HuH-7 cells
   (n = 13) or those ts in only HuH-7 cells (n = 7). The viruses exhibited a range in their level
   of temperature sensitivity from a 100- to 1,000,000-fold reduction in replication at the
   restrictive temperature of 39'C. Since our DEN4 vaccine candidate retains a low level of
 5 virulence for the liver and other findings support the ability of dengue viruses to infect
   hepatocytes (Lin, Y.L. et al. 2000 J Med Virol 60:425-31; Marianneau, P. et al. 1997 J
    Virol 71:3244-9) and cause liver pathology (Couvelard, A. et al. 1999 Hum Pathol
   30:1106-10; Huerre, M.R. et al. 2001 Virchows Arch 438:107-15), we sought to develop
   mutations that would selectively restrict replication of dengue 4 virus in liver cells. Toward
10 this end, we identified seven mutant viruses which have a HuH-7 cell-specific ts phenotype.
   The mutations present in these viruses are the first reported in DEN viruses that confer
   restricted replication in liver cells and are envisioned as being useful in limiting virus
   replication and pathogenesis in the liver of vaccine recipients.          The contribution of
   individual mutations identified in the HuH-7 cell-specific ts viruses to the observed
15 phenotypes is envisioned as being assessed by introduction of the individual mutations into
   recombinant DEN4 viruses.
            Recent evidence has indicated that the magnitude of the viremia in DEN-infected
   patients positively correlates with disease severity, i.e., the higher the titer of viremia the
   more severe the disease (Murgue, B. et al. 2000 JMed Virol 60:432-8; Vaughn, D.W. et al.
20 2000 J Infect Dis 181:2-9).        This indicates that mutations that significantly restrict
   replication of vaccine candidates in vivo are the foundation of a safe and attenuated vaccine.
   Evaluation of DEN virus vaccine candidates for in vivo attenuation is complicated by the
   lack of a suitable animal model which accurately mimics the disease caused by dengue
   viruses in humans. In the absence of such a model, the replication of the panel of 5-FU
25 mutant viruses in the brains of Swiss Webster suckling mice was assessed as a means to
   identify an in vivo attenuation phenotype since this animal model is well-suited for the
    evaluation of a large set of mutant viruses. Each of the 20 ts mutant viruses exhibited an att
   phenotype manifesting a 10- to 6,000-fold reduction in replication in the brain of mice as
    compared to wt DEN4 virus (Table 2). This indicates that there is a correlation between the
30 presence of the ts phenotype in tissue culture and attenuation of the mutant in vivo
    confirming the utility of selecting viruses with this marker as vaccine candidates.
    However, there was no correlation between the level of temperature sensitivity and the
                                                 -22-

   level of restriction in vivo. Furthermore, Sabin observed a dissociation between mouse
   neurovirulence and attenuation in humans by generating an effective live attenuated virus
   vaccine against DEN by passage of virus in mouse brain. This research actually resulted in
   a highly mouse-neurotropic DEN virus which, paradoxically, was significantly attenuated
 5 in humans (Sabin, A.B. 1952 Am J Trop Med Hyg 1:30-50). Despite this, attenuation for
   the suckling mouse brain has been reported for other live-attenuated DEN virus vaccine
   candidates including the DEN2 PDK-53 vaccine strain which is non-lethal in mice and
   DEN-2 PR-159/S-1 vaccine strain which was significantly attenuated compared to its
   parental wild-type virus (Bhamarapravati, N. & Yoksan, S. 1997 in: Dengue and Dengue
10 Hemorrhagic Fever D.J. Gubler & G. Kuno eds. pp. 367-377 CAB International, New
   York; Butrapet, S. et al. 2000 J Virol 74:3011-9; Eckels, K.H. et al. 1980 Infect Immun
   27:175-80; Innis, B.L. et al. 1988 JInfect Dis 158:876-80). Replication in rhesus monkeys
   has been reported to be predictive of attenuation for humans (Innis, B.L. et al. 1988 JInfect
   Dis 158:876-80). Recently, murine models of DEN virus infection have been developed
15 using SCID mice transplanted with human macrophage (Lin, Y.L. et al. 1998 J Virol
   72:9729-37) or liver cell lines (An, J. et al. 1999 Virology 263:70-7), but these mice have
   not as yet been used to assess att phenotypes of candidate vaccine viruses. Mutant viruses
   or recombinant viruses bearing one or more of these mutations described herein are
   envisioned as being tested for replication in rhesus monkeys (or other suitable animal
20 model) as predictive for attenuation in humans.
           The chemical mutagenesis of DEN4 virus and sequence analysis of resulting viruses
   described here has resulted in the identification of a large number of point mutations
   resulting in amino acid substitutions in all genes except C and NS4A as well as point
   mutations in the 5' and 3' UTR (Tables 3 and 4).          This approach of whole-genome
25 mutagenesis has the benefit of identifying mutations dispersed throughout the entire
   genome which are pre-selected for viability in the Vero cell substrate. Ten 5-FU mutant
   viruses which were ts in Vero and HuH-7 cells and three viruses which were selectively ts
   in HuH-7 cells contained only mutations outside of the genes encoding the structural
   proteins, i.e., in the 5' and 3' UTR or NS genes. These mutations along with the A30
30 deletion in the 3' UTR are particularly suited for inclusion in antigenic, chimeric vaccines
   which consist of an attenuated DEN4 vector bearing the wild-type structural genes (C, prM,
   E) of the other DEN virus serotypes. Use of this strategy has several advantages.       Each
                                                -23-

   antigenic chineric virus that possesses structural proteins from a wild-type virus along with
   attenuating mutations in their UTRs or NS genes should maintain its infectivity for humans,
   which is mediated largely by the E protein, and, therefore, each vaccine component should
   be immunogenic (Huang, C.Y. et al. 2000 J Virol 74:3020-8). The replicative machinery
 5 of the tetravalent vaccine strains would share the same attenuating mutations in the NS
   genes or in the UTR which should attenuate each vaccine component to a similar degree
   and thereby minimize interference or complementation among the four vaccine viruses. In
   addition, wild-type E protein would be expected to most efficiently induce neutralizing
   antibodies against each individual DEN virus.
10         Sequence analysis of dengue viruses (Blok, J. et al. 1992 Virology 187:573-90; Lee,
   E. et al. 1997 Virology 232:281-90; Puri, B. et al. 1997 J Gen Virol 78:2287-91) and
   yellow fever viruses (Dunster, L.M. et al. 1999 Virology 261:309-18; Holbrook, M.R. et al.
   2000 Virus Res 69:31-9) previously generated by serial passage in tissue culture have
   mutations throughout much of the genome, a pattern we have observed in the present study.
15 Recent analysis of the DEN2 PDK-53 vaccine strain has identified the important mutations
   involved in attenuation which were located in non-structural regions including the 5' UTR,
   NS1 and NS3 (Butrapet, S. et al. 2000 J Virol 74:3011-9). This DEN2 vaccine strain has
   been used to generate a chimeric virus with DENI C-prM-E genes (Huang, C.Y. et al. 2000
   J Virol 74:3020-8). In separate studies, the sequence of the DENI vaccine strain 45AZ5
20 PDK-27 was -determined and compared to parental viruses, but the mutations responsible
   for attenuation have not yet been identified (Puri, B. et al. 1997 JGen Virol 78:2287-91).
           Several amino acid substitutions were identified in more than one ts 5-FU mutant
   virus (Table 5). Lee et al. have previously reported finding repeated mutations in separate
   DEN3 virus clones after serial passage in Vero cells (Lee, E. et al. 1997 Virology 232:281
25 90).   A mutation (K > N) identified in E at a.a. position 202 in a single DEN3 passage
   series was also found in our 5-FU mutant virus #1012 (K > E). Mutations observed in the
   5-FU sister mutant viruses are envisioned as representing adaptive changes that confer an
   increased efficiency of DEN4 replication in Vero cells. Such mutations are envisioned as
   being beneficial for inclusion in a live-attenuated DEN virus vaccine by increasing the
30 yield of vaccine virus during manufacture.          Interestingly, three distinct amino acid
   substitutions were found in NS4B of the 5-FU sister mutant viruses. The exact function of
   this gene is unknown, but previous studies of live-attenuated yellow fever vaccines
                                                 -24-

   76:2749-55) and Japanese encephalitis vaccines (Ni, H. et al. 1995 J Gen Virol 76:409-13)
   have identified mutations in NS4B associated with attenuation phenotypes.
            The mutation at nt position 4995 of NS3 (S1632P) was present as the only
 5 significant mutation identified in three 5-FU mutant viruses (#239, #489, and #773). This
   mutation was introduced into a recombinant DEN4 virus and found to confer a ts and att
   phenotype (Table 6).       These observations clearly identify the 4995 mutation as an
   attenuating mutation. Analysis of a sequence alignment (Chang, G.-J. 1997 in: Dengue and
   Dengue HemorrhagicFever D.J. Gubler & G. Kuno, eds. pp. 175-198 CAB International,
10 New York) of the four dengue viruses indicated that the Ser at a.a. position 1632 is
   conserved in DENI and DEN2, while DEN3 contains an Asn at this position indicating that
   the mutation is predicted to be useful in modifying the phenotypes of the other DEN virus
   serotypes.   The NS3 protein is 618 a.a. in length and contains both serine protease and
   helicase activities (Bazan, J.F. & Fletterick, R.J. 1989 Virology 171:637-9; Brinkworth, R.I.
15 et al. 1999 J Gen Virol 80:1167-77; Valle, R.P. & Falgout, B. 1998 J Virol 72:624-32).
   The 4995 mutation results in a change at a.a. position 158 in NS3 which is located in the N
   terminal region containing the protease domain. Amino acid position 158 is located two
   a.a. residues away from an NS3 conserved region designated homology box four. This
   domain has been identified in members of the flavivirus family and is believed to be a
20 critical determinant of the NS3 protease substrate specificity (Bazan, J.F. & Fletterick, R.J.
    1989 Virology 171:637-9; Brinkworth, R.I. et al. 1999 J Gen Virol 80:1167-77). However,
   the exact mechanism which results in the phenotype associated with the 4995 mutation has
   not yet been identified. The identification of the 4995 mutation as an attenuating mutation
   permits a prediction of its usefulness for the further attenuation of rDEN4A30.
25          We have determined the contribution of individual 5-FU mutations to the observed
   phenotypes by introduction of the mutations into recombinant DEN4 viruses as was
   demonstrated herein for the 4995 mutation (see Example 3). In addition, combination of
   individual mutations with each other or with the A30 mutation is useful to further modify
   the attenuation phenotype of DEN4 virus candidate vaccines. The introduction of the 4995
30 mutation into rDEN4A30 described herein rendered the rDEN4A30-4995 double mutant ts
   and 1000-fold more attenuated for the mouse brain than rDEN4A30. This observation has
   demonstrated the feasibility of modifying both tissue culture and in vivo phenotypes of this
                                                  -25-

   and other dengue virus vaccine candidates. Once the mutations responsible for the HuH-7
   cell-specific ts phenotype are identified as described above and introduced into the
   rDEN4A30 vaccine candidate, we envision confirming that these mutations attenuate
   rDEN4A30 vaccine virus for the liver of humans. A menu of attenuating mutations is
 5 envisioned as being assembled that is predicted to be useful in generating satisfactorily
   attenuated recombinant dengue vaccine viruses and in increasing our understanding of the
   pathogenesis of dengue virus (see Example 7).

     Chemical Mutagenesis of DEN4 Virus Results in Small-Plaque Mutant Viruses with
10                     Temperature-Sensitive and Attenuation Phenotypes
            Mutations that restrict replication of dengue virus have been sought for the
   generation of recombinant live-attenuated dengue virus vaccines.        Dengue virus type 4
   (DEN4) was previously grown in Vero cells in the presence of 5-fluorouracil, and the
   characterization    of 1,248 mutagenized,      Vero   cell-passaged    clones identified 20
15 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant viruses that were attenuated (att) in suckling mouse brain
    (Example 1).      The present investigation has extended these studies by identifying an
    additional 22 DEN4 mutant viruses which have a small-plaque size (sp) phenotype in Vero
    cells and/or the liver cell line, HuH-7. Five mutant viruses have a sp phenotype in both
   Vero and HuH-7 cells, three of which are also ts. Seventeen mutant viruses have a sp
20 phenotype in only HuH-7 cells, thirteen of which are also ts. Each of the sp viruses was
    growth restricted in the suckling mouse brain, exhibiting a wide range of reduction in
    replication (9- to 100,000-fold). Complete nucleotide sequence was determined for the 22
    DEN4 sp mutant viruses, and nucleotide substitutions were found in the 3' untranslated
    region (UTR) as well as in all coding regions except NS4A. Identical mutations have been
25  identified in multiple virus clones indicating that they are involved in the adaptation of
    DEN4 virus to efficient growth in Vero cells.
            The DEN viruses cause more disease and death of humans than any other arbovirus,
    and more than 2.5 billion people live in regions with endemic dengue infection (Gubler,
    D.J. 1998 Clin Microbiol Rev 11:480-96). Annually, there are an estimated 50-100 million
30  cases of dengue fever (DF) and 500,000 cases of the more severe and potentially lethal
    dengue hemorrhagic fever / dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) (Gubler, D.J. & Meltzer,
    M. 1999 Adv Virus Res 53:35-70). Dengue fever is an acute infection characterized by
                                                -26-

   fever, retro-orbital headache, myalgia, and rash. At the time of defervescence during DF, a
   more severe complication of DEN virus infection, DHF/DSS, may occur which is
   characterized by a second febrile period, hemorrhagic manifestations, hepatomegaly,
   thrombocytopenia, and hemoconcentration, which may lead to potentially life-threatening
 5 shock (Gubler, D.J. 1998 Clin MicrobiolRev 11:480-96).
           The sites of DEN virus replication in humans and their importance and relationship
   to the pathogenesis of DF and DHF/DSS are still incompletely understood (Innis, B.L.
   1995 in: Exotic Viral Infections J.S. Porterfield, ed. pp. 103-146 Chapman and Hall,
   London). In addition to replication in lymphoid cells, it has become evident that the liver is
10 involved in DEN infection of humans.              Transient elevations in serum alanine
   aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels are observed in the
   majority of DEN virus-infected patients and hepatomegaly is observed in some patients
   (Kalayanarooj, S. et al. 1997 J Infect Dis 176:313-21; Kuo, C.H. et al. 1992 Am J Trop
   Med Hyg 47:265-70; Mohan, B. et al. 2000 J Trop Pediatr46:40-3; Wahid, S.F. et al. 2000
15 Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health 31:259-63).            DEN virus antigen-positive
   hepatocytes are seen surrounding areas of necrosis in the liver of fatal cases (Couvelard, A.
   et al. 1999 Hum Pathol30:1106-10; Huerre, M.R. et al. 2001 Virchows Arch 438:107-15),
   from which dengue virus sequences were identified using RT-PCR (Rosen, L. et al. 1999
   Am J Trop Med Hyg 61:720-4). Of potential importance to the etiology of severe dengue
20 virus infection, three studies have demonstrated that the mean levels of serum ALT and
   AST were significantly increased in patients with DHF/DSS compared to those with DF
   (Kalayanarooj, S. et al. 1997 JlnfectDis 176:313-21; Mohan, B. et al. 2000 JTrop Pediatr
   46:40-3; Wahid, S.F. et al. 2000 Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health 31:259-63).
   As expected, elevation of serum liver enzymes has previously been observed in clinical
25 trials of DEN virus vaccine candidates (Example 8; Eckels, K.H. et al. 1984 Am J Trop
   Med Hyg 33:684-9; Edelman, R. et al. 1994 JInfect Dis 170:1448-55; Kanesa-thasan, N. et
   al. 2001 Vaccine 19:3179-3188; Vaughn, D.W. et al. 1996 Vaccine 14:329-36).
           Based on the increasing disease burden associated with DEN virus infection over
   the past several decades, a vaccine which confers protection against the four dengue virus
30 serotypes is needed, but none is presently licensed. Because of the increased risk for severe
   DHF/DSS associated with secondary infection with a heterologous DEN virus serotype
   (Burke, D.S. et al. 1988 Am J Trop Med Hyg 38:172-80; Halstead, S.B. et al. 1977 J Exp
                                                -27-

   Med 146:218-29; Thein, S. et al. 1997 Am J Trop Med Hyg 56:566-72), an effective
   vaccine must confer simultaneous protection against each of the four DEN virus serotypes.
   Several approaches are presently being pursued to develop a tetravalent vaccine against the
   dengue viruses (Bancroft, W.H. et al. 1984 JInfect Dis 149:1005-10; Bhamarapravati, N.
 5 & Sutee, Y. 2000 Vaccine 18:44-7; Butrapet, S. et al. 2000 J Virol 74:3011-9; Guirakhoo,
   F. et al. 2000 J Virol 74:5477-85; Huang, C.Y. et al. 2000 J Virol 74:3020-8; Kanesa
   thasan, N. et al. 2001 Vaccine 19:3179-3188). One such approach, a live-attenuated DEN4
   vaccine candidate, termed 2AA30, was both attenuated and immunogenic in a cohort of 20
   volunteers (Example 8). The recombinant 2AA30 virus contains a 30 nt deletion in the 3'
10 UTR which removes nucleotides 10,478-10,507 and was found to produce a low or
   undetectable level of viremia in vaccinees at a dose of 10' PFU/vaccinee.                   An
   asymptomatic rash was reported in 50% of volunteers, and the only laboratory abnormality
   observed was an asymptomatic, transient rise in the serum ALT level in 5 of the 20
   vaccinees. All 2AA30 vaccinees developed serum neutralizing antibodies against DEN4
15 virus (mean titer: 1:580), and 2AA30 was not transmitted to mosquitoes that fed
   experimentally on vaccinees (Troyer, J.M. et al. 2001 Am J Trop Med Hyg 65:414-9).
   Because of the desirable properties conferred by the A30 mutation, chimeric vaccine
   candidates are being constructed which contain the structural genes of DEN virus type 1, 2,
   and 3, in the attenuated DEN4 background bearing the genetically stable A30 mutation.
20 Attenuating mutations outside of the structural genes are particularly attractive for inclusion
   in antigenic chimeric vaccine candidates because they will not affect the infectivity or
   immunogenicity conferred by the major mediator of humoral immunity to DEN viruses, the
   envelope (E) protein.
            The presence of rash and elevated ALT levels suggests that the 2AA30 vaccine
25 candidate may be slightly under-attenuated in humans. Similarly, many previous attempts
   to develop live attenuated dengue virus vaccines have yielded vaccine candidates that were
    either over- or under-attenuated in humans, some of which also induced elevation of serum
   ALT and AST levels (Bhamarapravati, N. & Yoksan, S. 1997 in: Dengue and Dengue
   Hemorrhagic Fever D.J. Gubler & G. Kuno eds. pp. 367-377 CAB International, New
30 York; Eckels, K.H. et al. 1984 Am J Trop Med Hyg 33:684-9; Innis, B.L. et al. 1988 J
   Infect Dis 158:876-80; Kanesa-thasan, N. et al. 2001 Vaccine 19:3179-3188; McKee, K.T.,
   Jr. et al. 1987 Am J Trop Med Hyg 36:435-42). Therefore, we have developed a menu of
                                                -28-

   point mutations conferring temperature-sensitive (ts), small-plaque (sp), and attenuation
   (att) phenotypes capable of attenuating DEN4 viruses to a varying degree (Example 1). We
   have previously described 20 mutant viruses that exhibit a ts, but not sp, phenotype in Vero
   cells or HuH-7 liver cells and that show attenuated replication in mouse brain (Example 1).
 5 Addition of such mutations to 2AA30 or to other dengue virus vaccine candidates is
   envisioned as yielding vaccine candidates that exhibit a more satisfactory balance between
   attenuation and immunogenicity.
           In the present Example, we have extended our analysis of the panel of 1,248 DEN4
   virus clones previously generated by mutagenesis with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Example 1),
10 by identifying a set of 22 sp mutant viruses, some of which also have a ts phenotype. Small
   plaque mutant viruses were sought since such viruses are often attenuated in humans

   Takemoto, K.K. 1966 Prog Med Virol 8:314-48). Because natural infection with dengue
   viruses and vaccination with 2AA30 may be associated with liver toxicity in humans, we
20 identified mutant viruses with restricted replication in human liver cells.     Accordingly,
   viruses were screened for plaque size and temperature-sensitivity in the human hepatoma
   cell line, HuH-7, as well as in Vero cells. Here we describe the ts phenotype, nucleotide
   sequence, and growth properties in suckling mice of 22 sp DEN4 mutant virus clones.
            Cells and viruses.    WHO Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells) and
25 HuH-7 cells (human hepatoma cells) (Nakabayashi, H. et al. 1982 CancerRes 42:3858-63)
   were maintained as described in Example 1. DEN4 2A virus is a wild type virus derived
   from a cDNA clone of DEN4 strain 814669 (Dominica, 1981) (Lai, C.J. et al. 1991 PNAS
   USA 88:5139-43; Mackow, E. et al. 1987 Virology 159:217-28). The nucleotide sequence
   of DEN4 2A, the parent of the 5-FU mutant viruses, was previously assigned GenBank
30 accession number AF375822 (Example 1).             The DEN4 vaccine candidate, 2AA30,
   (Example 8) contains a 30 nt deletion in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) which removes
   nucleotides 10,478-10,507 (Men, R. et al. 1996 J Virol 70:3930-7). The cDNA clones p4,

   a modified derivative of the DEN4 2A cDNA clone, and p4A30 were used to generate
   recombinant wild type and attenuated viruses, rDEN4 and rDEN4A30, respectively
   (Example 8). GenBank accession numbers were previously assigned as follows (virus:
   accession number): DEN4 strain 814669: AF326573; 2AA30: AF326826; rDEN4:
 5 AF326825; rDEN4A30: AF326827.
            Generation and biological cloning of mutant viruses with a sp phenotype. The
   generation of 1,248 virus clones from a pool of 5-fluorouracil-mutagenized DEN4 2A has
   been previously described (Example 1). Briefly, monolayers of Vero cells were infected
   with DEN4 2A at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and overlaid with MEM
10 supplemented with 2% FBS and 1 mM 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO),
   which reduced replication of DEN4 2A 100-fold.            Vero cells in 96-well plates were
   inoculated with the 5-FU treated virus suspension, and virus clones were harvested from
   plates receiving terminally-diluted virus. A total of 1,248 virus clones were generated from
   the cultures treated with 1 mM 5-FU. Two virus clones, 2A-1 and 2A-13, were generated
15 in the same manner from control cultures not treated with 5-FU and served as parallel
   passaged control viruses with a wild type phenotype.
            Evaluation of in vitro plaque size and temperature sensitivity. The 1,248 5-FU
   mutagenized virus clones were screened for temperature sensitivity by assessing virus
   replication at 35'C (permissive temperature) and 39'C (restrictive temperature) in Vero and
20 HuH-7 cells.     Cell monolayers in 96-well plates were inoculated with serial ten-fold
   dilutions of virus and replicate plates were incubated at 35'C and 39'C for five days in
   temperature-controlled     water    baths.      Virus    replication   was    determined    by
   immunoperoxidase staining as previously described (Example 1). A collection of 193 5-FU
   virus clones demonstrated a 100-fold or greater reduction in titer at 39'C in either cell line,
25  and these presumptive ts viruses were further characterized.        The efficiency of plaque
    formation (EOP) at permissive and restrictive temperatures and the plaque size of each of
    the 193 virus clones were determined as follows.          Serial ten-fold dilutions of virus
    suspension were inoculated onto confluent Vero cell and HuH-7 cell monolayers in
    replicate 24-well plates. After incubation at 35'C for two hours, monolayers were overlaid
30 with 0.8% methylcellulose (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) in L-15 medium (Quality
    Biologicals, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 2% FBS, gentamicin, and L-glutamine.
    After incubation of replicate plates for five days at 35, 37, 38, or 39'C in temperature
                                                -30-

   controlled water baths, plaques were visualized by immunoperoxidase staining and counted
   as previously described.      Plaque size of each of the 193 viruses was evaluated at the
   permissive temperature (35"C) and compared to that of DEN4 2A-13 parallel-passaged
   control virus with a wild type plaque size. Mutant viruses incubated at the permissive
 5 temperature of 35'C which had a plaque size 1 mn or 50.4 mm (approximately 50% the
   size of wild type DEN4 2A-13) in Vero or HuH-7 cells, respectively, were designated as
   having a sp phenotype. The level of temperature sensitivity and plaque size of each virus
   was confirmed in at least two separate experiments.        Seventy-five viruses which were
   confirmed to have a putative ts and/or sp phenotype were biologically cloned an additional
10 two times and phenotypes were re-assessed.         Twenty-two of the 75 terminally diluted
   viruses were found to have a sp phenotype. Sixteen of the 22 sp mutant viruses were also
   found to have a ts phenotype as defined by a 2.5 or 3.5 log,0PFU/nl reduction in virus titer
   in Vero or HuH-7 cells, respectively, at restrictive temperature compared to the permissive
   temperature of 35'C as previously described (Example 1). Twenty of the 75 terminally
15 diluted viruses were found to have a ts phenotype without a sp phenotype and were
   previously described (Example 1).      The remainder of the 75 viruses did not meet either
   criteria for a ts or sp mutant virus.
            Evaluation of sp mutant viruses for restricted replication in suckling mice.
   Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the regulations and guidelines of
20 the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. Growth of DEN4 5-FU mutant viruses
   was detennined in Swiss Webster suckling mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY).
   Groups of six seven-day-old mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 104 PFU of virus in
   30 pl Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) and the brain of each mouse was removed five days later
   and individually analyzed as previously described (Example 1). Clarified supernatants of
25 10% suspensions of mouse brain were frozen at -70 C, and the virus titer was determined
   by plaque assay in Vero cells.
            Determination of the complete genomic sequence of the sp mutant viruses. The
   nucleotide sequence of the 5-FU-mutagenized DEN4 viruses was determined as described
   in Example 8. Briefly, genomic RNA was isolated from virus clones and cDNA was
30 prepared by reverse transcription and served as template for the generation of overlapping
   PCR fragments. A panel of primers was designed to sequence both strands of the PCR
   product from which consensus sequences were assembled and analyzed. The nucleotide
                                                -31-

   sequence of the 5' and 3' regions of the virus genome was determined after circularization
   of the RNA genome as described in Example 8.
           Identification of DEN4 5-fluorouracil mutant viruses with a sp phenotype. The
   generation of a panel of 1,248 virus clones from a wild type DEN4 2A virus suspension
 5 mutagenized by 5-FU has been described previously (Example 1). In the present study
   twenty-two mutant viruses with a sp phenotype were identified.           The plaque size of
   representative mutant viruses is illustrated in Figure 3. The plaque size of DEN4 2A-13
   virus (a parallel-passaged virus with a wild type phenotype derived from control cultures
   not treated with 5-FU) was consistently smaller in HuH-7 cells than that observed in Vero
10 cells (Figure 3A). Mutant viruses #569 and #1189 (Figure 3B) were sp in both Vero and
   HuH-7 cells. In contrast, 5-FU mutant virus clones #311 and #1083 (Figure 3C) were sp in
   only HuH-7 cells, suggesting a liver cell-specific defect in replication within this
   phenotypic group. As indicated in Table 7, five mutant viruses were found to have a sp
   phenotype in both Vero and HuH-7 cells while 17 viruses had a sp phenotype in only HuH
15 7 cells. Each 5-FU mutant virus clone was compared for a sp or ts phenotype with three
   control viruses, 2A-13, wild type rDEN4, and rDEN4A30.             The recombinant viruses,
   rDEN4 and rDEN4A30, each had a plaque size in Vero and HuH-7 cells similar to that of
   DEN4 2A-13 indicating that the A30 mutation does not confer a sp phenotype (Table 7).
           Most of the sp 5-FU mutant viruses also had a ts phenotype in Vero and/or HuH-7
20 cells (Table 7) since mutant viruses were initially screened for temperature sensitivity.
   Temperature-sensitivity was defined as a 2.5 or 3.5 log1 PFU/ml reduction in virus titer in
   Vero or HuH-7 cells, respectively, at restrictive temperature compared to the permissive
   temperature of 35'C as previously defined (Example 1).          Three mutant viruses (#574,
   #1269 and #1189) were sp and ts in both Vero and HuH-7 cells, while nine mutant viruses
25 (#506-326 in Table 7) were found to be ts in both cell types but sp only in HuH-7 cells.
   Four viruses (#1104, 952, 738, and 1083) were found to have a wild type phenotype in
   Vero cells but were both sp and ts in HuH-7 cells. These four mutant viruses each had a
   6,000- to 600,000-fold reduction in virus titer at 39'C in HuH-7 cells with only a 6- to 40
   fold reduction at 39'C in Vero cells. Finally, sp mutant viruses were identified which did
30 not have a ts phenotype in either cell line; two of these viruses (#569 and #761) were sp in
   both Vero and HuH-7 cells and four viruses (#1096-1012) were sp in only HuH-7 cells
                                                 -32-

   (Table 7). As described previously, the A30 mutation did not confer temperature-sensitivity
   in either cell line (Example 1).
           The sp 5-FU mutant viruses have restricted replication in suckling mouse
   brain. The 22 sp DEN4 5-FU mutant viruses were evaluated for their ability to replicate in
 5 the brain of one-week-old suckling mice. As a marker for in vivo attenuation, their level of
   replication was compared with that of the parallel-passaged control virus with a wild type
   phenotype, 2A-13 (Table 7). Nineteen of 22 sp mutant viruses had a greater than 100-fold
   reduction in virus replication in the brain of suckling mice compared to 2A-13 and nine
   viruses had a reduction of greater than 10,000-fold.
10         The five mutant viruses which were sp in both Vero and HuH-7 cells were 5,000
   fold to 100,000-fold restricted in replication compared to 2A-13.        Two of these mutant
   viruses, #569 and #761, were not ts in either cell line but had a reduction in virus titer of
   greater than 10,000-fold in mouse brain, indicating that the sp phenotype in both Vero and
   HuH-7 cells is an important surrogate marker for attenuated replication in suckling mouse
15 brain. 5-FU mutant viruses which were sp in only HuH-7 cells had a more variable range
   of replication in mouse brain. Three viruses had a mean reduction in virus titer of less than
    10-fold when compared to 2A-13 virus. However, 8 of 13 viruses which were ts in Vero
   and/or HuH-7 cells but sp in only HuH-7 cells had a greater than 5,000-fold reduction in
   virus replication. The results of the in vivo replication analysis of the previously described
20 20 ts 5-FU mutant viruses (Example 1) and the 22 sp mutant viruses are summarized in
   Table 8. Mutant viruses with both a sp and ts phenotype were found to have a significantly
   greater level of attenuation in the brain of suckling mice when compared to viruses with
   only a ts phenotype.
            Sequence analysis of the sp 5-FU mutant viruses. To initiate an analysis of the
25 genetic basis of the ts, sp, or att phenotype of the 22 sp mutant viruses, the complete
   nucleotide sequence of each virus genome was determined and is summarized in Table 9
    (sp in Vero and HuH-7 cells) and Table 10 (sp in only HuH-7 cells).             All identified
   mutations were nucleotide substitutions, as deletions or insertions were not observed. Point
   mutations were distributed throughout the genome, including the 3' UTR as well as in all
30  coding regions. Because all 5-FU mutant viruses were found to have at least two mutations
    (two to six), the observed phenotypes cannot be directly attributed to a specific mutation.
    The majority of sp viruses also contained translationally silent point mutations (none to
                                                 -33-

   four) in the structural or non-structural coding regions. However, these silent mutations are
   not expected to contribute to the observed phenotypes. Six of the 22 sp mutant viruses
   (Tables 9 and 10) were found to have mutations in only the NS genes and/or the 3' UTR,
   indicating that the sp phenotype can be conferred by mutations outside of the structural
 5 genes.
           Presence of identical mutations in multiple 5-FU mutant viruses. Analysis of
   the complete nucleotide sequence data for the 5-FU mutant viruses identified several
   repeated mutations which were present in two or more viruses. Such mutations were also
   identified previously during our analysis of twenty 5-FU mutant viruses with a ts but not sp
10 phenotype (Example 1).        Because these mutations occurred in viruses together with
   additional mutations, the contribution of the repeated mutations to the observed sp, ts, and
   att phenotypes remains empirical. Table 11 lists the repeated mutations found among the
   20 ts (not sp) mutant viruses described previously (Example 1) and the 22 sp mutant viruses
   described here. Repeated mutations were identified in the following genes: two in E, two
15 in NS3, five in NS4B, one in NS5, and two in the 3' UTR. Interestingly, within a thirty
   nucleotide region of NS4B (nt 7153-7182), there were five different nucleotide
   substitutions which were found in sixteen viruses. Also at nt 7,546 in NS4B, an amino acid
   substitution (Ala -> Val) was found in 10 different 5-FU mutant viruses. The significance
   of these repeated mutations in NS4B as well as in other DEN4 genomic regions remains
20 empirical, but a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is that these mutations are
   involved in adaptation of DEN4 virus for efficient growth in Vero cells, as further
   discussed in Example 6.
           Discussion. As part of a molecular genetic vaccine strategy, we have developed
   attenuating mutations that are envisioned as being useful in the development of a live
25 attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccine.          Specifically, mutations which restrict
   replication of the vaccine virus in human liver cells were generated since there was some
   residual virulence of the rDEN4A30 vaccine candidate for the liver of humans. Mutant
   viruses with a sp phenotype were sought in both Vero cells and HuH-7 human liver cells, in
   order to identify host-range mutant viruses that were specifically restricted in replication in
30 HuH-7 cells (sp in HuH-7 but not in Vero). Such mutations are envisioned as being useful
   in limiting replication of a candidate vaccine in the liver of vaccinees while preserving both
   efficient replication in Vero cells and immunogenicity in vivo.
                                                 -34-

           Several observations from the present study indicate that sp mutations confer an att
   phenotype in vivo.    This is not surprising since attenuation in suckling mouse brain has
   been reported for live DEN virus vaccine candidates possessing sp phenotypes, including
   the DEN2 PDK-53 and DEN2 PR-159/S-1 vaccine strains (Bhamarapravati, N. & Yoksan,
 5 S. 1997 in: Dengue and Dengue HemorrhagicFever D.J. Gubler & G. Kuno eds. pp. 367
   377 CAB International, New York; Butrapet, S. et al. 2000 J Virol 74:3011-9; Eckels, K.H.
   et al. 1980 Infect linmun 27:175-80; Innis, B.L. et al. 1988 JInfect Dis 158:876-80). Each
   of 22 DEN4 5-FU mutant viruses with a sp phenotype (some of which were also ts) in,
   either Vero or HuH-7 cells manifested restricted replication in the brains of mice. Six 5-FU
10 mutant viruses with a sp phenotype in the absence of a ts phenotype were more attenuated
   in the brains of suckling mice than mutant viruses with solely a ts phenotype (Example 1),
   indicating that the sp phenotype specifies a greater level of attenuation for mouse brain than
   does the ts phenotype. Mutant viruses with both a ts and sp phenotype had an even greater
   reduction in replication, further indicating that the attenuation conferred by the ts and sp
15 phenotypes can be additive. Importantly, seventeen of the 22 sp mutant viruses were host
   range sp mutant viruses, being sp only in HuH-7 cells. Since such mutations are envisioned
   as being useful in restricting the replication of a DEN4 virus in human liver cells, we used
   nucleotide sequence analysis to determine the genetic basis of the sp phenotype.
           Analysis of the complete genomic sequence of the 22 sp DEN4 viruses revealed
20 substitutions in the 3' UTR as well as coding mutations in all genes except NS4A. It was
   first noted that several specific mutations were present in two or more of the 22 sp DEN4
   mutant viruses and that many of these same mutations were also previously identified
   among the set of 20 ts DEN4 mutant viruses (Example 1). Since flaviviruses can rapidly
   accumulate mutations during passage in tissue culture (Dunster, L.M. et al. 1999 Virology
25 261:309-18; Mandl, C.W. et al. 2001 J Virol 75:5627-37), many of these over-represented
   mutations, previously referred to as putative Vero cell adaptation mutations (Example 1),
   likely promote efficient replication in Vero cells and were selected unintentionally during
   the biological cloning of the mutant viruses. The effect of these mutations on DEN virus
   replication in Vero cells, the proposed substrate for vaccine manufacture, is discussed in
30 Example 6.
           The sp mutations identified among the 5-FU mutant viruses are envisioned as being
   useful in several different approaches for the development of DEN virus vaccine strains.
                                                 -35-

   As described above for the generation of antigenic chimeric viruses, one or more sp
   attenuating mutations are envisioned as being added to the attenuated DEN4A30 genetic
   background to supplement the att phenotype of the A30 mutation. A second approach is to
   introduce a sp attenuating mutation, with or without A30, into infectious cDNA clones of
 5 the other three DEN serotypes. The ability to transfer mutations among genetically-related
   viruses   and maintain similar att phenotypes        has been previously demonstrated
   (Skiadopoulos, M.H. et al. 1999 Virology 260:125-35).          These distinct strategies are
   envisioned as being useful as separate or complementary approaches to the construction of
   a tetravalent DEN virus vaccine, underlining the importance of the identification of a large
10 panel of att mutations within the DEN viruses.
                                            Example 3
   Recombinant DEN4 Viruses Containing Mutations Identified in 5-FU Mutant Viruses
   show Restricted Replication in Suckling Mouse Brain and in SCID Mice Transplanted
                                     with Human Liver Cells
15         Data was presented in Examples 1 and 2 that summarizes the generation,
   characterization and sequence analysis of 42 attenuated mutant DEN4 viruses. For three of
   the mutant viruses (#239, 489, and 773) with a single missense mutation at nt position 4995
   in NS3, it was clear that the identified mutation specified the ts and att phenotypes. This
   conclusion was confirmed in Example 1 by tissue culture and in vivo characterization of
20 rDEN4-4995, a recombinant virus into which the 4995 mutation had been introduced by
   site-directed mutagenesis.    In this analysis, rDEN4-4995 exhibited the same level of
   temperature sensitivity and attenuation as 5-FU mutant viruses #239, 489, and 773. The
   individual mutation(s) in the remaining 5-FU mutant viruses that specify the observed
   phenotypes remains to be identified, since most of these viruses possess more than one
25 nucleotide substitution. We have conducted an analysis to identify the mutations in a
   subset of the other 39 mutant viruses that specify the ts, sp, and att phenotypes by
   introduction of each mutation into the wt DEN4 cDNA (p4) and evaluation of the
   phenotypes of the resulting recombinant DEN4 viruses bearing the individual mutations.
   Previous studies of a DEN2 virus vaccine candidate (Butrapet, S. et al. 2000 J Virol
30 74:3011-9) as well as other virus vaccines (Whitehead, S.S. et al. 1999 J Virol 73:871-7)
   have demonstrated the utility of this approach for the identification of the genetic basis of
   attenuation.
                                               -36-

           As described in Examples 1 and 2, 19 5-FU mutant viruses were identified which
   were found to contain coding mutations in only the NS genes and/or nucleotide
   substitutions in the 5' or 3' UTR which would facilitate the generation of antigenic
   chimeric viruses. In the present example, the genetic basis of the observed sp, ts, and
 5 mouse brain att phenotypes was identified for these 19 viruses using reverse genetics to
   generate recombinant DEN4 (rDEN4) viruses containing individual mutations identified in
   the panel of DEN4 mutant viruses. In addition, the 19 5-FU mutant viruses were evaluated
   for replication in a novel small animal model for DEN4 virus replication, SCID mice
   transplanted with HuH-7 cells (SCID-HuH-7), and the genetic basis of the att viruses was
10 identified using mutant rDEN4 viruses.          Also presented are findings describing the
   generation and characterization of a recombinant virus containing two of the identified
   attenuating mutations as well as combination of select 5-FU mutations with the A30
   mutation.
           Generation of rDEN4 viruses containing 5-FU mutations. The methods used for
15 the generation of rDEN4 viruses are outlined in Figure 4 and are similar to those described
   in Example 1. Briefly, the p4 cDNA was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes
   and the resulting fragments were subcloned into a modified pUCI 19 vector. For Kunkel
   mutagenesis, single-stranded DNA preparations of the pUC-NS vectors were made, and
   primers were designed to individually introduce mutations that were present in the 5-FU
20 mutant viruses. The sequences of the 41 mutagenic oligonucleotides used to generate the
   single-mutation recombinant viruses are presented in Table 12. Primers were designed to
   co-introduce or co-ablate a translationally-silent restriction enzyme site in the cDNA, which
   greatly facilitates the screening and identification of cDNA clones possessing the mutant
   sequence. Fragments containing the introduced mutations were cloned back into p4, and
25 nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed the presence of the nucleotide changes. A total of
   33 rDEN4 viruses was generated which contained each of the individual mutations present
   in the 19 5-FU mutant viruses containing only coding mutations in the NS genes and/or
   nucleotide substitutions in the 5' or 3' UTR.          An additional 8 rDEN4 viruses were
   generated from mutations identified in the remaining panel of 42 5-FU mutant viruses.
30         A cDNA clone was also generated which combined the mutations identified at nt
   position 4995 in NS3 and 7849 in NS5. The 7849 mutation was introduced into the p4
   4995 cDNA clone by replacing the Xnal - PstI fragment with that derived from the p4
                                                 -37-

   7849 cDNA clone. The presence of both mutations was confirmed by sequence analysis.
   The A30 mutation was introduced into the 3' UTR of the individual mutant cDNA clones
   by replacing the MluI - KpnI fragment with that derived from the p4A30 cDNA clone, and
   the presence of the deletion was confirmed by sequence analysis.
 5         Recombinant viruses were recovered by transfection of Vero or C6/36 cells with
   RNA transcripts derived from the mutant cDNA clones as described in Example 1.
   Recovered viruses were terminally diluted twice and working stocks of viruses were
   prepared in Vero cells. Each of the mutant cDNA clones was recovered after transfection
   as expected since the 5-FU mutant viruses containing these mutations were viable.
10         Characterization of ts and att phenotypes of the rDEN4 viruses containing
   introduced mutations. Of the 19 5-FU mutant viruses with mutations in only NS genes
   and/or the 5' or 3' UTR, six had an sp phenotype (Table 13), ten had a ts phenotype in Vero
   and HuH-7 cells (Table 14), and three had a ts phenotype in only HuH-7 cells (Table 15).
   For the six sp 5-FU mutant viruses, #738, 922, 1081, 1083, 1136, and 1189, seventeen
15 mutations identified by sequence analysis resulted in a coding change or a nucleotide
   change in the UTR and each was engineered into an individual DEN4 cDNA clone. Virus
   containing each defined mutation was successfully recovered and propagated and was
   tested for efficiency of plaque formation in Vero and HuH-7 cells at various temperatures,
   plaque size phenotype, and growth properties in suckling mice using methods previously
20 described in Examples 1 and 2.
           Table 13 lists the phenotypes of the six sp 5-FU mutant parent viruses and those of
   the 17 rDEN4 viruses encoding single mutations present in the parent virus. For    example,
   5-FU mutant #1189 (parent), which was ts and sp in both cell lines and had an almost
    10,000-fold reduction in replication in suckling mouse brain, contained 4 coding mutations
25 at nt position 3303 in NS1, 4812 and 5097 in NS3, and 7182 in NS4B. Analysis of the four
   rDEN4 viruses containing each of these mutations indicated that rDEN4-5097 had a ts, sp,
   and att phenotype while rDEN4-3303, rDEN4-4812, and rDEN4-7182 had no discernible
   phenotypes, indicating that the mutation at nt 5097 was responsible for the phenotype
   observed in the 5-FU parent, #1189. Thus, analysis of the relative contributions of the four
30 mutations present in the 5-FU mutant #1189 to its attenuation phenotype provides the
   framework for a similar analysis of the remaining 5-FU mutant viruses. This analysis
   specifically demonstrates the methods used to identify mutations contributing to the
                                                -38-

   observed phenotype. The ts, sp, and att phenotypes of 5-FU parent viruses #738, 922,
   1081, and 1083, were similarly attributed to single mutations 3540, 4306, 2650, and 10634,
   respectively.    However, two separate mutations (3771 and 4891) contributed to the
   phenotypes of 5-FU mutant virus #1136.
 5          Table 14 lists the genetic basis of the ts and mouse brain attenuation for the ten 5
   FU mutant viruses with ts phenotypes in both Vero and HuH-7 cells. As described in
   Example 1, the 4995 mutation which is the only mutation present in three 5-FU mutant
   viruses, #239, #489, and #773, was found to confer a ts and att phenotype, confirming the
   genetic basis for the phenotypes exhibited by these viruses. In three separate experiments,
10 the rDEN4-4995 virus was found to have an approximately 1,000-fold decrease in
   replication in the brains of suckling mice when compared to that of wild-type virus (Table 6
   and 14). The 4995 mutation is also present in 5-FU mutant viruses #473, #759, and #816,
   each of which has additional mutations. The ts and att phenotypes observed in these
   viruses can be attributed to the 4995 mutation since the additional mutations did not show
15 discernible phenotypes. Interestingly, 5-FU mutant virus #938 has the 4995 mutation and
   an additional mutation at nt 3442 in NS1 with both mutations independently conferring
   restricted replication in mouse brain. The remaining three 5-FU parent viruses in Table 14,
   #173, #509, and # 1033, were found to each contain a single mutation responsible for the att
   phenotype: 7849, 8092, and 4907, respectively.
20          Three 5-FU mutant viruses, #686, #992, and #1175 with HuH-7 cell-specific ts
   phenotypes are listed in Table 15. Mutations in NS3 (5695) and NS5 (10186) were found
   to confer the phenotypes observed for parent virus #992 and #1175.         Interestingly, two
   mutations in NS2A, 3575 and 4062, were found to result in a synergistic increase in the
   level of attenuation. Both individual mutations had an approximately 100-fold decrease in
25 virus replication in the brain while the parent virus with both mutations had an almost
    10,000-fold reduction. Table 16 lists two additional mutations with an att phenotype, 4896
   and 6259 in NS3.
            Replication of DEN4 viruses in SCID mice transplanted with HuH-7 cells.
   Since DEN viruses replicate poorly in the liver of mice and corresponding studies are
30 impractical to conduct in non-human primates, an animal model that evaluates the in vivo
   level of replication of DEN virus in liver cells was developed based on a recent report
   examining the replication of DEN virus in SCID mice transplanted with a continuous cell
                                                  -39-

   line of human liver tumor cells (An, J. et al. 1999 Virology 263:70-7).           SCID mice
   transplanted with human continuous cell lines, primary cells, or organized tissues have
   similarly been used to study the replication of other viruses which lack a suitable small
   animal model (Mosier, D.E. 2000 Virology 271:215-9). In our study, SCID mice were
 5 transplanted with HuH-7 cells since DEN4 virus replicated efficiently in these cells in
   tissue culture and since these were the cells used to define the host-range phenotype. These
   studies are envisioned as addressing the utility of examining DEN virus infection in SCID
   mouse-xenograft models for vaccine development (An, J. et al. 1999 Virology 263:70-7;
   Lin, Y.L. et al. 1998 J Virol 72:9729-37).
10         To further examine the in vivo growth properties of the 19 5-FU mutant DEN4
   viruses with mutations in only the NS genes and/or the 3' UTR and selected corresponding
   rDEN4 mutant viruses, replication was assessed in SCID mice transplanted with HuH-7
   cells (SCID-HuH-7). For analysis of DEN4 virus replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice, four to
   six week-old SCID mice (Tac:Icr:Ha(ICR)-Prkdcscid)(Taconic Farms) were injected
15 intraperitoneally with 107 HuH-7 cells suspended in 200 pl phosphate-buffered saline
   (PBS). In preparation for transplantation, HuH-7 cells were propagated in cell culture as
   described above and harvested by trypsinization at approximately 80% confluence. Cells
   were washed twice in PBS, counted, resuspended in an appropriate volume of PBS, and
   injected into the peritoneum of mice. Tumors were detected in the peritoneum five to six
20 weeks after transplantation, and only mice with apparent tumors were used for inoculation.
   Mice were infected by direct inoculation into the tumor with 104 PFU of virus in 50 pl
   Opti-MEM I. Mice were monitored daily for seven days and serum for virus titration was
   obtained by tail-nicking on day 6 and 7. Approximately 400 R1 blood was collected in a
   serum separator tube (Sarstedt, Germany), centrifuged, and serum was aliquoted and stored
25 at -70'C. The virus titer was determined by plaque assay in Vero cells. Seven days after
   infection, most mice developed morbidity and all mice were sacrificed.          Tumors were
   excised and weighed to confirm uniformity of the experimental groups.
           Preliminary experiments indicated that SCID-HuH-7 mice inoculated with DEN4
   2A-13 directly into the tumor developed viremia with maximum levels (up to 8.0
30 log,,PFU/ml serum) achieved on day 5 (Table 17). Virus could also be detected in brain,
   liver, and tumor homogenates.
                                                 -40-

           The level of viremia in SCID-HuH-7 mice infected with parental 5-FU or rDEN4
   mutant viruses was compared with that of the parallel-passaged control virus, 2A-13, or
   rDEN4, respectively.       Results of 4 separate experiments indicated that the vaccine
   candidate, rDEN4A30, had an almost 10-fold reduction in virus replication compared to
 5 wild type rDEN4 (Table 13) which reflects the apparent attenuation of the rDEN4A30
   vaccine candidate in humans (Example 8). Results in Tables 13 to 15 indicate that three 5
   FU mutant viruses had a greater than 100-fold reduction in viremia in the SCID-HuH-7
   mice compared to wild type 2A-13 virus: #1081, #1083, and #1189.               The common
   phenotype among these viruses was a sp phenotype in HuI-7 cells. Analysis of the genetic
10 basis of the att phenotype in these parent 5-FU mutant viruses identified three individual
   mutations in NS1, NS3, and the 3' UTR which conferred at least a 100-fold reduction in
   viremia.    Specifically, rDEN4-2650 (NS1), rDEN4-5097 (NS3), and rDEN4-10634 (3'
   UTR) manifested a 2.2, 3.6, and 4.3 logOPFU/ml reduction in peak titer of viremia
   compared to rDEN4, respectively. These mutations also conferred the att phenotype in
15 suckling mouse brain. 5-FU mutant virus #738 and #509 had a reduction in viremia in the
   SCID-HuII-7 mice compared to wild type 2A-13 of 1.9 and 1.5 logiOPFU/ml, respectively,
   and the genetic basis for these phenotypes is envisioned as being assessed on an empirical
   basis.
            This analysis of the genetic basis of the phenotypes specified by the mutations in
20 the 5-FU mutant viruses that manifested restricted replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice
   indicated that (1) three separate mutations conferred the att phenotype; (2) these mutations
   were located in two proteins, NS1 and NS3, and in the 3' UTR; (3) these three mutations
   were fully responsible for each of the cell culture (ts or sp) and in vivo (attenuation in
   mouse brain and SCID-HuH-7 mice) phenotypes of the parent viruses; and (4) two of the
25  three mutations specify the host-range sp phenotype (sp on HuH-7 only) and therefore are
    envisioned as being useful in a vaccine virus.      Although the relevance of such SCID
    transplant models to virus replication and disease in humans is unknown, the identification
    of three novel mutations which restrict DEN4 virus replication in SCID-HuII-7 mice is
    envisioned as facilitating an examination of the correlation between the att phenotype in
30  SCID-HuII-7 mice with that in rhesus monkeys or humans. Such mutations, specifically
    the host-range sp mutations, are envisioned as being useful in conjunction with the A30 or
    other mutation to decrease the residual virulence of rDEN4A30 or other dengue virus for
                                                -41-

   the human liver, and studies are envisioned as being conducted to construct such rDEN4
   viruses and evaluate them in monkeys and humans (Example 8).
            Combination of two 5-FU mutations results in an additive ts phenotype. The
   ability to combine individual mutations in rDEN4 virus as a means to modulate the
 5 phenotype of the resulting double mutant virus is a major advantage of using recombinant
   cDNA technology to generate or modify dengue virus vaccine candidates.             Addition of
   multiple ts and att mutations to recombinant vaccine viruses is envisioned as improving the
   phenotypic stability of the double recombinant due to the decreased possibility of co
   reversion of the two mutations to wild-type virulence (Crowe, J.E.Jr. et al. 1994a Vaccine
10 12:783-790; Skiadopoulos, M.H. et al. 1998 J Virol 72:1762-8; Subbarao, E.K. et al. 1995
   J Virol 69:5969-5977; Whitehead, S.S. et al. 1999 J Virol 73:871-7).            The mutations
   identified at nt position 4995 in NS3 and 7849 in NS5 were combined in a single p4 cDNA
   clone and a recombinant virus, designated rDEN4-4995-7849, was recovered and evaluated
   for its ts and att phenotypes (Table 18).         rDEN4-4995-7849 was more ts than either
15 recombinant virus containing the individual mutations (Table 18), indicating the additive
   effect of the two ts mutations. The rDEN4-4995-7849 virus had a greater than 10,000-fold
   reduction in replication in the brains of suckling mice. The reduction in replication of the
   double mutant virus was only slightly increased over that of rDEN4-7849, however, a
   difference in the level of replication between rDEN4-4995-7849 and rDEN4-7849 would be
20 difficult to detect since the level of replication of both viruses was close to the lower limit
   of detection (2.0 log 1 PFU/g brain).
            Combination of selected 5-FU mutations with the A30 mutation confers
   increased attenuation of rDEN4A30 for the brains of suckling mice. To define the
   effect of adding individual mutations to the attenuated rDEN4A30 background, five
25 combinations have been constructed: rDEN4A30-2650, rDEN4A30-4995, rDEN4A30-5097,
   rDEN4A30-8092, and rDEN4A30-10634.               Addition of such missense mutations with
   various ts, sp, and att phenotypes is envisioned as serving to decrease the reactogenicity of
   rDEN4A30 while maintaining sufficient immunogenicity.
            The A30 mutation was introduced into the 3' UTR of the individual mutant cDNA
30 clones by replacing the MluI - KpnI fragment with that derived from the p4A30 cDNA
   clone, and the presence of the deletion was confirmed by sequence analysis. Recombinant
   viruses were recovered by transfection in C6/36 cells for each rDEN4 virus. However,
                                                  -42-

   upon terminal dilution and passage, the rDEN4A30-5097 virus was found to not grow to a
   sufficient titer in Vero cells and was not pursued further. This is an example of a cDNA in
   which the 5-FU mutation and the A30 mutation are not compatible for efficient replication
   in cell culture. To begin the process of evaluating the in vivo phenotypes of the other four
 5 viruses which replicated efficiently in cell culture, rDEN4 viruses containing the individual
   mutations and the corresponding rDEN4A30 combinations were tested together for levels
   of replication in suckling mouse brain. The results in Table 19 indicate that addition of
   each of the mutations confers an increased level of attenuation in growth upon the
   rDEN4A30 virus, similar to the level conferred by the individual 5-FU mutation.           No
10 synergistic effect in attenuation was observed between the missense mutations and A30.
   These results indicate that the missense mutations at nucleotides 2650, 4995, 8092, and
   10634 are compatible with A30 for growth in cell culture and in vivo and can further
   attenuate the rDEN4A30 virus in mouse brain.           Further studies in SCID-HuH-7 mice,
   rhesus monkeys, and humans are envisioned as establishing the effect of the combination of
15 individual mutations and A30 upon attenuation and immunogenicity (Example 8).
           By identifying the specific mutations in the 5-FU mutant viruses which confer the
   observed phenotypes, a menu of defined ts, sp, and att mutations is envisioned as being
   assembled (see Example 7). Numerous combinations of two or more of these mutations are
   envisioned as being selected with or without the A30 mutation. Such mutations and their
20 combinations are envisioned as being useful for the construction of recombinant viruses
   with various levels of in vivo attenuation, thus facilitating the generation of candidate
   vaccines with acceptable levels of attenuation, immunogenicity, and genetic stability.
                                             Example 4
        Generation of DEN4 Mutant Viruses with Temperature-Sensitive and Mouse
25         Attenuation Phenotypes Through Charge-Cluster-to-Alanine Mutagenesis
           The previous Examples described the creation of a panel of DEN4 mutant viruses
   with ts, sp, and att phenotypes obtained through 5-FU mutagenesis. As indicated in these
   Examples, the attenuating mutations identified in the 5-FU mutant viruses are envisioned as
   having several uses including (1) fine tuning the level of attenuation of existing dengue
30 virus vaccine candidates and (2) generation of new vaccine candidates by combination of
   two or more of these attenuating mutations. In the current example, we created a second
   panel of mutant viruses through charge-cluster-to-alanine mutagenesis of the NS5 gene of
                                                 -43-

   DEN4 and examined the resulting mutant viruses for the ts, sp, and att phenotypes as
   described in Examples 1 and 2.         The charge-cluster-to-alanine mutant viruses recovered
   demonstrated a range of phenotypes including ts in Vero cells alone, ts in HuH-7 cells
   alone, ts in both cell types, att in suckling mouse brains, and att in SCID-HuH-7 mice.
 5          The usefulness of mutant viruses expressing these phenotypes has already been
   described, however charge-cluster-to-alanine mutant viruses possess some additional
   desirable characteristics. First, the relevant mutations are envisioned as being designed for
   use in the genes encoding the non-structural proteins of DEN4, and therefore are envisioned
   as being useful to attenuate DEN1, DEN2, and DEN3 antigenic chimeric recombinants
10 possessing a DEN4 vector background. Second, the phenotype is usually specified by three
   or more nucleotide changes, rendering the likelihood of reversion of the mutant sequence to
   that of the wild type sequence less than for a single point mutation, such as mutations
   identified in the panel of 5-FU mutant viruses.              Finally, charge-cluster-to-alanine
   attenuating mutations are envisioned as being easily combinable among themselves or with
15 other attenuating mutations to modify the attenuation phenotype of DEN4 vaccine
   candidates or of DEN1, DEN2, and DEN3 antigenic chimeric recombinant viruses
   possessing a DEN4 vector background.
            Charge-Cluster-to-Alanine-Mutagenesis.             The    cDNA     p4,  from    which
   recombinant wild type and mutant viruses were generated, has been described in Examples
20  1, 2, and 3 and in Figure 4. Charge-cluster-to-alanine mutagenesis (Muylaert, I.R. et al.
    1997 J Virol 71:291-8), in which pairs of charged amino acids are replaced with alanine
   residues, was used to individually mutagenize the coding sequence for 80 pairs of
   contiguous charged amino acids in the DEN4 NS5 gene.                    Subclones suitable for
   mutagenesis were derived from the full length DEN4 plasmid (p4) by digestion with
25 Xmal/PstI (pNS5A), PstI/Sacll (pNS5B) or SacII/MluI (pNS5C) at the nucleotide positions
   indicated in Figure 4. These fragments were then subcloned and Kunkel mutagenesis was
   conducted as described in Examples 1 and 3. To create each mutation, oligonucleotides
   were designed to change the sequence of individual pairs of codons to GCAGCX (SEQ ID
   NO: 69), thereby replacing them with two alanine codons (GCX) and also creating a BbvI
30 restriction site (GCAGC) (SEQ ID NO: 70). The BbvI site was added to facilitate screening
   of cDNAs and recombinant viruses for the presence of the mutant sequence. Restriction
                                                  -44-

   enzyme fragments bearing the alanine mutations were cloned back into the full-length p4
   plasmid as described in Examples 1 and 3.
           Initial evaluation of the phenotype of the 32 charge-cluster-to-alanine mutant
   viruses revealed a range in restriction of replication in suckling mouse brain and SCID
 5 HuH-7 mice.        To determine whether attenuation could be enhanced by combining
   mutations, double mutant viruses carrying two pairs of charge-cluster-to-alanine mutations
   were created by swapping appropriate fragments carrying one pair of mutations into a
   previously-mutagenized p4 cDNA carrying a second pair of mutations in a different
   fragment using conventional cloning techniques.
10         Transcription and Transfection. 5'-capped transcripts were synthesized in vitro
   from mutagenized cDNA templates using AmpliCap SP6 RNA polymerase (Epicentre,
   Madison, WI).       Transfection mixtures, consisting of 1 ptg of transcript in 60 pl of
   HEPES/saline plus 12 pl of dioleoyl trimethylammoniun propane (DOTAP) (Roche
   Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN), were added, along with 1 ml Virus production-serum
15 free medium (VP-SFM) to subconfluent monolayers of Vero cells in 6-well plates.
   Transfected monolayers were incubated at 35'C for approximately 18 hr, cell culture
   medium was removed and replaced with 2 ml VP-SFM, and cell monolayers were
   incubated at 35'C. After 5 to 6 days, cell culture medium was collected, and the presence
   of virus was determined by titration in Vero cells followed by immunoperoxidase staining
20 as previously described. Recovered virus was amplified by an additional passage in Vero
   cells, and virus suspensions were combined with SPG (sncrose--phosphate--glutamate)
   stabilizer (final concentration: 218 mM sucrose, 6 mM L-glutamic acid, 3.8 mM potassium
   phosphate, monobasic, and 7.2 mM potassium phosphate, dibasic, pH 7.2), aliquoted,
    frozen on dry ice, and stored at -70'C.
25          cDNA constructs not yielding virus after transfection of Vero cells were used to
    transfect C6/36 cells as follows. Transfection mixtures, as described above, were added,
    along with 1 ml of MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 2
    mM non-essential amino acids, and 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin, to monolayers of C6/36 cells.
    Transfected cell monolayers were incubated at 32'C for 18 hr, cell culture medium was
30  removed and replaced with 2 ml fresh medium, and cell monolayers were incubated at
    32'C. After 5 to 6 days, cell culture media were then used to infect Vero cells and
                                                -45-

   incubated for 5-6 days, at which time cell culture media were collected, frozen and titered
   as described above.
           Recovered viruses were biologically cloned by two rounds of terminal dilution in
   Vero cells followed by an additional amplification in Vero cells. Briefly, virus was initially
 5 diluted to a concentration of approximately 20 PFU/ml in VP-SFM and then subjected to a
   series of two-fold dilutions across a 96-well plate. Virus dilutions were used to infect Vero
   cell monolayers in a 96-well plate and incubated for 5 to 6 days at 35'C. Following
   incubation, cell culture media were removed and temporarily stored at 4*C, and the virus
   positive cell monolayers were identified by immunoperoxidase staining. Terminal dilution
10 was achieved when 5 25% of cell monolayers were positive for virus. Cell culture medium
   from a positive monolayer at the terminal dilution was subjected to an additional round of
   terminal dilution. Following the second terminal dilution, virus was amplified in Vero cells
   (75 cm2 flask), collected and frozen as previously described.
           Assays for temperature-sensitivity and mouse attenuation. Assay of the level of
15 temperature sensitivity of the charge-cluster-to-alanine mutant viruses in Vero and HuH-7
   cells and their level of replication in the brain of suckling mice were conducted as described
   in Example 1 and assay of the level of replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice was conducted as
   described in Example 3.
           Charge-cluster-to-alanine mutant viruses are viable and show temperature
20 sensitive and mouse attenuation phenotypes. Of 80 full-length DEN4 cDNA constructs
   containing a single pair of charge-to-alanine mutations, virus was recovered from 32 in
   either Vero or C6/36 cells (Figure 5). The level of temperature sensitivity of wt rDEN4,
   rDEN4A30, and the 32 mutant viruses is summarized in Table 20. One mutant virus (645
   646) was ts in Vero but not HuH-7 cells and 7 mutant viruses were ts in HuH-7 but not
25 Vero cells. Such mutants whose temperature sensitivity is host-cell dependent are referred
   to as temperature-sensitive, host-range (tshr) mutants. Thirteen mutant viruses were ts in
   both cell types, and 11 mutant viruses were not ts on either cell type. Thus a total of 21
   mutant viruses were ts with 8 mutant viruses exhibiting an tshr specificity. None of the
   mutant viruses showed a small plaque phenotype at permissive temperature.              Mutant
30 viruses showed a wide range (0 to 10,000-fold) of restricted replication in suckling mouse
   brain (Table 20).     Fourteen mutant viruses were attenuated in suckling mouse brain,
   arbitrarily defined as a > 1.5 log 1 --unit reduction in virus titer. There was no correlation
                                                   -46-

   between attenuation in mouse brain and temperature sensitivity in either Vero cells
   (Kendall Rank correlation: P = 0.77) or HuH-7 cells (Kendall Rank correlation: P = 0.06).
           Thirteen mutant viruses that either showed an att phenotype in suckling mouse
   brain or whose unmutated charged amino acid pair was highly conserved among the four
 5 DEN serotypes (see Example 7) were assayed for att in SCID-HuH-7 mice (Table 21).
   Three of these mutant viruses showed >100-fold decrease in replication relative to wild
   type DEN4. Overall, mean log reduction from wild type in suckling mice did not show
   significant correlation with mean log reduction in SCID-HuH-7 mice (Spearman rank
   correlation, N = 13, P = 0.06).     However, mutant virus 200-201 was unusual in that it
10 showed a high level of restriction in SCID-HuH-7 mice but little restriction in suckling
   mouse brain. When virus 200-201 was removed from the analysis, restriction of replication
   in suckling and SCID-HuH-7 mice showed a significant correlation (Spearman rank
   correlation, N = 12, P = 0.02).
           Combining charge-cluster-to-alanine mutations present in two viruses into one
15 virus can enhance its ts and att phenotypes.        Six paired mutations were combined into
   fourteen double-pair mutant viruses, of which six could be recovered in Vero or C6/36 cells
   (Table 22). All of the individual paired mutations used in double-pair mutant viruses were
   ts on HuH-7 cells, none was ts in Vero cells, and for all combinations at least one mutation
   pair conferred an att phenotype in suckling mouse brain. Evaluation of four of the double
20 pair mutant viruses (Table 23) revealed that combining charge-cluster-to-alanine mutation
   pairs invariably resulted in the acquisition of a ts phenotype in Vero cells (4 out of 4
   viruses) and often resulted in a lowered shutoff temperature in HuH-7 cells (3 out of 4
   viruses). In half of the viruses assayed, combination of charge-cluster-to-alanine mutation
   pairs resulted in enhanced restriction of replication (10-fold greater than either component
25 mutation) in suckling mouse brain (Table 23) and in SCID-HuH-7 mice (Table 24).
           Summary. The major usefulness of the charge-cluster-to-alanine mutations stems
   from their design: they are located in the DEN4 non-structural gene region and therefore
   are envisioned as being useful to attenuate DEN4 itself as well as antigenic chimeric
   viruses possessing the DEN4 NS gene region. Furthermore, they are predicted to be
30 phenotypically more stable than the single-nucleotide substitution mutant viruses such as
   the 5-FU mutant viruses.      Finally, combinations of mutations are envisioned as being
   created in order to fine-tune attenuation and to further stabilize attenuation phenotypes.

          Identification and Characterization of DEN4 Mutant Viruses Restricted in
                                    Replication in Mosquitoes
   SECTION 1. Identification of viruses showing restriction of replication in mosquitoes.
 5         In Examples 1 and 4, DEN4 mutant viruses were generated through 5-FU
   mutagenesis and charge-cluster-to-alanine mutagenesis, respectively, in order to identify
   mutations that confer ts, sp and att phenotypes. Another highly desirable phenotype of a
   dengue virus vaccine is restricted growth in the mosquito host. A dengue virus vaccine
   candidate should not be transmissible from humans to mosquitoes in order to prevent both
10 the introduction of a dengue virus into an environment in which it is currently not endemic
   and to prevent the possible loss of the attenuation phenotype during prolonged replication
   in an individual mosquito host.       Loss of the attenuation phenotype could also occur
   following sustained transmission between humans and mosquitoes.              Recently, loss of
   attenuation of a live attenuated poliovirus vaccine was seen following sustained
15 transmission among humans (CDC 2000 MMWR 49:1094).
           In the present example, a panel of 1248 DEN4 mutant viruses generated through 5
   FU mutagenesis and 32 DEN4 mutant viruses generated through charge-cluster-to-alanine
   mutagenesis were assayed for restricted growth in mosquito cells.             This is a useful
   preliminary assay for restriction in vivo, since restriction in cultured mosquito cells is often,
20 though not always, associated with poor infectivity for mosquitoes (Huang, C.Y. et al. 2000
   J Virol 74:3020-8).    Mutant viruses that showed restriction in mosquito cells and robust
   growth in Vero cells (the substrate for vaccine development, as discussed in Example 6)
   were targeted for further characterization.
           Generation and characterization of the 5-1A1 mutant.               The generation and
25 isolation of the panel of 1248 5-FU mutant viruses and the panel of 32 charge-cluster-to
   alanine mutant viruses have been described in Examples 1, 2, and 4. Vero and C6/36 cells
   were maintained as described in Example 1.
           Each of the 1248 5-FU mutant viruses and 32 charge-cluster-to-alanine mutant
   viruses was titered in C6/36 cell monolayers in 24-well plates at 32*C and 5% CO 2 . After 5
30 days, plaques were immunostained with anti-DEN4 rabbit polyclonal antibody and counted
   as described in the preceding Examples.        Mutant viruses were assayed for one of two
   phenotypes indicating restricted growth in mosquito cells: either sp in C6/36 cellsrelative
                                                 -48-

   to Vero cells or a > 3.5 log,, PFU/ml decrease in titer between Vero and C6/36 cells at the
   permissive temperature for each cell type. Two mutant viruses, one generated by 5-FU
   mutagenesis (#5) and one generated by charge-cluster-to-alanine mutagenesis (rDEN4
   356,357), showed reduced plaque size in C6/36 cells. After three terminal dilutions, the 5
 5 FU mutant #5, designated 5-lAl, maintained the reduced plaque size phenotype.
   Additionally, recombinant virus rDEN4-7546, tested for Vero cell adaptation (discussed in
   detail in Example 6) also showed reduced plaque size in C6/36 (Figure 10).
            The multicycle growth kinetics of both 5-lA1 and the recombinant wild type
   rDEN4 in C6/36 cells were determined as described in Example 1. Briefly, cells were
10 infected in triplicate at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 and samples were harvested at 24
   hr intervals.    Samples were flash frozen and titered in a single assay in Vero cell
   monolayers.
            Oral infection of mosquitoes.        Aedes aegypti is one of the primary vectors of
   dengue virus (Gubler, D.J. 1998 Clin MicrobiolRev 11:480-96). This species was reared at
15 26'C and 80% relative humidity (RH) with a 16 hr daylight cycle. Adults were allowed
   continuous access to a cotton pad soaked in a 10% sucrose solution. Five to ten day old
   female Ae. aegypti which had been deprived of a sugar source for 48 hr were fed a
   bloodmeal consisting of equal volumes of washed human red blood cells, 10% sucrose
    solution, and dengue virus suspension. The infected blood meal was prepared immediately
20 prior to feeding and offered to mosquitoes in a water-jacketed feeder covered in stretched
   parafilm and preheated to 38'C (Rutledge, L.C. et al. 1964 Mosquito News 24:407-419).
   Mosquitoes that took a full bloodmeal within 45 min were transferred to a new container by
    aspirator and maintained as described above. After 21 days, mosquitoes were stored at
    20'C until dissection.
25          Intrathoracic inoculation of mosquitoes.             The large, non-haematophagous
    mosquito Toxorhynchites splendens is a sensitive host for determining the infectivity of
    dengue virus. This species was reared at 24'C and 75% RH with a 12 hr daylight cycle.
    Larvae and pupae were fed on appropriately sized Aedes larvae; adults were allowed
    continuous access to a cotton pad soaked in a 10% sucrose solution. Groups of one to ten
30  day old adult T. splendens of both sexes were immobilized by immersion of their container
    in an icewater bath and inoculated intrathoracically with undiluted virus and serial tenfold
    dilutions of virus in IX PBS. Virus was inoculated in a 0.22 il dose using a Harvard
                                                   -49-

   Apparatus microinjector (Medical Systems Corp, Greenvale NY) and a calibrated glass
   needle (technique is a modification of the method described in Rosen and Gubler, 1974).
           Detection of viral antigen in body and head tissues by immunofluorescence
   assay (IFA). Head and midgut preparations of Aedes aegypti and head preparations of
 5 Toxorhynchites splendens were made on glass slides as described in Sumanochitrapon et al.
   (Sumanochitrapon, W. et al. 1998 Am J Trop Med Hyg 58:283-6). Slides were fixed in
   acetone for 20 min, and placed at 4'C until processed by IFA. The primary antibody,
   hyperimmune mouse ascites fluid specific for DEN-4 (HMAF), was diluted 1/100 in PBS
   Tween 20 (0.05%). Slides were incubated at 37'C in a humid chamber for 30 min, and
10 subsequently rinsed in PBS-Tween 20. The secondary antibody, FITC conjugated goat
   anti-mouse IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), was diluted 1/200 in PBS-Tween 20 with
   0.002% Evan's Blue.       Slides were viewed on an Olympus BX60 microscope.           The
   infectious dose required to infect 50% of mosquitoes (IDo) was determined by the method
   of Reed and Muench (Reed, L.J. & Muench, H. 1938 Am J Hyg 27:493-497). For Aedes
15 aegypti infections, two OID 50 (oral infectious dose 50) values were calculated for each
   virus: the OID50 required to produce an infection in the midgut, with or without
   dissemination to the head, and the OID50 required to produce disseminated infection. For
   Tx. splendens one MID 50 (mosquito infectious dose 50) value was calculated.
           Statistical Analysis.   The percentage of mosquitoes infected by different viruses
20 were compared using logistic regression analysis (Statview, Abacus Inc.).
           Mutations restricting growth of DEN4 in mosquito cells but not Vero cells are
   rare. Out of 1280 mutant viruses initially assayed, only two, #5 and rDEN4-356,357,
   showed reduced plaque size in C6/36 cells and normal plaque size in Vero cells. One
   additional virus, rDEN4-7546 (described in Example 6), with reduced plaque size in C6/36
25 was detected in subsequent assays.       Mutant virus #5 was cloned by three successive
   terminal dilutions and designated 5-lAl; rDEN4-7546 and rDEN4-356,357 had already
   been twice-terminally diluted when they were tested in C6/36 cells. Virus 5-1A1 has been
   extensively characterized and its phenotypes are described in detail in the following
   section. rDEN4-356,357      and rDEN4-7546 are envisioned as being characterized in a
30 similar fashion.

   small plaque size (Figure 6, Table 25).             In comparison, wild type DEN4 used as a
   concurrent control replicated to 7.3 logiPFU/ml in Vero cells, 8.3 log1 0PFU/ml in C6/36
   cells, and showed normal plaque size in both cell types (Figure 6, Table 25). The growth
   kinetics of 5-lA1 was compared to that of wild type DEN4 by infecting C6/36 cells at an
 5 MOI of 0.01 and monitoring the production of infectious virus.                  The kinetics and
   magnitude of replication of 5-lAl in C6/36 cells was comparable to that of wild type
   DEN4 (Figure 7).
            5-1A1 is restricted in its ability to infect mosquitoes. 5-lA1 was evaluated for its
   ability to infect Aedes aegypti mosquitoes through an artificial bloodmeal (Table 26). In
10 this assay the ability to infect the midgut of the mosquito and the ability for a midgut
   infection to disseminate to the head are measured separately. The oral infectious dose 50
   (OID5 0) of wild type DEN4 for the midgut was 3.3 logio PFU; the         OID50 of wild type DEN4
   for a disseminated infection was 3.9 logic0 PFU. In contrast, 5-lAl never infected 50% of
   mosquitoes at the doses used. In order to calculate the OID5 . for midgut infections by 5
15 lAl, it was assumed that at a 10-fold higher dose, 100% of 25 mosquitoes would have
   become infected. Using this assumption, the conservative estimate of the OID5 0 for midgut
   infections by 5-lA1 was ;> 3.9 logiOPFU.          Because 5-lA1 produced only 3 disseminated
   infections, we did not attempt to calculate an OID50 for this category.                5-lA1 was
   significantly restricted in its ability to infect the midgut relative to wild type DEN4 (logistic
20 regression, N = 150, P < 0.001).         Additionally, 5-lA1 produced very few disseminated
   infections, but because of low numbers this result was not amenable to statistical analysis.
            5-1A1 was also significantly restricted in its ability to infect Tx. splendens
   mosquitoes following intrathoracic inoculation (Table 27). The MID5 0 of wild type DEN4
   was 2.3 log,0 PFU whereas the MID5 0 of 5-1A1 was estimated to be > 3.0 log 0 PFU
25 (logistic regression, N = 36, P < 0.01).
            5-1A1 does not show a ts or an att phenotype. 5-lA1 was tested for temperature
   sensitivity in Vero and HuH-7 cells and for attenuation in suckling mouse brains as
   described in Example 1. The mutant virus was not temperature sensitive, as defined in
   Example 1, and was not attenuated in suckling mouse brain (Table 25).
30          Identification and confirmation of the mutation responsible for the phenotype
   of 5-1A1.    The nucleotide sequence of the entire genome of 5-lA1 was determined as
   described in Example 1. Sequencing of 5-lA1 revealed three changes from the wild type
                                                    -51-

   sequence: two translationally-silent point mutations at positions 7359 and 9047, and one
   coding point mutation (C to U) at position 7129 in the NS4B gene which resulted in a
   proline to leucine substitution.
           To formally confirm the effect of the C7129U mutation, the mutation was inserted
 5 into the cDNA p4, which has been described in Examples 1, 2, and 3 and in Figure 4, using
   Kunkel mutagenesis as described in Examples 1 and 3.           The mutagenized cDNA was
   transcribed and transfected as described in Example 3, and the resulting virus, after two
   terminal dilutions, was designated rDEN4-7129-1A. Like 5-lAl, rDEN4-7129-1A showed
   normal plaque size and titer in Vero cells and reduced plaque size and normal titer in C6/36
10 cells (Table 25). rDEN4-7129-1A was not ts on either Vero or HuH-7 cells and was not att
   in suckling mouse brain. Additionally, rDEN4-7129-lA did not show the SCID-HuH-7 att
   phenotype described in Example 3 (Table 25). The ability of rDEN4-7129-1A to infect
   mosquitoes is envisioned as being tested in both Ae. aegypti and Tx. splendens.
           To test the compatibility of the C7129U mutation and the A30 deletion, the C7129U
15 mutation was inserted into rDEN4A30 using previously described techniques.               The
   resulting virus, designated rDEN4A30-7129, is envisioned as being tested for the
   phenotypes listed in Table 25.
           In summary, three mutant viruses, 5-lAl, rDEN4-356,357 and rDEN4-7546,
   showed a particular combination of phenotypes characterized by normal plaque size and
20 replication to high titers in Vero cells and small plaque size but unrestricted growth in
   mosquito cells.    5-lA1 was further characterized and lacked temperature sensitivity in
   either Vero or HuH-7 cells and showed normal levels of replication in mouse brain and in
   SCID-HuH-7 mice and restricted infectivity for both Ae. aegypti and Tx. splendens
   mosquitoes.     In comparison to wild type rDEN4, the 5-lA1 mutant had one coding
25 mutation: a point mutation (C to U) at nucleotide 7129 in NS4B resulting in a replacement
   of Pro with Leu. Because 5-1Al contains only a single missense mutation, the phenotype
   of this mutant virus can be attributed to the effect of the mutation at position 7129. These
   results indicate that the 7129 mutation is responsible for the phenotype of decreased
   infectivity for mosquitoes and is predicted to be useful to restrict replication of vaccine
30 candidates in mosquitoes.     To formally confirm this, we have inserted the 7129 mutation
   into a recombinant DEN4 virus. The resulting virus, designated rDEN4-7129-lA, shows
                                                -52-

   an absence of ts and att phenotypes similar to 5-1A1. It is envisioned as being tested for
   mosquito infectivity.
            The 7129 mutation is a valuable point mutation to include in a DEN4 vaccine
   candidate and into each of the dengue virus antigenic chimeric vaccine candidates since its
 5 biological activity is host specific, i.e., it is restricted in replication in mosquitoes but not in
   mammals. Moreover, as discussed in Example 6, the 7129 mutation has also been shown
   to enhance replication in Vero cells.           Thus, its insertion into a vaccine candidate is
   envisioned as enhancing vaccine production in tissue culture without affecting the
   biological properties specified by other attenuating mutations.             It is also envisioned as
10 providing a useful safeguard against mosquito transmission of a dengue virus vaccine.
   SECTION II. Design of mutations to restrict replication in mosquitoes
            In Section 1 of Example 5, we screened a large panel of mutant viruses carrying
   both random mutations (generated with 5-fluorouracil) and specific mutations (generated
   through charge-cluster-to-alanine mutagenesis) for restricted growth in C6/36 cells, a proxy
15 measure for restriction in mosquitoes. However, in neither case were mutations designed
   for the specific purpose of restricting replication in mosquitoes.               In this section, we
   identified nucleotide sequences in the 3' UTR that show conserved differences between the
   mosquito-transmitted and tick-transmitted flaviviruses. We then altered those sequences in
   the DEN4 cDNA p4 by either deleting them altogether or exchanging them with the
20 homologous sequence of the tick-transmitted Langat virus. The resulting viruses were
   assayed for reduced plaque size and titer in both Vero and C6/36 cells and for infectivity
   for Ae. aegypti and Tx. splendens.
            Identification and modification of particular 3' UTR sequences showing
   conserved differences between vectors.             Several studies (Olsthoorn, R.C. & Bol, J.F.
25 2001 RNA 7:1370-7; Proutski, V. et al. 1997 Nucleic Acids Res 25:1194-202) have
   identified conserved differences in the nucleotide sequences of the 3' UTR of mosquito
   transmitted and tick-transmitted flaviviruses. Such differences are concentrated in the 3'
   terminal core region, the approximately 400 3' terminal nucleotides. It has been suggested
   that these sequences may have a vector-specific function (Proutski, V. et al. 1997 Nucleic
30 Acids Res 25:1194-202). While such a function has not been identified, it may nonetheless
   be possible to disrupt vector infectivity by deleting or otherwise altering these nucleotides.
                                                     -53-

           To identify target sequences for this type of alteration, we constructed an alignment
   of the 3' UTR nucleotide sequences of seven mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses and four
   tick-transmitted flaviviruses (Figure 8).       From this alignment, we identified several
   sequences     that  showed     conserved   differences   between the mosquito-transmitted
 5 flaviviruses and tick-transmitted flaviviruses.     We then designed primers to alter these
   sequences in the wt DEN4 cDNA p4 (Figure 4) in one of two ways: 1) deletion of the
   nucleotides (A) or 2) replacement of the nucleotides with the homologous sequence from
   the tick-transmitted flavivirus Langat (swap).       Langat was chosen as the template for
   swapped nucleotides because it is naturally attenuated (Pletnev, A.G. 2001 Virology
10 282:288-300), and therefore unlikely to enhance the virulence of rDEN4 virus derived from
   the modified cDNA. The DEN4 sequences altered and the mutagenesis primers used to do
   so are listed in Table 28.         Nucleotides 10508-10530 correspond to the CS2 region
   identified in previous studies (Proutski, V. et al. 1997 Nucleic Acids Res 25:1194-202).
           Mutagenesis of p4, transcription and transfection were conducted as previously
15 described in Section I of this Example. All five of the engineered viruses were recovered,
   and all were subjected to two rounds of terminal dilution as previously described.
            Evaluation of phenotypes: cell culture. Viruses were titered in Vero and C6/36
   cells as previously described, and the results are listed in Table 29. All of the viruses
   replicated to >5.0 log,, PFU/ml; one of them (rDEN4A10508-10530) replicated to > 8.0
20 log,, PFU/ml. Only one of the viruses (rDEN4A10535-10544) was small plaque in C6/36
   cells; this virus showed wild-type plaque size in Vero cells. Interestingly, another virus
   (rDEN4swap1O508-10539) showed wild type plaque size in C6/36 cells but was sp in Vero
   cells.
            Evaluation of phenotypes: mosquito infectivity. To date one of the five viruses
25 has been tested for infectivity via intrathoracic inoculation in Tx. splendens, using
   previously described methods. Virus rDEN4A10508-10530 was dramatically restricted in
   infectivity relative to the wild type (Table 30). So few mosquitoes were infected that it was
   not possible to calculate an MID5 for this virus.
            One of the five viruses has been tested for infectivity of Ae. aegypti fed on an
30 infectious bloodmeal using previously described methods. rDEN4swap10535-10544 (Table
   31) caused significantly fewer midgut infections than wild type rDEN4, but the percentage
   of disseminated infections did not differ between rDEN4swap10535-10544 and wild type
                                                  -54-

   rDEN4. All of the viruses are envisioned as being tested for mosquito infectivity using
   both methods.
           Summary. In this example we have outlined two different strategies for preventing
   mosquito transmission of a dengue vaccine. First, several small substitution mutations,
 5 including two point mutations and one paired charge-to-alanine substitution, have been
   shown to restrict the replication of DEN4 in mosquito C6/36 cells in cell culture, and one of
   these mutations (C7129U) has been shown to restrict the ability of DEN4 virus to infect
   mosquitoes. Second, we have created a variety of deletion and substitution mutations in
   regions of the DEN4 3' UTR that show conserved differences between mosquito
10 transmitted and tick-transmitted flaviviruses. One of these viruses is sp in C6/36 cells and
   at least two of these viruses show some degree of restriction of mosquito infectivity. By
   design, the nucleotide sequences in which these mutations were made are highly conserved
   among the four dengue serotypes and among mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses in general,
   indicating that they are portable to other vaccine candidates for mosquito-borne
15 flaviviruses. All of the mutations discussed in this Example lie outside the structural genes
   and so are envisioned as being useful in constructing antigenic-chimeric vaccine
   candidates.
                                             Example 6
    Adaptation Mutations Which Enhance the Replication of DEN4 and DEN4 Chimeric
20                                     Viruses in Vero Cells.
           Vero cells are a highly characterized substrate that should be suitable for the
   manufacture of live attenuated flavivirus vaccines, such as dengue virus and tick-borne
   encephalitis virus. In addition, Vero cells can also be used to grow flaviviruses to high titer
   for the preparation of an inactivated virus vaccine. Optimal sequences for the efficient
25 growth of dengue viruses in Vero cells have not been identified, but it is well known that
   flaviviruses accumulate mutations during passage in various cell cultures (Dunster, L.M. et
   al. 1999 Virology 261:309-18; Theiler, M. & Smith, H.H. 1937 J Exp Med 65:787-800).
   Inclusion of specific sequences in live attenuated viruses that enhance their replication in
   Vero cells and increase the number of doses of vaccine produced per unit substrate would
30 greatly facilitate their manufacture.   Similarly, inclusion of Vero cell growth-promoting
   sequences in wild type viruses used for the preparation of an inactivated virus vaccine
   would also greatly facilitate the manufacture of the vaccine. The present example identifies
                                                -55-

   mutations that occur following passage of DEN4 virus and DEN2/4 chimeric viruses in
   Vero cells. Data derived from five sources provided information for this analysis making it
   possible to generate a list of Vero cell growth-promoting sequences.
           Presence of identical mutations in multiple 5-FU mutant viruses.           First, as
 5 described in Examples 1 and 2, the genomes of 42 dengue virus clones isolated from a 5
   FU mutagenized stock of virus were completely sequenced.          If mutations that enhance
   replication occurred during the passage of these 42 mutant viruses in Vero cells, then such
   mutations should reveal themselves by representation in more than one clone. Analysis of
   the 42 sequences revealed the occurrence of specific missense mutations in coding regions
10 or nucleotide substitutions in UTRs in multiple clones that are not present in the 2A
   parental virus genome (Tables 11 and 32). These mutations, many of which occur within a
   400 nucleotide section of the NS4B coding region, represent Vero cell-adaptation
   mutations. One mutation, such as the 4995 mutation, present in eight viruses was found to
   specify both ts and att phenotypes (Examples 1 and 3). In contrast, the 7163 mutation,
15 present in six viruses, does not specify a ts or att phenotype (Table 13) and thus is an
   example of a specific Vero cell growth-promoting mutation.
            Presence of Vero cell adaptation mutations in other DEN4 viruses and DEN2/4
   antigenic chimeric viruses. Second, the 2A-13 dengue virus that was used as a parallel
   passaged wild type control during the 5-FU experiments described in Example 1 was grown
20 and cloned in Vero cells in the absence of 5-FU in a manner identical to that of the 5-FU
   treated viruses. Sequence analysis of this 5-FU untreated virus, designated 2A-13-1A1,
   revealed that the virus genome contained a mutation at nucleotide 7163 (Example 1 and
   Table 32), identical to the missense mutation previously identified in 6 of the 5-FU mutant
   viruses (Tables 11 and 32). This indicates that growth and passage of DEN4 virus in Vero
25 cells is sufficient to acquire this specific mutation, i.e. mutagenesis with 5-FU is not
   required. Thus, information from two separate sources indicates that the 7163 mutation
   appeared in separate Vero cell passaged viruses, thereby strengthening the interpretation
   that this mutation is growth promoting.
            Third, following passage of the 2AA30 and rDEN4A30 in Vero cells, sequence
30 analysis revealed the presence of a mutation at nucleotides 7153 and 7163, respectively.
   These two mutations were also previously identified among the 5-FU treated viruses (Table
   32). Again, identical mutations appeared following independent passage of virus in Vero
                                                 -56-

   cells, corroborating the hypothesis that these mutations confer a growth advantage in Vero
   cells.
           Fourth, an antigenic chimeric dengue virus vaccine candidate was generated that
   expressed the structural proteins C, prM, and E from DEN2 on a DEN4 wild type genetic
 5 background or an attenuated A30 genetic background. To construct this virus, the C, prM
   and E region of wild type cDNA plasmid p4 was replaced with a similar region from DEN2
   virus strain NGC (Figure 10). Specifically, nucleotides between restriction sites BglII (nt
   88) and XhoI (nt 2345) of p4 were replaced with those derived from dengue type 2 virus.
   RNA transcripts synthesized from the resulting p4-D2 plasmid were transfected into Vero
10 cells and rDEN2/4 virus was recovered. A further attenuated version of this chimeric virus
   containing the A30 mutation, rDEN2/4A30, was recovered in C6/36 mosquito cells
   following transfection of cells with RNA transcripts derived p4A30-D2.             However,
   rDEN2/4A30 could not be recovered directly in Vero cells. The rDEN2/4A30 mutant virus
   recovered in C6/36 cells replicated to very low levels in Vero cells (<1.0 log1 oPFU/ml) but
15 grew to high titer in C6/36 cells (>6.0 logioPFU/ml).     Genomic sequence of the C6/36
   derived virus matched the predicted cDNA sequence and is shown in Appendix 3.
   Nevertheless, when C6/36-derived rDEN2/4A30 was serially passaged 3 to 4 times in Vero
   cells, a virus population adapted for growth in Vero cells emerged. Virus from this Vero
   cell-adapted preparation was cloned and amplified in Vero cells to a titer >6.0 logjPFU/ml.
20 The genomic sequence was determined for 2 independent virus clones and compared to the
   predicted cDNA sequence (Table 33 and 34). Each cloned virus contains a mutation in a
   non-structural gene which coincides closely in location or sequence with a mutation
   previously identified among the panel of 5-FU mutagenized viruses. The other mutations
   in these two clones also might confer a growth advantage in Vero cells. Importantly, the
25 mutations identified in Tables 33 and 34 are absolutely required for replication in Vero
   cells, and it would not be possible to produce the rDEN2/4A30 vaccine candidate in Vero
   cells without the growth-promoting mutations identified in Tables 33 and 34.
           Fifth, sequence analysis of the dengue 4 wild-type virus strain 814669 (GenBank
   accession no. AF326573) following passage in Vero cells identified a mutation in the NS5
30 region at nucleotide 7630 which had previously been identified among the panel of 5-FU
   mutagenized viruses (Table 32). This mutation at nucleotide 7630 was introduced into
   recombinant virus rDEN4 by site-directed mutagenesis as described in Table 16.           The
                                                -57-

   resulting virus, rDEN4-7630, was not temperature sensitive when tested at 39'C, indicating
   that mutation 7630 does not contribute to temperature sensitivity.
            Characterization of rDEN2/4A30 chimeric viruses containing single and
   multiple Vero cell adaptation mutations. The generation of chimeric virus rDEN2/4A30
 5 provided a unique opportunity for evaluating the capacity of individual mutations to
   promote increased growth in Vero cells. Because rDEN2/4A30 replicates to very low titer
   in Vero cells, yet can be efficiently generated in C6/36 mosquito cells, recombinant virus
   bearing putative Vero-cell adapting mutations were first generated in C6/36 cells and then
   virus titers were determined in both C6/36 and Vero cells. As shown in Table 35, addition
10 of a single mutation to rDEN2/4A30 resulted in a greater than 1000-fold increase in titer in
   Vero cells, confirming the Vero cell adaptation phenotype conferred by these mutations.
   However, the combination of two separate mutations into a single virus did not increase the
   titer in Vero cells beyond the level observed for viruses bearing a single adaptation
   mutation. Inclusion of either the 7182 or 7630 mutation in the cDNA of rDEN2/4A30
15 allowed the virus to be recovered directly in Vero cells, circumventing the need to recover
   the virus in C6/36 cells.
            Characterization of the growth properties of rDEN4 viruses containing single
   and multiple defined Vero cell adaptation mutations. To confirm the ability of Vero
   cell adaptation mutations to enhance growth of DEN4 viruses, site-directed mutagenesis
20 was used to generate rDEN4 viruses encoding selected individual mutations as described in
   Examples 1 and 3. Five mutations in NS4B (7153, 7162, 7163, 7182, and 7546) from the
   list of repeated mutations in the 5-FU mutant viruses (Table 32) were introduced singly into
   the p4 cDNA clone. In addition, the mosquito-restricted, rDEN4-7129 virus was evaluated
   for enhanced growth in Vero cells since the location of this mutation is in the same region
25 of NS4B. Each virus, including wild-type rDEN4, was recovered, terminally diluted, and
   propagated in C6/36 cells to prevent introduction of additional Vero cell adaptation
   mutations, however, because of its restricted growth in C6/36 cells,      rDEN4-7129 was
   propagated only in Vero cells.
            Plaque size was evaluated for each mutant rDEN4 virus in Vero cells and C6/36
30 cells and compared to wild-type rDEN4. Six-well plates of each cell were inoculated with
   dilutions of virus and plaques were visualized five days later. Representative plaques are
   illustrated in Figure 10 and demonstrate that the presence of a Vero cell adaptation
                                                -58-

   mutation does indeed confer increased virus cell to cell spread and growth specifically in
   Vero cells. In C6/36 cells, average plaque size was approximately 0.50 mm for both wild
   type rDEN4 and each mutant virus (except for rDEN4-7546 and rDEN4-7129 which were
   smaller than wild-type; see Example 5). However, rDEN4 viruses expressing mutation
 5 7162, 7163, 7182, and 7129 had a greater than two-fold increase in plaque size in Vero
   cells compared to wild-type rDEN4 virus. A smaller but consistent increase in plaque size
   was observed for rDEN4-7153 and rDEN4-7546.
           Growth kinetics and virus yield in Vero cells was assessed for the same panel of
   rDEN4 viruses. Vero cells were infected at an MOI of 0.01 and samples were removed
10 daily for 10 days, titered on Vero cells, and plaques were visualized. The results in Figure
    11 indicate that the presence of a Vero cell adaptation mutation increased the kinetics of
   virus growth, but had only a marginal effect on the peak virus yield. At day four post
   infection, wild-type rDEN4 grew to 5.2 logioPFU/ml while the level of replication in
   rDEN4-7129-infected cells was 100-fold higher. The rest of the mutant rDEN4 viruses had
15 an increased yield at day four ranging from 0.9 (rDEN4-7153) to 1.6 (rDEN4-7162 and
   7163) logioPFU/ml.       Interestingly, enhanced kinetics of virus growth correlated with
   increased plaque size in Vero cells. The peak virus yield was reached by day 6 post
   infection for rDEN4-7129, -7162, -7163, and -7182 while wild-type rDEN4 did not reach
   peak titer until day 10. However, the peak virus yield was only slightly higher in rDEN4
20 viruses expressing Vero cell adaptation mutations.
           In an effort to further enhance rDEN4 replication, especially the peak virus yield,
   combinations of selected Vero cell adaptation mutations were introduced into the rDEN4
   background.      Three viruses with dual mutations were generated: rDEN4-7153-7163,
   rDEN4-7153-7182, and rDEN4-7546-7630 and tested in a Vero cell time course infection
25 as described above along with rDEN4 and rDEN4-7162 as a positive control (Figure 12).
   The viruses expressing combined mutations grew in a nearly identical manner to rDEN4
   7162 indicating that these selected combinations did not enhance the kinetics or peak virus
   yield.   Additional combinations of these and other Vero cell adaptation mutations are
   envisioned as increasing peak virus yield.
30         Discussion. Some of the growth promoting mutations listed in Table 32 are also
   found in homologous regions of DENI, DEN2, and DEN3 and are envisioned as serving to
   promote the replication of these viruses in Vero cells. Specifically, the growth promoting
                                                ~59-

   mutations indicated in Table 32 that are present in a DEN4 virus are envisioned as being
   useful for importation into homologous regions of other flaviviruses, such as DEN1, DEN2
   and DEN3. Examples of such conserved regions are shown in Appendix 4 and are listed in
   Table 36. The nucleotides for both mutation 7129 and 7182 are conserved in all four
 5 dengue virus serotypes. It is also interesting to note that mutation 7129 not only increases
   growth in Vero cells (Figure 10), but it also forms small plaques in mosquito cells (Figure
   6, Table 25). Lee et al. previously passaged DEN3 virus in Vero cells and performed
   limited sequence analysis of only the structural gene regions of the resulting viruses (Lee,
   E. et al. 1997 Virology 232:281-90).         From this analysis a menu of Vero adaptation
10 mutations was assembled.        Although none of these mutations correspond to the Vero
   adaptation mutations identified in this Example, a single mutation at amino acid position
   202 in DEN3 corresponds to mutation 1542 identified in 5-FU mutant virus #1012. The
   current Example emphasizes the importance in this type of study of determining the
   sequence of the entire viral genome.
15         Vero cell growth optimized viruses are envisioned as having usefulness in the
   following areas. First, the yield of a live attenuated vaccine virus in Vero cells is predicted
   to be augmented. The live attenuated vaccine candidate is conveniently a DEN4 or other
   dengue virus or a DEN1/4, DEN2/4, or DEN3/4 antigenic chimeric virus, or a chimeric
   virus of another flavivirus based on the DEN4 background. The increased yield of vaccine
20 virus is envisioned as decreasing the cost of vaccine manufacture.         Second, Vero cell
   adaptation mutations that are attenuating mutations, such as the 4995 mutation, are
   envisioned as being stable during the multiple passage and amplification of virus in Vero
   cell cultures that is required for production of a large number of vaccine doses. Third, Vero
   cell adaptation mutations are actually required for the growth of the rDEN2/4A30 vaccine
25 candidate in Vero cells. Fourth, the increase in yield of a DEN wild type or an attenuated
   virus is envisioned as making it economically feasible to manufacture an inactivated virus
   vaccine. Fiffl, the presence of the Vero cell growth promoting mutations in the DEN4
   vector of the rDEN1/4, rDEN2/4, and rDEN3/4 antigenic chimeric viruses or other
   flavivirus chimeric viruses based on DEN4 is envisioned as permitting the viruses to grow
30 to a high titer and as thereby being useful in the manufacture of a inactivated virus vaccine.
   Sixth, the insertion of Vero cell growth promoting mutations into cDNAs such as
   rDEN2/4A30 is envisioned as permitting recovery of virus directly in Vero cells, for which
                                                  -60-

   there are qualified master cell banks for manufacture, rather than in C6/36 cells for which
   qualified cell banks are not available.      And seventh, insertion of the 7129 and 7182
   mutations into DEN1, DEN2, or DEN3 wt viruses is envisioned as increasing their ability
   to replicate efficiently and be recovered from cDNA in Vero cells.

                            Assembly of a List of Attenuating Mutations
            The data presented in these examples permits the assembly of a list of attenuating
   mutations that is summarized in Table 37. This list contains individual mutations identified
   in Tables 13 - 16, 20, and 21 that are known to independently specify an attenuation
10 phenotype. Mutation 7129 is also included since it is derived from virus 5-lAl shown to
   be attenuated in mosquitoes. We envision using various combinations of mutations from
   this list to generate viruses with sets of desirable properties such as restricted growth in the
   liver or in the brain as taught in Example 3 (Table 18) and Example 4 (Tables 23 and 24).
   These mutations are also combinable with other previously described attenuating mutations
15 such as the A30 mutation, as taught in Example 1 (Table 6 ) and Example 3 (Table 19) to
   produce recombinant viruses that are satisfactorily attenuated and immunogenic. Mutations
   listed in Table 37 are also envisioned as being combined with other previously described
   attenuating mutations such as other deletion mutations or other point mutations (Blok, J. et
   al. 1992 Virology 187:573-90; Butrapet, S. et al. 2000 J Virol 74:3011-9; Men, R. et al.
20  1996 J Virol 70:3930-7; Puri, B. et al. 1997 J Gen Virol 78:2287-91).
            The possibility of importing an attenuating mutation present in one paramyxovirus
   into a homologous region of a second paranyxovirus has recently been described (Durbin,
   A.P. et al. 1999 Virology 261:319-30; Skiadopoulos, M.H. et al. 1999 Virology 260:125
   35). Such an importation confers an att phenotype to the second virus or, alternatively,
25 further attenuates the virus for growth in vivo.         Similarly we envision importing an
   attenuating mutation present in one flavivirus to a homologous region of a second flavivirus
   which would confer an att phenotype to the second flavivirus or, alternatively, would
   further attenuate the virus for growth in vivo.        Specifically, the attenuating mutations
   indicated in Table 37 are envisioned as being useful for importation into homologous
30 regions of other flaviviruses.     Examples of such homologous regions are indicated in
   Appendix 4 for the mutations listed in Table 37.

            Evaluation of Dengue Virus Vaccine In Humans And Rhesus Monkeys
           The present example evaluates the attenuation for humans and rhesus monkeys (as
   an animal model) of a DEN-4 mutant bearing a 30 nucleotide deletion (A30) that was
 5 introduced into its 3' untranslated region by site-directed mutagenesis and that was found
   previously to be attenuated for rhesus monkeys (Men, R. et al. 1996 J Virol 70:3930-7), as
   representative of the evaluation of any dengue virus vaccine for attenuation in humans and
   rhesus monkeys (as an animal model).
           Viruses and cells.      The wild type (wt) DEN-4 virus strain 814669 (Dominica,
10 1981), originally isolated in Aedes pseudoscutellaris(AP61) cells, was previously plaque
   purified in LLC-MK2 cells and amplified in C6/36 cells as described (Mackow, E. et al.
   1987 Virology 159:217-28). For further amplification, the C6/36 suspension was passaged
   2 times in Vero (WHO) cells maintained in MEM-E (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY)
   supplemented with 10% FBS. Viruses derived from RNA transfection or used for clinical
15 lot development were grown in Vero (WHO) cells maintained in serum-free media, VP
   SFM (Life Technologies).
           Construction of DEN-4 deletion mutants.           A 30 nucleotide (nt) deletion was
   previously introduced into the 3' untranslated region of the 2A cDNA clone of wt DEN-4
   strain 814669 as described (Men, R. et al. 1996 J Virol 70:3930-7). This deletion removes
20 nucleotides 10478 - 10507, and was originally designated 3'd 172-143, signifying the
   location of the deletion relative to the 3' end of the viral genome. In the current example,
   this deletion is referred to as A30. The full-length 2A cDNA clone has undergone several
   subsequent modifications to improve its ability to be genetically manipulated.           As
   previously described, a translationally-silent XhoI restriction enzyme site was engineered
25 near the end of the E region at nucleotide 2348 to create clone 2A-XhoI (Bray, M. & Lai,
   C.J. 1991 PNAS USA 88:10342-6). In this example, the viral coding sequence of the 2A
   AhoI cDNA clone was further modified using site-directed mutagenesis to create clone p4:
   a unique BbvCI restriction site was introduced near the C-prM junction (nucleotides 447
   452); an extra XbaI restriction site was ablated by mutation of nucleotide 7730; and a
30 unique SaclI restriction site was created in the NS5 region (nucleotides 9318 - 9320). Each
   of these engineered mutations is translationally silent and does not change the amino acid
   sequence of the viral polypeptide. Also, several mutations were made in the vector region
                                                 -62-

   of clone p4 to introduce or ablate additional restriction sites. The cDNA clone p4A30 was
   generated by introducing the A30 mutation into clone p4.          This was accomplished by
   replacing the MluI - KpnI fragment of p4 (nucleotides 10403 - 10654) with that derived
   from plasmid 2AA30 containing the 30 nucleotide deletion.          The cDNA clones p4 and
 5 p4A30 were subsequently used to generate recombinant viruses rDEN4 and rDEN4A30,
   respectively.
            Generation of viruses. Full-length RNA transcripts were synthesized from cDNA
   clones 2A and 2AA30 using SP6 RNA polymerase as previously described (Lai, C.J. et al.
    1991 PNAS USA 88:5139-43; Men, R. et al. 1996 J Virol 70:3930-7).             The reaction to
10 generate full-length RNA transcripts from cDNA clones p4 and p4A30 was modified and
   consisted of a 50 pil reaction mixture containing 1 pig linearized plasmid, 60 U SP6
   polymerase (New England Biolabs (NEB), Beverly, MA), 1X RNA polymerase buffer (40
   mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM spermidine, 10 mM dithiothreitol), 0.5 mM
   m7G(5')ppp(5')G cap       analog (NEB),     1 mM each nucleotide          triphosphate,   1 U
15 pyrophosphatase (NEB), and 80 U RNAse inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).                This
   reaction mixture was incubated at 40'C for 90 min and the resulting transcripts were
   purified using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).         For transfection of Vero cells,
   purified transcripts (1 pg) were mixed with 12 pil DOTAP liposome reagent (Roche) in
   saline containing 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.6) and added to cell monolayer cultures in a
20 6-well plate.    After 5 - 17 days, tissue culture medium was harvested, clarified by
   centrifugation, and virus was amplified in Vero cells. The presence of virus was confirmed
   by plaque titration. It should be noted that during the course of transfection and
    amplification of 2AA30 to create the vaccine lot, the virus underwent a total of 6 passages
    entirely in Vero cells. The remaining viruses, rDEN4 and rDEN4A30 were passaged 5
25 times in Vero cells to generate the virus suspension used for sequence analysis and studies
   in rhesus monkeys.
            Vaccine Production. An aliquot of clarified tissue culture fluid containing vaccine
    candidate 2AA30 was submitted to DynCorp (Rockville, MD) for amplification of virus in
   Vero cells and production of a vaccine lot. For vaccine production, 2AA30 infected tissue
30  culture supernatant was harvested, SPG buffer added (final concentration: 218 mM sucrose,
    6 mM L-glutamic acid, 3.8 mM potassium phosphate, monobasic, and 7.2 mM potassium
   phosphate, dibasic, pH 7.2), and the virus suspension was clarified by low speed
                                                -63-

   centrifugation. To degrade residual Vero cell DNA, the vaccine suspension was treated
   with Benzonase endonuclease (American International Chemical, Natick, MA), 100 U/ml
   and incubated for 1 hr at 37'C, followed by high-speed centrifugation (17,000 x g, 16 hr).
   The resulting virus pellet was gently rinsed with MEM-E, resuspended in MEM-E
 5 containing SPG, sonicated, distributed into heat-sealed ampoules, and stored frozen at
   70'C. Final container safety testing confirmed microbial sterility, tissue culture purity, and
   animal safety.    The 2AA30 vaccine lot (designated DEN4-9) has a titer of 7.48
   log10PFU/ml, with a single dose of 5.0 loglO PFU/ml containing <1 pg/ml Vero cell DNA
   and <0.001 U/ml Benzonase endonuclease.
10         Sequence of cDNA clones and viral genomes.         The nucleotide sequence of the
   viral genome region of cDNA plasmids 2A and p4 was determined on a 310 genetic
   analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using vector-specific and DEN-4-specific
   primers in BigDye terminator cycle sequencing reactions (Applied Biosystems).              The
   nucleotide sequence of the genomes of the parental wt DEN-4 strain 814669 and of
15 recombinant viruses 2A wt, 2AA30 (vaccine lot), rDEN4, and rDEN4A30 was also
   determined. Viral RNA was extracted from virus preparations and serum samples using the
   QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription (RT) was performed using
   random hexamers and the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Life
   Technologies).    Overlapping PCR fragments of approximately 2000 base pairs were
20 generated using optimized DEN-4 specific primers and Advantage cDNA polymerase
   (ClonTech, Palo Alto, CA).      Both strands of purified PCR fragments were sequenced
   directly using dye-terminator reactions as described above and results were assembled into
   a consensus sequence. To determine the nucleotide sequence of the viral RNA 5' and 3'
   regions, the 5' cap nucleoside of the viral RNA was removed with tobacco acid
25 pyrophosphatase (Epicentre, Madison, WI) followed by circularization of the RNA using
   RNA ligase (Epicentre).     RT-PCR was performed as described and a cDNA fragment
   spanning the ligation junction was sequenced using DEN-4 specific primers. GenBank
   accession numbers have been assigned as follows (virus: accession number): 814669:
   AF326573, 2AA30: AF326826, rDEN4: AF326825, and rDEN4A30: AF326827.
30         Human Vaccine Recipients. 20 normal healthy adult volunteers were recruited by
   the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health Center for Immunization Research
   (CIR) located in Baltimore, Maryland. The clinical protocol was reviewed and approved
                                               -64-

   by the Joint Committee for Clinical Investigation of the Johns Hopkins University School
   of Medicine and informed consent was obtained from each volunteer. Volunteers were
   enrolled in the study if they met the following inclusion criteria: 18-45 years of age; no
   history of chronic illness; a normal physical examination; human immunodeficiency virus
 5 antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and hepatitis C antibody negative;
   no stool occult blood; and normal values for complete blood cell count (CBC) with
   differential, hematocrit, platelet count, serum creatinine, serum aspartate amino transferase
   (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, prothrombin time
   (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and urinalysis. Female volunteers were required
10 to have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to vaccination and on the day of vaccination
   and to agree to use contraception or abstain from sexual intercourse for the duration of the
   study. Volunteers also lacked serological evidence of prior flavivirus infection as defined
   by hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer < 1:10 to DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, DEN-4,
   St. Louis encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, or yellow fever virus and a plaque
15 reduction neutralization titer < 1:10 to DEN-4 and yellow fever virus.
            Studies in Humans. Volunteers were immunized in three successive cohorts of
   four, six, and ten volunteers to assess the safety of the vaccine. In this study, an illness was
   defined as the following: dengue virus infection associated with a platelet count of <
   90,000/mm3 ; serum ALT > 4 times normal; oral temperature >38'C for > 2 successive
20 days; or headache and/or myalgia lasting > 2 successive days. Systemic illness was defined
   as the occurrence of fever >38'C for > 2 consecutive days, or any 2 of the following for at
   least two consecutive study days: headache, malaise, anorexia, and myalgia/arthralgia. The
   trials were conducted between October and April, a time of low mosquito prevalence, to
   reduce the risk of transmission of vaccine virus from the volunteers to the community.
25          On the day of vaccination, vaccine candidate 2AA30 was diluted to 5.3 log10PFU/ml
   in sterile saline for injection, USP, and each volunteer was injected subcutaneously with a
    0.5 ml containing 5.0 logioPFU of vaccine into the left deltoid region. Volunteers were
    given a home diary card on which they were to record their temperature twice daily for
    days 0-5 post-vaccination. The volunteers returned to the clinic each day for examination
30 by a physician and their diary cards were reviewed. The injection site was evaluated for
    erythema, induration, and tenderness. Clinical signs and symptoms such as headache, rash,
   petechiae, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, abdominal tenderness, anorexia, nausea,
                                                 -65-

   fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, eye pain, and photophobia were assessed daily.    Symptoms
   were graded as mild (no need for treatment or a change in activity), moderate (treatment
   needed or change in activity noted, yet still able to continue daily activity) or severe
   (confined to bed). Blood was drawn for CBC with differential and for virus quantitation on
 5 days 0, 2 and 4. Volunteers were admitted to the inpatient unit at the CIR on the sixth day
   after immunization.    The study physician evaluated all volunteers each day by physical
   examination and interview.        The volunteers had their blood pressure, pulse, and
   temperature recorded four times a day.        Blood was drawn each day for CBC with
   differential and for virus quantitation and every other day for ALT measurement.
10 Volunteers were confined to the inpatient unit until discharge on study day 15. On study
   days 28 and 42, volunteers returned for physical examination and blood was drawn for
   virus quantitation (day 28) and for serum antibody measurement (day 28 and 42).
           Virus quantitation and amplification.       Serum was obtained for detection of
   virenia and titration of virus in positive specimens. For these purposes 8.5 ml of blood
15 was collected in a serum separator tube and incubated at room temperature for less than 30
   min. Serum was decanted into 0.5 ml aliquots, rapidly frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and
   stored at -70'C. Serum aliquots were thawed and serial 10-fold dilutions were inoculated
   onto Vero cell monolayer cultures in 24-well plates. After one hour incubation at room
   temperature, the monolayers were overlaid with 0.8% methylcellulose in OptiMEM (Life
20 Technologies) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Following incubation at
   37'C for four days, virus plaques were visualized by immunoperoxidase staining. Briefly,
   cell monolayers were fixed in 80% methanol for 30 min and rinsed with antibody buffer
   (5% nonfat milk in phosphate buffered saline). Rabbit polyclonal DEN-4 antibodies were
   diluted 1:1000 in antibody buffer and added to each well followed by a one hr incubation at
25 37 0 C.  Primary antibody was removed and the cell monolayers were washed twice with
   antibody buffer. Peroxidase-labelled goat-anti-rabbit IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was
   diluted 1:500 in antibody buffer and added to each well followed by a one hr incubation at
   37 0 C. Secondary antibody was removed and the wells were washed twice with phosphate
   buffered saline. Peroxidase substrate (4 chloro-1-napthol in H202) was added to each well
30 and visible plaques were counted.
           For amplification of virus in serum samples, a 0.3 ml aliquot of serum was
   inoculated directly onto a single well of a 6-well plate of Vero cell monolayers and
                                                -66-

   incubated at 37C for 7 days. Cell culture fluid was then assayed for virus by plaque assay
   as described above.
           Serology. Hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assays were performed as previously
   described (Clarke, D.H. & Casals, J. 1958 Am J Trop Med Hyg 7:561-73).             Plaque
 5 reduction neutralization titers (PRNT) were determined by a modification of the technique
   described by Russell (Russell, P.K. et al. 1967 JImmunol 99:285-90). Briefly, test sera
   were heat inactivated (56'C for 30 min) and serial 2-fold dilutions beginning at 1:10 were
   made in OptiMEM supplemented with 0.25% human serum albumin. rDEN4A30 virus,
   diluted to a final concentration of 1000 PFU/ml in the same diluent, was added to equal
10 volumes of the diluted serum and mixed well. The virus/serun mixture was incubated at
   37'C for 30 min.       Cell culture medium was removed from 90% confluent monolayer
   cultures of Vero cells on 24-well plates and 50 l of virus/serum mixture was transferred
   onto duplicate cell monolayers. Cell monolayers were incubated for 60 min at 370 C and
   overlaid with 0.8% methylcellulose in OptiMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Samples
15 were incubated at 370 C for 4 days after which plaques were visualized by
   immunoperoxidase staining as described above, and a 60% plaque-reduction neutralization
   titer was calculated.
           Studies in rhesus monkeys. Evaluation of the replication and immunogenicity of
   wt virus 814669, and recombinant viruses 2A wt, 2AA30 (vaccine lot), rDEN4, and
20 rDEN4A30 in juvenile rhesus monkeys was performed as previously described (Men R. et
   al. 1996 J Virol 70:3930-7).     Briefly, dengue virus seronegative monkeys were injected
   subcutaneously with 5.0 log 0 PFU of virus diluted in L-15 medium (Quality Biological,
   Gaithersburg, MD) containing SPG buffer. A dose of 1 ml was divided between two
   injections in each side of the upper shoulder area. Monkeys were observed daily and blood
25 was collected on days 0 - 10 and 28, and processed for serum, which was stored frozen at
   70'C. Titer of virus in serum samples was determined by plaque assay on Vero cells as
   described above.      Neutralizing antibody titers were determined for the day 28 serum
   samples as described above. A group of monkeys inoculated with either 2AA30 (n1= 4) or
   wt virus 814669 (n = 8) were challenged on day 42 with a single dose of 5.0 logic0 PFU/ml
30 wt virus 814669 and blood was collected for 10 days.         Husbandry and care of rhesus
   monkeys was in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the
   humane use of laboratory animals.
                                                -67-

            Construction and characterization of DEN-4 wild type and deletion mutant
   viruses. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the previously described wt
   814669 virus, the DEN-4 2A wt virus derived from it (designated 2A wt), and the 2AA30
   vaccine candidate derived from 2A wt virus were first determined.        Sequence analysis
 5 showed that the wt 814669 virus used in this study had apparently accumulated 2 missense
   mutations (nucleotides 5826 and 7630) and 3 silent mutations during its passage and
   amplification since these mutations were not described in previously published reports of
   the viral sequence (GenBank accession number M14931) and were not present in the 2A
   cDNA derived from the virus. Sequence comparison between viruses 2A wt and vaccine
10 lot 2AA30 revealed that 2AA30 accumulated 2 missense mutations (nucleotides 7153 and
   8308) and also confirmed the presence of the A30 mutation (nucleotides 10478 - 10507) as
   well as an additional deletion of nucleotide 10475, which occurred during the original
   construction of the A30 mutation (Men, R. et al. 1996 J Virol 70:3930-7). This sequence
   analysis revealed significant sequence divergence between the biologically-derived wt
15 814669 virus and its recombinant 2A wt derivative and between the 2A wt and 2AA30
   virus. Since the 2A wt and 2AA30 viruses differed at nucleotides other than the deletion
   mutation, the attenuation phenotype previously reported for 2AA30 (Men, R. et al. 1996 J
   Virol 70:3930-7) could not be formally ascribed solely to the A30 mutation and may have
   been specified by the mutations at nucleotides 7153, 8308, 10475, or the A30 deletion.
20          To determine whether the A30 mutation was responsible for the observed
   attenuation of 2AA30, a second pair of viruses, one with and one without the A30 mutation,
   were produced for evaluation in monkeys.          A new DEN-4 cDNA vector construct,
   designated p4, was derived from the 2A-XhoI cDNA clone and translationally-silent
   mutations were introduced to add or ablate several restriction enzyme sites. These sites
25 were added to facilitate the future genetic manipulation of this DEN-4 wt cDNA by the
   introduction of other attenuating mutations if needed. The sequence of the genomic region
   of the p4 cDNA plasmid was identical to that of the 2A wt virus except for the engineered
   restriction site changes and a point mutation at nucleotide 2440 which was introduced
   during the original mutagenesis of the 2A cDNA plasmid to create the XhoI site (Bray, M.
30 & Lai, C.J. 1991 PNAS USA 88:10342-6). The A30 mutation and the neighboring deletion
   at nucleotide 10475 were co-introduced into the p4 plasmid by replacing a short restriction
   fragment with one derived from the cDNA clone of 2AA30. RNA transcripts derived from
                                               -68-

   the p4 cDNA clone and from its A30 derivative each yielded virus (designated rDEN4 wt
   and rDEN4A30, respectively) following transfection of Vero cells. Sequence analysis of
   the rDEN4 virus revealed that during its passage and amplification in Vero cells it
   accumulated 2 missense mutations (nucleotides 4353 and 6195), a silent mutation
 5 (nucleotide 10157), and a point mutation in the 3' untranslated region (nucleotide 10452).
   In addition to containing the A30 and the accompanying deletion at nucleotide 10475,
   rDEN4A30 had also accumulated a missense mutation (nucleotide 7163) and a silent
   mutation (nucleotide 7295).
            Parental wt 814669 virus and recombinant viruses 2A wt, 2AA30, rDEN4, and
10 rDEN4A30 each replicate in Vero cells to a titer exceeding 7.0 log1 PFU/ml, and their
   replication is not temperature sensitive at 390 C.
            Virus replication, immunogenicity, and efficacy in monkeys. Groups of rhesus
   monkeys were inoculated with wt DEN-4 814669, 2A wt, rDEN4, 2AA30 and rDEN4A30
   to assess the level of restriction of replication specified by the A30 mutation.    Serum
15 samples were collected daily and titer of virus present in the serum was determined by
   plaque enumeration on Vero cell monolayer cultures. Monkeys inoculated with wt 814669
   virus or its recombinant counterparts, 2A wt or rDEN4, were viremic for 3 to 4 days with a
   mean peak virus titer of nearly 2 log1 PFU/ml. Monkeys inoculated with virus 2AA30 or
   rDEN4A30 had a lower frequency of viremia (83% and 50%, respectively),, were viremic
20  for only about 1 day, and the mean peak titer was 10-fold lower. Monkeys inoculated with
   DEN-4 814669, 2A wt, or rDEN4 viruses developed high levels of neutralizing antibody,
   with mean titers between 442 and 532, consistent with their presumed wild type phenotype.
   Monkeys inoculated with 2AA30 or rDEN4A30 developed a lower level of neutralizing
    antibody, with mean titers of 198 and 223, respectively.     The decrease in neutralizing
25  antibody titer in response to 2AA30 and rDEN4A30 is consistent with the attenuation
   phenotype of these viruses. Monkeys inoculated with either 2AA30 (n = 4) or wt 814669
   virus (n = 8) were challenged after 42 days with wt virus 814669. Dengue virus was not
    detected in any serum sample collected for up to 10 days following virus challenge,
    indicating that these monkeys were completely protected following immunization with
30  either wt virus or vaccine candidate 2AA30.
            Since DEN-4 814669, 2A wt, and rDEN4 each manifest the same level of
    replication and immunogenicity in rhesus monkeys, it is reasonable to conclude that the
                                                 -69-

   identified sequence differences between these presumptive wild type viruses that arose
   during passage in tissue culture or during plasmid construction do not significantly affect
   their level of replication in vivo. Similarly, the comparable level of attenuation of 2AA30
   and rDEN4A30 indicates that the mutations shared by these viruses, namely, the A30
 5 mutation and its accompanying 10475 deletion mutation, are probably responsible for the
   attenuation of these viruses rather than their incidental sequence differences.
           Clinical Response to immunization with 2AA30. The 2AA30 vaccine candidate
   was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 10' PFU to 20 seronegative volunteers. Each
   of the vaccinees was infected and the virus was well tolerated by all vaccinees. Viremia
10 was detected in 70% of the vaccinees, was present only at low titer, and did not extend
   beyond day 11.
           None of the 20 vaccinees reported soreness or swelling at the injection site. Mild
   erythema (1-3 mm) around the injection site was noted on examination of 8 volunteers 30
   minutes post-vaccination which resolved by the next day in 7 of those volunteers and by the
15 third day in the remaining volunteer. Mild tenderness to pressure at the vaccination site
   was noted in 2 volunteers and lasted a maximum of 48 hours.                   During physical
   examination, ten volunteers (50%) were noted to a have a very mild dengue-like
   erythematous macular rash (truncal distribution) which occurred with greatest frequency on
   day 10. None of the volunteers noted the rash themselves, and it was asymptomatic in each
20 instance. Rash was seen only in vaccinees with detectable viremia. Volunteers did not
   develop systemic illness.       Seven volunteers noted an occasional headache that was
   described as mild, lasting less than 2 hours, and was not present in any volunteer on two
   consecutive days.        One volunteer reported fever of 38.6'C and 38.2'C without
   accompanying headache, chills, eye pain, photophobia, anorexia, myalgia, or arthralgia as
25 an outpatient the evening of day 3 and day 5, respectively. However, this volunteer was
   afebrile when evaluated by the study staff on the morning of days 3, 4, 5 and 6. All other
   temperature measurements recorded by the volunteer or study staff were normal. Although
   tourniquet tests were not performed, two volunteers were noted to have petechiae at the site
   of the blood pressure cuff after a blood pressure measurement was performed (one on day
30 6, the other on days 7 and 10). Both of these volunteers had normal platelet counts at that
   time and throughout the study.
                                                 -70-

           Significant hematological abnormalities were not seen in any vaccinee.         Three
   vaccinees with presumed benign ethnic neutropenia manifested an absolute neutrophil
   count (ANC) below 1500/mm3 . These three volunteers had baseline ANCs which were
   significantly lower than the remaining 17 volunteers and which did not decrease
 5 disproportionately to the other volunteers.      Two of the three volunteers who became
   neutropenic never had detectable viremia. A mild increase in ALT levels was noted in 4
   volunteers, and a more significant -increase in ALT level (up to 238 TU/L) was noted in one
   volunteer. These ALT elevations were transient, were not associated with hepatomegaly,
   and were completely asymptomatic in each of the 5 volunteers.          Elevated ALT values
10 returned to normal by day 26 post-vaccination. The volunteer with the high ALT value was
   also noted to have an accompanying mild elevation in AST on day 14 (104 TU/L) which
   also returned to baseline by day 26 post-vaccination.       This volunteer did not have an
   associated increase in LDH, bilirubin, or alkaline phosphatase levels.
           Serologic response of humans to immunization with 2AA30. Each of the twenty
15 vaccinees developed a significant rise in serum neutralizing antibody titer against DEN-4
   by day 28. The level of serum neutralizing antibody was similar in viremic (1:662) and
   non-viremic vaccinees (1:426). The DEN-4 neutralizing antibody titers of both groups had
   not changed significantly by day 42.
           Genetic stability of the A30 mutation. RT-PCR and sequence analysis of viral
20 RNA isolated from serum samples (n = 6) collected from volunteers 6 to 10 days post
   vaccination confirmed the presence of the A30 mutation and neighboring deletion at
   nucleotide 10475.

           The pharmacologically active compounds of this invention can be processed in
   accordance with conventional methods of galenic pharmacy to produce medicinal agents
   for administration to patients, e.g., mammals including humans.
20         The compounds of this invention can be employed in admixture with conventional
   excipients, i.e., pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable
   for parenteral, enteral (e.g., oral) or topical application, which do not deleteriously react
   with the active compounds. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include but are
   not limited to water, salt solutions, alcohols, gum arabic, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols,
25 polyethylene glycols, gelatin, carbohydrates such as lactose, amylose or starch, magnesium
   stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, perfume oil, fatty acid monoglycerides and
   diglycerides,    pentaerythritol  fatty  acid  esters, hydroxy methylcellulose,        polyvinyl
   pyrrolidone, etc. The pharmaceutical preparations can be sterilized and if desired mixed
   with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers,
30 salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, coloring, flavoring and/or aromatic
   substances and the like which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds. They
   can also be combined where desired with other active agents, e.g., vitamins.

           For parenteral application, particularly suitable are injectable, sterile solutions,
   preferably oily or aqueous solutions, as well as suspensions, emulsions, or implants,
   including suppositories. Ampoules are convenient unit dosages.
           For enteral application, particularly suitable are tablets, dragees, liquids, drops,
 5 suppositories, or capsules. A syrup, elixir, or the like can be used wherein a sweetened
   vehicle is employed.
           For topical application, there are employed as non-sprayable forms, viscous to semi
   solid or solid fonns comprising a carrier compatible with topical application and having a
   dynamic viscosity preferably greater than water. Suitable formulations include but are not
10 limited to solutions, suspensions, emulsions, creams, ointments, powders, liniments, salves,
   aerosols, etc., which are, if desired, sterilized or mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g.,
   preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, buffers or salts for influencing osmotic pressure,
   etc. For topical application, also suitable are sprayable aerosol preparations wherein the
   active ingredient, preferably in combination with a solid or liquid inert carrier material, is
15 packaged in a squeeze bottle or in admixture with a pressurized volatile, normally gaseous
   propellant, e.g., a freon.
           The vaccine can also contain variable but small quantities of endotoxin, free
   formaldehyde, and preservative, which have been found safe and not contributing to the
   reactogenicity of the vaccines for humans.

                                     Pharmaceutical Purposes
           The administration of the vaccine composition may be for either a "prophylactic" or
   "therapeutic" purpose.     When provided prophylactically, the compositions are provided
   before any symptom of dengue viral infection becomes manifest.               The prophylactic
25 administration of the composition serves to prevent or attenuate any subsequent infection.
   When provided therapeutically, the live attenuated or inactivated viral vaccine is provided
   upon the detection of a symptom of actual infection. The therapeutic administration of the
   compound(s) serves to attenuate any actual infection. See, e.g., Berkow et al. eds. 1987 The
   Merck Manual, 15th edition, Merck and Co., Rahway, N.J.; Goodman et al. eds. 1990
30 Goodman and Gilman's The PharmacologicalBasis of Therapeutics, 8th edition, Pergamon
   Press, Inc., Elmsford, N.Y.; Avery's Drug Treatment: Principles and Practice of Clinical
   Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 3rd edition, ADIS Press, LTD., Williams and Wilkins,

   Baltimore, Md. 1987; Katzung, ed. 1992 Basic and ClinicalPharmacology, Fifth Edition,
   Appleton and Lange, Norwalk, Conn.
           A live attenuated or inactivated vaccine composition of the present invention may
   thus be provided either before the onset of infection (so as to prevent or attenuate an
 5 anticipated infection) or after the initiation of an actual infection.
           The vaccines of the invention can be formulated according to known methods to
   prepare pharmaceutically useful compositions, whereby live attenuated or inactivated
   viruses are combined in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle.                 A
   composition is said to be a "pharmacologically acceptable vehicle" if its administration can
10 be tolerated by a recipient patient. Suitable vehicles are well known to those in the art, e.g.,
   in Osol, A. ed. 1980 Remington's PharmaceuticalSciences Mack Publishing Co, Easton,
   Pa. pp. 1324-1341.
           For purposes of administration, a vaccine composition of the present invention is
   administered to a human recipient in a therapeutically effective amount. Such an agent is
15 said to be administered in a "therapeutically effective amount" if the amount administered
   is physiologically significant.       A vaccine composition of the present invention is
   physiologically significant if its presence results in a detectable change in the physiology of
   a recipient patient that generates a host immune response against at least one dengue
   serotype, stimulates the production of neutralizing antibodies, or leads to protection against
20 challenge.
           The "protection" provided need not be absolute, i.e., the dengue infection need not
   be totally prevented or eradicated, if there is a statistically significant improvement
   compared with a control population or set of patients.            Protection may be limited to
   mitigating the severity or rapidity of onset of symptoms of the dengue virus infection.

                                  Pharmaceutical Administration
           A vaccine of the present invention may confer resistance to one or more dengue
   serotypes by immunization. In immunization, an live attenuated or inactivated vaccine
   composition is administered prophylactically, according to a method of the present
30 invention. In another embodiment a live attenuated or inactivated vaccine composition is
   administered therapeutically, according to a different method of the present invention.
                                                  -75-

           The present invention thus includes methods for preventing or attenuating infection
   by at least one dengue serotype. As used herein, a vaccine is said to prevent or attenuate a
   disease if its administration results either in the total or partial attenuation (i.e.,
   suppression) of a symptom or condition of the disease, or in the total or partial immunity of
 5 the individual to the disease.
           At least one live attenuated or inactivated dengue virus, or composition thereof, of
   the present invention may be administered by any means that achieve the intended purpose,
   using a pharmaceutical composition as previously described.
           For example, administration of such a composition may be by various parenteral
10 routes such as subcutaneous, intravenous, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal,
   intranasal, oral or transdermal routes. Parenteral administration can be by bolus injection
   or by gradual perfusion over time.         A preferred mode of using a pharmaceutical
   composition of the present invention is by intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous
   application. See, e.g., Berkow et al. eds. 1987 The Merck Manual 15th edition, Merck and
15 Co.,   Rahway,     N.J.;  Goodman     et al. eds.    1990  Goodman and Gilman's The

           A typical regimen for preventing, suppressing, or treating a dengue virus related
   pathology, comprises administration of an effective amount of a vaccine composition as
   described herein, administered as a single treatment, or repeated as enhancing or booster
25 dosages, over a period up to and including between one week and about 24 months, or any
   range or value therein.
           It will be appreciated that the actual preferred amounts of active compound in a
   specific case will vary according to the specific compound being utilized, the compositions
   formulated, the mode of application, and the particular situs and organism being treated.
30 Dosages for a given host can be determined using conventional considerations, e.g., by
   customary comparison of the differential activities of the subject compounds and of a
   known agent, e.g., by means of an appropriate, conventional pharmacological protocol.
                                                -76-

         The dosage of a live attenuated virus vaccine for a mammalian (e.g., human) subject
  can be from about 10 -107 plaque forming units (PFU)/kg, or any range or value therein.
  The dose of inactivated vaccine can range from about 0.1 to 50 pLg of E protein. However,
  the dosage should be a safe and effective amount as determined by conventional methods,
5 using existing vaccines as a starting point.
         The compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device which
  may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may
  for example comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser
  device may be accompanied by instructions for administration.

b   DEN4 = rDEN4 (GenBank AF326825); DEN1 = Western pacific (GenBank U88535);
   DEN2= New Guinea C (GenBank AF038403); DEN3 = H87 (GenBank M93130)
    This mutation results in decreased replication of DEN4 in mosquitoes.
d Underlined    nucleotides are shared between DEN4 and one or more additional DEN types.
