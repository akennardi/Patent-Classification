                          Engine specific assembly stand mount
Abstract:
The engine specific assembly stand mount is used by engine builders to attach the engine
block to a stand by bolting it directly to the bellhousing bolt holes on the engine and
interfacing the mount with a traditional style engine stand.
This design allows the engine builder to more quickly and easily attach engines to a stand, as
well as avoids the engine builder having to remove the engine from the stand to access
fasteners that are often blocked by the typical adjustable mounting system.

Description:
Traditionally automotive engine assembly stands are provided with a generic, adjustable
mounting system made up of steel arms and slots that are positioned by the user to hold
the engine block by the bellhousing bolt holes. The generic, one size adjusts for all design is
both difficult to setup and restricts access to the rear sections of the engine during
assembly.
The engine specific assembly stand mount installs into the same interface with the stand
base as the adjustable mount, however is specially designed to bolt directly to the
bellhousing bolts of each make of engine for example the Chevrolet small block V8 or
Ford inline 6.
Because the mounting points are static this allows access holes to be positioned in the
necessary locations to assemble the engine completely without removing it from the
stand.
The Engine specific assembly stand mount will typically be constructed in steel.
The invention may be better understood by referencing the illustrations of the invention
where;

        block and engine stand.
    -   Figures 2 and 3 show the features of the engine specific assembly stand mount
        from two angles.
    -   Figure 4 shows a traditional, adjustable engine assembly stand mount and

                         Engine specific assembly stand mount
The claims defining the invention are as follows:
   1. A mounting system for engine assembly stands that is specific to each engine
       make or model and is non-adjustable
   2. A mounting system for engine assembly stands that has access holes positioned
       such that all rear engine assembly fasters can be accessed while the engine
       remains on the stand.
