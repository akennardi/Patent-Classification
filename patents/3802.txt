Cross-Reference to Related Applications
[0001] This is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, filed 5
July 2016, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
[0002] The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/188,595,
entitled "Female Protective Vest" and filed on July 3, 2015, the contents of which are
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
Field
[0003] Aspects of the present disclosure relate to tactical vests devices and more particularly to
tactical vests and other tactical devices, such as soft ballistic armor, configured to comport with
the female anatomy.
Background
[0004] Tactical vests, including plate carriers, concealable carriers, low visibility carriers, and
the like, are used by military, law enforcement, and other personnel to absorb the impact and
protect against penetration to the body from a threat, such as a ballistic projectile and shrapnel
from explosions. Such tactical vests are conventionally tailored to fit the body shape of a male
individual. Accordingly, when a female individual wears these conventional vests, her motion
is typical inhibited. These conventional vests are also uncomfortable due to the lack of support
and accommodation for the female anatomy. For example, a hard plate carried by these
conventional vests may exert excess compression on the breast tissue of a female wearer. It is
with these observations in mind, among others, that various aspects of the present disclosure
were conceived and developed.
Summary of Invention
[0005] Implementations described and claimed herein address the foregoing problems by
providing tactical devices configured for a female wearer and methods of manufacturing the
same. In one implementation, a tactical vest comprises an upper portion, a lower portion, and a

                                                   2
set of lateral portions of a front carrier. The upper portion has a set of arms connected by a
contoured center edge, and each of the upper arms has an upper side edge. The lower portion
has a set of outwardly extending edges each connected to a lower side edge. The lower side
edges extend distally to a bottom edge. Each of the lateral portions have a first edge connected
to a second edge at a lateral peak. The first edge is connected to one of the upper side edges of
the upper arms at an upper valley, and the second edge is connected to one of the outwardly
extending edges of the lower portion at a lower valley. The upper portion, the lower portion,
and the set of lateral portions form a carrier female shape.
[0006] In another implementation, a front carrier has an inner surface and an outer surface
forming an interior. A front carrier pocket is disposed on the outer surface of the front carrier,
and the front carrier pocket is adapted to receive a ballistic hard plate. A soft ballistic armor is
disposed in the interior of the front carrier. The soft ballistic amor has an armor female shape
defined by a set of lateral portions connecting an upper portion and a lower portion. A lateral
dart is disposed in each of the lateral portions. The lateral darts are each adapted to displace the
ballistic hard plate in a direction away from the inner surface of the front carrier.
[0007] In yet another implementation, a soft ballistic armor comprises an upper portion, a lower
portion, and a set of lateral portions. The upper portion has a contoured center edge connecting
a set of top edges. The upper portion has a set of upper side edges each extending inwardly
from one of the top edges. The lower portion has a set of outwardly extending edges each
connected to a lower side edge. The lower side edges extend distally to a bottom edge. Each of
the lateral portions are connected to one of the upper side edges at an upper valley and to one of
the outwardly extending edges at a lower valley. Each of the lateral portions extend outwardly
from the upper valley to the lower valley. The upper portion, the lower portion, and the set of
lateral portions form an armor female shape. A lateral dart is disposed in each of the lateral
portions.
[0008] Other implementations are also described and recited herein. Further, while multiple
implementations are disclosed, still other implementations of the presently disclosed technology
will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which
shows and describes illustrative implementations of the presently disclosed technology. As will
be realized, the presently disclosed technology is capable of modifications in various aspects, all

                                                   3
without departing from the spirit and scope of the presently disclosed technology. Accordingly,
the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not limiting.

Description of Embodiments
[0020] Aspects of the present disclosure involve tactical devices, such as tactical vests and soft
ballistic armor, adapted for the natural shape of a female wearer, while providing a full range of

                                                     4
motion and support and eliminating excess compression on the breast tissue. The tactical vests
may include, without limitation, plate carriers, concealable carriers, low visibility carriers, and
the other personal armor, used by military, law enforcement, and other personnel to absorb the
impact and protect against penetration to the body from a threat, such as a ballistic projectile and
shrapnel from explosions. In one aspect, a tactical vest includes a front carrier having a carrier
female shape and a soft ballistic armor having an armor female shape mirroring the carrier
female shape. The soft ballistic armor includes a set of lateral darts that contour around the
natural shape of the female wearer and displace a hard ballistic plate away from the wearer to
eliminate excess compression on the breast tissue.
[0021] To begin a detailed description of an example female tactical vest 100, reference is made
to Figures 1-6. It will be appreciated that the female tactical vest 100 illustrated in the Figures is
exemplary only and the presently disclosed technology may be implemented as a full tactical
entry vest, a plate carrier, a low visibility vest, a concealable vest, or the like.
[0022] Turning first to Figures 1-3, in one implementation, the female tactical vest 100 includes
a front carrier 102 and a back carrier 104. The front carrier 102 is shaped to accommodate the
anatomy of a female wearer. As such, in one implementation, the front carrier 102 has a carrier
female shape formed by an upper portion 106, a set of lateral portions 108, and a lower portion
110. The carrier female shape permits a full range of motion by and provides support to the
female wearer, while maximizing comfort. The back carrier 104 similarly includes an upper
back portion 112 and a lower back portion 114 adapted to maximize comfort without inhibiting
motion of the female wearer.
[0023] In one implementation, the female tactical vest 100 includes a front carrier pocket 116
extending from or otherwise attached to the front carrier 102. The front carrier pocket 116 may
be adapted to receive and hold one or more protective devices for absorbing the impact and
protecting against penetration to the body from a threat, such as a ballistic projectile and
shrapnel from explosions. Such protective devices may include, without limitation, a soft body
armor, a ballistic hard plate, a ballistic frame, a ballistic plate, a ballistic plate cover, and the
like.
[0024] For example, a hard plate may be disposed within the front carrier pocket 116 with a
stake face oriented away from the wearer and a back face oriented towards the wearer. A

                                                    5
ballistic plate cover may wrap around at least a portion of a periphery of the ballistic hard plate
to provide additional protection against side spall created by augmentation of the ballistic hard
plate. Such a ballistic cover further improves the structure of the front carrier pocket 116 and
enhances area coverage and range of motion for increased ergonomics and performance, while
providing additional ballistic coverage beyond a front edge of the ballistic hard plate and beyond
side edges of the ballistic hard plate.
[0025] A soft body armor may be disposed in the front carrier pocket 116 behind the ballistic
hard plate on the back face side to provide additional protection and force absorption. A
ballistic frame may be disposed within the front carrier pocket 116 behind or in front of the soft
body armor. The ballistic frame includes a body configured to improving overall load carriage
performance of the front carrier pocket 116 and the female tactical vest 100 by providing a rigid
platform to add weight. The frame body further reduces fatigue by improving the structure of
the female tactical vest 100 by retaining the soft body armor in a configuration that prevents
bunching and provides support to the ballistic hard plate to improve edge hit protection. The
ballistic frame is loose from or otherwise unattached to the soft body armor within the front
carrier pocket 116. The ballistic frame absorbs and otherwise dissipates energy from an impact
of a projectile against the ballistic hard plate and/or the soft body armor. It will be appreciated
that such protective devices are exemplary only and that other protective devices may be
included in addition or as an alternative to these protective devices.
[0026] In one implementation, the back carrier 104 includes a releasable back panel 118, which
may be used to releasably connect to or otherwise secure one or more protective devices and/or
to integrate with other tactical devices. The back carrier 104 may include a back carrier pocket
within, adjacent to, or in place of the releasable back panel 118 to receive and hold one or more
protective devices. In one implementation, the releasable back panel 118 is releasably engaged
to the back carrier 104 with a zipper assembly 156.
[0027] The front carrier 102 is connected to the back carrier 104 at a proximal end and/or a
distal end. In one implementation, the front carrier 102 is connected to the back carrier 104 at
the distal end with a cummerbund having a first cummerbund portion 120 and a second
cummerbund portion 122. It will be appreciated, however, that a belt, straps, or other side
connections may supplement or be used in place of the cummerbund. One or more of the
cummerbund sections 120 and 122 may be connected to the front carrier 102 using a

                                                   6
cummerbund buckle 128. In one implementation, the cummerbund sections 120 and 122 are
connected to the front carrier 102 at a first side pocket 124 and a second pocket 126,
respectively.
[0028] In one implementation, the front carrier 102 is connected to the back carrier 104 at the
proximal end with shoulder portions, including a first shoulder strap 150 and a second shoulder
strap 152. The shoulder straps 150 and 152 may each be adjustable. For example, the first
shoulder strap 150 and the second shoulder strap 152 may loop through a first shoulder buckle
142 and a second shoulder buckle 144 forming an adjustment portion 130 and 132, respectively.
The adjustment portions 130 and 132 may be secured, for example, using paired hook and loop
fasteners. In one implementation, the shoulder portions include a first shoulder pad 134 and a
second shoulder pad 136 with a low to enhance comfort and provide additional load distribution.
[0029] The female tactical vest 100 may include a cutaway system permitting single-handed
release. In one implementation, the cutaway system includes a plurality of buckles, which when
released permit the female tactical vest 100 to be easily and quickly removed. The plurality of
buckles may include, for example, the shoulder buckles 142 and 144 and the cummerbund
buckle(s) 128. In one implementation, the plurality of buckles are connected to a quick-release
tab 146 via corresponding wires. When the quick-release tab 146 is pulled, each of the plurality
of buckles is automatically disengaged, facilitating the removal of the female tactical vest 100.
The cutaway system may be reengaged and the female tactical vest 100 reassembled by
reengaging the plurality of buckles. In one implementation, the wires are housed within an
interior of the female tactical vest 100 and in communication with the buckles using one or more
pockets or openings. For example, the first side pocket 124 and a second pocket 126 may cover
at least a portion of the cummerbund buckle(s) 128 and provide access to the wires. Similarly,
the upper portion 106 of the front carrier 102 may include a first buckle pocket 138 and a second
buckle pocket 140 providing access to the wires for the first shoulder buckle 142 and the second
shoulder buckle 144, respectively.
[0030] Referring to Figures 4-6, in one implementation, the front carrier 102 includes an outer
surface 160 and an inner surface 162 forming an interior 158 therebetween, which may house
one or more protective devices, such as a soft ballistic armor. The outer surface 160 of the front
carrier 102 is exposed to an outside environment and is distal from the inner surface 162 to the
wearer of the female tactical vest 100. Stated differently, the inner surface 162 faces the wearer

                                                   7
and the outer surface 160 faces away from the wearer. In one implementation, the outer surface
160 is made from a lightweight hybrid material with superior abrasion, tear, and fire resistance
characteristics, while providing load carriage support and improved durability, particularly in
high-wear areas, such as corners, edges, seams, and exposed areas. The lightweight hybrid
material of the outer surface 160 may be, for example, a laminate of 500-denier nylon and 200
400-denier para-aramid fibers in an ultra-tight weave. In one implementation, the inner surface
162 includes a padder spacer mesh 164 attached thereto to enhance comfort. An outer surface
166 of the back carrier 104 and other outer facing surfaces of the female tactical vest 100 may
be made from similar materials to the outer surface 160 of the front carrier 102, and the back
carrier 104 may include a padder spacer mesh 168 similar to the padded spacer mesh 164 of the
front carrier 102. The padded spacer meshes 164 and 168 may be made from a material that is
antimicrobial and fire resistant treated.
[0031] For a detailed description of the carrier female shape of the front carrier 102, reference is
made to Figure 7. The carrier female shape is formed by the upper portion 106, the set of lateral
portions 108, and the lower portion 110. In one implementation, the upper portion 106 includes
a set of arms configured to releasably engage the shoulder portions. The set of arms each have
an upper side edge 200 extending distally from a top edge 202. The upper side edges 200 may
further extend along a contour to enhance ergonomics and accommodate the anatomy of a
female wearer. For example, the upper side edges 200 may each extend inwardly from the top
edge 202 in a direction generally towards a central axis extending from the proximal end of the
female tactical vest 100 to the distal end. The set of arms in the upper portion 106 are connected
by a center edge 214, which may be a contoured. In one implementation, the center edge 214
contours distally from each of the top edges 202 until reaching a central point.
[0032] The set of arms of the upper portion 106 are each connected to a respective lateral
portion 108. In one implementation, the upper side edge 200 of each of the upper arms is
connected to the lateral portion 108 at an upper valley 204. An edge of each of the lateral
portions 108 extends from the upper valley 204 in a direction generally outwardly away from
the central axis of the female tactical vest 100 to a lower valley 208. In one implementation,
each of the lateral portions 108 includes a lateral peak 206. The edge of each of the lateral
portions 108 may include a first edge extending from the upper valley 204 to the lateral peak
206 and a second edge extending from the lateral peak 206 to the lower valley 208. The first
edge, lateral peak 206, and the second edge may extend outwardly at angle along a line, forming

                                                  8
a generally straight line angling from the upper valley 204 to the lower valley 208. In another
implementation, the first edge contours from the upper valley 204 to the lateral peak 206, and
the second edge contours from the lower valley 208 to the lateral peak 206. Each of the lateral
portions 108 may include lateral darts extending from the edge of the lateral portion 108
inwardly and distally.
[0033] The lower portion 110 is connected to the upper portion 106 with the set of lateral
portions 108. In one implementation, the lower valleys 208 of the lateral portions 108 connect
to a set of outwardly extending edges 210 of the lower portion 110. Stated differently, the
lower valley 208 connects the second edge of the lateral portion 108 to the outwardly extending
edge 210. The outwardly extending edges 210 may each be disposed at an angle relative to
lower side edges 212 of the lower portion 110 and extend outwardly from the lower valleys 208
to the lower side edges 212. In one implementation, the lower side edges 212 each extend
distally from the outwardly extending edges 210 to a bottom edge 224, which may extend
horizontally between the lower side edges 212.
[0034] The front carrier pocket 116 is disposed on the outer surface 160 of the front carrier 102,
with the front carrier 102 shaped and otherwise configured to distribute the load of carried by
the front carrier pocket 116 while promoting comfort by accommodating the female anatomy, as
described herein. In one implementation, the front carrier pocket 116 includes a pocket top edge
216 disposed opposite a pocket bottom edge 226. A first pocket side edge 218 and a second
pocket side edge 222 connect the pocket top edge 216 to the pocket bottom edge 226. In one
implementation, the first pocket side edge 218 is connected to the second pocket side edge 222
at a pocket peak 220, with the first pocket side edge connecting the pocket top edge 216 to the
pocket peak and the second pocket side edge 222 connecting the pocket bottom edge 226 to the
pocket peak 220. The first pocket side edge 218 may be disposed at an angle relative to the
second pocket side edge 222.
[0035] Referring to Figures 8 and 9, as described herein, the front carrier 102 may be connected
to the back carrier 104 with a plurality of buckles, such as the shoulder buckles 142 and 144 and
the cummerbund buckles 128. In one implementation, each of the buckles are connected to a
cutaway system via one or more wires to release the buckles upon pulling of the quick-release
tab 146. For example, The cummerbund buckle 128 may include a female buckle portion 300
and a male buckle portion 302. The female buckle portion 300 includes an opening 304 adapted

                                                 9
to receive a body of the male buckle portion 302 and slots 306 to releasably engage buckle arms
310 of the male buckle portion 302. In one implementation, a releasing member 308 is
connected to a wire of the cutaway system and configured to displace the buckle arms 310.
When the quick-release tab 146 is pulled, the wires of the cutaway system are displaced, which
displaces the releasing member 308 and in turn the buckle arms 310, thereby disengaging the
male buckle portion 302 from the female buckle portion 300. In one implementation, the male
buckle portion 302 is disposed within an interior of the first side pocket 124 formed by an outer
layer 312 and an inner layer 314. The shoulder buckles 142 and 144 may include similar
features and functionality.
[0036] As can be understood from Figures 10 and 11, in one implementation, a soft ballistic
armor 400 formed from one or more panels 408 has an armor female shape mirroring the carrier
female shape of the front carrier 102. The soft ballistic armor 400 may be disposed within the
interior 158 of the front carrier 102. In one implementation, the armor female shape of the soft
ballistic armor 400 is formed from an upper portion 402, a set of lateral portions 404 and a lower
portion 406. The set of lateral portions 404 connect the upper portion 402 to the lower portion
406.
[0037] In one implementation, the upper portion 402 includes a set of upper side edges 416 each
extending distally from a top edge 414. The upper side edges 416 may further extend along a
contour to enhance ergonomics and accommodate the anatomy of a female wearer. For
example, the upper side edges 416 may each extend inwardly from the top edge 414 in a
direction generally towards a central axis 508 extending from a proximal end of the soft ballistic
armor 400 to a distal end. The top edges 414 are connected by a center edge 410, which may be
a contoured. In one implementation, the center edge 410 contours distally from each of the top
edges 414 until reaching a central point. The top edges 414 may contour from the upper side
edges 416 into the center edge 410.
[0038] In one implementation, each of the upper side edges 416 is connected to the lateral
portion 404 at an upper valley 418. An edge of each of the lateral portions 404 extends from the
upper valley 418 in a direction generally outwardly away from the central axis 508 to a lower
valley 422. In one implementation, each of the lateral portions 404 includes a lateral peak 420.
The edge of each of the lateral portions 404 may include a first edge extending from the upper
valley 418 to the lateral peak 420 and a second edge extending from the lateral peak 420 to the

                                                  10
lower valley 422. The first edge, lateral peak 420, and the second edge may extend outwardly at
angle along a line, forming a generally straight line angling from the upper valley 418 to the
lower valley 422. In another implementation, the first edge contours from the upper valley 418
to the lateral peak 420, and the second edge contours from the lower valley 422 to the lateral
peak 420.
[0039] The lower portion 406 is connected to the upper portion 402 with the set of lateral
portions 404. In one implementation, the lower valleys 422 of the lateral portions 404 connect
to a set of outwardly extending edges 424 of the lower portion 406. Stated differently, the
lower valley 422 connects the second edge of the lateral portion 404 to the outwardly extending
edge 424. The outwardly extending edges 424 may each be disposed at an angle relative to
lower side edges 426 of the lower portion 406 and extend outwardly from the lower valleys 422
to the lower side edges 426. In one implementation, the lower side edges 426 each extend
distally from the outwardly extending edges 424 to a bottom edge 412, which may extend
horizontally between the lower side edges 426.
[0040] Each of the lateral portions 404 may include lateral darts extending from the edge of the
lateral portion 404 inwardly and distally. In one implementation, the lateral darts form cup
portions 428. As can be understood in Figure 11, the lateral darts are each adapted to displace a
ballistic hard plate 500 to eliminate excess compression on the breast tissue of the female
wearer. More particularly, the ballistic hard plate 500 includes a body 502 having a strike face
506 and a back face 504. The lateral darts displace a proximal end the body 502 ballistic hard
plate 500 in a direction away from the inner surface 162 of the front carrier 102 and the soft
ballistic armor 400 (i.e., a direction away from the wearer). As such, a central axis 510 of the
hard ballistic plate 500 is disposed at an angle relative to the central axis 508 of the soft ballistic
armor 400.
[0041] Turning to Figure 12, in one implementation, the one or more panels 408 includes a first
panel 600 having one or more layers and a second panel 602 having one or more layers. The
first panel 600 includes an inner surface 604 and the second panel 602 has an inner surface 606.
In one implementation, the lateral darts are each formed from one or more raised pleats. For
example, a first raised pleat 608 may be formed along the inner surface 604 of the first panel
600, and a second raised pleat 610 may be formed along the inner surface 606 of the second
panel 602. The raised pleats 608 and 610 may each extend from a center area 612 of a

                                                    11
respective cup portion 428 to a periphery 616. In one implementation, the raised pleats 608 and
610 form free space 614 of the cup portion 428 between the first panel 600 and the second panel
602. The raised pleats 608 and 610 may each be formed using a plurality of sewing lines
extending from the center area 612 to the periphery 616. In one implementation, the lateral
darts formed from the raised pleats 608 and 610 extend from the center area 612 to an edge of
the lateral portion 404 of the soft ballistic armor 400 disposed between the upper valley 418 and
the lower valley 422. After the raised pleats 608 and 610 are formed, the first panel 600 may be
attached to the second panel 602, for example, using sewing, lamination (e.g., with an adhesive,)
to form the soft ballistic armor 400.
[0042] Figure 13 illustrates example operations 700 for manufacturing a female tactical vest. In
one implementation, an operation 702 forms a front carrier having an upper portion connected to
a lower portion with opposing lateral darts. An operation 704 forms a first panel from a
plurality of layers of ballistic material. An operation 706 stitches a plurality of sewing lines
along the first panel to form a first set of raised pleats, which may include one or more raised
