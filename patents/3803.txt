TECHNICAL FIELD
  [0002]    The present disclosure is directed generally to dehumidifiers, assemblies,
  and methods, and more specifically, to dehumidifiers with improved airflow and fluid
  management features.
BACKGROUND
  [0003]    Dehumidifiers are used for removing moisture from air. A conventional
  dehumidifier typically directs airflow across several components of a refrigeration
  cycle. The components of the refrigeration cycle cool the airflow below the dew
  point temperature so that water vapor in the airflow is condensed to liquid and
  removed from the airflow. Dehumidifiers are useful in many different applications.
  For example, dehumidifiers are frequently used in residential applications to reduce
  the level of humidity in the air for health reasons, as humid air can cause unwanted
  mold or mildew to grow inside homes.             Moreover, many homeowners operate
  dehumidifiers to decrease the humidity of the air in their homes for comfort reasons,
  as extremely humid air can be uncomfortable. Dehumidifiers are also frequently
  used in commercial or industrial applications, for example to dry the air in water
  damage restoration projects.      The drier air helps contractors restore buildings or
  other structures that have been flooded or suffered other types of water damage.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
  [0013]    The present disclosure is directed generally to dehumidifiers with improved
  airflow and fluid management features, and associated methods of manufacture and
  operation, for removing water or other fluids (e.g., liquids) from buildings or other
  structures.   The following description identifies specific details with reference to
  Figures 1-4C to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the
  disclosure.    Other details describing well-known structures or processes often
  associated with dehumidifiers, however, are not described below to avoid
  unnecessarily obscuring the description of various embodiments of the disclosure.
  Moreover, although the following disclosure sets forth several embodiments of
  different aspects of the disclosure, other embodiments can have different
  configurations and/or different components than those described in this section. In
  addition, further embodiments of the disclosure may be practiced without several of
                                               -2-

WO 2013/033440                                                     PCT/US2012/053199
the details described below, while still other embodiments of the disclosure may be
practiced with additional details and/or features.
[0014]     The present disclosure is directed generally to dehumidifiers having
improved airflow and fluid management features. Figure 1A, for example, is a front
isometric view and Figure 1B is a rear isometric view of a dehumidifier 100
configured in accordance with one embodiment of the disclosure.              Referring to
Figures 1A and 1B together, the dehumidifier 100 includes a cover or housing 102.
The housing is composed of three coupled pieces or portions: a first or lower
housing portion 104, a second or upper housing portion 106, and a third or rear
housing portion 108. The lower housing portion 104 is additionally coupled to a
support structure or frame 103 (Figure 1B). The housing 102 is configured to allow
air to flow through the dehumidifier 100. For example, the upper housing portion
106 defines or carries an inlet (or a housing entrance) 110 and the lower housing
portion 104 defines or carries an outlet (or a housing exit) 112 (Figure 1A). An air
mover 114 (Figure 1A) positioned at the outlet 112 draws inlet airflow into the
dehumidifier 100 at the inlet 110.          Intermediate airflow travels through the
dehumidifier 100 to pass through,           adjacent   to, or otherwise       in thermal
communication with one or more moisture removing components.               The air mover
114 discharges outlet airflow from the dehumidifier 100 via the outlet 112 of the
lower housing portion 104. Additional details of the moisture removing components
and the airflow through the dehumidifier 100 are described in detail below with
reference to Figure 2.
[0015]     In a particular embodiment illustrated in Figures 1A and 11B, the
dehumidifier 100 also includes a shroud or screen 116 removably attached to the
upper housing portion 106. The screen 116 retains a filter (not visible in Figures 1A
and 1B) at the inlet 110 of the upper housing portion 106 and includes a plurality of
openings to allow the air to flow through the filter. The filter can include any suitable
filter medium for use with a dehumidifier to at least partially prevent dust, debris, or
other foreign objects from entering the dehumidifier 100. In certain embodiments,
the screen 116 and filter can be removable from the upper housing portion 106. The
rear housing portion 108 also carries a control panel 120 (Figure 1B) including one
or more electronic controls to allow a user to operate the dehumidifier 100.
                                            -3-

WO 2013/033440                                                    PCT/US2012/053199
[0016]     The dehumidifier 100 further includes wheels 118 (identified individually as
a first wheel 11 8a and a second wheel 11 8b) extending from the support structure
103. The wheels 118 are designed to allow a user to easily move the dehumidifier
100 to different desired locations. The dehumidifier 100 shown in Figures 1A and
1B can accordingly be a portable dehumidifier that a single user can easily roll or
otherwise move.      In the illustrated embodiment, the lower housing portion 104 is
shaped to generally follow the contour of the wheels 118. In other embodiments,
however, the lower housing portion 104 can extend between the wheels 118 and the
support structure 103, or the lower housing portion 104 can at least partially extend
around and enclose the wheels 118. As will also be appreciated by one of ordinary
skill in the relevant art, the dehumidifier 100 illustrated in Figures 1A and 1B can
include any type of dehumidifier, including, for example, a portable, commercial,
industrial, residential, and/or personal dehumidifier.
[0017J     Figure 2 is a cross-sectional side view of the dehumidifier 100 taken
substantially along lines 2-2 of Figure 1A illustrating several of the internal features
of the dehumidifier 100.        For example, the dehumidifier 100 includes several
moisture removing components that form elements of a refrigeration cycle for
removing moisture from air flowing through the dehumidifier 100.          In a particular
embodiment, the dehumidifier 100 includes a compressor 224 that delivers a hot
compressed gas refrigerant to a condenser 226. The condenser 226 can include a
tube-and-fin heat exchanger and/or coils.         In the illustrated embodiment, the
condenser 226 includes multiple rows or series of coiled condenser tubing 227. In
the illustrated embodiment, for example, the condenser 226 includes four rows or
series of coiled condenser tubing 227.          In other embodiments, however, the
condenser 226 can include more or fewer than four rows of coiled condenser tubing
227. The hot compressed gas flows through the coiled condenser tubing 227 and
the condenser 226 condenses the hot gas refrigerant to a hot liquid refrigerant and
delivers the hot liquid refrigerant to an expansion device (not shown).              The
expansion device can cool and/or expand the hot liquid refrigerant to reduce the
temperature and pressure of the refrigerant.       The expansion device delivers the
cooled refrigerant to a moisture removal device or evaporator 228. The evaporator
228 can include a tube-and-fin heat exchanger and/or coils.           In the illustrated
embodiment, the evaporator 228 also includes multiple rows or series of coiled
                                            -4-

WO 2013/033440                                                   PCT/US2012/053199
evaporator tubing 229. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the evaporator
228 includes four rows or series of coiled evaporator tubing 229.              In other
embodiments, however, the evaporator 228 can include more or fewer than four
rows of evaporator tubing 229. As the cooled liquid refrigerant moves through the
evaporator coiled tubing 229, the evaporator 228 evaporates the cooled gas
refrigerant. The evaporator 228 returns the cooled gas refrigerant to the compressor
224 to complete the refrigeration cycle. Accordingly, the tubing 229 forms a portion
of a refrigerant loop that passes through the foregoing components.
[0018]     The dehumidifier 100 also includes a heat exchanger 230 adjacent to each
of the evaporator 228 and the condenser 226. The heat exchanger 230 can include
an air-to-air heat exchanger, a heat exchanger block, or a so-called "x-block." In the
illustrated embodiment, the heat exchanger 230 includes multiple separate airflow
channels or passages (not shown) that are aligned with each of the evaporator 228
and the condenser 226. The heat exchanger 230 is configured to transfer heat to
and from air flowing through the dehumidifier 100, in addition to the heat transfer
from the evaporator 228 and the condenser 226. For example, the dehumidifier 100
includes an airflow path 232 along which airflow can travel through the dehumidifier
100. The airflow path 232 enters the upper housing portion 106 at the inlet (or the
housing entrance) 110 and continues through the heat exchanger 230 to the
evaporator 228 in a first direction (e.g., in a generally vertical direction when the
dehumidifier 100 is positioned as shown in Figure 2). At this portion of the airflow
path 232 (i.e., passing through the heat exchanger 230 in the first direction and
through the evaporator 228), the heat exchanger 230 and the evaporator 228 cool
the airflow to remove moisture from the airflow.
[0019J     After exiting the evaporator 228 at an evaporator exit 251, interior walls or
sections of the lower housing portion 104 and the upper housing portion 106 redirect
the airflow path 232 back through the heat exchanger 230 in a second direction
generally perpendicular to the first direction toward the condenser 236 (e.g., in a
generally horizontal direction when the dehumidifier 100 is positioned as shown in
Figure 2). At this portion of the airflow path 232 (i.e., passing through the heat
exchanger 230 in the second direction and through the condenser 226), the heat
exchanger 230 and the condenser 226 heat the airflow. After exiting the condenser
                                           -5-

WO 2013/033440                                                       PCT/US2012/053199
226 at a condenser exit 252, interior walls or sections of the housing 102 redirect the
airflow path 232 through the lower housing portion 104 to exit the housing 102 via
the outlet 112 in the lower housing portion 104. The air mover 114 (e.g., a shrouded
impeller, blower, or other suitable air mover) is positioned at the outlet 112 to draw
airflow through the dehumidifier 100 along the airflow path 232.
[0020]     The dehumidifier 100 illustrated in Figure 2 includes several features that
alter the airflow path 232 through the dehumidifier 100 for enhanced moisture
removal by the moisture removal components. For example, the dehumidifier 100
includes one or more evaporator airflow directors 236 (identified individually as a first
evaporator airflow director 236a and a second evaporator airflow director 236b).
The evaporator airflow directors 236 can be plates or flanges that are positioned on
opposing front and rear lateral sides of the evaporator 228.          For example, in the
illustrated embodiment the second evaporator airflow director 236b includes a flange
or extension portion 235. The extension portion 235 extends at an angle from the
second evaporator airflow director 236b toward the front of the dehumidifier 100,
and in a direction extending generally under a rear portion of the evaporator 228
(e.g., at an angle generally extending downwardly and to the left from the evaporator
airflow director 236b shown in Figure 2). The evaporator airflow directors 236, and
corresponding flanges such as the extension portion 235, generally cover or enclose
opposing lateral sides of the evaporator 228. The evaporator airflow directors 236
extend along the sides of the evaporator 228 in corresponding planes that are
generally parallel to the direction of the first portion of the airflow path 232 entering
the evaporator 228. Moreover, in the illustrated embodiment each evaporator airflow
director 236 spans or extends across all of the corresponding rows or series of the
coiled evaporator tubing 229.      In other embodiments, however, each evaporator
airflow director 236 can span or extend across only a portion of the corresponding
rows or series of the coiled evaporator tubing 229. The evaporator airflow directors
236 can be made from metallic, plastic, or other suitable materials for directing
airflow or otherwise influencing the airflow path 232 through the evaporator 228.
[0021]     The dehumidifier 100 illustrated in Figure 2 also includes one or more
condenser airflow directors 238 (identified individually as a first condenser airflow
director 238a and a second condenser airflow director 238b). The condenser airflow
                                             -6-

WO 2013/033440                                                     PCT/US2012/053199
directors 238 can be plates or flanges that are positioned on opposing upper and
lower sides of the condenser 226. In particular embodiments, the condenser airflow
directors 238 generally cover or enclose the opposing sides of the condenser 226.
The condenser airflow directors 238 extend along the sides of the condenser 226 in
corresponding planes that are generally parallel to the direction of the second
portion of the airflow path 232 entering the condenser 226. As shown in Figure 2,
each condenser airflow director 238 spans or extends across all of the
corresponding rows or series of the coiled condenser tubing 227.                 In other
embodiments, however, each condenser airflow director 238 can span or extend
across only a portion of the corresponding rows or series of the coiled condenser
tubing 227. The condenser airflow directors 238 can be made from metallic, plastic,
or other suitable materials for directing airflow or otherwise influencing the airflow
path 232 through the condenser 226.
[0022]     In operation, as air travels through the dehumidifier 100 along the airflow
path 232, the evaporator airflow directors 236 and the condenser airflow directors
238 increase the amount of air that passes through the evaporator coils 229 and the
condenser coils 227, respectively.       In a conventional device, as airflow passes
through the dehumidifier 100, and in particular through the evaporator 228 or the
condenser 226, the airflow has the tendency to take the path of least resistance.
For example, airflowing through the evaporator 228 may exit the evaporator 228
before passing through all of the rows or series of evaporator coils 229, as illustrated
by arrow 233 (shown in broken lines). In the present embodiment, however, the
evaporator airflow directors 236 are positioned relative to the evaporator 228 to force
or otherwise direct the airflow through all or most of the evaporator coils 229 before
allowing the airflow to exit the evaporator 228. For instance, the second evaporator
airflow director 236b is positioned at a rear lateral side of the evaporator 228 and at
least partially covers, blocks, or otherwise encloses the rear portion of the
evaporator 228. In this manner, the second evaporator airflow director 236b blocks
the airflow represented by broken arrow 233. For example, the second evaporator
airflow director 236b can ensure that air flowing through the rear portion of the
evaporator 228 passes through all of the evaporator coils 229 before exiting the rear
portion of the evaporator 228, as represented by arrow 240 indicating redirected
airflow adjacent to the second evaporator airflow director 236b. The first evaporator
                                            -7-

WO 2013/033440                                                   PCT/US2012/053199
airflow director 236a similarly ensures that air flowing through the forward portion of
the evaporator 228 does not prematurely exit the forward portion of the evaporator
228 before passing through all of the rows of evaporator coils 229.
[0023]     The condenser airflow directors 238 control or redirect the air flowing
through the condenser 226 in a manner that is generally similar to that of the
evaporator airflow directors 236.       For example, the second condenser airflow
director 238b is positioned at a lower side of the condenser 226 to force or otherwise
direct the airflow through all or most of the condenser coils 227 before allowing the
airflow to exit the condenser 226. As such, the second condenser airflow director
238b can eliminate or at least partially reduce airflow that would otherwise
prematurely exit the lower portion of the condenser 226 as illustrated by arrow 231
(shown in broken lines). Accordingly, the first condenser airflow director 238a can
ensure that air flowing through the upper portion of the condenser 226 does not
prematurely exit the upper portion of the condenser 226 before passing through all
the rows of the condenser coils 227.
[0024] The evaporator airflow directors 236 and the condenser airflow directors
238 described above can provide the advantage of increasing the efficiency of the
dehumidifier 100 performance.       For example, these airflow directors can increase
the amount of airflow, as well as the dwell time of the airflow, that passes through
the evaporator coils 229 and/or the condenser coils 227. This in turn increases the
heat transfer to the airflow from the dehumidifier 100, thereby increasing the
moisture removal from the airflow.
[0025]     Another feature of an embodiment illustrated in Figure 2 is that the
compressor 224 is positioned in the lower housing portion 104 in a heated segment
or relatively warmer portion of the airflow path 232. For example, as air passes
through the condenser 226, the condenser 226 heats the airflow. The heated airflow
then passes into the lower housing portion 104 before exiting the outlet 112 via the
air mover 114. The compressor 224, however, is positioned in-line or in the path of
the heated airflow in the lower housing portion 104 downstream from the condenser
226. Positioning the compressor 224 at this location provides several advantages
for increasing the efficiency of the dehumidifier 100. One advantage, for example, is
that the compressor 224 does not have direct thermal communication with airflow
                                            -8-

WO 2013/033440                                                    PCT/US2012/053199
flowing through the refrigeration system (e.g., from the inlet 110 through the heat
exchanger 230 to the evaporator 228, and then from the evaporator through the heat
exchanger 230 to the condenser 226; see Figure 2). For example, the position of
the compressor 224 in the lower housing portion 104 provides thermal separation
between the compressor 224 and the heat exchanger 230, evaporator 228 and
condenser 226 in the upper housing portion 102. Another advantage, for example,
is that although the compressor 224 generates heat during operation, transferring
additional heat to the airflow from the compressor 224 enhances or further adds to
the heat that the condenser 226 previously added to the airflow. This additional heat
added to the airflow from the compressor can be useful in situations where the
airflow exiting the dehumidifier 100 is used to dry a flooring surface or other
environment. For example, in some embodiments the airflow exiting the outlet 112
of the dehumidifier 100 can be directed to further dry a portion of a flooring surface
or otherwise warm the environment where the dehumidifier 100 is being used. In
these instances, the compressor 224 can accordingly further heat the exiting airflow
to raise the temperature         of the airflow and thereby increase the drying
characteristics of the exiting airflow.
[0026]     In the illustrated embodiment, the housing 102 also provides several
beneficial features for managing the fluid that is extracted from the air flowing
through the dehumidifier. For instance, the lower housing portion 104 includes an
integrally formed fluid collector portion or drip tray 242.       The drip tray 242 is
positioned below the evaporator 228 and is configured to collect or catch the fluid
that the evaporator 228 removes from the air.       Forming the drip tray 242 as an
integral section of the lower housing portion 104 provides several benefits. One
advantage, for example, is that the integral drip tray 242 eliminates or reduces any
leaks from the collected fluid that may otherwise occur at an interface of two or more
mating components that may be joined to form a drip tray. As also noted above, the
lower housing portion 104 redirects the airflow path 232 from the evaporator 228 to
the heat exchanger 230. The integral drip tray 242 can eliminate or at least partially
reduce airflow leaks when redirecting this portion of the airflow path 232 downstream
from the evaporator 228. Other advantages of the integral drip tray 242 include the
reduced manufacturing and assembly time associated with this portion of the
dehumidifier 100, and/or a reduced component cost. An additional advantage of
                                           -9-

WO 2013/033440                                                   PCT/US2012/053199
forming the drip tray 242 as an integral section of the lower housing portion 104 is
that the integral drip tray 242 increases the stiffness and strength of the lower
housing portion 104, as well as of the overall housing 102. The increased stiffness
and strength of the lower housing portion 104 and housing 102 is beneficial because
the lower housing portion 104, as well as the upper housing portion 106 and the rear
housing portion 108, are used as load bearing support structures for the
dehumidifier 100.
[0027]     In the illustrated embodiment, the drip tray 242 includes an upper surface
that angles downwardly towards the rear of the dehumidifier 100. The angled drip
tray 242 accordingly directs the collected fluid towards the rear portion of the
dehumidifier 100. According to an additional feature of the illustrated embodiment,
the rear housing portion 108 includes a collection compartment or pump cavity 244.
The pump compartment or cavity 244 is an integrally formed section of the rear
housing portion 108 and is configured to house a pump 246 (e.g., a condensate
pump, submersible or partially submersible pump, or other suitable pump or pump
assembly). Accordingly, the pump compartment 244 can form a structural element
that supports the housing 102 (e.g., the rear housing portion 108 and/or other
housing portions). An advantage of this arrangement is that the pump compartment
244 can provide multiple functions and reduce or eliminate the need for other water
collecting, water holding, or general structural elements in the housing 102. The
pump cavity 244 is further positioned to receive the collected fluid from the drip tray
242. More specifically, for example, a fluid connector 248 couples the drip tray 242
to the pump cavity 244 to transport the collected fluid from the drip tray 242 to the
pump cavity 244. As the pump cavity 244 fills with collected fluid, the pump 246 can
discharge the fluid from the housing 102, e.g., when the fluid reaches a
predetermined      volume or at predetermined        time intervals during operation.
Additional features and advantages of the rear housing portion 108 and the integral
pump cavity 244 are described below with reference to Figure 3C.
[0028]     In certain embodiments the fluid connector 248 can have an elongated,
looped, or otherwise redirected configuration to heat the fluid passing through the
fluid connector 248 prior to dispensing the fluid in the pump cavity 244. For example,
the fluid connector 248 can have one or more loops or extensions that pass through
                                           -10-

WO 2013/033440                                                    PCT/US2012/053199
the lower housing portion 104 before connecting to the pump cavity 244 at the rear
housing portion 108. As explained above, the interior of the lower housing portion
104 is at least partially heated by the airflow entering the lower housing portion 104
from the condenser 226.        The compressor 224 additionally generates heat that
raises the temperature in the interior of the lower housing portion 104. Accordingly,
passing at least a portion of the fluid connector 248 through the lower housing
portion 104, and in particular proximate to the compressor 224, can raise the
temperature of the fluid passing through the fluid connector 248. The inventors have
found, for example, that in certain embodiments redirecting the fluid connector 248
through the lower housing portion 104 in this manner can raise the temperature of
the fluid flowing through the fluid connector 248 by approximately 10-15 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[0029]     One advantage of at least partially heating the collected fluid prior to
dispensing the collected fluid into the pump cavity 244 is that it can reduce
condensation. For example, dispensing relatively cold fluid (e.g., at or near the dew
point temperature of the fluid) into the pump cavity 244 of a conventional
dehumidifier may cause condensation to form on an outer surface of the housing
102.     Such condensation can in turn drip from the housing 102 leaving an
undesirable puddle of fluid or other impression that the dehumidifier 100 is leaking.
In the illustrated embodiment, however, the fluid collected from the drip tray 242 can
be at least partially heated in the fluid connector 248 before the fluid connector 248
dispenses the fluid in the pump cavity 244. Heating the collected fluid in the lower
housing portion 104 away from an exterior surface of the housing 102 can
accordingly reduce the likelihood of forming condensation on an exterior surface of
the rear housing portion 108.
[0030]     Figure 3A is an exploded view of an embodiment of the housing 102 of the
dehumidifier 100 described above with reference to Figures 1A-2 illustrating the first
or lower housing portion 104, the second or upper housing portion 106, and the third
or rear housing portion 108.       When assembled, these housing portions can be
attached to each other and/or the frame 103 (Figure 1B) via suitable fasteners and
with accompanying sealing features (e.g., foam, gaskets, seals, etc.) as are known
by those of ordinary skill in the art, In the illustrated embodiment, each of the lower

housing portion 104, the upper housing portion 106, and the rear housing portion
108 can be formed or made as separate, integral units. Moreover, these housing
portions can be made from plastic materials, such as rotomolded thermoplastics, or
other suitable materials.
[0031]     Figure 3B is a cross-sectional side view of the lower housing portion 104
taken substantially along lines 3B-3B of Figure 3A. Referring to Figures 3A and 3B
together, the lower housing portion 104 defines an interior cavity 350 for housing
several of the dehumidifier internal components, such as the compressor 224
(Figure 2), air mover 114 (Figure 2), and associated components.              The lower
housing portion 104 further defines the outlet 112 through which airflow exits the
dehumidifier 100.     In certain embodiments, the lower housing portion 104 can
include one or more airflow directors that are integral features of the lower housing
portion 104. For example, such integral features of the lower housing portion 104
can form an inlet for the air mover 114 (Figure 2) that is positioned within the lower
housing portion 104. Forming an air mover inlet as an integral feature of the lower
housing portion 104 can reduce the manufacturing and assembly time and cost
associated with the lower housing portion.
[0032]     As also shown in illustrated embodiment, the drip tray 242 is an integral
feature of the lower housing portion 104. As noted above, the integral drip tray 242
provides several benefits including, for example, an increased strength and stiffness
of the lower housing portion 104. In the illustrated embodiment, the drip tray 242
slopes or is angled downwardly and toward the rear of the dehumidifier 100 (e.g.,
down and to the left in the orientation shown in Figure 3B) when the dehumidifier
100 is in an operating position to accumulate the collected fluid at a drip tray
coupling 352. The drip tray coupling 352 is located at a low spot or depression 354
in the drip tray 242 to ensure that the collected fluid accumulates at the drip tray
coupling 352. Moreover, the drip tray coupling 352 is configured to be coupled to
the fluid connector 248 to dispense the collected fluid into the pump cavity 244 of the
rear housing portion 108 (Figure 2). The drip tray coupling 352 can also be formed
as an integral portion of the drip tray 242 and the lower housing portion 104.

the lower housing portion 104 can accordingly eliminate or reduce any fluid leaks
associated with forming a connection to the drip tray 242.
[0033]     Figure 3C is a cross-sectional side view of the rear housing portion 108
taken substantially along lines 3C-3C of Figure 3A. Referring to Figures 3A and 3C
together, the rear housing portion 108 includes an intemal cavity 355 extending from
a first or lower section 356 of the rear housing portion 108 to a second or upper
portion 358 of the rear housing portion 108. The internal cavity 355 is composed of
multiple smaller cavities including the pump cavity 244 at the lower section 356, as
well as an upper cavity 357 at the upper section 358. As noted above, the pump
cavity 244 is configured to receive and support the pump 246 (Figure 2).            For
example, the rear housing portion 108 includes an opening 360 at the lower section
356 that provides access into the internal cavity 355 to allow the pump 246 to be
positioned within the pump cavity 244.         Moreover, the lower section 356 further
includes a pump support surface 362 (Figure 3C) positioned to receive and support
the pump 246 (Figure 2).
[0034]     In particular embodiments, the rear housing portion 108 is configured to
reduce or eliminate the leakage of fluid that accumulates in the pump cavity 244
from the drip tray 242 (Figure 2). For example, forming the pump cavity 244 and the
pump support surface 362 as integral sections of the rear housing portion 108
eliminates any connections (e.g., via seals, gaskets, etc.) that would be used to join
two or more parts to support a pump or define an enclosure to hold a pump. Other
features of the illustrated embodiment include an the internal cavity 355 having an
integral or uninterrupted interior rear surface extending from the lower section 356 to
the upper section 358 of the rear housing portion 108. In addition, the pump cavity
244 and the upper cavity 357 can have at least approximately the same or generally
similar volumes. As such, when a user moves the dehumidifier 100, for example by
pivoting the dehumidifier 100 via the rear wheels 118 (Figures 1A and 1B) in a
direction generally shown by arrow 361, fluid that is present in the pump cavity 244
does not spill or leak out of the internal cavity 355. For example, fluid contained
within the pump cavity 244 can transfer into the upper cavity 357 without leaking
from the rear housing portion 108 as the rear housing portion 108 pivots in the
direction of arrow 361.

WO 2013/033440                                                    PCT/US2012/053199
[0035]     The rear housing portion 108 can additionally include a channel 364
extending across at least the upper section 358 of the rear housing portion 108. The
channel 364 can be integrally formed with the rear housing portion 108 and can be
positioned to guide wires or connectors, such as low voltage connectors, that extend
between the control panel 120 (Figure 1B) and electrical components positioned
within the rear housing portion 108. Forming the channel 364 as an integral part of
the rear housing portion 108 provides a shield and/or waterproof protection for the
connectors extending through the channel 364. The rear housing portion 108 can
further include an integrally formed support or shelf 366 in the upper section 358 that
is configured to house one or more sensors for detecting the properties of air flowing
through the dehumidifier 100.
[0036]     Figure 3D is a cross-sectional side view of a lower housing portion of a
dehumidifier configured in accordance with a particular embodiment of the
disclosure. As shown in Figure 3D, the lower housing portion 104 of the housing
112 includes a drip tray 242. In the illustrated embodiment, the drip tray 242 can be
formed integrally with the lower housing portion 104. As noted above, the integral
drip tray 242 provides several benefits including, for example, an increased strength
and stiffness of the lower housing portion 104. As shown in Figure 3D, a spout 353
can be located at a low spot or depression 354 in the drip tray 242. The collected
fluid accumulates in the drip tray 242 and flows to the pump cavity 244 of the rear
housing portion 108 (Figure 2) via the spout 353. As the pump cavity 244 fills with
the collected fluid, the pump 246 can discharge the fluid from the housing 102. The
spout 353 can transfer collected fluid with impurities or other particles without
clogging. This can provide an additional advantage over embodiments that use the
flow connector 248 (e.g., a hose) to transfer water between the drip tray 242 and the
pump cavity 244 (e.g., a pump basin) by eliminating a component and the
associated time required to install and potentially maintain it.
[0037]     Figure 3E is a bottom isometric view of a dehumidifier lower housing
portion 104 configured in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. In the
illustrated embodiment, the spout 353 can be attached to the lower housing portion
104 by screws, bolts, or other suitable connectors. In other embodiments, the spout
353 can also be formed as an integral portion of the drip tray 242 and the lower
                                            -14-

housing portion 104. Forming the spout 353 as an integral feature of the drip tray
242 and the lower housing portion 104 can accordingly eliminate or reduce fluid
leaks associated with forming a connection to the drip tray 242.        This may also
reduce manufacturing costs.
[0038]     Figure 4A is an isometric view of a heat exchanger 230 of a dehumidifier
configured in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. As shown in Figure
4A, the heat exchanger 230 is positioned adjacent to the evaporator 228 and the
condenser 226. The airflow path 232 flows through the heat exchanger 230 (during
a pre-cool process) to the evaporator 228 in a first direction (e.g., D1 in Figure 4A)
and then flows through the heat exchanger 230 (during a pre-heat process) to the
condenser 226 in a second direction (e.g., D2 in Figure 4A). The two flow paths are
in thermal communication within the heat exchanger 230 but do not mix. In the
illustrated embodiment, the heat exchanger 230 can include a corner blocking
component 401 positioned at the corner of the heat exchanger 230. The corner
blocking component 401 can direct the airflow within the heat exchanger 230 and
prevent air from leaking, e.g., from one flow path to the other. The corner blocking
component 401 can be attached to the heat exchanger 230 by glue, adhesives, or
other suitable arrangements.      The heat exchanger 230 can have a notch 402 to
accommodate the corner blocking component 401. Additional aspects of the heat
exchanger 230 and the corner blocking component 401 are included in U.S.
Provisional Application No. 61/547,613, filed October 14, 2011, and previously
incorporated herein by reference.
[0039]     Figure 4B is an isometric view of a dehumidifier 400 configured in
accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.              Figure 4B shows the
dehumidifier 400 with the upper housing portion 106 (Figure 1A) removed so that the
heat exchanger 230 is visible. Figure 4C illustrates an enlarged portion of the heat
exchanger 230. As shown in Figure 4C, the heat exchanger 230 can include a first
corner blocking component 401a (generally similar to the blocking component 401
described above with reference to Figure 4A), and a second comer blocking
component 401b at another corner of the heat exchanger 230, to further direct the
airflow within the heat exchanger 230.       In addition, the second corner blocking
component 401b can prevent undesirable airflow leakage around the sides of the
                                          -15-

WO 2013/033440                                                      PCT/US2012/053199
heat exchanger 230, as indicated by arrow Li. In the illustrated embodiment, the
heat exchanger 230 can include a flexible T-shaped third blocking component 401c
positioned and shaped to direct the air flowing from the heat exchanger 230 to the
condenser 226. The third blocking component 401c can be made of any suitable
heat insulation material.    The third blocking component 401c can be positioned
between the heat exchanger 230 and the condenser 226 to create a substantially
airtight flow path for the passing airflow. In particular, the third blocking component
401c can prevent undesirable airflow leakage from the condenser 226 around the
side of the heat exchanger 230, as indicated by arrow L2.             The third blocking
component 401c can effectively prevent undesirable heat exchange between the
evaporator 228 (Figure 4B), which is at a relatively low temperature and the
condenser 226, which is at a relatively high temperature, in addition to or in lieu of
preventing or at least restricting airflow along the leak path, indicated by arrow L2.
The foregoing features alone or in combination can further improve the overall
efficiency of the dehumidifier 400.
[0040J      From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that specific embodiments of the
disclosure have been described herein for purposes of illustration, but that various
modifications may be made without deviating from the scope of the disclosure. For
example, although three separate housing portions are described above, in other
embodiments more or less housing portions may be combined to form the housing
or cover without deviating from the disclosure. In addition, aspects described in the
context of particular embodiments may be combined or eliminated in other
embodiments. Further, although advantages associated with certain embodiments
have been described in the context of those embodiments, other embodiments may
also exhibit such advantages, and not all embodiments need necessarily exhibit
such advantages to fall within the scope of the disclosure.             Accordingly, the
disclosure can include other embodiments not expressly shown or described above.
