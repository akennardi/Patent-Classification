Abstract
This invention relates to a pelmet comprising a self-assembly unit - with an 'L
shaped sleeve joiner [1] which serves several purposes.
i)     The pelmet package folds down into itself, by sliding into the hollow  ''
       shaped sheath for packaging and transport.
ii)    The invention allows the pelmet to fit more than the one-sized window
       opening.
iii)   The '[-shaped joiner releases the pelmet to adjustable lengths (maximum
       of X3), depending on the original packaged pelmet length. The joiner is
       retained in place and serves as a support and decorative function.
iv)    The joiner, coupling or sleeve can be used to house batteries, integrated
       circuits and computing and control mechanisms. Electricity storage
       capacity can be added into the end-plane sections [3] on the enxtension
       beams [2].
       The invention is designed in part, to solve the problem of cost and
       installation [4] for low-income households. It provides renters with feasible
       DIY (Do-It-Yourself), self-assembly options that are also compliant with
       normal tenancy agreements.
       The invention is designed to improve on existing pelmet technology
       by way of being adaptable as a solar energy collector and light source.

    IMPROVED WINDOW PELMET
   A pelmet, also known as a "cornice board" is a framework
   placed above a window for the primary purpose of concealing
   fixtures for window dressings and hardware used for hanging
   blinds and curtains, such as curtain rods and the supporting
5  brackets. A pelmet can be incorporated into the cornice
   architecture or sit below it at right angles to a structural void,
   usually a window.
   It is an object of the invention to design a pelmet that provides
10 an alternate means of functionality construction, manufacture,
   transport, supply, and installation [4]. The invention would
   be hung from picture hooks or alternative Velcro or adhesive
   strips.
15 A pelmet has the additional properties of insulating a room by
   preventing warm air escaping between the window furnishings
   and the glass. This is because heat rises, and then the cooling
   air falls into the window cavity, radiating warmth through the
   glass, and away from the building.

   Other objects and advantages of the present invention
   will become apparent from the following description, taken
   in connection with the accompanying drawings (page 6),
   wherein, by way of illustration and example, an embodiment of
25 the present invention is disclosed.
   A pelmet in accordance with this invention comprises a
   structural sleeve or housing packaging, from which the pelmet
   proper is then extended. The sleeve and the extensions
30 combined, then form the functional pelmet. This sleeve
   housing and extension method allows the user to make
   custom size-to-width adjustments, enabling one pelmet
   unit to fit more than one window size; potentially reducing

                                   Page 2
   procurement and installation costs. An object of the design
   is to provide a lightweight pelmet which can be moved, re
   sized and relocated with minimal technical skills of the user.
   The invention can be made from a variety of lightweight and
5  environmentally sustainable or recycled materials.
   Said materials can include, but are not restricted to Balsa
   wood, cardboard, ply-wood, MDF (Medium-density fibreboard),
   or corrugated plastic sheeting or corriboard, also known
10 commercially in Australia as Corflute@.
   Said materials can be fabric coated or left to be painted in
   a choice of colour by the user. What makes the invention
   innovative is the central joiner or 'sleeve' [labeled 1in the
15 accompanying drawing]. The pelmet extension arms and
   box unit exhibit the potential to include a lining of 'Flexible
   Amorphous' thin film enabling the Invention to be used as
   solar collection panel. The film is located on the window-facing
   edge and would react to sunlight significantly when the blinds
20 or curtains are open. An additional photo-voltaic collector
   solar cell could also be placed on the glass while connected
   by cable/wires to the invention for specific needs - thereby
   boosting its performance.
25 The solar film [3] if used, converts sunlight into electrical
   energy which can be stored within the invention in
   rechargeable batteries.
   Thin film amorphous silicon, is a type of silicon in which the
30 atoms do not form a regular crystalline lattice. With amorphous
   silicon, thinner layers of silicon can be used, again making
   the electric (photon) energy collection process much cheaper,
   though less efficient.
35 When needed, the stored energy can be discharged, via
   low-voltage electric circuit into light emitting diodes (LED), to
   provide ambient liaht or liahtina effects in the room where the

                                   Page 3
   invention is installed.
   The amount of ambient light without additional mains
   electricity supply would be sufficient to supply low intensity
   light via the LED configuration(s), to be suitable as a night
   light or for decorative effect. Said electronics would be
5  controlled manually or remotely depending on configuration
   determined by unit specifications.
   Less intensely engineered or non-powered or passive versions
   of the invention would include reflective insulation paper/foil
10 used in construction as a face-out lining - adding to cooling
   potential of the pelmet in summer
   Alternative top-boards can be installed [5], or substituted with
   various building materials as required.

The claims defining the invention are as follows:
1. A pelmet can comprise a rectangular or spherical or curved device
which is four-sided, or with a 30 percent to 50 percent opening,
and placed in or adjacent to a window cavity with the purpose of
concealing curtain rods, brackets and other hardware used for hanging
drapes or blinds. Pelmets without an enclosed top space [5] are
decorative only and not considered to be energy efficient.
2. The pelmet can as claimed in claim 1 be further designed [5] to
retain thermal control of heat or cooling of the structure to which it
is installed [4]. Thermal properties can include the use of insulation
paper, foil, fabric, or air-cell technology - in the form or bubble-wrap or
honeycombed or corrugated plastics.
Corrugations or plastic bubble-wrap linings can be engineered to act
like window double glazing by creating a thermal air-layer to insulate
and differentiate temperatures on one side of the pelmet from the other
3. The pelmet can as claimed in claim 1 be formed using building
materials. Insulators as described in claim 2 would form the
construction of the pelmet, by being applied as a coating to one side of
the pelmet or the other [3].
4. The pelmet sleeve or 'L-form' bracing device [Fig. 2] can be claimed
to be integral to the invention's innovation or novelty Also, in its
manufacture, storage, transportation, operations, functionality, fitting,
and finally in the structural support of the installed pelmet.
The '[ form [1] is a hollow right-angle into which slide the arms [2] or
extensions of the pelmet. As claimed in claim 1, the hollow section can
be a curved housing curved pelmet extensions. I.e. the same Invention
using different pelmet profiles.

                                   Page 5
5. The application of the pelmet Invention is claimed as an energy
collection [Fig. 3] or energy storage device, with the purpose of
providing electricity for use in low voltage LED (lighting) or cooling
effects, underpin its primary purpose (claim 2) of saving energy
Because the invention can harness the sun's radiation, the electricity
generated from the process, even if it is of low wattage, it can be used
to drive other devices within proximity or as part of the invention. E.g.
small fans in the headboard [5] or topside plane, to circulate air in a
room, or with a universal serial bus [USB] outlet to recharge a mobile
phone.
A pelmet primarily faces the outdoors and is exposed to daylight
which is solar radiation. By adding solar cells: be they photo-voltaic
collection cells, or Amorphous silicon films to the inside exposed edge
of the invention; normal solar radiation, or sunlight is then able to be
collected and converted into electricity
Method: Photon particles are trapped and chemically converted into
electricity using carbon atoms. This energy can be stored in the pelmet
device for later use, via the following battery types:
Nickel Cadmium (NiCd) battery
Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery
Lithium Ion battery
Lithium Polymer battery
