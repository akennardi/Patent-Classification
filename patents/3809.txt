                                 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES
   [0004]    Figure 1A shows an example system according to some embodiments;
   [0005]    Figure 1B shows an example configuration of the system of Figure 1A;
   [0006]    Figure 2 shows another example system according to some embodiments; and
15 [0007]    Figure 3 shows an example network element according to some embodiments.
                                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0008]    Referring to Figure 1A, there is shown an example system 100. System 100 may
   include a plurality of entities, including entity 110 and a plurality of entities 130a-n (one of
20 which is shown in detail in Figure 1A), one or more of which may be interconnected via
   network 103. Entity 110 may be, for example, a service provider that provides services, and
   each entity 130 may be, for example, a customer/user (e.g., such as a company, such as
   banks, investment funds, trading firm, etc.) of the services provided by service provider 110.
   For description purposes only, entity 110 will be referred to herein as a service provider and
25 entity(s) 130 will be referred to as a user(s)/customer(s). Nonetheless, these terms are
   intended to be non-limiting and other example entities are possible. In addition, entity 110
   being a service provider that provides services to entities 130 is also an example and other
   relationships between entities 110 and 130 are possible.
30 [0009]    As one example, service provider 110 may provide one or more electronic
   marketplaces for the trading/buying-selling/matching of items (such as, for example, financial
   instruments, real-estate, bets/wagers, tangible goods, services, etc. ) and as such, may provide
                                                       1

   one or more electronic matching/trading engines. Similarly, customers 130 may seek to trade
   one or more items on the electronic market place(s) provided by service provider 130.
   According to this example, one or more of customer 130 may electronically communicate
   data/messages, for example, to service provider 110 including, for example, orders to buy
 5 and/or sell items at specified prices and/or quantities (e.g., bids, offers, hits, takes). Similarly,
   service provider 110 may electronically receive and execute such orders and communicate
   data/messages to customers 130 including, for example, prices and quantities of pending and
   executed orders. One skilled in the art will recognize that this is merely an example and that
   other and/or additional services may be provided by service provider 110 and that additional
10 and/or other messages/data may be transferred between services provider 110 and customers
    130. For example, one or more of customer 130 may electronically communicate
   data/messages, for example, to service provider 110 including, for example, orders to back or
   lay a team or event, etc. at specified odds and/or stakes. Similarly, service provider 110 may
   electronically receive and execute/match such orders and communicate data/messages to
15 customers 130 including, for example, specified odds and/or stakes of pending and executed
   orders.
   [0010]    Service provider 110 may include one or more network elements 112, and one or
   more computing systems 114 (which may include/or be connected to one or more database
20 systems) that provide services, for example, to customers 130. One skilled in the art will
   recognize that service provider 110 may include additional and/other computing systems,
   and/or network elements. Computing systems 114 may be referred to herein as servers for
   purposes of description. However, it should be understood that the use of the term server is
   non-limiting, and that other types of computing systems may be used. One or more of servers
25  114 may include one or more processors and one or more memories. One or more of servers
    114 also may include one or more network hardware/software/firmware based
   interfaces/ports that enable the servers to connect to network elements 112 and thereby
   network 103. Such interfaces may be configured to support one or more different types of
   physical network connections, such as copper, fiber optic, and/or wireless, may be configured
30 to support one or more different types of protocols, such as Ethernet, and may be configured
   to operate at any speed, such as Gb rates. One skilled in the art will recognize that servers
    114 may have additional and/or other configurations. Service provider 110 may also include
   one or more software and/or firmware and/or hardware based applications that may be stored
                                                     2

   on one or more database systems and/or servers 114, and be configured to execute on one or
   more of servers 114. Each server may execute the same or different applications. As one
   example, the application(s) may be configured to provide one or more electronic
   matching/trading engines for the trading/matching of one or more items as described herein.
 5
   [0011]    Network element(s) 112 may include, for example, one or more routers and/or
   switches including, for example, core and/or edge routers and/or switches. Each of network
   elements 112 may include one or more network hardware/software/firmware based
   interfaces/ports that enable the network elements to connect to one another, one or more of
10 servers 114, and/or network 103. Such interfaces may be configured to support one or more
   different types of physical network connections, such as copper, fiber optic, and/or wireless,
   may be configured to support one or more different types of protocols, such as Ethernet, and
   may be configured to operate at any speed, such as Gb rates. One skilled in the art will
   recognize that network elements 112 may have additional and/or other configurations. One
15 or more of network elements 112 may contain one or more physical connections
   (wired/wireless) to each other, servers 114, and/or network 103. Network elements 112 and
   one or more of servers 114 may be further configured such that one or more of servers 114
   have private network addresses and thereby reside on a private network of service provider
    110, and/or have public addresses and thereby reside on a public network. In this fashion,
20 network elements 112 may be configured such that servers 114 may communicate with one
   another and/or with network 103 and thereby with one or more other computing systems, for
   example, connected to network 103, such as computing system(s) 138 of customers 130. One
   skilled in the art will also recognize that network elements 112 may include additional and/or
   other elements as described herein, and may provide additional and/or other type of
25 functionality than described herein.
   [0012]    An example customer 130 (as shown by customer 130a) may include one or more
   network elements 132, 134, and 136, and one or more computing systems 138 (which may
   include/or be connected to one or more database systems). One skilled in the art will
30 recognize that a customer 130 may include additional and/other computing systems, and/or
   network elements. One skilled in the art will recognize that other customers 130 may include
   similar and/or other configurations as that of customer 130a shown in Figure 1A. Computing
   systems 138 may be referred to herein as servers for purposes of description. However, it
                                                      3

   should be understood that the use of the term server is non-limiting, and that other types of
   computing systems may be used. One or more of servers 138 may include one or more
   processors and one or more memories. One or more of servers 138 also may include one or
   more network hardware/software/firmware based interfaces/ports that enable the servers to
 5 connect to one or more of network elements 132-136 and thereby network 103. Such
   interfaces may be configured to support one or more different types of physical network
   connections, such as copper, fiber optic, and/or wireless, may be configured to support one or
   more different types of protocols, such as Ethernet, and may be configured to operate at any
   speed, such as Gb rates. One skilled in the art will recognize that servers 138 may have
10 additional and/or other configurations. Customer 130 may also include one or more software
   and/or firmware and/or hardware based applications that may be stored on one or more
   database systems and/or servers 138, and be configured to execute on one or more of servers
    138. Each server may execute the same or different applications. As one example, the
   application(s) may be configured to use the services provided by server(s) 114 of service
15 provider 110 and in particular, may be configured to trade one or more items with one or
   more other customers 130, for example, through the use of electronic matching/trading
   engine(s) provided by server(s) 114 of service provider 110. According to this example, one
   or more of servers of 138 of customer 130 may electronically communicate via network 103
   data/messages, for example, to servers 114 of service provider 110 including, for example,
20 orders to buy and/or sell items at specified prices and/or quantities (e.g., bids, offers, hits,
   takes). Similarly, servers 114 of service provider 110 may electronically receive and execute
   such orders and communicate data/messages to servers 138 of customer 130 including, for
   example, prices and quantities of pending and executed orders. One skilled in the art will
   recognize that this is merely an example and that other and/or additional services may be
25 provided by service provider 110 and that additional and/or other messages/data may be
   transferred between service provider 110 and customers 130, as described herein
   [0013]    Network element(s) 132-136 of customer 130 may include, for example, one or
   more routers and/or switches including, for example, core and/or edge routers and/or
30 switches. Each of network elements may include one or more network
   hardware/software/firmware based interfaces/ports that enable the network elements to
   connect to one another, to one or more of servers 138, and/or network 103. Such interfaces
   may be configured to support one or more different types of physical network connections,
                                                     4

   such as copper, fiber optic, and/or wireless, may be configured to support one or more
   different types of protocols, such as Ethernet, and may be configured to operate at any speed,
   such as Gb rates. One skilled in the art will recognize that network elements 132-136 may
   have additional and/or other configurations. One or more of network elements 132-136 may
 5 contain one or more physical connections (wired/wireless) to each other, to one or more of
   servers 138, and/or network 103. Network elements 132-136 may be further configured such
   that one or more of servers 138 have private network addresses and thereby reside on a
   private network of a respective customer 130, and/or have public addresses and thereby
   reside on a public network. In this fashion, network elements 132-136 may be configured
10 such that servers 114 may communicate with one another and/or with network 103 and
   thereby with one or more other computing systems, for example, connected to network 103,
   such as servers 114. One skilled in the art will also recognize that network elements 132-136
   may include additional and/or other elements as described herein, and may provide additional
   and/or other type of functionality than that described herein.
15
   [0014]    Network 103 may include one or more network elements including, for example,
   one or more routers and/or switches. Such network elements may include one or more
   network hardware/software/firmware based interfaces/ports that may be configured to
   support one or more different types of physical network connections, such as copper, fiber
20 optic, and/or wireless, may be configured to support one or more different types of protocols,
   such as Ethernet, and may be configured to operate at any speed, such as Gb rates. One or
   more elements of network 103 may contain one or more physical connections
   (wired/wireless) to each other and to each of entity 110 and entities 130. In this fashion,
   network 103 may be configured such that computing systems 114 of entity 110 and
25 computing systems 138 of entity(s) 130 may communicate with at least one another.
   Network 103 may be configured as a public and/or private network(s). One skilled in the art
   will also recognize that network 103 may include additional and/or other network elements as
   described herein, and may be configured in additional and/or fashions than described herein.
30 [0015]    Turning to Figure 1B where similar reference numbers refer to similar elements as
   described herein, there is shown a system 200 which may be an example configuration of
   system 100 of Figure 1A. According to this example, network elements 112 of service
   provider 110 may include a switch, such as core switch, that includes one or more
                                                     5

   connections to each of servers 114. As an example, network element 112 may be an Arista
   7124 application switch although other and/or additional network elements may be used.
   Network element 112 and one or more of servers 114 may be further configured such that one
   or more of servers 114 have network addresses on network 103, which address(es) may be
 5 referred to as "public" address(es) (although the address(es) may not actually be public).
   According to an example aspect of example system 200, network 103 may be a private
   network (possibly owned or leased) of service provider 110. According to this example,
   network element 112 and one or more of servers 114 would be part of network 103. In other
   words, the network interfaces of network element 112 that interface servers 114 and that also
10 interface customers 130 may be on the same address space.
   [0016]    According to a further aspect of this example configuration of Figure 1B, network
   element 136 of an example customer 130 (as shown by customer 130a) may include a switch,
   such as core switch, network element 134 may be a switch, such as an edge switch, and
15 network element 132 may be a router. Switch 136 may include one or more connections to
   each of servers 138 and one or more connections to switch 134. In turn, switch 134 may
   include one or more connections to router 136. Network elements 132-136 and one or more
   of servers 136 may be further configured such that one or more of servers 138 have private
   network addresses (i.e., addresses not on network 103) and thereby reside on a private
20 network separate from network 103. Other customers 130n may have similar configurations.
   [0017]    According to a further aspect of this example configuration of Figure 1B, each
   customer 130 may have one (possibly more) addresses on network 103, which address(es)
   may be referred to as "public" address(es) (although the address(es) may not actually be
25 public). Accordingly, each router 132 may also be configured as a network address and
   possibly port address translator (NAT/PAT) that maps between one or more private addresses
   of servers 138 on the customer 130 network and the public address assigned to the respective
   customer 130 on network 103, for example. Accordingly, when a server 138 is
   communicating a message/data (which may be encapsulated in a packet that includes
30 addresses and/or ports for example) to a server 114, router 136 may translate a private
   address of server 138 in the packet to the public address assigned to customer 130 on network
    103. Again, such translation may also include translating a port number being used by an
   application on server 138 to another port number. Similarly, when a server 110 is
                                                     6

   communicating a message/data (which may be encapsulated in a packet that includes
   addresses and/or ports for example) to a server 138, router 136 may translate the public
   address assigned to customer 130 in the packet to the private address of server 138. Again,
   router 136 may also perform port translation as part of the address translation.
 5
   [0018]     According to a further aspect of this example configuration of Figure 1B, network
    103 may include point to point connections 113a-n (although again, non-point to point
   connections are possible) between switch 112 of service provider 110 and each of routers
    132, for example, of customers 130. For example, each connection between switch 112 of
10 service provider 110 and a router 132, for example, of a customer 130 may be a fiber
   connection such as a single mode fiber connection, running at 1Gb for example (although
   other types of connections and rates may be used). According to a still further aspect of this
   example configuration, one or more of: servers 114 and network element 112 of service
   provider 110, and network elements 132-136 and servers 138 of respective customers 130
15 may be co-located, such as in the same room. For example, one or more of servers 114 and
   network element 112 may reside in one rack. Similarly, one or more of network elements
    132-136 and servers 138 of a first respective customer 130 may reside in another respective
   rack, etc. One skilled in the art will also recognize that system 200 may include additional
   and/or other elements than those described herein, and may include additional and/or other
20 configurations than those described herein.
   [0019]     One example problem with example system 100 and 200 as shown in Figures 1A
   and lB is that significant delays may be introduced when data is communicated between
   servers 114 and servers 138. As a specific example, router 132 of may introduce delays (e.g.,
25 greater than a 100us) as result of, for example, the network/port translation functionalities.
   Similarly, different routers 132 at different customers 130 may experience different delays.
   [0020]     Turning to Figure 2 where similar reference numbers refer to similar elements as
   described herein, there is shown an example system 300 that is similar to the example system
30 200 of Figure 1B.    According to this example, system 200 includes network element 202.
   Network element 202 may be part of service provider 110 and as such, may be owned and/or
   operated by service provider 110. Network element may be co-located with servers 114 of
   service provider 110 and/or one or more network elements, including network element 112,
                                                      7

   of service provider 110, and may reside in the same rack as these elements. One skilled in
   the art will recognize that network element 202 need not be owned and/or operated by service
   provider 110 and need not be co-located with the network elements and/or servers of service
   provider 110.
 5
   [0021]      Network element 202 may include one or more network
   hardware/software/firmware based interfaces/ports 204a ... 204n that enable the network
   element to connect to servers 114, possibly via network element 112, for example. Network
   element 202 may also include one or more network hardware/software/firmware based
10 interfaces/ports 206a ... 206n that enable the network element to connect to server(s) 138, for
   example, of respective customers 130a-n. The network interfaces 204a-n and 206a-n of
   network element 202 may be configured to support one or more different types of physical
   network connections, such as copper, fiber optic, and/or wireless, may be configured to
   support one or more different types of protocols, such as Ethernet, and may be configured to
15 operate at any speed, such as Gb rates. Furthermore, different network interfaces 204a-n and
   206a-n may have different configurations. One skilled in the art will recognize that network
   element 202 may have additional and/or other configurations.
   [0022]    As further shown in Figure 2, one or more of network interface(s) 204a-n of
20 network element 202 may be physically connected (wired/wirelessly), for example, by
   connection(s) 210a-n to network element 112, which may be a switch. According to another
   and/or additional example, one or more of network interface(s) 204a-n of network element
   202 may each be physically connected by one or more connection(s) 210a-n directly to a
   respective server 114 of service provider 110. According to a further aspect of example
25 system 300, each customer 130a-n may be allocated one or more respective network
   interfaces 206a-n of network element 202. Accordingly, each respective network interface
   206a-n of network element 202 may be physically connected (wired/wirelessly), for example,
   by a connection 212a-n to a respective server 138 of a respective customer 130a-n either
   directly and/or via one or more network elements (such as network elements 136, which may
30 be a switch for example) of a respective customer. For example, each connection 212a-n
   may be a fiber connection such as a single mode fiber connection, running at 1Gb for
   example (although other types of connections and rates may be used). One skilled in the art
                                                     8

   will recognize that additional and/or other configurations of network element 202 and system
   300 are possible.
   [0023]    According to a further aspect of example system 300, network interface(s) 204a-n of
 5 network element 202, connections 210a-n, network element 112, and one or more of servers
    114 may reside on a network 214, which may be a private network of service provider 110
   and have a network address space. Accordingly, network element 112 and one or more of
   servers 114 may be configured such that one or more of servers 114 have network addresses
   on network 214 within the network address space. According to a further aspect of this
10 example configuration, network interface 206a, connection 212a, network element 136 of
   respective customers 130a, for example, and one or more of servers 138 of respective
   customers 130a may reside on a network 216a of customer 130a, which may be a private
   network of customer 130a and have a network address space. Accordingly, network element
    136 and one or more of servers 138 of customer 130a may be configured such that the one or
15 more of servers 138 have network addresses on network 216a within the respective network
   address space. Similarly, network interface 206n, connection 212n, network element 136 of
   customer 130n, for example, and one or more of servers 138 of customer 130n may reside on
   a network 216n of customer 130n, which may be a private network of customer 130n and
   have a respective network address space. Accordingly, network element 136 and one or more
20 of servers 138 of customer 130n may be configured such that one or more of servers 138 of
   customer 130n have network addresses on network 216n within the respective network
   address space. Other customers 130 note shown in Figure 2 may have similar configurations.
   [0024]    According to a further aspect of this example system, network element 202 may be,
25 for example, a bi-directional network address and possibly port address translator
   (NAT/PAT). More specifically, according to this example, each customer 130a-n may have
   one (possibly more) addresses on network 214 within the network address space of network
   214. Accordingly, for each customer 130a-n, network element 202 may be configured as a
   NAT/PAT that maps between one or more addresses of servers 138 on the respective
30 customer network 216a-n (i.e., within the network address space of the respective network)
   and the address assigned to the respective customer 130a-n on network 214, for example,
   within the network address space of network 214. Accordingly, when a server 138 is
   communicating a message/data (which may be encapsulated in a packet that includes
                                                     9

   addresses and/or ports for example) to a server 114, network element 202 may translate an
   address on network 216a-n of server 138 in the packet to the address assigned to customer
    130a-n on network 214. Again, such translation may also include translating a port number
   in the packet being used by an application on a server 138 to another port number. Similarly,
 5 when a server 110 is communicating a message/data (which may be encapsulated in a packet
   that includes addresses and/or ports for example) to a server 138, network element 202 may
   translate the address assigned to customer 130a-n on network 214 in the packet to the address
   of server 138 on network 216a-n. Again, network element 202 may also perform port
   translation as part of the address translation.
10
   [0025]    Turning to Figure 3 where similar reference numbers refer to similar elements as
   described herein, there is shown an example architecture of network element 202. Network
   element 202 may include a plurality of computing processors, including one or more of
   processors 301a ... 301n, and one or more of processors 302a, 302b, .... 302n. Processors
15 301a-n may be referred to herein as scheduling processors, and processors 302a-n may be
   referred to herein as network processors. The terms "scheduling" and "network" are intended
   to be non-limiting and are used herein for ease of discussion only. Each of processors 30la-n
   and302a-n may or may not be similarly configured in terms of, for example, memory,
   processing speed, etc. One skilled in the art will recognize that network element 202 may
20 include additional and or fewer processors. According to a further aspect of example
   network element 202, any one or more of scheduling processors 30la-n and network
   processors 302a-n may be interconnected to one another through a communications
   architecture, such as a bus architecture, which may include for example, a shard memory
   architecture. One skilled in the art will recognize that other and/or additional communication
25 architectures are possible. The communication architecture may be such that any of the
   scheduling processor 301a-n may be configured to communicate with any one of the network
   processors 302a-n. One skilled in the art will recognize that other configurations are
   possible.
30 [0026]    Network element 202 may also include, as discussed herein, one or more network
   interfaces 214a-n that may be configured, for example, to interface directly or indirectly with
   servers 114, and one or more network interfaces 206a-n that may be configured, for example,
   to interface with respective customers 130a-n. Network interfaces 204a-n and 206a-n may
                                                      10

   have the same configuration and/or one or more different configurations. For example,
   interfaces 204a-n and 206a-n may be any combination of long range or short range, single
   mode or multi mode fiber interfaces running at 1Gb or 10Gb rates, for example. One or more
   of network interfaces 204a-n and 206a-n may by physically situated on its own network
 5 interface card and/or several of network interfaces 204a-n and 206a-n may by physically
   situated on a common network interface card or cards. One skilled in the art will recognize
   that other configurations are possible.
   [0027]    As discussed herein, each network interface 206a-n may be allocated to and
10 interface with a respective customer 130a-n. One skilled in the art will recognize that a given
   customer may be allocated multiple network interfaces (for example, for load balancing
   purposes, backup, etc.). According to a further aspect of example network element 202, each
   network interface 206a-n may be assigned/allocated to a respective one of the network
   processors 302a-n such that all data communicated over the respective network interface is
15 only handled by the respective network processor. One skilled in the art will recognize,
   however, that additional and/or other configurations are possible including assigning two or
   more network interfaces 206a-n to a given network processor 302a-n and/or assigning a two
   or more network processors 302a-n to a given network interface 206a-n. According to a
   further aspect of example network element 202, a given network interface 206a-n may be
20 interconnected to its respective network processor 302a-n through a communications
   architecture, such as a bus architecture, such as a PCIe bus architecture. One skilled in the art
   will recognize that other and/or additional communication architectures are possible. The
   communication architecture may be such that any network interface 206a-n may be
   configured to communicate with any one or more of the network processors 302a-n and vice
25 versa. According to a further aspect of network element 202, each network processor 302a-n
   may be shielded from all interrupts other than, for example, interrupts from its associated
   network interface 206a-n. One skilled in the art will recognize that other configurations are
   possible.
30 [0028]    As further shown in Figure 3, example network element 202 may include one or
   more network applications 303a-n. Applications 303a-n may be software based applications,
   although other and/or additional configurations are possible including firmware and/or
   hardware based applications. Network element 202 may also include one or more memory
                                                     11

   devices on which applications 303a-n may be stored and/or from which the applications may
   execute. Such memory devices may be electronically connected to one or more of processors
   30la-n and 302a-n. According to an aspect of network element 202, each network processor
   may execute an application 303a-n. According to a further aspect of network element 202,
 5 each application 303a-n may only execute on a respective processor. Hence, application
   303a may only execute on processor 302a, application 303b may only execute on processor
   302b, etc. This may be referred to as processor affinity. One skilled in the art will recognize,
   however, that additional and/or other configurations are possible including having multiple
   applications 303a-n execute on a single processor 302a-n and/or having one or more of
10 applications 303a-n execute on multiple processors.
   [0029]    As such, according to an example configuration of network element 202, a given
   network application 303a-n may be assigned/allocated to and execute on a respective network
   processor 302a-n, which may be assigned/allocated to a respective network interface 206a-n,
15 which may be assigned/allocated to a respective customer 130a-n. According to a further
   aspect of this example configuration, each network application 302a-n may be configured as
   a NAT and possibly a PAT and perform network/port translation for messages/data passing
   between network 214 and a respective network 216a-n of a respective customer 130a-n.
   Accordingly, network element 202 may be configured (such as by a network administrator) to
20 assign/allocate a given network interface 206a-n to a given network processor 302a-n and be
   further configured such that the network application 303a-n on each network processor
   performs NAT/PAT functions based on the customer 130a-n to which the assigned interface
   is connected. According to the physical hardware configuration/layout of network processors
   302a-n and network interfaces 206a-n and/or the amount of data being generated by each
25 respective customer 130a-n and/or sent to each respective customer, certain
   assignments/allocations of network interfaces 206a-n to network processors 302a-n may be
   more beneficial than others in terms of total data throughput of network element 202 and be
   assigned accordingly, such as by an administrator. For example, it may beneficial to allocate
   a given network interface 206a-n to a near network processor 302a-n. One skilled in the art
30 will recognize that network applications 302a-n need not be configured as NAT/PAT and that
   one network application may be configured to perform different functions than another
   network application, etc.
                                                    12

   [0030]    According to a further aspect of example network element 202, each network
   interface 204a-n may be assigned/allocated to a respective one of the scheduling processors
   30la-n such that all data communicated over the respective network interface is only handled
   by the respective scheduling processor. One skilled in the art will recognize, however, that
 5 additional and/or other configurations are possible. For example, all network interfaces 204a
   n may be assigned/allocated to one of the scheduling processors 30la-n and/or each of the
   scheduling processors may be configured to communicate with any one or more of network
   interfaces 204a-n. According to a further aspect of example network element 202, a given
   network interface 204a-n may be interconnected to a respective scheduling processor(s)
10 301a-n through a communications architecture, such as a bus architecture, such as a PCle bus
   architecture. One skilled in the art will recognize that other and/or additional communication
   architectures are possible. The communication architecture may be such that any network
   interface 204a-n may be configured to communicate with any one or more of the scheduling
   processors 30la-n and vice versa. According to a further aspect of network element 202, one
15 or more of scheduling processors 301a-n may be shielded from all interrupts other than, for
   example, interrupts from one or more of network interfaces 204a-n. One skilled in the art
   will recognize that other configurations are possible.
   [0031]    As further shown in Figure 3, network element 202 may also include one or more
20 scheduling applications and/or one or more administration applications, which are shown
   collectively in Figure 3 as applications 304a-n. Applications 304a-n may be software based
   applications, although other configurations are possible including firmware and/or hardware
   based applications. As discussed, network element 202 may also include one or more
   memory devices on which applications 304a-n may be stored and/or from which the
25 applications may execute. According to one example of network element 202, each
   scheduling processor 301a-n may execute one or more scheduling applications, one or more
   administration applications, or a combination of both. As another example, a scheduling
   application and/or an administration application may execute on multiple processors. As
   another example, a scheduling application may execute on one scheduling processor 301 a-n
30 and be responsible for (as further discussed herein) a subset of network processors 302a-n,
   while another scheduling application may execute on another scheduling processor 30la-n
   and be responsible for a different subset of network processors 302a-n. As another example,
   a scheduling application may execute on one scheduling processor 30la-n and be responsible
                                                     13

   for all network processors 302a-n. As a further example, a scheduling application may
   execute on multiple scheduling processors 301 a-n and be responsible for all network
   processors 302a-n. One skilled in the art will recognize that other variations are possible.
   For ease of description, network element 202 will be described herein as having one
 5 scheduling application and one administration application. One skilled in the art will
   recognize that network element 202 may include other types of applications than those
   described herein.
   [0032]     According to a further aspect of example network element 202, the scheduling
10 application 304 may be configured to pass messages/data between network interfaces 206a-n
   and network interfaces 204a-n as follows:
                a. For messages/data received on a network interfaces 206a-n, once the
                   respective network application 303a-n has performed NAT/PAT translation on
                   a respective packet, for example, scheduling application 304 may
15                 retrieve/obtain the translated packet and forward/communicate the translated
                   packet onto/to one of network interfaces 204a-n.
                b. For messages/data received on a network interfaces 204a-n, scheduling
                   application 304 may obtain the messages/data, determine which of the
                   respective network applications 303a-n is performing NAT/PAT translation
20                 for the respective packets, and forward/communicate the packets to that
                   network application, where the packet may be translated (NAT/PAT ) and
                   forwarded/ communicated onto/to the respective network interface 206a-n.
   [0033]     As such, according to an example operation of network element 202, a given server
25  138 of a given customer 130a-n may transmit a message/data (which may be encapsulated in
   a packet for example that includes addresses and/or ports) to a server 114 of service provider
    110. That message/data/packet may be received at a given network interface 206a-n of
   network element 202. A given network application 303a-n of the network processor 302a-n
   that is assigned to that network interface 206a-n may then obtain/receive and/or be forwarded
30 the message/data/packet (or portion thereof) from the network interface 206 and perform
   NAT/PAT translation on the respective packet. The network application 303a-n may then
   forward and/or make available the translated message/data/packet to the scheduling
   application 304 which in turn may then obtain and/or receive the translated
                                                     14

   message/data/packet, and then forward and/or make available the translated
   message/data/packet to a respective network interface 204a-n, where the message/data/packet
   may then be communicated to the server 114. Similarly, a given server 114 of service
   provider 110 may transmit a message/data (which may be encapsulated in a packet for
 5 example) to a server 138 of the customer 130a-n. That message/data/packet may be received
   at a given network interface 204a-n of network element 202. The scheduling application 304
   may then obtain/receive and/or be forwarded the message/data/packet (or a portion thereof)
   from the network interface 204a-n, determine which of the respective network applications
   303a-n/network processors 302a-n is performing NAT/PAT translation for that
10 message/data/packet, and forward and/or make available the message/data/packet to that
   network application 303a-n (as one example, and other implementations are possible, in
   order for the scheduling application to forward messages/data to the correct network
   processor 302a-n, the scheduling application may maintain a table - which may be
   configured by an administrator - that maps network addresses associated with customers 130
15 to respective network processors 302a-n). The network application 303a-n in turn may obtain
   and/or receive the message/data/packet, perform NAT/PAT translation on the respective
   packet and forward and/or make available the translated message/data/packet to a respective
   network interface 206a-n that is assigned to the network processor 302a-n on which the
   network application 303a-n is executing. That network interface 206 may then communicate
20 the message/data/packet to server 138 of the customer 130a-n. One skilled in the art will
   recognize that this is only an example, and other and/or additional example operations of
   network element 202 are possible. One skilled in the art will also recognize that operations
   performed by scheduling application 304 as described herein and operations performed
   network applications 303a-n as described herein may be performed in whole or in part by the
25 other.
   [0034]    Regarding the communications between scheduling application 304 and any given
   network application 303a-n, as one example the two applications may communicate via one
   or more (e.g., two) shared memory circular queues. For example, a network application 303
30 may place a translated message from a network interface 206 into a first memory queue, and
   update indexes/pointers, for example, to the queue to reflect that another message is in the
   queue. Similarly, scheduling application 304 may monitor the indexes/pointers to the queue,
   recognize there is a new message in the queue, read the message out, and update the
                                                    15

   indexes/pointers, for example, to reflect that the message has been read out. Similarly, the
   scheduling application 304 may place a message from a network interface 204 into a second
   memory queue, and update indexes/pointers, for example, to that queue to reflect that another
   message is in the second queue. Similarly, network application 303 may monitor the
 5 indexes/pointers to the second queue, recognize there is a new message in the queue, read the
   message out, and update the indexes/pointers, for example, to reflect that the message has
   been read out. A similar process may be used for other network applications 303 (which may
   have their own set of queues) to communicate with scheduling application 304. One skilled
   in the art will recognize that this is merely an example and other communication
10 techniques/processes may be used.
   [0035]     As discussed, network element 202 may also include an administration application
   304 that may execute on a scheduling processor 301a-n, for example. Such an application
   may be used by an administrator to monitor the status of network element 202 and configure
15 the network element. For example, network element 202 may include, for example, one or
   more input/output devices such as a display interface, mouse, keyboard, touch screen,
   network interface (for remote access) etc. Through the use of such interfaces and
   administration application 304, for example, an administrator may monitor the status of
   network element 202 and configure the network element. For example, an administrator may
20 assign/allocate and/or re-assign/re-allocate a given network interface 206a-n to a given
   network processor 302a-n. The administrator may further configure the network application
   303a-n of a given network processor 302 (e.g., as to the addresses and/or ports the network
   application 303 is translating between) according to the customer 130a-n that network
   application 303 is performing NAT/PAT translations on behalf of. One skilled in the art will
25 recognize that a network application may be configured in other fashions. One advantage, for
   example, of the hardware/software configuration of network element 202 is that an
   administrator, for example, may reconfigure a given customer 130a-n (in terms of, e.g., the
   NAT/PAT configuration, in terms of which network processor 302a-n is assigned to the
   customer, and/or in terms of which network interface 206a-n is assigned to the network
30 processor 302a-n and/or customer) without disrupting other customers. Administration
   application 304 may also include, for example, an IPMI subsystem so that an administrator
   can monitor the status of network element 202. Such a subsystem may also be separate from
                                                      16

   administration application 304. One skilled in the art will recognize that these are only
   example administrative functions, and other/additional functions are possible.
   [0036]    According to a further aspect of network element 202, the network element may
 5 also include one or more memory devices, such as solid state drives, and may include one or
   more logging applications that capture all (or part) of the data moving through the network
   element and log the data to the drives. According to a further aspect, the logging application
   may filter the data and store only portions of the data and/or may run analysis on the data
   (such as latency calculations) and store such analysis. According to a still further aspect, the
10 logging application may filter the data (such as looking for market data prices, completed
   transactions, etc.) and/or perform analysis on the data and forward the filtered data and/or
   analysis onto another network interface(s) (e.g. different from network interfaces 204a-n and
   206a-n). Other systems and users (like customers 130), external to network element 202,
   may receive such data and/or analysis, including receiving the data and/or analysis for a
15 price. One skilled in the art will recognize that these are only example logging functions, and
   other/additional logging functions are possible.
   [0037]    According to an example implementation of network element 202, an Intel Sandy
   Bridge processor that includes a plurality of cores (e.g., 8) may be used to provide one or
20 more of processors 301a-n and 302a-n. For example, for a given Sandy Bridge processor,
   one or more cores may be allocated as scheduling processors 302a-n and one or more cores
   may be allocated as network processors 303a-n. Such cores may be configured and operate
   as described herein for processors 301a-n and 302a-n. Network element 202 may also
   include a multiple Sandy Bridge Processors. Here, for each Sandy Bridge processor, one or
25 more cores may be allocated as network processors 302a-n and one or more cores may be
   allocated as scheduling processors 30 1a-n (that may, for example, only work with the
   network processors of that chip for purposes of moving messages between network interfaces
   204a-n and 206a-n). In such a configuration, any of network interfaces 206a-n may be
   allocated to any of the network processors (cores) of the Sandy Bridges. Alternatively, only
30 certain network interfaces 206a-n may be allocated to one Sandy Bridge processor while
   another set of network interfaces 206a-n may be allocated to another Sandy Bridge processor,
   etc. Similarly, any of network interfaces 204a-n may be allocated to any of the scheduling
   processors (cores) of the Sandy Bridge processors. Alternatively, only certain network
                                                     17

   interfaces 204a-n may be allocated to one Sandy Bridge processor while another set of
   network interfaces 206a-n may be allocated to another Sandy Bridge processor, etc. One
   skilled in the art will recognize that these are merely examples, and that other configurations
   and other chip sets may be used.
 5
   [0038]    According to a further example implementation of network element 202, network
   interfaces 204a-n and/or 206a-n may be provided through one or more network interface
   cards from Hotlava, for example, including any one or more of the Tambora 120G6, Tambora
   64G6, Tambora 80G4, Tambora 64G4, and Bosavi 12G6. One skilled in the art will
10 recognize that these are merely examples, and that other network interface cards, including
   those from other suppliers, may be used.
   [0039]    According to a further example implementation of network element 202, the Sandy
   Bridge processor(s), for example, and network interface cards from Hotlava, for example,
15 may be inserted onto a single motherboard and such system may run a the Linux operating
   system. Again, one skilled in the art will recognize that these are merely examples, and that
   other configurations are possible.
   [0040]    One skilled in the art will recognize that network element 202 may also be
20 configured (e.g., while also being configured as discussed herein in Figure 2 and 3) in a
   reverse direction. For example, a given server 114 on network 214 may have one (possibly
   more) addresses on another network, such as network 216a, although some other network
   interfaced to a network interface 206 is possible. Accordingly, for given server 114, network
   element 202 may be configured as a NAT/PAT (as discussed herein) that maps between one
25 or more addresses of server 114 on customer network 214 and the address assigned to the
   server on network 216a, for example.
   [0041]    While this disclosure has been described in terms of certain embodiments and
   generally associated methods, alterations and permutations of the embodiments and methods
30 will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the above description of example
   embodiments does not constrain this disclosure. Other changes, substitutions, and alterations
   are also possible without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure.
                                                      18

   [0042]     The following sections provide a guide to interpreting the present application.
          I.        Terms
   [0043] The term "product" means a machine, manufacture and/or composition of matter,
 5 unless expressly specified otherwise.
   [0044]     The term "process" means a process, algorithm, method or the like, unless expressly
   specified otherwise.
10 [0045]     Each process (whether called a method, algorithm or otherwise) inherently includes
   one or more steps, and therefore all references to a "step" or "steps" of a process have an
   inherent antecedent basis in the mere description of a process, or in the mere recitation of the
   term 'process' or a like term. Accordingly, any reference in a claim to a 'step' or 'steps' of a
   process has sufficient antecedent basis.
15
   [0046]     The term "invention" and the like mean "the one or more inventions disclosed in
   this application", unless expressly specified otherwise.
   [0047]     The terms "an embodiment", "embodiment", "embodiments", "the embodiment",
20 "the embodiments", "one or more embodiments", "some embodiments", "certain
   embodiments", "one embodiment", "another embodiment" and the like mean "one or more
   (but not all) embodiments of the invention", unless expressly specified otherwise.
   [0048]     The term "variation" of an invention means an embodiment of the invention, unless
25 expressly specified otherwise.
   [0049]     The term "indication" is used in an extremely broad sense. An "indication" of a
   thing should be understood to include anything that may be used to determine the thing.
30 [0050]     An indication of a thing may include an electronic message that identifies the thing
   (e.g., an identification of a widget by a serial number affixed to the widget, an identification
   of a widget by one or more characteristics of the widget). An indication of a thing may
   include information that may be used to compute and/or look-up a thing (e.g., information
   identifying a machine of which a widget is a part that may be used to determine the widget).
35 An indication of a thing may specify things that are related to the thing (e.g., characteristics
   of the thing, a name of the thing, a name of a thing related to the thing). An indication of a
                                                      19

   thing may not specify things that are related to the thing (e.g., a letter "a" may be an
   indication of a widget of a computer system that is configured to interpret the letter "a" to
   identify the widget). An indication of a thing may include a sign, a symptom, and/or a token
   of the thing. An indication, for example, may include a code, a reference, an example, a link,
 5 a signal, and/or an identifier. An indication of a thing may include information that
   represents, describes, and/or otherwise is associated with the thing.
   [0051]     A transformation of an indication of a thing may be an indication of the thing (e.g.,
   an encrypted indication of a thing may be an indication of the thing). An indication of a thing
10 may include the thing itself, a copy of the thing, and/or a portion of the thing. An indication
   of a thing may be meaningless to a thing that is not configured to understand the indication
   (e.g., a person may not understand that a letter "a" indicates a widget but it may nonetheless
   be an indication of the widget because the computer system may determine the widget from
   the letter "a"). It should be understood that the fact that an indication of a thing may be used
15 to determine the thing does not mean that the thing or anything else is determined. An
   indication of a thing may include an indication of any number of the thing unless specified
   otherwise. An indication of a thing may include an indication of other things (e.g., an
   electronic message that indicates many things). (Indication can be used as a very broad term
   in claim language. For example: receiving an indication of a financial instrument.)
20
   [0052]     The term "represent" means (1) to serve to express, designate, stand for, or denote,
   as a word, symbol, or the like does; (2) to express or designate by some term, character,
   symbol, or the like; (3) to portray or depict or present the likeness of, as a picture does; or (4)
   to serve as a sign or symbol of.
25
   [0053]     A reference to "another embodiment" in describing an embodiment does not imply
   that the referenced embodiment is mutually exclusive with another embodiment (e.g., an
   embodiment described before the referenced embodiment), unless expressly specified
   otherwise. Similarly, the mere fact that two (or more) embodiments are referenced does not
30 imply that those embodiments are mutually exclusive.
   [0054]     One embodiment of the invention may include or cover or embrace more than one
   other embodiment of the invention. For example, a first embodiment comprising elements a,
                                                      20

   b, and c may cover a second embodiment that comprises elements a, b, c, and d as well as a
   third embodiment covering elements a, b, c, and e. Similarly, each of the first, second, and
   third embodiments may cover a fourth embodiment comprising elements a, b, c, d, and e.
 5 [0055]    The terms "including", "comprising" and variations thereof mean "including but not
   necessarily limited to", unless expressly specified otherwise. Thus, for example, the sentence
   "the machine includes a red widget and a blue widget" means the machine includes the red
   widget and the blue widget, but may possibly include one or more other items as well.
10 [0056]    The term "consisting of' and variations thereof mean "including and also limited
   to", unless expressly specified otherwise. Thus, for example, the sentence "the machine
   consists of a red widget and a blue widget" means the machine includes the red widget and
   the blue widget, but does not include anything else.
15 [0057]    The term "compose" and variations thereof mean "to make up the constituent parts
   of, component of or member of', unless expressly specified otherwise. Thus, for example,
   the sentence "the red widget and the blue widget compose a machine" means the machine
   includes the red widget and the blue widget.
20 [0058]    The term "exclusively compose" and variations thereof mean "to make up
   exclusively the constituent parts of, to be the only components of, or to be the only members
   of', unless expressly specified otherwise. Thus, for example, the sentence "the red widget
   and the blue widget exclusively compose a machine" means the machine consists of the red
   widget and the blue widget (i.e. and nothing else).
25
   [0059]    The terms "a", "an" and "the" refer to "one or more", unless expressly specified
   otherwise. Thus, for example, the phrase "a widget" means one or more widgets, unless
   expressly specified otherwise. Similarly, after reciting the phrase "a widget", a subsequent
   recitation of the phrase "the widget" means "the one or more widgets". Accordingly, it
30 should be understood that the word "the" may also refer to a specific term having antecedent
   basis. For example, if a paragraph mentions "a specific single feature" and then refers to "the
   feature," then the phrase "the feature" should be understood to refer to the previously
   mentioned "a specific single feature." (It should be understood that the term "a" in "a
                                                     21

   specific single feature" refers to "one" specific single feature and not "one or more" specific
   single features.)
   [0060]    The term "plurality" means "two or more", unless expressly specified otherwise.
 5
   [0061]    The term "herein" means "in the present application, including anything which may
   be incorporated by reference", unless expressly specified otherwise.
   [0062]    The phrase "at least one of', when such phrase modifies a plurality of things (such
10 as an enumerated list of things), means any combination of one or more of those things,
   unless expressly specified otherwise. For example, the phrase "at least one of a widget, a car
   and a wheel" means either (i) a widget, (ii) a car, (iii) a wheel, (iv) a widget and a car, (v) a
   widget and a wheel, (vi) a car and a wheel, or (vii) a widget, a car and a wheel. The phrase
   "at least one of', when such phrase modifies a plurality of things does not mean "one of each
15 of' the plurality of things. For example, the phrase "at least one of a widget, a car and a
   wheel" does not mean "one widget, one car and one wheel".
   [0063]    Numerical terms such as "one ", "two ", etc. when used as cardinal numbers to
   indicate quantity of something (e.g., one widget, two widgets), mean the quantity indicated
20 by that numerical term, but do not mean at least the quantity indicated by that numerical term.
   For example, the phrase "one widget" does not mean "at least one widget", and therefore the
   phrase "one widget" does not cover, e.g., two widgets.
   [0064]    The phrase "based on" does not mean "based only on", unless expressly specified
25 otherwise. In other words, the phrase "based on" covers both "based only on" and "based at
   least on". The phrase "based at least on" is equivalent to the phrase "based at least in part
   on". For example, the phrase "element A is calculated based on element B and element C"
   covers embodiments where element A is calculated as the product of B times C (in other
   words, A = B x C), embodiments where A is calculated as the sum of B plus C (in other
30 words, A = B + C), embodiments where A is calculated as a product of B times C times D,
   embodiments where A is calculated as a sum of the square root of B plus C plus D times E,
   and so on.
   [0065]    The term "represent" and like terms are not exclusive, unless expressly specified
35 otherwise. For example, the term "represents" does not mean "represents only", unless
                                                     22

   expressly specified otherwise. For example, the phrase "the data represents a credit card
   number" covers both "the data represents only a credit card number" and "the data represents
   a credit card number and the data also represents something else".
 5 [0066]      The term "whereby" is used herein only to precede a clause or other set of words
   that express only the intended result, objective or consequence of something that is explicitly
   recited before the term "whereby". Thus, when the term "whereby" is used in a claim, the
   clause or other words that the term "whereby" modifies do not establish specific further
   limitations of the claim or otherwise restrict the meaning or scope of the claim.
10
   [0067]      The terms "e.g.", "such as" and like terms mean "for example", and thus do not
   limit the term or phrase they explain. For example, in the sentence "the computer sends data
   (e.g., instructions, a data structure) over the Internet", the term "e.g." explains that
   "instructions" are an example of "data" that the computer may send over the Internet, and
15 also explains that "a data structure" is an example of "data" that the computer may send over
   the Internet. However, both "instructions" and "a data structure" are merely examples of
   "data", and other things besides "instructions" and "a data structure" can be "data".
   [0068]      The term "respective" and like terms mean "taken individually". Thus if two or
20 more things have "respective" characteristics, then each such thing has its own characteristic,
   and these characteristics can be different from each other but need not be. For example, the
   phrase "each of two machines has a respective function" means that the first of the two
   machines has a function and the second of the two machines has a function as well. The
   function of the first machine may or may not be the same as the function of the second
25 machine.
   [0069]      The term "i.e." and like terms mean "that is", and thus limits the term or phrase it
   explains. For example, in the sentence "the computer sends data (i.e., instructions) over the
   Internet", the term "i.e." explains that "instructions" are the "data" that the computer sends
30 over the Internet.
   [0070]      A numerical range includes integers and non-integers in the range, unless expressly
   specified otherwise. For example, the range "1 to 10" includes the integers from 1 to 10 (e.g.,
    1, 2, 3, 4, ... 9, 10) and non-integers (e.g., 1.0031415926, 1.1, 1.2, ... 1.9).
                                                        23

   [0071]    Where two or more terms or phrases are synonymous (e.g., because of an explicit
   statement that the terms or phrases are synonymous), instances of one such term or phrase
   does not mean instances of another such term or phrase must have a different meaning. For
   example, where a statement renders the meaning of "including" to be synonymous with
 5 "including but not limited to", the mere usage of the phrase "including but not limited to"
   does not mean that the term "including" means something other than "including but not
   limited to".
         II.       Determining
10 [0072]    The term "determining" and grammatical variants thereof (e.g., to determine a price,
   determining a value, the determination of an object which meets a certain criterion) is used in
   an extremely broad sense. The term "determining" encompasses a wide variety of actions
   and therefore "determining" can include calculating, computing, processing, deriving,
   investigating, looking up (e.g., looking up in a table, a database or another data structure),
15 rendering into electronic format or digital representation, ascertaining and the like. Also,
   "determining" can include receiving (e.g., receiving information), accessing (e.g., accessing
   data in a memory) and the like. Also, "determining" can include resolving, selecting,
   choosing, establishing, and the like.
20 [0073]    The term "determining" does not imply certainty or absolute precision, and
   therefore "determining" can include estimating, extrapolating, predicting, guessing, averaging
   and the like.
   [0074]    The term "determining" does not imply that mathematical processing must be
25 performed, and does not imply that numerical methods must be used, and does not imply that
   an algorithm is used.
   [0075]    The term "determining" does not imply that any particular device must be used. For
   example, a computer need not necessarily perform the determining.
30
   [0076]     The term "determining" may include "calculating". The term "calculating" should
   be understood to include performing one or more calculations. Calculating may include
   computing, processing, and/or deriving. Calculating may be performed by a computing
   device. For example, calculating a thing may include applying an algorithm to data by a
35 computer processor and generating the thing as an output of the processor.
                                                     24

   [0077]     The term "determining" may include "referencing". The term "referencing" should
   be understood to include making one or more reference, e.g., to a thing. Referencing may
   include querying, accessing, selecting, choosing, reading, and/or looking-up. The act of
   referencing may be performed by a computing device. For example, referencing a thing may
 5 include reading a memory location in which the thing is stored by a processor.
   [0078]     The term "determining" may include "receiving". For example, receiving a thing
   may include taking in the thing. In some embodiments, receiving may include acts
   performed to take in a thing, such as operating a network interface through which the thing is
10 taken in. In some embodiments, receiving may be performed without acts performed to take
   in the thing, such as in a direct memory write or a hard wired circuit. Receiving a thing may
   include receiving a thing from a remote source that may have calculated the thing.
         III.      Forms of Sentences
15 [0079]     Where a limitation of a first claim would cover one of a feature as well as more than
   one of a feature (e.g., a limitation such as "at least one widget" covers one widget as well as
   more than one widget), and where in a second claim that depends on the first claim, the
   second claim uses a definite article "the" to refer to that limitation (e.g., "the widget"), this
   mere usage does not imply that the first claim covers only one of the feature, and this does
20 not imply that the second claim covers only one of the feature (e.g., "the widget" can cover
   both one widget and more than one widget).
   [0080]     When an ordinal number (such as "first", "second", "third" and so on) is used as an
   adjective before a term, that ordinal number is used (unless expressly specified otherwise)
25 merely to indicate a particular feature, such as to distinguish that particular feature from
   another feature that is described by the same term or by a similar term, but that ordinal
   number does not have any other meaning or limiting effect - it is merely a convenient name.
   For example, a "first widget" may be so named merely to distinguish it from, e.g., a "second
   widget". Thus, the mere usage of the ordinal numbers "first" and "second" before the term
30 "widget" does not indicate any other relationship between the two widgets, and likewise does
   not indicate any other characteristics of either or both widgets. For example, the mere usage
   of the ordinal numbers "first" and "second" before the term "widget" (1) does not indicate
   that either widget comes before or after any other in order or location; (2) does not indicate
   that either widget occurs or acts before or after any other in time; and (3) does not indicate
                                                       25

   that either widget ranks above or below any other, as in importance or quality. The mere
   usage of ordinal numbers does not define a numerical limit to the features identified with the
   ordinal numbers. For example, the mere usage of the ordinal numbers "first" and "second"
   before the term "widget" does not indicate that there are exactly two widgets.
 5
   [0081]    When a single device, article or other product is described herein, in another
   embodiment more than one device or article (whether or not they cooperate) may
   alternatively be used in place of the single device or article that is described. Accordingly,
   the functionality that is described as being possessed by a device may alternatively be
10 possessed by more than one device or article (whether or not they cooperate) in another
   embodiment.
   [0082]    Similarly, where more than one device, article or other product is described herein
   (whether or not they cooperate), in another embodiment a single device or article may
15 alternatively be used in place of the more than one device or article that is described. For
   example, a plurality of computer-based devices may be substituted with a single computer
   based device. In some embodiments, such a plurality of computer-based devices may operate
   together to perform one step of a process such as is common in grid computing systems. In
   some embodiments, such a plurality of computer-based devices may operate provide added
20 functionality to one another so that the plurality may operate to perform one step of a process
   such as is common in cloud computing systems. (Conversely, a single computer-based
   device may be substituted with multiple computer-based devices operating in cooperation
   with one another. For example, a single computing device may be substituted with a server
   and a workstation in communication with one another over the internet) Accordingly, the
25 various functionality that is described as being possessed by more than one device or article
   may alternatively be possessed by a single device or article.
   [0083]    The functionality and/or the features of a single device that is described may, in
   another embodiment, be alternatively embodied by one or more other devices which are
30 described but are not explicitly described as having such functionality or features. Thus,
   other embodiments need not include the described device itself, but rather can include the one
   or more other devices which would, in those other embodiments, have such functionality or
   features.
                                                     26

          IV.       Disclosed Examples and Terminology Are Not Limiting
   [0084]     Neither the Title (set forth at the beginning of the first page of the present
   application) nor the Abstract (set forth at the end of the present application) is to be taken as
   limiting in any way the scope of the disclosed invention, is to be used in interpreting the
 5 meaning of any claim or is to be used in limiting the scope of any claim. An Abstract has
   been included in this application merely because an Abstract is required under 37 C.F.R. 
    1.72(b).
   [0085]     The headings of sections provided in the present application are for convenience
10 only, and are not to be taken as limiting the disclosure in any way.
   [0086]     Numerous embodiments are described in the present application, and are presented
   for illustrative purposes only. The described embodiments are not, and are not intended to be,
   limiting in any sense. The disclosed invention is widely applicable to numerous
15 embodiments, as is readily apparent from the disclosure. One of ordinary skill in the art will
   recognize that the disclosed invention may be practiced with various modifications and
   alterations, such as structural, logical, software, and electrical modifications. Although
   particular features of the disclosed invention may be described with reference to one or more
   particular embodiments and/or drawings, it should be understood that such features are not
20 limited to usage in the one or more particular embodiments or drawings with reference to
   which they are described, unless expressly specified otherwise.
   [0087]     Though an embodiment may be disclosed as including several features, other
   embodiments of the invention may include fewer than all such features. Thus, for example, a
25 claim may be directed to less than the entire set of features in a disclosed embodiment, and
   such claim would not be interpreted as requiring features beyond those features that the claim
   expressly recites.
   [0088]     No embodiment of method steps or product elements described in the present
30 application constitutes the invention claimed herein, or is essential to the invention claimed
   herein, or is coextensive with the invention claimed herein, except where it is either expressly
   stated to be so in this specification or (with respect to a claim and the invention defined by
   that claim) expressly recited in that claim.
                                                       27

   [0089]     Any preambles of the claims that recite anything other than a statutory class shall be
   interpreted to recite purposes, benefits and possible uses of the claimed invention, and such
   preambles shall not be construed to limit the claimed invention.
 5 [0090]     The present disclosure is not a literal description of all embodiments of the
   invention. Also, the present disclosure is not a listing of features of the invention which must
   be present in all embodiments.
   [0091]     All disclosed embodiments are not necessarily covered by the claims (even
10 including all pending, amended, issued and canceled claims). In addition, a disclosed
   embodiment may be (but need not necessarily be) covered by several claims. Accordingly,
   where a claim (regardless of whether pending, amended, issued or canceled) is directed to a
   particular embodiment, such is not evidence that the scope of other claims do not also cover
   that embodiment.
15
   [0092]     Devices that are described as in communication with each other need not be in
   continuous communication with each other, unless expressly specified otherwise. On the
   contrary, such devices need only transmit to each other as necessary or desirable, and may
   actually refrain from exchanging data most of the time. For example, a machine in
20 communication with another machine via the Internet may not transmit data to the other
   machine for long period of time (e.g. weeks at a time). In addition, devices that are in
   communication with each other may communicate directly or indirectly through one or more
   intermediaries. Devices are in communication with one another if they are capable of at least
   one-way communication with one another. For example, a first device is in communication
25 with a second device if the first device is capable of transmitting information to the second
   device. Similarly, the second device is in communication with the first device if the second
   device is capable of receiving information from the first device.
   [0093]     A description of an embodiment with several components or features does not imply
30 that all or even any of such components or features are required. On the contrary, a variety of
   optional components are described to illustrate the wide variety of possible embodiments of
   the present invention. Unless otherwise specified explicitly, no component or feature is
   essential or required.
                                                       28

   [0094]     Although process steps, algorithms or the like may be described or claimed in a
   particular sequential order, such processes may be configured to work in different orders. In
   other words, any sequence or order of steps that may be explicitly described or claimed does
   not necessarily indicate a requirement that the steps be performed in that order. The steps of
 5 processes described herein may be performed in any order possible. Further, some steps may
   be performed simultaneously despite being described or implied as occurring non
   simultaneously (e.g., because one step is described after the other step). Moreover, the
   illustration of a process by its depiction in a drawing does not imply that the illustrated
   process is exclusive of other variations and modifications thereto, does not imply that the
10 illustrated process or any of its steps are necessary to the invention, and does not imply that
   the illustrated process is preferred.
   [0095]     Although a process may be described as including a plurality of steps, that does not
   imply that all or any of the steps are preferred, essential or required. Various other
15 embodiments within the scope of the described invention include other processes that omit
   some or all of the described steps. Unless otherwise specified explicitly, no step is essential
   or required.
   [0096]     Although a process may be described singly or without reference to other products
20 or methods, in an embodiment the process may interact with other products or methods. For
   example, such interaction may include linking one business model to another business model.
   Such interaction may be provided to enhance the flexibility or desirability of the process.
   [0097]     Although a product may be described as including a plurality of components,
25 aspects, qualities, characteristics and/or features, that does not indicate that any or all of the
   plurality are preferred, essential or required. Various other embodiments within the scope of
   the described invention include other products that omit some or all of the described plurality.
   [0098]     An enumerated list of items (which may or may not be numbered) does not imply
30 that any or all of the items are mutually exclusive, unless expressly specified otherwise.
   Likewise, an enumerated list of items (which may or may not be numbered) does not imply
   that any or all of the items are comprehensive of any category, unless expressly specified
   otherwise. For example, the enumerated list "a computer, a laptop, and a PDA" does not
   imply that any or all of the three items of that list are mutually exclusive and does not imply
35 that any or all of the three items of that list are comprehensive of any category.
                                                        29

   [0099]     An enumerated list of items (which may or may not be numbered) does not imply
   that any or all of the items are equivalent to each other or readily substituted for each other.
   [0100]     All embodiments are illustrative, and do not imply that the invention or any
 5 embodiments were made or performed, as the case may be.
          V.         Computing
   [0102]     It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various
   processes described herein may be implemented by, e.g., appropriately programmed general
10 purpose computers, special purpose computers and computing devices. Typically a processor
   (e.g., one or more microprocessors, one or more microcontrollers, one or more digital signal
   processors) will receive instructions (e.g., from a memory or like device), and execute those
   instructions, thereby performing one or more processes defined by those instructions.
   Instructions may be embodied in, e.g., one or more computer programs, one or more scripts.
15
   [0103]      The term "compute" shall mean to determine using a processor in accordance with
   a software algorithm.
   [0104]     A "processor" means one or more microprocessors, central processing units (CPUs),
20 computing devices, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, graphics processing units
   (GPUs) or like devices or any combination thereof, regardless of the architecture (e.g., chip
   level multiprocessing or multi-core, RISC, CISC, Microprocessor without Interlocked
   Pipeline Stages, pipelining configuration, simultaneous multithreading, microprocessor with
   integrated graphics processing unit, GPGPU).
25
   [0105]     A "computing device" means one or more microprocessors, central processing units
   (CPUs), computing devices, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, graphics card, mobile
   gaming device, or like devices or any combination thereof, regardless of the architecture
   (e.g., chip-level multiprocessing or multi-core, RISC, CISC, Microprocessor without
30 Interlocked Pipeline Stages, pipelining configuration, simultaneous multithreading).
   [0106]     Thus a description of a process is likewise a description of an apparatus for
   performing the process. The apparatus that performs the process can include, e.g., a
   processor and those input devices and output devices that are appropriate to perform the
35 process. For example, a description of a process is a description of an apparatus comprising a
                                                      30

   processor and memory that stores a program comprising instructions that, when executed by
   the processor, direct the processor to perform the method.
   [0107]     The apparatus that performs the process can include a plurality of computing
 5 devices that work together to perform the process. Some of the computing devices may work
   together to perform each step of a process, may work on separate steps of a process, may
   provide underlying services that other computing devices that may facilitate the performance
   of the process. Such computing devices may act under instruction of a centralized authority.
   In another embodiment, such computing devices may act without instruction of a centralized
10 authority. Some examples of apparatus that may operate in some or all of these ways may
   include grid computer systems, cloud computer systems, peer-to-peer computer systems,
   computer systems configured to provide software as a service, and so on. For example, the
   apparatus may comprise a computer system that executes the bulk of its processing load on a
   remote server but outputs display information to and receives user input information from a
15 local user computer, such as a computer system that executes VMware software.
   [0108]     Further, programs that implement such methods (as well as other types of data) may
   be stored and transmitted using a variety of media (e.g., computer readable media) in a
   number of manners. In some embodiments, hard-wired circuitry or custom hardware may be
20 used in place of, or in combination with, some or all of the software instructions that can
   implement the processes of various embodiments. Thus, various combinations of hardware
   and software may be used instead of software only.
   [0109]     The term "computer-readable medium" refers to any non-transitory medium, a
25 plurality of the same, or a combination of different media, that participate in providing data
   (e.g., instructions, data structures) which may be read by a computer, a processor or a like
   device. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile
   media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example,
   optical or magnetic disks and other persistent memory. Volatile media include dynamic
30 random access memory (DRAM), which typically constitutes the main memory.
   Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires
   that comprise a system bus coupled to the processor. Transmission media may include or
   convey acoustic waves, light waves and electromagnetic emissions, such as those generated
   during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of
                                                     31

   computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk,
   magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD, any other optical medium,
   punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM,
   an EPROM, a FLASH-EEPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as
 5 described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read.
   [0110]    The term "tangible computer-readable medium" refers to a "computer-readable
   medium" that comprises a hardware component, such as optical or magnetic disks.
10 [0111]    Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying data (e.g.
   sequences of instructions) to a processor. For example, data may be (i) delivered from RAM
   to a processor; (ii) carried over a wireless transmission medium; (iii) formatted and/or
   transmitted according to numerous formats, standards or protocols, such as Ethernet (or IEEE
   802.3), wireless local area network communication defined by the IEEE 802.11 specifications
15 whether or not they are approved by the WiFi Alliance, SAP, ATP, BluetoothTM, and
   TCP/IP, TDMA, CDMA, and 3G; and/or (iv) encrypted to ensure privacy or prevent fraud in
   any of a variety of ways well known in the art.
   [0112]    The term "database" refers to any electronically-stored collection of data that is
20 stored in a retrievable format.
   [0113]    The term "data structure" refers to a database in a hardware machine such as a
   computer.
25 [0114]    The term "network" means a series of points or nodes interconnected by
   communication paths. For example, a network can include a plurality of computers or
   communication devices interconnected by one or more wired and/or wireless communication
   paths. Networks can interconnect with other networks and contain subnetworks.
30 [0115]    The term "predetermined" means determined beforehand, e.g., before a present time
   or a present action. For example, the phrase "displaying a predetermined value" means
   displaying a value that was determined before the act of displaying.
                                                      32

   [0116]     The term "condition" means (1) a premise upon which the fulfillment of an
   agreement depends, or (2) something essential to the appearance or occurrence of something
   else.
 5 [0117]     The term "transaction" means (1) an exchange or transfer of goods, services, or
   funds, or (2) a communicative action or activity involving two parties or things that
   reciprocally affect or influence each other.
   [0118]     Thus a description of a process is likewise a description of a computer-readable
10 medium storing a program for performing the process. The computer-readable medium can
   store (in any appropriate format) those program elements which are appropriate to perform
   the method. For example, a description of a process is a description of a computer-readable
   storage medium that stores a program comprising instructions that, when executed by a
   processor, direct the processor to perform the method.
15
   [0119]     Just as the description of various steps in a process does not indicate that all the
   described steps are required, embodiments of an apparatus include a computer or computing
   device operable to perform some (but not necessarily all) of the described process.
20 [0120]     Likewise, just as the description of various steps in a process does not indicate that
   all the described steps are required, embodiments of a computer-readable medium storing a
   program or data structure include a computer-readable medium storing a program that, when
   executed, can cause a processor to perform some (but not necessarily all) of the described
   process.
25
   [0121]     Where databases are described, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the
   art that (i) alternative database structures to those described may be readily employed, and (ii)
   other memory structures besides databases may be readily employed. Any illustrations or
   descriptions of any sample databases presented herein are illustrative arrangements for stored
30 representations of information. Any number of other arrangements may be employed besides
   those suggested by, e.g., tables illustrated in drawings or elsewhere. Similarly, any illustrated
   entries of the databases represent exemplary information only; one of ordinary skill in the art
   will understand that the number and content of the entries can be different from those
                                                       33

   described herein. Further, despite any depiction of the databases as tables, other formats
   (including relational databases, object-based models and/or distributed databases) could be
   used to store and manipulate the data types described herein. Likewise, object methods or
   behaviors of a database can be used to implement various processes, such as the described
 5 herein. In addition, the databases may, in a known manner, be stored locally or remotely
   from a device which accesses data in such a database.
   [0122]     Various embodiments can be configured to work in a network environment
   including a computer that is in communication (e.g., via a communications network) with one
10 or more devices. The computer may communicate with the devices directly or indirectly, via
   any wired or wireless medium (e.g. the Internet, LAN, WAN or Ethernet, Token Ring, a
   telephone line, a cable line, a radio channel, an optical communications line, commercial on
   line service providers, bulletin board systems, a satellite communications link, a combination
   of any of the above). Each of the devices may themselves comprise computers or other
15 computing devices, such as those based on the Intel*, Pentium, or Centrinom, AtomTM       or
   CoreTm processor, that are adapted to communicate with the computer. Any number and type
   of devices may be in communication with the computer.
   [0123]     In an embodiment, a server computer or centralized authority may not be necessary
20 or desirable. For example, the present invention may, in an embodiment, be practiced on one
   or more devices without a central authority. In such an embodiment, any functions described
   herein as performed by the server computer or data described as stored on the server
   computer may instead be performed by or stored on one or more such devices.
25 [0124]     Where a process is described, in an embodiment the process may operate without
   any user intervention. In another embodiment, the process includes some human intervention
   (e.g., a step is performed by or with the assistance of a human).
   [0125]     As used herein, the term "encryption" refers to a process for obscuring or hiding
30 information so that the information is not readily understandable without special knowledge.
   The process of encryption may transform raw information, called plaintext, into encrypted
   information. The encrypted information may be called ciphertext, and the algorithm for
   transforming the plaintext into ciphertext may be referred to as a cipher. A cipher may also
                                                     34

   be used for performing the reverse operation of converting the ciphertext back into plaintext.
   Examples of ciphers include substitution ciphers, transposition ciphers, and ciphers
   implemented using rotor machines.
 5 [0126]     In various encryption methods, ciphers may require a supplementary piece of
   information called a key. A key may consist, for example, of a string of bits. A key may be
   used in conjunction with a cipher to encrypt plaintext. A key may also be used in conjunction
   with a cipher to decrypt ciphertext. In a category of ciphers called symmetric key algorithms
   (e.g., private-key cryptography), the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
10 The sanctity of the encrypted information may thus depend on the key being kept secret.
   Examples of symmetric key algorithms are DES and AES. In a category of ciphers called
   asymmetric key algorithms (e.g., public-key cryptography), different keys are used for
   encryption and decryption. With an asymmetric key algorithm, any member of the public
   may use a first key (e.g., a public key) to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext. However, only the
15 holder of a second key (e.g., the private key) will be able to decrypt the ciphertext back in to
   plaintext. An example of an asymmetric key algorithm is the RSA algorithm.
          VI.       Continuing Applications
   [0127]     The present disclosure provides, to one of ordinary skill in the art, an enabling
20 description of several embodiments and/or inventions. Some of these embodiments and/or
   inventions may not be claimed in the present application, but may nevertheless be claimed in
   one or more continuing applications that claim the benefit of priority of the present
   application.
25 [0128]     Applicants intend to file additional applications to pursue patents for subject matter
   that has been disclosed and enabled but not claimed in the present application.
          VII.      35 U.S.C.  112, paragraph 6
   [0129]     In a claim, a limitation of the claim which includes the phrase "means for" or the
30 phrase "step for" means that 35 U.S.C.  112, paragraph 6, applies to that limitation.
   [0130]     In a claim, a limitation of the claim which does not include the phrase "means for"
   or the phrase "step for" means that 35 U.S.C.  112, paragraph 6 does not apply to that
                                                      35

   limitation, regardless of whether that limitation recites a function without recitation of
   structure, material or acts for performing that function. For example, in a claim, the mere use
   of the phrase "step of' or the phrase "steps of' in referring to one or more steps of the claim
   or of another claim does not mean that 35 U.S.C.  112, paragraph 6, applies to that step(s).
 5
   [0131]    With respect to a means or a step for performing a specified function in accordance
   with 35 U.S.C.  112, paragraph 6, the corresponding structure, material or acts described in
   the specification, and equivalents thereof, may perform additional functions as well as the
   specified function.
10
   [0132]    Computers, processors, computing devices and like products are structures that can
   perform a wide variety of functions. Such products can be operable to perform a specified
   function by executing one or more programs, such as a program stored in a memory device of
   that product or in a memory device which that product accesses. Unless expressly specified
15 otherwise, such a program need not be based on any particular algorithm, such as any
   particular algorithm that might be disclosed in the present application. It is well known to
   one of ordinary skill in the art that a specified function may be implemented via different
   algorithms, and any of a number of different algorithms would be a mere design choice for
   carrying out the specified function.
20
   [0133]    Therefore, with respect to a means or a step for performing a specified function in
   accordance with 35 U.S.C.  112, paragraph 6, structure corresponding to a specified function
   includes any product programmed to perform the specified function. Such structure includes
   programmed products which perform the function, regardless of whether such product is
25 programmed with (i) a disclosed algorithm for performing the function, (ii) an algorithm that
   is similar to a disclosed algorithm, or (iii) a different algorithm for performing the function.
   [0134]    Where there is recited a means for performing a function that is a method, one
   structure for performing this method includes a computing device (e.g., a general purpose
30 computer) that is programmed and/or configured with appropriate hardware to perform that
   function.
                                                        36

   [0135]     Also included is a computing device (e.g., a general purpose computer) that is
   programmed and/or configured with appropriate hardware to perform that function via other
   algorithms as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.
 5        VIII.     Disclaimer
   [0136]     Numerous references to a particular embodiment do not indicate a disclaimer or
   disavowal of additional, different embodiments, and similarly references to the description of
   embodiments which all include a particular feature do not indicate a disclaimer or disavowal
   of embodiments which do not include that particular feature. A clear disclaimer or disavowal
10 in the present application will be prefaced by the phrase "does not include" or by the phrase
   "cannot perform".
          IX.       Incorporation By Reference
   [0137]     Any patent, patent application or other document referred to herein is incorporated
15 by reference into this patent application as part of the present disclosure, but only for
   purposes of written description and enablement in accordance with 35 U.S.C.  112,
   paragraph 1, and should in no way be used to limit, define, or otherwise construe any term of
   the present application, unless without such incorporation by reference, no ordinary meaning
   would have been ascertainable by a person of ordinary skill in the art. Such person of
20 ordinary skill in the art need not have been in any way limited by any embodiments provided
   in the reference. Conversely, the definitions provided in this application should not be used
   to limit, define, or otherwise construe any term of any document incorporated herein by
   reference. The definitions set forth explicitly in this application are controlling

25 definition(s).
   [0138]     Any incorporation by reference does not, in and of itself, imply any endorsement of,
   ratification of or acquiescence in any statements, opinions, arguments or characterizations
   contained in any incorporated patent, patent application or other document, unless explicitly
30 specified otherwise in this patent application.
          X.        Prosecution History
                                                     37

  [0139]     In interpreting the present application (which includes the claims), one of ordinary
  skill in the art refers to the prosecution history of the present application, but not to the
  prosecution history of any other patent or patent application, regardless of whether there are
  other patent applications that are considered related to the present application, and regardless
5 of whether there are other patent applications that share a claim of priority with the present
  application.
                                                      38

        4. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the apparatus is re-configurable such that:
                all data received by the first network interface from the first network is
