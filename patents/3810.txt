                                       Field of the Invention
 [0002]          The invention relates generally to activatable antibodies that specifically bind
 to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), conjugated activatable antibodies that
 specifically bind to EGFR, and methods of making and using these anti-EGFR activatable
 antibodies and/or conjugated anti-EGFR activatable antibodies in a variety of therapeutic,
 diagnostic and prophylactic indications.
                                  Background of the Invention
 [0003]          Antibody-based therapies have proven effective treatments for some diseases
 but in some cases, toxicities due to broad target expression have limited their therapeutic
 effectiveness. In addition, antibody-based therapeutics have exhibited other limitations
 such as rapid clearance from the circulation following administration.
 [0004]          In the realm of small molecule therapeutics, strategies have been developed
 to provide prodrugs of an active chemical entity. Such prodrugs are administered in a
 relatively inactive (or significantly less active) form. Once administered, the prodrug is
 metabolized in vivo into the active compound. Such prodrug strategies can provide for
 increased selectivity of the drug for its intended target and for a reduction of adverse effects.
 [0005]          Accordingly, there is a continued need in the field of antibody-based
 therapeutics for antibodies that mimic the desirable characteristics of the small molecule
 prodrug.

WO 2013/163631                                                                PCT/US2013/038540
                                   Summary of the Invention
 [00061           The invention provides activatable antibodies that include an antibody or
 antigen-binding fragment thereof that specifically binds epidermal growth factor receptor
 (EGFR) coupled to a masking moiety (MM), such that coupling of the MM reduces the
 ability of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof to bind EGFR. In a preferred
 embodiment, the MM is coupled via a sequence that includes a substrate for a protease, for
 example, a protease that is co-localized with EGFR at a treatment site in a subject. The
 activatable anti-EGFR antibodies provided herein are stable in circulation, activated at
 intended sites of therapy and/or diagnosis but not in normal, i.e., healthy tissue, and, when
 activated, exhibit binding to EGFR that is at least comparable to the corresponding,
 unmodified antibody.
 [0007]           The invention provides conjugated activatable antibodies that include an
 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that specifically binds epidermal growth
 factor receptor (EGFR) coupled to a masking moiety (MM), such that coupling of the MM
 reduces the ability of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof to bind EGFR, and
 wherein the activatable antibody is conjugated to one or more additional agents. In a
 preferred embodiment of the conjugated activatable antibodies, the MM is coupled via a
 sequence that includes a substrate for a protease, for example, a protease that is co-localized
 with EGFR at a treatment site in a subject. The conjugated, activatable anti-EGFR
 antibodies provided herein are stable in circulation, activated at intended sites of therapy
 and/or diagnosis but not in normal, i.e., healthy tissue, and, when activated, exhibit binding
 to EGFR that is at least comparable to the corresponding, unmodified antibody.
 [0008]           The invention provides methods of treating, preventing and/or delaying the
 onset or progression of, or alleviating a symptom of an indication, e.g., disease or disorder,
 associated with aberrant expression and/or activity of EGFR, e.g., an EGFR-related
 disorder, in a subject using a therapeutic molecule, e.g., activatable antibodies that in an
 activated state bind EGFR and/or conjugated activatable antibodies that in an activated state
 bind EGFR, particularly activatable antibodies and/or conjugated activatable antibodies that
 when activated bind and neutralize or otherwise inhibit at least one biological activity of
 EGFR and/or EGFR-mediated signaling.
 [0009]           The activatable antibodies described herein in an activated state bind EGFR
 and include (i) an antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof (AB) that specifically
                                                 2

WO 2013/163631                                                                  PCT/US2013/038540
 binds to EGFR, wherein the AB is or is derived from cetuximab; (ii) a masking moiety
 (MM) that inhibits the binding of the AB of the activatable antibody in an uncleaved state to
 EGFR; and (c) a cleavable moiety (CM) coupled to the AB, wherein the CM is a
 polypeptide that functions as a substrate for a protease.
 [0010]           In some embodiments, the MM has an equilibrium dissociation constant for
 binding to the AB which is greater than the equilibrium dissociation constant of the AB to
 EGFR.
 [0011]           In some embodiments, the MM has an equilibrium dissociation constant for
 binding to the AB which is no more than the equilibrium dissociation constant of the AB to
 EGFR.
 [0012]           In some embodiments, the MM does not interfere or compete with the AB of
 the activatable antibody in a cleaved state for binding to EGFR.
 [00131           In some embodiments, the protease is co-localized with EGFR in a tissue,
 and the protease cleaves the CM in the activatable antibody when the activatable antibody is
 exposed to the protease. In some embodiments, the protease is not active or is significantly
 less active in tissues that do not significantly express EGFR. In some embodiments, the
 protease is not active or is significantly less active in healthy, e.g., non-diseased tissues.
 [0014]           In some embodiments, the activatable antibody in the uncleaved state has the
 structural arrangement from N-terminus to C-terminus as follows: MM-CM-AB or AB-CM
 MM.
 [0015]           In some embodiments, the activatable antibody includes a linking peptide
 between the MM and the CM.
 [00161           In some embodiments, the activatable antibody includes a linking peptide
 between the CM and the AB.
 [0017]           In some embodiments, the activatable antibody includes a first linking
 peptide (LP1) and a second linking peptide (LP2), and wherein the activatable antibody in
 the uncleaved state has the structural arrangement from N-terminus to C-terminus as
 follows: MM-LP1-CM-LP2-AB or AB-LP2-CM-LP 1-MM. In some embodiments, the two
 linking peptides need not be identical to each other.
 [0018]           In some embodiments, the AB has an equilibrium dissociation constant of
 about 100 nM or less for binding to EGFR.
 [0019]           In some embodiments, the MM is a polypeptide of about 2 to 40 amino acids
 in length, for example, no more than 40 amino acids long.

 [0020]           In some embodiments, the MM polypeptide sequence is different from that
 of EGFR, and the MM polypeptide sequence is no more than 50% identical to any natural
 binding partner of the AB.
 [0021]           In some embodiments, the CM is positioned in the activatable antibody such
 that in the uncleaved state, binding of the activatable antibody to EGFR is reduced to occur
 with an equilibrium dissociation constant that is at least 20-fold greater than the equilibrium
 dissociation constant of an unmodified AB binding to EGFR, and whereas the AB of the
 activatable antibody in the cleaved state binds EGFR.
 [0022]           In some embodiments, the CM is positioned in the activatable antibody such
 that in the uncleaved state, binding of the activatable antibody to EGFR is reduced to occur
 with an equilibrium dissociation constant that is at least 100-fold greater than the
 equilibrium dissociation constant of an unmodified AB binding to EGFR, and whereas the
 AB of the activatable antibody in the cleaved state binds EGFR.
 [00231           In some embodiments, the CM is positioned in the activatable antibody such
 that in the uncleaved state, binding of the activatable antibody to EGFR is reduced to occur
 with an equilibrium dissociation constant that is at least 200-fold greater than the
 equilibrium dissociation constant of an unmodified AB binding to EGFR, and whereas the
 AB of the activatable antibody in the cleaved state binds EGFR.
 [0024]           In some embodiments, the coupling of the MM reduces the ability of the AB
 to bind EGFR such that the dissociation constant (Kd) of the AB when coupled to the MM
 towards EGFR is at least 20 times greater than the Kd of the AB when not coupled to the
 MM towards EGFR. In some embodiments, the coupling of the MM reduces the ability of
 the AB to bind EGFR such that the Kd of the AB when coupled to the MM towards EGFR
 is at least 100 times greater than the Kd of the AB when not coupled to the MM towards
 EGFR. In some embodiments, the coupling of the MM reduces the ability of the AB to
 bind EGFR such that the     Kd of the AB when coupled to the MM towards EGFR is at least
 1000 times greater than the Kd of the AB when not coupled to the MM towards EGFR. In
 some embodiments, the coupling of the MM reduces the ability of the AB to bind EGFR
 such that the  Kd  of the AB when coupled to the MM towards EGFR is at least 10,000 times
 greater than the  Kd  of the AB when not coupled to the MM towards EGFR.
 [0025]           In some embodiments, the CM is a polypeptide of up to 15 amino acids in
 length.

 [0026]          In some embodiments, in the presence of EGFR, the MM reduces the ability
 of the AB to bind EGFR by at least 90% when the CM is uncleaved, as compared to when
 the CM is cleaved when assayed in vitro using a target displacement assay such as, for
 example, the assay described in PCT Publication Nos. WO 2009/025846 and WO

 [001851          In some embodiments, the AB is or is derived from cetuximab,
 [00186]          In some embodiments, the MM has an equilibrium dissociation constant for

 and the protease cleaves the CM in the activatable antibody when the activatable antibody is
 exposed to the protease. In some embodiments, the protease is not active or is significantly
 less active in tissues that do not significantly express EGFR. In some embodiments, the
 protease is not active or is significantly less active in healthy, e.g., non-diseased tissues.

 dissociation constant of an unmodified AB binding to EGFR, and whereas the AB of the
 activatable antibody in the cleaved state binds EGFR.

 that in the uncleaved state, binding of the activatable antibody to EGFR is reduced to occur
 with an equilibrium dissociation constant that is at least 200-fold greater than the
 equilibrium dissociation constant of an unmodified AB binding to EGFR, and whereas the
 AB of the activatable antibody in the cleaved state binds EGFR.
 [00201]          In some embodiments, the coupling of the MM reduces the ability of the AB
 to bind EGFR such that the dissociation constant (Kd) of the AB when coupled to the MM
 towards EGFR is at least 20 times greater than the Kd of the AB when not coupled to the
 MM towards EGFR. In some embodiments, the coupling of the MM reduces the ability of
 the AB to bind EGFR such that the Kd of the AB when coupled to the MM towards EGFR
 is at least 100 times greater than the Kd of the AB when not coupled to the MM towards
 EGFR. In some embodiments, the coupling of the MM reduces the ability of the AB to
 bind EGFR such that the     Kd of the AB when coupled to the MM towards EGFR is at least
 1000 times greater than the Kd of the AB when not coupled to the MM towards EGFR. In
 some embodiments, the coupling of the MM reduces the ability of the AB to bind EGFR
 such that the  Kd  of the AB when coupled to the MM towards EGFR is at least 10,000 times
 greater than the  Kd  of the AB when not coupled to the MM towards EGFR.

 [00284]         The invention also provides methods of detecting presence or absence of a
 cleaving agent in a subject or a sample by (i) contacting a subject or sample with an anti
 EGFR antibody and/or conjugated activatable anti-EGFR antibody; and (ii) measuring a
 level of detectable label in the subject or sample, wherein a detectable level of the
 detectable label in the subject or sample indicates that the cleaving agent is absent in the
 subject or sample and wherein no detectable level of the detectable label in the subject or
 sample indicates that the cleaving agent is present in the subject or sample.
 [00285]         In some embodiments of these methods, the anti-EGFR antibody and/or
 conjugated activatable anti-EGFR antibody includes a detectable label selected from the
 group consisting of an imaging agent, a contrasting agent, an enzyme, a fluorescent label, a
 chromophore, a dye, one or more metal ions, and a ligand-based label. In some
 embodiments of these methods, the imaging agent comprises a radioisotope. In some
 embodiments of these methods, the radioisotope is indium or technetium. In some
 embodiments of these methods, the contrasting agent comprises iodine, gadolinium or iron
 oxide. In some embodiments of these methods, the enzyme comprises horseradish
 peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, or p-galactosidase. In some embodiments of these
 methods, the fluorescent label comprises yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), cyan fluorescent
 protein (CFP), green fluorescent protein (GFP), modified red fluorescent protein (mRFP),
 red fluorescent protein tdimer2 (RFP tdimer2), HCRED, or a europium derivative. In some
 embodiments of these methods, the luminescent label comprises an N- methylacrydium
 derivative. In some embodiments of these methods, the label comprises an Alexa Fluor*
 label, such as Alex Fluor* 680 or Alexa Fluor* 750. In some embodiments of these
 methods, the ligand-based label comprises biotin, avidin, streptavidin or one or more

 [00286]         In some embodiments of these methods, the subject is a mammal. In some
 embodiments of these methods, the subject is a human. In some embodiments, the subject

WO 2013/163631                                                                PCT/US2013/038540
 is a non-human mammal, such as a non-human primate, companion animal (e.g., cat, dog,
 horse), farm animal, work animal, or zoo animal.
 [00287]          In some embodiments of these methods, the method is an in vivo method. In
 some embodiments of these methods, the method is an in situ method. In some
 embodiments of these methods, the method is an ex vivo method. In some embodiments of
 these methods, the method is an in vitro method.
 [00288]          In some embodiments of the methods, the method is used to identify or
 otherwise refine a patient population suitable for treatment with an anti-EGFR antibody
 and/or conjugated activatable anti-EGFR antibody of the disclosure. For example, patients
 that test positive for both the target (e.g., EGFR) and a protease that cleaves the substrate in
 the cleavable moiety (CM) of the anti-EGFR antibody and/or conjugated activatable anti
 EGFR antibody being tested in these methods are identified as suitable candidates for
 treatment with such anti-EGFR antibody and/or such a conjugated activatable anti-EGFR
 antibody comprising such a CM. Likewise, patients that test negative for either or both of
 the target (e.g., EGFR) and the protease that cleaves the substrate in the CM in the
 activatable antibody being tested using these methods are identified as suitable candidates
 for another form of therapy (i.e., not suitable for treatment with the anti-EGFR antibody
 and/or conjugated activatable anti-EGFR antibody being tested). In some embodiments,
 such patients can be tested with other anti-EGFR antibody and/or conjugated activatable
 anti-EGFR antibody until a suitable anti-EGFR antibody and/or conjugated activatable anti
 EGFR antibody for treatment is identified (e.g., an anti-EGFR antibody and/or conjugated
 activatable anti-EGFR antibody comprising a CM that is cleaved by the patient at the site of
 disease).
 [00289]          In some embodiments, the activatable antibody binds EGFR in an activated
 state and includes (i) an antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof (AB) that
 specifically binds to EGFR, wherein the AB is or is derived from cetuximab; (ii) a masking
 moiety (MM) that inhibits the binding of the AB of the activatable antibody in an uncleaved
 state to EGFR; and (c) a cleavable moiety (CM) coupled to the AB, wherein the CM is a
 polypeptide that functions as a substrate for a protease.
 [00290]          In some embodiments, the MM has an equilibrium dissociation constant for
 binding to the AB which is greater than the equilibrium dissociation constant of the AB to
 EGFR. In some embodiments, the MM has an equilibrium dissociation constant for binding
 to the AB which is no more than the equilibrium dissociation constant of the AB to EGFR.

 In some embodiments, the MM does not interfere or compete with the AB of the activatable
 antibody in a cleaved state for binding to EGFR when the activatable antibody is.
 [00291]          In some embodiments, the protease is co-localized with EGFR in a tissue,
 and the protease cleaves the CM in the activatable antibody when the activatable antibody is
 exposed to the protease. In some embodiments, the protease is not active or is significantly
 less active in tissues that do not significantly express EGFR. In some embodiments, the
 protease is not active or is significantly less active in healthy, e.g., non-diseased tissues.
 [00292]          In some embodiments, the activatable antibody and/or conjugated activatable
 antibody has the structural arrangement from N-terminus to C-terminus as follows in the
 uncleaved state: MM-CM-AB or AB-CM-MM.
 [002931          In some embodiments, the activatable antibody and/or conjugated activatable
 antibody includes a linking peptide between the MM and the CM.
 [00294]          In some embodiments, the activatable antibody and/or conjugated activatable
 antibody includes a linking peptide between the CM and the AB.
 [00295]          In some embodiments, the activatable antibody and/or conjugated activatable
 antibody includes a first linking peptide (LP1) and a second linking peptide (LP2), and
 wherein the activatable antibody and/or conjugated activatable antibody has the structural
 arrangement from N-terminus to C-terminus as follows in the uncleaved state: MM-LP 1
 CM-LP2-AB or AB-LP2-CM-LP1-MM. In some embodiments, the two linking peptides
 need not be identical to each other.
 [00296]          In some embodiments, the AB has an equilibrium dissociation constant of
 about 100 nM or less for binding to EGFR.
 [00297]          In some embodiments, the MM is a polypeptide of about 2 to 40 amino acids
 in length, for example, no more than 40 amino acids long.
 [00298]          In some embodiments, the MM polypeptide sequence is different from that
 of EGFR, and the MM polypeptide sequence is no more than 50% identical to any natural
 binding partner of the AB.
 [00299]          In some embodiments, the CM is positioned in the activatable antibody
 and/or conjugated activatable antibody such that in the uncleaved state, binding of the
 activatable antibody and/or conjugated activatable antibody to EGFR is reduced to occur
 with an equilibrium dissociation constant that is at least 20-fold greater than the equilibrium
 dissociation constant of an unmodified AB binding to EGFR, and whereas the AB of the
 activatable antibody in the cleaved state binds EGFR.

 [003001          In some embodiments, the CM is positioned in the activatable antibody
 and/or conjugated activatable antibody such that in the uncleaved state, binding of the
 activatable antibody and/or conjugated activatable antibody to EGFR is reduced to occur
 with an equilibrium dissociation constant that is at least 100-fold greater than the
 equilibrium dissociation constant of an unmodified AB binding to EGFR, and whereas the
 AB of the activatable antibody in the cleaved state binds EGFR.
 [003011          In some embodiments, the CM is positioned in the activatable antibody
 and/or conjugated activatable antibody such that in the uncleaved state, binding of the
 activatable antibody and/or conjugated activatable antibody to EGFR is reduced to occur
 with an equilibrium dissociation constant that is at least 200-fold greater than the
 equilibrium dissociation constant of an unmodified AB binding to EGFR, and whereas the
 AB of the activatable antibody in the cleaved state binds EGFR.
 [00302]          In some embodiments, the coupling of the MM reduces the ability of the AB
 to bind EGFR such that the dissociation constant (Kd) of the AB when coupled to the MM
 towards EGFR is at least 20 times greater than the Kd of the AB when not coupled to the
 MM towards EGFR. In some embodiments, the coupling of the MM reduces the ability of
 the AB to bind EGFR such that the Kd of the AB when coupled to the MM towards EGFR
 is at least 100 times greater than the Kd of the AB when not coupled to the MM towards
 EGFR. In some embodiments, the coupling of the MM reduces the ability of the AB to
 bind EGFR such that the Kd of the AB when coupled to the MM towards EGFR is at least
 1000 times greater than the Kd of the AB when not coupled to the MM towards EGFR. In
 some embodiments, the coupling of the MM reduces the ability of the AB to bind EGFR
 such that the Kd of the AB when coupled to the MM towards EGFR is at least 10,000 times
 greater than the Kd of the AB when not coupled to the MM towards EGFR.
 [003031          In some embodiments, the CM is a polypeptide of up to 15 amino acids in
 length.
 [00304]          In some embodiments, in the presence of EGFR, the MM reduces the ability
 of the AB to bind EGFR by at least 90% when the CM is uncleaved, as compared to when
 the CM is cleaved when assayed in vitro using a target displacement assay such as, for
 example, the assay described in PCT Publication Nos. WO 2009/025846 and WO
 2010/081173.

                              Detailed Description of the Invention
 [00354]         The present invention provides activatable monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
 that specifically bind human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), also known as EGF
 receptor, human EGF receptor-1 (HER1), erbB, erbB1, and species antigen 7 (SA-7). The
 activatable anti-EGFR antibodies, also referred to herein as anti-EGFR activatable
 antibodies or EGFR activatable antibodies, are used in methods of treating, preventing,
 delaying the progression of, ameliorating and/or alleviating a symptom of a disease or
 disorder associated with aberrant EGFR expression and/or activity. For example, the
 activatable anti-EGFR antibodies are used in methods of treating, preventing, delaying the
 progression of, ameliorating and/or alleviating a symptom of a cancer or other neoplastic
 condition.
 [00355]          The activatable anti-EGFR antibodies include an antibody or antigen-binding
 fragment thereof that specifically binds epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) coupled
 to a masking moiety (MM), such that coupling of the MM reduces the ability of the
 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof to bind EGFR. In a preferred embodiment,
 the MM is coupled via a sequence that includes a substrate for a protease, for example, a
                                                 90

WO 2013/163631                                                                 PCT/US2013/038540
 protease that is co-localized with EGFR at a treatment site in a subject. Numerous studies
 have demonstrated the correlation of aberrant protease levels, e.g., uPA, legumain, MT-SP1,
 matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), in solid tumors. (See e.g., Murthy RV, et al. "Legumain
 expression in relation to clinicopathologic and biological variables in colorectal cancer."
 Clin Cancer Res. 11 (2005): 2293 -2299; Nielsen BS, et al. "Urokinase plasminogen
 activator is localized in stromal cells in ductal breast cancer." Lab Invest 81 (2001): 1485
 1501; Mook OR, et al. "In situ localization of gelatinolytic activity in the extracellular
 matrix of metastases of colon cancer in rat liver using quenched fluorogenic DQ-gelatin." J
 Histochem Cytochem. 51 (2003): 821-829).
 [00356]           The activatable anti-EGFR antibodies provided herein include a substrate for
 a protease, which is useful in leveraging the protease activity in tumor cells for targeted
 antibody activation at the site of treatment and/or diagnosis. A general overview of this
 process is shown in Figure 1A, and a general overview of the process by which a suitable
 substrate for a protease such as uPA, MT-SP 1, Legumain, etc., is selected is shown in
 Figure 1B. The substrate selection process is used to identify substrates that have a number
 of desirable characteristics. For example, the selected substrates are systemically stable
 (i.e., stable in the systemic circulation of a subject), are generally not susceptible to
 cleavage by circulating proteases such as plasmin, thrombin, tissue plasminogen activator
 (tPA) or a kallikrein (KLK) such as KLK-5 and/or
 KLK-7, are non-toxic, are generally not susceptible to cleavage at potential sites of toxicity
 such as the skin by proteases such as ADAM 9, ADAM 10, ADAM 17 and/or kallikreins,
 such as KLK-5 and KLK-7, and are active at an intended site of treatment and/or diagnosis.
 Preferably, the identified substrates are selected for proteases that are overexpressed at an
 intended site of therapy and/or diagnosis but are not typically expressed at or in normal,
 healthy or otherwise non-diseased or damaged tissue, and then the selected substrates are
 subsequently counter-screened against proteases expressed in normal, e.g., non-diseased,
 tissue.
 [00357]           In some embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof in
 the activatable anti-EGFR antibody is derived from the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab.
 Cetuximab, also known as Erbitux or C225, is a chimeric (mouse/human) monoclonal
 antibody that specifically binds EGFR. Cetuximab is currently used in the treatment of
 metastatic colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer.

 [003581         Preferably, the activatable anti-EGFR antibody includes a heavy chain that is
 or is derived from the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26, the amino acid sequence of
 SEQ ID NO: 30, or the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 34.
 [00359]         In some embodiments, the sequence of the antibody or antigen-binding
 fragment thereof that binds EGFR contains at least one amino acid substitution to remove a
 potential site of glycosylation. For example, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment
 thereof that binds EGFR contains an amino acid substitution in the heavy chain and/or the
 light chain to remove a potential site of glycosylation. In some embodiments, the antibody
 or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds EGFR has a heavy chain in which the
 asparagine (N) corresponding to the asparagine at position 88 of the heavy chain having
 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 30 is replaced with a glutamine (Q) residue to yield a
 heavy chain having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26.
 [003601         In some embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that
 binds EGFR in the activatable antibodies can include additional modifications, particularly
 in the Fc region of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. For example, the Fc
 region of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof can include one or more amino
 acid substitutions to remove a potential site of glycosylation and or to disrupt binding of the
 Fc region of its receptor. In some embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment
 thereof that binds EGFR has a heavy chain in which the asparagine (N) corresponding to the
 asparagine at position 299 of the heavy chain having amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:
 30 is replaced with an alanine (A) residue. This mutation removes a glycosylation site in
 the Fc region and leads to reduced Fc receptor binding by the Fc. In some embodiments,
 the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds EGFR has a heavy chain in
 which the asparagine (N) corresponding to the asparagine at position 88 of the heavy chain
 having amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 30 is replaced with a glutamine (Q) residue
 and in which the asparagine (N) corresponding to the asparagine at position 299 of the
 heavy chain having amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 30 is replaced with an alanine (A)
 residue to yield a heavy chain having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 34.
 [003611         In some embodiments, the activatable anti-EGFR antibody includes a signal
 peptide. The signal peptide can be linked to the activatable anti-EGFR antibody by a
 spacer. In some embodiments, the spacer is conjugated to the activatable antibody in the
 absence of a signal peptide. In some embodiments, the spacer is joined directly to the MM
 of the activatable antibody. In some embodiments, the spacer has amino acid sequence
                                                92

WO 2013/163631                                                                PCT/US2013/038540
 QGQSGQ (SEQ ID NO: 38). In some embodiments, an activatable antibody comprises a
 spacer of sequence QGQSGQ (SEQ ID NO: 38) joined directly to a MM sequence
 CISPRGCPDGPYVMY (SEQ ID NO: 14) in the structural arrangement from N-terminus to
 C-terminus of spacer-MM-CM-AB. In some embodiments, an activatable antibody
 includes a spacer joined directly to a MM sequence and includes the amino acid sequence
 QGQSGQCISPRGCPDGPYVMY (SEQ ID NO: 59) in the structural arrangement from N
 terminus to C-terminus of spacer-MM-CM-AB.
 [00362]         The activatable anti-EGFR antibodies provided herein include a masking
 moiety. In some embodiments, the masking moiety is an amino acid sequence that is
 coupled, or otherwise attached, to the anti-EGFR antibody and is positioned within the
 activatable anti-EGFR antibody construct such that the masking moiety reduces the ability
 of the anti-EGFR antibody to specifically bind EGFR. Suitable masking moieties are
 identified using any of a variety of known techniques. For example, peptide masking
 moieties are identified using the methods described in U.S. Patent Application Publication
No. 2009/0062142 by Daugherty et al., the contents of which are hereby incorporated by
 reference in their entirety.
 [003631         The activatable anti-EGFR antibodies provided herein include a cleavable
 moiety. In some embodiments, the cleavable moiety includes an amino acid sequence that
 is a substrate for a protease, usually an extracellular protease. Suitable substrates are
 identified using any of a variety of known techniques. For example, peptide substrates are
 identified using the methods described in U.S. Patent No. 7,666,817 by Daugherty et al., the
 contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. (See also Boulware
 et al. "Evolutionary optimization of peptide substrates for proteases that exhibit rapid
 hydrolysis kinetics." Biotechnol Bioeng. 106.3 (2010): 339-46).
 [00364]         The activatable anti-EGFR antibodies described herein overcome a limitation
 of antibody therapeutics, particularly antibody therapeutics that are known to be toxic to at
 least some degree in vivo. Target-mediated toxicity constitutes a major limitation for the
 development of therapeutic antibodies. This is best exemplified by the skin rash that afflicts
 88% of patients treated with cetuximab, an antibody that specifically binds epidermal
 growth factor receptor (EGFR) and has been approved for the treatment of colorectal and
 head and neck cancer. The activatable anti-EGFR antibodies provided herein are designed
 to address the toxicity associated with the inhibition of the target in normal tissues by
 traditional therapeutic antibodies. These activatable anti-EGFR antibodies remain masked
                                                 93

WO 2013/163631                                                                  PCT/US2013/038540
 until proteolytically activated at the site of disease. Starting with cetuximab as a parental
 therapeutic antibody, the activatable anti-EGFR antibodies of the invention were engineered
 by coupling the antibody to an inhibitory mask through a linker that incorporates a protease
 substrate. In studies performed in vitro studies, the binding to EGFR and the cell-based
 activity of the activatable anti-EGFR antibody was diminished compared to cetuximab. In
 studies performed in vivo studies, the activatable anti-EGFR antibody remained masked in
 normal tissues, but was activated and accumulated in the tumor environment. The tumor
 activation of the activatable anti-EGFR antibody translated into an in vivo efficacy that was
 equivalent to the efficacy of cetuximab.
 [00365]         The activatable anti-EGFR antibodies provided herein satisfy a significant
 clinical need. EGFR is a clinically validated target that has been shown to promote
 proliferation, angiogenesis and invasion/metastasis, as well as to inhibit apoptosis of tumor
 cells. Antibodies and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting EGFR have been
 approved for cancer treatment (Nature Rev Cancer 5 (2005) 341; Curr Opin Cell Biol 21,
 (2009) 177). However, current anti-EGFR therapies, also referred to as EGFR inhibitors
 (EGFRi), have been shown to exhibit a number of adverse events post-treatment, including
 for example, papulopustular rash, particularly in the face and upper trunk of human
 subjects; dry and itchy skin; inflammation around the nails, loss of hair on the scalp; and
 increased growth of eyelashes and facial hair. Cutaneous toxicities that results from
 treatment with EGFRi have been shown to affect        4 5 -100% of patients. (See e.g., Segaert
 and Van Cutsem. Ann Oncol. 16(9) (2005):1425-33).
 [003661         Exemplary activatable anti-EGFR antibodies of the invention include, for
 example, the activatable antibody referred to herein as the 3954-1204-C225v5 activatable
 antibody, which binds epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Two sequences of the
 3954-1204-C225v5 activatable anti-EGFR antibody are shown below, Sequence 1 is the
 sequence of a version of the 3954-1204-C225v5 activatable anti-EGFR antibody that
 includes a signal peptide, and Sequence 2 is the sequence of the 3954-1204-C225v5
 activatable anti-EGFR antibody without the signal peptide:

 [00369]          When an activatable anti-EGFR antibody of the invention is cleaved by a
 protease, i.e., when the activatable anti-EGFR is in an active or cleaved state, the activated
 anti-EGFR antibody will retain only a portion of the amino acid sequence of the activatable
 antibody in an inactive or uncleaved state. The sequence of the activatable anti-EGFR in an
 active or cleaved state will vary depending on which protease cleaves the substrate (CM), as
 different proteases can have different recognition sites.
 [00370]          For example, the exemplary anti-EGFR antibodies of the invention, the
 3954-1204-C225v5 activatable antibody, the 3954-1204-C225v4 activatable antibody,

 [00372]         In some embodiments, the activatable anti-EGFR antibodies described herein
 also include an agent conjugated to the activatable antibody. In some embodiments, the
 conjugated agent is a therapeutic agent, such as an antineoplastic agent. In such
 embodiments, the agent is conjugated to a carbohydrate moiety of the activatable antibody,
 preferably where the carbohydrate moiety is located outside the antigen-binding region of
 the antibody or antigen-binding fragment in the activatable antibody. In some
 embodiments, the agent is conjugated to a sulfhydryl group of the antibody or antigen
 binding fragment in the activatable antibody. In some embodiments, the agent is conjugated
 to an amino group of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the activatable antibody.

 In some embodiments the agent is conjugated to a carboxylic acid group of the antibody or
 antigen-binding fragment of the activatable antibody.
 [00373]          In some embodiments, the agent is a cytotoxic agent such as a toxin (e.g., an
 enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments
 thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate). Suitable cytotoxic agents include,
 for example, any of the cytotoxic agents listed in Table 1. In some embodiments, the
 cytotoxic agent is a dolastatin or a derivative thereof (e.g. auristatin E, AFP, MMAF,
 MMAE, DMAF, DMAE). For example, the cytotoxic agent is monomethyl auristatin E
 (MMAE).
 [00374]          In some embodiments, the conjugated activatable antibody can be modified
 for site-specific conjugation through modified amino acid sequences inserted or otherwise
 included in the activatable antibody sequence. These modified amino acid sequences are
 designed to allow for controlled placement and/or dosage of the conjugated agent within a
 conjugated activatable anti-EGFR antibody. For example, the activatable antibody can be
 engineered to include cysteine substitutions at positions on light and heavy chains that
 provide reactive thiol groups and do not negatively impact protein folding and assembly,
 nor alter antigen binding. In some embodiments, the activatable antibody can be engineered
 to include or otherwise introduce one or more non-natural amino acid residues within the
 activatable antibody to provide suitable sites for conjugation. In some embodiments, the
 activatable antibody can be engineered to include or otherwise introduce enzymatically
 activatable peptide sequences within the activatable antibody sequence.
 [00375]          In some embodiments, the agent is a detectable moiety such as, for example,
 a label or other marker. For example, the agent is or includes a radiolabeled amino acid,
 one or more biotinyl moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g., streptavidin
 containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or
 calorimetric methods), one or more radioisotopes or radionuclides, one or more fluorescent
 labels, one or more enzymatic labels, and/or one or more chemiluminescent agents. In some
 embodiments, detectable moieties are attached by spacer molecules.
 [00376]          Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include
 diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from
 Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin,
 Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, Phytolaca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and
 PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor,

 gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. A variety of
 radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples
 include mBi,       I,  In, "Y, and  16Re.
 [00377]          Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of
 bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate
 (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl
 adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as
 glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis
 diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates
 (such as toluene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro
 2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in
 Vitetta et al., Science 238: 1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3
 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for
 conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. (See W094/11026).
 [00378]          Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a large variety of
 possible moieties can be coupled to the resultant antibodies of the invention. (See, for
 example, "Conjugate Vaccines", Contributions to Microbiology and Immunology, J. M.

 [00380]         Coupling may be accomplished by any chemical reaction that will bind the
 two molecules so long as the antibody and the other moiety retain their respective activities.
 This linkage can include many chemical mechanisms, for instance covalent binding, affinity
 binding, intercalation, coordinate binding and complexation. The preferred binding is,
 however, covalent binding. Covalent binding can be achieved either by direct condensation
 of existing side chains or by the incorporation of external bridging molecules. Many
 bivalent or polyvalent linking agents are useful in coupling protein molecules, such as the
 antibodies of the present invention, to other molecules. For example, representative
 coupling agents can include organic compounds such as thioesters, carbodiimides,
 succinimide esters, diisocyanates, glutaraldehyde, diazobenzenes and hexamethylene

 diamines. This listing is not intended to be exhaustive of the various classes of coupling
 agents known in the art but, rather, is exemplary of the more common coupling agents. (See
 Killen and Lindstrom, Jour. Immun. 133:1335-2549 (1984); Jansen et al., Immunological
 Reviews 62:185-216 (1982); and Vitetta et al., Science 238:1098 (1987).
 [00381]          Preferred linkers are described in the literature. (See,for example,
 Ramakrishnan, S. et al., Cancer Res. 44:201-208 (1984) describing use of MBS (M
 maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester). See also, U.S. Patent No. 5,030,719,
 describing use of halogenated acetyl hydrazide derivative coupled to an antibody by way of
 an oligopeptide linker. Particularly preferred linkers include: (i) SMPT (4
 succinimidyloxycarbonyl-alpha-methyl-alpha-(2-pridyl-dithio)-toluene        (Pierce Chem. Co.,
 Cat. (21558G); (ii) SPDP (succinimidyl-6 [3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionamido]hexanoate
 (Pierce Chem. Co., Cat #21651G); and (iii) Sulfo-LC-SPDP (sulfosuccinimidyl 6 [3-(2
 pyridyldithio)-propianamide] hexanoate (Pierce Chem. Co. Cat. #2165-G.
 [00382]          The linkers described above contain components that have different
 attributes, thus leading to conjugates with differing physio-chemical properties. For
 example, the linker SMPT contains a sterically hindered disulfide bond, and can form
 conjugates with increased stability. Disulfide linkages, are in general, less stable than other
 linkages because the disulfide linkage is cleaved in vitro, resulting in less conjugate
 available.
 [00383]          The reagent EDC (1 -ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
 hydrochloride is useful to create a carboxamide starting with a carboxylic acid and a
 primary or secondary amine. Thus, EDC may be used to link lysine residues in an antibody
 with a carboxylic acid in a linker or toxin, or to link aspartate or glutamate residues in an
 antibody with an amine in a linker or toxin. Such conjugation reactions utilizing EDC may
 be enhanced by addition of NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) or sulfo-NHS (N-hydroxy-3
 oxysulfonylsuccinimide). Addition of NHS or sulfo-NHS to such conjugation reactions
 may enhance the rate, completeness, selectivity, and/or reproducibility of the conjugation
 reactions.
 [00384]          In some embodiments, the linkers are cleavable. In some embodiments, the
 linkers are non-cleavable. In some embodiments, two or more linkers are present. The two
 or more linkers are all the same, e.g., cleavable or non-cleavable, or the two or more linkers
 are different, e.g., at least one cleavable and at least one non-cleavable.

 [003851         The present invention utilizes several methods for attaching agents to ABs:
 (a) attachment to the carbohydrate moieties of the AB, or (b) attachment to sulfhydryl
 groups of the AB, or (c) attachment to amino groups of the AB, or (d) attachment to
 carboxylate groups of the AB. According to the invention, ABs may be covalently attached
 to an agent through an intermediate linker having at least two reactive groups, one to react
 with AB and one to react with the agent. The linker, which may include any compatible
 organic compound, can be chosen such that the reaction with AB (or agent) does not
 adversely affect AB reactivity and selectivity. Furthermore, the attachment of linker to
 agent might not destroy the activity of the agent. Suitable linkers for reaction with oxidized
 antibodies or oxidized antibody fragments include those containing an amine selected from
 the group consisting of primary amine, secondary amine, hydrazine, hydrazide,
 hydroxylamine, phenylhydrazine, semicarbazide and thiosemicarbazide groups. Such
 reactive functional groups may exist as part of the structure of the linker, or may be
 introduced by suitable chemical modification of linkers not containing such groups.
 [00386]         According to the present invention, suitable linkers for attachment to reduced
 ABs include those having certain reactive groups capable of reaction with a sulfhydryl
 group of a reduced antibody or fragment. Such reactive groups include, but are not limited
 to: reactive haloalkyl groups (including, for example, haloacetyl groups), p-mercuribenzoate
 groups and groups capable of Michael-type addition reactions (including, for example,
 maleimides and groups of the type described by Mitra and Lawton, 1979, J. Amer. Chem.
 Soc. 101: 3097-3110).
 [00387]         According to the present invention, suitable linkers for attachment to neither
 oxidized nor reduced Abs include those having certain functional groups capable of reaction
 with the primary amino groups present in unmodified lysine residues in the Ab. Such
 reactive groups include, but are not limited to, NHS carboxylic or carbonic esters, sulfo
NHS carboxylic or carbonic esters, 4-nitrophenyl carboxylic or carbonic esters,
 pentafluorophenyl carboxylic or carbonic esters, acyl imidazoles, isocyanates, and
 isothiocyanates.
 [00388]         According to the present invention, suitable linkers for attachment to neither
 oxidized nor reduced Abs include those having certain functional groups capable of reaction
 with the carboxylic acid groups present in aspartate or glutamate residues in the Ab, which
 have been activated with suitable reagents. Suitable activating reagents include EDC, with
 or without added NHS or sulfo-NHS, and other dehydrating agents utilized for carboxamide

WO 2013/163631                                                                 PCT/US2013/038540
 formation. In these instances, the functional groups present in the suitable linkers would
 include primary and secondary amines, hydrazines, hydroxylamines, and hydrazides.
 [003891         The agent may be attached to the linker before or after the linker is attached
 to the AB. In certain applications it may be desirable to first produce an AB-linker
 intermediate in which the linker is free of an associated agent. Depending upon the
 particular application, a specific agent may then be covalently attached to the linker. In
 other embodiments the AB is first attached to the MM, CM and associated linkers and then
 attached to the linker for conjugation purposes.
 [003901         Branched Linkers: In specific embodiments, branched linkers that have
 multiple sites for attachment of agents are utilized. For multiple site linkers, a single
 covalent attachment to an AB would result in an AB-linker intermediate capable of binding
 an agent at a number of sites. The sites may be aldehyde or sulfhydryl groups or any
 chemical site to which agents can be attached.
 [003911         Alternatively, higher specific activity (or higher ratio of agents to AB) can be
 achieved by attachment of a single site linker at a plurality of sites on the AB. This plurality
 of sites may be introduced into the AB by either of two methods. First, one may generate
 multiple aldehyde groups and/or sulfhydryl groups in the same AB. Second, one may attach
 to an aldehyde or sulfhydryl of the AB a "branched linker" having multiple functional sites
 for subsequent attachment to linkers. The functional sites of the branched linker or multiple
 site linker may be aldehyde or sulfhydryl groups, or may be any chemical site to which
 linkers may be attached. Still higher specific activities may be obtained by combining these
 two approaches, that is, attaching multiple site linkers at several sites on the AB.
 [00392]         Cleavable Linkers: Peptide linkers which are susceptible to cleavage by
 enzymes of the complement system, such as but not limited to urokinase, tissue
 plasminogen activator, trypsin, plasmin, or another enzyme having proteolytic activity may
 be used in one embodiment of the present invention. According to one method of the
 present invention, an agent is attached via a linker susceptible to cleavage by complement.
 The antibody is selected from a class that can activate complement. The antibody-agent
 conjugate, thus, activates the complement cascade and releases the agent at the target site.
 According to another method of the present invention, an agent is attached via a linker
 susceptible to cleavage by enzymes having a proteolytic activity such as a urokinase, a
 tissue plasminogen activator, plasmin, or trypsin. These cleavable linkers are useful in
                                                120

 [00394]         In addition, agents may be attached via disulfide bonds (for example, the
 disulfide bonds on a cysteine molecule) to the AB. Since many tumors naturally release
 high levels of glutathione (a reducing agent) this can reduce the disulfide bonds with
                                               121

WO 2013/163631                                                                PCT/US2013/038540
 subsequent release of the agent at the site of delivery. In certain specific embodiments the
 reducing agent that would modify a CM would also modify the linker of the conjugated
 activatable antibody.
 [00395]          Spacers and CleavableElements: In still another embodiment, it may be
 necessary to construct the linker in such a way as to optimize the spacing between the agent
 and the AB of the activatable antibody. This may be accomplished by use of a linker of the
 general structure:
                                          W - (CH 2)n -  Q
 wherein
 W is either --NH--CH 2-- or -- CH 2 -- ;
 Q is an amino acid, peptide; and
 n is an integer from 0 to 20.
 [003961          In still other embodiments, the linker may comprise a spacer element and a
 cleavable element. The spacer element serves to position the cleavable element away from
 the core of the AB such that the cleavable element is more accessible to the enzyme
 responsible for cleavage. Certain of the branched linkers described above may serve as
 spacer elements.
 [00397]          Throughout this discussion, it should be understood that the attachment of
 linker to agent (or of spacer element to cleavable element, or cleavable element to agent)
 need not be particular mode of attachment or reaction. Any reaction providing a product of
 suitable stability and biological compatibility is acceptable.
 [003981          Serum Complement and Selection ofLinkers: According to one method of
 the present invention, when release of an agent is desired, an AB that is an antibody of a
 class which can activate complement is used. The resulting conjugate retains both the ability
 to bind antigen and activate the complement cascade. Thus, according to this embodiment
 of the present invention, an agent is joined to one end of the cleavable linker or cleavable
 element and the other end of the linker group is attached to a specific site on the AB. For
 example, if the agent has an hydroxy group or an amino group, it may be attached to the
 carboxy terminus of a peptide, amino acid or other suitably chosen linker via an ester or
 amide bond, respectively. For example, such agents may be attached to the linker peptide
 via a carbodimide reaction. If the agent contains functional groups that would interfere with
 attachment to the linker, these interfering functional groups can be blocked before
 attachment and deblocked once the product conjugate or intermediate is made. The opposite
                                                122

WO 2013/163631                                                                PCT/US2013/038540
 or amino terminus of the linker is then used either directly or after further modification for
 binding to an AB which is capable of activating complement.
 [003991          Linkers (or spacer elements of linkers) may be of any desired length, one end
 of which can be covalently attached to specific sites on the AB of the activatable antibody.
 The other end of the linker or spacer element may be attached to an amino acid or peptide
 linker.
 [00400]          Thus when these conjugates bind to antigen in the presence of complement
 the amide or ester bond which attaches the agent to the linker will be cleaved, resulting in
 release of the agent in its active form. These conjugates, when administered to a subject,
 will accomplish delivery and release of the agent at the target site, and are particularly
 effective for the in vivo delivery of pharmaceutical agents, antibiotics, antimetabolites,
 antiproliferative agents and the like as presented in but not limited to those in Table 1.
 [00401]          Linkersfor Release without Complement Activation: In yet another
 application of targeted delivery, release of the agent without complement activation is
 desired since activation of the complement cascade will ultimately lyse the target cell.
 Hence, this approach is useful when delivery and release of the agent should be
 accomplished without killing the target cell. Such is the goal when delivery of cell
 mediators such as hormones, enzymes, corticosteroids, neurotransmitters, genes or enzymes
 to target cells is desired. These conjugates may be prepared by attaching the agent to an AB
 that is not capable of activating complement via a linker that is mildly susceptible to
 cleavage by serum proteases. When this conjugate is administered to an individual, antigen
 antibody complexes will form quickly whereas cleavage of the agent will occur slowly, thus
 resulting in release of the compound at the target site.
 [00402]          Biochemical Cross Linkers: In other embodiments, the activatable antibody
 may be conjugated to one or more therapeutic agents using certain biochemical cross
 linkers. Cross-linking reagents form molecular bridges that tie together functional groups of
 two different molecules. To link two different proteins in a step-wise manner, hetero
 bifunctional cross-linkers can be used that eliminate unwanted homopolymer formation.
 [00403]          Peptidyl linkers cleavable by lysosomal proteases are also useful, for
 example, Val-Cit, Val-Ala or other dipeptides. In addition, acid-labile linkers cleavable in
 the low-pH environment of the lysosome may be used, for example: bis-sialyl ether. Other
 suitable linkers include cathepsin-labile substrates, particularly those that show optimal
 function at an acidic pH.

 [00410]         As used herein, the term "antibody" refers to immunoglobulin molecules and
 immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules, i.e., molecules that
 contain an antigen binding site that specifically binds (immunoreacts with) an antigen. By
 "specifically bind" or "immunoreacts with" or "immunospecifically bind" is meant that the
 antibody reacts with one or more antigenic determinants of the desired antigen and does not
 react with other polypeptides or binds at much lower affinity (Kd > 10-6). Antibodies
 include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, chimeric, domain antibody, single
 chain, Fab, and F(ab') 2 fragments, scFvs, and an Fab expression library.
 [00411]         The basic antibody structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each
 tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one
 "light" (about 25 kDa) and one "heavy" chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal
 portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids
 primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain
 defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. In general, antibody
 molecules obtained from humans relate to any of the classes IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE and IgD,
 which differ from one another by the nature of the heavy chain present in the molecule.
 Certain classes have subclasses as well, such as IgG 1 , IgG 2, and others. Furthermore, in
 humans, the light chain may be a kappa chain or a lambda chain.
 [00412]         The term "monoclonal antibody" (mAb) or "monoclonal antibody
 composition", as used herein, refers to a population of antibody molecules that contain only
 one molecular species of antibody molecule consisting of a unique light chain gene product
 and a unique heavy chain gene product. In particular, the complementarity determining
 regions (CDRs) of the monoclonal antibody are identical in all the molecules of the
 population. MAbs contain an antigen binding site capable of immunoreacting with a
 particular epitope of the antigen characterized by a unique binding affinity for it.

WO 2013/163631                                                               PCT/US2013/038540
 [00413]         The term "antigen-binding site" or "binding portion" refers to the part of the
 immunoglobulin molecule that participates in antigen binding. The antigen binding site is
 formed by amino acid residues of the N-terminal variable ("V") regions of the heavy ("H")
 and light ("L") chains. Three highly divergent stretches within the V regions of the heavy
 and light chains, referred to as "hypervariable regions," are interposed between more
 conserved flanking stretches known as "framework regions," or "FRs". Thus, the term
 "FR" refers to amino acid sequences which are naturally found between, and adjacent to,
 hypervariable regions in immunoglobulins. In an antibody molecule, the three
 hypervariable regions of a light chain and the three hypervariable regions of a heavy chain
 are disposed relative to each other in three dimensional space to form an antigen-binding
 surface. The antigen-binding surface is complementary to the three-dimensional surface of
 a bound antigen, and the three hypervariable regions of each of the heavy and light chains
 are referred to as "complementarity-determining regions," or "CDRs." The assignment of
 amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat Sequences of
 Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987 and
 1991)), or Chothia & Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987), Chothia et al. Nature 342:878
 883 (1989).
 [00414]         As used herein, the term "epitope" includes any protein determinant capable
 of specific binding to an immunoglobulin, an scFv, or a T-cell receptor. The term "epitope"
 includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T
 cell receptor. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings
 of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three
 dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. For
 example, antibodies may be raised against N-terminal or C-terminal peptides of a
 polypeptide. An antibody is said to specifically bind an antigen when the dissociation
 constant is < 1 pM; preferably < 100 nM and most preferably < 10 nM.
 [00415]         As used herein, the terms "specific binding," "immunological binding," and
 "immunological binding properties" refer to the non-covalent interactions of the type which
 occur between an immunoglobulin molecule and an antigen for which the immunoglobulin
 is specific. The strength, or affinity of immunological binding interactions can be expressed
 in terms of the dissociation constant (Kd) of the interaction, wherein a smaller Kd represents
 a greater affinity. Immunological binding properties of selected polypeptides can be
                                                127

WO 2013/163631                                                                PCT/US2013/038540
 quantified using methods well known in the art. One such method entails measuring the
 rates of antigen-binding site/antigen complex formation and dissociation, wherein those
 rates depend on the concentrations of the complex partners, the affinity of the interaction,
 and geometric parameters that equally influence the rate in both directions. Thus, both the
 "on rate constant" (K.n) and the "off rate constant" (Koff) can be determined by calculation
 of the concentrations and the actual rates of association and dissociation. (See Nature
 361:186-87 (1993)). The ratio of Kff /Kon enables the cancellation of all parameters not
 related to affinity, and is equal to the dissociation constant Kd. (See, generally, Davies et al.
 (1990) Annual Rev Biochem 59:439-473). An antibody of the present invention is said to
 specifically bind to EGFR, when the equilibrium binding constant (Kd) is I pM, preferably
 <  100 nM, more preferably       10 nM, and most preferably     100 pM to about 1 pM, as
 measured by assays such as radioligand binding assays or similar assays known to those
 skilled in the art.
 [004161          The term "isolated polynucleotide" as used herein shall mean a
 polynucleotide of genomic, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof, which
 by virtue of its origin the "isolated polynucleotide" (1) is not associated with all or a portion
 of a polynucleotide in which the "isolated polynucleotide" is found in nature, (2) is operably
 linked to a polynucleotide which it is not linked to in nature, or (3) does not occur in nature
 as part of a larger sequence. Polynucleotides in accordance with the invention include the
 nucleic acid molecules encoding the heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules shown herein,
 and nucleic acid molecules encoding the light chain immunoglobulin molecules shown
 herein.
 [00417]          The term "isolated protein" referred to herein means a protein of cDNA,
 recombinant RNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof, which by virtue of its
 origin, or source of derivation, the "isolated protein" (1) is not associated with proteins
 found in nature, (2) is free of other proteins from the same source, e.g., free of murine
 proteins, (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, or (4) does not occur in nature.
 [00418]          The term "polypeptide" is used herein as a generic term to refer to native
 protein, fragments, or analogs of a polypeptide sequence. Hence, native protein fragments,
 and analogs are species of the polypeptide genus. Polypeptides in accordance with the
 invention comprise the heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules shown herein, and the light
 chain immunoglobulin molecules shown herein, as well as antibody molecules formed by
                                                  128

WO 2013/163631                                                               PCT/US2013/038540
 combinations comprising the heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules with light chain
 immunoglobulin molecules, such as kappa light chain immunoglobulin molecules, and vice
 versa, as well as fragments and analogs thereof.
 [00419]          The term "naturally-occurring" as used herein as applied to an object refers
 to the fact that an object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or
 polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be
 isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in
 the laboratory or otherwise is naturally-occurring.
 [00420]          The term "operably linked" as used herein refers to positions of components
 so described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. A
 control sequence "operably linked" to a coding sequence is ligated in such a way that
 expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control
 sequences.
 [00421]          The term "control sequence" as used herein refers to polynucleotide
 sequences which are necessary to effect the expression and processing of coding sequences
 to which they are ligated. The nature of such control sequences differs depending upon the
 host organism in prokaryotes, such control sequences generally include promoter, ribosomal
 binding site, and transcription termination sequence in eukaryotes, generally, such control
 sequences include promoters and transcription termination sequence. The term "control
 sequences" is intended to include, at a minimum, all components whose presence is
 essential for expression and processing, and can also include additional components whose
 presence is advantageous, for example, leader sequences and fusion partner sequences. The
 term "polynucleotide" as referred to herein means nucleotides of at least 10 bases in length,
 either ribonucleotides or deoxynucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide.
 The term includes single and double stranded forms of DNA.
 [00422]          The term oligonucleotide referred to herein includes naturally occurring, and
 modified nucleotides linked together by naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring
 oligonucleotide linkages. Oligonucleotides are a polynucleotide subset generally
 comprising a length of 200 bases or fewer. Preferably oligonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in
 length and most preferably 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 to 40 bases in length.
 Oligonucleotides are usually single stranded, e.g., for probes, although oligonucleotides
 may be double stranded, e.g., for use in the construction of a gene mutant. Oligonucleotides
 of the invention are either sense or antisense oligonucleotides.

 [00423]         The term "naturally occurring nucleotides" referred to herein includes
 deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. The term "modified nucleotides" referred to
 herein includes nucleotides with modified or substituted sugar groups and the like. The
 term "oligonucleotide linkages" referred to herein includes oligonucleotide linkages such as
 phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselerloate, phosphorodiselenoate,
 phosphoroanilothioate, phoshoraniladate, phosphoronmidate, and the like. See e.g.,

No. 5,151,510; Uhlmann and Peyman Chemical Reviews 90:543 (1990). An
 oligonucleotide can include a label for detection, if desired.
 [00424]         As used herein, the twenty conventional amino acids and their abbreviations
 follow conventional usage. See Immunology - A Synthesis (2nd Edition, E.S. Golub and
 D.R. Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland7 Mass. (1991)). Stereoisomers (e.g., D
 amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as a-, a
 disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino
 acids may also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present invention. Examples
 of unconventional amino acids include: 4 hydroxyproline, y-carboxyglutamate, c-N,N,N
 trimethyllysine, c -N-acetyllysine, 0-phosphoserine, N- acetylserine, N-formylmethionine,
 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, a-N-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and
 imino acids (e.g., 4- hydroxyproline). In the polypeptide notation used herein, the left-hand
 direction is the amino terminal direction and the right-hand direction is the carboxy-terminal
 direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention.
 [00425]         Similarly, unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of single- stranded
 polynucleotide sequences is the 5' end the left-hand direction of double-stranded
 polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5' direction. The direction of 5' to 3' addition
 of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction sequence regions on
 the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5' to the 5' end of the
 RNA transcript are referred to as "upstream sequences", sequence regions on the DNA
 strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3' to the 3' end of the RNA
 transcript are referred to as "downstream sequences".

WO 2013/163631                                                                PCT/US2013/038540
 [00426]         As applied to polypeptides, the term "substantial identity" means that two
 peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT
 using default gap weights, share at least 80 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90
 percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 95 percent sequence identity, and most
 preferably at least 99 percent sequence identity.
 [00427]         Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative
 amino acid substitutions.
 [00428]         As discussed herein, minor variations in the amino acid sequences of
 antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules are contemplated as being encompassed by the
 present invention, providing that the variations in the amino acid sequence maintain at least
 75%, more preferably at least 80%, 90%, 95%, and most preferably 99%. In particular,
 conservative amino acid replacements are contemplated. Conservative replacements are
 those that take place within a family of amino acids that are related in their side chains.
 Genetically encoded amino acids are generally divided into families: (1) acidic amino acids
 are aspartate, glutamate; (2) basic amino acids are lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar
 amino acids are alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine,
 tryptophan, and (4) uncharged polar amino acids are glycine, asparagine, glutamine,
 cysteine, serine, threonine, tyrosine. The hydrophilic amino acids include arginine,
 asparagine, aspartate, glutamine, glutamate, histidine, lysine, serine, and threonine. The
 hydrophobic amino acids include alanine, cysteine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine,
 phenylalanine, proline, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine. Other families of amino acids
 include (i) serine and threonine, which are the aliphatic-hydroxy family; (ii) asparagine and
 glutamine, which are the amide containing family; (iii) alanine, valine, leucine and
 isoleucine, which are the aliphatic family; and (iv) phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine,
 which are the aromatic family. For example, it is reasonable to expect that an isolated
 replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, a
 threonine with a serine, or a similar replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related
 amino acid will not have a major effect on the binding or properties of the resulting
 molecule, especially if the replacement does not involve an amino acid within a framework
 site. Whether an amino acid change results in a functional peptide can readily be
 determined by assaying the specific activity of the polypeptide derivative. Assays are
 described in detail herein. Fragments or analogs of antibodies or immunoglobulin
 molecules can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art. Preferred amino- and
                                                131

WO 2013/163631                                                                 PCT/US2013/038540
 carboxy-termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional domains.
 Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the nucleotide and/or
 amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence databases. Preferably,
 computerized comparison methods are used to identify sequence motifs or predicted protein
 conformation domains that occur in other proteins of known structure and/or function.
 Methods to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure
 are known. Bowie et al. Science 253:164 (1991). Thus, the foregoing examples
 demonstrate that those of skill in the art can recognize sequence motifs and structural
 conformations that may be used to define structural and functional domains in accordance
 with the invention.
 [00429]         Preferred amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility
 to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming
 protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and (4) confer or modify other
 physicochemical or functional properties of such analogs. Analogs can include various
 muteins of a sequence other than the naturally-occurring peptide sequence. For example,
 single or multiple amino acid substitutions (preferably conservative amino acid
 substitutions) may be made in the naturally- occurring sequence (preferably in the portion of
 the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts. A conservative
 amino acid substitution should not substantially change the structural characteristics of the
 parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs
 in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the
 parent sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures
 are described in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W. H.
 Freeman and Company, New York (1984)); Introduction to Protein Structure (C. Branden
 and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton et at.
Nature 354:105 (1991).
 [00430]         The term "polypeptide fragment" as used herein refers to a polypeptide that
 has an amino terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion and/or one or more internal
 deletion(s), but where the remaining amino acid sequence is identical to the corresponding
 positions in the naturally-occurring sequence deduced, for example, from a full length
 cDNA sequence. Fragments typically are at least 5, 6, 8 or 10 amino acids long, preferably
 at least 14 amino acids long' more preferably at least 20 amino acids long, usually at least
 50 amino acids long, and even more preferably at least 70 amino acids long. The term
                                                 132

WO 2013/163631                                                                 PCT/US2013/038540
 "analog" as used herein refers to polypeptides which are comprised of a segment of at least
 25 amino acids that has substantial identity to a portion of a deduced amino acid sequence
 and which has specific binding to EGFR, under suitable binding conditions. Typically,
 polypeptide analogs comprise a conservative amino acid substitution (or addition or
 deletion) with respect to the naturally- occurring sequence. Analogs typically are at least 20
 amino acids long, preferably at least 50 amino acids long or longer, and can often be as long
 as a full-length naturally-occurring polypeptide.
 [00431]         The term "agent" is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a mixture of
 chemical compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from biological
 materials.
 [00432]         As used herein, the terms "label" or "labeled" refers to incorporation of a
 detectable marker, e.g., by incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to a
 polypeptide of biotinyl moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g., streptavidin
 containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or
 calorimetric methods). In certain situations, the label or marker can also be therapeutic.
 Various methods of labeling polypeptides and glycoproteins are known in the art and may
 be used. Examples of labels for polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the following:
 radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g., 3H, 14
                                              C, 15
                                                   N, 35s, 90 Y, 99 Tc, In 1251, 1311), fluorescent
 labels (e.g., FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish
 peroxidase, p-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase), chemiluminescent, biotinyl
 groups, predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g.,
 leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding
 domains, epitope tags). In some embodiments, labels are attached by spacer arms of various
 lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance. The term "pharmaceutical agent or drug" as
 used herein refers to a chemical compound or composition capable of inducing a desired
 therapeutic effect when properly administered to a patient.
 [00433]         Other chemistry terms herein are used according to conventional usage in the
 art, as exemplified by The McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (Parker, S., Ed.,
 McGraw-Hill, San Francisco (1985)).
 [00434]         As used herein, "substantially pure" means an object species is the
 predominant species present (i.e., on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other
 individual species in the composition), and preferably a substantially purified fraction is a
                                                 133

WO 2013/163631                                                                  PCT/US2013/038540
 composition wherein the object species comprises at least about 50 percent (on a molar
 basis) of all macromolecular species present.
 [00435]         Generally, a substantially pure composition will comprise more than about
 80 percent of all macromolecular species present in the composition, more preferably more
 than about 85%, 90%, 95%, and 99%. Most preferably, the object species is purified to
 essential homogeneity (contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by
 conventional detection methods) wherein the composition consists essentially of a single
 macromolecular species.
 [00436]         The term patient includes human and veterinary subjects.
         Antibodies
 [00437]         Activatable antibodies of the invention specifically bind human epidermal
 growth factor receptor (EGFR). Also included in the invention are activatable antibodies
 that bind to the same epitope as the activatable anti-EGFR antibodies described herein.
 [00438]         Those skilled in the art will recognize that it is possible to determine, without
 undue experimentation, if a monoclonal antibody (e.g., a murine monoclonal or humanized
 antibody) has the same specificity as a monoclonal antibody used in the methods described
 herein by ascertaining whether the former prevents the latter from binding to EGFR. If the
 monoclonal antibody being tested competes with the monoclonal antibody of the invention,
 as shown by a decrease in binding by the monoclonal antibody of the invention, then the
 two monoclonal antibodies bind to the same, or a closely related, epitope. An alternative
 method for determining whether a monoclonal antibody has the specificity of a monoclonal
 antibody of the invention is to pre-incubate the monoclonal antibody of the invention with
 EGFR and then add the monoclonal antibody being tested to determine if the monoclonal
 antibody being tested is inhibited in its ability to bind EGFR. If the monoclonal antibody
 being tested is inhibited then, in all likelihood, it has the same, or functionally equivalent,
 epitopic specificity as the monoclonal antibody of the invention.

 with the invention will be administered with suitable carriers, excipients, and other agents
 that are incorporated into formulations to provide improved transfer, delivery, tolerance,
 and the like. A multitude of appropriate formulations can be found in the formulary known

 EGFR antibody, are used to prevent, treat or otherwise ameliorate a disease or disorder
 associated with aberrant EGFR expression and/or activity. For example, therapeutic
 formulations of the invention, which include an activatable anti-EGFR antibody, are used to
 treat or otherwise ameliorate a cancer or other neoplastic condition.
 [00441]         Increased proteolysis is known to be a hallmark of cancer. (See e.g., Affara
NI, et al. "Delineating protease functions during cancer development." Methods Mol Biol.
 539 (2009): 1-32). Progression, invasion and metastasis of tumors result from several
 interdependent processes in which proteases are implicated. This process is shown
 generally in Figures 8A and 8B.

 association with any known method for diagnosing or treating the disease or disorder

 aberrant EGFR expression and/or activity in a subject indicates that the activatable antibody
 confers a clinical benefit.
 [004431         Activatable anti-EGFR antibodies can be administered in the form of
 pharmaceutical compositions. Principles and considerations involved in preparing such
 compositions, as well as guidance in the choice of components are provided, for example, in
 Remington : The Science And Practice Of Pharmacy 19th ed. (Alfonso R. Gennaro, et al.,
 editors) Mack Pub. Co., Easton, Pa.: 1995; Drug Absorption Enhancement : Concepts,
 Possibilities, Limitations, And Trends, Harwood Academic Publishers, Langhorne, Pa.,
 1994; and Peptide And Protein Drug Delivery (Advances In Parenteral Sciences, Vol. 4),
 1991, M. Dekker, New York.
 [00444]          Where activatable antibody fragments are used, the smallest fragment that
 specifically binds to the binding domain of the target protein is preferred. For example,
 based upon the variable-region sequences of an antibody, peptide molecules can be
 designed that retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such peptides can be
 synthesized chemically and/or produced by recombinant DNA technology. (See, e.g.,
 Marasco et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 7889-7893 (1993)). The formulation can
 also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being
 treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each
 other. Alternatively, or in addition, the composition can comprise an agent that enhances its
 function, such as, for example, a cytotoxic agent, cytokine, chemotherapeutic agent, or
 growth-inhibitory agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts
 that are effective for the purpose intended.
 [00445]          The active ingredients can also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for
 example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example,
 hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacrylate)
 microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes,
 albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles, and nanocapsules) or in
 macroemulsions.
 [00446]          The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This
 is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.
 [00447]          Sustained-release preparations can be prepared. Suitable examples of
 sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic
 polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g.,
                                                 136

WO 2013/163631                                                                 PCT/US2013/038540
 films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters,
 hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)),
 polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and y ethyl-L
 glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid
 copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT           TM  (injectable microspheres composed of lactic
 acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.
 While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release
 of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods.
 [00448]         In some embodiments, the activatable antibody contains a detectable label.
 An intact antibody, or a fragment thereof (e.g., Fab, scFv, or F(ab) 2 ) is used. The term
 "labeled", with regard to the probe or antibody, is intended to encompass direct labeling of
 the probe or antibody by coupling (i.e., physically linking) a detectable substance to the
 probe or antibody, as well as indirect labeling of the probe or antibody by reactivity with
 another reagent that is directly labeled. Examples of indirect labeling include detection of a
 primary antibody using a fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody and end-labeling of a
 DNA probe with biotin such that it can be detected with fluorescently-labeled streptavidin.
 The term "biological sample" is intended to include tissues, cells and biological fluids
 isolated from a subject, as well as tissues, cells and fluids present within a subject. Included
 within the usage of the term "biological sample", therefore, is blood and a fraction or
 component of blood including blood serum, blood plasma, or lymph. That is, the detection
 method of the invention can be used to detect an analyte mRNA, protein, or genomic DNA
 in a biological sample in vitro as well as in vivo. For example, in vitro techniques for
 detection of an analyte mRNA include Northern hybridizations and in situ hybridizations.
In vitro techniques for detection of an analyte protein include enzyme linked
 immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), Western blots, immunoprecipitations, immunochemical
 staining, and immunofluorescence. In vitro techniques for detection of an analyte genomic
 DNA include Southern hybridizations. Procedures for conducting immunoassays are
 described, for example in "ELISA: Theory and Practice: Methods in Molecular Biology",
 Vol. 42, J. R. Crowther (Ed.) Human Press, Totowa, NJ, 1995; "Immunoassay", E.
 Diamandis and T. Christopoulus, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA, 1996; and "Practice
 and Theory of Enzyme Immunoassays", P. Tijssen, Elsevier Science Publishers,
 Amsterdam, 1985. Furthermore, in vivo techniques for detection of an analyte protein
 include introducing into a subject a labeled anti-analyte protein antibody. For example, the
                                                 137

WO 2013/163631                                                               PCT/US2013/038540
 antibody can be labeled with a radioactive marker whose presence and location in a subject
 can be detected by standard imaging techniques.
           Diagnostic and Prophylactic Formulations
 [00449]          The anti-EGFR antibodies and/or activatable anti-EGFR antibodies of the
 invention are used in diagnostic and prophylactic formulations. In one embodiment, an
 anti-EGFR antibody and/or activatable anti-EGFR antibody is administered to patients that
 are at risk of developing one or more of the aforementioned cancer or other disorders. A
 patient's or organ's predisposition to one or more of the aforementioned disorders can be
 determined using genotypic, serological or biochemical markers.
 [00450]          In another embodiment of the invention, an anti-EGFR antibody and/or
 activatable anti-EGFR antibody is administered to human individuals diagnosed with a
 clinical indication associated with one or more of the aforementioned disorders. Upon
 diagnosis, an anti-EGFR antibody and/or activatable anti-EGFR antibody is administered to
 mitigate or reverse the effects of the clinical indication.
 [00451]          Antibodies and/or activatable antibodies of the invention are also useful in
 the detection of EGFR in patient samples and accordingly are useful as diagnostics. For
 example, the anti-EGFR antibodies and/or activatable anti-EGFR antibodies of the
 invention are used in in vitro assays, e.g., ELISA, to detect EGFR levels in a patient sample.
 [00452]          In one embodiment, an anti-EGFR antibody and/or activatable anti-EGFR
 antibody of the invention is immobilized on a solid support (e.g., the well(s) of a microtiter
 plate). The immobilized antibody and/or activatable antibody serves as a capture antibody
 for any EGFR that may be present in a test sample. Prior to contacting the immobilized
 antibody with a patient sample, the solid support is rinsed and treated with a blocking agent
 such as milk protein or albumin to prevent nonspecific adsorption of the analyte.
 [00453]          Subsequently the wells are treated with a test sample suspected of containing
 the antigen, or with a solution containing a standard amount of the antigen. Such a sample
 is, e.g., a serum sample from a subject suspected of having levels of circulating antigen
 considered to be diagnostic of a pathology. After rinsing away the test sample or standard,
 the solid support is treated with a second antibody that is detectably labeled. The labeled
 second antibody serves as a detecting antibody. The level of detectable label is measured,
 and the concentration of EGFR antigen in the test sample is determined by comparison with
 a standard curve developed from the standard samples.
                                                 138

WO 2013/163631                                                                   PCT/US2013/038540
 [00454]         It will be appreciated that based on the results obtained using the anti-EGFR
 antibodies of the invention in an in vitro diagnostic assay, it is possible to stage a disease in
 a subject based on expression levels of the EGFR antigen. For a given disease, samples of
 blood are taken from subjects diagnosed as being at various stages in the progression of the
 disease, and/or at various points in the therapeutic treatment of the disease. Using a
 population of samples that provides statistically significant results for each stage of
 progression or therapy, a range of concentrations of the antigen that may be considered
 characteristic of each stage is designated.
 [00455]         Anti-EGFR antibodies and/or activatable anti-EGFR antibodies can also be
 used in diagnostic and/or imaging methods. In some embodiments, such methods are in
 vitro methods. In some embodiments, such methods are in vivo methods. In some
 embodiments, such methods are in situ methods. In some embodiments, such methods are
 ex vivo methods. For example, activatable anti-EGFR antibodies having an enzymatically
 cleavable CM can be used to detect the presence or absence of an enzyme that is capable of
 cleaving the CM. Such activatable anti-EGFR antibodies can be used in diagnostics, which
 can include in vivo detection (e.g., qualitative or quantitative) of enzyme activity (or, in
 some embodiments, an environment of increased reduction potential such as that which can
 provide for reduction of a disulfide bond) through measured accumulation of activated anti
 EGFR antibodies (i.e., antibodies resulting from cleavage of an activatable anti-EGFR
 antibody) in a given cell or tissue of a given host organism. Such accumulation of activated
 anti-EGFR antibodies indicates not only that the tissue expresses enzymatic activity (or an
 increased reduction potential depending on the nature of the CM) but also that the tissue
 expresses target to which the activated antibody binds.
 [004561         For example, the CM can be selected to be a protease substrate for a protease
 found at the site of a tumor, at the site of a viral or bacterial infection at a biologically
 confined site (e.g., such as in an abscess, in an organ, and the like), and the like. The AB
 can be one that binds a target antigen. Using methods familiar to one skilled in the art, a
 detectable label (e.g., a fluorescent label or radioactive label or radiotracer) can be
 conjugated to an AB or other region of an anti-EGFR antibody and/or activatable anti
 EGFR antibody. Suitable detectable labels are discussed in the context of the above
 screening methods and additional specific examples are provided below. Using an AB
 specific to a protein or peptide of the disease state, along with a protease whose activity is
 elevated in the disease tissue of interest, activatable anti-EGFR antibodies will exhibit an
                                                  139

WO 2013/163631                                                                  PCT/US2013/038540
 increased rate of binding to disease tissue relative to tissues where the CM specific enzyme
 is not present at a detectable level or is present at a lower level than in disease tissue or is
 inactive (e.g., in zymogen form or in complex with an inhibitor). Since small proteins and
 peptides are rapidly cleared from the blood by the renal filtration system, and because the
 enzyme specific for the CM is not present at a detectable level (or is present at lower levels
 in non-disease tissues or is present in inactive conformation), accumulation of activated
 anti-EGFR antibodies in the disease tissue is enhanced relative to non-disease tissues.
 [00457]          In another example, activatable anti-EGFR antibodies can be used to detect
 the presence or absence of a cleaving agent in a sample. For example, where the activatable
 anti-EGFR antibodies contain a CM susceptible to cleavage by an enzyme, the activatable
 anti-EGFR antibodies can be used to detect (either qualitatively or quantitatively) the
 presence of an enzyme in the sample. In another example, where the activatable anti-EGFR
 antibodies contain a CM susceptible to cleavage by reducing agent, the activatable anti
 EGFR antibodies can be used to detect (either qualitatively or quantitatively) the presence
 of reducing conditions in a sample. To facilitate analysis in these methods, the activatable
 antibodies can be detectably labeled, and can be bound to a support (e.g., a solid support,
 such as a slide or bead). The detectable label can be positioned on a portion of the
 activatable anti-EGFR antibody that is not released following cleavage, for example, the
 detectable label can be a quenched fluorescent label or other label that is not detectable until
 cleavage has occurred. The assay can be conducted by, for example, contacting the
 immobilized, detectably labeled activatable anti-EGFR antibodies with a sample suspected
 of containing an enzyme and/or reducing agent for a time sufficient for cleavage to occur,
 then washing to remove excess sample and contaminants. The presence or absence of the
 cleaving agent (e.g., enzyme or reducing agent) in the sample is then assessed by a change
 in detectable signal of the activatable anti-EGFR antibodies prior to contacting with the
 sample e.g., the presence of and/or an increase in detectable signal due to cleavage of the
 activatable antibody by the cleaving agent in the sample.
 [00458]          Such detection methods can be adapted to also provide for detection of the
 presence or absence of a target that is capable of binding the AB of the activatable anti
 EGFR antibodies when cleaved. Thus, the assays can be adapted to assess the presence or
 absence of a cleaving agent and the presence or absence of a target of interest (EGFR). The
 presence or absence of the cleaving agent can be detected by the presence of and/or an
 increase in detectable label of the activatable anti-EGFR antibodies as described above, and
                                                 140

WO 2013/163631                                                                PCT/US2013/038540
 the presence or absence of the target can be detected by detection of a target-AB complex
 e.g., by use of a detectably labeled anti-target antibody.
 [00459]          Activatable anti-EGFR antibodies are also useful in in situ imaging for the
 validation of activatable antibody activation, e.g., by protease cleavage, and binding to a
 particular target. In situ imaging is a technique that enables localization of proteolytic
 activity and target in biological samples such as cell cultures or tissue sections. Using this
 technique, it is possible to confirm both binding to a given target and proteolytic activity
 based on the presence of a detectable label (e.g., a fluorescent label).
 [00460]          These techniques are useful with any frozen cells or tissue derived from a
 disease site (e.g. tumor tissue) or healthy tissues. These techniques are also useful with
 fresh cell or tissue samples.
 [00461]          In these techniques, an activatable anti-EGFR antibody is labeled with a
 detectable label. The detectable label may be a fluorescent dye, (e.g. Fluorescein
 Isothiocyanate (FITC), Rhodamine Isothiocyanate (TRITC), a near infrared (NIR) dye (e.g.,
 Qdot@ nanocrystals), a colloidal metal, a hapten, a radioactive marker, biotin and an
 amplification reagent such as streptavidin, or an enzyme (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or
 alkaline phosphatase).
 [00462]          Detection of the label in a sample that has been incubated with the labeled,
 activatable anti-EGFR antibody indicates that the sample contains the target, i.e., EGFR,
 and contains a protease that is specific for the CM of the activatable anti-EGFR antibody.
 In some embodiments, the presence of the protease can be confirmed using broad spectrum
 protease inhibitors such as those described herein, and/or by using an agent that is specific
 for the protease, for example, an antibody such as All, which is specific for the protease
 matriptase (MT-SP1) and inhibits the proteolytic activity of MT-SPl; see e.g., International
 Publication Number WO 2010/129609, published 11 November 2010. The same approach
 of using broad spectrum protease inhibitors such as those described herein, and/or by using
 a more selective inhibitory agent can be used to identify a protease or class of proteases
 specific for the CM of the activatable anti-EGFR antibody. In some embodiments, the
 presence of the target can be confirmed using an agent that is specific for the target, e.g.,
 another anti-EGFR antibody, or the detectable label can be competed with unlabeled EGFR.
 In some embodiments, unlabeled activatable anti-EGFR antibody could be used, with
 detection by a labeled secondary antibody or more complex detection system.

WO 2013/163631                                                                  PCT/US2013/038540
 [004631          Similar techniques are also useful for in vivo imaging where detection of the
 fluorescent signal in a subject, e.g., a mammal, including a human, indicates that the disease
 site contains the target, i.e., EGFR, and contains a protease that is specific for the CM of the
 activatable anti-EGFR antibody.
 [00464]          These techniques are also useful in kits and/or as reagents for the detection,
 identification or characterization of protease activity in a variety of cells, tissues, and
 organisms based on the protease-specific CM in the activatable anti-EGFR antibody.
 [00465]          In some embodiments, in situ imaging and/or in vivo imaging are useful in
 methods to identify which patients to treat. For example, in in situ imaging, the activatable
 anti-EGFR antibodies are used to screen patient samples to identify those patients having
 the appropriate protease(s) and target(s) at the appropriate location, e.g., at a tumor site.
 [00466]          In some embodiments in situ imaging is used to identify or otherwise refine a
 patient population suitable for treatment with an anti-EGFR activatable antibody of the
 disclosure. For example, patients that test positive for both the target (e.g., EGFR) and a
 protease that cleaves the substrate in the cleavable moiety (CM) of the anti-EGFR
 activatable antibody being tested (e.g., accumulate activated antibodies at the disease site)
 are identified as suitable candidates for treatment with such an anti-EGFR activatable
 antibody comprising such a CM. Likewise, patients that test negative for either or both of
 the target (e.g., EGFR) and the protease that cleaves the substrate in the CM in the
 activatable antibody being tested using these methods are identified as suitable candidates
 for another form of therapy (i.e., not suitable for treatment with the anti-EGFR activatable
 antibody being tested). In some embodiments, such patients that test negative with respect
 to a first anti-EGFR activatable antibody can be tested with other anti-EGFR activatable
 antibodies comprising different CMs until a suitable anti-EGFR activatable antibody for
 treatment is identified (e.g., an anti-EGFR activatable antibody comprising a CM that is
 cleaved by the patient at the site of disease).
 [00467]          In some embodiments in vivo imaging is used to identify or otherwise refine
 a patient population suitable for treatment with an anti-EGFR activatable antibody of the
 disclosure. For example, patients that test positive for both the target (e.g., EGFR) and a
 protease that cleaves the substrate in the cleavable moiety (CM) of the anti-EGFR
 activatable antibody being tested (e.g., accumulate activated antibodies at the disease site)
 are identified as suitable candidates for treatment with such an anti-EGFR activatable
 antibody comprising such a CM. Likewise, patients that test negative are identified as

 suitable candidates for another form of therapy (i.e., not suitable for treatment with the anti
 EGFR activatable antibody being tested). In some embodiments, such patients that test
 negative with respect to a first anti-EGFR activatable antibody can be tested with other anti
 EGFR activatable antibodies comprising different CMs until a suitable anti-EGFR

 comprising a CM that is cleaved by the patient at the site of disease).
         Pharmaceutical compositions
 [004681         The activatable anti-EGFR antibodies of the invention (also referred to
 herein as "active compounds"), and derivatives, fragments, analogs and homologs thereof,
 can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such
 compositions typically comprise the activatable antibody and a pharmaceutically acceptable
 carrier. As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" is intended to
 include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents,
 isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical
 administration. Suitable carriers are described in the most recent edition of Remington's
 Pharmaceutical Sciences, a standard reference text in the field, which is incorporated herein
 by reference. Preferred examples of such carriers or diluents include, but are not limited to,
 water, saline, ringer's solutions, dextrose solution, and 5% human serum albumin.
 Liposomes and non-aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils may also be used. The use of such
 media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except
 insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use
 thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be
 incorporated into the compositions.
 [00469]         A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be
 compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration
 include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation),
 transdermal (i.e., topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions
 used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following
 components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils,
 polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial
 agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or
 sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); buffers
                                                143

WO 2013/163631                                                                PCT/US2013/038540
 such as acetates, citrates or phosphates, and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as
 sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as
 hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in
 ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.
 [00470]         Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile
 aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the
 extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous
 administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water,
 Cremophor ELTM (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases,
 the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability
 exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be
 preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.
 The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol,
 polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the
 like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by
 the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the
 case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms
 can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens,
 chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be
 preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol,
 sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable
 compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays
 absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
 [00471]         Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active
 compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of
 ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally,
 dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that
 contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those
 enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable
 solutions, methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying that yields a powder
 of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile
 filtered solution thereof.

 [00472]           Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier.
 They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral
 therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and
 used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared
 using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is
 applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible
 binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The
 tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or
 compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth
 or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid,
 Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such
 as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring
 agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.
 [00473]           For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of
 an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant,
 e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer.
 [00474]           Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means.
 For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be
 permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and
 include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid
 derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal
 sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are
 formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art.
 [00475]           The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with
 conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention
 enemas for rectal delivery.
 [00476]           In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that
 will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled
 release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems.
 Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate,
 polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods
 for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The
 materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova

 [00477]         It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in
 dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as
 used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be
 treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to
 produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical
 carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and
 directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular
 therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding
 such an active compound for the treatment of individuals.

 [00480]         Activatable anti-EGFR antibody expression andpurification. The cDNA
 coding for the heavy chain and the light chain of each of the activatable anti-EGFR
 antibodies were separately cloned into a modified pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector
 (Life Technologies). CHO-S cells (Life Technologies) were transiently transfected with the
 plasmids for each activatable anti-EGFR antibody for 5-7 days using FreeStyle MAX
 transfection reagent (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. The
 activatable anti-EGFR antibodies were purified using a HiTrap Mab Select Sure protein A
 column (GE Healthcare) coupled to an AKTA purifier (GE Healthcare). The purity and the
 homogeneity of purified activatable anti-EGFR antibodies were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in
 reducing and non-reducing conditions and size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex
 200, 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare), respectively.

 [00481]        Rate of activatableanti-EGFR antibody cleavage and Kcat/Km
 determination. Recombinant human uPA and MT-SP1 (R & D Systems; final
 concentrations of 1.6 - 100 nM) was incubated with 500 nM (uPA) and 2 pM (MT-SP1) in
 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 5 mM calcium chloride,
 (TBST) for 24 h at 370 C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 pl of sample to 7 pl of HT
 Protein Express Sample Buffer (Caliper LifeSciences) and incubating for 10 min at 95'C.
 Samples were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (GXII; Caliper LifeSciences) and
 concentrations of cleaved and uncleaved light chain were determined using LabChip GX
 software (Caliper LifeSciences). The kcat/Km were determined using the following
 equation:
                                  kca~t

 [00483]        Protease digestion/activation of activatable anti-EGFR antibody. The 3954
 1204-C225v4 activatable antibody, also referred to herein as Pb-1204, (100 ug) was
 incubated with various proteases: uPA (50 nM in PBS, pH 7.2), MT-SP1 (10 nM in PBS,
 pH 7.2), or legumain (30 ug/ml in 50 mM MES, 250 mM NaCl, pH 6.0) at room
 temperature for 4 days. For the cell proliferation and the EGFR binding assays, the uPA
 cleaved Pb-1204 was purified by protein A agarose affinity chromatography. The cleavage
 of Pb-1204 was analyzed by SDS PAGE and capillary electrophoresis (LabChip GXII;
 Caliper Life Sciences).
 [00484]        Cell culture andproliferationassays. H292 human lung cancer cells
 (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained at 37'C (5% C0 2) in RPMI medium
 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For proliferation assays, the cells were
 seeded at 3000 cells/well in a 96-well plate under low serum conditions (RPMI +1% FBS).
 The following day, antibodies or activatable anti-EGFR antibodies were added at the
 indicated concentrations and cells were incubated for an additional 4 days at 37C. Cell
 viability was measured using Cell-Titer Glo (Promega), according to the manufacturer's
 instructions.

 Hepes) and blocked with HBSS containing 1% BSA. The plates were incubated with the
 indicated concentrations of antibody or activatable anti-EGFR antibody in HBSS/1% BSA
 for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase
 (HRP) conjugated anti-human F(ab') 2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in HBSS for
 30 min. and the detection was performed by the addition of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine
 substrate (1-Step Ultra-TMB, Pierce) followed by an equal volume of IM hydrochloric
 acid. Absorbance at 450 nm was then measured and reported as optical density (OD 450
 nm).
 [004861         In some cases, the relative EGFR binding was converted to an IgG
 concentration using a cetuximab standard curve (1 nM starting concentration, 10 point serial
 dilutions). The standard curve was fitted on a 4 parameter curve and the results interpolated
 using the Elx 800 software.
 [00487]         Evaluation ofactivatableanti-EGFR antibody distributionin vivo by optical
 imaging. HT29 xenograft tumor bearing mice were injected intraperitoneally with 12.5
 mg/kg Alexa Fluor 750 conjugated activatable anti-EGFR antibodies. One hour before
 imaging the mice were injected intravenously with quenched PEGylated Cy5.5 substrate
 probes (2 nmol). The mice were imaged 24 h after activatable anti-EGFR antibody
 injection using an IVIS Spectrum/CT imaging system (Caliper LifeSciences). During the
 procedure, the mice were kept under gaseous anesthesia (5% isofluorane) at 37 C. Imaging
 at 750 nm is used to evaluate accumulation levels of the activatable anti-EGFR antibodies
 (e.g., 3954-1204-C225v4 or 3954-1204-C225v5 as well as the Pb-NSUB construct in which
 the protease substrate sequence from 3954-1204-C225v4 or 3954-1204-C225v5,
 respectively, has been replaced with a sequence that is not susceptible to protease cleavage),
 as distribution of the labeled activatable anti-EGFR antibody constructs at this wavelength
 is an indication of antibody activation and EGFR receptor binding. Imaging at 680 nm is
 used to evaluate the level of substrate cleavage by monitoring probe activation kinetics in
 tumor tissue. Finally, necropsy is used to evaluate biodistribution ex vivo.
 [00488]         Immunofluorescence. Seven days after the activatable anti-EGFR antibody
 injection the mice were sacrificed, and the tissues samples were excised and cryo-preserved.
 Samples of HT29 xenograft tumors and liver were sectioned (5 pm) at -20 C. Sections were
 stained with AlexaFluor488 conjugated donkey, anti-human IgG and counterstained with
 DAPI antifade mounting medium. The stained sections were imaged using a fluorescence
 microscope (Olympus IX 81) and an Imaging Software for Life Science Microscopy Cell.

 [00490]         Immunoprecipitationand Western Blotting. Tissues samples were
 homogenized in lysis buffer (HBSS/ 2% Triton X-100, Halt protease inhibitor cocktail;
 Thermo Fisher Scientific) using stainless steel beads containing Bullet Blender
 homogenization tubes (Next Advance) at a ratio of 1 g tumor/tissue per 2 ml lysis buffer.
 The tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 xg and the supernatant was further
 centrifuged at 20,800 x g at 4'C for 45 minutes. Tissues lysates were immediately
 incubated with 10 pl Goat anti-human IgG Fc Specific magnetic beads (Bangs Laboratories,
 Inc.), overnight at 4'C. Beads were washed and then eluted by denaturation in (5 minutes,
 95C) in LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) containing beta-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma, St.
 Louis, MO). The samples were electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, blotted using
 HRP-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The bands were
 visualized using the SuperSignal Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher
 Scientific) and the ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare).

 measurements were made 3X weekly once tumors become measureable. Animals were
 tumor size rank matched in cohorts (12 mice/group) with average tumor volumes of~150
 mm3 -200 mm3 and treatments were started. Animals were treated intravenously weekly for
 4 weeks. Tumors were measured with calipers twice a week for the duration of the study.
 Plasma was collected in K2EDTA from 3 mice per group at 1 h, 8 h, 24 h, 72 h, the blood
 collection was alternated between mice within a cohort. Four mice per group were
 euthanized on Day 3 and tumors were collected and snap frozen for analysis.
 [00493]         Another set of xenograft studies, using the LXFA677 xenograft model, was
 established at Oncotest GmbH from primary patient material after informed consent.
 Xenografts were subcutaneously grown in athymic NMRI nu/nu mice and randomized after
 reaching tumor volumes of 100-300 mm 3 . Mice (12/group) were treated with antibodies
 once a week intraperitoneally and tumors were measured with calipers twice weekly. Blood
 was collected in 3 mice per group once weekly and the blood collection was alternated
 between mice within a cohort. Four mice per group were euthanized on Day 3 and tumors
 were collected and snap frozen for analysis.
 [00494]         Immunohistochemistry: Samples of xenograft tumors and liver were
 sectioned (5 pm). Slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated in distilled water followed by
 retrieval with Citrate Buffer pH 6.0 (Thermo Scientific). Endogenous peroxidase was
 quenched with 0.3% Hydrogen Peroxide. Sections were blocked with the Avidin/Biotin
 blocking kit (Vector Laboratories) followed by 3% BSA. The sections were stained with
 Biotin-conjugated donkey, anti-human IgG (Jackson) antibodies utilizing the ABC Elite
 Detection kit (Vector Laboratories) and visualized with DAB (Pierce Scientific). The slides
 were counterstained with Hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared and cover-slipped. The stained
 sections were imaged using a bright field scope (Leica DM750) and LAS EZ software
 (Leica Application Suite).
 [00495]         Pharmacokinetics: Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were derived from
 cetuximab or activatable anti-EGFR antibody concentrations using a non-compartment

 Example 2. Preparation of Activatable Anti-EGFR Antibodies
 [00496]         The activatable anti-EGFR antibodies described herein include an antibody
 or antigen-binding fragment that is derived from the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab.
 Cetuximab is a well characterized therapeutic antibody approved for the treatment of
 colorectal and head and neck cancer. One cetuximab-based activatable anti-EGFR
 antibody, referred to herein as Pb-1204, was engineered by adding a 21 amino acid long
 binding peptide, i.e., the masking moiety, to the N-terminus of the light chain (Figure 2A).
 The mask was attached to the antibody through a 26 amino acid long linker carrying an 8
 residue long sequence that is an uPA, MT-SP1 or legumain specific substrate sequence.
 The efficiency, cleavage rate and selectivity of various proteases (uPA, MT-SP1, tissue
 plasminogen activator (tPA) and/or thrombin) with respect to the substrate within the Pb
 1204 activatable antibody (referred to herein as the 1204 substrate or simply 1204) is shown
 in Figures 9A-9D.
 [00497]         The efficiency and the specificity of cleavage of Pb-1204 by different
 proteases were evaluated. Pb-1204 was efficiently cleaved by human MT-SP1 (2200 M-I
 s-i 
 470 M-1 s-1) human uPA (530 M-1 s-I  40 M-I s-1) and legumain. However Pb-1204
 was not cleaved by tPA or plasmin, ADAM 9,10, and 17, kallikrein 5 and 7. Pb-1204 was
 digested to near completion and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, capillary electrophoresis and N
 terminal sequencing (Figures 2C and 5B). The N-terminal sequence of the cleaved products
 demonstrated the predicted cleavage sites for the three proteases. MT-SPI and uPA cleaved
 the Pb-1204 substrate sequence at the same P1 site and yielded light chain products of the
 same molecular weight. The cleavage by legumain yielded a slower migrating light chain
 that was shorter by 3 amino acids.
 Example 3. In vitro activity of activatable anti-EGFR antibodies
 [00498]         The relative in vitro activity of cetuximab, Pb-1204 and Pb-1204 digested to
 completion with uPA was evaluated next. The binding of Pb-1204 to EGFR was reduced
 by 23-fold relative to cetuximab showing an apparent       Kd of 0.36 nM compared to 0.02 nM
 respectively (Figure 5C). The apparent     Kd  of the fully activated Pb-1204 and cetuximab
 were identical (0.02 nM). The inhibitory activity of Pb-204 on H292 cell proliferation was
 reduced by 990-fold relative to cetuximab (IC5 o 46.6 nM and 0.05 nM respectively; Figure
                                                 151

WO 2013/163631                                                                 PCT/US2013/038540
 2D). Once activated, Pb-1204 showed an inhibitory activity comparable to cetuximab (IC50
 0.07 nM).
 Example 4. In vivo distribution of activatable anti-EGFR antibodies
 [00499]         To assess the in vivo distribution of the proteolytic activity susceptible of
 cleaving Pb-1204, near-infrared fluorescence self-quenched imaging (IQ) probes were used.
 An IQ probe bearing the substrate sequence of Pb-1204 (IQ-1204; Figure 3A) and a
 negative control IQ probe bearing a peptide linker without a substrate sequence (IQ-NSUB)
 were injected in HT29 tumor bearing mice. The term "NSUB" used herein refers to an
 amino acid substrate sequence that includes glycine and serine residues, but is not
 susceptible to protease cleavage. One hour after the injection of IQ-1204, the imaging
 showed fluorescence restricted to the tumor site (Figure 3B). The simultaneous imaging of
 these mice 48 hours after the injection with a fluorescently labeled Pb-1204 demonstrated a
 fluorescence distribution identical to IQ-1204 and restricted to the tumor. No fluorescence
 was detected in the animals injected with the IQ-NSUB and fluorescently labeled Pb-NSUB
 negative controls. Seven days after injection, the localization of the activatable anti-EGFR
 antibody in tumor and liver samples from treated mice using immunofluorescence staining
 was evaluated. Tumors of animals injected with Pb-1204 demonstrated membranous
 fluorescent staining on epithelial cells, whereas no staining was detected in tumors from
 mice injected with Pb-NSUB (Figures 3C and 3D). No staining was detected in liver
 samples from animals treated with Pb-1204 or Pb-NSUB (Figures 6A and 6B). These
 results indicate that the proteolytic activity associated with the tumor site specifically
 cleaves the 1204 substrate sequence. The cleavage of the substrate sequence allows the
 antibody to bind to its target and accumulate at the tumor site.
 Example 5. Analysis of activatable anti-EGFR antibodies in xenograft models
 [00500]         The effect of Pb-1204 on EGFR-dependent tumor growth was investigated
 using the NSCLC xenograft model H292. Tumor regression was seen in the Pb-1204
 treated group and the cetuximab control treated group (Figure 4A). The mean tumor
 volume between these treatment groups was not statistically different at study termination
 (day 20) suggesting that Pb-1204 was as effective as cetuximab. No statistically significant
 tumor reduction was seen in mice treated with Pb-NSUB control. In a subset of mice (n=4),
 plasma samples were collected at different times up to 72 hours at which point the mice
                                                 152

WO 2013/163631                                                               PCT/US2013/038540
 were sacrificed and the tumors were excised. Despite the circulating concentration of Pb
 1204 being higher than the cetuximab and Pb-NSUB concentrations, the resulting EGFR
 binding activity of Pb-1204 (2.2%  0.2) and Pb-NSUB (3.9%  0.3) was marginal
 compared to cetuximab (95.6%  3.5; Figure 4B). The concentrations of Pb-1204, Pb
NSUB and cetuximab found in the tumor were equivalent. The western blot analysis of
 lysates from these tumors showed that a significant fraction of the Pb-1204 had been
 activated, whereas the Pb-NSUB remained intact and unactivated. As expected the EGFR
 binding activity of Pb-1204 (51.6%  0.8) found in the tumors was greater than its activity
 in plasma or to the binding activity of Pb-NSUB (18.2%  0.3; Figure 4C).
 [00501]         Next, the activity of a single dose of Pb-1204 relative to cetuximab was
 determined in a patient derived non-small cell lung cancer tumor xenograft model
 (LXFA677). The activatable anti-EGFR antibody and the antibody were equally efficacious
 at inhibiting the tumor growth. At day 21, cetuximab had inhibited tumor growth by 96%
 and Pb-1204 bylOO% (Figure 4D). The plasma concentrations of cetuximab and Pb-1204
 were equivalent throughout the study (Figure 7B) with identical exposures (3331 pg/ml x
 day). The concentration EGFR binding activity in plasma was equivalent to the
 concentration of the antibody for cetuximab. However, for Pb-1204, the concentration of
 the EGFR binding activity was greatly diminished compared to the total concentration of
 circulating activatable anti-EGFR antibody. The exposure (day 1 - 28) for the EGFR
 binding activity of the Pb-1204 (1214 pg/ml x day) represented 36% of the exposure for the
 total activatable anti-EGFR antibody circulating concentration. Seventy two hours after
 treatment, the tumors from a subset of mice (n=4) were excised and evaluated for
 activatable anti-EGFR antibody and antibody concentration and activity. The average
 concentration of Pb-1204 in the tumor was equivalent to the concentration of cetuximab. A
 considerable fraction (35  4%) of the activatable anti-EGFR antibody found in the tumors
 demonstrated EGFR binding activity.
 [00502]          In summary, through the development of two bacterial display screening
 platforms, an inhibitory binding peptide for cetuximab, i.e., a mask, and a novel peptide
 substrate for the proteases MT-SP1, uPA and legumain was identified. The parental
 antibody was modified to link the inhibitory peptide to the N-terminus of the light chain
 trough a flexible peptide linker bearing the novel peptide substrate. This activatable anti
 EGFR antibody was named Pb-1204. The in vitro characterization of Pb-1204 showed that
 the masking peptide considerably inhibited the activity of the activatable anti-EGFR
                                                 153

 activation of the activatable anti-EGFR antibody by MT-SP1, uPA and legumain, and once
 activated, the activatable anti-EGFR antibody demonstrated an activity equal to cetuximab.
In vivo, Pd-1204 remained stable in circulation and in normal tissues but was efficiently
 activated in xenograft tumors. The specific tumor activation of Pb-1204 led to an anti
 tumor efficacy that was equivalent to cetuximab.
 [00503]         Thus, the activatable anti-EGFR antibodies described herein are useful in
 improving the therapeutic window of a majority of antibody therapeutics demonstrating
 target mediated toxicity. In addition, the use of the activatable anti-EGFR antibody expands
 the cancer target landscape by allowing the development of cancer therapeutics directed
 toward targets that cannot be considered with traditional antibodies due to associated
 toxicities.
 Example 6. Analysis of activatable anti-EGFR antibodies in non-human primate
 models
 [00504]         Among the toxicities seen in humans and non-human primates administered
 cetuximab is skin rash, including papulopustular rash of face and upper trunk, and dry and
 itchy skin. In the studies described herein, the activatable anti-EGFR antibody 3954-1204
 C225v5 was evaluated using a non-human primate animal model. Briefly, three groups of 3
 female cynomolgus monkeys were dosed intravenously (IV) with cetuximab (i.e.,
 unmodified cetuximab), 3954-1204-C225v5, or Pb-NSUB (i.e., 3954-NSUB-C225v5, an
 activatable anti-EGFR antibody that includes the NSUB sequence that is not susceptible to
 protease cleavage), respectively. A 40 mg/kg loading dose was administered (three 2-hour
 infusions spread over 5 days), followed by a 25 mg/kg dose that was administered weekly
 (two 2-hour infusions per week). The animals were dosed over a 5-week period (last dose
 was administered on day 32), followed by a 4-week treatment-free recovery phase. All
 animals examined daily for skin rash. All animals were also subject to clinical chemistry
 and hematology analysis as well as TK and immunogenicity. As shown in Figure 12 and
 Table 4, the animals that were administered the activatable anti-EGFR antibody 3954-1204
 C225v5 exhibited no detectable rash as compared to those that were administered
 cetuximab. In addition, the animals that were administered the activatable anti-EGFR
 antibody 3954-1204-C225v5 exhibited reduced dermatological toxicity as compared to
 those that were administered cetuximab.

 1005071         A pharmacokinetic study comparing serum concentrations over time

 0.5 days while the half-life of cetuximab was 3.2 0.4 days. An exemplary study showing
the half-life of the anti-EGFR activatable antibody 3954-1204-C225v5 as compared to the
half-life of cetuximab is shown in Figure 19. The half-life of cetuximab was similar to
previously reported values. The pharmacokinetics of the anti-EGFR activatable antibody
 3954-1204-C225v5 is consistent with lack of systemic antigen-mediated clearance (EGFR
 in normal tissues).

 Example 7. Imaging and Immunohistochemistry Staining of Tumor Tissues with All
 Active Site Antibodies
 [00508]          The studies described herein were designed to demonstrate that a target
 protease of the activatable anti-EGFR antibodies described herein, specifically the MT-SPl
 protease, is active in tumor tissue.
 [00509]         As shown in Figures 14A-14C, in vivo imaging and immunohistochemistry
 (IHC) staining of tumor tissues with Al 1 active site antibodies (Darragh et al., "Tumor
 detection by imaging proteolytic activity." Cancer Res. 70 (2010): 1505-1512) confirmed
 the presence of active MT-SP1 in the H292 xenograft model. All is an antibody that
 specifically binds to the active site of the MT-SP1 protease, also known as matriptase.
 Example 8. In situ Imaging of Anti-EGFR Activatable Antibodies
 [00510]          The present Example describes the use of in situ imaging of the activation
 and binding of an anti-EGFR activatable antibody of the disclosure. The results indicate
 that anti-EGFR activatable antibodies of the disclosure can be activated by proteases
 expressed by a tissue and bind EGFR targets on that tissue.
 [00511]         In situ imaging of activatable antibodies represents a unique approach to
 characterize protease activity in cells and tissues. This technology enables validation of
 activatable antibody activation and binding to a target in histological sections of cells and
 tissues expressing proteases capable of cleaving the activatable antibody. A schematic of
 such an in situ approach is presented in Figure 15.
 [00512]         In situ imaging of the activation and binding of an anti-EGFR activatable
 antibody (also referred to herein as in situ imaging) by a cell or tissue capable of cleaving
 the activatable antibody at a site co-localized with the target recognized by the activated
 antibody was conducted as follows: Frozen tissue sections were laid over glass slides. A
 solution containing labeled anti-EGFR activatable antibodies (labeled, e.g., with a
 fluorescent tag) was applied on the tissue and incubated, e.g., for 1 hour at room
 temperature (about 22-24'C) in an incubation buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.4,
 containing 150 mM NaCl, 100 pM ZnCl 2, 5 mM CaCl 2 and 0.050%Tween 20; activatable
 antibody at a concentration of about 1 pg/ml. The conditions of such an incubation can be
 adjusted to be conducive to the cleavage agent in the tissue section by, for example, varying
 the pH of the solution (e.g., within a range of about pH 7 to about pH 8.5), the temperature
 of the incubation (e.g., within a range of about 20'C to about 40'C, e.g., room temperature
                                                 156

WO 2013/163631                                                               PCT/US2013/038540
 or 370 C), the incubation time (e.g., within a range of about 15 minutes to about 150
 minutes, and/or the activatable antibody concentrations (e.g., within a range of about 0.05
 pg/ml to about 10 pg/ml). The tissue was then extensively washed to remove non-bound
 material and detectable label was measured. For example, when a fluorescent tag was used,
 the tissue was submitted to fluorescent microscopy. Detection of activated antibody on the
 tissue indicated that the tissue expressed proteases that cleaved the activatable antibody and
 also expressed EGFR targets to which the activated antibody bound.
 [005131          The ability of anti-EGFR activatable antibody 3954-1204-C225v5 to be
 activated and to bind frozen human lung cancer tissue was evaluated using in situ imaging.
 The activatable antibody was labeled with Alexa Fluor* 680 (Invitrogen) to produce labeled
 activatable antibody 3954-1204-C225v5-AF680. The labeled activatable antibody was
 incubated with a frozen human lung cancer tissue sample as described above. The results
 are shown in Figure 16, panel A. The red fluorescent tissue image demonstrates binding of
 C225v5 antibody activated by tissue-derived proteolytic cleavage of the anti-EGFR
 activatable antibody. The identical pattern of tissue staining was detected by exposing an
 EGFR antibody (monoclonal rabbit anti-EGFR antibody, Cell Signaling) to the tissue, as
 shown in Figure 16, panel B. The fluorescent signal shown in panel A was inhibited by pre
 treatment of the tissue with a 1:100 dilution of broad spectrum inhibitor cocktail set III
 (539134, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and 50 mM EDTA, as shown in Figure 16, panel
 C. Blue staining represents DAPI nuclear staining.
 [00514]          Figure 17 demonstrates that 3954-1204-C225v5 is activatable in a wide
 range of human tumor samples. Column 2 indicates the expression level of EGFR receptor,
 as detected by an EGFR antibody (monoclonal rabbit anti-EGFR antibody, Cell Signaling),
 for the various human cancer tissue samples. Column 3 indicates the amount of active
 matriptase (MT-SP 1), as detected by antibody Al 1, in the various human cancer tissue
 samples. Columns 4 and 5 represent an evaluation of in situ activation and binding of the
 EGFR activatable antibody (col. 5) as compared to cetuximab (Cetux) tissue staining (col.
 4). The staining that measures the amount of EGFR, All and cetuximab antibodies binding
 to the tissue sample was scored from 0 to 3+: 0, no staining; 1+ (i.e., "+"), weak staining;
 2+ (i.e., "++"), moderate staining; and 3+ (i.e., "+++"), strong staining. The activatable
 antibody in situ imaging staining scoring is based on comparison with cetuximab antibody
 staining and defined as follows: 0, no staining; 1+ (i.e., "+"), weak staining as compared to
 parental antibody; 2+ (i.e., "++"), moderate staining as compared to parental antibody; and
                                                 157

WO 2013/163631                                                                PCT/US2013/038540
 3+ (i.e., "+++"), analogous staining to parental antibody. As shown in Figure 17, high
 levels of active matriptase have been observed in 8 of 9 samples from colorectal cancer
 (CRC) tumors, and high levels of active matriptase have been observed in samples from 5
 of 10 lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors. No active matriptase was observed in samples from
 adjacent healthy lung tissue.
 [00515]          These data suggest the utility of in situ imaging in methods of effectively and
 efficiently identifying or otherwise refining a patient population suitable for treatment with
 an anti-EGFR activatable antibody of the disclosure, such as activatable antibody 3954
 1204-C225v5. For example, patients that test positive for both the target (e.g., EGFR) and
 the protease that cleaves the substrate in the cleavable moiety (CM) of the anti-EGFR
 activatable antibody (e.g., MT-SP1) using these in situ imaging techniques could be
 identified as suitable candidates for treatment with the anti-EGFR activatable antibody
 being tested. Likewise, patients that test negative for either or both of the target (e.g.,
 EGFR) and the protease that cleaves the substrate in the CM (e.g., MT-SP1) using these in
 situ imaging techniques are identified as suitable candidates for another form of therapy
 (i.e., not suitable for treatment with the anti-EGFR activatable antibody being tested). In
 some embodiments, such patients can be tested with other anti-EGFR activatable antibodies
 until a suitable anti-EGFR activatable antibody for treatment is identified (e.g., an anti
 EGFR activatable antibody comprising a CM that is cleaved by the patient at the site of
 disease).
 Example 9. Activatable Antibodies Conjugated to an Agent
 [00516]          The present Example demonstrates the ability of an activatable antibody
 agent conjugate of the disclosure to inhibit tumor growth.
 [00517]          Activatable antibody 3954-1204-C225v5 was conjugated to monomethyl
 auristatin E (MMAE), a synthetic anti-mitotic tubulin polymerization inhibitor via a Val
 Cit-based linker (K-lock C5-vc-PAB; Concortis Biosystems Corp., San Diego, CA), to
 generate activatable antibody-agent conjugate 3954-1204-C225v5-MMAE. The in vivo
 efficacy of 3954-1204-C225v5-MMAE relative to 3954-1204-C225v5 and to cetuximab
 was tested using the H292 lung cancer cell line xenograft mouse model. The H292
 xenograft model was established by inoculating 6-8 week old female NU/J (JAX #2019)
 mice subcutaneously in the right hind flank with 5 X 106 NCI-H292 cells (ATCC)
 suspended 1:1 with MatrigelTM in serum-free media. Tumor volume measurements were

 made 3 times (3X) weekly once tumors became measureable. Animals were tumor-size
 rank-matched in cohorts (8 mice/group) with average tumor volumes of~150 mm 3 -200
 mm3 , and treatments were administered to the groups 1 time on day 0 as follows: (a) 12.5
 mg/kg 3954-1204-C225v5-MMAE, applied intravenously; (b) 2.5 mg/kg 3954-1204
 C225v5-MMAE, applied intravenously; (c) 12.5 mg/kg rituxan-MMAE (i.e., rituximab
 MMAE; rituximab is available from Genentech, So. San Francisco, CA), applied
 intravenously; (d) 12.5 mg/kg 3954-1204-C225v5, applied intraperitoneally; (e) 12.5 mg/kg
 cetuximab, applied intraperitoneally; or (f) 12.5 mg/kg IVIg, applied intraperitoneally.
 Tumors were measured with calipers twice weekly for the duration of the study.
 [00518]         As shown in Figure 18, a single injection of 12.5 mg/kg activatable antibody
 agent conjugate 3954-1204-C225v5-MMAE demonstrated significant efficacy compared to
 12.5 mg/kg IVIg (92% tumor reduction; p     =  0.0000003), as did a single injection of 12.5
 mg/kg cetuximab (78% tumor reduction; p      =  0.000006) 28 days after administration. The
 efficacy of 3954-1204-C225v5-MMAE was significantly higher than that of cetuximab at
 this dose (p=0.0 3 ) at day 28. A reduced efficacy was recorded for a lower dose (2.5 mg/kg)
 of 3954-1204-C225v5-MMAE (p=0.00 7 ) and as well as for a dose of 12.5 mg/kg rituxan
 MMAE (p=0.00 8 ) at day 28. No statistically significant efficacy was observed for
 activatable antibody 3954-1204-C225v5 at 12.5 mg/kg (p      =  0.06 at day 28).
 [00519]         An additional dose fractionation study in the same H292 xenograft tumor
 model was run to compare the activity of cetuximab, activatable antibody 3954-1204
 C225v5-MMAE administered at a single dose of 12.5 mg/kg or administered twice weekly
 (at Days 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14) doses of2.5 mg/kg each for a total of 5 doses (total of 12.5
 mg/kg activatable antibody administered over the study). This dose fractionation study used
 the same control (12.5 mg/kg IVIg) and methods described above for the H292 xenograft
 model, EGFR binding assay, and cell culture and proliferation assays. In this dose
 fractionation study, the activatable antibody 3954-1204-C225v5-MMAE was well tolerated,
 as evidenced by the lack of weight loss in treated mice. A single control animal was
 euthanized on Day 23 with body weight loss >20%, but all other animals survived through
 Day 35.
 [00520]         Significant anti-tumor activity was seen in all activatable antibody 3954
 1204-C225v5-MMAE and cetuximab treated groups as shown in Table 5 below, where
 values greater than 100% represent tumor shrinkage.

 [00521]         Cetuximab as a single dose of 12.5 mg/kg produced tumor stasis or tumor
 regression in 8/8 mice; however, the effect was short lived with 6/8 mice showing evidence
 of tumor regrowth on Day 35. Cetuximab as a fractionated dose of 2.5 mg/kg likewise
 produced tumor stasis or regression in all animals followed by regrowth in 5/8 mice by Day
 35. Administration of the activatable antibody 3954-1204-C225v5-MMAE as a single dose
 of 12.5 mg/kg had a more pronounced anti-tumor effect, resulting in tumor regressions in
 7/7 mice, with no evidence of tumor regrowth by Day 35. Twice weekly administration of
 2.5 mg/kg 3954-1204-C225v5-MMAE yielded tumor regressions in 8/8 mice, only one of
 which showed evidence of tumor regrowth on Day 35. Statistical analysis of the Day 35
 tumor volumes showed that both regimens using 3954-1204-C225v5-MMAE were
 significantly more efficacious than the fractionated dose of cetuximab (one way ANOVA
 p<0.005 in each case). The same was true when comparing to the cetuximab single dose
 group. There was no significant difference on Day 35 between the activities of the two
 regimens using 3954-1204-C225v5-MMAE (p=0. 2 2 using a two-tailed t-test).
 [00522]         In conclusion, the activatable anti-EGFR antibody-agent conjugate 3954
 1204-C225v5-MMAE showed robust and durable efficacy in the H292 tumor model, with
 activity superior to a matching dose of cetuximab. The activatable antibody-agent
 conjugate 3954-1204-C225v5-MMAE was equally effective when administered as a single
 dose of 12.5 mg/kg or a repeated dose of 2.5 mg/kg given twice weekly for a total of 5
 doses.

 Example 10. In Vitro Characterization of an Activatable Antibody Conjugated to an
 Agent
 [00523]          This Example describes the ability of an activatable antibody-agent
 conjugate of the disclosure to retain binding to EGFR and inhibit proliferation of H292 cells
 in culture.
 [00524]          Anti-EGFR activatable antibody 3954-1204-C225v5 was conjugated to
 monomethylauristatin E (MMAE), a synthetic anti-mitotic tubulin polymerization inhibitor
 as described in the Examples herein, to generate activatable antibody-agent conjugate 3954
 1204-C225v5-MMAE. The average drug to antibody ratio (DAR) was 3.44.
 [00525]          The abilities of the following compounds to bind EGFR in an ELISA-based
 assay and to inhibit H292 cell proliferation in cell culture were determined: Anti-EGFR
 activatable antibody-agent conjugate 3954-1204-C225v5-MMAE; anti-EGFR activatable
 antibody-agent conjugate 3954-1204-C225v5-MMAE activated by uPA; anti-EGFR
 activatable antibody 3954-1204-C225v5; anti-EGFR activatable antibody 3954-1204
 C225v5 activated by uPA; and anti-EGFR antibody C225v5. Activation of activatable
 antibody and activatable antibody-agent conjugate was effected by digestion overnight at
 37 0 C with active site-titrated uPA (500nM) in Tris pH 8.5; activation was measured by CE
 analysis (LabChip GXII). uPA-activated activatable antibody and uPA-activated
 activatable antibody-agent conjugate were purified using protein A and then stored at 4C
 prior to the study.
 [00526]          For the ELISA-based binding experiments, EGFR-Fc (R&D Systems) was
 coated to the wells of a 96-well ELISA plate. A 1:3 serial dilution of the compounds was
 applied to the plate and allowed to bind. Bound antibody was visualized with an anti-human
 F(ab') 2 IgG-HRP conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and developed with
 the chromogenic substrate TMB.         Figure 20A demonstrates that conjugation of MMAE to
 the activatable antibody did not interfere with the ability of the masking moiety to inhibit
 binding of the activatable antibody to EGFR. In addition, conjugation of MMAE to the
 uPA-activated activatable antibody did not alter the activated antibody's ability to bind to
 EGFR.
 [00527]          For the cell proliferation assay, the human lung cancer cell line H292 was
 obtained from ATCC. H292 cells were grown in complete media (RPMI-1640
 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) at 37 0 C in an atmosphere of 5% C02 in air.
 H292 cells were harvested during the logarithmic growth period, resuspended in complete

 medium, and plated at a density of 10,000 cells per well in a 96-well white wall chimney
 plate. Following overnight incubation, a 10-point 1:3 serial dilution, starting at 10 pg/ml
 and ending in essentially 0 pg/ml of each compound was added to cells in culture in
 replicates. Cells were cultured for 3 days and cell viability was measured using CellTiterGlo
 (Promega) following manufacturer's protocol and a luminometer (Tecan). Data were
 analyzed using Prism GraphPad. Figure 20B demonstrates that conjugation of MMAE to
 the uPA-activated activatable antibody increases the activated antibody's cell-killing
 activity. In addition, conjugation of MMAE to the activatable antibody did not interfere
 with the ability of the masking moiety to inhibit cell killing by the uncleaved activatable
 antibody.
 Example 11. In situ Imaging of Anti-EGFR Activatable Antibodies
 [00528]         The present Example describes the use of an in situ imaging approach to
 screen a patient's tissue samples for the activation and binding of an anti-EGFR activatable
 antibody. The results indicate that anti-EGFR activatable antibodies of the disclosure can be
 activated by proteases expressed by a cancer patient's tissue and bind to EGFR receptor on
 that tissue.
 [00529]         Human colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and liver
 metastasis tissue samples were profiled for EGFR and MT-SP 1 expression by treating
 frozen tissue with labeled EGFR and Al 1 antibodies at 1 pg/ml and 5 pg/ml concentrations,
 respectively for 1 hour (Figure 21 and Tables 6-8). Furthermore, the ability of anti-EGFR
 activatable antibody 3954-1204-C225V5 to be activated and to bind human tumor or liver
 metastasis tissues was evaluated using in situ imaging. The activatable antibody was labeled
 with Alexa Fluor@ 680 (Invitrogen) as described above. The resultant activatable antibody
 3954-1204-C225V5-AF680 (also referred to as 1204-C225v5 or 1204-C225) was incubated
 with frozen patient tissue samples according to the protocol of in situ imaging described
 herein. Figure 22 illustrates the ability of colorectal cancer liver metastasis tissues to
 activate and bind anti-EGFR activatable antibodies. The results on the ability of cancer
 patient's tissue samples to activate and bind anti-EGFR activatable antibodies are
 summarized in the Tables 6-8. The IHC staining that measures the amount of EGFR and
 Al 1 antibodies binding to the tissue sample was scored from 0 to 3+: 0, no staining; 1+
 (i.e., "+"), weak staining; 2+ (i.e., "++"), moderate staining; and 3+ (i.e., "+++"), strong

 compared to parental antibody; 2+ (i.e., "++"), moderate staining as compared to parental
 antibody; and 3+ (i.e., "+++"), analogous staining to parental antibody.

 Example 12. Quantification of in situ Imaging of Anti-EGFR Activatable Antibodies
 [00530]          The present Example describes in situ imaging of the activation and binding
 of an anti-EGFR activatable antibody to biological tissues ex vivo in combination with anti
 EGFR antibody IHC and All antibody IHC. The use of commercially available anti-EGFR
 antibody IHC allows one to normalize the staining of parental antibody (e.g. cetuximab) and
 anti-EGFR activatable antibody to the quantity of EGFR expression in a tissue. Co-staining
 with EGFR antibodies also enables qualitative quantification of in situ imaging of anti
 EGFR activatable antibodies relative to the cetuximab staining normalized to EGFR
 expression. Quantification of the fluorescent signal can be performed using bioanalytical
 software for research imaging, such as MetaMorph. The staining of tissue with antibody that
 specifically recognizes the active site of MT-SP1 (antibody Al 1) can also be performed to
 monitor the activity of MT-SP 1, an enzyme that proteolytically cleaves the substrate of
 activatable antibodies 3954-1204-C225v4, 3954-1204-C225v5, and 3954-1204-C225v6.
 [00531]          Quantification of in situ imaging of anti-EGFR activatable antibody cleavage
 by a cell or tissue performed in combination with EGFR IHC was conducted as follows:
 Frozen tissue sections were laid over glass slides and rinsed in lx PBS-T. A solution
 containing labeled anti-EGFR activatable antibodies (labeled, e.g., with a fluorescent tag)
 was applied on the tissue and incubated, e.g., for 1 hour at room temperature in an
 incubation buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl, 100 PM
 ZnCl 2, 5 mM CaCl 2 and 0.05% Tween 20; activatable antibody at a concentration of about 1
 pg/ml. The tissue was then rinsed in lx PBS-T to remove non-bound material, and
 endogenous IgG was blocked with 3% BSA. Sections were incubated with commercially
 available anti-Rabbit, anti-EGFR antibodies and labeled Al 1 antibodies (labeled, e.g., with
 a fluorescent tag), e.g., for 1 hour at room temperature. After rinsing, secondary antibody
 Anti-Rabbit IgG labeled with a fluorescent tag was applied and incubated on the sections
 e.g., for 30 minutes at room temperature at a concentration of 5 P g/ml to amplify the
 primary antibody. Sections were rinsed and detectable label was measured. For example,
 when a fluorescent tag was used, the tissue was submitted to fluorescent microscopy. The
 ability of anti-EGFR activatable antibody to be activated and to bind to the receptor in situ
 was quantified by the following equation:
                                (Ab EGFR Pb in situ imaging)
                    PbA=        (Pb EGFR Ab in situ imaging)           -100%

 PbA = % of anti-EGFR activatable antibody activation and binding as compared to parental
 antibody (e.g. cetuximab), Ab EGFR = staining intensity of EGFR IHC on the section with
 cetuximab binding, Pb EGFR = staining intensity of EGFR IHC on the section with anti
 EGFR activatable antibody in situ imaging, Ab in situ imaging = intensity of cetuximab
 binding, Pb in situ imaging = intensity of anti-EGFR activatable antibody binding.
 [00532]          Human esophageal and pancreatic cancer tissue samples were profiled for
 EGFR and MT-SP1 expression; the ability of anti-EGFR activatable antibody 3 954-1204
 C225v5 to be activated and to bind human tumor was evaluated using in situ imaging. The
 activatable antibody was labeled with Alexa Fluor@ 680 (Invitrogen) as described above.
 The resultant activatable antibody 3954-1204-C225v5-AF680 was incubated with frozen
 patient tissue samples according to the protocol of in situ imaging described herein.
 Furthermore, EGFR and Alexa Fluor@ 750 labeled All antibodies were used by treating
 frozen tissue with at 1 pg/ml and 5 pg/ml concentrations, respectively for 1 hour. Figure 23
 illustrates the ability of esophageal cancer tissues to activate and bind anti-EGFR
 activatable antibodies. The results on the ability of esophageal and pancreatic cancer
 patients' tissue samples to activate and bind anti-EGFR activatable antibodies are
 summarized in Table 9. The IHC staining that measures the amount of Cetuximab, EGFR
 and All antibodies binding to the tissue sample was scored from 0 to 3+: 0, no staining; 1+
 (i.e., "+"), weak staining; 2+ (i.e., "++"), moderate staining; and 3+ (i.e., "+++"), strong
 staining. The in situ imaging of anti-EGFR activatable antibodies staining was quantified
 based on comparison with cetuximab antibody staining normalized to EGFR staining and
 calculated by the equation described above.

 column of images. Figure 23, middle column of images, demonstrates co-localization of
 matriptase (MT-SPl) activity with EGFR expression. As used herein, the term "co
 localization" is not intended to imply any overlay or other overlap of the EGFR and/or All
