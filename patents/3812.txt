                                                ABSTRACT
Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is a stress-responsive cytokine known to be
associated with adverse events in heart failure patients. The use of serelaxin has been shown
to affect GDF- 15 levels at baseline and decreases in GDF- 15 levels over time. Measuring
GDF-15 levels allows a healthcare provider to accurately predict pulmonary load in patients
with pulmonary congestion.

                                             USE OF SERELAXIN TO REDUCE GDF-15
This application is a divisional application of Australian Application No. 2015273097 the
specification and drawings of which as originally filed are incorporated herein in their entirety by
reference.
                                                              FIELD
The invention relates to the field of therapeutic intervention in cardiovascular disease. More
particularly, it relates to growth differentiation factor 15, a pro-inflammatory peptide. It
further relates to serelaxin, a hormone recently shown to be effective in treating heart failure.
                                                           BACKGROUND
Heart failure is a disease in which the heart is unable to supply enough blood to meet the
body's needs. It is the leading cause of hospitalization in people 65 years of age or older and
the prevalence is expected to rise as the population ages and survival rates following
myocardial infarction improve. Acute heart failure is associated with a high risk of in-hospital
and post-discharge mortality due to the rapid onset or change in the signs and symptoms of
heart failure.
Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension present with a sustained elevation of pulmonary
arterial pressure and a low mean capillary wedge pressure and left ventricular end diastolic
pressure. Pulmonary arterial hypertension can be idiopathic (primary) or can develop in the
setting of other disorders. The main vascular changes are vasoconstriction, thrombosis and
proliferation of smooth muscle and endothelial cells. An imbalance of vasodilation and
vasoconstriction is the result of pulmonary endothelial cell dysfunction or injury.
Consequently, the lung develops intimal fibrosis, increased medial thickness, pulmonary
arteriolar occlusions and plexiform lesions. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is often an end
stage manifestation of pathological conditions, including heart failure, collagen vascular
disease, portal hypertension and HIV.
Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is a member of the TGF-beta superfamily. TGF-beta
family members have pleiotropic effects on cell motility and adhesion, cell cycle and
inflammation. GDF-15 is a stress-responsive cytokine known to have a role in regulating
inflammatory and apoptotic pathways in injured tissues and during disease, as well as having
general anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. It is not normally expressed in
most tissues except when induced by pathological processes. GDF-15 is up-regulated following
acute injury to

                                                   2
the heart, liver, kidney, and lung and its elevations at baseline have been shown to be associated
with worse outcomes in chronic heart failure, while its increases over time in heart failure patients
were shown to be associated both with worsening of echocardiographic parameters and adverse
outcomes (Wang et al., Biomarkers 15:671 (2010)). Elevated GDF-15 was recently suggested in
some preliminary studies to be no less predictive of long-term mortality than other biomarkers such
as NTproBNP, hsCRP, Galectin 3 or hsTnT (Lok et al., Lancet 381:29-39 (2013)). However, to
date no studies have previously evaluated GDF-1 5 in patients with acute heart failure (AlF).
While GDF- 15 has been suggested as a marker for the risk of heart failure, its role in cardiovascular
disease remains unknown. Many agents induce GDF-1 5 expression via multiple pathways. The
available data fail to establish a role for GDF- 15 in the diagnosis, prognosis or treatment of
cardiovascular disease.
Despite efforts to determine whether current therapies can reduce the risk of elevated GDF- 15 in
cardiovascular disease, the factors regulating GDF levels remain unclear. Findings that current
therapies increase, decrease and produce no effect on GDF-1 have all been reported. For example,
the PLATO trial found that treating patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome
lowered their GDF- 15 levels, regardless of whether the treatment was invasive or non-invasive and
regardless of whether they were given clopidogrel or ticagrelor (Wallentin et al., Circulation
129:293 (2014)). Left ventricular assist devices implanted in end stage heart failure patients in
order to provide volume and pressure unloading of the left ventricle also lowered their GDF- 15
levels (Lok et al, Eur J Heart Failure 14:1249-1256 (2012)). Also, optimizing beta-blocker therapy
decreased GDF- 15 in systolic chronic heart failure patients (Apostolovic et al., J Heart Failure
12:Suppl 1, S200 (2013)).
Conversely, optimizing beta-blocker therapy was observed to increase GDF- 15 in diastolic chronic
heart failure patients and was observed to have no effect on systolic chronic heart failure patients
(Eur J Heart Failure 11:Suppl 1, S45 (2012)). Valsartan treatment of patients with symptomatic
heart failure had no effect on GDF-15 but was observed to lower the heart failure biomarker B-type
natriuretic peptide (Anand et al., Circulation 122:1387-1395 (2010)). Similarly, even though GDF-

    WO 2015/189790                                                              PCT/IB2015/054399
                                                  3
15 has been detected in atherosclerotic plaque macrophages and infarcted myocardium, statins did
not affect GDF-15 levels (Bonaca et al., Arterioscl Thromb Vasc Biol 31:203-210 (2011)).
Recent clinical trials testing tezosentan, levosimendan, tolviptan and rolofylline failed to
demonstrate safety and/or efficacy in treating acute heart failure. Even drugs that have been
approved, e.g., milrinone, nesiritide and levosimendan, have raised persistent safety concerns. The
agents now used to treat acute heart failure have not been substantially added to or improved upon
in several decades. Furthermore, none of the drugs that are approved or are in development are
associated with GDF-15 levels.
  Serelaxin is a recombinant form of human serelaxin-2 (HR-2), a naturally occurring peptide
hormone which increases during pregnancy, mediates maternal physiological cardiovascular and
renal adaptations, and has potential protective effects on organ damage. Serelaxin binds to the
RXFP1 receptor in the renal and systemic vasculature and in the epithelium of the kidney mediating
multiple beneficial effects in acute heart failure including increased arterial compliance, cardiac
output, and renal blood flow. In a recently completed Phase 3 trial, serelaxin provided rapid relief
of dyspnea and reduced mortality at six months in patients with acute heart failure (Teerlink et al.,
Lancet 381:29-39 (2013).
The inventors have surprisingly found that the use of serelaxin can be used to lower GDF-15 levels
in patients with cardiovascular disease, and is particularly useful in lowering GDF-15 levels in
patients with acute heart failure. The inventors have also discovered a method of assessing
pulmonary load in a patient with pulmonary congestion. Furthermore, the inventors have
discovered that GDF- 15 provides a biomarker for assessing pulmonary hemodynamics and informs
the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of heart failure.
                                  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
  The invention provides a method of assessing pulmonary load in a patient with pulmonary

                              DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Initially, any reference to biological samples suitable for assay shall be understood to be any
samples known in the art and include, but are not limited, to blood, plasma, serum, buffy coat,
leukocytes, lymph, sputum, urine, feces, synovial fluid, synovial cells, cerebrospinal fluid, tears,
saliva, hair bulb cells, buccal swabs, and tissue samples. One of skill in the art would realize that
some samples would be more readily analyzed following a fractionation or purification procedure.
Similarly, assay methods can be any known in the art and include, but are not limited to,
immunoassays of any type, e.g., electrochemiluminescent immunoassay, ELISA or Western blot,
HPLC, flow cytometry, Southern blot, electrophoresis and polymerase chain reaction.
The term "assaying" refers to the act of identifying, screening, probing or determining which act
may be performed by any conventional means. For example, a sample may be assayed for the
presence of or to determine the amount of a particular agent by using an immunoassay, imaging,
Northern blot, etc. for the purpose of determining whether that agent is present in a sample or
determining the amount of the agent in the sample. The terms "assaying" and "determining"
contemplate a transformation of matter, e.g., a transformation of a biological sample from one state
to another by means of subjecting that sample to physical testing.
Further, as used herein, the terms "assaying' and "determining" are used to mean testing and/or
measuring. The phrase "assaying a biological sample from the patient for. . . "and the like are used

    WO 2015/189790                                                             PCT/IB2015/054399
                                                   7
to mean that a sample may be tested, either directly or indirectly, for either the presence or absence
of a given agent (e.g., GDF-15, gene, SNP, protein, etc.) or the amount of a particular agent. It is
understood that when an amount of an agent denotes one probability and a different amount of the
agent denotes another probability, the amount of the agent may be used to guide a diagnostic,
prognostic or therapeutic decision. It is understood that when the presence of an agent denotes one
probability and the absence of the agent denotes another probability, either the presence or the
absence of the agent may then be used to guide a diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic decision.
As used herein, "selection," "selectively," "selecting" and "selected" in reference to a patient is
used to mean that a particular patient is specifically chosen from a larger group of patients on the
basis of the patient having a predetermined criterion. Similarly, "selectively treating" refers to that
patient being specifically chosen from a larger group of patients on the basis of the chosen patient
having a predetermined criterion. "Selectively administering" refers to administering a drug to a
patient specifically chosen from a larger group of patients on the basis of the chosen patient having
a predetermined criterion. By "selecting," "selectively treating" and "selectively administering," it
is meant that a patient is delivered a personalized therapy based on the patient's particular biology,
rather than being delivered a standard treatment regimen based solely on the patient having a
particular disease. Selecting does not refer to the fortuitous diagnosis, prognosis or treatment of a
patient but rather refers to the deliberate choice to administer treatment to a patient based on one or
more predetermined criteria.
As used herein, the term "predicting" indicates that the methods described herein provide
information to enable a health care provider to determine the likelihood that an individual having a
disorder will have a more accurate diagnosis or prognosis or respond more favorably to treatment.
It does not refer to an ability to predict response with 100% accuracy. The skilled artisan will
understand that it refers to an increased probability.
As used herein, "likelihood and "likely" provide a description of how probable an event is to occur.
It may be used interchangeably with "probability." Likelihood refers to a probability that is more
than speculation but less than certainty. Thus, an event is likely if a reasonable person using
common sense, training or experience concludes that, given the circumstances, the event is

    WO 2015/189790                                                              PCT/IB2015/054399
                                                   8
probable. In some embodiments, once likelihood has been ascertained, the patient may be
prognosed, diagnosed, treated or the treatment may be altered.
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means a nontoxic material that does not
interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredient(s).
As used herein, the term "administering" in relation to a compound, e.g., serelaxin or a serelaxin
receptor agonist, is used to refer to delivery of that compound to a patient by any route.
As used herein, "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount of serelaxin or a serelaxin
agonist that is effective, upon single or multiple dose administration to a patient (such as a human)
for treating, preventing, preventing the onset of, curing, delaying, reducing the severity of,
ameliorating at least one symptom of a disorder or recurring disorder, or prolonging the survival of
the patient beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment. When applied to an individual
active ingredient (e.g., serelaxin), administered alone, the term refers to that ingredient alone.
When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that
result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously.
As used herein, the terms "treatment" and "treat" refer to both prophylactic or preventative
treatment (as the case may be) as well as curative or disease modifying treatment, including
treatment of a patient at risk of contracting the disease or suspected to have contracted the disease
as well as patients who are ill or have been diagnosed as suffering from a disease or medical
condition, and includes suppression of clinical relapse or exacerbation. The treatment may be
administered to a patient having a medical disorder or who ultimately may acquire the disorder, in
order to prevent, cure, delay the onset of, reduce the severity of, or ameliorate one or more
symptoms of a disorder or recurring disorder, or in order to prolong the survival of a patient beyond
that expected in the absence of such treatment.
As used herein, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the content
clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a protein" includes a mixture of two or

     WO 2015/189790                                                            PCT/IB2015/054399
                                                   9
more proteins, and reference to "the agent" includes reference to one or more agents and
equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.
It will be clear that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as particularly described in the
foregoing description and examples. Numerous modifications and variations of the present
invention are possible in light of the above teachings and, therefore, are within the scope of the
appended claims.
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed
description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.
Moreover, it must be understood that the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments
described, as such may, of course, vary. Further, the terminology used to describe particular
embodiments is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present invention will be limited
only by its claim.
Unless defined otherwise, the meanings of all technical and scientific terms used herein are those
commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. One of
ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that any methods and materials similar or equivalent to
those described herein can also be used to practice or test the invention.
Further, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, % purity, polypeptide
lengths, and so forth, used in the specification and claims, are modified by the term "about," unless
otherwise indicated. Accordingly, the numerical parameters set forth herein are approximations
that may vary depending upon the desired properties of the present invention. At the very least, and
not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims,
each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant
digits, applying ordinary rounding techniques.

The disclosed methods are useful for the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of heart failure,
particularly acute hear failure, as well as predicting the likelihood of cardia patient's response to
treatment with serelaxin. These methods employ, inter alia, determining whether a patient has
GDF-1 5 as a biomarker in a sample from the patient.
A biological sample from the patient may be assayed for the presence of GDF- 15 by any applicable
conventional means, which will be selected depending on the ease of acquiring a particular
biological sample.
Numerous biological samples may be used to identify the presence of GDF-15, e.g., blood, synovial
fluid, buffy coat, serum, plasma, lymph, feces, urine, tear, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, buccal swabs,
sputum, or tissue. Preferably, the biological sample comprises blood taken from a patient soon after
experiencing a cardiac episode or soon after experiencing symptoms associated with a cardiac
episode.
One inventive discovery of the present invention encompasses the determination that GDF-15 is
useful for predicting the pulmonary load of a particular individual, which allows for a medical
professional to proactively treat a potential cardiac episode such as acute heart failure.
Typically, once the presence of an AIR marker or polymorphism is determined, physicians or
patients or other researchers may be informed of the result. Specifically the result can be cast in a
transmittable form of information that can be communicated or transmitted to other researchers or
physicians or patients. Such a form can vary and can be tangible or intangible. The result in the
individual tested can be embodied in descriptive statements, diagrams, photographs, charts, images
or any other visual forms. For example, statements regarding the level of GDF-15 are useful in
indicating the testing results. These statements and visual forms can be recorded on a tangible
media such as papers, computer readable media such as floppy disks, compact disks, etc., or on an
intangible media, e.g., an electronic media in the form of email or website on internet or intranet.
In addition, the result can also be recorded in a sound form and transmitted through any suitable
media, e.g., analog or digital cable lines, fiber optic cables, etc., via telephone, facsimile, wireless
mobile phone, internet phone and the like. All such forms (tangible and intangible) would constitute

    WO 2015/189790                                                             PCT/IB2015/054399
                                                  11
a "transmittable form of information". Thus, the information and data on a test result can be
produced anywhere in the world and transmitted to a different location.
Methods of Treatment
The disclosed methods allow clinicians to provide a personalized therapy for treating pulmonary
load in patients, i.e., they allow determination of whether to selectively treat the patient with a
composition such as serelaxin. In this way, a clinician can maximize the benefit and minimize the
risk of a potentially fatal cardiac episode. It will be understood that serelaxin is useful for the
treatment or amelioration of acute heart failure.
 Patients are treated via a subcutaneous pump supplying pharmaceutically active serelaxin (e.g.,
synthetic, recombinant, analog, agonist, etc.) in an amount in a range of about I to 1000 ptg/kg of
subject body weight per day. In one embodiment, the dosages of serelaxin are 10, 30, 100 and 250
ptg/kg/day. These dosages result in serum concentrations of serelaxin of about 1, 3, 10, 30, 75 or
100 ng/ml. In one preferred embodiment, pharmaceutically effective serelaxin or an agonist thereof
is administered at about 30 ptg/kg/day. In another preferred embodiment, pharmaceutically
effective serelaxin or an agonist thereof is administered at about 10 to about 250 p.g/kg/day. In
another embodiment, the administration of serelaxin is continued as to maintain a serum
concentration of serelaxin of from about 0.5 to about 500 ng/ml, more preferably from about 0.5 to
about 300 ng/ml, and most preferably from about 1 to about 10 ng/ml. Most preferably, the
administration of serelaxin is continued as to maintain a serum concentration of serelaxin of 10
ng/ml or greater. These serelaxin concentrations can ameliorate or reduce the excessive dilute urine
production and accompanying complication associated with NDI. In a preferred embodiment the
serelaxin is serelaxin.
Serelaxin Compositions and Formulations
Serelaxin, serelaxin agonists and/or serelaxin analogs are formulated as pharmaceuticals to be used
in the methods of the disclosure. Any composition or compound that can stimulate a biological
response associated with the binding of biologically or pharmaceutically active serelaxin (e.g.,

synthetic serelaxin, recombinant serelaxin) or a serelaxin agonist (e.g., serelaxin analog or
serelaxin-like modulator) to serelaxin receptors can be used as a pharmaceutical in the disclosure.
General details on techniques for formulation and administration are well described in the scientific
literature (see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Maack Publishing Co, Easton Pa.).
Pharmaceutical formulations containing pharmaceutically active serelaxin can be prepared
according to any method known in the art for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. The
formulations containing pharmaceutically active serelaxin or serelaxin agonists used in the methods
of the disclosure can be formulated for administration in any conventionally acceptable way
including, but not limited to, intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, sublingually,
intranasally, intracerebrally, intracerebroventricularly, topically, orally, intravitrealy and via
inhalation. Illustrative examples are set forth below. In one preferred embodiment, serelaxin is
administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
When serelaxin is delivered by intravenous or subcutaneous injection (e.g., infusion, bolus, pump),
the formulations containing pharmaceutically active serelaxin or a pharmaceutically effective
serelaxin agonist can be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable
aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension can be formulated according to the known art
using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned
above. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a
nontoxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents
that can be employed are water and Ringer's solution, an isotonic sodium chloride. In addition,
sterile fixed oils can conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this
purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In
addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid can likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.
Aqueous suspensions of the disclosure contain serelaxin in admixture with excipients suitable for
the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as
sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate,
polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a
naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a

fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long
chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethylene oxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene
oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitol
mono-oleate), or a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from fatty
acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension
can also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or
more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as
sucrose, aspartame or saccharin. Formulations can be adjusted for osmolarity.
Oil suspensions can be formulated by suspending serelaxin in a vegetable oil, such as arachis oil,
olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oil suspensions
can contain a thickening agent, such as beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents
can be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These formulations can be preserved by the
addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid.
Dispersible powders and granules of the disclosure suitable for preparation of an aqueous
suspension by the addition of water can be formulated from serelaxin in admixture with a
dispersing, suspending and/or wetting agent, and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or
wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those disclosed above. Additional
excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, can also be present.
The pharmaceutical formulations of the disclosure can also be in the form of oil-in-water
emulsions. The oily phase can be a vegetable oil, such as olive oil or arachis oil, a mineral oil, such
as liquid paraffin, or a mixture of these. Suitable emulsifying agents include naturally-occurring
gums, such as gum acacia and gum tragacanth, naturally occurring phosphatides, such as soybean
lecithin, esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, such as sorbitan
mono-oleate, and condensation products of these partial esters with ethylene oxide, such as
polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate.

                                                  14
The formulations containing pharmaceutically active serelaxin or pharmaceutically effective
serelaxin agonist used in the methods of the disclosure can be administered in any conventionally
acceptable way including, but not limited to, intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly,
sublingually, intranasally, intracerebrally, intracerebroventricularly, topically, orally, intravitrealy
and via inhalation. Administration will vary with the pharmacokinetics and other properties of the
drugs and the patients' condition of health. General guidelines are presented below.
The state of the art allows the clinician to determine the dosage regimen of serelaxin for each
individual patient. As an illustrative example, the guidelines provided below for serelaxin can be
used as guidance to determine the dosage regimen, i.e., dose schedule and dosage levels, of
formulations containing pharmaceutically active serelaxin administered when practicing the
methods of the disclosure. As a general guideline, it is expected that the daily dose of
pharmaceutically active HI, H2 and/or H3 human serelaxin (e.g., synthetic, recombinant, analog,
agonist, etc.) is typically in an amount in a range of about 1 to 1000 ptg/kg of subject body weight
per day. In one embodiment, the dosages of serelaxin are 10, 30, 100 and 250 p.g/kg/day. In
another embodiment, these dosages result in serum concentrations of serelaxin of about 1, 3, 10, 30,
75 or 100 ng/ml. In one preferred embodiment, pharmaceutically effective serelaxin or an agonist
thereof is administered at about 30 ptg/kg/day. In another preferred embodiment, pharmaceutically
effective serelaxin or an agonist thereof is administered at about 10 to about 250 p.g/kg/day. In
another embodiment, the administration of serelaxin is continued as to maintain a serum
concentration of serelaxin of from about 0.5 to about 500 ng/ml, more preferably from about 0.5 to
about 300 ng/ml, and most preferably from about 1 to about 10 ng/ml. Most preferably, the
administration of serelaxin is continued as to maintain a serum concentration of serelaxin of 10
ng/ml or greater. Thus, the methods of the present disclosure include administrations that result in
these serum concentrations of serelaxin. These serelaxin concentrations can ameliorate or reduce
fluid accumulation associated with edema, including, but not limited to cerebral edema, ocular
edema, pulmonary edema, ascites, hereditary angioedema, peripheral edema, and systemic edema.
Furthermore, these serelaxin concentrations can ameliorate or reduce chronic excretion of dilute
urine in NDI. Depending on the subject, the serelaxin administration is maintained for as specific
period of time or for as long as needed to achieve stability in the subject. For example, the duration

    WO 2015/189790                                                             PCT/IB2015/054399
                                                  15
of serelaxin treatment is preferably kept at a range of about 4 hours to about 96 hours, more
preferably 8 hours to about 72 hours, depending on the patient, and one or more optional repeat
treatments as needed.
Single or multiple administrations of serelaxin formulations may be administered depending on the
dosage and frequency as required and tolerated by the patient who suffers from edema and/or NDI.
The formulations should provide a sufficient quantity of serelaxin to effectively ameliorate the
condition. A typical pharmaceutical formulation for intravenous subcutaneous administration of
serelaxin would depend on the specific therapy. For example, serelaxin may be administered to a
patient through monotherapy (i.e., with no other concomitant medications) or in combination
therapy with another medication. In one embodiment, serelaxin is administered to a patient daily as
monotherapy. In another embodiment, serelaxin is administered to a patient daily as combination
therapy with another drug. Notably, the dosages and frequencies of serelaxin administered to a
patient may vary depending on age, degree of illness, drug tolerance, and concomitant medications
and conditions.

description above. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described
herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, the preferred methods and
materials are now described. Other features, objects, and advantages of the disclosure will be
apparent from the description and from the claims. In the specification and the appended claims,

Example 1: Effect of Serelaxin on GDF-15 Levels in Patients with Acute Heart Failure

    WO 2015/189790                                                             PCT/IB2015/054399
                                                 16
In an international, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Teerlink et al., Lancet 381:29-39 (2013))
the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference, patients displaying pulmonary
congestion on chest radiograph and admitted to the hospital for acute heart failure were randomized
to a 48 hour intravenous infusion of placebo or 30 ug/kg/d serelaxin. Time elapsed from arrival to
the hospital to the intravenous administration of serelaxin was less than nine hours. Serelaxin
significantly improved the primary dyspnea efficacy endpoint as evaluated by the Visual Acuity
Scale area under the curve (p=0.007) and patients reported improvements in general well-being.
The average length of hospital stay was significantly reduced in the serelaxin treated group by 0.9
days (p=0.04) and time in the intensive care or coronary care unit was reduced by 0.4 days
(p=0.03). The 48 hour infusion of serelaxin reduced cardiovascular death at 180 days (p=0.28). No
previous intervention outcome trial in patients with acute heart failure has shown a beneficial effect
on post discharge mortality.
Blood samples for biomarker analysis were collected in serum separating tubes prior to initiation of
serelaxin or placebo (baseline) and at days 2, 5, 14, and 60. The serum samples were centrifuged
within 30 to 60 minutes of collection following visualization of a clot, frozen at -20'C for up to
four weeks, then sent on dry ice to a central laboratory for storage at -80'C until the analysis was
performed. GDF-15 was measured in the samples using a pre-commercial electrochemiluminescent
immunoassay provided by Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). All samples from the
same patient were analyzed at the same time at a certified central laboratory by personnel blinded to
patient treatment and study data. The reporting range for GDF-15 was 400 to 20,000 ng/L.
Changes in patient-reported dyspnea were assessed through day 5 as the area under the change from
baseline in visual analog scale score through day 5, where the worst possible score was assigned
following death or worsening heart failure (dyspnea VAS AUC). Reasons for rehospitalizations
through day 60 and causes of deaths through day 180 were adjudicated centrally by a blinded
endpoint committee.
Multivariable linear regression models were developed for the changes in GDF- 15 levels from
baseline to days 2 and 14 using baseline patient clinical characteristics and routine laboratory
measures; backwards elimination in the placebo group was used, with p<O.10 as the criterion for

retention in the model. Missing predictors were imputed with the treatment-group-specific median
for continuous variables and mode for categorical variables. GDF- 15 values were log-transformed.
The linearity of associations was assessed using restricted cubic splines, and if significant non
linearity was found (at p<O.10), a dichotomized, trichotomized, linear spline or quadratic or cubic
polynomial transformation was chosen based on the univariable Akaike's Information Criterion.
Adjusted R2 values from 5-fold cross-validations are presented. The serelaxin effect on biomarker
changes was then estimated in all patients with multivariable adjustment for covariates prognostic
of these changes in the placebo group.

At days 2 and 5, GDF- 15 levels were significantly lower in acute heart failure patients treated with
serelaxin in addition to the standard of care than in those treated with placebo in addition to
standard of care. At day 14, GDF- 15 levels approached statistical significance.

Changes in GDF- 15 at day 2 and day 14 were associated with adverse outcomes in acute heart
failure patients. Hospital readmission for heart failure or renal failure, cardiovascular death at day
60 and cardiovascular death at day 180 were strongly and independently associated with the change
observed in GDF- 15 levels at days 2 and 14 post-serelaxin treatment, as shown in Table 3.
Increases in GDF- 15 from baseline to day 2 and to day 14 were highly significant predictors of
these negative outcomes.

  A multivariate analysis of the data demonstrated that the baseline level of GDF- 15 was not
associated with increased rates of hospital readmission for heart failure or renal failure; nor was it
associated with cardiovascular death through day 60 or day 180. The changes in GDF-15 from
baseline to day 2 and to day 14 were highly significant predictors of these outcomes. Serelaxin
treatment was associated with a faster decrease in GDF- 15 to day 14 and a trend towards lower

GDF-15 at day 60. A multivariate analysis of 180 day cardiovascular mortality that incorporates
both serelaxin treatment and changes in GDF- 15 to day 2, as shown in Table 4, demonstrate that the
decrease in GSF-1 5 is partially responsible for the previous observation that serelaxin treatment
decreased mortality in patients with acute heart failure. Inclusion of the GDF-15 change to day 14
in a multivariable model of 180-day CV mortality reduced the estimated serelaxin hazard ratio to
0.753, while the effect of the GDF-15 change remained highly significant, suggesting that the
change in GDF-15 may mediate the association of serelaxin treatment with decreased 180-day
mortality.

Example 2: Effect of Serelaxin on GDF-15 and Pulmonary Hemodynamics in Patients with
Acute Heart Failure
In a separate study, the pulmonary hemodynamic effects (e.g., the pulomonary load) of serelaxin
were evaluated in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure (Ponikowski et al., Eur Heart J
35:431-441 (2014)). Patients were randomized 1:1 to serelaxin or placebo, initially stabilized, then
infused with serelaxin at a dose of 30 ug/kg/d for 20 hours. Pulmonary congestion at the time of
presentation was a required inclusion criterion. Time elapsed from hospital admission to the
beginning of intravenous infusion of serelaxin was less than 29 hours. Serelaxin exerted rapid
hemodynamic effects; changes were detected within the first 30 minutes of infusion and were
sustained throughout the treatment period. Serelaxin reduced the time weighted average pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure from baseline in the first eight hours of treatment (p=O.0001) as well as
during hours 8-20 (p=0.03). Serelaxin significantly lowered both systolic and diastolic pulmonary
arterial pressure (p=0001 at four hours) with a concomitant decrease in systemic vascular resistance
and pulmonary vascular resistance.
GDF-15 was measured in blood samples collected in serum separating tubes. The serum samples
were centrifuged within two hours and plasma was stored at -20'C or lower, followed by storage at
-80'C until the analysis was performed. GDF-1 5 was measured using a pre-commercial
electrochemiluminescent immunoassay provided by Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim,
Germany). All samples from the same patient were analyzed at the same time at a certified central
laboratory by personnel blinded to patient treatment and study data.
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), and
pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) were measured as well as NTproBNP and GDF-1 5. An
analysis was performed of the association of GDF-15 and NTproBNP with these hemodynamic
indices.
As with example 1, above, the GDF-15 levels were significantly decreased by serelaxin versus
placebo (baseline median 3262 and 3192 ng/ml, respectively and shown in FIG. 1). As shown in
FIG. 1, the geo-mean was reduced from baseline by 16%, while the placebo showed an increase of

    WO 2015/189790                                                              PCT/IB2015/054399
                                                  25
3% from baseline. This resulted in a treatment difference of 18% in favor of serelaxin (p=0.0204).
In addition, over the 20 hour infusion period, improvements in Pulmonary Capillary Wedge
Pressure (PCWP), mean Pulmonary Artery Pressure (PAP), and Pulmonary Vascular Resistance
(PVR) were measured as well as NTproBNP and GDF-15. An analysis was performed of the
association of GDF-15 and NTproBNP with these hemodynamic indices.
Over the 20 hour infusion period, improvements in PCWP, PAP and PVR favored serelaxin
compared to placebo (all p values <0.005). NTproBNP was also significantly reduced by serelaxin
(p=0.037).
GDF-15 levels at baseline and 20 hours were significantly associated with PAP (FIGs. 2A-B,
p<0.025), PVR (FIGS. 3A-B, p< 0.001) and NTproBNP (FIGS. 4A-B, p<0.001). GDF-15 levels
were significantly associated with PCWP at 20 hours but not baseline (p<O.02; p=O.7). The
association of NTproBNP levels at baseline and 20 hours was not statistically significant for PAP,
PVR, or PCWP.
This example shows that not only did serelaxin reduce GDF- 15 levels, but that additionally
serelaxin had favorable effects on pulmonary hemodynamics and significantly reduced NTproBNP
and GDF-15. GDF-15 levels at baseline and 20 hours were significantly associated with
NTproBNP and several pulmonary hemodynamic indices. In contrast, NTproBNP was not
significantly associated with the pulmonary indices at baseline or 20 hours. Thus, GDF-15 at
baseline as well as reductions in GDF-15 over time, are more useful than NTproBNP for predicting
pulmonary load.
Overall then, the inventors have surprisingly discovered that the levels of GDF-1 5 at baseline, and
for a period of up to 14 days thereafter can be used to predict a patient's pulmonary load. This in
turn, allows for the prediction of a potential cardiac event, as it is well known that an increased
pulmonary load can lead to a cardiac event. As a result, a healthcare provider can act accordingly
and administer a GDF-1 5 lowering composition such as serelaxin.

                                                   26
Multivariable linear regression models were developed for the changes in biomarker levels from
baseline to day 2 and 14 using baseline patient clinical characteristics and routine laboratory
measures; backwards elimination in the placebo group was used, with p<O.10 as the criterion for
retention in the model. Missing predictors were imputed with the treatment-group-specific median
for continuous variables and mode for categorical variables. GDF-15 values were log-transformed.
To allow consistency and comparability of models with and without biomarkers, missing follow-up
biomarker levels were imputed using linear interpolation or as last observation carried forward if no
following measure was available. The linearity of associations was assessed using restricted cubic
splines, and if significant non-linearity was found (at p<O.10), a dichotomized, trichotomized, linear
spline or quadratic or cubic polynomial transformation was chosen based on the univariable
Akaike's Information Criterion. The serelaxin effect on GDF- 15 changes was then estimated with
multivariable adjustment for covariates prognostic of these changes in the placebo group. The
results are set forth in Tables 5 and 6 below.
Associations of baseline biomarker values and changes with clinical outcomes were estimated with
linear regression for dyspnea VAS AUC, and with Cox regression models for 60-day
rehospitalization for heart failure or renal failure or cardiovascular death and for 180-day
cardiovascular mortality. Linearity of associations of GDF-15 values with outcomes was assessed
as above. Mean changes in biomarkers over time were estimated from repeated measures analysis
of variance models, with no imputation for missing values.

[1] Patients who died or were censored on or before day 14 were excluded (N=1037)
As shown above, serelaxin was associated with a greater decreases in GDF-15 that were statistically
significant at days 2 and 5 with a trend for a significant difference at day 14 (p=0.0534), although
this was reduced after adjustment for baseline characteristics. The effect of serelaxin on GDF- 15
appears to be of special importance. Although GDF- 15 levels have been reported to be decreased
following LVAD implantation and cardiac unloading in end-stage HF, serelaxin appears to be the
first drug therapy shown to reduce GDF-15 in patients with cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin
receptor blocker therapy did not reduce GDF- 15 in CHF and intensive statin therapy had no effect
on GDF-15 in other clinical trials.

What is claimed is:
1.      A method of selectively treating a patient having pulmonary congestion, comprising:
        assessing the pulmonary load in a patient with pulmonary congestion; and
        thereafter administering a therapeutically effective amount of serelaxin to the patient.
2.      The method according to claim 1, wherein said assessing comprises assaying a biological
sample from the patient for the presence or absence of GDF- 15.
3.      The method according to any of the previous claims, wherein serelaxin is administered to
maintain a serum concentration of 1 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml in the patient.
4.      The method of any of the previous claims, wherein serelaxin is administered to maintain a
serum concentration of 1Ong/ml in the patient.
5.      The method of any of the previous claims, wherein serelaxin is administered subcutaneously
at an infusion rate of 3 pg/kg/day to 150 pg/kg/day.
6.      The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein serelaxin is administered
subcutaneously at an infusion rate of 30 gg/kg/day.
7. The method of any of the previous claims wherein serelaxin is administered continuously for at
least 24 hours.
8.      A method of selectively reducing the pulmonary load of a patient comprising:
        obtaining a biological sample from a patient;
        measuring the amount of GDF- 15 in the biological sample; and

       thereafter administering a therapeutically affective amount of serelaxin in response to an
elevated level of GDF- 15.
9.      The method according to claim 8, wherein serelaxin is administered to maintain a serum
concentration of 1 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml in the patient.
10.     The method of any of claim 8-9, wherein serelaxin is administered to maintain a serum
concentration of 1Ong/ml in the patient.
11.     The method of any of claims 8-10, wherein serelaxin is administered subcutaneously at an
infusion rate of 3 pig/kg/day to 150 ptg/kg/day.
12.     The method of any of claims 8-11, wherein serelaxin is administered subcutaneously at an
infusion rate of 30 pig/kg/day.
13. The method of any of claims 8-12 wherein serelaxin is administered continuously for at least
24 hours.
14.    A method of determining the prognosis of mortality of a patient with heart failure
comprising:
        obtaining a first biological sample from a patient;
        detecting the level of GDF-15 in the first biological sample;
       administering a therapeutically effective amount of serelaxin;
        obtaining a second biological sample from the patient after administration of serelxain;
        detecting the level of GDF- 15 in the second biological sample;
        comparing the level of GDF- 15 in the first biological sample to the second biological
sample; and
       predicting the probability of survival.
