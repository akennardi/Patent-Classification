Abstract
A trampoline 10 comprises a base mat section 20 and an angled second mat section 30 which
extends from one side edge of the base mat section 20. The trampoline 10 is a portable
trampoline, typically for use in the home backyard. The base section 20 in the embodiment
comprises a rectangular perimeter base frame 21 which supports a rectangular base mat 22.
The base frame 21 is then supported to the ground via legs 24. The base section 20 thus
provides a horizontal primary bounce area 25. The trampoline 10 comprises an angled
secondary bounce area 35 which is provided by the angled mat section 30. The angled mat
section 30 is essentially a second trampoline area which is mounted adjacent to and at an
angle relative to the base mat section 20. The angled secondary bounce area 35 faces and
is generally directed towards the horizontal primary bounce area 25. The angled secondary
bounce area 35 is at an angle of between 45 degrees to 70 degrees relative to the horizontal
primary bounce area 25.

Brief Description of the Drawings
[17]     Notwithstanding any other forms which may fall within the scope of the present
invention, preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of
examples only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:
[18]     Figure 1 is a side perspective view of a trampoline with an angled side panel in
accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention;
[19]     Figure 2 is an internal front view of the trampoline of Figure 1; and
[20]     Figures 3 to 6 show the steps in forming the base mat section and angled mat section
of the trampoline of Figure 1.
Description of Embodiments
[21]     It should be noted in the following description that like or the same reference numerals
in different embodiments denote the same or similar features.
[22]     Figures 1 and 2 show a trampoline 10 according to a preferred embodiment of the
present invention. The trampoline 10 comprises a base mat section 20 and an angled second
mat section 30 which extends from one side edge of the base mat section 20. The trampoline
10 is a portable trampoline, typically for use in the home backyard.
[23]     The base section 20 in the embodiment comprises a rectangular perimeter base frame
21 which supports a rectangular base mat 22. As per typical trampoline construction, the base
mat 22 is mounted to the first base frame 21 via elastic means such as springs, rubber bands,
or other form of elastic members. The base frame 21 is then supported to the ground via legs
24. The base section 20 thus provides a horizontal primary bounce area 25.
[24]     The trampoline 10 comprises an angled secondary bounce area 35 which is provided
by the angled mat section 30. The angled mat section 30 is essentially a second trampoline
area which is mounted adjacent to and at an angle relative to the base mat section 20. The
angled secondary bounce area 35 faces and is generally directed towards the horizontal
primary bounce area 25. The angled secondary bounce area 35 is at an angle of between 45
degrees to 70 degrees relative to the horizontal primary bounce area 25.
[25]     The angled mat section 30 similarly comprises a rectangular perimeter second frame
31 which supports a rectangular second mat 32. The second mat 22 is also supported to the

                                                3
second frame 31 via elastic members. One side edge 36 of the angled mat section 30 is
disposed adjacent to and co-extensive with a side edge 26 of the base mat section 20.
[26]    The base mat section 20 and the angled mat section 30 are of similar width, with the
sections 20 and 30 substantially sharing a common edge.         The angled mat section 30 is
pivotably or hingedly supported to the base mat section 20 at the common edges thereof. The
other sections of the angled mat section 30 are then supported to the ground via secondary
supports 40.
[27]    The trampoline 10 additionally comprises perimeter safety netting 50 supported via
poles 52 which are mounted to the legs 24 and the secondary supports 40. An additional top
netting 55 is mounted above the angled mat section 30.
[28]    In use, users of the trampoline 10 are able to bounce on the horizontal primary bounce
area 25 as well as the angled secondary bounce area 35. This allows users to perform
additional moves on the angled secondary bounce area 35 and land on the horizontal primary
bounce area 25, which are not available with traditional trampolines.
[29]    Figures 3 to 6 show the steps in forming the base mat section 20 and angled mat
section 30 of the trampoline 10.
[30]    Figure 3 shows forming of the base mat section 20 in a similar manner to typical
trampolines. The components of the rectangular perimeter base frame 21 are initially formed,
and the base frame 21 is then supported via the legs 24. The base mat 22 is then mounted
to the base frame 21 via elastic members 27.
[31]    As shown in Figures 4 and 5, one edge 26 of the base frame 21 comprises pivotable
mounts 29 for an edge 36 of the angled mat section 30. In the embodiment, the pivotable
mounts comprise tubular members through which the frame component of the edge 36 can
extend through. As per the base mat section 20, the components of the rectangular perimeter
second frame 21 are formed, and the second mat 32 is then mounted to the second frame 31
via elastic members 27 prior to the angled mat section 30 being fully supported by the
secondary supports 40.
[32]    The secondary supports 40 comprises a horizontal extension frame 60 extending from
the base frame 21, and a vertical side frame 62 supported on the ground and by the extension
frame 60. The side frame 62 extends upwardly and supports the upper edge 28 of the angled
mat section 30.     The secondary supports 40 further comprise an intermediate frame 64
supporting a mid-section of the angled mat section 30, as well as curved members 66
additionally supporting the upper portions of the angled mat section 30, both the frame 64 and
the members 66 extending from the vertical side frame 62.

                                               4
[33]    Perimeter padding 39 to cover the elastic members 27, support poles 52 and the
perimeter safety netting 50 are then added to the trampoline 10.
[34]    Whilst preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described, it will be
apparent to skilled persons that modifications can be made to the embodiments described.
For example, the orientation angle of the angled mat section relative to the base mat section
can be made adjustable. Also, the base mat section can be made angled or adjustable to an
angled orientation (from horizontal) such that the trampoline has two angled sections.
[35]    The trampoline can also me made with two or more sides angled mat sections, for
example one angled mat section extending from each of opposite sides of the base mat
section. The trampoline can also be made with three or four side angled mat sections
extending from the base mat section.
[36]    The invention can also be used for other shaped trampolines such as circular base
mats.
[37]    Figure 7 shows a modified embodiment which includes angled reinforcement frame 71
for the vertical side frame 62.
