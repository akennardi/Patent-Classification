                                            BACKGROUND
           Integrins are a superfamily of cell surface receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell
   matrix adhesion. These heterodimeric proteins, composed of two noncovalently linked
   polypeptide chains, a and   P, provide anchorage as well as signals for cellular growth, migration
15 and differentiation during development and tissue repair. Integrins have also been implicated in
   immune and inflammatory processes, which require the extravasation of cells out of blood
   vessels, into tissues and towards the site of infection.
           VLA- I (also called a 1P 1) belongs to a class of integrins called VLA ("Very Late
   Antigen") integrins. VLA-1 binds collagen (both types I and IV) and laminin, and has been
20 implicated in cell adhesion and migration on collagen; contraction and reorganization of
   collagen matrices; and regulation of expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix
   remodeling.
           VLA- 1 has been shown to be involved in the development of rheumatoid arthritis, a
   chronic inflammatory disease associated with bone resorption. Infiltrating T cells in the arthritic
25 synovium of patients express high levels of VLA-1, and its blockade with antibodies
   significantly reduces the inflammatory response and the development of arthritis in animal
   models.
                                                      1

                                            SUMMARY
           The invention is based, at least in part, on the development of formulations
   containing high concentrations of anti-VLA-1 antibody. Some embodiments are
   particularly well suitable for delivery to a subject, such as a human, for example, a human
 5 patient, by subcutaneous (SC) delivery. The anti-VLA-1 antibody can be SAN-300, for
   example, and the antibody is at a concentration of about > 100 mg/mL to about
   225 mg/mL. The formulations provide a therapeutic effect for an inflammatory, immune,
   or autoimmune disorder. For example, the formulation can provide a therapeutic effect
   for an inflammatory disorder, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

30 or phosphate buffer. The buffer can be at a concentration of about 10 mM to about
   50 mM, for example, about 20 mM to about 40 mM, such as about 30 mM. For example,
                                                  2

   the composition can contain a histidine buffer at a concentration of about 10 mM to about
   50 mM, for example, about 20 mM to about 40 mM, such as about 30 mM. In one

   about 240 mM to about 260 mM.
           In another embodiment, the aqueous pharmaceutical composition further
25 comprises a surfactant, such as a polysorbate, for example, polysorbate 80 or
   polysorbate 20. In one embodiment, the concentration of surfactant is at a concentration

   to about 0.05%, such as about 0.01%.
           As used herein, a "surfactant" is a substance that lowers surface tension of a
30 liquid, and are used to prevent surface adsorption and act as stabilizers against protein
   aggregation. Exemplary surfactants suitable for use herein include, for example,
                                                 3

            In another embodiment, the anti-VLA- 1 antibody is a humanized monoclonal
15 antibody, such as SAN-300. In another embodiment, the anti-VLA-1 antibody is a
   variant of SAN-300. For example, in some embodiments, the light chain variable region
   of the antibody has an amino acid sequence that differs by one or more amino acid
   residues, but not more than 2 amino acid residues, 3 amino acid residues, 4 amino acid
   residues, 5 amino acid residues, or 6 amino acid residues of the light chain variable
20 region of SAN-300, and/or the heavy chain variable region has an amino acid sequence
   that differs by one or more amino acid residues, but not more than 2 amino acid residues,
   3 amino acid residues, 4 amino acid residues, 5 amino acid residues, or 6 amino acid
   residues of the heavy chain variable region of SAN-300. In some embodiments, some or

25          In another embodiment, the anti-VLA- 1 antibody has one or both of a light chain
   variable region having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4 (FIG. 2A), and a heavy
   chain variable region having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 (FIG. 2B). In
   other embodiments, the anti-VLA- 1 antibody is a variant of one of these antibodies. For
   example, in some embodiments, the light chain variable region has an amino acid
30 sequence that differs by one or more amino acid residues, but not more than 2 amino acid
   residues, 3 amino acid residues, 4 amino acid residues, 5 amino acid residues, 6 amino
                                               5

   acid residues, 7 amino acid residues, 8 amino acid residues, 9 amino acid residues or 10
   amino acid residues from the sequence in SEQ ID NO:4, and/or the heavy chain variable
   region has an amino acid sequence that differs by one or more amino acid residues, but
   not more than 2 amino acid residues, 3 amino acid residues, 4 amino acid residues, 5
 5 amino acid residues, 6 amino acid residues, 7 amino acid residues, 8 amino acid residues,
   9 amino acid residues or 10 amino acid residues as defined by SEQ ID NO:5. In other
   embodiments, the light chain variable region has an amino acid sequence that is 80%,
   85%, 90% or 95% identical with the sequence of SEQ ID NO:4, and/or the heavy chain
   variable region has an amino acid sequence that is 80%, 85%, 90% or 95% identical with
10 the sequence of SEQ ID NO:5.
           In yet another embodiment, the anti-VLA- 1 antibody has one or both of a light
   chain amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 (FIG. 3), and a heavy chain amino acid
   sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 (FIG. 4). In other embodiments, the VLA-1 antibody is a
   variant of one of these antibodies. For example, in some embodiments, the light chain of
15 the antibody has an amino acid sequence that differs by one or more amino acid residues,
   but not more than 2 amino acid residues, 3 amino acid residues, 4 amino acid residues, 5
   amino acid residues, 6 amino acid residues, 7 amino acid residues, 8 amino acid residues,
   9 amino acid residues or 10 amino acid residues from the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1,
   and/or the heavy chain of the antibody has an amino acid sequence that differs by one or
20 more amino acid residues, but not more than 2 amino acid residues, 3 amino acid
   residues, 4 amino acid residues, 5 amino acid residues, 6 amino acid residues, 7 amino
   acid residues, 8 amino acid residues, 9 amino acid residues or 10 amino acid residues
   from the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2. In other embodiments, the light chain of the
   antibody has an amino acid sequence that is 80%, 85%, 90% or 95% identical with the
25 sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, and/or the heavy chain of the antibody has an amino acid
   sequence that 80%, 85%, 90% or 95% identical with the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2.
           A first amino acid sequence "differs" or is "different" or displays a "difference" as
   compared to a second amino acid sequence when there is a difference in the identity of an
30 amino acid (for example, a substitution of a different amino acid for an amino acid in
   SEQ ID NO:4 or 5 referred to above), or a deletion or insertion. A difference can be, for
                                                6

   example, in a framework region, a CDR, a hinge, or a constant region. A difference can
   be internal or at the end of a sequence of protein. In some embodiments, some or all
   differences are conservative changes as compared to the recited sequence.
 5           In another embodiment, the composition comprises less than 20 mM citrate, and
   in another embodiment the composition is substantially free of citrate. For example, the
   level of citrate comprises less than 20 mM citrate, or the level of citrate is such that it has
   no effect on a property described herein, such as, injection site pain when embodiments
   are administered to a subject.
10
            In another embodiment, the aqueous pharmaceutical composition comprising an
   anti-VLA-1 antibody is stable for at least 6 months, at least 12 months, at least 18
   months, at least 24 months, at least 30 months, or at least 36 months or longer (for
   example, at least 1 year, at least 2 years, at least 3 years or longer). For example, the
15 composition can be stable for at least 6 months, at least 12 months, at least 18 months, at
   least 24 months, at least 30 months, at least 36 months or longer (for example, at least 1
   year, at least 2 years, at least 3 years, or longer), at a temperature of about 2 'C to about 8
   'C (for example, about 4 'C, about 5 C). In one embodiment, the composition is stable
   for at least 24 months (at least 2 years) at a temperature of about 2 'C to about 8 'C. In
20 another embodiment, the composition is stable for at least 2 days, at least 3 days, at least
   4 days, at least 5 days, at least 6 days, or at least 7 days or longer (for example, at least
   one week, or at least 12 days or at least 14 days or longer) at ambient temperature (about
   20 'C to about 30 'C, such as about 25 C).
            In one embodiment, less than about 1%, less than about 2%, less than about 5%,
25 less than about 10%, or less than about 15% of the antibody in the anti-VLA-1 antibody
   composition has aggregated after a period of 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24
   months, 30 months, or 36 months or longer, such as after a period of 1 year, 2 years or 3
   years or longer. In another embodiment, less than about 1%, less than about 2%, less
   than about 5%, less than about 10%, or less than about 15% of the antibody in the anti
30 VLA-1 antibody composition has fragmented after a period of 6 months, 12 months, 18
                                                   7

   months, 24 months, 30 months, or 36 months or longer, such as after a period of 1 year,
   2 years, 3 years or longer.
            In certain embodiments, aggregation or protein fragmentation is measured by
   dynamic light scattering (DLS), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), color/clarity, UV
 5 light scattering or size exclusion chromatography. In one embodiment, aggregation is
   measured by DLS. DLS can be performed by methods known those of ordinary skill in
   the art such as those described, for example, in Nobbmann et al., "Dynamic Light
   Scattering as a Relative Tool for Assessing the Molecular Integrity and Stability of
   Monoclonal Antibodies" Biotech. and Genetic Engineering Rev. 24:117-128, 2007. In
10 another embodiment, aggregation is measured by SEC. SEC can be performed by
   methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art such as those described, for example,
   in Skoog, D. A.; Principles of Instrumental Analysis, 6th ed.; Thompson Brooks/Cole:
   Belmont, CA, 2006, Chapter 28.
            In one embodiment, less than about 1%, less than about 2%, less than about 5%,
15 less than about 10%, less than about 15% or less than about 20% of the antibody in the
   aqueous pharmaceutical composition has undergone fragmentation after a period of
   6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, or 36 months or longer (for
   example, after a period of 1 year, 2 years, 3 years or longer).
            In one embodiment, less than about 1%, less than about 2%, less than about 5%,
20 less than about 10%, less than about 15% or less than about 20% of the antibody in the
   aqueous pharmaceutical composition has undergone deamidation after a period of
   6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, or 36 months or longer (for
   example, after a period of 1 year, 2 years, 3 years or longer). In another embodiment,
   deamidation is assayed by measuring protein loss, such as by spectroscopy, for example,
25 UV-Vis ("Ultraviolet-visible") spectroscopy. Use of UV-Vis spectroscopy is reviewed in,
   for example, Schmid, "Biological Macromolecules: UV-visible spectrophotometry"
   Encyclopedia of Life Sciences, pp. 1-4, published online April 19, 2001.
            In one embodiment, anti-VLA- 1 antibody in the aqueous pharmaceutical
   composition exhibits less than a preselected level of aggregation when the formulation is
30 stored in a closed container at about 2 'C to about 8 'C, such as at about 4 'C, for a
   preselected period of time, such as after storage for at least 30 days, at least 60 days, at
                                                 8

   least 90 days, at least 180 days, at least 1 year, at least 1.5 years, at least 2 years, at least
   2.5 years, at least 3 years or longer. In another embodiment, anti-VLA-1 antibody in the
   aqueous pharmaceutical composition exhibits less than a preselected level of protein loss
   due to aggregation when the formulation is stored in a closed container at about 2 'C to
 5 about 8 'C, for example, at about 4 'C, for a preselected period of time. In one
   embodiment, the preselected level of protein loss is less than about 40%, less than about
   35%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about
   10%, less than about 8%, less than about 5%, less than about 3%, less than about 1%, or
   less than about 0.5%. In one embodiment, after 6 months, one year, two years or three
10 years, less than about 1%, less than about 2%, less than about 5%, less than about 10%,
   less than about 15%, less than about 20%, less than about 30%, less than about 35%, or
   less than about 40% of the antibody in the formulation has undergone aggregation.
            Protein loss can be measured, for example, by spectroscopy, such as by UV-Vis
   spectroscopy. In certain embodiments, aggregation is measured by dynamic light
15 scattering (DLS), color/clarity, UV light scattering or size exclusion chromatography.
            In another embodiment, anti-VLA- 1 antibody in the aqueous pharmaceutical
   composition exhibits less than a preselected level of protein loss when the formulation is
   subjected to a preselected number of freeze/thaw cycles, for example, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or
   more freeze/thaw cycles. In one embodiment, the preselected number of freeze/thaw
20 cycles is 5. A "freeze/thaw cycle" is a sequence comprising at least one period in which
   the sample is a frozen solid followed by a period in which the samples is a liquid, or a
   sequence comprising at least one period in which the sample is liquid followed by a
   period in which the samples is a frozen solid. The periods can be equal to, or longer than,
   for example, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes,
25 60 minutes, or 120 minutes, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, or
   3 days, 5 days, 10 days, or 20 days in length. The liquid and solid periods need not be of
   the same length. The solid periods can be held at 0 'C or less, for example, -10 'C,
   -20 C, -30 C, -40 C, -60 C, or -80 C. The solid period can be at least, for example,

   again, to begin another freez/thaw cycle. The sample can be stored in the frozen state or
   in the melted state between freeze/thaw cycles. In one embodiment, the preselected level

20 rpm, or faster, for a preselected period of time, such as for 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5
   days or longer (for example, for 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 120 hours or
   longer at room temperature. In one embodiment, the preselected level of protein loss is

30 subjected to a preselected level of oxidation stress. The preselected level of oxidation
   stress can be provided by the presence of hydrogen peroxide at a final concentration of
                                                  10

   0.04% (v/v) with incubation at 37 'C for a preselected period of time, such as for 2 hours,

   deamidation can be provided by raising the pH of the composition, such as to a pH >9,
10 such as in the presence of Tris (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) buffer, and then
   incubating the composition at about 25 'C for a preselected period of time, such as for
   2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days or longer. In one embodiment, the preselected level

           In one embodiment, the aqueous pharmaceutical composition comprising an
   anti-VLA-1 antibody formulation is for subcutaneous (SC) administration.
           In one embodiment, the aqueous pharmaceutical composition has a syringeability
20 for patient self administration to a subcutaneous site. For example, the aqueous
   composition, when disposed in a syringe suitable for subcutaneous delivery can be
   expelled and thereby injected into a subcutaneous site of the patient, using pressure
   sufficient to depress the plunger for patient self administration. The pressure, or "plunger
   force" can be, for example, equal to or less than 4 lbs. In one embodiment, the plunger
25 force will allow delivery of a unit dosage in 10 seconds or less. In another embodiment,
   about 1 mL of an aqueous pharmaceutical composition, disposed in a syringe having a
   needle of a preselected gauge, can be expelled at a preselected rate with a plunger force
   of no more than a preselected amount. In another embodiment, about 2 mL of aqueous
   pharmaceutical composition, disposed in a syringe having a needle of a preselected
30 gauge, can be expelled at a preselected rate with a plunger force of no more than a
   preselected amount. For example, about 1 mL aqueous pharmaceutical composition,
                                                 11

   disposed in a syringe having a 25 gauge needle, a 27 guage needle, or a 30 guage needle
   can be expelled at 10 mL/minute with a plunger force of no more than 4 lbs.
           As used herein, a "unit dosage" is an amount suitable for administration at one
 5 time. The unit dosage can provide a therapeutically effective amount of anti-VLA- 1
   antibody, for example an amount of anti-VLA- 1 antibody to relieve one or more
   symptoms of an inflammatory disorder, such as one or more symptoms of arthritis or
   IBD.
           In one embodiment, the aqueous pharmaceutical composition comprising an
10 anti-VLA- 1 antibody has a viscosity suitable for subcutaneous delivery with a syringe,
   such as a viscosity of less than 21 cP (centipoises), less than 18 cP, less than 15 cP, less
   than 14 cP, such as at 3 rpm, 5 rpm, 7 rpm, or 9 rpm. In one embodiment, the
   composition has a viscosity of about 10 cP to about 20 cP, about 10 cP to about 15 cP,
   about 10 cP to about 14 cP, or for example, 10 cP to 13 cP, at for example 3 rpm, 5 rpm, 7
15 rpm, or 9 rpm.
           "Viscosity" is a measure of the resistance of a fluid that is being deformed by
   either shear or tensile stress. A thicker substance has higher resistance, and thus higher
   viscosity, than a thinner substance.

20 by a healthcare professional.

   anti-VLA-1 antibody to about 210 mg anti-VLA-1 antibody, for example, about 180 mg
   anti-VLA- 1 antibody, or about 190 mg anti-VLA- 1 antibody.
           In one embodiment, the plurality of unit dosage forms, when taken together, when
   administered to a human, will deliver about 0.03 mg anti-VLA- 1 antibody per kg of body
10 weight to about 10.0 mg anti-VLA-1 antibody per kg body weight.
           In one embodiment, each of the plurality of unit dosage forms has a volume of
   about 0.25 mL to about 3 mL, for example, about 1 mL, about 1.5 mL, about 2 mL, or
   about 2.5 mL.
           In one embodiment, each dosage form can contain an equal amount of antibody.
15
           In one aspect, the invention features a kit comprising a unit dosage form as
   described herein.
           In one aspect, the invention features a container, having disposed therein, an
   aqueous pharmaceutical composition described herein. In one embodiment, the container
20 has disposed therein, a unit dosage formulation as described herein.
           In one embodiment, the container is a delivery device, such as a syringe. In
   another embodiment, the container is suitable for subcutaneous administration.
           In one aspect, the invention features a method of administering an aqueous
25 pharmaceutical composition described herein by activating a delivery device, and then
   administering the anti-VLA- 1 antibody disposed in the delivery device to the patient.
           In one embodiment, activating the device comprises one of more of removing the
   device from a packaging, removing a cover from the needle or orifice of the device, or
   shaking the device. In another embodiment, activating the device further includes

                                                19

            In one embodiment, the patient, for example, a patient who has an inflammatory
   disorder, performs one or both steps of administering the composition.
            In one embodiment the patient has arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis;
   inflammatory bowel disease; lupus; transplant rejection; or psoriasis.
 5
            The invention features methods that optimize provision of a liquid formulation of
   an anti-VLA- 1 antibody, such as SAN-300, to a patient.
            In one embodiment, the method allows for a gradual increase in the concentration
   of the antibody provided. This allows ramp-up of antibody concentration and can allow
10 monitoring of the patient for tolerance, reactions and the like as the concentration is
   increased. For example, the method can start by providing SAN-300 to the patient at one
   or more initial or relatively low concentrations followed by providing SAN-300 to the
   patient at a final, higher concentration. Exemplary formulations for the initial
   concentration will typically have an antibody concentration of less than about 80%, less
15 than about 70%, less than about 50%, less than about 30%, less than about 20% or less
   than about 10% of the final higher concentration. Typical initial concentrations can be,
   for example, about 20 mg/mL, about 30 mg/mL, or about 40 mg/mL. Typical final
   concentrations will be, for example, about 150 mg/mL to about 225 mg/mL, for example,
   about 160 mg/mL, about 170 mg/mL, about 175 mg/mL, about 180 mg/mL, about
20 190 mg/mL, or about 200 mg/mL. In some embodiments, the patient will receive one, or
   a plurality of administrations at one or a plurality of initial concentrations. For example,
   in one embodiment, the patient will receive increasing concentrations over a number of
   administrations. In some embodiments, the patient will receive 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8
   administrations at one or more initial concentrations prior to reaching the final
25 concentration. For example, the patient will receive one or more administrations at a first
   initial concentration, and one or more administrations at a second higher concentration.
   In some embodiments, the patient is assessed after one or more administrations for
   symptoms, including adverse symptoms. In some embodiments, the patient is
   administered a formulation having an increased concentration of SAN-300 only after
30 determining that the patient does not have an unacceptable adverse reaction to the
   previous administration.
                                                20

            In one embodiment, the anti-VLA- 1 antibody composition is provided
   prepackaged in a container, which can be, for example, a delivery device, such as a
   syringe.
 5          In another aspect, the invention features a method of instructing a patient in need
   of an anti-VLA-1 antibody therapy how to administer a formulation described herein.
   The method includes (i) providing the patient with at least one unit dose of a formulation
   of an anti-VLA-1 antibody described herein; and (ii) instructing the patient to
   self-administer the at least one unit dose subcutaneously. Another method included in the
10 invention is a method of treatment that includes (i) providing the patient with at least two
   unit doses of a formulation of anti-VLA- 1 antibody; and (ii) instructing the patient to
   self-administer the unit doses subcutaneously, for example, subcutaneously, one dose at a
   time.
            In one embodiment, the patient has an inflammatory, immune, or autoimmune
15 disorder, such as an arthritic disorder, such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis,
   psoriatic arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis; tissue or organ graft rejection or graft
   versus-host disease; acute CNS injury, such as stroke or spinal cord injury; chronic renal
   disease; allergy, such as allergic asthma; type 1 diabetes; an inflammatory bowel disorder,
   such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis; myasthenia gravis; fibromyalgia; an
20 inflammatory/immune skin disorder, such as psoriasis, vitiligo, dermatitis, or lichen
   planus; systemic lupus erythematosus; Sjogren's Syndrome; a hematological cancer, such
   as multiple myeloma, leukemia, or lymphoma; a solid cancer, such as a sarcoma or
   carcinoma, such as of the lung, breast, prostate, or brain; or a fibrotic disorder, such as
   pulmonary fibrosis, myelofibrosis, liver cirrhosis, mesangial proliferative
25 glomerulonephritis, crescentic glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, or renal
   interstitial fibrosis.
            In another aspect, the invention features a method of treating a patient by
   administering to the patient a composition containing an anti-VLA-1 antibody in a
   formulation for subcutaneous administration, for example, a composition as described
30 herein. In one embodiment, the patient has an inflammatory disorder, such as arthritis,
   for example, rheumatoid arthritis (RA); an inflammatory bowel disease; lupus; transplant
                                                 21

   rejection; psoriasis; fibrosis; or Crohn's disease. In another embodiment, the composition
   is administered as a regimen. In another embodiment, the method further includes
   selecting a patient suitable for treatment with the composition. A patient suitable for
   treatment, for example, has demonstrated a sign or symptom indicative of disease onset,
 5 such as a sign or symptom indicative of RA. In yet another embodiment, the method
   further includes administering to the patient a second therapeutic agent, such as an
   anti-inflammatory, an antihistamine, an analgesic or a corticosteroid.
             In one embodiment, the patient has rheumatoid arthritis, and is selected on the
   basis that the patient has demonstrated an inadequate response to a prior alternate
10 treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. A "prior alternate treatment" refers to any treatment
   other than a treatment comprising an anti-VLA-1 antibody as described herein. The prior
   alternate treatment for rheumatoid arthritis can be, for example, a DMARD (Disease
   Modifying Antirheumatic Drug) or a TNF-a (Tumor Necrosis Factor- a) inhibitor. The
   DMARD can be, for example, methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, or
15 hydroxychloroquine. In one embodiment, the TNF-a inhibitor is an antibody, such as
   infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, or golimumab; or a fusion protein, such as
   etanercept. In another embodiment, the first therapeutic agent is an inhibitor of VLA-2,
   such as an anti-VLA-2 antibody, for example GBR 500.
            In one embodiment, the method of treating a patient further comprises
20 administering to the patient a second therapeutic agent, such as a corticosteroid, an
   anti-inflammatory, an antihistamine or an analgesic, such as acetaminophen.
            In another embodiment, the second therapeutic agent is a B cell-depleting agent,
   such as an anti-CD20 antibody, for example rituximab (Rituxan, Genentech, Inc., South
   San Francisco, CA; and IDEC Pharmaceutical, San Diego, CA). In yet another
25 embodiment, the second therapeutic agent is an inhibitor of a Janus kinase (JAK) family
   member or a Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) family member. JAK family members
   include JAKi, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2, and SYK family members include SYK and
   ZAP-70. In one embodiment, the second therapeutic agent is an inhibitor of JAK3, such
   as the small molecule inhibitor CP-690,550 (tofacitinib). In another embodiment, the
30 second therapeutic agent is a SYK inhibitor, such as the small molecule inhibitor R406,
   or its prodrug R788.
                                                 22

           In one embodiment, the patient has an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and is
   selected on the basis that the patient has demonstrated an inadequate response to a prior
   alternate treatment for IBD. The prior alternate treatment for IBD can be, for example,
   an inhibitor of an integrin, such as MAdCAM- 1 (Mucosal Vascular Addressin Cell
 5 Adhesion Molecule-1, a4 7 integrin). The MAdCAM-1 inhibitor can be an
   anti-MAdCAM-1 antibody, such as vedolizumab (MLN0002, Millennium
   Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA).
           In another embodiment, a subject is treated with one or more therapeutic agents
   prior to receiving an anti-VLA- 1 antibody therapy, such as an infusion of an anti-VLA- 1
10 therapy, such as to prevent or ameliorate adverse reactions to the anti-VLA- 1
   administration, for example, to prevent or ameliorate adverse events associated with
   infusion of an anti-VLA- 1 antibody. For example, in one embodiment, pre-treatment
   includes administration of one or more of an analgesic, such as acetaminophen, an
   antihistamine, or a corticosteroid, such as methylprednisolone.
15         In one embodiment, the pretreatment is administered 15 minutes to one hour or
   more, for example, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, or one hour or more, prior to
   administration of the anti-VLA- 1 antibody, such as prior to infusion of the anti-VLA- 1
   antibody.
           In one embodiment, a subject, such as an RA patient, is administered one or both
20 of acetaminophen and an antihistamine prior to administration of an anti-VLA- 1
   antibody, such as prior to infusion with an anti-VLA- 1 antibody. In one embodiment, an
   RA patient is administered a corticosteroid (also called a glucocorticoid), such as
   methylprednisolone, prior to treatment with an anti-VLA- 1 antibody.
           In one embodiment, the pretreatment is administered at a dose of from about
25 50 mg per 75 kg human to about 150 mg per 75 kg human. For example, the
   pretreatment, such as methylprenisolone administration, is delivered at a dose or from
   about 50 mg per 75 kg human, about 75 mg per 75 kg human, about 100 mg per 75 kg
   human, about 125 mg per 75 kg human, or about 150 mg per 75 kg human.
           In another embodiment, the pretreatment is administered 15 minutes to one hour
30 or more, for example, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, or one hour or more prior to
                                                23

   administration of the anti-VLA- 1 antibody, such as prior to infusion of the anti-VLA- 1
   antibody.
            The pretreatment can be administered, for example, by intravenous delivery, such
   as by infusion.
 5          In another aspect, the invention features a method of evaluating a patient by
   determining if the patient meets a preselected criterion, and if the patient meets the
   preselected criterion approving, providing, prescribing, or administering an anti-VLA- 1
   antibody formulation described herein to the patient. In one embodiment, the preselected
   criterion is the failure of the patient to adequately respond to a prior alternate therapeutic
10 treatment or regimen, such as for treatment of RA. In another embodiment, the criterion
   is as described in co-owned application serial no. 61/498,263, filed June 17, 2011, which
   is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
            In another aspect, the invention features a method of instructing a recipient on the
   administration of a formulation of SAN-300. The method includes instructing the
15 recipient, such as an end user, that the drug should be administered to a patient
   subcutaneously. In some embodiments, the end user is a patient, physician, retail or
   wholesale pharmacy, distributor, or pharmacy department at a hospital, nursing home
   clinic or HMO (Health Maintenance Organization).
20          In one aspect, the invention features a method of making an aqueous composition
   comprising about > 100 mg/mL to about 225 mg/mL of an anti-VLA- 1 antibody, for
   example, an aqueous composition described herein, by combining antibody, buffer,
   excipient, and a surfactant in proportion to obtain an aqueous composition comprising
   > 100 mg/mL to about 225 mg/mL of the anti-VLA- 1 antibody.
25          As used herein the term "excipient" is a pharmacologically inactive substance
   used as a carrier for the active ingredients of a medication.
            In one embodiment, the buffer is histidine, and in another embodiment, the buffer
   is acetate. In another embodiment, the excipient is sorbitol, and in another embodiment,
   the excipient is sodium chloride. In yet another embodiment, the surfactant is
30 polysorbate 80, and in another embodiment the surfactant is polysorbate 20. In one

   antibody. The method includes, for example, evaluating whether the package has
   expired. The expiration date is at least 6 months, at least 12 months, at least 18 months,
   at least 24 months, at least 36 months, or at least 48 months, for example, greater than 24
   months or greater than 36 months, from a preselected event, such as manufacturing,
20 assaying, or packaging. In some embodiments, a decision or step is taken as a result of
   the analysis. For example, the antibody in the package is used or discarded, classified,
   selected, released or withheld, shipped, moved to a new location, released into
   commerce, sold, or offered for sale, withdrawn from commerce or no longer offered for
   sale, depending on whether the product has expired.
25          In another aspect, the invention features a package containing at least 2 unit doses
   of an aqueous composition containing an anti-VLA- 1 antibody. In one embodiment, all
   of the unit doses contain the same amount of antibody, and in other embodiments, there
   are unit dosages of two or more strengths, or two or more different formulations. For
   example, different formulations can have different strengths or release properties. In one
30 embodiment, at least one dosage contains anti-VLA- 1 antibody at about 80 mg to about
   315 mg, for example, about 100 mg, about 160 mg, about 180 mg, about 190 mg, about
                                                 25

   formulation of an anti-VLA- 1 antibody composition, for example, one made by a process
   described herein, and providing an evaluation of the formulation by assessing a solution
   parameter, such as color (for example, colorless to slightly yellow, or colorless to
   yellow), clarity (for example, clear to slightly opalescent or clear to opalescent ), or
25 viscosity (for example, about 5 cP to about 30 cP (for example, about 10 cP or about
   20 cP) when measured at ambient temperature, such as at about 20 'C to about 30 'C, for
   example, about 25 C). The evaluation can include an assessment of one or more
   solution parameters. Optionally, a determination of whether the solution parameter meets
   a preselected criteria is determined, for example, whether the preselected criteria is
30 present, or is present in a preselected range, is determined, thereby analyzing the process.
                                                 26

           In one embodiment, the invention includes a measure of the stability of the anti
   VLA- 1 antibody formulation. Stability of the antibody formulation can be measured, for
   example, by aggregate formation, which is assayed, for example, by size exclusion high
   pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), by color, clarity, or viscosity as described
 5 herein. A formulation can be determined to be stable, and therefore acceptable for further
   processing or distribution, if the change in an assay parameter is less than about 10%, less
   than about 5%, less than about 3%, less than about 2%, less than about 1%, less than
   about 0.5%, less than about 0.05%, or less than about 0.005% or less, over a pre-set
   period of time, and optionally at a given temperature. In one embodiment, a liquid
10 anti-VLA- 1 antibody formulation is stable for 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, or 5 days or
   more at room temperature, such as at about 18 'C, about 19 'C, about 20 'C, about 21 'C,
   about 22 'C, about 23 'C, about 24 'C, or about 25 'C.

   method or analysis described herein. In one embodiment, the method further includes
   maintaining or altering the manufacturing process based, at least in part, upon the method
   or analysis. Thus, in another embodiment the party making the evaluation does not
   practice the method or analysis described herein but merely relies on results which are
25 obtained by a method or analysis described herein.
           In another embodiment the method includes comparing two or more preparations
   in a method of monitoring or controlling batch-to-batch variation or to compare a
   preparation to a reference standard.
           In yet another embodiment, the method can further include making a decision,
30 such as a decision to classify, select, accept or discard, release or withhold, process into a
   drug product, ship, move to a different location, formulate, label, package, release into
                                                 27

   commerce, sell or offer for sale the preparation, based, at least in part, upon the
   determination.

   example, a patient or healthcare provider;
10         instructing the recipient to store the formulation at a suitable temperature, such as
   at 2 'C to 8 'C; and
           after receipt by the recipient, storing the formulation for up to 24 months,
   36 months, or 48 months at the suitable temperature, such as at 2 0 to 8 'C.
15         In another aspect, the invention features a method of complying with a regulatory
   requirement, such as a post approval requirement of a regulatory agency, such as the
   FDA. The method includes providing an evaluation of an antibody formulation for a
   solution parameter, such as color (for example, colorless to slightly yellow, or colorless to
   yellow), clarity (for example, clear to slightly opalescent or clear to opalescent ), or
20 viscosity (for example, about 5 cP to about 30 cP when measured at ambient temperature,
   such as at 20 'C to 30 C). The post approval requirement can include a measure of one
   more of the above parameters. The method also includes, optionally, determining
   whether the observed solution parameter meets a preselected criteria or if the parameter is
   in a preselected range; optionally, memorializing the value or result of the analysis, or
25 communicating with the agency, such as by transmitting the value or result to the
   regulatory agency.
           In another aspect, the invention features a method of making a batch of an
   aqueous formulation of anti-VLA- 1 antibody having a preselected property, for example,
   meeting a release specification, label requirement, or compendial requirement, for
30 example, a property described herein. The method includes providing a test antibody
   preparation; analyzing the test antibody preparation according to a method described
                                                  28

   herein; determining if the test antibody preparation satisfies a preselected criteria, such as
   by having a preselected relationship with a reference value, such as one or more reference
   values disclosed herein, and selecting the test antibody preparation to make a batch of
   product.
 5         In another aspect, the invention features multiple batches of an aqueous
   formulation of anti-VLA- 1 antibody, wherein one or more solution parameters (for
   example, a value or solution parameter determined by a method described herein), for
   each batch varies less than a preselected range from a pre-selected desired reference
   value or criteria, for example, a range or criteria described herein. In some
10 embodiments, one or more parameters for one or more batches of an antibody
   formulation, is determined and a batch or batches selected as a result of the
   determination. Some embodiments include comparing the results of the determination to
   a preselected value or criteria, such as a reference standard. Other embodiments include
   adjusting the dose of the batch to be administered, such as based on the result of the
15 determination of the value or parameter.
           In another aspect, the invention features a method of one or more of: providing a
   report to a report-receiving entity, evaluating a sample of an aqueous formulation of
   anti-VLA- 1 antibody for compliance with a reference standard, such as an FDA
   requirement, seeking indication from another party that a preparation of the anti-VLA- 1
20 antibody meets some predefined requirement, or submitting information about a
   preparation of an anti-VLA- 1 antibody to another party. Exemplary receiving entities or
   other parties include a government, such as the U.S. federal government, of a government
   agency, such as the FDA. The method includes one or more (or all) of the following
   steps for making and/or testing an aqueous formulation of anti-VLA- 1 antibody in a first
25 country, such as the US; sending at least an aliquot of the sample outside the first country,
   for example, sending it outside the United States, to a second country; preparing, or
   receiving, a report which includes data about the structure of the preparation of the
   anti-VLA- 1 antibody, for example, data related to a structure and/or chain described
   herein, such as data generated by one or more of the methods described herein; and
30 providing said report to a report recipient entity.
                                                 29

            In one embodiment, the report-receiving entity can determine if a predetermined
   requirement or reference value is met by the data and, optionally, a response from the
   report-receiving entity is received, such as by a manufacturer, distributor or seller of an
   aqueous formulation of an anti-VLA- 1 antibody. In one embodiment, upon receipt of
 5 approval from the report recipient entity, the preparation of anti-VLA- 1 antibody is
   selected, packaged, or placed into commerce.
            In one aspect, the invention features a method of evaluating the quality of a
   composition described herein, where the method includes evaluating the composition for
   a preselected parameter, and determining whether the value meets a preselected criteria.
10 Responsive to the evaluation, the composition can be classified, selected, accepted or
   discarded, released or withheld, processed into a drug product, shipped, moved to a
   different location, formulated, labeled, packaged, released into commerce, or sold or
   offered for sale. In another embodiment, the composition evaluated is provided as a unit
   dosage form.
15          In one embodiment, the preselected parameter is selected from aggregation,
   stability, color, clarity, viscosity, or plunger force.
            In one embodiment, the method includes providing a comparison of the value
   determined for a parameter with a reference value, or values, to thereby evaluate the
   sample. The comparison can include, for example, determining if the test value has a
20 preselected relationship with the reference value, for example, determining if it meets the
   reference value. The value need not be a numerical value but can be merely an indication
   of whether the subject entity is present.
            In one embodiment, the method includes determining if a test value is equal to or
   greater than a reference value, if it is less than or equal to a reference value, or if it falls
25 within a range (either inclusive or exclusive of one or both endpoints).
            In some embodiments, the test value, or an indication of whether the preselected
   relationship is met, can be memorialized, such as in a computer readable record.
            In some embodiments, a decision or step is taken, for example, the sample is
   classified, selected, accepted or discarded, released or withheld, processed into a drug
30 product, shipped, moved to a different location, formulated, labeled, packaged, released
   into commerce, or sold or offered for sale, depending on whether the preselected
                                                   30

   relationship is met. For example, based on the result of the determination, or upon
   comparison to a reference standard, the batch from which the sample is taken can be
   processed, such as just described.
 5         In one aspect, the invention features a method of evaluating an aqueous
   formulation of anti-VLA- 1 antibody. The method includes receiving data with regard to
   the presence or level of anti-VLA- 1 antibody; providing a record which includes said
   data and optionally includes an identifier for a batch of anti-VLA- 1 antibody; submitting
   said record to a decision-maker, for example, a government agency, such as the FDA;
10 optionally, receiving a communication from the decision maker; optionally, deciding
   whether to release or market the batch of anti-VLA- 1 antibody based on the
   communication from the decision maker. In one embodiment, the method further
   includes releasing the sample.

            In some embodiments, any of the above formulations 1 to 24 can be essentially
   free of an amino acid, such as arginine.
            Methods and compositions disclosed herein can be used where the presence,
15 distribution, or amount, of one or more structures in the mixture may possess or impinge
   on the biological activity. The methods are also useful from a structure-activity
   prospective, to evaluate or ensure biological equivalence.
            An "anti-VLA-1 antibody formulation" as used herein, refers to an aqueous
   formulation containing an anti-VLA-1 antibody, such as SAN-300, at a concentration of
20 > 100 mg/mL to about 225 mg/mL, for example, about 110 mg/mL, about 120 mg/mL,
   about 130 mg/mL, about 140 mg/mL, about 150 mg/mL, about 160 mg/mL, about 170
   mg/mL, about 180 mg/mL, about 190 mg/mL, about 200 mg/mL, about 205 mg/mL,
   about 210 mg/mL, about 215 mg/mL, about 220 mg/mL.
            "Suitable for subcutaneous administration" means that a composition, provided,
25 e.g., as unit dosage, provides antibody at a concentration sufficient to allow a therapeutic
   effect from an amount, typically from about 0.5 mL to about 3 mL, that can be delivered
   by subcutaneous injection. It may be free of components, such as citrate, that cause
   unwanted injection site symptoms, such as burning or stinging.
            The term "treating" refers to administering a therapy in an amount, manner,
30 and/or mode effective to improve a condition, symptom, or parameter associated with a
   disorder or to prevent progression of a disorder, to either a statistically significant degree
                                                37

   or to a degree detectable to one skilled in the art. An effective amount, manner, or mode
   can vary depending on the subject and may be tailored to the subject.
            A "stable" formulation of anti-VLA-1 antibody exhibits little or no signs of any
   one or more of aggregation, precipitation, fragmentation, deamidation, oxidation,
 5 denaturation, size modification, chemical alteration, or change in biological activity, such
   as the ability to bind VLA- 1, over a predetermined period of time. The predetermined
   period of time can be, for example, equal to or more than 4 days, 10 days, 14 days,
   21 days, 30 days or longer, such as for 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months,
   1 year, 2 years, 3 years, for example, when stored under suitable conditions. Exemplary
10 suitable conditions include, for example, a temperature of about 2 'C to about 8 'C, for
   example, at about 4 'C, in darkness, in a closed container. In one embodiment, the
   container is the same type that the composition will be provided to the end user. In
   another embodiment, a stable formulation will meet manufacturer or regulatory (such as
   Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or a foreign counterpart to the FDA) release or
15 package label or insert requirements, such as for the times and conditions mentioned
   above. For example, in one embodiment, less than about 1%, less than about 2%, less
   than about 5%, less than about 10%, or less than about 15% of the composition is
   aggregated, fragmented, or oxidized at the end of the predetermined period or otherwise
   at the time of evaluation for stability. Aggregation, precipitation, and/or denaturation can
20 be assessed by known methods, such as visual examination of color and/or clarity, or by
   UV light scattering, size exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering (DLS), or
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The ability of the protein to retain its biological
   activity can be assessed by detecting and quantifying chemically altered forms of the
   antibody. Size modification, such as clipping, can be evaluated using size exclusion
25 chromatography, SDS-PAGE and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF MS), or peptide mapping of
   endoproteinase-treated antibody, for example. Other types of chemical alteration include
   charge alteration, such as that may occur as a result of deamidation, can be evaluated by
   ion-exchange chromatography, for example. An antibody "retains its biological activity"
30 in a pharmaceutical formulation, if the biological activity of the antibody at a given time
   is within about 1%, about 2%, about 5%, about 10%, or about 15% of the biological
                                                 38

   activity exhibited at the time the pharmaceutical formulation was prepared as determined,
   for example, in an antigen binding assay.
           "Aggregation" as used herein, refers to the formation of insoluble structures from
   completely or partially unfolded polypeptides, such as anti-VLA-1 antibodies.
 5 "Fragmentation" as used herein, refers to partially degraded proteins, such as anti-VLA-1
   antibodies. "Deamidation" refers to the removal of an amide group from a polypeptide,
   such as an anti-VLA- 1 antibody. Deamidation typically occurs at glutaminyl or
   asparaginyl amino acid residues, and can cause structural changes in the protein that
   affect protein function, such as binding affinity for a VLA- 1 ligand.
10         As used herein, "syringeability" refers to the suitability of a composition for
   delivery with a syringe. One component of syringeability is the ability of a composition,
   such as an anti-VLA-1 antibody composition, to be expelled from a syringe, such as by a
   patient for self-administration, or by a health-care provider. Self-administration by the
   patient can be, for example, by subcutaneous administration. The pressure, or "plunger
15 force" can be, for example, such that a patient, for example, an elderly or weak patient,
   can self administer the composition. In embodiments the plunger force is equal to or less
   than 4 lbs.
           In one embodiment, the plunger force will allow delivery of a unit dosage in
   10 seconds or less. In another embodiment, about 1 mL of an aqueous pharmaceutical
20 composition, disposed in a syringe having a needle of a preselected gauge, can be
   expelled at a preselected rate with a plunger force of no more than a preselected amount.
   In another embodiment, about 2 mL of aqueous pharmaceutical composition, disposed in
   a syringe having a needle of a preselected gauge, can be expelled at a preselected rate
   with a plunger force of no more than a preselected amount. For example, about 1 mL
25 aqueous pharmaceutical composition, disposed in a syringe having a 25 gauge needle, a
   27 guage needle, or a 30 guage needle can be expelled at 10 mL/minute with a plunger
   force of no more than 4 lbs.
             In one embodiment, a suitable plunger force, such as a force equal to or less
   than 4 lbs, will allow delivery of a unit dosage within a preselected time period, such as
30 in 10 seconds or less.
                                                 39

           Syringeability also refers to the ability of the protein to survive passage though a
   needle without fragmenting by more than about 1%, more than about 2%, more than
   about 5%, more than about 10% or more than about 15%.
 5         An "anti-VLA-1 antibody" refers to an antibody that binds to a VLA-1 integrin,
   such as to the a l subunit of the VLA- 1 integrin, and at least partially inhibits an activity
   of VLA- 1, particularly a binding activity of a VLA- 1 integrin or a signaling activity, such
   as the ability to transduce a VLA- 1 mediated signal. For example, an anti-VLA- 1
   antibody may inhibit binding of VLA- 1 to a cognate ligand of VLA- 1, for example, an
10 extracellular matrix component, such as collagen, for example, collagen I or collagen IV,
   or laminin. An anti-VLA- 1 antibody may bind to either the alI subunit or the       P1 subunit,
   or to both. In one embodiment, the antibody binds an epitope on the I domain of al. An
   anti-VLA-1 antibody may bind to VLA-1 with a Kd of less than about 10-6, less than
   about 10-7, less than about 10-8, less than about 10-9, less than about 10-10, or less than
15 about 10-1 1 M. VLA-1 is also known as al/P1 and CD49a/CD29.
           As used herein, the term "antibody" refers to a protein that includes at least one
   immunoglobulin variable region, such as an amino acid sequence that provides an
   immunoglobulin variable domain or immunoglobulin variable domain sequence. For
   example, an antibody can include a heavy (H) chain variable region (abbreviated herein
20 as VH), and a light (L) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL). In another
   example, an antibody includes two heavy (H) chain variable regions and two light (L)
   chain variable regions. The term "antibody" encompasses antigen-binding fragments of
   antibodies (such as single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab') 2 fragments, Fd
   fragments, Fv fragments, and dAb fragments) as well as complete antibodies, for
25 example, intact immunoglobulins of types IgA, IgG, IgE, IgD, IgM (as well as subtypes
   thereof). The light chains of the immunoglobulin may be of types kappa or lambda. In
   one embodiment, the antibody is glycosylated. An antibody can be functional for
   antibody dependent cytotoxicity and/or complement-mediated cytotoxicity, or may be
   non-functional for one or both of these activities.
30         An immunoglobulin variable domain sequence is an amino acid sequence that can
   form the structure of an immunoglobulin variable domain. For example, the sequence
                                                 40

   may include all or part of the amino acid sequence of a naturally-occurring variable
   domain. For example, the sequence may omit one, two or more N- or C-terminal amino
   acids, internal amino acids, may include one or more insertions or additional terminal
   amino acids, or may include other alterations. In one embodiment, a polypeptide that
 5 includes an immunoglobulin variable domain sequence can associate with another
   immunoglobulin variable domain sequence to form a target binding structure (or "antigen
   binding site"), for example, a structure that interacts with VLA-1.
           The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability,
10 termed "complementarity determining regions" ("CDR"), interspersed with regions that
   are more conserved, termed "framework regions" (FR). The extent of the FRs and CDRs
   has been precisely defined (see, Kabat, E.A., et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteinsof
   Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
   NIH Publication No. 91-3242; and Chothia, C. et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917).
15 Kabat definitions are used herein. Each VH and VL is typically composed of three CDRs
   and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxyl-terminus in the following order:
   FRI, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4.
           The VH or VL chain of the antibody can further include all or part of a heavy or
   light chain constant region, to thereby form a heavy or light immunoglobulin chain,
20 respectively. In one embodiment, the antibody is a tetramer of two heavy
   immunoglobulin chains and two light immunoglobulin chains. The heavy and light
   immunoglobulin chains can be connected by disulfide bonds. The heavy chain constant
   region typically includes three constant domains, CHI, CH2 and CH3. The light chain
   constant region typically includes a CL domain. The variable region of the heavy and
25 light chains contains a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant
   regions of the antibodies typically mediate the binding of the antibody to host tissues or
   factors, including various cells of the immune system (such as effector cells) and the first
   component (Clq) of the classical complement system.
           One or more regions of an antibody can be human, effectively human, or
30 humanized. For example, one or more of the variable regions can be human or
   effectively human. For example, one or more of the CDRs, such as HC CDR1, HC
                                                41

   CDR2, HC CDR3, LC CDR1, LC CDR2, and LC CDR3, can be human (HC, heavy
   chain; LC, light chain). In one embodiment, each of the light chain CDRs can be human.
   In one embodiment, HC CDR3 is human. One or more of the framework regions can be
   human, such as FRI, FR2, FR3, and/or FR4 of the HC or LC. In one embodiment, all the
 5 framework regions are human, for example, derived from a human somatic cell, such as a
   hematopoietic cell that produces immunoglobulins or a non-hematopoietic cell. In one
   embodiment, the human sequences are germline sequences, for example, encoded by a
   germline nucleic acid. One or more of the constant regions can be human, effectively
   human, or humanized. In another embodiment, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at
10 least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 92%, at least about
   95%, or at least about 98% of the framework regions, such as FRI, FR2, and FR3,
   collectively, or FRI, FR2, FR3, and FR4, collectively, or the entire antibody can be
   human, effectively human, or humanized. For example, FRI, FR2, and FR3 collectively
   can be at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at
15 least about 90%, at least about 92%, at least about 95%, at least about 98%, or at least
   about 99% identical to a human sequence encoded by a human germline segment.
           An effectively human immunoglobulin variable region is an immunoglobulin
   variable region that includes a sufficient number of human framework amino acid
   positions such that the immunoglobulin variable region does not elicit an immunogenic
20 response in a normal human. An "effectively human" antibody is an antibody that
   includes a sufficient number of human amino acid positions such that the antibody does
   not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human.
           A humanized immunoglobulin variable region is an immunoglobulin variable
   region that is modified such that the modified form elicits less of an immune response in
25 a human than does the non-modified form. For example, a humanized immunoglobulin
   variable region can be modified to include a sufficient number of human framework
   amino acid positions such that the immunoglobulin variable region does not elicit an
   immunogenic response in a normal human. Descriptions of humanized immunoglobulins
   include, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,213 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762. In some
30 embodiments, a humanized immunoglobulin includes a non-human amino acid at one or
   more framework amino acid positions.
                                                42

            All or part of an antibody can be encoded by an immunoglobulin gene or a
   segment thereof. Exemplary human immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, a
   (IgA1 and IgA2), gamma (IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), delta, epsilon and mu constant
   region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Full-length
 5 immunoglobulin "light chains" (about 25 Kd or 214 amino acids) are encoded by a
   variable region gene at the NH2-terminus (about 110 amino acids) and a kappa or lambda
   constant region gene at the COOH-terminus. Full-length immunoglobulin "heavy
   chains" (about 50 Kd or 446 amino acids) are similarly encoded by a variable region gene
   (about 116 amino acids) and one of the other aforementioned constant region genes, such
10 as gamma (encoding about 330 amino acids).
            The term "antigen-binding fragment" of a full length antibody refers to one or
   more fragments of a full-length antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to a
   target of interest, such as VLA- 1. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within
   the term antigen-binding fragment of a full length antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a
15 monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CHI domains; (ii) a F(ab') 2
   fragment, a bivalent fragment including two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at
   the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CHI domains; (iv) a Fv
   fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb
   fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; and
20 (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR) that retains functionality.
   Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by
   separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that
   enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to
   form monovalent molecules known as single chain Fv (scFv). See for example, Bird et
25 al. (1988) Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
   85:5879-5883.
            Calculations of homology or sequence identity between two sequences (the terms
   are used interchangeably herein) are performed as follows. The sequences are aligned for
   optimal comparison purposes (for example, gaps can be introduced in one or both of a
30 first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and
   non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). The optimal
                                                43

   alignment is determined as the best score using the GAP program in the GCG software
   package with a Blossum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty
   of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at
   corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a
 5 position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as
   the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that
   position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid "identity" is equivalent to amino acid
   or nucleic acid "homology"). The percent identity between the two sequences is a
   function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences.
10           Guidance for performing hybridization reactions can be found in Current
   Protocolsin MolecularBiology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6, which is
   incorporated by reference. Aqueous and nonaqueous methods are described in that
   reference and either can be used. High stringency hybridization conditions include
   hybridization in 6X SSC at about 45'C, followed by one or more washes in 0.2X SSC,
15 0.1% SDS at 65'C, or substantially similar conditions.
             Certain advantages are provided by embodiments of the invention. In some cases,
   it is difficult to make high concentration formulations of proteins, such as antibodies, for
   use in pharmaceutical compositions. Methods of preparing such formulations are
20 presented herein. Pharmaceutical compositions containing high concentrations of
   protein, such as anti-VLA- 1 antibody, can be useful for administration over a shorter time
   frame. A formulation of, for example, anti-VLA- 1 antibody, can also be administered by
   simplified methods (for example, subcutaneously).

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
           Provided herein are stable formulations of an anti-VLA- 1 antibody particularly
25 well suited for subcutaneous (SC) administration. The formulations featured in the
   invention contain from about > 100 to about 225 mg/mL humanized anti-VLA-1
   antibody, such as SAN-300.
                                                92

           PharmaceuticalCompositions
           The compositions described herein are formulated as pharmaceutical
   compositions. An anti-VLA-1 antibody, such as SAN-300, can be provided, for example,
 5 in a buffered solution at a concentration of about 160 mg/mL to about 210 mg/mL, for
   example, about 160 mg/mL to about 200 mg/mL, about 170 mg/mL to about 190 mg/mL;
   for example, about 165 mg/mL, about 170 mg/mL, about 175 mg/mL, about 180 mg/mL,
   about 185 mg/mL, about 190 mg/mL, about 195 mg/mL, about 200 mg/mL, about 205
   mg/mL. In one embodiment, the anti-VLA-1 antibody, such as SAN-300, is provided in
10 a buffered solution at a concentration greater than about 100 mg/mL and less than about
   225 mg/mL. In another embodiment, the formulation is prepared at a higher
   concentration, for example, about 200 mg/mL to about 210 mg/mL, and then diluted back
   to the desired concentration, such as to about 180 mg/mL to about 190 mg/mL. In one
   embodiment, the formulation is administered at the stock concentration (for example, at
15 about 110 mg/mL, about 120 mg/mL, about 130 mg/mL, about 140 mg/mL, about
   150 mg/mL, about 160 mg/mL, about 165 mg/mL, about 170 mg/mL, about 175 mg/mL,
   about 180 mg/mL, about 185 mg/mL, about 190 mg/mL, about 195 mg/mL, about
   200 mg/mL, about 205 mg/mL, about 210 mg/mL).
           The composition can be stored at a suitable temperature, such as at about 2 'C to
20 about 8 'C, for example, at about 4 'C, about 5'C, about 6C, or about 7C.
           In one embodiment, the anti-VLA- 1 antibody can be formulated with an
   excipient, such as sorbitol or NaCl, a histidine buffer, and a surfactant, such as
   polysorbate 20 or polysorbate 80.
           Acetate buffers are known in the art and include, for example, aqueous solutions
25 of sodium acetate, triethylammonium acetate buffer, and Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer,
   brought to the proper pH.
           Histidine buffers are also known in the art and include, for example, aqueous
   solutions of D-histidine, D-histidine monochloride monohydrate, DL-histidine,
   DL-histidine monochloride monohydrate, L-histidine, or L-histidine monochloride
30 monohydrate, brought to the proper pH with either hydrochloric acid or sodium
   hydroxide, or other acid or base known in the art.
                                                93

            In one embodiment, the anti-VLA- 1 antibody formulation can be substantially
   free of citrate. In another embodiment, the anti-VLA antibody formulation is
   substantially free of arginine.
            A pharmaceutical composition may also include solvents, dispersion media,
 5 coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and
   the like that are physiologically compatible. An "isotonic" formulation has equal osmotic
   pressure, such as caused by equal solute concentration inside and outside a cell.
            A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to a salt that retains the desired
   biological activity of the antibody and does not impart any undesired toxicological effects
10 (see, for example, Berge, S.M., et al. (1977) J. Pharm. Sci. 66:1-19). Examples of such
   salts include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Acid addition salts include those
   derived from nontoxic inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric,
   hydrobromic, hydroiodic, and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic acids such as
   aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy
15 alkanoic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, free amino acids,
   and the like. Base addition salts include those derived from alkaline earth metals, such as
   sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic
   amines, such as N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, chloroprocaine,
   choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, procaine and the like.
20          The formulations featured herein can include a pharmaceutically acceptable
   excipient, such as a surfactant, such as polysorbate 80, or polysorbate 20. In one
   embodiment, the formulations featured herein include a surfactant at a concentration of
   about 0.001% to about 0.8%, for example, about 0.005% to about 0.05%; for example,
   about 0.01% to about 0.01%. As used herein, the concentration of surfactant is provided
25 as a percentage of weight to volume (w/v)
            The pharmaceutical compositions containing anti-VLA-1 antibodies are in the
   form of a liquid solution, such as an injectable and infusible solution. Such compositions
   can be administered by a parenteral mode, such as by subcutaneous administration. The
   formulations are also suitable for intravenous (IV) administration, for example, when
30 diluted into an acceptable infusion matrix, such as normal saline. The phrases "parenteral
   administration" and "administered parenterally" as used herein mean modes of
                                                94

   administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and
   include subcutaneous administration, as well as intramuscular, intravenous, intracapsular,
   intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcuticular,
   subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural and intrasternal injection and infusion.
 5 In one embodiment, the formulations described herein are administered subcutaneously.
            Pharmaceutical compositions are sterile and stable under the conditions of
   manufacture and storage. A pharmaceutical composition can also be tested to insure it
   meets regulatory and industry standards for administration.
            Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating an anti-VLA-1
10 antibody described herein in the required amount in an appropriate formulation as
   described above, followed by filtered sterilization.
            In one embodiment, the final anti-VLA- 1 antibody formulation is packaged as a
   liquid in a 3.0 mL fill vial with an extractable minimum volume of 1 mL. For example,
   the fill vial can include about 1.1 mL to about 1.5 mL (for example, about 1.1 mL, about
15 1.2 mL, about 1.3 mL, about 1.4 mL) of antibody formulation. In another embodiment,
   that antibody formulation is packaged in a pre-filled syringe, in an amount such that 1 mL
   of solution is injected into a patient upon use, and the 1 mL solution delivers the desired
   amount of antibody, for example, > 100 mg SAN-300 to 225 mg SAN-300, for example,
   180 mg SAN-300 or 190 mg SAN-300.
20          In some embodiments, parameters that describe the formulations, for example,
   parameters that may appear on the product label, are characterized. Such parameters
   include, for example, color (typically colorless to slightly yellow, or colorless to yellow),
   clarity (typically clear to slightly opalescent, or clear to opalescent), and viscosity
   (typically about 5 cP to about 30 cP when measured at ambient temperature, such as at
25 about 20 'C to about 30 C). Such parameters can be measured by methods known in the
   art. For example, clarity can be measured using commercially available opalescence
   standards (available from, for example, HunterLab Associates, Inc., Reston, VA).
            In some embodiments, the stability of the antibody formulations is assayed.
   Exemplary methods include, for example, aggregation studies, oxidation studies,
30 fragmentation studies, sialylation studies, isoelectric point studies, half-antibody studies,
   heavy and light chain parity studies, and analysis of secondary structure, such as by
                                                 95

   circular dichroism; thermal denaturation, such as by circular dichroism of differential
   scanning calorimetry; tryptophan environment, such as by fluorescence; IgG fold, such as
   by far UV circular dichroism; and aromatic residue environment, such as by UV-Visible
   ("UV-Vis") spectroscopy.
 5
            SAN-300 and Other anti-VLA-1 Antibodies
            Antibodies suitable for an anti-VLA- 1 antibody formulation described herein
   include SAN-300, a humanized al integrin binding antibody. The amino acid sequence
   of the light chain and heavy chain of SAN-300 prior to any in vivo modifications (such as
10 clipping of amino acids) is shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, respectively. The amino acid
   sequence of the light chain and heavy chain variable domains is shown in FIGs. 2A and
   2B, respectively.
            VLA- 1 is a major collagen I, collagen IV and laminin receptor. It is expressed in
   many different cell types including those of hematopoietic, neuronal and mesenchymal
15 origin. The VLA- 1 integrin plays an important role in chronic inflammation and fibrosis
   processes. The a chain of VLA- 1 contains an inserted I domain (also known as an A
   domain) that plays a central role in ligand binding. The I-domain of human VLA- 1 is
   located at about from amino acids Thrl45-Glu336 of VLA-1 (Ref Seq No. NP_852478;
   FIGs. 1A-iD). The I-domain has a dinucleotide-binding fold characterized by a n-sheet
20 surrounded by a-helices. The I domain contains a conserved metal
   ion-dependent-adhesion site (MIDAS) that has been identified to constitute part of the
   ligand binding site. The acidic residue side-chains of a bound integrin ligand, such as a
   collagen, coordinates the metal ion of the I domain MIDAS site. Crystal structure studies
   have indicated that SAN-300 uses an aspartic acid to coordinate the VLA- II domain
25 metal ion. SAN-300 inhibits VLA-1 at least by sterically preventing binding of the
   I-domain to collagen (Karpuses et al., J. Mol. Biol. 327:1031-1041, 2003).
            Anti-VLA-1 antibodies can block the interaction of pro-inflammatory leukocytes
   with components of the extracellular matrix including, but not limited to collagens, e.g.,
   collagen I and IV, laminin and fibronectin. The VLA- 1 is expressed, for example, on
30 lymphocytes, and the I-domain of VLA-1 is important for binding of lymphocytes to
                                                96

   extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin (Fabbri et al., Tissue Antigens 48:47-51,
   1996).
            SAN-300 binds the al I domain of VLA-1 (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,358,054).
   Further SAN-300 binds human but not rat al-I domain (Id.).
 5          SAN-300 and related anti-VLA-I antibodies are described, for example, in U.S.
   Pat. No. 6,955,810, U.S. Pat. No. 7,462,353, U.S. Pat. No. 7,358,054, U.S. Pat. No.
   7,723,073, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,910,099. The contents of these patents are incorporated
   herein by reference in their entirety. SAN-300 is a humanized version of murine
   monoclonal AQC2 antibody (see, for example, U.S. 6,955,810, and U.S. 7,358,054).
10 Several additional anti-VLA-1 monoclonal antibodies include 1B3.1 (Chess et al.
   U.S. 5,788,966), TS2/7 and FB12 (Fabbri et al., Tissue Antigens 48:47-51, 1996), 5E8D9
   (Luque et al., FEBS Letters 346:278-284, 1994), and SR-84 (Rikkonen et al., Biochem.
   Biophys. Res. Commun. 209:205-212, 1995).
            Some anti-VLA- 1 antibodies recognize epitopes of the al subunit that are
15 involved in binding to a cognate ligand, such as collagen and laminin. Many such
   antibodies inhibit binding of VLA- 1 to the cognate ligands.
            An exemplary anti-VLA- 1 antibody has one or more CDRs, for example, all three
   HC CDRs and/or all three LC CDRs of a particular antibody disclosed herein, or CDRs
   that are, in sum, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 92%, at least 94%, at
20 least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to such an
   antibody, for example a SAN-300 antibody. In one embodiment, the HI and H2
   hypervariable loops have the same canonical structure as those of an antibody described
   herein. In one embodiment, the LI and L2 hypervariable loops have the same canonical
   structure as those of an antibody described herein.
25          In one embodiment, the amino acid sequence of the HC and/or LC variable
   domain sequence is at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 92%, at
   least 95%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or at least 100% identical to the amino
   acid sequence of the HC and/or LC variable domain of an antibody described herein,
   such as a SAN-300 antibody. The amino acid sequence of the HC and/or LC variable
30 domain sequence can differ by at least one amino acid, but no more than ten, eight, six,
   five, four, three, or two amino acids from the corresponding sequence of an antibody
                                                97

   described herein, such as a SAN-300 antibody. For example, the differences may be
   primarily or entirely in the framework regions.
           The amino acid sequences of the HC and LC variable domain sequences can be
   encoded by a nucleic acid sequence that hybridizes under high stringency conditions to a
 5 nucleic acid sequence described herein or one that encodes a variable domain or an amino
   acid sequence described herein. In one embodiment, the amino acid sequences of one or
   more framework regions (for example, FRI, FR2, FR3, and/or FR4) of the HC and/or LC
   variable domain are at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 92%, at
   least 95%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or at least 100% identical to
10 corresponding framework regions of the HC and LC variable domains of an antibody
   described herein. In one embodiment, one or more heavy or light chain framework
   regions (for example, HC FRI, FR2, and FR3) are at least 70%, at least 80%, at least
   85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 100%
   identical to the sequence of corresponding framework regions from a human germline
15 antibody.
           Suitable antibodies for use in the methods described herein include: antibodies
   having one, two, or three light chain (LC) CDRs and one, two or three heavy chain (HC)
   CDRs, and in an embodiment all six CDRs, having the sequence of an antibody disclosed
   in U.S. Patent No. 7,358,054; antibodies wherein each of the CDRs differs by no more
20 than 1 or 2 amino acids from the CDRs of an antibody disclosed in U.S. Patent
   No. 7,358,054 (variant amino acids, when used in this context, can be independently, or
   as a group, conservative on non-conservative changes).
           In one embodiment, an anti-VLA- 1 antibody useful for the methods described

   residues, 5 amino acid residues, or 1 amino acid residue, or both, from the corresponding
   portions of an antibody disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 7,358,054.
            In one embodiment, an anti-VLA- 1 antibody useful for the methods described
   herein includes a light chain variable region that is the same as or differs by no more than
 5 10 amino acids, 5 amino acids, 3 amino acids, or 1 amino acid from the sequence of SEQ
   ID NO:4 (FIG. 2A), and a heavy chain variable region that is the same as or differs by no
   more than 10 amino acids, 5 amino acids, 3 amino acids, or 1 amino acid from the
   sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 (FIG. 2B).
            In one embodiment, an anti-VLA- 1 antibody has a light chain sequence that is the
10 same as or differs by no more than 10 amino acids, 5 amino acids, 3 amino acids, or
   1 amino acid from the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 (FIG. 3) and a heavy chain sequence
   that is the same as or differs by no more than 10 amino acids, 5 amino acids, 3 amino
   acids, or 1 amino acid from the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 (FIG. 4).
            As discussed herein, exemplary anti-VLA- 1 antibodies useful in the methods
15 described herein include the antibodies described in U.S. Patent No. 7,358,054, which is
   incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Antibodies described in U.S. Patent
   No. 7,358,054, include, for example, monoclonal antibody AJH10 (ATCC PTA-3580;
   deposited on August 2, 2001, with the American Type Culture Collection, 10801
   University Boulevard, Manassas, VA 20110-2209), hAQC2 (ATCC PTA-3275;
20 deposited on April 18, 2001), haAQC2 (ATCC PTA-3274; deposited on April 18, 2001),
   hsAQC2 (ATCC PTA-3356; deposited on May 4, 2001) and mAQC2 (ATCC
   PTA-3273). All of these antibodies were deposited under the Budapest Treaty.
            In one embodiment, an anti-VLA- 1 antibody useful for the methods described
   herein includes a light chain polypeptide comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO:4
25 (FIG. 2A), and a heavy chain polypeptide comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO:5
   (FIG. 2B).
            In one embodiment, an anti-VLA- 1 antibody has a light chain sequence
   comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 (FIG. 3) and a heavy chain sequence
   comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 (FIG. 4). Other anti-VLA- 1 antibodies
30 include, e.g., monoclonal antibody 1B3 (ATCC HB-10536) described in U.S. Patent
   Nos. 5,391,481 and 5,788,966, and Ha3l/8.
                                                99

            In one embodiment, an anti-VLA- 1 antibody inhibits the interaction between
   VLA-1 and a VLA-1 ligand (e.g., collagen), such as by physically blocking the
   interaction, decreasing the affinity of VLA- 1 for its counterpart, disrupting or
   destabilizing VLA- 1 complexes, sequestering VLA- 1, or targeting VLA- 1 for
 5 degradation. In one embodiment, the antibody can bind to VLA- 1 at one or more amino
   acid residues that participate in the VLA- 1/ligand binding interface. Such amino acid
   residues can be identified, e.g., by alanine scanning. In another embodiment, the
   antibody can bind to residues that do not participate in the VLA-1/ligand binding. For
   example, the antibody can alter a conformation of VLA- 1 and thereby reduce binding
10 affinity, or the antibody may sterically hinder VLA- 1/ligand binding. In one
   embodiment, the antibody can reduce activation of a VLA- 1-mediated event or activity.
           Administration
            The anti-VLA- 1 antibody formulations described herein can be administered to a
15 subject, such as a human subject, by a variety of methods. Typically, administration is by
   subcutaneous injection.
            The formulation can be administered as a fixed dose, or in a mg/kg dose.
   Typically the administration is in a fixed dose. For example, the formulation is
   administered at a fixed unit dose of anti-VLA-1 antibody of about 80 mg to about 315 mg
20 (for example, about 100 mg, about 110 mg, about 120 mg, about 130 mg, about 140 mg,
   about 150 mg, about 160 mg, about 180 mg, about 190 mg, about 210 mg, about 250 mg,
   or about 300 mg) of anti-VLA- 1 antibody daily, twice per week, weekly, every two
   weeks, every 4 weeks (for example, monthly).
            The formulation can also be administered to a subject, such as a human, in a bolus
25 at a dose of anti-VLA- 1 antibody of about 2.0 mg per kg of body weight to about 4.0 mg
   per kg of body weight (for example, about 2.1 mg per kg of body weight, about 2.2 mg
   per kg of body weight, about 2.3 mg per kg of body weight, about 2.5 mg per kg of body
   weight, about 2.8 mg per kg of body weight, about 3.0 mg per kg of body weight, about
   3.1 mg per kg of body weight, about 3.2 mg per kg of body weight, about 3.3 mg per kg
30 of body weight, about 3.4 mg per kg of body weight, or about 3.6 mg per kg of body
   weight).
                                                100

           Modified dose ranges include a dose of anti-VLA- 1 antibody that is less than
   about 400 mg/subject, less than about 300 mg/subject, less than about 250 mg/subject,
   less than about 200 mg/subject, less than about 150 mg/subject or less than about 100
   mg/subject, typically for administration every fourth week or once a month. The
 5 anti VLA-1 antibody can be administered, for example, every three to five weeks, for
   example, every fourth week, or monthly.
           Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the desired response, such as a
   therapeutic response. As used herein, a "regimen" is a course of therapy regulated by a
   set course of drug administration. For example, the course of therapy can include
10 administration of a specific amount of drug on specific days at defined intervals. The
   dosages can be consistent or varied, and the period of administration can be at regular
   intervals (such as daily or every two or three days), or the period of administration can
   vary (for example, every day for one week, then no drug for a week, then drug every
   other day as needed for pain).
15         A "therapeutic response" is an improvement in a condition, symptom, or
   parameter associated with a disorder, to either a statistically significant degree or to a
   degree detectable to one skilled in the art.
           The dose of anti-VLA- 1 antibody can be chosen to reduce or avoid production of
   antibodies against the anti-VLA-1 antibody, to achieve greater than 40%, greater than
20 50%, greater than 70%, greater than 75%, or greater than 80% saturation of the al
   subunit, to achieve to less than 80%, less than 70%, less than 60%, less than 50%, or less
   than 40% saturation of the al subunit, or to prevent an increase the level of circulating
   white blood cells.
           Dosage unit form or "fixed dose" as used herein refers to physically discrete units
25 suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined
   quantity of active antibody calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in
   association with the required pharmaceutical carrier and optionally in association with the
   other agent.
           A pharmaceutical composition may include a "therapeutically effective amount"
30 of an anti-VLA-1 antibody described herein, such as SAN-300. Such effective amounts
   can be determined based on the effect of the administered agent, or the combinatorial
                                                101

   effect of an agent and secondary agent if more than one agent is used. A therapeutically
   effective amount of an agent may also vary according to factors such as the disease state,
   age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the antibody to elicit a desired
   response in the individual, such as amelioration of at least one disorder parameter, for
 5 example, a parameter of rheumatoid arthritis, or amelioration of at least one symptom of
   the disorder, for example, rheumatoid arthritis. A therapeutically effective amount is also
   one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the composition are outweighed by the
   therapeutically beneficial effects.
10         Devices and Kits
           Formulations having a high concentration of an anti-VLA- 1 antibody (for
   example, SAN-300) can be administered with a medical device. The device can be
   designed with or have features such as portability, room temperature storage, and ease of
   use so that it can be used in emergency situations, such as by an untrained subject or by
15 emergency personnel in the field, removed to medical facilities and other medical
   equipment. The device can be a container that includes, for example, one or more
   housings for storing pharmaceutical preparations that include an anti-VLA- 1 antibody

           A container, such as a delivery device, can contain a unit dosage formulation of
20 anti-VLA-1 antibody. The container can be suitable for subcutaneous administration.
   For example, the container can be a syringe.
           A pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti-VLA-1 antibody can be
   administered with a delivery device, such as a syringe, for example, a hypodermic or
   multichamber syringe. In one embodiment, the device is a prefilled syringe with an
25 attached or integral needle. In other embodiments, the device is a prefilled syringe not
   having a needle attached. The needle can be packaged with the prefilled syringe. In one
   embodiment, the device is an auto-injection device, such as an auto-injector syringe. In
   another embodiment the injection device is a pen-injector. In yet another embodiment,
   the syringe is a staked needle syringe, luer lock syringe, or luer slip syringe.  Other
30 suitable delivery devices include stents, catheters, microneedles, and implantable
   controlled release devices. The composition can be administered intravenously with
                                                102

   standard IV equipment, including, for example, IV tubings, with or without in-line filters.
   In certain embodiments, the device will be a syringe for use in SC or IM administration.
            An anti-VLA- 1 antibody, such as SAN-300, can be provided in a kit. In one
   embodiment, the kit includes one or more of: a container, such as in an injection device,
 5 such as a syringe that contains an antibody composition described herein; packaging
   material that encloses the container, and optionally, other elements of the kit; a container
   that contains a composition including a second agent; and informational material. The
   informational material can be descriptive, instructional, marketing or other material that
   relates to the methods described herein and/or the use of the agents for therapeutic
10 benefit. In one embodiment, the kit also includes a second agent. For example, the kit
   includes a first container that contains a composition that includes the anti-VLA-1
   antibody, and a second container that includes the second agent. In one embodiment, the
   kit includes one or more single-use syringes pre-filled with a high concentration liquid
   antibody formulation described herein.
15          The informational material of the kits is not limited in its form. In one
   embodiment, the informational material can include information about production of the
   antibody, concentration, date of expiration, batch or production site information, and so
   forth. In one embodiment, the informational material relates to methods of administering
   the anti-VLA- 1 antibody, such as SAN-300, such as in a suitable dose, dosage form, or
20 mode of administration, for example, a dose, dosage form, or mode of administration
   described herein, to treat a subject who has an inflammatory disease such as RA, or who
   is at risk for experiencing an episode associated with an inflammatory disease. The
   information can be provided in a variety of formats, including printed text, computer
   readable material, video recording, or audio recording, or information that provides a link
25 or address to substantive material.
            The kit can include one or more containers for the composition or compositions

            Rheumatoid Arthritis
            Formulations having anti-VLA- 1 antibody suitable for subcutaneous
   administration are useful for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmune
   arthritis, for example, rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis; or other forms of
20 inflammatory arthritis, such as arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
   Autoimmune arthritis is caused by abnormalities in the immune system that cause the
   body to start attacking its own joints and connective tissue. Examples of autoimmune
   arthritis include rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing
   spondylitis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic syndrome characterized by non-specific,
25 usually symmetric inflammation of the peripheral joints, potentially resulting in
   progressive destruction of articular and periarticular structures, with or without
   generalized manifestations. Juvenile arthritis (arthritis beginning at or before age 16) is
   similar to adult rheumatoid arthritis, and tends to affect large and small joints, and may
   affect growth and development. Psoriatic arthritis, which occurs in about 7% of psoriasis
30 patients, is an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis of the skin or nails; and a
                                                104

   negative test for RF (Rheumatoid factor). Ankylosing spondylitis is a systemic rheumatic
   disorder characterized by inflammation of the axial skeleton and large peripheral joints.
            Other types of arthritis, particularly inflammatory arthritis, are suited for
   treatment by the methods featured in the invention. For example, arthritis associated with
 5 inflammatory bowel disease can be treated with an anti-VLA- 1 antibody, such as when a
   first-line therapy fails or ceases to relieve arthritic symptoms.
            Efficacy of an agent for treatment of arthritis may be measured by a number of
   available diagnostic tools, including but not limited to, for example, physical
   examination, including assaying the number of tender joint counts or swollen joint
10 counts, joint X-rays, blood tests, or examination of fluid collected from affected joints.
   X-rays can reveal erosions, cysts and joint space narrowing that can occur in chronic
   rheumatoid arthritis. Blood tests that indicate elevated ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation
   Rate) levels or the presence of antibodies to altered y-globulin (i.e., rheumatic factors,
   "RFs") are indicative of rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial fluid from joints of patients with
15 rheumatoid arthritis is typically cloudy but sterile with reduced viscosity and usually
   3,000 to 50,000 white blood cells (WBCs)/ pL.
            Symptoms of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis, include joint pain, joint
   swelling, joint deformities, reduced ability to move a joint, redness of the skin around a
   joint, stiffness, warmth around a joint, morning stiffness, and effusion (collection of
20 liquid in the joints). Criteria for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is set forth in, for
   example, Aletaha et al., "2010 Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria," Arthritis
   and Rheumatism 62:2569-2581, 2010, and involves the assessment of the number of large
   and small joints affected in a subject, the levels of RF (rheumatoid factor) and ACPA
   (anti-citrullinated protein antibody) in serum, CRP (C-reactive protein) and ESR
25 (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) levels, and whether the subject's symptoms have
   persisted for at least six weeks, or for less than six weeks. The duration of symptoms is
   determined by the patient's self-report of the duration of signs and symptoms of synovitis
   (pain, swelling, and tenderness) of any joint that is clinically involved at the time of
   assessment. Each of these factors provides a score, and a total score > 6 (on a scale of
30 0-10), is indicative of rheumatoid arthritis.
                                                  105

           "Large joints" include shoulders, elbows, hips, knees and ankles, and "small
   joints" include metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal (PIP), second through
   fifth metatarsophalangeal (MTP), and thumb interphalangeal (IP) joints, and the wrists.
           RF and ACPA levels are usually reported in IU (International Units). Based on
 5 the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the respective laboratory test and assay the following
   definitions can be made: negative = less than or equal to the ULN for the laboratory test
   and assay; low-level positive = higher than the ULN but < 3 times the ULN for the
   laboratory test and assay; high-level positive = > 3 times the ULN for the laboratory test
   and assay.
10         CRP and ESR levels are scored as normal or abnormal based on the local
   laboratory standards. If results of at least one of these two tests are abnormal, the patient
   is scored as having an abnormal acute response.
           Patients having arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, also often have an increased
   level of VLA-1 cells, such as VLA-1 T cells or monocytes.
15         An "effective amount" of a therapy, such as a first line or second therapy, is an
   amount sufficient to cause beneficial or desired clinical results. An effective amount can
   be delivered in one or more administrations. An "effective amount" of a first line
   therapeutic will produce an "adequate response." An "adequate response" is manifested
   as an improvement in symptoms, such as a decrease in swollen joint count and/or tender
20 joint count, or a decrease in joint pain. An "effective amount" of an anti-VLA-1 antibody
   is an amount sufficient to palliate, ameliorate, stabilize, reverse, slow or delay
   progression of arthritis, or a symptom of arthritis, in accordance with clinically
   acceptable standards.
           A subject can be monitored for improvements in arthritic symptoms following
25 treatment with an anti-VLA- 1 antibody as a first line therapy or as a second line therapy.
   In one embodiment, a patient is administered a high concentration anti-VLA- 1 antibody
   formulation, after failing to respond, or after having an inadequate response to a first line
   therapy. An "inadequate response" is manifested as failure to achieve an improvement in
   symptoms, such as failure to experience a decrease in swollen joint count and/or tender
30 joint count, or a decrease in joint pain.
                                                 106

            A subject can be monitored for improvements in arthritic symptoms upon
   treatment with a first or second-line therapy. For example, a subject can be monitored by
   assaying an ACR (American College of Rheumatology) score. For example, a score of
   ACR20 indicates that there is at least a 20% reduction in the total number of tender and
 5 swollen joints and a reduction of 20% in three of the following five parameters:
   physician global assessment of disease, patient global assessment of disease, patient
   assessment of pain, C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and degree of
   disability in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score. Typically, a score of
   ACR20 indicates that a patient has significant improvement of arthritic symptoms
10 following administration of a therapeutic agent, such as an anti-VLA- 1 antibody or a first
   line therapy that is a drug other than an anti-VLA- 1 antibody. A patient can exhibit more
   significant improvements with scores of ACR50 or ACR70, for example.
            If a patient does not demonstrate a score of at least ACR20, for example, ACR20,
   ACR50 or ACR70, following administration of a therapy, then the patient can receive a
15 negative assessment, or be determined to have an inadequate response to the therapy. In
   some embodiments, the patient's ACR score is monitored over the course of one or two
   weeks, or one or two months, or longer. In some embodiments, a patient will not meet a
   predetermined criterion that requires an ACR score of ACR20, ARC50, or ACR70 after
   treatment with a first line therapy, and the patient will be selected for treatment with an
20 anti-VLA-1 antibody.
            The HAQ is a validated questionnaire, self-administered by the patient, that
   includes twenty items relating to function and four items relating to aids and devices. The
   questions include eight subscales: dressing and grooming, arising, hygiene, reach, eating,
   walking, grip, and activities. Items are scored from 0 (able to function without difficulty)
25 to 3 (unable to function). The HAQ disease index is a weighted sum of the scale scores,
   with a higher score indicating poorer function. Decreases in the HAQ disease index
   exceeding -0.19 to -0.22 (e.g., -0.2 or -0.21) are considered to be clinically important.
            If a patient does not exhibit an improvement (an increase) in HAQ score by at
   least 0.19, for example, by at least 0.22 or more, following administration of a therapy,
30 then the patient can receive a negative assessment, or be determined to have an
                                                107

   inadequate response to the therapy. In some embodiments, the patient is monitored for an
   improvement in HAQ over the course of one or two weeks, or one or two months, or
   longer. In some embodiments, a patient will not meet a predetermined criterion that
   requires an improvement in HAQ score of at least 0.19 or at least 0.22 or more, and the
 5 patient will be selected for treatment with an anti-VLA- 1 antibody.
            A patient can also be monitored for improvements in arthritic symptoms upon
   treatment with a first or second-line therapy by assaying for an improvement in DAS
   (Disease Activity Score). DAS is a measure of the activity of rheumatoid arthritis that
   incorporates the following parameters: the total number of tender and swollen joints,
10 ESR, and patient assessment of disease activity (Van der Heijde et al., "Development of
   disease activity score based on judgment in clinical practice by rheumatologists" J.
   Rheumatol. 20:579-81, 1993). If a patient does not exhibit an improvement in DAS, for
   example, a decrease in DAS by at least 1.6, at least 1.8, at least 2.0, at least 2.5, at
   least 3.0, at least 3.2, at least 3.6, or more, following administration of a therapy, then the
15 patient can receive a negative assessment, or be determined to have an inadequate
   response to the therapy. In some embodiments, the patient is monitored for an
   improvement in DAS over the course of one or two weeks, or one or two months, or
   longer. In some embodiments, a patient will not meet a predetermined criterion that
   requires an improvement in DAS (a decrease in DAS) by at least 1.6, at least 2.0, at
20 least 2.2, at least 2.8, at least 3.2, at least 3.6, or more, and the patient will be selected for
   treatment with an anti-VLA- 1 antibody. Typically, a DAS score of 2.6 or less indicates
   remission of RA, and a DAS score of 3.2 or less indicates low disease activity. In one
   embodiment, patient will not meet a predetermined criterion that is a DAS of 2.6 or less,
   or a patient will not meet a predetermined criterion that is a DAS of 3.2 or less.
25          The DAS for 28-joint counts (DAS28-CRP measure) includes a composite of
   4 variables: number of tender joints out of 28 joints, number of swollen joints out of
   28 joints, CRP (in mg/L), and subject assessment of disease activity measure on a Visual
   Analogue Scale (VAS) of 100 millimeters (mm). DAS28-CRP values range from 0 to
   9.31, with higher scores indicating more disease activity. Typically, a DAS28-CRP score
30 of 2.6 or less indicates remission of RA, and a DAS28-CRP score or 3.2 or less indicates
   low disease activity. In one embodiment, patient will not meet a predetermined criterion
                                                     108

   that is a DAS of 2.6 or less, or a patient will not meet a predetermined criterion that is a
   DAS28 of 3.2 or less.
            A patient can also be monitored for improvements in arthritic symptoms by a
   count of the total number of tender and swollen joints. If the total number of tender and
 5 swollen joints does not decrease by, for example, more than 1, 2, 3 or more following
   administration of a therapy, then the patient can receive a negative assessment, or be
   determined to have an inadequate response to the therapy. In some embodiments, the
   patient is monitored for a decrease in swollen or tender joint counts over the course of
   one or two weeks, or one or two months, or longer. In some embodiments, a patient will
10 not meet a predetermined criterion that requires a decrease in swollen or tender joint
   count of 1, 2, 3 or more, and the patient will be selected for treatment with an anti-VLA- 1
   antibody. In some embodiments, a patient will not meet a predetermined criterion that
   requires a decrease in swollen or tender joint count of 15%, 20%, or 30% or more, and
   the patient will be selected for treatment with an anti-VLA- 1 antibody.
15          A patient can also be monitored for improvements in arthritic symptoms by
   radiographic methods, such as MRI, ultrasound or X-ray. These methods provide images
   that can reveal the extent of synovitis, erosive changes, and edema. Failure to see a
   decrease in the extent of synovitis, a decrease in the rate of erosion in the joint, or a
   decrease in edema, such as over the course of one or two weeks or one or two months, or
20 longer, for example, can indicate that the patient has an inadequate response to a therapy.
   In some embodiments, a patient will not meet a predetermined criterion that requires a
   decrease in the extent of synovitis, a decrease in the rate of erosion in the joint, or a
   decrease in "bone edema" or "osteitis" by 15%, 20%, 30% or more, and the patient will
   be selected for treatment with an anti-VLA- 1 antibody.
25          A patient can also be monitored for improvements in arthritic symptoms upon
   treatment with a first or second-line therapy by assaying for the number of VLA- 1 cells,
   for example, VLA- 1 T cells or monocytes, in blood or synovial fluid. If the number of
   VLA-1 cells does not decrease by, for example, more than 15%, more than 20% or more
   than 30% or more following administration of a therapy, then the patient can receive a
30 negative assessment, or be determined to have an inadequate response to the therapy. In
                                                109

   some embodiments, the patient is monitored for a decrease in VLA- 1 cells over the
   course of one or two weeks, or one or two months, or longer. In some embodiments, a
   patient will not meet a predetermined criterion that requires a decrease in VLA- 1 cells of
   15%, 20%, 30% or more, and the patient will be selected for treatment with an anti
 5 VLA-1 antibody.
           In some embodiments, a patient will not meet a predetermined criterion that
   requires an improvement in both tender and swollen joint counts of at least 15%, at least
   20%, at least 30% or more, and an improvement of at least 15%, at least 20%, or at least
   30% or more in three of the remaining five core measures: patient's assessment of pain
10 (on the basis of a visual-analogue scale ranging from 1 to 100, with higher scores
   indicating more pain); levels of acute-phase reactants, such as CRP level; HAQ score;
   and patient and physician global assessment (each assessed on a scale of 0 to 100, with
   higher numbers indicating more severe disease).
           Information regarding a patient's response to a first-line therapy can be acquired
15 directly or indirectly. For example, information regarding the patient's response can be
   assessed by a clinician or caregiver who directly examines the patient for symptom
   improvements following administration of a first-line therapy. Alternatively, the
   information can be acquired indirectly, such as from patient records obtained from the
   records of a hospital or clinic, or clinician or caregiver, or from a database, such as an
20 on-line database.
           "Acquire" or "acquiring" as the terms are used herein, refer to obtaining
   possession of a physical entity, or a value, such as a numerical value, by "directly
   acquiring" or "indirectly acquiring" the physical entity or value. "Directly acquiring"
   means performing a process (for example, examining the patient or a patient sample) to
25 obtain the physical entity or value. "Indirectly acquiring" refers to receiving the physical
   entity or value from another party or source (for example, a third party laboratory that
   directly acquired the physical entity or value).
           Directly acquiring a physical entity includes performing a process that includes a
   physical change in a physical substance, such as a starting material. Exemplary changes
30 include making a physical entity from two or more starting materials, shearing or
                                                 110

   fragmenting a substance, separating or purifying a substance, combining two or more
   separate entities into a mixture, performing a chemical reaction that includes breaking or
   forming a covalent or non-covalent bond.
           Directly acquiring a value includes performing a process that includes a physical
 5 change in a sample or another substance, for example, performing an analytical process
   which includes a physical change in a substance, such as a sample, an analyte, or a
   reagent (sometimes referred to herein as "physical analysis"), performing an analytical
   method, such as a method that includes one or more of the following: separating or
   purifying a substance, such as an analyte, or a fragment or other derivative thereof, from
10 another substance; combining an analyte, or fragment or other derivative thereof, with
   another substance, such as a buffer, a solvent, or a reactant; or changing the structure of
   an analyte, or a fragment or other derivative thereof, such as by breaking or forming a
   covalent or non-covalent bond, between a first and a second atom of the analyte; or by
   changing the structure of a reagent, or a fragment or other derivative thereof, such as by
15 breaking or forming a covalent or non-covalent bond, between a first and a second atom
   of the reagent.
           "Analyzing" a sample includes performing a process that involves a physical
   change in a sample or another substance, such as a starting material. Exemplary changes
   include making a physical entity from two or more starting materials, shearing or
20 fragmenting a substance, separating or purifying a substance, combining two or more
   separate entities into a mixture, performing a chemical reaction that includes breaking or
   forming a covalent or non-covalent bond. Analyzing a sample can include performing an
   analytical process which includes a physical change in a substance, such as a sample, an
   analyte, or a reagent (sometimes referred to herein as "physical analysis"), performing an
25 analytical method, such as a method which includes one or more of the following:
   separating or purifying a substance, such as an analyte, or a fragment or other derivative
   thereof, from another substance; combining an analyte, or fragment or other derivative
   thereof, with another substance, such as a buffer, a solvent, or a reactant; or changing the
   structure of an analyte, or a fragment or other derivative thereof, such as by breaking or
30 forming a covalent or non-covalent bond, between a first and a second atom of the
   analyte; or by changing the structure of a reagent, or a fragment or other derivative
                                                111

   thereof, such as by breaking or forming a covalent or non-covalent bond, between a first
   and a second atom of the reagent.
            In one embodiment, determining whether a patient has improvements in arthritic
   symptoms, includes one or more of evaluating the patient, or analyzing a sample from the
 5 patient, requesting evaluation of the patient or analysis of the sample, requesting results
   from evaluation of the patient or analysis of the sample, or receiving the results from
   evaluation of the patient or analysis of the sample. Generally, analysis can include one or
   both of performing the underlying method, for example, assaying for the number of
   VLA- 1 cells or monocytes in a patient sample, or receiving data from another who has
10 performed the underlying method.
            In addition to or prior to human studies, an animal model can be used to evaluate
   the efficacy of using the two agents. An exemplary animal model for RA is described in
   U.S. 7,358,054. For example, in an arthritis model in mice, anti-collagen type II
15 antibodies are administered by i.p. injection, followed by i.p. injection of LPS
   (lipopolysaccharide). Mice develop symptoms such as swollen wrists, ankles and digits.
            Other Disorders
            The formulations and methods described herein can also be used to treat other
20 inflammatory, immune, or autoimmune disorders, such as tissue or organ graft rejection
   or graft-versus-host disease; acute CNS injury, such as stroke or spinal cord injury;
   chronic renal disease; an allergy, such as allergic asthma; type 1 diabetes; inflammatory
   bowel disorders, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; myasthenia gravis;
   fibromyalgia; an arthritic disorder, such as psoriatic arthritis; an inflammatory/immune
25 skin disorders, such as psoriasis, vitiligo, dermatitis, and lichen planus; systemic lupus
   erythematosus; Sjogren's Syndrome; a hematological cancer, such as multiple myeloma,
   leukemia, and lymphoma; a solid cancer, such as a sarcoma or carcinoma, such as of the
   lung, breast, prostate, or brain; and a fibrotic disorder, such as pulmonary fibrosis,
   myelofibrosis, liver cirrhosis, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, crescentic
30 glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, and renal interstitial fibrosis.
                                                 112

           For example, a formulation containing a high concentration of anti-VLA- 1
   antibody, such as SAN-300, can be administered subcutaneously to treat these and other
   inflammatory, immune, or autoimmune disorders.
           Exemplary second agents
 5         In some cases, the formulations described herein, for example, formulations
   containing an anti-VLA- 1 antibody suitable for SC administration, are administered in
   combination with a formulation containing a second agent. Typically, the anti-VLA- 1
   antibody formulation, and the formulation containing the second agent are separate
   formulations.
10         In one implementation, the antibody and the second agent are provided as
   separate formulations, and the step of administering includes sequentially administering
   the antibody and the second agent. The sequential administrations can be provided on the
   same day, for example, within one hour of one another or at least 3 hours, at least
   6 hours, or at least 12 hours apart, or on different days. The second agent can be
15 administered before administration of an anti-VLA- 1 antibody or antigen-binding
   fragment thereof, after administration of an anti-VLA- 1 antibody or antigen-binding
   fragment thereof, or at the same time as administration of an anti-VLA- 1 antibody or
   antigen-binding fragment thereof.
           Generally, the antibody and the second agent are each administered as a plurality
20 of doses separated in time. The antibody and the second agent are generally each
   administered according to a regimen. The regimen for one or both may have a regular
   periodicity. The regimen for the antibody can have a different periodicity from the
   regimen for the second agent, for example, one can be administered more frequently than
   the other. In one implementation, one of the antibody and the second agent is
25 administered once weekly and the other is administered once monthly. The antibody and
   the second agent can be administered by any appropriate method, for example,
   subcutaneously.
           In some embodiments, each of the antibody and the second agent is administered
   at the same dose as each is prescribed for monotherapy. In other embodiments, the
30 antibody is administered at a dosage that is equal to or less than an amount required for
                                                113

   efficacy if administered alone. Likewise, the second agent can be administered at a
   dosage that is equal to or less than an amount required for efficacy if administered alone.
           The second agent can be, for example, an anti-inflammatory, an antihistamine, an
   analgesic, such as acetaminophen, or a corticosteroid.
 5         Non-limiting examples of second agents for treating rheumatoid arthritis in
   combination with an anti-VLA- 1 antibody include a DMARD, such as gold salts;
   hydroxychloroquine; an antifolate, such as methotrexate; a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor,
   such as leflunomide; or a sulfa drug, such as sulfasalazine. In another embodiment, the
   second agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis is a TNF-a inhibitor, such as an anti-TNF-a
10 antibody, for example, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, or golimumab; or
   etanercept.
           Other exemplary second agents include a JAK (Janus Kinase) inhibitor (e.g., a
   JAKI, JAK2, JAK3 or TYK2 inhibitor), a SYK (Spleen Tyrosine Kinase) inhibitor) (for
   example, an inhibitor of SYK or ZAP-70), a VLA-2 inhibitor, an IL-6 inhibitor, an IL-17
15 inhibitor, an IL- 12/IL-23 inhibitor, a MAdCAM- 1 inhibitor, a CD20 inhibitor or another
   biologic agent. For example, the second therapeutic agent can be methotrexate,
   leflunomide, sulfasalazine, or hydroxychloroquine, infliximab, adalimumab,
   certolizumab pegol, golimumab, etanercept, rituximab, tocilizumab or abatacept.
           The second agent can be, for example, an inhibitor of JAK3, such as the small
20 molecule inhibitor CP-690,550 (tofacitinib), or the second agent can be the SYK
   inhibitor R406, or its prodrug R788.
           The second agent can alternatively be a B cell-depleting agent, such as an
   anti-CD20 antibody, for example rituximab (Rituxan, Genentech, Inc., South San
   Francisco, CA; and IDEC Pharmaceutical, San Diego, CA), an anti-VLA-2 antibody,
25 such as GBR 500; or an anti-MAdCAM-1 antibody, such as vedolizumab.
           Non-limiting examples of second agents for treating IBD in combination with an
   anti-VLA- 1 antibody include, for example, an anti-MAdCAM- 1 antibody, such as
   vedolizumab.
           In one embodiment, the second therapeutic agent is methotrexate, administered at
30 a dose of about 35 mg/week, about 30 mg/week, about 25 mg/week, about 20 mg/week,
   or about 15 mg/week, or less. In another embodiment, the second therapeutic agent is
                                               114

   leflunomide, administered at a dose of about 30 mg/day, about 25 mg/day, about
   20 mg/day, about 15 mg/day, about 10 mg/day or less. In another embodiment the
   second therapeutic agent is sulfasalazine, administered at a dose of about 4000 mg/day,
   about 3500 mg/day, about 3000 mg/day, about 2500 mg/day, about 2000 mg/day, or less.
 5 In another embodiment, the second therapeuctic agent is hydroxychloroquine,
   administered at a dose of about 500 mg/day, about 450 mg/day, about 400 mg/day, about
   350 mg/day, about 300 mg/day or less.
            In one embodiment, the patient is administered a third therapeutic agent, which
   can be, for example, methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine,
10 infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, golimumab, etanercept, rituximab,
   tocilizumab or abatacept.
            In one embodiment, administration of the first and second, and optionally the
   third, therapeutic agents results in a greater improvement of symptoms than is observed
   following administration of either the first or the second (or third) therapeutic agents
15 alone.
            In some embodiments, a subject is treated with one or more therapeutic agents
   prior to receiving an anti-VLA- 1 antibody therapy, such as an infusion of an anti-VLA- 1
   therapy, such as to prevent or ameliorate adverse reactions to the anti-VLA- 1
   administration, for example, to prevent or ameliorate adverse events associated with
20 infusion of an anti-VLA- 1 antibody. Exemplary pre-treatment regimens include, for
   example treatment with one or more of an analgesic, such as acetaminophen, an
   antihistamine, or a steroid, such as a corticosteroid, such as methylprednisolone. In one
   embodiment, a subject, such as an RA patient is administered acetaminophen and an
   antihistamine prior to administration of an anti-VLA- 1 antibody, such as prior to infusion
25 with an anti-VLA-1 antibody. In one embodiment, an RA patient is administered a
   corticosteroid (also called a glucocorticoid), such as methylprednisolone, prior to
   treatment with an anti-VLA- 1 antibody.
            In one embodiment, the pretreatment, such as the corticosteroid, such as
   methylprednisolone, is administered at a dose of about 50 mg/75 kg human, about 75
30 mg/75 mg human, about 100 mg/75 kg human, about 125 mg/75 kg human, or about
   150 mg/75 kg human.
                                                 115

           In another embodiment, the pretreatment is administered for about 15 minutes to
   about one hour or more, for example, about 15 minutes, about 30 minutes, about 45
   minutes, or about one hour or more prior to administration of the anti-VLA- 1 antibody,
   such as prior to infusion of the anti-VLA- 1 antibody.
 5         The pretreatment can be administered, for example, by intravenous delivery, such
   as by infusion.
           In some embodiments, a second agent may be used to treat one or more symptoms
   or side effects of RA.
           In addition to a second agent, it is also possible to deliver still other agents to the
10 subject. However, in some embodiments, no protein or biologic agent, other than the
   anti-VLA-1 antibody and second agent, are administered to the subject as a
   pharmaceutical composition. The anti-VLA-1 antibody and the second agent may be the
   only agents that are delivered by injection. In embodiments in which the anti-VLA- 1
   antibody and the second agent are recombinant proteins, the anti-VLA- 1 antibody and
15 second agent may be the only recombinant agents administered to the subject, or at least
   the only recombinant agents that modulate immune or inflammatory responses. In still
   other embodiments, the anti-VLA- 1 antibody alone is the only recombinant agent or the
   only biologic administered to the subject.

            Example 1. Biophysical characteristics of the anti-VLA-1 antibody were
25  evaluated in various antibody formulations.
            Biophysical characteristics of the anti-VLA-1 antibody were examined to,
   inter alia,determine the thermal and conformational stability of the antibody in the
   presence of various buffers and excipients.

            The buffers listed in Table 1 were evaluated to assess the conformational stability
   of SAN-300.

            The target protein concentration for the biophysical studies was 2 mg/mL. The
   protein samples were buffer exchanged using Amicon Ultra-4 (30k MWCO, RC
   Membrane) concentrators into the buffers listed in Table 1. The protein concentration in
   the samples was measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of
10 1.53 mL/mg*cm. For the initial biophysical screening, thermal and conformational
   stability of the protein in various buffers was determined using differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). DSC measures denaturation,
   melting temperature and enthalpy. DLS provides a measure of aggregation. The samples
   were analyzed at 2 mg/mL in the various formulation buffers. The final volume for each
15 formulation was ~1.0 mL (-24 mg of protein for the entire study).
            The DSC data is summarized in Table 2. The formulations A-L in Table 2 are
   provided in order of increasing pH. Glutamate did not provide clear peaks, see
   Formulation A, indicating that it is less desirable.

                 Generally, stability of the formulations increased with increased pH. A pH of 4.5
        or less was determined not to be optimal. No aggregation was observed in any of the
  5     buffer conditions, and the melting temperature was found to be > 50 0C (Tmi > 50 0C).
        Glutamate was determined to be the least favorable buffer, and citrate did not have
        clearly preferred properties.
                 Excipients screening. The conformational and thermal stability of formulations
 10     comprising SAN-300 and various excipients were assessed after exchange into the

               DSC data indicated that none of the excipients tested had a dramatic effect on
    melting temperature (Tml1). For all excipients, the melting temperature was >50 0 C. The
  freezing temperature in NaCl was lower, as expected, and the melting temperature in
    sugar and in the polyols was similar. Trehalose, mannitol and sucrose were less
    preferred. The polyol sorbitol and NaCl were more preferred.

               Sample Preparation.The protein samples were exchanged into the indicated
      buffers using Amicon Ultra-4 (30K MWCO) concentrators. The concentrators were pre
 5    rinsed with 3 mL of buffer followed by centrifugation at -3000 x g for 5 minutes. For
       each formulation, 1.7 mL SAN-300 (69 mg/mL) were diluted with 2.3 mL of the
       appropriate buffer in a rinsed concentrator, and the volume reduced to -2 mL by
       centrifugation at -3000 x g, resulting in a protein concentration of -60 mg/mL. This
      process was repeated for a total of four rounds of buffer exchange. Protein concentration
10     was then measured in duplicate by UV-Vis spectroscopy using disposable Eppendorf
       UVettes (1.0 cm pathlength) and an extinction coefficient of 1.53 mL/mg*cm. A 10 [tL

   volume of the concentrated samples was diluted in 990 [iL of the appropriate buffer to a
   concentration ~0.5 mg/mL.
           Samples were next concentrated at 3000 x g (or lower) until precipitation was
   observed or the sample volume was reduced by half, at which point the protein
 5 concentration was measured as described above with an appropriate increase in the
   dilution volume. Each sample was further concentrated and measured according to the
   table, or until precipitation was observed. Protein concentrations and percent recoveries
   were reported for each formulation. Approximately 1900 mg of protein were used for the
   entire study.

           The role of surfactant in reducing protein loss and minimizing aggregation was
   evaluated. Samples were analyzed by appearance, UV-Vis, DLS and SEC-HPLC to
   assess stability/aggregation in the stressed samples. The formulations used in the
15 surfactant studies are summarized in Table 7.

            Results. Surfactant was analysed for its effect on protein loss and aggregation.
   Polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) was assessed at two concentration levels for each of agitation
   and freeze/thaw.
 5          Agitation stress samples showed significant opalescence without Tween 80.
   Tween 80 was found to have an impact on agitation stress. The effect was not
   concentration dependent at the concentrations evaluated.
            Tween 80 had no impact on aggregation, at either concentration, in freeze/thaw.
            In SEC (size exclusion chromatography) studies, Tween 80 had no impact at
10 either concentration. Acetate and histidine had preferred buffering properties. Less
   aggregation was observed in acetate and histidine, and thus these were preferred buffers.
            In DLS studies, Tween 80 protected against the effects of agitation although the
   effect was independent of concentration at the concentrations studied. No effect of
   Tween was observed in freeze/thaw experiments, and sorbitol appeared to perform better.
15          Sample Preparation for Example 3. SAN-300 was formulated with and without
   Tween 80 (i.e., polysorbate 80) at a SAN-300 target concentration of -200 mg/mL. The
   protein samples were buffer exchanged using Amicon Ultra concentrators (30K MWCO,
   Ultracel Membrane, Cat# UFC 903008) into the buffer/excipient combinations
   (excluding surfactant) listed in table 7.
20          A total of -1600 mg (23 mL) of SAN-300 was used for each buffer/excipient
   combination and the volume was split into two concentrators which were diluted with the
   appropriate buffer to a volume of 15 mL. The samples were concentrated to -7.5 mL and
   diluted in the appropriate buffer to a total volume of 15mL. This process was repeated
   for a total of 4 cycles. The sample volumes were then reduced until the target
25 concentration (-2 mL per tube) was reached. The duplicate concentrates were pooled,
   and the protein content determined in duplicate by UV-Vis spectroscopy by diluting 50
                                                 124

   [tL into 49.95 mL of 0.9% SFI volumetrically and using an extinction coefficient of 1.53
   mL/mg*cm.
            The pooled samples were then split into three aliquots of 1.2 mL and Tween 80
   was spiked into the aliquoted samples at the specified concentration. The formulated
 5 samples were subjected to stress via freeze-thaw cycling and mechanical stress by
   agitation, in addition to a small aliquot reserved as a no-stress control (stored at 2-8 C)
   for SEC-HPLC analysis. For both forms of stress, 0.5 mL of sample were transferred to
   type 1 borosilicate glass vials (2 mL size). For freeze-thaw cycling, the sample was
   frozen at -80 'C for >90 minutes and then allowed to thaw to room temperature. This
10 was repeated for a total of 5 cycles. The sample was then stored at 2 'C to 8 'C until
   analysis. For agitation stress, the samples were placed on a microplate shaker for 24 to
   48 hours at room temperature. Samples were then stored at 2 'C to 8 'C until analysis.

15          The buffers in Table 8 were evaluated at 200 mg/mL SAN-300 for the
   preformulation DOE (Design of Experiments). Samples 1 to 28 were for evaluation of
   Tween 80. Samples 29 to 36 were generated to test the suitability of Tween-20 as an
   excipient. For the DOE, each axial pH sample was prepared in duplicate, with center
   point pH samples prepared in triplicate. For Tween-20 investigations, duplicate samples
20 were prepared at center point pHs.

            Results. One vial of each formulation was placed at 5 'C and one at 50 C (stress
   condition) for the 28 day incubation. Data collected after 28 days storage were analyzed
 5 for statistical significance.
            Acetate data sets indicated that a preferred formulation contains sorbitol and has a
   pH -5.50.
            Histidine data sets indicated that pH -6.00 is preferred. With the exception of
10 HPLC data, all other indicators supported sorbitol as a preferred excipient. The effects of
                                                 126

   sorbitol and NaCl in histidine samples were more similar than was observed for the
   acetate formulations.
             Size Exclusion data was essentially identical for NaCl and sorbitol, while the
   highly qualitative 50 'C CEX response data indicated that NaCl is a preferred excipient
 5 for histidine formulations. CEX chromatograms also indicated a higher level of
   degradation in the presence of acetate as compared to histidine.
            These conclusions were from formulations that contained the surfactant PS-80 at
   a concentration of about 0.01%. To evaluate the effect of an alternative surfactant, off
   DOE samples were prepared at center point pHs that contained about 0.0 1% PS-20.
10 Evaluation of the data revealed no clear difference between the two surfactant types, as
   indicated by SEC (size-exclusion chromatography), CEX (cation exchange
   chromatography), DSC, and UV-Vis methods. However, DLS and appearance testing
   results were less optimal with PS-20. Light scattering measurements of 30 mM acetate,
   150 mM NaCl, PS-20, pH 5.0, samples showed excessive polydispersity, which was not
15 observed in comparable PS-80-containing samples. Polydispersity, however, was evident
   in respective PS-80, acetate/NaCl samples at pH 4.5. Furthermore, during appearance
   testing at 4 weeks, it was observed that a total of 9 samples (out of 72) contained apparent
   particulate matter. Of these, six were PS-20 formulations ( -38% of 16 samples). Given
   no clear advantage of PS-20 over PS-80, the latter surfactant was preferred for carrying
20 on to further studies.
            The sorbitol-containing acetate formulation was slightly preferred over the
   histidine formulation under all conditions tested except HPLC. This favorability for
   acetate was primarily supported by DLS data. This data, however, also indicated that the
   preferred acetate formulation was predicted to have a higher percentage of aggregate
25 species (by -1%) relative to the preferred histidine formulation. The increased
   propensity for aggregate formation in acetate could alone be enough to support the
   histidine/sorbitol formulation in further studies. However, one advantage of the
   acetate/sorbitol formulation was its reduced viscosity. In further evaluation of SAN-300,
   this reduced viscosity could allow for higher concentration formulations in addition to
30 easing the burden on tangential flow filtration systems.
                                                127

            Thus, the following candidate formulations were selected for forced degradation
   and formulation development studies:
            1.  30 mM acetate, 250 mM sorbitol, 0.01% PS-80, pH 5.5 and
            2. 30 mM histidine, 250 mM sorbitol, 0.01% PS-80, pH 6.0.
 5
            Since for histidine formulations, polysorbate 20 results were similar to
   polysorbate 80, a histidine formulation was designed wherein polysorbate 20 was
   substituted for the polysorbate 80 to avoid any yellowing effect that sometimes occurs
   with polysorbate 80/Histidine formulations.
10          Sample Preparaton for Example 4. Samples were buffer exchanged and
   concentrated using Amicon-15 concentrators (Cat. # UFC903024). The concentrators
   were pre-rinsed with the appropriate buffer by adding 5 mL of buffer to the filter,
   followed by spinning at -3200 x g for 5 minutes. For each formulation, a total of 13 mL
   of SAN-300 (69 mg/mL) were split between duplicate Amicon-15 concentrators and
15 diluted to 15 mL with the appropriate formulation buffer. In the case of a single center
   point sample for each formulation, a total of 19.5 mL of SAN-300 were split between
   triplicate concentrators to account for the volume of sample necessary for osmolality and
   viscosity testing. Tween-20 formulations were prepared using 13 mL of SAN-300. For
   buffer exchange, the concentrators were centrifuged until the volume reached -7.5 mL,
20 and the samples were diluted with formulation buffer to 15 mL for a total of 4 rounds. A
   total of -33 g of protein was used for the study
            Following buffer exchange of SAN-300 into the various buffers, the samples were
   concentrated to < 1.5 mL, and the contents of duplicate (or triplicate) concentrators were
   pooled into a single fraction. A prior surfactant screening study showed a protein loss of
25 20-32% during an identical buffer exchange and concentration process. Assuming a
   worst-case 35% loss, the starting 13 mL of SAN-300 would produce -2.9 mL of
   200 mg/mL concentrate. Material was mixed by pipetting up and down prior to
   transferring to 15 mL conical tubes. The protein concentration in the samples was
   measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of 1.53 mL/mg*cm
30 and a pathlength of 1 cm. To dilute the samples to the target of -0.5 mg/mL, 50 piL of
   the concentrate was diluted into 25 mL of 0.9% NaCl volumetrically and in duplicate.
                                                128

   Duplicate A 280 readings must be within 5% of each other. A third dilution was prepared
   and measured where the A 280 readings were not within 5% of each other. The samples
   were diluted or further concentrated as necessary to achieve the target concentration of
   200 mg/mL +/- 10 mg/mL.
 5          Following achievement of 200 mg/mL concentrations for each formulation, the
   appropriate volume of 10% PS-80 (Surfact-Amps, Thermo-Fisher, C/N 28328) or 10%
   PS-20 (C/N 28320) was added to achieve a final concentration of about 0.01%. The
   formulations were sterile filtered using Millipore Ultrafree-CL GV 0.22 ptM sterile
   concentrators (Cat. # UFC40GV0S). To sterile filter, the entire volume of each
10 formulation was transferred to a separate sterile filter, only opening the top part of the
   filter. The Ultrafree-CL units were spun at -3200 x g for 5 minutes or until the entire
   solution had passed through the 0.22 [tM membrane. Following centrifugation, the
   filtering units were not reopened until the time of vialing, which was performed inside a
   biosafety cabinet (BSC).
15          Prior to vialing, -75 2.0 mL Vials (West Cat # 68000314) and a similar number
   of FluroTec stoppers (West Cat # 19500040) were triple rinsed in WFI (water for
   injection). Stoppers were double-bagged in autoclave bags and autoclaved to sterilize.
   Vials were dried in an oven at 80 'C. After drying, the basket of vials was double
   wrapped in tin foil then depyrogenated by heating at -200 'C.
20
            For vialing, a biosafety cabinet was used. Prior to use, the BSC was turned on for
   at least 15 minutes then sprayed down with 70% IPA. Sterile gloves and arm covers
   were also used. All items entering the hood were sprayed with 70% IPA prior to
   entering. Filter units containing sterile formulations were brought into the biosafety
25 cabinet. A minimum of 1.0 mL filling volume was used. There were 2 vials per
   formulation with the remainder to stay in the sterile filter to use as the Time Zero sample.
   Appearance at Time Zero was performed using one of the vials for each formulation prior
   to staging.

           Example 5A. Formulation Development Studies
           For formulation development, SAN-300 samples were evaluated for the following
   properties: syringeability, viscosity, osmolality, and filter compatibility.
 5         Syringeability Study. The syringeability of high-concentration SAN-300 was
   evaluated at the target concentration. For this study, a total of 10 mL was used for each
   candidate formulation. The force (pounds-force (lbf)) required to expel each solution was
   determined via use of Instron instrument using a 1 mL syringe and 25 G, 27 G, and 30 G
   needles. Each data point was performed in triplicate, with fresh sample used for each
10 measurement. Samples were expelled at a rate of 20 inches/minute (approximately
   10 mL/min) and collected in a glass vial. The post-expulsion samples were analyzed by
   DLS (undiluted), SEC, and appearance. A sample of pre-expulsion formulated material
   was analyzed as a control.
           Results of the syringeability study are shown in Table 13.

           Viscosity Measurements. Acetate/Sorbitol/PS-80 and Histidine/Sorbitol/PS-80
   samples (5'C) from the DOE were pooled together, regardless of pH. The samples were
   next diluted to 190 mg/mL and 180 mg/mL in the appropriate buffer, and the viscosities and
 5 protein content measured (Table 14).
           Viscosity for SAN-300 was measured using a Brookfield DV-1II Ultra
   Programmable Rheometer. Prior to sample measurement, viscometer performance was
   calibrated using a certified viscosity standard. Following the standard measurement,
10 0.5 mL of neat sample was loaded into the viscometer. The viscosity measurements were
   performed at multiple percentage torque values.
           Undiluted samples displayed non-Newtonian behavior, as evidenced by the small
   drop in viscosity at higher shear speeds. The behavior of both buffers becomes more
   Newtonian as SAN-300 is diluted.

             Example 5B. Forced Degradation Studies
10           Forced degradation studies of SAN-300 were performed to ensure the ability of
   analytical methods to detect and resolve potential degradation products in two different
   formulations. A total of 4.5 mL (9 x 0.5 mL vials) of concentrated SAN-300 was used
   per formulation.
15          Formulation Controls. For formulation controls, 1 vial of each SAN-300
   formulation was stored at 50 C for the duration of the photo stress study (see below),
   followed by storage at 2 0 C to 80 C until analysis.
                                                    132

           Freeze/Thaw Stress. For freeze/thaw studies, freezing was performed by placing
   1 vial of each SAN-300 formulation at -80'C for > 2 hours. The samples were thawed at
   room temperature and then returned to -80 'C for at least 90 minutes. Samples were
   exposed to 5 freeze/thaw cycles and then stored at 2 'C to 8'C until analysis.
 5
           Heat Stress. For heat-stress studies, 1 vial of each SAN-300 formulation was
   stored at 50 'C. After 1 week, the samples were pulled for testing. Pulled samples were
   stored at 2 'C to 8'C until analysis.
10         Photo Stress. Photostability studies were performed following ICH QIB
   guidelines for exposure of the product to cool white light and near UV light. One vial of
   each SAN-300 formulation was exposed to 1.2 million lux hours of white light and 200
   W/m 2 of UV energy. First, the samples were exposed to 8.00 k lux of cool white light for
   150 hours. Following this exposure, the samples were exposed to 10.00 W/m 2 UV light
15 for 20 hours. The chamber temperature was maintained at 5 'C for the duration of the
   study. A negative control for each formulation that is double wrapped with aluminum
   foil was subjected to identical conditions (i.e., the formulation controls). Following stress,
   the samples were removed from the stability chamber and stored at 2 'C to 8'C until
   analysis.
20
           Controls for Hydrolysis and Agitation Studies. To account for the effects of
   temperature in the hydrolysis and agitation stress studies, 1 vial of each SAN-300
   formulation was stored at 25'C for the duration of the hydrolysis/agitation studies, and
   then stored at 2 'C to 8'C until analysis.
25
           Deamidation/Base Hydrolysis. For base-catalyzed deamidation studies, 1 vial of
   each SAN-300 formulation was titrated to pH > 9.0 with 1 M Tris. The sample was then
   placed at 25 'C for three days. At the end of the incubation period, the sample was buffer
   exchanged back into the appropriate formulation buffer using a 10 kDa MWCO
30 concentrator (Millipore, Cat. No UFC801024) and stored at 2 'C to 8 'C until analysis.
                                               133

          Deamidation/Acid Hydrolysis. For acid-catalyzed deamidation studies, 1 vial of
   each SAN-300 formulation was titrated to pH 3.5 to pH 4.0 with 1 N HCl. The sample
   was then placed at 25 'C for three days. At the end of the incubation period, the sample
   was buffer exchanged back into the appropriate formulation buffer using a 10 kDa
 5 MWCO concentrator and stored at 2 'C to 8 'C until analysis.
          Agitation/Shear Stress. For agitation studies, 1 vial of each SAN-300
   formulation was placed vertically on a microplate shaker at ~650 rpm for three days at
   room temperature. Samples were then stored at 2 'C to 8C until analysis.
10
          Forced Oxidation Stress. For forced oxidation studies, 1 vial of each SAN-300
   formulation was spiked with hydrogen peroxide to a final concentration of 0.04% (V/V)
   and then incubated at 37 'C for 4 hours. At the end of the incubation period, the sample
   was buffer exchanged back into the appropriate formulation buffer using a 10 kDa
15 MWCO concentrator and stored at 2 'C to 8 'C until analysis.

           Example 5C. Sample Preparation for Formulation Development and Forced
15 De2radation studies
           Samples for use in formulation development and forced degradation studies were
   prepared as follows:
           1. 30 mM Acetate, 250 mM Sorbitol, 0.01% PS-80, pH 5.5
           2. 30 mM Histidine, 250 mM Sorbitol, 0.01% PS-20, pH 6.0
20         DoE samples had concentrations of -215 mg/mL and viscosity of 18 (acetate) and
   21 (histidine). For subcutaneous formulations, a theoretical viscosity target <15 cps is
   desired, and thus the concentrations were adjusted to bring viscosity into an acceptable
   range:
                   Acetate -190 mg/mL, 13.7 cps
25                 Histidine -180 mg/mL, 13.8 cps
           Thus, the final SAN-300 concentration of the acetate solution was 190 mg/mL,
   while the final SAN-300 concentration in histidine was 180 mg/mL.
                                              136

           Sample preparation. Buffer-exchange of SAN-300 into the candidate
   formulations was performed using Amicon Ultra- 15 concentrators (30k MWCO, Ultracel
   Membrane, Cat# UFC 903096). Assuming a target concentration of 180 mg/mL to
   190 mg/mL and a worst-case protein loss of 40%, a total of -90 mL of SAN-300 was
 5 buffer-exchanged into each candidate formulation (i.e., -12.4 g of starting material to be
   consumed in total), where a total of 12 Amicon concentrators was used in parallel for
   each formulation to process the required amount of SAN-300. The concentrators were
   rinsed with the appropriate buffer prior to the addition of protein. To each concentrator,
   7.5 mL of SAN-300 (69 mg/mL) was added, and then diluted to 15 mL with the
10 appropriate buffer. The volume was reduced to -7.5 mL by centrifugation, followed by
   dilution with the appropriate buffer to 15 mL. This process was repeated for a total of 4
   cycles. Following buffer exchange, the samples were concentrated to the target
   concentration and pooled. Final SAN-300 concentration of the samples was determined
   by UV-Vis spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of 1.53 mL/mg*cm.
15         Prior to final sample preparation, the osmolality measurements were performed
   using a freezing point depression osmometer. The Osmette XL 5007 osmometer was
   calibrated using deionized water (zero mOsm/kg), 100 mOsm/kg, and 500 mOsm/kg
   standard solutions before sample measurements. Following osmometer calibration,
   0.25 mL of sample was used for measurement. If needed, additional excipients may be
20 evaluated to target isotonic formulation composition (i.e., 280 to 350 mOsm/kg).
           Samples were syringe filtered using 0.22 im PVDF membranes (Millipore,
   Cat. # SLGVM33RS). Following filtration, samples were pooled and the concentration
   of SAN-300 again determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Samples allocated for Forced
   Degradation were filled (0.5 mL) into 2 mL Type 1 borosilicate glass vials (West
25 Pharmaceuticals Cat # 68000314) and stoppered with 13 mm Fluorotec stoppers (West
   Pharmaceuticals, Cat #19500040). A total of 9 vials was sealed for each formulation.
   Sample allocated for Formulation Development studies were placed in a 40 mL conical
   tube.
30         Samples were exchanged into the appropriate buffers and slightly
   over-concentrated, relative to the target SAN-300 concentration ((i) Acetate/Sorbitol/

           Overview
           Long-term stability studies were undertaken for SAN-300, an anti-VLA1 IgGI
   monoclonal antibody, to evaluate several formulations. The protein was formulated in 30
   mM histidine, 250 mM sorbitol, 0.01% PS-20, pH 6.0 and 30 mM acetate, 220 mM
15 sorbitol, 0.01% PS-80, pH 5.5 at both high (180-190 mg/mL) and low (120 mg/mL)
   concentrations for a total of four formulations. These samples were prepared by
   tangential flow filtration, sealed in type I borosilicate vials, and staged at prospective
   storage conditions (-75'C and 2-8'C), an accelerated condition (30'C/65% RH), and a
   stressed condition (40'C/75%RH). Samples were maintained under these conditions to
20 assess the chemical, physical, and structural stability of the protein. Lower concentration
   formulations were tested for a period of 6 months under all conditions. Both higher
   concentration formulations were evaluated through 12 months under all conditions, with
   the exception of samples stored at 40'C/75% RH, which were testedthrough 6 months.
                                                  139

   The results of the long term stability studies described in Examples 6-12 established that
   histidine was a superior buffering system to acetate, and that SAN-300 remained stable at
   -75'C and 2-8'C for up to 12 months at high concentration.

           The mass of permeate was recorded at each of these time points and permeate
10 volume determined. The pressure drop (dP; P Feed - P Ret) and transmembrane pressure
   (TMP; (P Feed + P Ret) / 2) were also calculated. For the acetate formulation, filtrate
   flow rate was recorded at each time point (Flux, mL/min), and this measurement was
   normalized for membrane area ((L*h-1) / m2).
           The concentrated drug substance was next exchanged into the appropriate
15 formulation buffer by seven rounds of continuous diafiltration (Table 20). For each
   diavolume, feed pressure, retentate pressure and filtration rate were measured, and the
   associated parameters calculated as described above. Flux was observed to increase by
   -50% for the acetate formulation, and -30% for the histidine formulation by the fifth
   diavolume.

       Following the completion of diafiltration, formulated drug substance was
   overconcentrated relative to the final SAN-300 target concentration (Table 17). The final
   pH and conductivity of the over-concentrated solutions were nearly identical to the
 5 associated diafiltration buffer (Table 17). After removing the sample, the TFF system was
   flushed with diafiltration buffer and the protein content of the flush determined. This
   flush was used to dilute the over-concentrated SAN-300 to a level only slightly above the
   final target (Table 17). The volume of this solution was determined by weight using a
   density of 1.089 g/mL. Finally, the percent yield was estimated using protein content
10 determinations made throughout TFF processing (Table 21). While no apparent SAN-300
   loss was observed for the acetate formulation, exchange into histidine buffer resulted in a
   yield of 89%.

   To reach the final target concentration, a small volume of formulation buffer including
   the sample-appropriate polysorbate (acetate, PS-80; histidine, PS-20) was added to
   achieve a surfactant concentration of 0.0 1%. A 40 mL aliquot of formulated SAN-300 at
   the target concentration was removed and diluted to 120 mg/mL using formulation buffer
10 including 0.0 1% polysorbate. A total of four SAN-300 formulations were generated at the

            Example 7: Viscosity and Osmolality of SAN-300 Formulations
            The viscosity of SAN-300 formulations (as described in Example 6) was assessed
10 at at the initial time point. Osmolality of the formulations was assessed at the initial time
   point and after 1 and 3 months of storage at 2-8 0 C.
            Methods
            Methods for Assessing Viscosity. A shear rheometer was calibrated with
   Brookfield viscosity standard fluid #10, and 0.5 mL of sample was measured at various
15 spindle speeds (shear rates). Samples displaying constant viscosity (cP) readings over all
   shear rates were considered Newtonian over this range, while samples with shear rate
   dependent viscosity values would be considered non-Newtonian.
            Methods for AssessingOsmolality.              Osmolality measurements were performed
   using a freezing point depression osmometer, which measures the decrease in a solution's
20 freezing point as solute concentration increases. The Osmette XL 5007 osmometer was
   calibrated using deionized water (zero mOsm/kg), 100 mOsm/kg, and 500 mOsm/kg
   standard solutions.
            Following the osmometer calibration, 250 [tL of sample was measured.

             Viscosity Results. Formulation viscosity was evaluated for all formulations at the
   initial time point. The results are shown in Table 24. Newtonian behavior was observed
10 for all samples, where both high concentration histidine and acetate formulations
   displayed viscosities < 15 cP (11.9 and 13.7 cP, respectively). Low concentration
   histidine and acetate formulation viscosities were 4.3 and 4.4 cP, respectively. All
   viscosities measured were consistent with historical values.
             Osmolality Results. Osmolality measurements were performed at the initial time
15 point (Table 24). Readings for both high-concentration acetate (295 mOsm/kg) and
   histidine (289 mOsm/kg) formulations were somewhat lower than historical values and,
   thus, re-evaluation of sample osmolality was performed at 1 and 3 months using samples
   stored at 2-8'C. The resulting values for the acetate formulation were 318 and 310
   mOsm/kg for samples at 1 month and 3 months, respectively, while histidine-containing
20 samples showed osmolality of 331 and 319 mOsm/kg. These data were fully consistent
   with historical readings, and show that sample osmolality remained constant within this
   time-frame. The osmolality of low concentration acetate and histidine formulations at the
   3 month time point was 321 and 316 mOsm/kg, respectively.

           Example 9: Lon2 Term Stability of SAN-300 Formulations: Appearance,
   Protein Content, and pH
           The appearance, protein content, and pH of SAN-300 Formulations was assessed
   to determine their long term stability using the experimental design described in Example
 5 7.
           Methods
           Appearance. Prior to unsealing vials for analytical testing, sample appearance
   was evaluated against a white and dark background. Each sample was tested against an
   identical vial filled with DI water for color, clarity (opalescence), and the presence of
10 visible particulate matter.
           Protein Content andpH. Protein content and pH were assessed as described in
   Example 7.

                    Appearance. Visual inspection of unopened sample vials was used to evaluate
          sample color, clarity, and the presence of particulate matter. As shown in Table 25, all
    5     samples were slightly opalescent and essentially free of visible particles, where high
          concentration formulations were noticeably more yellow than those at low concentration.
          While somewhat increased yellow color was observed in histidine formulations
          maintained at higher temperatures (after 6 months at 40'C, 12 months at 30'C),
          formulations generally displayed consistent appearance by visual evaluation over the
   10     course of the study.

            Protein Content Protein content was assessed for all samples over the course of
   the stability study (Table 25). No detectable loss of SAN-300 was observed for any of the
   formulations, regardless of storage conditions.
           pH. Formulation pH was measured for all study samples. The initial pH readings
 5 for high concentration histidine and acetate formulations were 6.2 and 5.6, respectively.
   As shown in Table 25, pH remained constant throughout the duration of the study, not
   varying more than 0.1 units from the initial reading in any formulation.

10 Matter
            The particulate matter in SAN-300 Formulations was assessed to determine their
   long term stability using the experimental design described in Example 7.
            Methods for Assessing Particulate Matter
            A Liquid Particle Counting System (Hach Model 9703, Sensor Model: HRLD
15 150 (HIAC)) was used for determining particle size and abundance in SAN-300 samples.
   The data was obtained using a single 500 [tL draw of sample. Due to the small sample
   volumes used in this study, the results generated do not fulfill USP <788> "Particulate
   Matter in Injections" requirements.
            Briefly, the HIAC system was allowed to warm up for approximately 30 minutes,
20 and both the syringe (1 mL) and system were flushed with deionized water for at least 10
   cycles before use. Environment suitability was tested by showing that 25 mL of deionized
   water contained no more than 25 particles> 10 pim in size. If environment suitability
   failed, the system was flushed with deionized water until a passing measurement was
   obtained. System suitability was confirmed by analyzing a single 500 IL draw of 15 ptm
25 standard using 10 pm and 25 pm channel sizes. If cumulative counts/mL for the 10 ptm
   channel fell within the specification given for the standard, then the system was deemed
   suitable for sample testing. Before each sample, the system was again flushed with
   deionized water, until a single 500 pL draw of deionized water showed no particles
   greater than 10 pm in size. Sample was analyzed using a single 500 piL draw, and
30 cumulative counts/mL for 10 pim and 25 im channels were determined and reported to
   the nearest whole number.

  For all formulations and conditions, particle counts were well below the particle limits for
5 injection set by USP <788> (6000 for 10 pLm, and 600 for 25 tm particles). All
  formulations adequately suppressed particle formation during long-term SAN-300
  storage under both intended storage conditions (-75'C and 2-8'C ) and accelerated or
  stressed conditions (30C or 40'C).

           Example 11: Long Term Stability of SAN-300 Formulations: Purity
           The purity of SAN-300 Formulations was assessed with reduced SDS-PAGE and
   size exclusion chromatography using the experimental design described in Example 7.
           Methods
 5         Reduced Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to assess SAN-300 sample purity by size
   separation of sample proteins/peptides. Samples, controls and reference standard were
   prepared to 2.0 mg/mL in IX Tris-Glycine SDS sample buffer (containing NuPAGE@
   sample reducing agent), centrifuged, and heat denatured for 1 minute at 95'C followed by
10 an additional centrifugation step. Gels were loaded at 20 pig per lane, and electrophoresis
   was performed for 60 minutes at maximum voltage, 250 watts, and 30 mAmp/gel.
   Following electrophoresis, gels were stained for a minimum of 3 hours with Colloidal
   Blue and destained overnight. Gels were dried with a DryEase@ mini-gel drying system,
   imaged, and analyzed by densitometry using the GeneGenius Bioimaging system.
15         The percent heavy chain (HC), light chain (LC), and IgG were determined from
   densitometry data for each SDS-PAGE sample, in addition to total lane density (raw
   volume). To better account for variability between gels, the abundances of HC, LC, and
   IgG were reported relative to the internal reference standard run on each gel. For
   visualization purposes, percent IgG loss was also reported. Material from both Lots of
20 SAN-300 (CP4-04-109 and CP4-04-106) used to generate stability samples were run at
   To and deemed equivalent. CP4-04-109 was used as reference for the remainder of the
   study.
           Size Exclusion Chromatography. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was
   used to evaluate the quantity of aggregates and degradation products present in SAN-300
25 samples. An Agilent 1100 HPLC system was fitted with a TSKgel G3000SWxl SEC
   column (Tosoh, 7.8 mm x 30 cm, 5 pim particle size) and SWxl guard column (Tosoh, 6
   mm x 4 cm, 7 jim particle size). Samples were diluted to 1 mg/mL in SEC mobile phase
   (100 mM sodium phosphate, 200 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.2) and 40 jiL of sample was
   injected in duplicate. The system was run using a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, and eluted
30 protein was detected by absorbance measured at 215 nm. The percent total chromatogram
   area was reported for the monomer peak, in addition to each individual high molecular
                                                160

   weight (HMW) species and low molecular weight impurity (LMWI). Material from both
   Lots of SAN-300 (CP4-04-109 and CP4-04-106) used to generate stability samples were
   run at TO and deemed equivalent. CP4-04-109 was used as reference for the remainder of
   the study. Samples were run in the following sequence order: blank (lx), reference (lx),
 5 samples (2x), reference (lx), blank (lx), where a bracketing reference injection was
   performed after every 15 samples (30 injections).
           Results
           Reduced Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis. The purity of all stability samples
   was evaluated by reduced SDS-PAGE. The results are shown in Table 27.

   and IgG in stability samples were reported relative to values obtained for the internal
 5 reference run on each gel. In addition, the percent IgG loss was also reported.
            Both high-concentration formulations trended comparably under all storage
   conditions and remained stable after 12 months at 2-80 C. Histidine slightly outperformed
   acetate at a majority of time points for 2-80 C and 30'C samples. Small reductions in IgG
   content (-5%) were observed for upright 2-80 C samples for both formulations after 12
10 months, with comparable results for inverted samples held at this temperature. Twelve
   month samples maintained at -75 0 C for both formulations were comparable to
   measurements at the initial time point. Lower SAN-300 concentration samples showed a
   small apparent increase in stability, relative to associated high-concentration solutions.
   While this concentration-dependent effect on intact IgG was nearly undetectable at 2-80 C
15 at the six month time point, it was more pronounced at elevated temperatures (> 5% at
   400 C).

   Similar to SDS-PAGE data, SEC results showed that high-concentration SAN-300
   formulated in histidine results in reduced degradation of monomer relative to acetate. At
   the 12 month time point, histidine samples at 2-8'C (96.6% monomer) were nearly
 5 indistinguishable from material at the initial time point (96.9% monomer), while the
   acetate formulation displayed somewhat elevated levels of HMW material (FIG. 5). Data
   for inverted and frozen samples for both formulations were comparable to results for the
   upright 2-8'C samples. Samples under accelerated and stressed conditions revealed more
   dramatic differences between the performances of the two high-concentration
10 formulations. At the 6 month time point for example, 40'C histidine samples showed
   monomer content of -84%, while counterpart acetate samples showed only -80%. These
   differences in monomer content were associated almost entirely with aggregate content,
   as LMWI formation did not appear to be buffer-dependent. As shown in the
   representative overlays presented in FIG. 6, a total of three HMW species were observed
15 over the course of the study, where Aggregate 1 (dimer) represented the majority of
   HMW content. Formation of the higher-order Aggregates 2 and 3 was both temperature
   and buffer-dependent, where histidine was again superior to acetate buffer. In addition to
   the SAN-300 fragment LMWI 2, observed in all samples to varying degrees, accelerated
   and stressed conditions led to the formation of LMWI 1, which presented as a trailing
20 shoulder off the monomer peak.
           Results for low-concentration formulations mirrored those described above,
   where acetate-buffered samples displayed reduced monomer content compared with
   corresponding histidine samples (Table 28). As would be expected, both low
   concentration formulations had reduced propensity for aggregate formation relative to
25 their high-concentration counterparts. This effect was strongly temperature dependent,
   where differences in total aggregate between low and high-concentration samples were
   -0.5% for 2-8'C samples and up to 3.5% for those at 40'C. Fragmentation into LMWI
   was not SAN-300 concentration-dependent.

            Example 12: Lon2 Term Stability of SAN-300 Formulations: Charge
   Heterogeneity
            The charge heterogeneity of SAN-300 formulations was assessed with cation
   exchange chromatography using the experimental design described in Example 7.
 5          Method
            An Agilent 1100 HPLC system was fitted with a ProPac WCX- 10 CEX column
   (Dionex, 4 x 250 mm) and a Propac WCX-10G Guard Column, (Dionex, 4 x 50 mm).
   SAN-300 samples were diluted to 1.0 mg/mL in mobile phase A (10 mM sodium
   phosphate, pH 7.5) and 75 ptL was injected in duplicate. A gradient was run using buffer
10 B (10 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.5) and buffer C (10 mM
   sodium phosphate, 2 M sodium chloride, pH 7.5), where protein was detected by
   absorbance measured at 280 nm.
            The abundances of main peak, acidic variants, and basic variants were reported
   for each sample as percent total chromatogram peak area. The two Lots of SAN-300
15 (CP4-04-109 and CP4-04-106) used to generate formulations for the present study
   displayed slightly different charge profiles as determined by CEX. To account for this
   variability, percent main, acidic, and basic species were also reported relative to the Lot
   appropriate reference standard run within a given HPLC sequence. Samples were run in
   the following sequence order: blank (lx), CP4-04-109 reference (lx), CP4-04-106
20 reference (lx), samples (2x), CP4-04-109 reference (lx), CP4-04-106 reference, blank
   (lx), where bracketing reference injections were performed after every 15 samples (30
   injections).
            Results
            Charge heterogeneity was determined by CEX for all stability samples. The
25 results are shown in Table 29 and Table 30. The percent abundances of main peak, and
   total acidic and basic charge variants were reported.

             aDue   to excessive degradation, samples were not integrated.
     Unlike other analytical methods used in the present study, a small variation in charge
     heterogeneity was observed between the two SAN-300 Lots used in preparation of the
 5   study samples. For this reason, CEX results were also reported as the percent change,
     relative to the lot specific reference standard run in a given HPLC sequence (see Table
     30).

   NB1206p86A and NB1206p86B showed similar trends at 30'C and 40'C, with the
   histidine formulation consistently retaining more of its initial charge profile. The shift to
   more acidic variants at elevated temperatures was not found to be concentration
 5 dependent, as low-concentration samples were indistinguishable from associated high
   concentration samples.
             Conclusions
             Both high-concentration formulations displayed excellent stability for up to 12
   months under intended storage conditions (-75 0 C and 2-80 C). Results from SEC, SDS
10 PAGE and CEX indicate that compared with the acetate formulation, the histidine
   formulation provides better SAN-300 stability.
